       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 13-year-old Israeli boy hiking with his father on Mount Carmel stumbled across an 1,800 year-old bronze ring engraved with the image of the mythological Roman goddess Minerva, the Israel Antiquities Authority said on Wednesday.</p>

<p>"While hiking I noticed a small green item and picked it up. It was corroded, and at first, I thought it was just a rusty bolt. I thought about heating it, but then fortunately I understood it was a ring. At home, I saw it had an image on it. At first glance, I thought it was a warrior," said Yair Whiteson, of Haifa.</p>

<p>The ring, preserved in its entirety, features the image of a helmeted naked figure holding a shield in one hand and a spear in the other.</p>

<p>Yair, accompanied by his father, who had just returned from a four-month stint in the army reserves, was passing through Khirbet Shalala, an area known for its remains of a Roman farmstead and a nearby ancient rock quarry. Yair's curiosity was piqued by a small, green item lying on the ground. "I'm curious about fossils and rocks and love to collect them," Yair explained, adding that it became apparent that this was not a fossil.</p>

<p>Recognising the potential value of the ring, the family contacted the Antiquities Authority.</p>

<p>Dr Eitan Klein and Nir Distelfeld of the Antiquities Authority identified the figure as Minerva from Roman mythology, also known as Athena in Greek mythology.</p>

<p>"Yair's identification of the figure as a warrior is very close to reality," they explained. "This goddess, who was very popular during the Roman period in the Land of Israel, was considered, among other things, as the goddess of war and military strategy, and also as the goddess of wisdom."</p>

<p>The researchers dated the ring back to the Late Roman Period, the 2nd-3rd Century CE.</p>

<p>Khirbet Shalala also features burial caves at the edge of the quarry, raising speculation about the ring's origins.</p>

<p>"The ring may have belonged to a woman who lived on this farm. Or, it might have fallen from a quarry worker, or it may have been a burial offering from these nearby graves. There are many possibilities," the researchers noted.<br />
The ring will be displayed in Jerusalem.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[As the world prepares for what's likely to be a neck-and-neck contest between Joe Biden and Donald Trump in US polls, there's another aspect of these elections worth taking note of - its India connection.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It's been an eventful month in US politics ahead of the November 5 presidential elections. First, President Joe Biden came under severe criticism for what many described as an abysmal performance in the first presidential debate. And then, last Saturday, his Republican counterpart Donald Trump was shot at during a rally in Pennsylvania. The former president survived the attack with a minor injury on his ear.</p>

<p>As the world prepares for what's likely to be a neck-and-neck contest between the two candidates, there's another aspect of these elections worth taking note of - its India connection.</p>

<p>Four years ago, it was Kamala Harris, who created history when she became the US Vice President. This time, there's another individual with roots in India. It's Usha Vance, the wife of JD Vance, who is former President Donald Trump's running mate.</p>

<p>Kamala Harris traces her roots in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu where her mother, Shyamala Gopalan, was born. Ms Shyamala went to the US as a teenager to pursue a PhD at the University of California, Berkeley. There, she met Donald J. Harris, and the two got married in 1963. They had two daughters, Kamala Harris (born 1964) and Maya.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Usha Chilukuri Vance was born to immigrant parents from Chilakaluripeta, Andhra Pradesh. She graduated from Yale University with a degree in History, then earned her M.Phil in Early Modern History from Columbia University, and a JD in Law from Yale Law School. She has worked in prestigious law firms and at the US Supreme Court as a legal clerk.</p>

<p>If Biden wins, Kamala Harris will continue her role as Vice President. However, if Trump and Vance emerge victorious, Usha Vance will become the Second Lady and will live at the Naval Observatory.</p>

<p>Recent polls show the popularity of candidates among US voters. According to YouGov, Kamala Harris is liked by 49 per cent of people, while only 28 per cent approve of JD Vance. The poll also shows that many Americans are still deciding what they think about Vance, who is still little-known in presidential politics.</p>

<p>A year ago, in July 2023, Republican and Indian-origin <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/hirsh-vardhan-singh-announces-2024-presidential-bid-becomes-3rd-indian-american-to-join-crowded-republican-party-hopefuls-4251326">Hirsh Vardhan Singh</a> announced his bid for the US President in 2024 against Donald Trump who was facing legal challenges. He had filed his candidacy and declared himself a "lifelong Republican" and "America First" conservative. He also referred to himself as the "only pureblood candidate" because he "never gave in to the COVID vaccinations."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Imagine doing a 36-hour shift in a hospital and then turning up willingly the next day to chip away the imperfections to become a beauty queen? That is what Shruti Hegde, a doctor and a beauty queen from Hubli, Karnataka, has been doing since 2018.</p>

<p>This Kannadiga's hard work has paid off though.</p>

<p>A little over a month ago, on June 10, Shruti Hegde became India's first Miss Universal Petite, a pageant that was started in 2009 to give opportunity to shorter women, who found themselves often dwarfed by the amazonian standards when it comes to height.</p>

<p>The pageantry is held in Tampa, Florida in the United States of America, every year.</p>

<p>“It was not easy for sure. I realised that being a doctor is a lot more work than I initially thought. Yes, it becomes too much at times. But I don't think I will be choosing one over the other. Instead, I want to find a balance between both,” said Hegde to PTI.</p>

<p>When she took the pageantry route, Hegde said she never gave much thought to winning.</p>

<p>“I am always wanting to do new things, and I guess it is almost every small-town girl's dream – to be a beauty queen. So, I thought I'll just give it a try. It helped that I had a mother who is keener than me that I should do what I want to do,” said Hegde.</p>

<p>That is how Hedge found herself signing up for Miss Dharwad contest in 2018. But when she won the contest, things took a serious turn.</p>

<p>“During the course of the contest, I realized that I was learning a lot of life lessons too – the kind that will help me be a better person and be better equipped to tackle any kind of situation. So, I decided to give my all to it, and see where it took me,” said Hegde, who is currently pursuing MD in dermatology and working as an intern at a hospital in Tumakuru, a city about 70 km away from Bengaluru.</p>

<p>But she soon hit the next roadblock. Not only did a small town like Hubballi have the necessary means for all the preparations required to become a beauty queen, but she also had to take a break and deal with a medical emergency.</p>

<p>“In 2019, I was diagnosed with benign ovarian and uterine tumours and had to undergo open surgery. This ate up two years of my life – 2019 and 2020 – as I recuperated. I thought that was the end of my pageantry career for a while. Again, my mother wouldn't let me off so easily. She stood behind me like a rock,” said Hegde.</p>

<p>And so, Hegde said she bounced back, went tripping all over India, taking classes to get herself the poised look of a beauty queen.</p>

<p>“There's so much to it – diction, clothing, walking… And initially, you will have to spend for all that, in lakhs and lakhs. But by now nothing could stop me, I wanted to go all the way,” said Hedge.</p>

<p>Once she won a big title – the second runner up of Miss Asia International India 2023 – financial strain lessened a lot, said Hegde.</p>

<p>“I started getting sponsors for my clothes and stuff. Which was a relief because earlier I had only a couple of outfits that I was forced to wear to different pageantries,” Hegde.</p>

<p>As expected, pageantry opened other doors in the entertainment industry. Since 2023, Hegde said she has been receiving offers to act in serials and films.</p>

<p>“Again, I ventured into it cautiously. Started first with serials. But the film that I just finished shooting for, ‘Sharanara Shakti', made me realise a film career may not be a bad thing,” added Hegde.</p>

<p>Hegde said she just played a dancer in the period film that traces the life of the 12th century philosopher, poet and social reformer Basavanna.</p>

<p>“I realised that the Kannada film industry is again opening itself, making it possible for films like ‘Sharanara Shakti'. It's perhaps the best time to be an actor here. I have now decided to take that plunge and see where it goes,” said Hegde.</p>

<p>Hegde added that she is shooting right now for ‘Janumadata', another odd-ball film that explores the undercurrent of the tense relationship between a father and son.</p>

<p>“I play the lead this time – the girlfriend who encourages the guy to face things head-on even as he struggles to accept his father as he is,” said Hegde.

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a significant departure from tradition, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have changed the surnames of their children. Recently, the couple launched its new website, <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://sussex.com&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1721292383731000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1fTMnJd6dlVe7rK2TRlQcr" href="http://sussex.com/" target="_blank">sussex.com</a>, where many noticed the change, the Mirror reported.</p>

<p>Princess Lilibet and Prince Archie have now taken the surname Sussex, instead of Mountbatten-Windsors.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In 1960, Mountbatten-Windsor was decreed by the Privy Counsel, the official advisors to the late Queen Elizabeth II. The surname is applied to the male-line descendants of Elizabeth II and Prince Philip.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A source told The Times that the reality behind Harry and Meghan's new website is "very simple — it's a hub for the work the Sussexes do and it reflects the fact the family have, since the King's coronation, the same surname for the first time."&nbsp;</p>

<p>The source noted this was a "big deal for any family."&nbsp;</p>

<p>"It represents their unification and it's a proud moment," the source added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the couple's decision to use their children's royal titles has come as a bit "surprising," with many accusing them of boasting their links to the Britain's Royal family.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Once you open the website, the homepage welcomes users to the official site of "The Office of Prince Harry &amp; Meghan, The Duke &amp; Duchess of Sussex". Besides this, it also features a special coat of arms, especially designed for Meghan.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The website also offers a detailed bio for each of them -- Harry and Meghan -- separately.</p>

<p>"Prince Harry lives in California with his wife Meghan, and their two children Prince Archie and Princess Lilibet," reads Harry's bio.</p>

<p>Mentioning their children as 'Prince' and 'Princess' has caused "surprise," a source told Mirror.</p>

<p>Archie and Lilibet weren't provided the titles at the time of birth because back then they were not grandchildren of the monarch. After Charlies became the King in 2022, the two of them became the grandchildren of a Monarch, thereby changing their status.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Climate change is little more than an afterthought for attendees at the Republican National Convention, who are gathered this week to crown Donald Trump as their party's nominee for this November's election.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Climate change is little more than an afterthought for attendees at the Republican National Convention, who are gathered this week to crown Donald Trump as their party's nominee for this November's election.</p>

<p>"I don't believe all that," said Jack Prendergast, from New York, who believes that human activity does just as much harm to the planet as "when a volcano goes off."</p>

<p>"Trump is going to drill pipelines and we'll become the leading supplier of energy in the world, in the gas and the oil," Prendergast told AFP.</p>

<p>And the former president has promised as much -- adopting the slogan "drill, baby, drill" to sum up his fossil fuel-friendly approach.</p>

<p>Trump, who withdrew the United States from the Paris climate accord during his first term, on Monday appointed a fellow climate skeptic as his running mate: Ohio Senator J.D. Vance.</p>

<p>The 39-year-old, who would become Trump's vice president if they are elected, has previously accused Democrats of stirring up fears about climate change for political gain.</p>

<p>The two men will run on a 5,000-word Republican platform adopted on Monday by the party's delegates which makes no mention of plans for climate change or renewable energy.</p>

<p>Instead, it promises to end "green" policies it deems "socialist," and says the United States will become the world's number one oil and natural gas producer -- a position it already holds, according to official data.</p>

<p>Trump himself has said he is opposed to wind power -- a widely-touted alternative to fossil fuels -- as he is convinced it "kills all the birds."</p>

<h2><strong>'Bright future'&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p>Climate groups such as the Sunrise Movement have criticized the Republican platform, saying the party "has made it clear that they're happy to make the climate crisis worse."</p>

<p>But for Stephen Perkins of the American Conservation Coalition -- perhaps the only booth at the Republican convention focused on preserving the planet -- you have to take Trump's comments with "a grain of salt."</p>

<p>"I think that some of his comments are meant to be more entertaining than policy positions," said the 29-year-old, wearing a striped blue polo shirt.</p>

<p>His organization is hoping to show what a "conservative approach to environmental policy and climate policy look like," which he thinks could entice younger voters.</p>

<p>But he concedes it's a "slow process," with older Republicans averse to agreeing to action on climate change.</p>

<p>According to a Yale survey published on Tuesday, more than two-thirds of Americans do believe in the existence of climate change.</p>

<p>However, that does not necessarily translate into support for Democratic President Joe Biden, who has pushed through several initiatives to combat global warming during his time in office.</p>

<p>Perkins instead believes Biden is at the mercy of a "radical sect" of progressives "that doesn't engage in nuance." His convention stand shows the word "destruction" alongside images of left-wing environmental activists throwing soup at a work of art.</p>

<p>If he had it his way, he would show that "we have a bright future ahead" despite the challenges of climate change, instead of "the doom and gloom."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The news has sparked a frenzy on social media, with many noticing that the couple unfollowed each other on Instagram and deleted all photos of each other from their profiles. Some speculated the pair had blocked each other, while others wondered if Ms Sheikha Mahra's account had been hacked.</p>

<p>“Bad news. God bless you,” a user commented under the post.</p>

<p>Another wrote, “I am proud. Your Decision.”</p>

<p>A user applauded the princess for her “courage and bravery”, saying, “It is just a phase of life and it will continue with good and bitterness and life doesn't stop for anybody.”<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, someone asked, “But the divorce will occur from Husband's side, right? And Wife has to choose Khul'?"</p>

<p>The couple got married in May last year, and they welcomed their daughter 12 months later. Ms Sheikha Mahra had gushed about her "most memorable experience" giving birth, thanking her doctor and hospital staff for their care. In photos, her husband, Sheikh Mana, was seen cradling their little one in his arms.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Just weeks ago, the princess had shared a cryptic post on Instagram, cuddling with her baby, writing, "Just the two of us." Was that a possible hint at the trouble brewing beneath the surface?&nbsp;</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Greece's most visited tourist attraction, the Athens Acropolis, is to close during the hottest hours of Wednesday, authorities said as a heatwave scorches the country.</p>

<p>Tourists won't be able to visit the Parthenon and other ancient masterpieces atop the UNESCO-listed archaeological site between noon and 5:00 pm local time (0900-1400 GMT), the culture ministry said.</p>

<p>The limited closure -- which is the second announced in just over a month -- comes as Greece's national weather service predicted temperatures above 43 degrees Celsius (109 degrees Fahrenheit) in parts of the country.</p>

<p>Greece's earliest-ever heatwave forced the Acropolis to close for the hottest hours of the day for two days in a row in June.</p>

<p>A record number of almost four million visitors flocked to the Acropolis in 2023, its popularity boosted in part due to tourists arriving on cruise ships calling in at the nearby port of Piraeus.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As questions swirl over how a would-be assassin managed to get anywhere near Donald Trump, some conservatives are blaming the Secret Service for hiring the women agents who threw themselves into the line of fire to protect the former president.</p>

<p>Women are too short, too weak -- and in some cases, too overweight -- to protect someone like Trump, according to people on the US political right who accused the Secret Service of "woke" hiring practices they say nearly got the former president killed.</p>

<p>Several women can be seen among the black-suited, sunglass-clad agents racing to shield Trump with their bodies as the gunman opened fire at a rally in Pennsylvania on Saturday, before hustling him from the stage and into a waiting car and safety.</p>

<p>But they, along with their boss Kimberly Cheatle -- only the second-ever woman director of the federal agency tasked with protecting presidents current, former and would-be -- are now caught in the intense scrutiny over the nearly catastrophic attack.</p>

<p>"There should not be any women in the Secret Service. These are supposed to be the very best, and none of the very best at this job are women," right-wing activist Matt Walsh wrote on X, in one typical post.</p>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>"I can't imagine that a DEI hire from @pepsi would be a bad choice as the head of the Secret Service. #sarcasm," tweeted Republican congressman Tim Burchett.</p>

<p>Burchett was referring to Cheatle's previous job as director of global security for Pepsi -- a post she held for several years before returning to the Secret Service, where she had previously spent nearly three decades.</p>

<p>With the phrase DEI -- diversity, equity and inclusion -- he was invoking one of the most popular conservative fronts in the culture wars: the so-called "wokeification" of the workplace as employers strive to diversify their hiring practices beyond white men.</p>

<p>The first women were sworn in as Secret Service agents in 1971. CBS News reported last year that the agency aims to have 30 per cent women recruits by 2030.</p>

<p>"I'm very conscious ... of making sure that we need to attract diverse candidates and ensure that we are developing and giving opportunities to everybody in our workforce, and particularly women," Cheatle told CBS at the time.</p>

<p>The wildly popular conservative Libs of TikTok account cited that interview in a post also blaming hiring practices for the Trump shooting that has received more than 10 million views on X.</p>

<p>"The results of DEI. DEI got someone killed," it read.</p>

<h3><strong>'Secret Service A-team'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Diverse hiring practices accelerated in 2020 after the George Floyd killing forced America into a new reckoning over racism and inclusivity.</p>

<p>But they have seen a growing backlash from conservatives in recent months who complain they unfairly disadvantage white workers in general, and white men in particular.</p>

<p>None other than Ohio Senator J.D. Vance -- Trump's newly-announced running mate -- has spearheaded a recent bill to do away with such efforts.</p>

<p>"DEI is racism, plain and simple. It's time to outlaw it nationwide, starting with the federal government," he tweeted last month as the bill was introduced.</p>

<p>Such practices at the Secret Service faced scrutiny as recently as May, when Congress launched an investigation after a female agent in Vice President Kamala Harris's detail reportedly got into an altercation with colleagues.</p>

<p>The incident raised concerns about this agent's hiring, Kentucky Republican James Comer said in a letter to Cheatle -- specifically, whether staff shortages "had led the agency to lower once stricter standards as a part of a diversity, equity and inclusion effort."</p>

<p>The Secret Service did not immediately respond to questions from AFP.</p>

<p>But in response to the Comer letter, spokesman Anthony Guglielmi told US media that Secret Service employees "are held to the highest professional standards... at no time has the agency lowered these standards."</p>

<p>Cheatle has shrugged off calls for her resignation since the shooting, and the agency has agreed to cooperate with an independent review ordered by President Joe Biden.</p>

<p>Comer has also announced that Cheatle will appear before a congressional panel on July 22 for a hearing on the assassination attempt.</p>

<p>Biden -- in whose detail Cheatle served when he was vice president -- told NBC News on Monday that he feels "safe with the Secret Service," though he agreed it was an "open question" whether they should have anticipated the shooting.</p>

<p>When Trump made his first public appearance after the shooting, at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee on Monday, he appeared to be surrounded by an all-male Secret Service detail.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[San Francisco, July 17 (IANS) Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk on Wednesday said he will move the headquarters of its aerospace company as well as social media platform X from the US state of California.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk today said he will move the headquarters of its aerospace company as well as social media platform X from the US state of California.</p>

<p>Musk's decision came after California Governor Gavin Newsom signed a new law that prevents schools from requiring employees to notify parents if students want to use names or pronouns other than what's on their birth certificates.</p>

<p>"This is the final straw. Because of this law and the many others that preceded it, attacking both families and companies," the tech billionaire posted.</p>

<p>"SpaceX will now move its HQ from Hawthorne, California, to Starbase, Texas," Musk added.</p>

<p>He further said that he did make it clear to Governor Newsom about a year ago that "laws of this nature would force families and companies to leave California to protect their children".</p>

<p>"Authorities keep saying it will get better, but it doesn't. Last week was the worst experience ever. Crime is allowed to run rampant in California," the Tesla CEO lamented.</p>

<p>Musk has already shifted Tesla headquarters from California to Texas.</p>

<p>An X user posted: "Congratulations on making this choice. The beautiful thing about a republic of 50 states is that if one state becomes tyrannical, we have the choice as Americans to leave and go somewhere that better reflects our values".</p>

<p>The SpaceX headquarters will be moved out of Hawthorne, California, to Starbase, a SpaceX complex and launch site near Brownsville, Texas.</p>

<p>X social media platform will also move its headquarters from San Francisco, California to Austin, Texas.</p>

<p>"Have had enough of dodging gangs of violent drug addicts just to get in and out of the building," said Musk.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iran on Wednesday rejected what it called "malicious" accusations by US media implicating it in a plot to kill former US president Donald Trump.</p>

<p>CNN reported Tuesday that US authorities received intelligence from a "human source" weeks ago on an alleged Iranian plot against the former president, prompting his protection to be boosted. Other US outlets also reported the alleged plot.</p>

<p>CNN said the alleged plot was not linked to Saturday's shooting at a Trump campaign rally in Pennsylvania, in which the former president was wounded and a supporter killed.</p>

<p>The US National Security Council said it had been "tracking Iranian threats against former Trump administration officials for years" after Tehran threatened revenge for the 2020 killing of Revolutionary Guards commander Qasem Soleimani in a US drone strike in neighbouring Iraq.</p>

<p>Iran's mission to the United Nations called the accusations "unsubstantiated and malicious".</p>

<p>Foreign ministry spokesman Nasser Kanani said Iran "strongly rejects any involvement in the recent armed attack against Trump".</p>

<p>He added however that Iran remains "determined to prosecute Trump over his direct role in the assassination of General Qasem Soleimani".</p>

<p>Soleimani headed the foreign operations arm of Iran's Revolutionary Guards, overseeing Iranian military operations across the Middle East.</p>

<p>Trump ordered his killing in a drone strike just outside Baghdad airport.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The world reacted with horror 10 years ago when Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 was shot down over war-torn eastern Ukraine as it flew from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur.</p>

<p>The crash came in the early stages of a war in which Moscow seized the Crimean Peninsula from Kyiv and stoked an insurgency by pro-Russian rebels in Ukraine's east.</p>

<h3><strong>What happened?&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>The doomed flight took off from Amsterdam on a bright summer's day on July 17, 2014.</p>

<p>Among the passengers were Dutch HIV/AIDS expert Joep Lange, on his way to a conference in Melbourne, and Jeroen and Nicole Wals and their four children, who were Malaysia-bound on a holiday.</p>

<p>At 4:19 pm (1319 GMT), while flying over eastern Ukraine's Donetsk region where pro-Russian separatist rebels were battling Ukraine forces, the plane exploded in mid-air, at an altitude of 33,000 feet (10.1 kilometres).</p>

<p>All 298 people on board were killed, 196 of them Dutch, as well as 43 Malaysians and 38 Australians.</p>

<p>A later reconstruction of the jet using some of the wreckage revealed the horror of the plane's last moments.</p>

<p>"The forward section of the aircraft was penetrated by hundreds of high-energy objects coming from the warhead," a Dutch-led international investigation heard.</p>

<p>"As a result of the impact and the subsequent blast, the three crew members in the cockpit were killed immediately and the aeroplane broke up in the air."</p>

<p>The investigators said some of the passengers may have known for up to 90 seconds that they were about to die.</p>

<h3><strong>Who was held responsible?&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Russia and Ukraine immediately traded blame for the plane's downing.</p>

<p>The international probe in 2016 found "irrefutable evidence" that the plane was downed by a Russian-made BUK surface-to-air missile system which was transported from Russia to separatist-controlled eastern Ukraine.</p>

<p>Investigators later determined that the missile originated in a Russian military brigade based in the western city of Kursk.</p>

<p>Russia denied that any anti-aircraft missile crossed the border.</p>

<p>In June 2019, four senior figures in east Ukraine's self-styled rebel Donetsk People's Republic, Igor Girkin, Sergei Dubinsky and Oleg Pulatov of Russia, and Leonid Kharchenko of Ukraine were charged with murder.</p>

<p>They were accused of bringing the missile system to the launch site in eastern Ukraine (but not of actually pressing the button).</p>

<p>The investigators said there were "strong indications" that Russian President Vladimir Putin approved the supply of the missile.</p>

<h3><strong>Was anyone convicted?&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>After a two-and-a-half-year trial, a Dutch court in November 2022 convicted Girkin, Dubinsky, and Kharchenko in absentia of murder and intentionally causing an aircraft to crash and sentenced them to life in prison.</p>

<p>The three refused to take part in the legal proceedings or acknowledge their roles in the incident.</p>

<p>Pulatov was acquitted.</p>

<p>Russia dismissed the court verdict as politically motivated.</p>

<p>In January 2024, Girkin was jailed for four years in Russia for repeatedly criticising the Kremlin for not pursuing a more aggressive offensive in Ukraine.</p>

<p>In 2023, the MH17 crash investigators suspended their work, saying there was not enough evidence to prosecute more suspects.</p>

<h3><strong>Has justice been served?&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>An investigation against Russia is still ongoing at the International Civil Aviation Organization, a UN agency.</p>

<p>The Netherlands and Ukraine have also jointly taken a case against Russia at the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.</p>

<p>In the Netherlands, however, hope is fading that any of those responsible will ever be brought to justice.</p>

<p>"In the end, we were unable to put anyone behind bars," Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof told public broadcaster NOS on the eve of the tenth anniversary of the disaster.</p>

<p>"That sense of justice is there, but ultimately not as it should have been," he added.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>American singer Ingrid Andress has revealed that she was "drunk" when she performed the national anthem at the Major League Baseball's (MLB) Home Run Derby and is seeking treatment now.</p>

<p>In a post on X, Andress, 32, addressed her out-of-tune performance of the 'Star-Spangled Banner' at the Globe Life Field in Texas' Arlington on Monday evening and announced that she would check into a rehab facility for required help.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>"I'm not gonna bulls*** y'll, I was drunk last night. I'm checking myself into a facility today to get the help I need," she wrote. Andress later apologised to her fans and the MLB for the same.</p>

<p>"I apologize to MLB, all the fans, and this country for that rendition. I'll let y'all know how rehab is. I hear it's super fun," she added.</p>

<p>Soon after Andress' performance, social media was abuzz with criticism.</p>

<p>Many speculated the singer struggled with more than just the in-ear issues on stage. Her performance, according to reports, started off-key and even strained for high notes.</p>

<p>Several termed it among the worst national anthem performances ever heard during a major professional sporting event, The Guardian reported.</p>

<p>Some social media users compared it to Fergie's rendition before the 2018 NBA All-Star game.</p>

<h2><strong>Who is Ingrid Andress?</strong></h2>

<p>Andress came into the limelight after her appearance in the second season of The Sing-Off as a part of the Pitch Slapped group in 2010. While the group got eliminated early, Andress returned to the show as part of another group, Delilah, in the next season.</p>

<p>In 2020, she debuted her first album, Lady Like, which topped the Billboard's Emerging Artists chart.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Astronauts often report that the joy of eating is lost in space. Food that tastes fabulous on Earth may become <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0899900702009358?via%3Dihub">bland and boring in orbit</a>.</p>

<p>In fact, despite carefully designed diets, space travellers often <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/human-adaptation-2021-final.pdf">struggle to eat enough to meet their energy needs</a>.</p>

<p>What's going on here? We carried out some experiments on Earth to find out, using virtual reality (VR) and a simulated spacecraft environment to study how space travel might affect a person's sense of smell and experience of food.</p>

<p>We discovered that some smells seem much more intense in a space-like environment – and earlier theories about how zero gravity affects the body can't be the whole story. Our results, <a href="https://ifst.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ijfs.17306">published</a> in the International Journal of Food Science and Technology, could help design the space menus of the future.</p>

<h2>Eating is a complicated experience</h2>

<p>Eating is a multi-sensory experience that involves sight, smell, taste, hearing, and touch.</p>

<p>To enjoy the flavour of food – say, when biting into an apple – we need a combination of sensations, including taste (sweet, sour), smell (the complex combination of apple aromas), texture (the crunch), colour (green, red), and touch (firmness). If any of these senses is dulled, our enjoyment of food will not be the same.</p>

<p>The experience of food in space is very different from what we are used to on Earth.</p>

<p>One possible explanation for why space travellers experience taste differently involves the lack of gravity. Without gravity, bodily fluids are not drawn towards the feet but instead <a href="https://ift.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2621.2002.tb10622.x">shift towards the head</a>, leading to a sensation <a href="https://ift.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1541-4337.12633">like having a blocked nose</a>. If you've ever had a cold, you know how difficult it is to taste and enjoy food without your sense of smell.</p>

<p>But could there be other reasons?</p>

<h2>The importance of environment</h2>

<p>In space, the environment is unfamiliar and consistently monotonous. Could this change our perception of food?</p>

<p>Context heavily contributes to the eating experience. Studies have shown that eating the same meal in <a href="https://www.infona.pl/resource/bwmeta1.element.elsevier-82188b09-5e0d-341c-a5c2-826baefddca6">different settings</a> can lead to <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0950329302001891">varying opinions</a> about the meal. Think about enjoying a picnic sandwich in a scenic park versus eating the same sandwich quickly at your work desk.</p>

<p>A spacecraft is an enclosed and confined environment, an airtight container in which you are surrounded by wiring and equipment and with no boundary between work and personal space. Imagine being in a pandemic-grade lockdown for multiple years with limited food and essential goods (and a persistent blocked nose).</p>

<p>One <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/joss.12254">taste-test study</a> compared airline meals consumed in three settings: a classic sensory laboratory environment (quiet, closed or semi-closed cubicles – like a voting booth), a semi-realistic aircraft environment simulated in a laboratory using aircraft furnishings, and an actual flight.</p>

<p>Passengers in the simulated aircraft environment enjoyed their meals about as much as passengers on an actual flight did. (Both of them liked it less than the people in the lab environment did.) This suggests the aircraft environment has a significant influence on food enjoyment.</p>

<h2>Bringing space to Earth</h2>

<p>Research involving humans in space is very challenging. Space missions typically involve at most <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/international-space-station/space-station-facts-and-figures/">six or seven crew members</a>, which limits the sample size for experiments and the predictive power of the results.</p>

<p>Moreover, for food research, each person has <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S221479931500048X">unique sensory experiences</a> and responses toward them. This makes it challenging to understand how different individuals perceive smells in space, let alone food aromas.</p>

<p>So we set out to recreate space on Earth. Using VR, we simulated the environment of the International Space Station.</p>

<p>The VR setup let us obtain data about participants' feelings regarding food stimuli “in the moment”, rather than waiting for them to take off the headset and asking them questions afterwards. VR is a vital training environment for astronauts because of its unmatched ability to create a realistic sense of presence, crucial for studying what it is like to live in a spacecraft.</p>

<figcaption><span class="caption">Participants smelled different scents while immersed in a VR space station environment.</span> <span class="attribution"><span class="source">Seamus Daniel / RMIT University</span></span></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Our study is the first to involve a significant sample size (54 people) to capture the variation of individuals' personal experiences of aromas and taste in simulated isolated settings.</p>

<p>In our study comparing everyday aromas, some scents were perceived differently in the virtual International Space Station environment compared to the partitioned booth environment.</p>

<h2>Molecular magic of aroma</h2>

<p>Aromas are <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/chemistry/articles/10.3389/fchem.2022.820749/full">a complex blend of molecules</a> with unique chemical structures, influencing how they interact with the olfactory receptors in the nose to form distinctive smells.</p>

<p>Our study suggests that only specific aroma compounds are perceived differently in space-like environments. We found that sweet-smelling molecules tended to be perceived more strongly.</p>

<p>Vanilla and almond, which both contain the sweet, <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jafc.8b05845">almond- or cherry-scented</a> compound benzaldehyde, smelled stronger in our VR space station than in the control environment. By contrast, there was no difference in perception of the lemon aroma.</p>

<p>This knowledge could be used in designing space meals. For example, the sweet aromas could be used as flavour enhancers or additives to bring out other flavours and add depth.</p>

<p>Understanding how these aroma compounds interact with each other, and finding the right concentration levels is essential. And of course, no single flavour will suit everybody's taste.</p>

<h2>Earthly implications</h2>

<p>A better understanding of how smell is perceived in space-like environments could inspire ways to create personalised diets based on each astronaut's unique sensory experiences and preferences. By tailoring food aromas, we could encourage space travellers not only to eat more, but enjoy food more.</p>

<p>These solutions may also help people on Earth living in isolated or confined environments, such as nursing home residents, individuals on military deployment, and submarine crews.<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.

<p>What do actors Amitabh Bachchan, Anushka Sharma and Shilpa Shetty, cricketer Sachin Tendulkar, National Stock Exchange (NSE) MD and CEO Ashishkumar Chauhan, and Indian industrialists Ratan Tata and Mukesh Ambani have in common? They've all been targets of deepfake videos that used their personas to peddle weight loss drugs and medication for diabetes, and promote fraudulent money-making schemes on social media.</p>

<p>Rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have ushered in a new era of technological disruption, with deepfakes emerging as a particularly concerning challenge for India's information integrity and public discourse.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Political Misinformation</strong></h2>

<p>In the buildup to the recent Lok Sabha elections, significant numbers of people in India had already been targeted by audio and audio-visual deepfakes, although these were mainly attempts to scam them in various ways. Around the Lok Sabha elections, there were also initial fears that political deepfakes could be used to try to influence voters.</p>

<p>These fears were only justified when the election campaign got underway. Fake clips showing Bollywood actors Aamir Khan and Ranveer Singh criticising Prime Minister Narendra Modi were circulated widely. However, ultimately, it may be said that while there were instances of deepfakes being used for mudslinging, targeted political attacks and even spreading misinformation about exit polls, parties used technology largely for their own voter outreach and engagement and to overcome language barriers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Deepfakes were also used by parties to 'resurrect' their dead leaders to enhance the emotional connection with voters. In Tamil Nadu, an AI-generated voice message from former chief minister J. Jayalalithaa, who died in 2016, was circulated to criticise the current governing party, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK). The DMK in turn used AI-generated videos of their own deceased leader, M. Karunanidhi, to praise his son and current chief minister, M.K. Stalin.</p>

<h2><strong>Cheapfakes vs Deepfakes</strong></h2>

<p>While the risk posed by AI-generated content during the elections wasn't as deep as expected, even edited videos were often misattributed as AI-generated or "deepfake" content. For instance, an edited video of Union Home Minister Amit Shah that was circulated before the polls falsely claimed that he promised to scrap reservations for Scheduled Castes (SC), Scheduled Tribes (ST), and Other Backward Classes (OBC) if elected. While the clip was edited using simple video editing tools, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and several mainstream media organisations mislabelled it as a "deepfake".</p>

<p>It is important to remember that deepfakes are AI-generated media created using machine learning algorithms that can map one person's face onto another's body, and even alter their speech. Creating such media requires significant computational power. In contrast, 'cheapfakes' are manipulated media created using relatively simple editing tools. They are less sophisticated than deepfakes but can still effectively spread misinformation. They continue to be used widely in India.</p>

<h2><strong>What India Should Do</strong></h2>

<p>From detection algorithms for deepfakes to media literacy for cheapfakes, India can and should develop more targeted countermeasures for the various kinds of manipulated media.</p>

<p>The creation of deepfakes, which was once a complex and time-consuming process, has increasingly become very accessible. The turnaround time has reduced from days to minutes, even seconds.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Such rapid evolution in technology poses a significant challenge for fact-checkers and content moderators, who struggle to keep up with the pace of misinformation. Fact-checkers in India have found it an uphill battle to debunk deepfake content when it is spread at speed and scale or during heightened activity, such as election seasons. The disparity in the speed of information dissemination underscores the urgent need for more efficient and streamlined verification processes. A multifaceted approach is required to safeguard the integrity of its democratic processes. This approach must encompass technological advancements, regulatory frameworks, and a shift in societal mindsets.</p>

<h2><strong>The Way Ahead</strong></h2>

<p>While deepfakes have become increasingly difficult to detect, developing AI-powered tools to identify and counter such manipulated content holds promise. Tech giants like Google, Meta, and OpenAI have pledged to work closely with the Indian government and voters to protect access to truthful information. However, the effectiveness of the currently proposed measures, such as labelling and watermarking, remains to be seen.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Continued innovation and collaboration in this domain is paramount. By leveraging AI-powered tools, fact-checkers and content moderators can expedite the time it takes to discover false claims, pre-empt them before they cause harm and, in time, even automate deepfake detection, freeing up valuable human resources to focus on more nuanced and contextual analysis. This shift in mindset, from viewing AI as the ultimate verifier to understanding its role in supporting human verification, can lead to more efficient and effective strategies for combating deepfake-driven misinformation.</p>

<p>The Deepfakes Analysis Unit (DAU) initiative, a first-of-its-kind collaboration of academics, researchers, startups, tech platforms, and fact-checkers, is an example of notable efforts in this area.</p>

<p>Fostering a media-literate population is also crucial to counter deepfakes. Educating the public about the risks and the need to verify information can empower them to navigate digital content with scepticism and resilience.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Learning From Others</strong></h2>

<p>Meanwhile, the Indian government's initial reluctance to regulate AI seems to be ebbing as technology's potential for misuse becomes clearer. Recently, following a controversy over Google's Gemini chatbot, the government issued an advisory that reminded intermediaries to take action against AI-generated content that violates the provisions of the Information Technology (IT) Rules, which includes the spread of patently false or untrue information. The advisory also states that where software allows for the creation of deepfakes, it should also label or embed the content with unique identifying data that can be used to determine how the content was created, and by which user.</p>

<p>The deepfake challenge is not unique to India; it is a global phenomenon that requires a coordinated international response. The European Union will seek to regulate high-risk AI systems through its Artificial Intelligence Act. The UK, too, has tasked its regulators with developing rules for various sectors and use-cases. The US Department of Commerce may also issue guidance on labelling and watermarking deep fakes and develop standards for red-teaming AI models, which can have multiple uses.</p>

<p>India ought to develop a unique framework that suits its information environment. This can not only effectively counter the use of harmful deepfakes but also protect free speech and useful innovation (like developing generative AI tools that can help address language barriers).</p>

<h2><strong>Don't Drop the Guard</strong></h2>

<p>As many as 86% of Indians who were surveyed recently said that they believe misinformation and deepfakes will impact future elections and that candidates should be stopped from using generative AI in their promotional content. While the risk has not become as pronounced for now, the steady proliferation of deepfake videos of celebrities, industrialists, and news anchors promoting false medical and financial solutions shows the technology's potential for perpetuating financial fraud. Amid this, the exploitation of ordinary citizens remains a primary concern.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
To navigate this challenge, India must embrace AI's potential to streamline the verification process. By learning from global best practices, India can safeguard the democratic foundations of its elections and empower its citizens to navigate the digital landscape with confidence.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US Secret Service is facing intense scrutiny after a shooter opened fire on former President Donald Trump at a campaign rally, and questions have emerged about why no sniper team was positioned on the building from which the shots were fired. Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle has attributed the absence of a sniper team to the "sloped roof" of the building, citing safety concerns.</p>

<p>In an interview with <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/trump-rally-shooting-unacceptable-secret-service-director-abc-exclusive/story?id=111962314">ABC News</a>, Cheatle explained, "That building in particular has a sloped roof at its highest point. And so, you know, there's a safety factor that would be considered there that we wouldn't want to put somebody up on a sloped roof. The decision was made to secure the building from inside."</p>

<p>The shooter, Thomas Matthew Crooks, had a clear line of sight of Trump from the roof, which was approximately 130 yards away. Using an AR-style semi-automatic rifle, Crooks opened fire, injuring Trump and two others, and killing firefighter Corey Comperatore. Secret Service snipers ultimately killed Crooks.</p>

<p>Despite acknowledging the agency's missteps, Cheatle refused to step down, stating, "It was unacceptable, and it's something that shouldn't happen again. The buck stops with me."</p>

<p>The incident has spurred a wave of criticism toward the Secret Service for failing to fulfil its "no fail" responsibility of protecting high-profile figures. President Joe Biden announced an independent review of the agency's handling of the shooting in Butler, Pennsylvania, and Republican leaders in Congress have also called for an investigation.</p>

<p>Key questions remain about the safety roles at the rally and why the roof used by Crooks was not secured. Cheatle noted that the building where the shooter was located was in the "outer perimeter" of the rally, which was the responsibility of local police. "There was local police in that building -- there was local police in the area that were responsible for the outer perimeter of the building," she said, though she did not clarify how the shooter was able to access the roof.</p>

<p>The attack has prompted the Secret Service to vow full cooperation with the independent review. Cheatle stated, "The Secret Service is working with all involved federal, state, and local agencies to understand what happened, how it happened, and how we can prevent an incident like this from ever taking place again. We understand the importance of the independent review announced by President Biden yesterday and will participate fully."</p>

<p>The rally, held in Butler, Pennsylvania, was interrupted when multiple gunshots rang out. Trump, visibly injured with blood on his ear and cheek, was swiftly surrounded by Secret Service agents and rushed to safety. The shooter and a bystander were killed, and two spectators were injured.</p>

<p>Newly surfaced video supports witness reports that they had alerted police to the shooter on the roof. According to the Washington Post, shots targeting Trump were fired 86 seconds after the first attempts to warn the police.</p>

<p>In response to the incident, Biden has ordered a comprehensive review of security at the rally and at the upcoming Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, where Trump is expected to be the party's presidential nominee. Additionally, Secret Service protection has been extended to independent candidate Robert F Kennedy Jr, whose candidacy could impact key swing states.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Six people have been discovered dead in a suite of a Bangkok hotel, sparking a wave of confusion and speculation across the city. Initially reported as a shooting, authorities have since debunked these claims, focusing instead on a harrowing possibility: poisoning.</p>

<p>The victims, all Vietnamese nationals, including two with dual US citizenship, were found in a room at the Grand Hyatt Erawan hotel.</p>

<p>The cleaning staff discovered the bodies at 4.30 pm on the fifth floor of the hotel. Police were called, and PM Thavisin arrived soon after. "There were no signs of a struggle," the prime minister told a press conference at the hotel.</p>

<p>Thai police, in a subsequent press conference, revealed that preliminary investigations indicated no signs of physical altercation or robbery. Instead, suspicions turned towards a lethal ingestion of a toxic substance, possibly cyanide.</p>

<p>"One of the six dead caused this incident using cyanide," said Noppasil Poonsawas, deputy commander of investigations at Bangkok's Metropolitan Police Bureau, in a press conference. "We are confident that one of the six conducted the crime."</p>

<p>But photos released by police of a bloodless crime scene showed plates of untouched Thai food, and two thermos flasks of coffee and cups.</p>

<p>The police chief said they needed to find out why this happened, adding it was a "killing", not a suicide.</p>

<p>The motive behind this tragic incident remains unclear as authorities delve deeper into the backgrounds of the deceased. Some of the victims were visiting Thailand for the first time, while others were familiar with the country's attractions.</p>

<p>The area where the incident occurred is popular with tourists and has many shopping malls and attractions. There was a shooting in the area last year in which three people were killed. Thailand's tourism industry has been recovering slowly from the pandemic, with 28 million visitors in 2023, up from 11 million the previous year.</p>

<p>The government hopes to attract 35 million visitors in 2024 and generate $55 billion in revenue.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a warehouse in the lush humid farmlands of central Thailand, thousands of pythons lie coiled in containers, rearing and striking at the glass as people pass by.</p>

<p>They are being raised for their robust, diamond-patterned skins, which are sold to high-end European fashion houses for belts, bags and handbags, but some scientists and industry insiders believe the snakes' true value could lie in their meat.</p>

<p>Demand for meat is growing globally, despite the carbon footprint associated with traditional livestock, and while a plant-based diet is often touted as the best alternative, some feel reptiles have been overlooked as an option.</p>

<p>Snakes can tolerate high temperatures and drought, reproduce quickly, and grow far faster than traditional sources of animal protein while consuming a lot less food.</p>

<p>Researchers estimate that China and Vietnam alone have at least 4,000 python farms, producing several million snakes, mostly for the fashion industry.</p>

<p>"Python farming may offer a flexible and efficient response to global food insecurity," concluded a study published earlier this year in the journal Nature.</p>

<p>The researchers spent a year studying nearly 5,000 reticulated Burmese pythons at two commercial farms in Vietnam and Thailand.</p>

<p>"They can survive for months on end with no food at all and no water, and literally they won't lose condition at all," said Patrick Aust, director of the African Institute of Applied Herpetology and one of the scientists involved in the study.</p>

<p>The pythons were fed waste chicken and wild-caught rodents and offered a more efficient feed-to-meat ratio than poultry, beef and even crickets.</p>

<p>They also reproduce rapidly, Aust said, with female pythons laying between 50 and 100 eggs annually.</p>

<h3><strong>'Complete waste'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>That is music to the ears of Emilio Malucchi, whose farm in central Thailand's Uttaradit houses around 9,000 pythons.</p>

<p>Malucchi, who moved to Thailand from Italy with his family more than four decades ago, has had little success convincing people to take up snake meat, and most of what he produces is either discarded or goes to fish farms.</p>

<p>"It's a complete waste," he told AFP.</p>

<p>"I eat my snakes because I know what they eat and how I raise them," he said.</p>

<p>Wild python has long been eaten throughout Southeast Asia, but the meat has yet to attract widespread international interest despite offering a chicken-like texture low in saturated fats.</p>

<p>"The problem is that there is no market for python flesh. We need to educate people about its possibilities," said Malucchi.</p>

<p>The climate impact of meat has been extensively documented, with the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change noting that meat from grazing animals -- mainly beef -- has been "consistently identified as the single food with the greatest impact on the environment."</p>

<p>That effect is both in terms of greenhouse emissions and land use change.</p>

<p>While the UN and climate activists advocate moving to a more plant-based diet, the OECD estimates demand for meat will increase 14 per cent by 2032, driven by population growth in low-income regions and rising living standards in Asian countries.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, drought and extreme weather are making traditional farming increasingly difficult in many parts of the world where the need for protein is urgent.</p>

<p>Protein-energy malnutrition, sometimes called protein-energy undernutrition, caused nearly 190,000 deaths globally in 2021, according to the Global Burden of Disease study.</p>

<h3><strong>'Nice and crispy'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>That paradox has spurred a push to explore meat alternatives, from edible insects to lab-grown meats.</p>

<p>But uptake of these alternatives has not yet been significant and commercial python farmers face strict processing standards that the industry complains are outdated.</p>

<p>Despite these challenges, Aust believes python farming has "huge potential" and is enthusiastic about its merits.</p>

<p>"You can barbecue it or eat it in curries and stews. I like to fry it in garlic butter until it's nice and crispy," he said.</p>

<p>"It's a very versatile meat."</p>

<p>Animal welfare organisations are less impressed.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, animal rights group PETA accused Malucchi's farm of cruelty after secretly documenting his pythons being killed with hammers before being skinned.</p>

<p>Malucchi has placed large posters on his walls on how to kill pythons "humanely" and said his industry is no different from other types of livestock farming.</p>

<p>"Farm animals are slaughtered all over the world," he said.</p>

<p>"Pythons are no different."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Donald Trump called JD Vance on Monday to offer him the vice presidential post just 20 minutes before making the announcement. ]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p>

<p>Former US President Donald Trump has picked JD Vance, a Republican senator, as his running mate for the 2024 presidential election. On his Truth Social platform, Trump said that after lengthy deliberation and thought, and "considering the tremendous talents of many others", he decided Vance was best suited to assume the position of Vice President of the United States.</p>

<p>According to a source, the Republican nominee called the Ohio senator on Monday to offer him the vice presidential post just 20 minutes before making the announcement. The two met at Trump's Mar-a-Lago club on Saturday before the rally where Trump was shot at.</p>

<p>Vance and Trump share similar views on issues such as immigration and trade.</p>

<h2><strong>Why Trump chose JD Vance</strong></h2>

<p>Donald Trump, recently, spent months evaluating potential running mates, observing how they performed on TV, at fundraisers and rallies. Some contenders accompanied him to his criminal trial in New York, while others joined him at the debate last month. The debate was known for President Joe Biden's poor performance, which led to calls for him to step down and let a younger candidate take his place.</p>

<p>Trump's choice of JD Vance as his running mate is a strategic move to energise his loyal base. Vance has established himself as a leader who can carry Trump's mantle into the future, thanks to his frequent appearances on the conservative media circuit and his willingness to spar with reporters on Capitol Hill.</p>

<p>In his announcement post, Trump praised Vance for his dedication to American workers and farmers, saying he "will be strongly focused on the people he fought so brilliantly for" in Midwestern states such as Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Ohio, and Minnesota, as per AP.</p>

<p>Vance and Trump also regularly talk over the phone.</p>

<p>The former president has even complimented the senator's looks, comparing him to a young Abraham Lincoln.</p>

<p>Vance was once a vocal critic of Donald Trump, labelling him "a total fraud," an "idiot", "a moral disaster", and even "America's Hitler."</p>

<p>However, as Trump's political fortunes soared, Vance's perspective shifted dramatically. Despite his early scepticism, Vance later praised Trump's presidency, crediting him with "delivering peace and prosperity."</p>

<p>This change in stance led to Trump endorsing him during his 2022 Senate bid.</p>

<p>Now a steadfast Trump loyalist, Vance has actively defended him against criminal and civil charges and questioned the 2020 election results.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sikh Republican Harmeet Dhillon delivered a prayer at the Republican National Convention (RNC) on Monday.&nbsp;Ms Dhillon, a religious-liberty lawyer and former Donald Trump campaign adviser, told the Milwaukee audience that she comes from a family of Sikh immigrants. She shared a prayer from her faith tradition, which translates to, "This body and soul are yours. You are our mother and father, and we are your children. In your grace and through your benevolence, we experience peace and happiness!"&nbsp;<br />
<br />
She then thanked God for protecting Donald Trump, who was shot at on Sunday at a Pennsylvania rally. She said, “We thank you, dear God, for protecting his life.”<br />
<br />
However, some conservative Christians on X criticised Ms Dhillon's prayer, saying it was "unacceptable" and that she was praying to a "foreign god."&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">ABSOLUTELY UNACCEPTABLE!!

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Ms Dhillon responded by tweeting that she was "blocking quite a few people", and that the majority of the response to her prayer had been positive.&nbsp;</p>

<br />
She considers herself an ally to people of all religions in the US. She believes that Sikhs, Jews, and Christians all pray to the same God. She stated, “We believe that there is one God.”<br />
<br />
As a lawyer, Ms Dhillon has advocated for the religious rights of all Americans. She has defended Sikhs against discrimination and supported doctors and pharmacists who refuse to perform abortions due to their religious beliefs. Ms Dhillon credits her Sikh faith for inspiring her advocacy work. She says, "My faith teaches me to give back to my community and to be humble."</p>]]></content:encoded>

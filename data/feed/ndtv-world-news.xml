       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to slap a 25% tariff on all goods imported from America's largest trading partners - Mexico and Canada, starting January 20, his first day in office.</p>

<p>But this tariff imposition is also set to have severe implications on his own countrymen, who may face higher prices on various goods.</p>

<p>His first term was marked by a significant trade war with China, aimed at boosting US manufacturing, securing national security interests, and addressing what Trump believed was an extremely imbalanced trade relationship.</p>

<p>President Joe Biden maintained most of these tariffs and even added new ones.</p>

<p>But the new tariffs come at a time when the US has grown increasingly reliant on imports from Mexico and Canada. Mexico has overtaken China as the top exporter of goods to the US, while Canada is a close third. This means that the new tariffs will be virtually inescapable for Americans, as businesses facing higher costs will likely pass them on to consumers.</p>

<p>This potential trade war could break banks. Here are a few items that could get more expensive if Trump decides to follow through with his tariff plan.</p>

<h2>Gas</h2>

<p>The US imports a significant amount of crude oil from Canada, which is refined to produce gasoline and heating oil. A 25% tariff could lead to an increase of 25-75 cents per gallon, impacting Americans in the Great Lakes, Midwest, and Rockies regions.</p>

<p>After Canada' expansion of the Trans Mountain pipeline, the oil imports to the US had reached a whopping 4.3 million barrels per day.</p>

<p>"You can't simply process different oil overnight. It would take investments/years. More US supply wouldn't help," Patrick De Haan, the head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy said on X.</p>

<h3>Produce</h3>

<p>As a byproduct of climate change, the US has become less favourable for agriculture and relies heavily on Mexico.&nbsp;</p>

<p>$44.1 billion worth of agricultural products were imported by the US from Mexico in 2022.</p>

<p>90% of avocados Americans also consumed in 2022 were imported. A 25% tariff could make guacamole and avocado toast more expensive.</p>

<h3>Cars</h3>

<p>Mexico is a major hub for car manufacturing, with many US carmakers relying on parts from Mexico to build their vehicles. A 25% tariff could disrupt this supply chain and lead to higher car prices.</p>

<p>Last year, $44.76 billion worth of vehicles were imported from Mexico to the US.</p>

<h3>Alcohol</h3>

<p>According to US Department of Agriculture data, 80% of beer imports come from Mexico. Moreover there is tequila that comes from Mexico and other liqueurs from Canada that drives import growth.</p>

<p>In 2023, $4.6 billion worth of tequila and $108 million worth of mezcal was imported by the US from Mexico, according to the Distilled Spirits Council.</p>

<p>The tariffs of spirits are bound to start a chain reaction leading to job losses in the hospitality industry as well, which are still on their way to recovery after the pandemic.</p>

<p>The tariffs on these imports are bound to hurt the consumers if businesses face higher costs. Trump's tariff plan has already sparked concerns among businesses and economists, who warn that it could lead to higher prices, job losses, and a decline in economic growth.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tan Sri Ananda Krishnan is one of Malaysia's most influential and wealthiest individuals. In the past few days, Mr Krishnan, also known as AK, has been in the limelight because of his son Ajahn Siripanyo, who gave up the world's riches and spoils to become a Buddhist monk. According to <em>Forbes</em>, the 86-year-old is Malaysia's third richest man, with a net worth of over $5 billion (approximately Rs 40,000 crore). His business empire spans multiple industries, from telecommunications to multimedia.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Who is Tan Sri Ananda Krishnan?&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Ananda Krishnan is a Malaysian businessman and philanthropist. According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/ananda-krishnan/" rel="noindex,nofollow"><em>Forbes</em></a>, his business empire spans across telecom, satellites, oil, gas and real estate industries. He also owns Aircel, the now-bankrupt phone company that once sponsored Indian Premier League (IPL) team Chennai Super Kings.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ananda Krishnan is a Harvard Business School graduate. Born into Malaysia's middle-class family, he is known for his philanthropic favour. In 1985 he helped the Luve Air rock concert project that raised some $240 million around the world for African famine relief. Since then, he has donated tens of millions to art, education, sports and humanitarian causes in Malaysia through his privately owned holding company, Usaha Tegas, and its three main listed subsidiaries: cell phone operator Maxis, satellite TV and entertainment company Astro All Asia Networks and Tanjong, which is active in gaming, power generation and property.</p>

<p>Despite his immense wealth and business success, Mr Krishnan has remained a relatively private figure. However, his philanthropic efforts are well-known. His journey from modest beginnings to becoming one of Malaysia's richest businessmen serves as an inspiration for aspiring entrepreneurs.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>About&nbsp;Ananda Krishnan's monk son</strong></h3>

<p>Ananda Krishnan has only one son, who denounced a fortune worth billions to become a monk in Thailand. <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/meet-ajahn-siripanyo-the-monk-who-gave-up-his-fathers-5-billion-empire-7111250">Ajahn Siripanyo</a> chose to detach himself from worldly possessions at the age of 18, a decision his father respects as he himself is a devout Buddhist.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ajahn Siripanyo is also reportedly a blue-blooded noble. His mother, Momwajarongse Suprinda Chakraban, is a descendant of the Thai royal family, according to the <em>South China Morning Post</em> report. Currently, he resides at the Dtao Dum Monastery located somewhere on the Thailand-Myanmar border as an abbot.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The video was inundated withhateful and objectifying comments, prompting Blue Origin to take it down to shield her from further online harassment.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Blue Origin was forced to delete a video of female astronaut Emily Calandrelli's first time in space due to a flood of sexist and misogynistic comments on social media. Ms Calandrelli, an MIT engineer and TV host, was part of Blue Origin's NS-28 mission and became the 100th woman to fly to space. The footage, shared after her flight on November 22 captured her emotional reaction to seeing Earth from space. In the video, Ms Calandrelli expressed amazement, likening the experience to the joy of seeing her children for the first time.</p>

<p>"We got to weightlessness, I immediately turned upside down and looked at the planet and then there was so much blackness. There was so much space.&nbsp;I didn't expect to see so much space, and I kept saying that's our planet! That's our planet! It was the same feeling I got when my kids were born, and I was like, That's my baby," she said in the video.</p>

<p>However, the post was inundated with&nbsp;hateful and objectifying comments, prompting Blue Origin to take down the video to shield her from further online harassment. Some sexualized her reaction, while others posted offensive comments targeting her appearance and other personal aspects. One user wrote, "Would you consider yourself the hottest woman to ever go to space? Any other contenders?" Another said, "why is she moaning I cannot unhear it."</p>

<p>Despite the negative attention, Ms Calandrelli stood firm against the backlash and voiced her feelings on her Instagram account.&nbsp; She wrote she refuses "to give much time to the small men on the internet."</p>

<p>"This all happened as I was flying home after experiencing the most perfect, wonderful dream-achieving experience of my life. And instead of being on cloud nine, I'm crying in my seat staring out the window. Because of course, this happened. Of course, I should have expected this," she wrote.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"But I refuse to give much time to the small men on the internet. I feel experiences in my soul. It's a trait I got from my father. We feel every emotion deeply and what a beautiful way that is to experience life. This joy is tattooed on my heart," she added.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bangladesh has called <a class="sp_lnk2" href="http://www.ndtv.com/topic/iskcon" target="_blank">ISKCON</a>, or the International Society for Krishna Consciousness, a "religious fundamentalist" group in an affidavit filed in that country's High Court.&nbsp;The interim government - in power after August's student-led rebellion ousted then Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina - also said it is "examining ISKON.</p>

<p>This follows protests over the arrest Hindu priest Chinmoy Krishna Das Brahmachari on Monday; this was after the Hindu community in the city of Rangpur, which is 300 km north of Dhaka, protested demanding stronger laws to protect them and a minority affairs ministry.</p>

<p>Hindus comprise around eight per cent of Bangladesh's 170 million people.</p>

<p>Since Ms Hasina was forced to quit, the new military-backed interim administration, led by Nobel laureate Mohammed Yunus, has faced criticism for failing to control violence against minorities. This includes instances of Hindu businesses and homes being vandalised.</p>

<p>The reference to ISKON as a "religious fundamentalist" organisation was part of the Bangladesh Attorney General's response to a question about the origin of the group in Bangladesh.</p>

<p>In his response, Mohd. Asaduzzaman reportedly said, "... it is a religious fundamentalist organisation. The government is already scrutinising them", and was told to file a note on authorities' response to ISKON and the prevailing law-and-order situation in the country.</p>

<p>The arrest of Chinmoy Brahmachari has, again, triggered furious and violent protests in Bangladesh; this morning it emerged that a temple in Chattogram had been vandalised.</p>

<p>ISKCON spokesperson Radharamn Das shared a video on X and wrote, "24x7 attack on Hindus &amp; Hindu places of worship in #Bangladesh. When will it all STOP?", while the ISKCON's Bangladesh unit condemned the arrest and the violence against Hindu community members.</p>

<p>The arrest has also led to political frostiness between New Delhi and Dhaka.</p>

<p>Delhi has expressed strong reservations over Chinmoy Brahmachari's arrest and urged Dhaka to ensure the safety of minority communities, including Hindus. The Bangladesh Foreign Ministry, however, has bristled at what they said was India's interference in its "internal affairs".</p>

<p>The Yunus government later reaffirmed "in the strongest terms" that every Bangladeshi, regardless of their religious identity, has the "right to establish, maintain or perform respective religious rituals and practices or express views without hindrance."</p>

<p>Chinmoy Brahmachari's arrest also triggered widespread protests by his supporters, prompting law enforcement agencies to be on alert across that country.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A video of President-elect Donald Trump&nbsp;jokingly offering "millions" to buy a young black girl's hair during a golf outing, has gone viral on social media. While driving a cart while playing golf in West Palm Beach, Florida, Trump complimented a girl on her hair, saying, "Oh, I love that girl. I love that hair. I want her hair. Can I buy your hair? I'll pay you millions for that." &nbsp;She told the 78-year-old that she voted for him, and Trump playfully responded that he voted for her too.</p>

<p>He then invited the child, who he described as beautiful, to join him on his golf cart for a photo opportunity. The crowd was delighted by the moment, with one onlooker expressing amazement and noting that the girl would have a unique story to share - playing golf with the president.</p>

<p><strong>Here's the video:</strong></p>

<p></p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>The video has sparked mixed reactions. While some people appreciated his lighthearted and playful demeanour, others found the exchange to be unusual and weird. Some also called it racist. One user wrote, "This is so creepy and weird. A grown man yells out that he wants to buy a young girl's hair. That's weird, joking or not." Another said, "I can't take another 4 years of this."</p>

<p>Some also thought there was nothing wrong with the exchange.&nbsp;A third commented, "Imagine calling him racist when Trump is complimenting this beautiful young black girl's hair. This is why people love Trump. He's human just like the rest of us and has a heart.''</p>

<p>A fourth added, "Come on! People say that to kids to be nice! People overreacting! If it was someone else you would say that is cute and the girl has nice hair."</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US lumber prices, which already have risen in recent months due to lower production in Canada, could see further gains after President-elect Donald Trump's proposed tariffs on trade from north of the border.</p>

<p>Lumber futures in Chicago rose as much as 2.1% to $599 per 1,000 board feet Tuesday after the president-elect posted on social media that he would&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-25/trump-vows-to-hit-china-mexico-canada-with-tariffs-over-border" rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">impose</a>&nbsp;25% tariffs on all goods from Canada and Mexico unless those countries curb the flow of fentanyl and migrants into the US. Shares of forestry companies, including West Fraser Timber Co. and Interfor Corp., fell.</p>

<p>Canada, the biggest foreign supplier of lumber to the US, has faced a spate of sawmill closures amid higher US duties. The addition of tariffs would further threaten US lumber supplies as the nation seeks to rebuild in areas hit by hurricanes.</p>

<p>“What we've seen is that any of these sorts of duties or tariffs, they just end up causing supply to go down and prices to go up, and that impacts affordability of housing,” said Kurt Niquidet, chief economist of the BC Council of Forest Industries.&nbsp;</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-11/f3f03i6g_trump-tariffs_625x300_27_November_24.jpg?im=FitAndFill,algorithm=dnn,width=1200,height=738" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>The implementation of tariffs is more uncertain than duties, which are reassessed annually, but both would delve a financial blow to Canadian producers, Niquidet said.</p>

<p>In the US, tariffs “will further exacerbate our nation's ongoing housing affordability crisis,” Jim Tobin, president of the National Association of Home Builders, said in an emailed statement. The association had already been expecting price spikes over the next year as housing demand increases, he said.</p>

<p>While the US has become increasingly self-sufficient in its lumber production, it still relies on imports from Canada to meet domestic demand. And forests in the US South, the continent's biggest lumber production region, faced losses during the recent hurricane season.</p>

<p>Hurricane Helene in September damaged&nbsp;<a href="https://gatrees.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Hurricane-Helene-Timber-Impact-Assessment-Georgia-2024.pdf" rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">roughly 6%</a>&nbsp;of Georgia's forests, equating to about 1.47 million acres and $1.28 billion in losses, according to the Georgia Forestry Commission.&nbsp;</p>

</div>

<p>After hurricanes Helene and Milton, housing construction in the South&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-19/us-housing-starts-slide-3-1-as-hurricanes-impact-south-region" rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">dropped</a>&nbsp;in October as builders postponed projects, though single-family permit authorizations — a sign of future construction — rose to the fastest pace since April.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Rebuilding efforts in hurricane-affected areas are “slowly gaining momentum” and should support strong lumber sales in late December and early next year, said Crystal Gauvin, a senior economist at Forest Economic Advisors.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump's granddaughter, Kai, has offered a rare glimpse inside the US President-elect's private jet, Force One. In her latest YouTube vlog, the 17-year-old documented how she travelled to witness a SpaceX rocket launch alongside Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Ms Kai gave an intimate tour of the luxurious jet, featuring plush sofas, high-tech TVs, and a sleek, modern interior.</p>

<p>“Come along with me to SpaceX with Elon Musk for the sixth flight test of Starship!” she wrote to introduce the vlog. Next, she's seen boarding the plush aircraft alongside her friend.</p>

<p>Donald Trump's private jet, a Boeing 757, stands out for its customised interiors. Often referred to as the "Trump Force One," it has played a significant role in his campaigns and public image.</p>

<p>The Force One has seats embroidered with gold threads, lavatory fixtures, and other fittings. It also has plush leather seating and high-end wooden furnishings along with a state-of-the-art entertainment system with multiple screens.</p>

<p>There is a bedroom with a double bed and a dining area which seats four.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ms Kai also gave us a behind-the-scenes look at the cockpit. We also see a bobblehead at the centre. She recreated her grandfather's iconic YMCA dance moves and mimicked his well-known golf swing and signature hand gestures. Her enthusiasm continued as she explored the cockpit, describing the experience of seeing a plane land as "pretty cool stuff."</p>

<p>The vlog didn't just end on the jet. Ms Kai documented her journey to the SpaceX facility, capturing moments of her grandfather's conversation with Elon Musk about the rocket launch.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“I asked grandpa, ‘Would you go in it?',” said Ms Kai in the video. “And he goes, ‘No'. He would not volunteer to go in the spaceship but it's OK.”</p>

<p>Ms Kai laughed and then asked her friend if she would go. “Go on it? Without a doubt. In a heartbeat, I'm on that,” her friend said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Kai Trump described witnessing the rocket launch as "honestly one of the coolest things ever," despite the booster not returning to the launch pad and instead landing in the Gulf of Mexico. “I've never seen something like that,” she said with awe. “And the noise of it, when it was going up. Insane.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Donald Trump has appointed the SpaceX CEO to lead the newly established Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) alongside Vivek Ramaswamy.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Amid unrest in Bangladesh following the arrest of Hindu priest Chinmoy Krishna Das Brahmachari by Dhaka police, a Hindu temple was allegedly targeted by a mob in Chattogram. The arrest of former ISKCON leader Chinmoy Krishna Das has triggered protests across Bangladesh, with the community calling for the monk's release and justice for Hindus who have faced persecution since the ouster of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Loknath temple in Chittagong's Firingibazar was targeted in Chattogram, according to reports.</p>

<p>International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) spokesperson, Radharamn Das, shared a purported video of a mob attack on the temple on his X account and wrote, "24x7 attack on Hindus &amp; Hindu places of worship in #Bangladesh. When will it all STOP?"&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Dhaka Reacts To India's Statement Over Monk's Arrest</strong></h2>

<p>Dhaka has reacted to India's statement condemning the arrest of Chinmoy Krishna Das Brahmachari and calling Bangladeshi authorities to ensure the safety and security of Hindus and all other minorities. In the issued by Bangladesh's foreign ministry, the Chief Adviser Prof Muhammad Yunus's government called the matter Dhaka's "internal affair" and said India's concerns are "unfounded" adding it "contrary to the spirit of friendship"</p>

<p>The Yunus administration later reaffirmed "in the strongest terms" that every Bangladeshi, regardless of their religious identity, has the "right to establish, maintain or perform respective religious rituals and practices or express views without hindrance."</p>

<h3><strong>Lawyer's Killing And Subsequent Arrests</strong></h3>

<p>The Bangladesh government also expressed "deep concerns" over the brutal killing of Advocate Saiful Islam Alif outside Chattogram court on Tuesday. "Authorities have stepped up security in the port city to ensure that religious harmony is maintained at any cost," read the statement.</p>

<p>Saiful, 35, an assistant public prosecutor, was hacked to death amid clashes between police and a crowd protesting the arrest of ISKCON leader Chinmoy Krishna Das in Bangladesh's port city of Chittagong. "Saiful Islam Alif, a lawyer, was killed in Chittagong," Nazim Uddin Chowdhury, President of Chittagong Bar Association, told news agency ANI over the phone.</p>

<p>Chief Adviser Yunus also condemned the murder of a lawyer and ordered an investigation into the killing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As per Bangladeshi media, law enforcement authorities have detained at least 20 people in raids in Chittagong in connection with the killing of the lawyer. Quoting Kotwali police station Officer-in-Charge Fazlul Kader, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/nation/366390/20-held-in-chittagong-over-lawyer-killing" rel="No Follow, No Index" target="_blank">Dhaka Tribune</a> reported that arrests were made during operations in Patharghata Mathar Potti, Andarkilla and Hazari Goli areas from Tuesday evening until midnight.</p>

<h3><strong>Unrest In Bangladesh</strong></h3>

<p>The law enforcement agencies are on high alert across Bangladesh amid tensions in Chittagong. The government has deployed extra forces in Chittagong and the capital Dhaka.</p>

<p>The unrest started after thousands of people in Chittagong gathered outside court premises demanding the release of Chinmoy Brahmachari. The protesters blocked the prison van after a court rejected his bail prayer and ordered to send him to jail. Police and other law-enforcing agencies fired tear shells and sound grenades to remove them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After two hours of clashes, Chinmoy Brahmachari was landed in jail, witnesses said.</p>

<h3><strong>About Chinmoy Krishna Das</strong></h3>

<p>Chandan Kumar Dhar Prokash alias Chinmoy Krishna Das Brahmachari is a spokesperson of the Sanatan Jagaran Mancha. He also heads an ISKCON-operated religious site named Pundarik Dham in Chittagong.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The monk was detained by the Detective Branch (DB) of the Dhaka Metropolitan Police at Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport on Monday and was arrested later on Sedation charges.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"A case has been filed against Chimnoy in charge of sedition, accusing him of hoisting a flag on the top of a stand of Bangladesh's national flag. But the man who filed the case, now he is not attached to the case. He is now disagreed to continue the case," a minority leader said.</p>

<p>Citing sources in ISKCON Chittagong, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/366367/who-is-chinmoy-krishna-and-why-is-he-being-charged" rel="No Follow, No Index" target="_blank">Dhaka Tribune</a> reported that Chinmoy Krishna hails from the port city's Satkania Upazila. He reportedly earned the nickname 'Shishu Bokta' due to his popularity as a religious preacher from an early age. He served as the Chittagong Divisional Secretary of ISKCON from 2016 to 2022 and has also been the Principal of Pundarik Dham in Hathazari, since 2007.</p>

<h3><strong>Violence Against Minorities In Bangladesh</strong></h3>

<p>Chinmoy Krishna Das's arrest came amid tensions over minority rights in the South Asian country that has seen widespread political violence since former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's ouster. Hindus comprise approximately 8 per cent of Bangladesh's 170 million people. Since the ouster of former PM Sheikh Hasina, the new military-backed interim government led by Mohammed Yunus has faced criticism for failing to curb a spike in violence against minorities.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kaley Cuoco is facing criticism after sharing the "heartbreaking decision" she made to rehome her beloved dog. &nbsp;</p>

<p>On Monday, Cuoco addressed the situation on social media, explaining her reasons for rehoming the pet while announcing the dog's death. &nbsp;</p>

<p>"Most of you know I had [Shirley] for many, many, many years," Cuoco began in a video uploaded to Instagram.</p>

<p>"All of a sudden, you kind of stopped seeing her, and I started to get a lot of questions as to where she was, because it's very unlike me to just stop posting about a dog that I've had since she was 6 weeks old," she continued.</p>

<p>Kaley Cuoco elaborated that her decision to rehome her dog, Shirley, was driven by "intense conflicts" with her fiance Tom Pelphrey's dog, Blue. &nbsp;</p>

<p>"Shirley was very special to me, as you all know," Cuoco shared. "When the love of my life, Tom- a huge dog lover-moved across the country with his beautiful German Shepherd, Blue, things got complicated. Unfortunately, a couple of years ago, Blue and Shirley started getting into major fights." &nbsp;</p>

<p>The <em>Big Bang Theory</em> star revealed that Shirley became "determined to harm" Blue, and the situation only escalated. "I loved her deeply, but I was genuinely afraid. I didn't want something terrible to happen or for someone to get hurt by accident," Cuoco said. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Ultimately, she rehomed Shirley with her pet handler, Tony, and his wife, Angie, who had been helping care for her. "They loved her so, so much, and it was an excruciating decision," she explained. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Cuoco then shared that Shirley recently died from "a very aggressive bone cancer." Through tears, she added, "She was almost 14 years old, which is an incredible life for a dog. I just wanted to share her story and what we had to do." &nbsp;</p>

<p>Following her revelation, Cuoco faced backlash from fans on social media, with many expressing disappointment over her decision to rehome the dog. &nbsp;</p>

<p>A user wrote, "I thought she was an advocate for abandoned dogs?"</p>

<p>Another user commented, "There's not a shot in hell I would give away my dog for any bf. Poor Shirley was never considered family; she was just a disposable animal!"</p>

<p>The third user wrote, "One day he'll be out her life and she's going to regret that she made that choice"</p>

<p>The fourth user asked, "Why didn't the boyfriend give up his dog? Why didn't they put both dogs through a training/ behavioural program?"</p>

<p>"I'm utterly disgusted," the fifth user commented.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Amid unrest in Bangladesh following the arrest of Hindu priest Chinmoy Krishna Das Brahmachari by Dhaka police, Hindu temples are allegedly being targeted by mobs in Chattogram. The arrest of former ISKCON leader Chinmoy Krishna Das has triggered protests across Bangladesh, with the community calling for the monk's release and justice for Hindus who have faced persecution since the ouster of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At least three temples - Lokonath Temple in Firangi Bazar, Mansa Mata Temple, and Kali Mata Temple in Hazari Lane - have been targeted in Chattogram in the past 24 hours, according to a report by <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.news18.com/world/temples-attacked-advocate-killed-as-hindu-monks-arrest-pushes-bangladesh-to-edge-top-points-9135421.html" rel="No Follow, No Index" target="_blank">News18</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) spokesperson, Radharamn Das, shared a purported video of a mob attack on a Hindu temple on his X account and wrote, "24x7 attack on Hindus &amp; Hindu places of worship in #Bangladesh. When will it all STOP?"&nbsp;</p>

<p>ISKCON Bangladesh also issued a statement denouncing the arrest of the Hindu monk and subsequent violence and attacks against Sanatanis in various parts of Bangladesh.

<h2><strong>Dhaka Reacts To India's Statement Over Monk's Arrest</strong></h2>

<p>Dhaka has reacted to India's statement condemning the arrest of Chinmoy Krishna Das Brahmachari and calling Bangladeshi authorities to ensure the safety and security of Hindus and all other minorities. In the issued by Bangladesh's foreign ministry, the Chief Adviser Prof Muhammad Yunus's government called the matter Dhaka's "internal affair" and said India's concerns are "unfounded" adding it "contrary to the spirit of friendship"</p>

<p>The Yunus administration later reaffirmed "in the strongest terms" that every Bangladeshi, regardless of their religious identity, has the "right to establish, maintain or perform respective religious rituals and practices or express views without hindrance."</p>

<p>The Bangladesh government also expressed "deep concerns" over the brutal killing of Advocate Saiful Islam Alif outside Chattogram court on Tuesday. "Authorities have stepped up security in the port city to ensure that religious harmony is maintained at any cost," read the statement.</p>

<p>Saiful, 35, an assistant public prosecutor, was hacked to death amid clashes between police and a crowd protesting the arrest of ISKCON leader Chinmoy Krishna Das in Bangladesh's port city of Chittagong. "Saiful Islam Alif, a lawyer, was killed in Chittagong," Nazim Uddin Chowdhury, President of Chittagong Bar Association, told news agency ANI over the phone.</p>

<p>Chief Adviser Yunus also condemned the murder of a lawyer and ordered an investigation into the killing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As per Bangladeshi media, law enforcement authorities have detained at least 20 people in raids in Chittagong in connection with the killing of the lawyer. Quoting Kotwali police station Officer-in-Charge Fazlul Kader, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/nation/366390/20-held-in-chittagong-over-lawyer-killing" rel="No Follow, No Index" target="_blank">Dhaka Tribune</a> reported that arrests were made during operations in Patharghata Mathar Potti, Andarkilla and Hazari Goli areas from Tuesday evening until midnight.</p>

<h3><strong>Unrest In Bangladesh</strong></h3>

<p>The law enforcement agencies are on high alert across Bangladesh amid tensions in Chittagong. The government has deployed extra forces in Chittagong and the capital Dhaka.</p>

<p>The unrest started after thousands of people in Chittagong gathered outside court premises demanding the release of Chinmoy Brahmachari. The protesters blocked the prison van after a court rejected his bail prayer and ordered to send him to jail. Police and other law-enforcing agencies fired tear shells and sound grenades to remove them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After two hours of clashes, Chinmoy Brahmachari was landed in jail, witnesses said.</p>

<h3><strong>About Chinmoy Krishna Das</strong></h3>

<p>Chandan Kumar Dhar Prokash alias Chinmoy Krishna Das Brahmachari is a spokesperson of the Sanatan Jagaran Mancha. He also heads an ISKCON-operated religious site named Pundarik Dham in Chittagong.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The monk was detained by the Detective Branch (DB) of the Dhaka Metropolitan Police at Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport on Monday and was arrested later on Sedation charges.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"A case has been filed against Chimnoy in charge of sedition, accusing him of hoisting a flag on the top of a stand of Bangladesh's national flag. But the man who filed the case, now he is not attached to the case. He is now disagreed to continue the case," a minority leader said.</p>

<p>Citing sources in ISKCON Chittagong, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/366367/who-is-chinmoy-krishna-and-why-is-he-being-charged" rel="No Follow, No Index" target="_blank">Dhaka Tribune</a> reported that Chinmoy Krishna hails from the port city's Satkania Upazila. He reportedly earned the nickname 'Shishu Bokta' due to his popularity as a religious preacher from an early age. He served as the Chittagong Divisional Secretary of ISKCON from 2016 to 2022 and has also been the Principal of Pundarik Dham in Hathazari, since 2007.</p>

<h3><strong>Violence Against Minorities In Bangladesh</strong></h3>

<p>Chinmoy Krishna Das's arrest came amid tensions over minority rights in the South Asian country that has seen widespread political violence since former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's ouster. Hindus comprise approximately 8 per cent of Bangladesh's 170 million people. Since the ouster of former PM Sheikh Hasina, the new military-backed interim government led by Mohammed Yunus has faced criticism for failing to curb a spike in violence against minorities.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The coming year will put incoming US President Donald Trump's geopolitical strategies to the test, as wars rage in the Middle East and Ukraine and tensions rise in Asia.</p>

<p>Here are some of the big foreign policy hotspots facing him and other world leaders in 2025.</p>

<h2><strong>Middle East</strong></h2>

<p>More than a year on from the Hamas attacks of October 7, 2023, the Middle East risks tipping into regional conflict. Israel is pursuing its deadly retaliatory offensive in Gaza while also battling another armed group, Iran-backed Hezbollah, in Lebanon.</p>

<p>Trump has nominated a staunch pro-Israel politician, Mike Huckabee, as his ambassador to Israel.</p>

<p>Michael Horowitz, an analyst at consultancy Le Beck International, said Trump has pledged to "end wars" but does not look inclined to set conditions for Israel.</p>

<p>"The conflict in Gaza could really enter a state of limbo, with Israel imposing a new military solution that keeps troops inside the Strip and declaring that the conflict has ended -- without even the beginning of a political solution," he told AFP.</p>

<p>Horowitz judged a ceasefire in Lebanon more likely, as Israel has achieved "a lot of its objectives", having bombarded Hezbollah and killed several of its leaders.</p>

<h2><strong>Ukraine</strong></h2>

<p>Ukraine is struggling to fight off the invasion launched by Russia in February 2022. Kyiv is short of soldiers and depends on Western military aid, while Russia is advancing in Ukraine's east and has been bolstered by troops from its ally North Korea.</p>

<p>The Republicans' election victory has raised the prospect of a halt to US military aid to Ukraine after party representatives held up a package for nearly a year.</p>

<p>Moscow is pushing for Kyiv to negotiate a settlement.</p>

<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on November 16 that Kyiv would like to end the war next year through "diplomatic means".</p>

<p>But Russia has demanded Kyiv surrender four regions as a precondition for talks, which Ukraine has rejected.</p>

<p>Trump said during his election campaign that he could end the war "in 24 hours".</p>

<p>His nominee for US national security advisor, Mike Waltz, on November 24 called for negotiations.</p>

<p>"We need to restore deterrence, restore peace, and get ahead of this escalation ladder, rather than responding to it," he said.</p>

<h2><strong>North Korea</strong></h2>

<p>Pyongyang has carried out numerous ballistic missile tests in 2024. Tensions have risen between it and South Korea. The North also has strengthened its ties with Moscow.</p>

<p>The two countries signed a mutual defence treaty in June and North Korea sent 10,000 soldiers to aid Moscow's fight against Ukraine.</p>

<p>"In return, North Korea will seek military technology from Moscow -- everything from drone defence systems to ballistic missiles," said Fyodor Tertiskiy, a senior research fellow with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a US-based think tank.</p>

<p>"These moves signal that we should be prepared for actions from North Korea that we haven't seen before."</p>

<p>Andrew Yeo, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, another US think tank, meanwhile pointed to growing tensions between North and South Korea.</p>

<p>Pyongyang recently blew up roads and railways between the two states and accused the South of sending drones into the North.</p>

<p>If Russia further boosts North Korea militarily, "the United States and its allies in Europe and Asia will need to prepare for a new phase of greater instability and possible escalation in northeast Asia," said Yeo.</p>

<h2><strong>Taiwan, China</strong></h2>

<p>Elsewhere in Asia, Taiwan remains a potential flashpoint for global conflict. China claims the island as part of its territory and has said it would never rule out taking it by force.</p>

<p>The United States is Taiwan's most important backer and biggest supplier of weapons, but like most other countries it does not have official diplomatic relations with the island.</p>

<p>Trump has named China hawk Marco Rubio to be his secretary of state, heralding tensions with Beijing.</p>

<p>Waltz meanwhile has declared that the United States is in "a Cold War with the Chinese Communist Party".</p>

<p>He has said the United States must learn from the experience of Ukraine's war with Russia by backing Taiwan in the face of China.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[US President Joe Biden has hailed the Lebanon ceasefire as a win, but his legacy is likely to remain overshadowed by Donald Trump's impending return and the failure to achieve peace in Gaza.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden has hailed the Lebanon ceasefire as a win, but his legacy is likely to remain overshadowed by Donald Trump's impending return and the failure to achieve peace in Gaza.</p>

<p>In a rare moment to savor in the lame-duck phase of his presidency, the 82-year-old spoke in the Rose Garden of the White House to announce the truce deal between Israel and Hezbollah.</p>

<p>Biden said the deal was "good news" and "brings us closer to realizing the affirmative agenda that I'm pushing forward during my entire presidency, a vision for the future of the Middle East."</p>

<p>He added that "in our remaining time in office I'll work tirelessly" to achieve it.</p>

<p>The ceasefire at least puts on hold one of the grinding wars that the Trump administration will inherit from Biden's White House on January 20, along with Gaza and Ukraine.</p>

<p>But the Lebanon deal is "lipstick on a pig," said Colin Clarke, director of research at the Soufan Group.</p>

<p>"Of course he's going to claim this as a win -- he's got nothing else to point to," Clarke told AFP. Biden was "whitewashing what has been a fairly disastrous approach to the region post-October 7."</p>

<p>Clarke was referring to Biden's strong support of Israel following the brutal attack by Hamas that triggered the war in Gaza and more than a year of cross-border fire and two months of all-out war in Lebanon.</p>

<p>US presidents famously have an eye on the way they will be judged by history and Biden is no exception.</p>

<p>But despite announcing a fresh push for an end to Israel's war in Gaza, Biden's dream of securing wider peace before he leaves office remains far off.</p>

<p>It reflects the wider sense that Biden's legacy will be a tarnished one.</p>

<p>When he took office he said he wanted to "save the soul of America" and show the world that "America is back" after Trump's turbulent first presidency.</p>

<p>But pride made him resist growing concerns about his age and mental acuity until a disastrous debate against Trump forced him to drop his bid for a second term in July.</p>

<p>Trump then comprehensively defeated his chosen successor, Vice President Kamala Harris, on November 5.</p>

<p><strong>'Trump's problem'</strong></p>

<p>Since the election Biden has spent much time trying to "Trump-proof" what he regards as his main foreign policy achievements.</p>

<p>Nowhere is that truer than on US support for Ukraine.</p>

<p>In the past two weeks the once-cautious Biden has given Ukraine the green light to use US-supplied missiles against targets in Russia and ordered landmines to be sent to Ukraine.</p>

<p>Tensions have since soared with Moscow. Trump had previously promised to secure a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia within 24 hours but has yet to unveil his administration's policy.</p>

<p>Biden also embarked on a last-minute diplomatic tour of South America during which he tried to reassure unsettled US allies -- and adversary China -- that the transition to a Trump presidency would be smooth.</p>

<p>The Lebanon deal is a further example of his attempts to shore up his legacy -- but the failure to end the grinding war in Gaza hangs heavy over him.</p>

<p>"I do not expect a victory lap. This is only one of three fronts and arguably not the most important," Garrett Martin of American University told AFP.</p>

<p>"It reinforces the sentiment of great frustration that the Biden administration has been trying to deal with."</p>

<p>Biden's frustrations in dealing with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have spilled into the open over the 13 months of the Gaza war, as the Israeli has resisted US chiding over the civilian death toll.</p>

<p>For his part, Netanyahu threw some shade Biden's way on Tuesday -- and looked ahead to a Trump administration that he hopes will give Israel freer rein.</p>

<p>"It is no secret that there have been big delays in weapons and munitions deliveries. These delays will be resolved soon," Netanyahu said in a televised address announcing the deal on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Still, Trump, despite being a man who famously likes the art of the deal, may find the Middle East as troublesome as Biden.</p>

<p>"Legacies can be shared. Now it's going to be Trump's problem," said Martin.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Walmart has scaled back its diversity initiatives, including removing LGBTQ products from its website and closing a nonprofit that supported minority programs.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Walmart has decided to stop some programs that support diversity. This includes removing products related to the LGBTQ+ community from its website and ending a non-profit organisation that helped minority groups. This step aligns with a broader corporate trend of reducing diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs.</p>

<p>According to<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/26/walmart-pulls-back-on-dei-efforts-removes-some-lbgtq-merchandise-.html"><em> CNBC,</em></a> the largest employer in the US, which has about 1.6 million workers, joined a growing list of companies that have stepped back from diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts after feeling the heat from conservative activists. Some have also attributed changes to the US Supreme Court's decision last year that struck down affirmative action programs at colleges.</p>

<p>This step aligns with a broader corporate trend of reducing diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs. Other companies like Tractor Supply, Lowe's, Ford, Molson Coors, Bud Light, and Target have also walked back some of their equity and inclusion policies in recent months.</p>

In a statement, Walmart said it is "willing to change alongside our associates and customers who represent all of America."</p>

<p>"We've been on a journey and know we aren't perfect, but every decision comes from a place of wanting to foster a sense of belonging, to open doors to opportunities for all our associates, customers, and suppliers, and to be a Walmart for everyone," the statement said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Trump's transition team is now readying an announcement of Jamieson Greer as US Trade Representative, people familiar with the matter said.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump fired an opening shot in his tariff battle with Beijing by promising an additional 10 per cent levy on Chinese goods. The question that now confronts President Xi Jinping is how much more is coming.</p>

<p>The threat by the US president-elect, made on his Truth Social network on Monday, was in retribution for what he said was China's failure to stop "drugs pouring into our Country, mostly through Mexico." It wasn't clear from the post whether the 10 per cent tariff level was an additional levy to an earlier warning of 60 per cent or represented a climbdown.</p>

<p>"This is an early test of Xi's willingness to play ball with the new Trump administration," said Neil Thomas, a fellow for Chinese politics at the Asia Society Policy Institute's Center for China Analysis. "Agreeing to Trump's demands could avoid a painful tariff, but might encourage him to impose more tariffs to try and extract more concessions."</p>

<p>Trump's gambit risks setting in motion a standoff between the world's two biggest economies following an election campaign that already brought fears over a new wave of protectionism to the forefront. In related posts, Trump said he'd slap 25 per cent tariffs on all products from Mexico and Canada, citing concerns over illegal immigration and the flow of drugs like fentanyl.</p>

<p>Trump's transition team is now readying an announcement of Jamieson Greer as US Trade Representative, people familiar with the matter said, which would put in place a veteran negotiator who has called countering China's trade policies a "generational challenge" for the US.</p>

<p>China responded on Tuesday by defending its track record and refrained from mentioning any planned retaliation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While calling fentanyl the "US's problem," the Foreign Ministry praised the achievements of counter-narcotics cooperation between the two countries, saying in a statement that China has provided support to fight the trafficking.</p>

<p>"China is willing to continue anti-drug cooperation with the US on basis of equality, mutual benefit and mutual respect," it said. "The US should cherish China's goodwill and maintain the hard-won good situation of China-US anti-drug cooperation."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Liu Pengyu, spokesman for the Chinese embassy in the US, earlier said Beijing had informed Washington of the progress made in counter-narcotics efforts and described as "mutually beneficial" economic and trade cooperation between both countries. "No one will win a trade war or a tariff war," he wrote on X.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What Next</strong></p>

<p>The biggest uncertainty now centers on whether Beijing would reprise a playbook used during the first trade war started by Trump, when Xi's government initially embraced a strategy of "strategic composure" that sought to avoid escalating disputes and generally waited for the US to act before any retaliation.</p>

<p>Later, it switched gears by adopting a more aggressive style of conducting international relations referred to as "Wolf Warrior Diplomacy" - an approach it's since backed away from.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Howells is suing Newport City Council for Rs 4,900 crore (495 million pounds), accusing them of blocking access to the landfill.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A woman has reportedly admitted to accidentally discarding the hard drive containing access to her ex-boyfriend James Howells' lost Bitcoin fortune- now worth an astonishing Rs 5,900 crore (569 million pounds). &nbsp;</p>

<p>Halfina Eddy-Evans, the mother of Howells' two teenage sons, told <em>Daily Mail </em>that nearly a decade ago, she took the hard drive to a landfill in Newport, Wales, as part of a cleanup at Howells' request. "Yes, I threw away his rubbish. He asked me to," she explained. "I had no idea what was inside. Losing it wasn't my fault." &nbsp;</p>

<p>Howells mined 8,000 Bitcoins in 2009 but forgot about them until years later, when he realized the hard drive, containing the digital key to his cryptocurrency fortune, had been lost. Now buried under 100,000 tonnes of waste in a Newport landfill, the hard drive remains inaccessible despite its growing value. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Howells is suing Newport City Council for Rs 4,900 crore (495 million pounds), accusing them of blocking access to the landfill. "This treasure hunt isn't going away," Howells told <em>Fortune</em>. "The value grows every day." &nbsp;</p>

<p>However, the council has repeatedly denied his requests to excavate, citing environmental concerns and permit limitations. A spokesperson stated, "Excavation is not possible under our environmental permit, and such work would have a huge negative impact on the area." &nbsp;</p>

<p>Eddy-Evans insists she wants no part of the fortune if it's recovered. "I hope he finds it, not that I want a penny. I just want him to stop talking about it," she said, adding that the situation has taken a toll on Howells' mental health. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Howells has pledged to donate 10% of the fortune to transform Newport into "the Dubai or Las Vegas of the UK" if the hard drive is recovered. For now, his legal battle continues, with a hearing scheduled for early December. &nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Trump Guitars, whose website boasts a picture of the US president-elect holding a six-string, has received a "cease and desist" letter from Gibson, whose guitars have been favorites of musicians including Bob Dylan and Chuck Berry.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A guitar company touting an endorsement by Donald Trump has become embroiled in a trademark dispute, accused of imitating an iconic instrument, US media reported Tuesday.</p>

<p>Trump Guitars, whose website boasts a picture of the US president-elect holding a six-string, has received a "cease and desist" letter from Gibson, whose guitars have been favorites of musicians including Bob Dylan and Chuck Berry.</p>

<p>The letter warns Trump Guitars owner 16 Creative that the design of their product "infringes upon Gibson's exclusive trademarks, particularly the iconic Les Paul body shape," US outlets said.</p>

<p>Trump Guitars, which says on its website it has "the ONLY guitar endorsed" by the incoming commander-in-chief has already sold out of its Trump-autographed American Eagle electric guitar, which had a price tag of $11,500.</p>

<p>The company is also offering a "Presidential Series" in red, gold or black, whose shape bears a striking resemblance to the Les Paul, but which has "DONALD J. TRUMP" inlaid on the fretboard.</p>

<p>However, the site notes: "The images shown are for illustration purposes only and may not be an exact representation of the product."</p>

<p>The website also offers a disclaimer that it is not in any way affiliated to Gibson Brands Inc.</p>

<p>The guitars, the site notes, are "manufactured by multiple providers and include parts/features that are both domestic and international."</p>

<p>It was not immediately clear if they would be affected by a proposed 25 percent blanket tariff the incoming president says he intends to impose on products shipped from Mexico or Canada.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>George Stubbs' popular painting of a Spanish pointer dog will go under the hammer at Sotheby London next week, 52 years after it was last auctioned. The 18th-century portrait is likely to fetch somewhere between 1,500,000-2,000,000 pounds, according to a <a href="http://https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/26/style/george-stubbs-spanish-pointer-auction-intl-scli/index.html" rel="nofollow noindex" target="_blank">CNN</a> report. The iconic painting was last sold for 30,000 pounds ($37,700) at the 1972 auction and 11 pounds ($14) at the 1802 auction.</p>

<p>According to Sotheby's, “The Spanish Pointer” is believed to have been painted between 1766 and 1768 and is considered one of the most famous pieces of work by Stubbs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“It is always very exciting when a painting of this calibre re-emerges after being ‘lost,'” said Julian Gascoigne, a senior director and British paintings specialist at Sotheby's.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The pointer dog breed shown in the painting was brought to England from Spain at the beginning of the eighteenth century. Sportsmen valued the canines for their hunting prowess and obedience.</p>

<p>The massive bones at the back of the head and the broad nostrils are two of the animal's distinctive features that Stubbs depicts in this piece of art.</p>

<p>“It demonstrates his versatility and innate understanding of animal anatomy of all species,” said Gascoigne.<br />
<br />
Since it was first painted, Stubbs's The Spanish Pointer has only had one official exhibition, in 1948 at the National Gallery of Sports and Pastimes in London. It was not available for public viewing again until 1972 when it was sold at Sotheby's.<br />
<br />
A largely self-taught artist completed fewer than 400 paintings in his career. Stubbs' talent made him well-known for his portrayals of animals, especially horses. His training in anatomy helped him do justice to his artwork.<br />
<br />
In addition to his works in the Tate Britain collection of ancient British art, his painting "Whistlejacket," which depicts a racehorse, is on display in London's National Gallery.<br />
<br />
"The Spanish Pointer" will be displayed at Sotheby's exhibition of 19th-century and old master paintings until early December.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former rugby union player James Haskell, who has been best friends with Prince Harry for a long time, has labelled the British royal family "very dysfunctional", adding, some of the members "aren't as great as others."</p>

<p>Mr Haskell opened up about his bond with Harry and his family in an interview with <a href="https://www.thetimes.com/magazines/the-times-magazine/article/james-haskell-royals-rugby-interview-p6fhqzcbh?t=1732610047176" rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">the London Times</a> and said he has spent a lot of time with them over the past several years.</p>

<p>"They do amazing work — but they're also a modern family that's very dysfunctional," Mr Haskell said.</p>

<p>He said he was in attendance when Harry got married to Meghan Markle, adding he was even a part of "Mike and Zara's wedding."</p>

<p>Despite criticising some of them, the 39-year-old defended the monarchy, saying they “serve an important role”.</p>

<p>"To those who want to get rid of the monarchy — once they're gone, they're gone. There's no way back from that, so remember they serve an important role. I love what they do," he added.</p>

<p>In the last few years, all has not been well between the royal family and Prince Harry and Meghan, particularly after the Duke and Duchess of Sussex moved out of the family. It got no better after Harry opened up about his issues with his father and brother in his memoir, <em>Spare</em>.</p>

<p>Earlier, a source close to the family told People magazine that although the rift between Prince Harry and his brother Prince William was “very bad,” it wasn't “irreparable.”</p>

<p>Harry visited his homeland last month but did not see either his father or brother during the trip.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Haskell continues to share a special connection with the royal family as he hosts “The Good, the Bad &amp; the Rugby” podcast along with Alex Payne and Mike Tindall, who is married to Zara Phillips, daughter of Princess Anne.</p>

<p>The Tindalls are said to be close to both Prince William and his wife Kate Middleton and Harry's family.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Romance scams – where scammers create fake identities and use dating or friendship to get your trust and money –&nbsp;<a href="https://www.accc.gov.au/about-us/publications/serial-publications/targeting-scams-reports-on-scams-activity/targeting-scams-report-of-the-accc-on-scams-activity-2023">cost Australians</a>&nbsp;A$201 million last year.</p>

<p>But the emotional impact of romance scams can often feel worse than losing money. Those who have been scammed may experience shame and embarrassment and have difficulty accepting the relationship wasn't real.</p>

<p>People who have acquired a brain injury, for example after a stroke or car accident, may be more vulnerable to these scams.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09602011.2021.2016447?journalCode=pnrh20">My research with colleagues</a>&nbsp;shows they are often less aware of scams and find it harder to recognise red flags.</p>

<p>But our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/eprint/F5AFEDMNVNCQSMUDBMQ2/full?target=10.1080/09638288.2022.2139418">project</a>&nbsp;has found there are benefits when people with brain injuries who have been scammed share their experiences. It can create awareness, reduce stigma and help prevent future scams.</p>

<h2>Some groups are more vulnerable</h2>

<p>Anyone can be scammed. But&nbsp;<a href="https://www.accc.gov.au/about-us/publications/serial-publications/targeting-scams-reports-on-scams-activity/targeting-scams-report-of-the-accc-on-scams-activity-2023">some groups are more at risk</a>, including people with a disability such as an acquired brain injury.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/brain-impairment/article/do-we-need-to-know-about-cyberscams-in-neurorehabilitation-a-crosssectional-scoping-survey-of-australasian-clinicians-and-service-providers/D2572ABFB991DC974FB7E489B8CA11D1#">We surveyed</a>&nbsp;101 clinicians in Australia and New Zealand who work with people who have acquired brain injuries. More than half (53%) had a client who had been affected by a cyberscam. The most common type was a romance scam.</p>

<h2>How do romance scams work?</h2>

<p>Romance scams involve a scammer (or sometimes multiple people) luring someone into a fake relationship in order to exploit them, often to get money. Scammers may use online dating platforms to connect, or social media, gaming and even online shopping sites.</p>

<p>Romance scammers build trust and strong emotions using techniques such as love bombing (early and frequent declarations of affection), grooming and manipulation over an extended period of time. They share common interests and even similar types of trauma to make people trust them. As a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09602011.2021.2016447?journalCode=pnrh20">romance scam survivor</a>&nbsp;with an acquired brain injury explained:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My way of thinking was sort of skewed because all I seen was love, the money, all the things I wanted, so I didn't worry about all the other little stuff.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The identity of the scammer usually appears very attractive and trustworthy but is often fake, stolen from a real person or&nbsp;<a href="https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/">AI-generated</a>. They present lots of evidence and exciting details about their everyday life to appear real and keep people hooked into the relationship.</p>

<p><a href="https://socialcatfish.com/scamfish/how-we-got-a-hold-of-a-romance-scammers-playbook/">Scammers use pre-written scripts</a>&nbsp;with compelling narratives describing significant financial success, being a widower or orphan, or working overseas to attract people. Flirty language and flattery makes people want to keep communicating with the scammer. They might tell you they think you have a beautiful smile and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.smh.com.au/national/hello-amazingness-leaked-romance-scammers-scripts-20190417-p51ezu.html">their dog or cat would love you</a>.</p>

<p>Scammers will invest weeks and months to build up a connection, then scammers present exciting “opportunities”. These may include investments and requests to cover international flights for a first meet-up. Or paying for medical bills for a sick relative. As a scam survivor with an acquired brain injury&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09602011.2021.2016447?journalCode=pnrh20">explained</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>She was really jumping into a kind of quite intimate relationship with me, even though we haven't met yet, but she's promising we will one day. All I need to do is send money.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Why are people with brain injuries more at risk?</h2>

<p>One in 45 Australians&nbsp;<a href="https://www.aihw.gov.au/getmedia/1f719b27-6b93-434a-b0e6-997b4ead061a/bulletin55.pdf">lives with</a>&nbsp;a brain injury acquired during an event such as car accident or stroke. This can damage a specific part of the brain, widespread brain cells (neurons), or both.</p>

<p><a href="https://synapse.org.au/fact-sheet/what-is-brain-injury/">The impact of a brain injury</a>&nbsp;varies but can affect cognition, emotions, behaviour and neurological functioning. As a result, people can experience changes in their ability to care for themselves, work, socialise and make complex decisions.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.jmir.org/2024/1/e51245">Cognitive difficulties</a>&nbsp;– such as memory problems and reduced information processing – can make it harder to learn, notice and respond to scam red flags in real time. People may struggle to comprehend new or complex information, have reduced judgement and be more impulsive.</p>

<p>Like other vulnerable Australians, people with brain injury may also be&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09602011.2021.2016447?journalCode=pnrh20">bored, lonely and require care</a>. This may mean the scammers' constant online availability, messaging, attention, praise and acceptance of the person regardless of their disability is even more attractive.</p>

<h2>Shame and embarrassment</h2>

<p>People with acquired brain injuries may also struggle to move from knowing or intending to do something, to actually enacting that behaviour. This is called the&nbsp;<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9353325/#:%7E:text=The%20%E2%80%9Cfrontal%20lobe%20paradox%E2%80%9D%20(,and%20test%20settings%20(3).)">frontal lobe paradox</a>. As one of our interviewees&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09602011.2021.2016447?journalCode=pnrh20">explained</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I make some big realisations and then I forget about it, like … ‘don't do that again'. And then I go and do it again.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When the scam is uncovered, family, friends and frontline services such as police and banks may respond with blame, judgement and ridicule. This&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09602011.2021.2016447?journalCode=pnrh20">contributes</a>&nbsp;to further distress:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They just say how stupid I was for being conned.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Scams are likely under-reported to authorities such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.scamwatch.gov.au/">Scamwatch</a>&nbsp;as a result of shame and a lack of awareness about scams.</p>

<p>Family and clinicians of people with brain injury may&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/brain-impairment/article/do-we-need-to-know-about-cyberscams-in-neurorehabilitation-a-crosssectional-scoping-survey-of-australasian-clinicians-and-service-providers/D2572ABFB991DC974FB7E489B8CA11D1">cut or reduce their access to money or the internet</a>, which adds to the scam's financial and emotional impacts.</p>

<p>As one&nbsp;<a href="https://www.jmir.org/2024/1/e51245">clinician explained</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The depression […] didn't come from being scammed. It came from quite the opposite, almost like he […] feels like it's his right to have access and leave himself open to those things.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Authentic partnerships with people with lived experience</h2>

<p>Our research team has developed a suite of tailored resources called&nbsp;<a href="https://cyberability.org.au/">CyberAbility</a>, which were co-designed with people who have brain injuries and experience of being scammed. We call them “<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/eprint/F5AFEDMNVNCQSMUDBMQ2/full?target=10.1080/09638288.2022.2139418">Scambassadors</a>”.</p>

<p>The Scambassadors alleviate some of the stigma and shame associated with being scammed, through conducting community education sessions, speaking with media, and co-facilitating therapy groups. They also spread awareness to other people with brain injuries about what to look out for – but the advice is helpful for everyone.</p>

<p>You can look out for signs someone in your life is being scammed. This could include a new unmet lover, major unexpected purchases or loans, or an increase in secrecy about online activities.</p>

<p>Approach difficult conversations about possible scams with curiosity, care and patience. Share your own experiences of being scammed or ripped off to normalise this and reduce judgement.</p>

<p>Whoever is scammed, the real fault lies with the criminals who commit this fraud. But regularly discussing scams can help reduce stigma and protect our community.</p>

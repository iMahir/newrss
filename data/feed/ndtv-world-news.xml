       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Florida judge appointed by Donald Trump has dismissed the criminal case against the former president on charges of mishandling top secret documents, saying the way that Special Counsel Jack Smith was appointed was improper.</p>

<p>The decision is a huge victory for Trump, who had been accused of endangering national security by holding onto top secret documents after leaving the White House.</p>

<p>Judge Aileen Cannon made her ruling after lawyers for the 78-year-old argued for a partial stay of proceedings to allow for an assessment of a Supreme Court ruling that a former president has broad immunity from prosecution.</p>

<p>"Former President Trump's Motion to Dismiss Indictment Based on the Unlawful Appointment and Funding of Special Counsel Jack Smith is GRANTED," Aileen wrote in her order.</p>

<p>"The Superseding Indictment is DISMISSED because Special Counsel Smith's appointment violates the Appointments Clause of the United States Constitution."</p>

<p>It comes as Trump is set to be anointed as his party's champion at the Republican National Convention, days after surviving an assassination attempt at a rally in Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>In the Florida case, Trump was facing 31 counts of "willful retention of national defense information," each punishable by up to 10 years in prison.</p>

<p>He also faced charges of conspiracy to obstruct justice and making false statements.</p>

<p>Trump allegedly kept classified documents -- which included records from the Pentagon and CIA -- unsecured at his Mar-a-Lago home and thwarted efforts to retrieve them.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Monday that Russia should be represented at a second summit aiming to secure lasting peace with the Kremlin, after more than two years of war.</p>

<p>Dozens of world leaders voiced support for a just peace in Ukraine after a high-level summit convened by Zelensky last month in Switzerland, to which Russia was not invited.</p>

<p>"I believe that Russian representatives should be at the second summit," Zelensky told a press conference in Kyiv, where he laid out preparatory work for a follow-up summit.</p>

<p>Zelensky announced separate meetings on key issues, including energy security, to be held in Qatar and on food security in Turkey ahead of a second summit.</p>

<p>Leaders and top officials from more than 90 states gathered at a Swiss mountainside resort on June 15 for the two-day summit dedicated to resolving the largest European conflict since World War II.</p>

<p>The Kremlin said that any discussions around ending the conflict that did not include Russia were "absurd."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An anti-terrorism court here on Monday charged top Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf leader and former foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi in a case involving the burning down of a police station during the May 9 violence last year.</p>

<p>Mr Qureshi, 68, who was brought to Kot Lakhpat jail here from Adiala jail in Rawalpindi under tight security, has several cases related to May 9 violence, including arson, filed against him at the Shadman police station.</p>

<p>The court had summoned Mr Qureshi to initiate indictment proceedings against him and ordered the prosecution to present witnesses in the next hearing scheduled for July 22.</p>

<p>Mr Qureshi, who was produced before ATC Judge Khalid Arshad, however, denied the charges.</p>

<p>"As Mr Qureshi was presented before the ATC judge, charges were framed against him for his alleged abetment in torching Lahore's Shadman police station. Mr Qureshi pleaded not guilty and maintained that a fake case has been instituted against him for being loyal to Imran Khan," a court official told Press Trust of India after the hearing.</p>

<p>The indictment of Mr Qureshi, who is also the vice-chairman of PTI, came hours before the Pakistan government announced its decision to ban Khan's PTI for its alleged involvement in anti-state activities.</p>

<p>The Lahore police had registered a case against several leaders and activists of the PTI on the charges of attacking and burning down the Shadman police station during the May 9 riots following the arrest of former prime minister Imran Khan by the Rangers in an alleged corruption case.</p>

<p>Besides this case, multiple cases related to the May 9 violence have been lodged against Mr Qureshi in Lahore alone.</p>

<p>Mr Qureshi has been in prison since he and Mr Khan, 71, were sentenced by a Pakistani court to 10 years in jail for violating the Official Secrets Act by making a diplomatic cable public when the PTI founder was in power.</p>

<p>Though the Islamabad High Court (IHC) on June 3 acquitted Mr Khan and Mr Qureshi in the Cipher case, suspending their 10-year sentence, the two remain in jail as they are named in multiple cases in connection with the May 9 violence across Pakistan.</p>

<p>Mr Qureshi was earlier this year indicted in eight more cases related to the May 9 violence.</p>

<p>The May 9 riots were triggered across the country after Khan was arrested by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) in the 190-million-pound corruption case. He is currently facing over 200 cases and has been in jail since August last year.</p>

<p>Hundreds of PTI workers and senior leaders were put behind bars for their involvement in violence and attacks on military installations, including the Jinnah House, ISI building in Faisalabad and General Headquarters (GHQ) in Rawalpindi, last year on May 9.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Stating that terrorism is a major challenge faced by the world today, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar said that the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) has to play a major role in the region's security.</p>

<p>In an interview with Kazinform News Agency in Astana, Kazakhstan, the EAM said that SCO's priority is to fight against the three evils -- Terrorism, Separatism and Extremism.</p>

<p>"There is no doubt that the major challenge faced by the world today is terrorism. It has become a threat to regional and global peace, and it demands urgent action from all of us. In this aspect, I am happy that Kazakhstan during their Chairmanship have negotiated an updated program to combat terrorism, separatism, and extremism, which was adopted in Astana Summit," he said.</p>

<p>"Fight against the three evils- Terrorism, Separatism and Extremism- is a priority in SCO," EAM Jaishankar added.</p>

<p>He further said that some joint statements were adopted on theme during India's presidency of SCO last year.</p>

<p>Stating that Kazakhstan has also carried forward the spirit of that Joint Statement, Jaishankar also laid emphasis on the importance of implementation of these statements.</p>

<p>"During the New Delhi Summit last year, one of the two Joint Statements adopted was on 'Countering Radicalization leading to Terrorism, Separatism and Extremism'. The statements included various elements of radicalization -- including ideology, media campaigns, as well as radical and terrorist content on internet," the Foreign Minister said.</p>

<p>"Kazakhstan, during their Chairmanship, carried forward the spirit of that Joint Statement. The updated program to combat terrorism, separatism and extremism is critical and timely. But I want to emphasize that what is more important is the actual implementation of the program that we have now successfully drawn up, which includes unambiguous commitment by all the Member States in getting rid of all forms and manifestations of terrorism in the region, including cross-border terrorism," he further stated.</p>

<p>Jaishankar, represented India at the SCO Council of Heads of State (SCO Summit) held under Kazakhstan's Presidency in Astana.</p>

<p>He delivered remarks on behalf of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The EAM also held several bilateral meetings and engagements with counterparts and other global leaders.</p>

<p>Emphasising SCO's role in the region's security, Jaishankar said SCO as an organization should be allowed to fully utilize its potential, and also highlighted the theme of SCO Summit 'Towards a SECURE SCO' in 2023 under India's presidency.</p>

<p>"In fact, India's priorities for the Chairmanship last year were on the theme 'Towards a SECURE SCO' -- with SECURE being an acronym which stands for Security, Economic cooperation, Connectivity, Unity, Respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, and Environment," the Foreign Minister said.</p>

<p>"When we say regional security in the context of SCO, the most important issues that stand out is terrorism, including cross-border terrorism. Today, after decades of taking measures against terrorism in global forums, including through the UNSC, terrorism continues to be a threat to the region. The UN designated terror outfits are still functioning in the region," he added.</p>

<p>He further said that combating terrorism requires a very comprehensive approach, not just against the perpetrators of heinous acts of terrorism, but also against the facilitators, financiers and sponsors of terrorism.</p>

<p>"They all need to be identified and punished," he said.</p>

<p>Jaishankar said Regional Anti-Terrrorist Structure (RATS) has a reasonable standing to propose measures against terrorism in the region.</p>

<p>"We stand ready to strengthen SCO mechanisms in this front. I hope that the proposed Universal Centre to be established within the RATS in Tashkent, along with the other specialized centers under the Universal Centre, will grow to become foremost anti-terrorist structure in the region," he said.</p>

<p>Stressing on the need to build consensus, the Foreign Minister said any security related initiative or paradigm should be formulated taking into consideration territorial integrity and sovereignty of all the countries that will be involved</p>

<p>The Foreign Minister also elaborated on the threat of drug trafficking. He said there is a consensus on the establishment of Anti-Drug Centre in Dushanbe, Tajikistan and along with Universal Centre, it will be an effective weapon to combat drug trafficking.</p>

<p>"Drug Trafficking is another issue that we need to combat together, and is very closely related to two other issues in the region -- terrorism and stability in Afghanistan. There is a consensus on the establishment of Anti-Drug Centre in Dushanbe. This is a welcome move and is much needed. The Anti-Drug Centre, together with the proposed Universal Centre, will be an effective weapon in combating drug trafficking," Mr Jaishankar said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Monday said he was not concerned at the prospect of another Donald Trump presidency in the United States, despite indications his administration could be more sympathetic to the Kremlin.</p>

<p>A Trump victory in the US November elections would put into question Washington's continued support for Ukraine as the country struggles through a third year of fighting against Russian forces.</p>

<p>"I think that if Donald Trump becomes president, we will work together. I'm not worried about this," Zelensky said during a press conference in Kyiv.</p>

<p>The Republican Party candidate has suggested that he would end the conflict very quickly if he won back the presidency, which Kyiv fears would mean it would be forced to negotiate with Moscow from a weakened position.</p>

<p>Zelensky said that during his recent trip to the US for a NATO defence alliance summit he had met Republican governors and was assured of the party's backing.</p>

<p>"There are hawks whose messages are more right-wing or more radical," Zelensky told reporters.</p>

<p>"But I want to tell you that the majority of the Republican Party supports Ukraine and the people of Ukraine," he added.</p>

<p>Trump previously said during a debate with President Joe Biden that if elected, he would have the Ukraine conflict "settled" before he took office in January 2025.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US researchers have decoded an element that could destroy cancerous cells, and advance treatment options for the deadly disease that claims millions of lives globally.</p>

<p>The element, actinium, was first discovered by French scientist Andre-Louis Debierne in 1899 and is number 89 on the Periodic Table.</p>

<p>Now after 125 years of its existence, there is a bright chance it could improve cancer treatments, as found by the Department of Energy's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.</p>

<p>Even after 125 years, actinium remains an enigmatic element of science because to date it is found in extremely small quantities, and special facilities are needed to work with it, not just any ordinary radioactive lab.</p>

<p>The team of scientists tried growing it and while elements can behave very similarly to their lightweight counterparts, actinium behaved differently than its counterpart lanthanum.</p>

<p>From nuclear energy to medicine, these elements can serve the purpose admirably, for both are radioactive and earthy minerals, it is not actinium itself that saves the day, it is an isotope -- a distinct nuclear species of any element -- named actinium 225 that has shown promise in a method called targeted alpha therapy (TAT).</p>

<p>The TAT technique transports radioactive elements to the cancer site via biological delivery mechanisms such as peptides or antibodies.</p>

<p>When actinium decays, it emits energetic particles that travel a short distance, killing local cancer cells while sparing healthy tissue further away.</p>

<p>"If we can engineer proteins to bind the actinium with a high affinity, and either be fused with an antibody or serve as the targeting protein that would really enable new ways to develop radiopharmaceuticals." said Rebecca Abergel, Associate Professor of nuclear engineering at the University of California- Berkeley.</p>

<p>Researchers employed a revolutionary way to create the crystals with only 5 micrograms of pure actinium, which is about one-tenth the weight of a grain of salt and unnoticeable to the naked eye.</p>

<p>They initially refined the actinium using a complicated filtration method that removed other elements and chemical contaminants.</p>

<p>They next attached the actinium to a metal-trapping molecule known as a ligand and encased the bundle inside a protein identified and purified by Roland Strong's team at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Centre, resulting in a "macromolecular scaffold."</p>

<p>The crystals, which grew for a week inside the Heavy Element Research Laboratory, were then cryocooled in liquid nitrogen and irradiated with X-rays at Berkeley Lab's Advanced Light Source.</p>

<p>X-rays revealed the compound's three-dimensional structure and demonstrated how this elusive element works with other surrounding atoms.</p>

<p>This study used the longest-living isotope of actinium, Actinium 227 although Actinium 225 is the preferred one for the Targeted Alpha method (as it has been used for prostate cancer as well with positive results).</p>

<p>The final word has not yet been said but the initial prose is the melodious beginning of a future scientific opera which would herald a new era of cancer treatment, the researchers said.<br />

<p>Responding to Prime Minister Modi's congratulatory message on his appointment as Nepal's prime minister for the fourth time, Mr Oli thanked the Indian leader for his warm wishes.</p>

<p>"Thank you, Prime Minister @narendramodi for your warm congratulations. I am committed to working closely with you to strengthen Nepal-India relations for our mutual benefit. Together, we can elevate our historic ties to new heights," the newly appointed prime minister said on X.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Record immigration caused the population of England and Wales to rise by 610,000 to 60.9 million in mid-2023, the largest annual increase in 75 years, official data showed on Monday.</p>

<p>What statisticians term 'natural' population growth - the difference between births and deaths - fell to just 400, the lowest since 1978, while net international migration rose to 622,000, up from 548,500 in the previous 12 months.</p>

<p>A net 13,800 people also moved from England and Wales to Scotland or Northern Ireland.</p>

<p>Britain's Office for National Statistics said the population increase in England and Wales was the largest since 1948 when a post-World War Two baby boom and the return of British military personnel serving overseas caused a rise of 1.5 million.</p>

<p>The population for the whole United Kingdom was 67.6 million in mid 2022. Data for 2023 is not yet available.</p>

<p>Economic output has not kept up with the rising population. Based on provisional population figures, gross domestic product per head in 2023 was 0.7% lower than a year earlier.</p>

<p>Net migration to the United Kingdom hit a record 764,000 in 2022 and fell 10% to 685,000 in 2023, but is more than double its level in 2015, just before the Brexit referendum.</p>

<p>Reducing immigration was a key goal of many Britons who voted to leave the European Union.</p>

<p>Britain's previous Conservative government said it wanted to reduce net immigration, and Prime Minister Keir Starmer's Labour Party pledged in the election campaign to do so too by making the economy less reliant on foreign workers.</p>

<p>Post-Brexit changes to visas sharply reduced the number of EU migrants to Britain, but new work visa rules led to a surge in immigration from India, Nigeria and Pakistan, often to fill health and social care vacancies.</p>

<p>At the end of last year the government tightened rules to stop low-paid social care workers from bringing dependents.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Stories created with help of ChatGPT are more creative, engaging their audience with more plot twists, compared to those by writers not using the tool, according to research.</p>

<p>However, researchers also found that diversity in stories by writers using generative artificial intelligence's (GenAI) suffered, therefore increasing the risk of "collective novelty".</p>

<p>GenAI can create content -- text, image, audio or video -- and is based on large language models, which are trained on massive amounts of text data and can, therefore, process, interpret and respond to requests in the natural language that humans use to communicate.</p>

<p>The authors of the study, published in the journal Science Advances, found that writers inherently more creative benefitted the least from ideas generated by ChatGPT, while those less creative became more creative due to ideas suggested by the GenAI model.</p>

<p>Therefore, AI "effectively equalised creativity" among all the writers, the team of researchers said.</p>

<p>"While these results point to an increase in individual creativity, there is risk of losing collective novelty. If the publishing industry were to embrace more generative AI-inspired stories, our findings suggest that the stories would become less unique in aggregate and more similar to each other," said study author Anil Doshi, assistant professor at the University College London's School of Management, UK.</p>

<p>For the study, 300 participants were tasked with writing a short, eight-sentence story (a 'microstory') for a target audience of young adults, of whom 600 were recruited to judge the writers' work.</p>

<p>The writers were divided into three groups. The first was allowed no help from AI, while the second was allowed to take one idea, along with the first three sentences of the story, created by ChatGPT for inspiration. The third group was allowed to choose from up to five AI-created story ideas.</p>

<p>The authors found that the work of writers taking the AI's help were over 8-9 per cent more novel, compared to that of writers not relying on the AI. Along with novelty, the microstories were judged for "usefulness" -- were they engaging enough for the audience, and could they be developed and potentially published?</p>

<p>The team also found that the less creative writers 'became' more so, with AI making their stories more novel by 10.7 per cent and more useful by 11.5 per cent, compared to the stories of writers not taking AI's help.</p>

<p>The AI made the work by less creative writers up to 26.6 per cent better, 22.6 per cent more enjoyable and 15.2 per cent less boring, the authors found.</p>

<p>The inherent creativity of the writers was measured using a psychological test -- Divergent Association Task (DAT).</p>

<p>Divergent thinking, which allows one to think of multiple solutions to a problem spontaneously, is known to be important to creativity.</p>

<p>Further, the authors found that among the writers using GenAI's ideas, the stories they produced were 10.7 per cent more similar, compared to the writers not using AI.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US Secret Service is under fire over its most stunning failure in decades following the assassination attempt on Donald Trump and several witnesses claiming that they had flagged the shooter to the officials before he took the shot are only adding to the crisis.</p>

<p>The questions facing the authorities are how a 20-year-old lone shooter was able to spot an exposed rooftop barely a football field away from the former president, assume the position, and take the shots, and why did officials not act despite several attendees pointing out the "shooter" on the roof.&nbsp;</p>

<p>One "citizen journalist" Grant Godwin posted a video filmed by supporters at the Trump rally that showed the alleged shooter getting in position.</p>

<p>"Officer! Officer!" a person is heard calling out to the security officials posted nearby and another saying, "Yeah, someone is on the roof", and pointing to the alleged shooter, 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks.</p>

<p>The "shooter" is seen climbing the roof of a shed, approximately just 400 ft, or less than 150 metres, from the stage where Trump was. He tries to stay down, crawling his way forward after getting on the roof.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Someone's on top of the roof... Right there... You see him? He's laying down... Yeah, he is laying down," a person is heard saying. &nbsp;</p>

<p>"Yeah, look, there he is..." said another.</p>

<p>Sharing the video on Instagram, Godwin wrote: "HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?! The amount of time the Secret Service and law enforcement had to neutralise this threat is ridiculous. I cannot wrap my head around this. You're telling me rally attendees noticed this guy way ahead of time, informed law enforcement, and still they didn't take this guy out before a shot was taken? Extremely concerning."</p>

<p>Reacting to the video, a user wrote: "I've seen better security at Foot Locker."</p>

<p>"So some random 20-year-old kid just is lucky enough to access the one spot to be able to have a clear shot of Trump? The only place they needed to secure? It makes no sense," said another.</p>

<p>"Walmart security could've taken that dude out," noted a third.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A man, 52, from Wisconsin and his 23-year-old daughter died after getting lost in Utah's Canyonlands National Park and running out of water in extreme heat. They two were hiking at 100-degree Fahrenheit (37.7 degrees Celsius), according to a report in the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/07/15/us-news/utah-canyonlands-national-park-hikers-die-after-getting-lost-running-out-of-water-in-100-degree-heat/"><em>New York Post.</em></a></p>

<p>National Park Service rangers reported that on Friday afternoon, someone in Canyonlands' Island of the Sky neighbourhood texted 911 to San Juan County dispatchers. After receiving the emergency call, the officials of the Bureau of Land Management's Moab District Helitack searched for the father and daughter.</p>

<p>However, by the time the pair was found, they were already dead, according to the National Park Service.</p>

<p>The tragedy marks the most recent deaths in National Parks this summer. In Arizona's Grand Canyon National Park, several hikers who were unprepared for temperatures in the triple digits died. A motorcyclist in California lost his life in Death Valley when the mercury reached 128 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>

<p>Rangers from the National Park Service encourage people to hike with plenty of water and to avoid hiking in the afternoon when temperatures are at their highest.</p>

<p>A severe heat wave swept central to eastern parts of the United States in June, with several cities recording their highest temperatures in decades, according to the National Weather Service (NWS). Experts warn that this heat wave could turn into a deadly weather event, labelling it the "silent killer."</p>

<p>Kristie Ebi, a public health scientist at the University of Washington who contributed to a United Nations special report on extreme weather, told PBS that in recent years, the heat "seems like it is coming faster and more severe than we expected."</p>

<p>The heat wave sweeping across much of the US is driven by what meteorologists call a "heat dome." This phenomenon involves a high-pressure system in the atmosphere that causes hot air to sink and compress, resulting in soaring temperatures at ground level. Approximately 80 million people across the US are experiencing sweltering conditions, with heat advisories or excessive heat warnings in place. Residents are urged to take precautions, stay hydrated and avoid prolonged exposure to the heat.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The assassination attempt on Donald Trump has provided the Republican leader with a unique opportunity to emerge as a taller leader, US political scientist Ian Bremmer told NDTV in an interview.</p>

<p>Mr Bremmer, author and founder of political risk research firm Eurasia Group, explained how the shooting at Trump's rally in Pennsylvania on Saturday will impact the US's political landscape in an election year and in the long-term.</p>

</div>

<p><strong>Boost To Trump's Image</strong></p>

<p>"This is a boost for Trump, the fact that he stood up immediately after being shot, with blood on his face, with a fist raised and said, 'fight, fight, fight'. That is an iconic image that will go down in the history of US and will certainly be replayed over and over in the media across the media and by Trump and his supporters in this campaign," Mr Bremmer said, adding that it will increase support for the former President.</p>

<p>"He will appear in Milwaukee on Monday at the Republican National Convention as 'Lazarus risen' and there will be incredible support."&nbsp;Lazarus is a Biblical figure who Jesus brings back to life four days after his death.</p>

<p>This boost in image, he said, also makes it more likely for Trump to win the November election.</p>

<p><strong>What Changes For Biden</strong></p>

<p>On the Democrats side, Mr Bremmer said, Saturday's developments have made it less likely for US President Joe Biden to "stand down". "There has been a lot of pressure since the disastrous debate Biden had against Trump. There was a lot of internal opposition in the party. That is now off... in the most tragic way possible. Biden had not been inclined to step down, but everyone around him was telling him he needed to. Now he has more time to resist that. The story has moved elsewhere," the political scientist said.</p>

<p><strong>Impact On US Politics</strong></p>

<p>Explaining how the assassination attempt is likely to impact the US political landscape, Mr Bremmer said it has created the potential for more violence and social instability "at a time when Americans are highly polarised and are being fed enormous amounts of disinformation". He also said political opposition are now being treated as "enemies".</p>

<p>Asked how the country will respond to Saturday's attack, the political scientist said, "There is a need for a 9/11-type response where the US rallies together and denounces political violence of all sorts. What I fear is going to happen is much more like January 6 (when Trump supporters stormed Capitol Hill).&nbsp;"For a couple of days and weeks, a lot of Americans were denouncing violence, Democrats and Republicans saying this is horrible, but very quickly, January 6 became a threat to democracy for Democrats, but for Republicans, these were patriots who should be lionised and are heroes. I fear that while today, there is outrage across the political spectrum, it will be weaponised."</p>

<p><strong>An Opportunity For Trump</strong></p>

<p>Mr Bremmer said Trump's response to the assassination will be critical to how the narrative around it shapes up.&nbsp;"Joe Biden gave a unifying statement. But it's really about Trump, he was the one who could have been killed. If he wants to stand and be a leader, rally people around a cause greater than him, he is in a unique position to do that. Unfortunately, there is nothing about his history that implies that he will do that," he said.</p>

<p>The Republican leader's political journey, Mr Bremmer said, has been about "dividing the country into us vs them". "That's how he made his billions and how he became President," he said.</p>

<p><strong>US's Image In World</strong></p>

<p>Mr Bremmer said that US is the most powerful country in the world, militarily, economically and technologically. "But America's political system and democracy are in crisis in a way it is not true in India, Europe, Japan or South Korea. Allies around the world are deeply troubled about that. And America's adversaries, particularly Russians, North Koreans and Iranians, see this as great news, an opportunity."</p>

<p>Russians, he said, are "pouring gasoline on fire". "They want US system to collapse," he said.</p>

<p>When he was a student, Mr Bremmer said, the US was "admired politically". "The US won the Cold War because its ideas were better, values were better, political system was better." While the US still has the strongest military, currency and technology, "no one around the world looks at the US political system and thinks I want my political system to work like this".</p>

<p><strong>On Political Extremism In US</strong></p>

<p>The political scientist said that the US, besides being the most dysfunctional of major democracies, also has large gun ownership and this includes military style weapons. "The only country which has more gun ownership than US is Yemen, and Yemen is in the middle of a civil war," he said.</p>

<p>This gun culture has been complimented by unaddressed mental illness, drug use and homelessness that has gone unaddressed, creating a very violent environment. "It has created tinder for an explosive political environment. The reason we haven't seen more political violence is because the US devotes an incredible amount of money and resources to prevent it." He said it is a big question why the Secret Service was "caught unawares yesterday". "This is clearly a major failure of the Secret Service and there will be a lot of investigation. What happened that allowed a shooter to get so close to former President Trump and pop off 6-8 shots, including one that hit him?"</p>

<p><strong>On What's Next</strong></p>

<p>The US, he said, is likely to see more security and surveillance after the assassination attempt on Trump. "Anyone who travels to the White House knows it's very different than it was before 9/11. That's a depressing thing but reality. I suspect we are moving much more towards monitoring of individuals," he said, also underlining privacy and human rights issues that will come with it.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US rapper Wiz Khalifa has been charged with illegal drug possession after he consumed cannabis on stage while performing at a seaside festival in Romania, prosecutors said Sunday.</p>

<p>The hip-hop star was headlining at the "Beach, Please!" festival in the Romanian village of Costinesti on the shore of the Black Sea, when he got caught with the drug early Sunday, prosecutors say.</p>

<p>Cannabis is considered a "risk drug" in Romania, and possession is punishable by up to ten years in prison.</p>

<p>Videos posted on social media show the rapper being escorted from the venue by Romanian authorities.</p>

<p>"During a performance at a music festival held in Costinesti, the accused was found to have possessed more than 18 grams of cannabis and to have consumed (on stage) another quantity in the form of a handmade cigarette," Romanian anti-organised crime prosecutors (DIICOT) said in a statement.</p>

<p>A source close to the investigation confirmed to AFP that Wiz Khalifa, together with other people, had been taken in for questioning early on Sunday.</p>

<p>Khalifa was subsequently charged, but not kept in custody, the source said.</p>

<p>The investigation into the musician is ongoing, according to prosecutors.</p>

<p>Reacting to the matter, the rapper wrote on X that he "didn't mean any disrespect" to Romania "by lighting up on stage".</p>

<p>"They were very respectful and let me go. I'll be back soon. But without a big ass joint next time," he added.</p>

<p>Khalifa often refers to the delights of marijuana in his lyrics.</p>

<p>Legal cannabis companies in the US have drawn celebrity funding or endorsements from known aficionados of marijuana like Khalifa and rapper Snoop Dogg, but also from actor Seth Rogen and former boxing champ Mike Tyson.</p>

<p>In another recent controversy rocking the music scene in Romania, US rapper Nicki Minaj earlier this month abruptly cancelled her appearance at the Saga Festival in Bucharest, citing safety concerns due to upcoming protests.</p>

<p>Accountants held a protest against changes in fiscal legislation in Romania one day after her scheduled show, but the demonstration passed peacefully.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Kremlin said on Monday that Russian President Vladimir Putin had not contacted Donald Trump after the assassination attempt on the Republican U.S. presidential candidate over the weekend and had no plans to do so.</p>

<p>Asked if security measures around Putin would now be strengthened, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the Russian leader already enjoyed the appropriate level of protection.</p>

<p>"Security is already strengthened for obvious reasons, regardless of incidents," Peskov told reporters.</p>

<p>"We can only reiterate that the security of the head of state is provided at the appropriate level, everything necessary is being done taking into account the international escalation of tensions in general."</p>

<p>The Kremlin said on Sunday it did not believe the U.S. administration was responsible for Saturday's assassination attempt on Trump, but accused it of creating an atmosphere that provoked the attack.</p>

<p>Trump was shot in the ear during a campaign rally in Pennsylvania after a major security lapse. The attacker was shot dead and law enforcement officials said they had not yet identified a motive.</p>

<p>Putin has not yet commented publicly on the matter.</p>

<p>Peskov's comments echoed those of some of Trump's Republican allies, who immediately pinned the blame on Biden.</p>

<p>"After numerous attempts to remove candidate Trump from the political arena - using first legal tools, the courts, prosecutors, attempts to politically discredit and compromise the candidate - it was obvious to all outside observers that his life was in danger," Peskov said on Sunday.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Britain's head of state King Charles III has written to former US president Donald Trump after he survived an assassination attempt, Buckingham Palace said on Monday.</p>

<p>King Charles' message was delivered on Sunday via the UK embassy in Washington, the palace said, adding that the contents would be kept private.</p>

<p>Trump -- set to be confirmed as the Republican Party's candidate in the November presidential election -- was hit in the ear by a gunman at an election rally in Pennsylvania on Saturday.</p>

<p>He was left with a bloodied face, but avoided serious injury in the incident in which one bystander died and two others were critically injured.</p>

<p>British Prime Minister Keir Starmer spoke to Trump on Sunday, expressing his condolences for the other victim and their family, and wishing the former president and the injured a quick recovery.</p>

<p>Starmer said on X, formerly Twitter, that he was "appalled by the shocking scenes" at the rally.</p>

<p>"Political violence in any form has no place in our societies," the premier said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A day after Donald Trump survived an assassination bid at his last campaign rally, the former US President Donald Trump praised the Secret Service officials for their heroic actions.</p>

<p>"They took him (shooter) out with one shot right between the eyes," he told the New York Post in an interview. "They did a fantastic job," he added.</p>

<p>"It's surreal for all of us," he said.</p>

<p>Donald Trump told the publication that he would have been dead had he not tilted his head slightly to the right to read a chart while addressing the rally.</p>

<p>"I'm not supposed to be here, I'm supposed to be dead," Trump told the New York Post.</p>

<p>Donald Trump told the New York Post that as Secret Service agents led him off stage, he still wanted to continue speaking to supporters.</p>

<p>"I just wanted to keep speaking, but I just got shot," he said.</p>

<p>The 78-year-old had just started his speech during a Saturday campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania when the shots rang out and one of the bullets grazed his ear.</p>

<p>A moment of terrifying political violence at the rally instantly turned into a piece of Donald Trump iconography that's likely to turbocharge his presidential bid.</p>

<p>Images of a defiant Trump - with his fist raised over his head and his bloody right ear, as Secret Service agents surround him and the American flag waving in the background - are blazing across social media and television.</p>

<p>He said that he was glad he didn't have to die for an iconic picture. "A lot of people say it's the most iconic photo they've ever seen. They're right, and I didn't die. Usually, you have to die to have an iconic picture," Trump told the New York Post.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[After the attempt on Donald Trump’s life during a campaign rally in Pennsylvania on Saturday, LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman has clarified his "actual martyr" remark in a post on X.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few days before the assassination attempt on Donald Trump, LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman had wished to make the former US president an "actual martyr". Hoffman has now clarified his remarks after it landed him in hot water following Saturday's shooting incident at Trump's Pennsylvania rally.</p>

<p>On social media site X, Hoffman said he was "horrified and saddened" over the fatal attack on Trump and wished him a speedy recovery.</p>

<p>Last week, attending the Allen &amp; Company Sun Valley Conference, Hoffman reportedly said that he and fellow tech entrepreneur Peter Thiel had a fallout due to a "moral issue" -- as Thiel backed Trump.</p>

<p>Thiel was present in the audience and sarcastically thanked Hoffman for putting money behind lawsuits against the former US president. He said the legal action turned Trump into a "martyr."</p>

<p>In reply, Hoffman reportedly said, "Yeah, I wish I had made him an actual martyr".</p>

<p>After the attempt on Trump's life during a campaign rally on Saturday, Hoffman has now tried to clarify his remark in a lengthy post on X.</p>

<p>"At a recent business conference, Peter Thiel said that my lawsuit against Trump was 'turning a clown into a martyr.' In that context, I replied that I wished that Trump would martyr himself - meaning let himself be held accountable - for his assaults on and lies about women," Hoffman wrote.</p>

<p>He added, "Of course, I meant nothing about any sort of physical harm or violence, which I categorically deplore. I meant and mean accountability to the rule of law, such as unanimous guilty felony verdict by 12 jurors on 34 counts and an $84 million judgment for slander and lies about his sexual assault."</p>

<p>Hoffman went on to say that there was no place for political violence in our society.</p>

<p>"Assassination is not only categorically wrong but is also the assassination of democracy. It is abhorrent that anyone has tried to assassinate President Trump. Everyone, on all sides of this election, should condemn political violence loudly and publicly," he noted.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">First and everything: There is no place for political violence in our society. Assassination is not only categorically wrong, but is also the assassination of democracy. It is abhorrent that anyone has tried to assassinate President Trump. Everyone, on all sides of this…</p>
— Reid Hoffman (@reidhoffman) <a href="https://twitter.com/reidhoffman/status/1812528484851531780?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 14, 2024</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Meanwhile, Dmitri Mehlhorn, a top Hoffman advisor, on Sunday wrote in an email to a few journalists that the Pennsylvania shooting incident "was encouraged and maybe even staged so Trump could get the photos and benefit from the backlash," according to a report in Semafor.</p>

<p>Both Hoffman and Mehlhorn donate to Democrats. Later, Mehlhorn on Sunday said that he regretted sending the email.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan's party Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf will be banned for its alleged involvement in anti-state activities, the government said Monday.</p>

<p>"The government has decided that the federal government will move a case to ban the PTI (Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf)," Information Minister Attaullah Tarar told reporters in Islamabad. The case would be taken to the Supreme Court, he added.</p>

<p>There is clear evidence to impose restrictions on the PTI and the government would initiate proceedings against the party, said Mr Tarar.</p>

<p>Mr Khan, 71, had formed PTI in 1996, which came to power in 2018. Mr Khan served as prime minister from 2018 to 2022, when he was ousted after falling out with the military establishment, which wields huge influence over civilian politics.</p>

<p>Mr Khan was banned from running in the February election due to a graft conviction.</p>

<p>Despite the setbacks, candidates loyal to PTI secured more seats than any other party, but were kept from power by the alliance pact.</p>

<p>A spokesperson for the PTI told news agency AFP that the party "will not tolerate" the government's effort to ban it.</p>

<p>"PTI has become stronger than before. We will face it," Raoof Hasan said.</p>

<p>In a landmark ruling on Friday, the Supreme Court granted the PTI more parliamentary seats, after party members were forced to run as independents in the February 8 election.</p>

<p>Mr Khan's conviction for illegal marriage -- which carried a seven-year sentence -- was then overturned by an Islamabad court on Saturday but he remains jailed over other cases.</p>

<p>A UN panel of experts found this month that Mr Khan's detention "had no legal basis and appears to have been intended to disqualify him from running for political office".</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A suspect has been charged with murder after the bodies of two men, one of whom was from France, were found dumped in suitcases on a well-known UK bridge, police said on Monday.</p>

<p>Police said the two victims had previously been in a relationship but still lived together in west London, adding that the suspect had been staying with them.</p>

<p>Evidence in the investigation so far had not pointed to a homophobic motive but it had been classified as a hate crime.</p>

<p>Police named the victims as Albert Alfonso, 62, a British citizen originally from France, and Paul Longworth, 71.</p>

<p>Officers launched a manhunt after the suitcases were discovered on Clifton Suspension Bridge in Bristol in southwest England last week.</p>

<p>More human remains were later found at a flat in London.</p>

<p>Suspect Yostin Andres Mosquera, 34, will appear before magistrates in the capital later on Monday.</p>

<p>"I know that this awful incident will cause concern not just among residents... but in the wider LGBTQ+ community across London," said Metropolitan Police Deputy Assistant Commissioner Andy Valentine, adding that officers were not looking for anyone else over the killings.</p>

<p>"My thoughts are first and foremost with Albert and Paul's loved ones who are coming to terms with this terrible news," he said.</p>

<p>The singer made history by becoming the first Punjabi artist to headline concerts in both the Canadian stadiums -- Vancouver's BC Place and Toronto's Rogers Centre, which have the seating capacity of over 54,000 and 49,000, respectively.</p>

<p>He later shared photographs and videos from his sold out performance where fans can be seen screaming and dancing with joy as he takes to stage.</p>

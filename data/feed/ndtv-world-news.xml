       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said his US counterpart Joe Biden accidentally referring to him as Russian President Vladimir Putin was a mistake that could be forgotten about given all the support the US has provided to Ukraine.</p>

<p>Biden mistakenly referred to Zelensky as Putin at a NATO summit in Washington on Thursday before correcting himself two seconds later.</p>

<p>"It's a mistake. I think the United States gave a lot of support to Ukrainians. We can forget some mistakes, I think so," Zelensky told reporters on Saturday at Ireland's Shannon airport where he was meeting Irish Prime Minister Simon Harris.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A couple in the UK have been slapped with a 1,200 pound (Rs1,30,079) fine by their local council after they tidied up the rubbish outside their home.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As responsible citizens, we should keep our streets and neighbourhoods clean by properly disposing of waste and participating in community clean-up efforts. However, in a bizarre event, a couple in the UK&nbsp;have been slapped with a 1,200 pound&nbsp; (Rs&nbsp;1,30,079) fine&nbsp;by their local council after they tidied up the rubbish outside their home, <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cldyny34kx4o">BBC</a></em> reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The couple stated that their road had been plagued with "disgusting" litter for years. Taking matters into their own hands,&nbsp;Veronika Mike and her boyfriend Zoltan Pinter, from Stoke-on-Trent, decided to clean the garbage themselves. On April 29, they&nbsp;filled a cardboard box with food remnants and discarded packaging to stop it from scattering, placing it beside the bins in hopes that the council would take it away.</p>

<p>Days later on May 8, they received a fine from the council who said that they&nbsp;had failed ''to transfer household waste to an authorised authority''.&nbsp;Instead of gratitude, both received 600-pound fines each for their efforts.</p>

<p>The letter from the council read: "This is being issued to you as you failed in your legal duty to transfer controlled waste to an authorised person. Evidence has been obtained that the items in the picture provided originated from your home address."</p>

<p>It added, ''The allegation is not that you placed the waste at the location, but that you failed in your legal duty when transferring household items. It is the legal duty of domestic households to ensure the transfer of waste to authorised persons to stop flying tipping."</p>

<p>Mr Pinter paid the fine immediately while Ms Mike is paying it off in monthly instalments of 100 pounds.&nbsp;''We just wanted to clean our street and that's the thanks we get from the council. At first, I was very angry and I cried. I have volunteered for litter picking before, and I essentially did the same thing and got two £600 penalties for nothing. For the first few years, it was OK but after that, it's always been messy in the street. The bins are in front of our main entrance, it's disgusting,'' Ms Mike said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After their experience, the couple vowed to never clean their streets again "even if the rats come".</p>

<p>They have now <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/cleaning-and-fined">started a fundraiser to help pay off the fines</a> they received for cleaning the area. They have received an outpouring of support and have collected more than 2000 pounds on GoFundMe.&nbsp;</p>

<p>City councillor Amjid Wazir said the matter was considered resolved.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Laura Cisneros told the outlet that she and Castillo never had sexual intercourse, but they did make out in a car. She has since ended the relationship.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Police Officer Mark Castillo, who serves as the personal driver and bodyguard for San Antonio Police Chief William McManus, is facing allegations of sending sex-related text messages to a married woman while on duty. According to the <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/07/12/us-news/san-antonio-police-officer-mark-castillo-llegedly-sent-racy-texts-to-married-woman-while-working-as-chiefs-body-guard/">New York Post,</a></em> he allegedly sent explicit photos of himself to a married woman as he worked on his police chief's security detail.</p>

<p>He&nbsp;allegedly sent inappropriate messages to Laura Cisneros, 50, for nearly a month between late April and May 22, often during the hours of 7 a.m. to 5 p.m., his regular work schedule.</p>

<p>Arturo Cisneros, the husband of the woman who received the texts, filed a complaint with the department's Internal Affairs Unit after discovering the messages. Notably, Mr Cisneros knew the police officer&nbsp;through his wife's connections and had encountered him at various public events, including city council meetings and a local restaurant.</p>

<p>''Mmmm, I wish I could....slowly,” the cop said in one series of texts.''Stop. And lol you're going to get me in trouble. My computer is open and they keep seeing you come up,'' Ms Cisneros wrote.&nbsp;</p>

<p>''OK, make sure to erase your messages. TTYL,'' Mr Castillo said in reply.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mr Cisneros told<em> </em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ksat.com/news/ksat-investigates/2024/07/09/member-of-mcmanus-security-team-sexted-with-woman-while-on-duty-records-show/"><em>KSAT</em> </a>that he read a month's worth of messages, which appeared to intensify sexually in the days before they were discovered. He eventually contacted family members to inform them that he had found disturbing material on his wife's phone. He then called 911 to report the affair between Mr Castillo and his wife.</p>

<p>The Internal Affairs Unit is now investigating the allegations to determine the extent of Mr Castillo's conduct and whether it violated departmental policies. Mr Castillo could face disciplinary action, which may include suspension or termination from the force.</p>

<p>Laura Cisneros told the outlet that she and Mr Castillo never had sexual intercourse, but they did make out in a car. She has since ended the relationship.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Italian police said on Saturday they had freed 33 Indian farm labourers from slave-like working conditions in the northern Verona province and seized almost half a million euros ($545,300) from their two alleged abusers.</p>

<p>Labour exploitation is in the spotlight in Italy following an accident in June in which an Indian fruit picker died after his arm was severed by machinery.</p>

<p>In the latest case, police said the alleged gang masters, also from India, brought fellow nationals to Italy on seasonal work permits, asking them to pay 17,000 euros each and promising them a better future.</p>

<p>The migrants were given farm jobs, working seven days a week and 10-12 hours a day for just 4 euros an hour, which was entirely docked from them until they settled all their debts, the police said, describing the migrants' treatment as "slavery".</p>

<p>Some were asked to continue working for free to pay an additional 13,000 euros for a permanent work permit "which, in reality, would have never been given to them," the police statement said.</p>

<p>The alleged abusers were charged with crimes connected to slavery and labour exploitation, while the victims will be offered protection, work opportunities, and legal residency papers, the police said.</p>

<p>Like other European nations, Italy has growing labour shortages often filled via immigration, particularly in lower-paid jobs, and has a migrant work visa system that has faced cases of fraud.</p>

<p>The country also has a problem with labour law violations. According to 2021 data from national statistics office Istat, about 11% of Italian workers were employed illegally, rising to more than 23% in agriculture.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Last week, his wife Andrezza De Lima posted a photo that included a distinct landmark, enabling police to pinpoint their exact location.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ronald Roland, a Brazilian drug lord, was apprehended by police after successfully evading capture for two years. Shockingly, the breakthrough in the case came from the social media activities of his wife, Andrezza De Lima, whose Instagram posts inadvertently revealed their location, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://metro.co.uk/2024/07/09/brazillian-drug-lord-arrested-wife-reveals-location-instagram-21191163/">Metro </a>reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Notably, authorities had been monitoring De Lima's social media accounts for some time, waiting for a slip that would lead them to her husband. De Lima's posts, which included geo-tagged locations and identifiable landmarks, allowed law enforcement to track their whereabouts. Her posts showcased their lavish trips to various exotic destinations like Paris, Dubai, Maldives and Colombia and provided valuable information for the authorities.</p>

<p>Last week,&nbsp;De Lima posted a photo that included a distinct landmark, enabling police to pinpoint their exact location.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He was finally captured last Tuesday at his condominium in the coastal town of Guaruja on suspicion of running a sprawling money laundering scheme and supplying drug cartels in Mexico. According to local police, the drug lord made a fortune of 860.2 million pounds in five years which he shuffled through more than 100 shell companies and businesses.</p>

<p>His wife, who was also involved in his criminal activities, used her bikini shop in Guaruja to launder money, sometimes receiving deposits that surpassed 30,000 dollars in a single day.</p>

<p>Following his capture, Roland faces multiple charges related to drug trafficking, organized crime, and evading arrest.</p>

<p>Interestingly, he was also arrested in 2019 after his ex-wife similarly revealed their location on social media.&nbsp;His ex-wife had tagged the location where the couple was in a post on social media, leading to his arrest.</p>

<p>Reports said that police began tailing Roland in 2012 when he worked as an airline pilot. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) sent a letter to Brazil's Federal Police, warning them about an investigation into a group of Brazilian pilots involved in "cocaine smuggling." Since receiving the DEA's letter, Roland became a person of interest in several Brazilian police operations targeting drug trafficking networks.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A Pakistan court overturned ex-Prime Minister Imran Khan's conviction on illegal marriage charges on Saturday, though he remains jailed over allegations of inciting riots.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Pakistan court overturned ex-Prime Minister Imran Khan's conviction on illegal marriage charges on Saturday, though he remains jailed over allegations of inciting riots.</p>

<p>Khan was slapped with a trio of convictions in the days before the February elections -- cases he says were orchestrated to prevent his return to power.</p>

<p>Those cases have now all been at least partially rolled back on appeal, with a treason conviction carrying a decade jail term overturned in April, and a 14-year graft sentence suspended in June, though the conviction still stands.</p>

<p>Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi had also been sentenced to seven years for allegedly marrying too soon after her divorce in a breach of Islamic law.</p>

<p>But Islamabad Additional District and Sessions Court judge Afzal Majoka announced Saturday that the "appeals of both Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi are accepted".</p>

<p>Khan remains locked up, though, with a spokesman for his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party saying a court in eastern Lahore had approved his arrest over three cases alleging he incited riots in May 2023.</p>

<p>Spokesman Ahmed Janjua said in a statement it was "yet another gimmick to keep the illegal imprisonment prolonged".</p>

<p><strong>Courting Controversy</strong></p>

<p>Earlier this month a UN panel of experts found Khan's detention "had no legal basis and appears to have been intended to disqualify him from running for political office".</p>

<p>"Thus, from the outset, that prosecution was not grounded in law and was reportedly instrumentalised for a political purpose," it said, calling for his immediate release after nearly a year in jail.</p>

<p>Candidates loyal to Khan won the most seats in the national election but were kept from government by an alliance of military-backed rival parties.</p>

<p>Khan served as prime minister from 2018 to 2022, when he was ousted by a no-confidence vote after falling out with the military establishment, which wields huge influence over civilian politics.</p>

<p>In opposition he waged a campaign of defiance against the top generals, who directly ruled Pakistan for decades of its history, even accusing them of an assassination attempt that wounded him.</p>

<p>But the former cricket star's comeback campaign was hobbled by scores of legal cases, which analysts say were likely brought at the behest of the military establishment.</p>

<p>Gallup Pakistan analyst Bilal Gilani said the rolling back of the cases could suggest the establishment was softening its stance on Khan after the election secured their favoured government -- or that the courts were defying their attempts to keep him confined.</p>

<p>"It is an important judgment, because essentially now there are a limited number of cases left," he told AFP.</p>

<p>"Immediate release is quite impossible, but... the chances of release are getting clearer by the day," he added.</p>

<p>Khan was first briefly arrested in May 2023, sparking nationwide unrest from PTI supporters, some of which targeted military facilities.</p>

<p>The government and military cited the attacks as justification for a sweeping crackdown on PTI, which saw its senior leadership decimated by arrests and defections.</p>

<p>An anti-terrorism court in the eastern city of Lahore on Tuesday refused to grant him bail as police investigate his alleged role in the unrest, despite the fact he was behind bars at the time.</p>

<p><strong>Surviving The Crackdown</strong></p>

<p>PTI candidates were forced to stand as independents in the February 8 elections, which had been repeatedly delayed amid political chaos.</p>

<p>Khan's arrest and conviction for graft back in August 2023 meant he was barred from standing for office himself, confined to a cell in Adiala Jail south of the capital Islamabad.</p>

<p>Despite that, candidates loyal to PTI secured more seats than any other party.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, they were blocked from power by a broad coalition of parties considered more pliable to the influence of the military.</p>

<p>Polling day itself was marred by allegations of vote-tampering amid a nationwide mobile internet blackout Islamabad said it orchestrated over security concerns.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Catherine, Princess of Wales, will attend the Wimbledon Men's final in London on Sunday as she recovers after being diagnosed with cancer, her Kensington Palace office said.</p>

<p>"The Princess of Wales, Patron of the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club will attend the Gentlemen's Singles Final of The Championships, Wimbledon on Sunday 14th July," the palace said in a press release.</p>

<p>UK media also reported that the princess will present the trophy to the winner of the final, which will see Serbian all-time great Novak Djokovic go up against defending Spanish champion Carlos Alcaraz.</p>

<p>Catherine last month tentatively returned to UK public life for the first time since her diagnosis, attending a military parade in London to mark King Charles III's official birthday.</p>

<p>The 42-year-old future queen appeared on the Buckingham Palace balcony, to cheers from the crowds below.</p>

<p>It came nearly three months after the princess revealed she was receiving chemotherapy treatment. She had not been seen at a public engagement since a Christmas Day service last year.</p>

<p>In a statement released at the time, Kate said she was "making good progress" with her treatment, which is set to last for several more months, but was "not out of the woods yet".</p>

<p>"I'm looking forward to attending the King's Birthday Parade this weekend with my family and hope to join a few public engagements over the summer," the princess added.</p>

<p>Angela Perry, a teacher in her 50s from Reading, told AFP at the event that: "She's our future queen. She's so important," calling Kate's reemergence "reassuring".</p>

<p>Kate's cancer announcement came just weeks after it was disclosed that British head of state Charles had also been diagnosed with the condition.</p>

<p>Neither has revealed what type of cancer they have.</p>

<p>Charles, 75, was given the green light to resume public duties in April after doctors said they were "very encouraged" by his progress.</p>

<p>He has since attended commemoration events in northern France for the 80th anniversary of D-Day.</p>

<p>Royal officials are keen to manage expectations about Kate's gradual return to the public eye and have maintained that her appearances will depend on her treatment and recovery.</p>

<p>Kate explained in her statement that she had "good days and bad days" and was "taking each day as it comes".</p>

<p>The King's sister, Princess Anne, took on more duties during the absences of Charles and Catherine but was herself recently put out of action after being hospitalised for five days following an incident involving a horse.</p>

<p>Anne, 73, returned to public duties on Friday, weeks after she was treated for a concussion.</p>

<p>Catherine and her husband William celebrated her return, writing on social media: "Super trooper! So great to see you back so soon!", signing it "W and C x".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An Israeli airstrike targeted Hamas' military chief Mohammed Deif in Gaza on Saturday, a security official and Israel Army Radio said, in an attack that the enclave's health ministry said had killed at least 71 Palestinians.</p>

<p>It was unclear whether Deif was killed, the security official said. Army Radio said Deif was hiding in a building in the Israeli-designated humanitarian zone Al-Mawasi, west of the southern city of Khan Younis.</p>

<p>Deif was one of the masterminds of Hamas' October 7 attack on Israel that triggered the war in Gaza. He has survived seven Israeli assassination attempts, the most recent in 2021, and has topped Israel's most-wanted list for decades.</p>

<p>The Gaza health ministry said at least 71 Palestinians had been killed in the strike and 289 injured.</p>

<p>Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant was holding special consultations, his office said, in light of "developments in Gaza". It was unclear how the strike would affect ceasefire talks underway in Doha and Cairo.</p>

<p>The Hamas-run media office said at least 100 people had been killed and wounded, including members of the Civil Emergency Service. The Israeli military said it was looking into the report.</p>

<p>A senior Hamas official did not confirm whether Deif had been present and called the Israeli allegations "nonsense".</p>

<p>"All the martyrs are civilians and what happened was a grave escalation of the war of genocide, backed by the American support and world silence," Abu Zuhri told Reuters, adding the strike showed Israel was not interested in reaching a ceasefire deal.</p>

<p><strong>Attack "Surprising", Say Witnesses</strong></p>

<p>Reuters footage showed ambulances racing towards the area amidst clouds of smoke and dust. Displaced people, including women and children, were fleeing in panic, some holding belongings in their hands.</p>

<p>Witnesses said the attack was a surprise as the area had been calm, adding more than one missile had been fired. Some of the wounded, who were being evacuated were rescue workers, they said.</p>

<p>"They're all gone, my whole family's gone.. where are my brothers? They're all gone, they're all gone. There's no one left," said one tearful woman, who did not give her name.</p>

<p>"Our children are in pieces, they are in pieces. Shame (on you)," she added.</p>

<p>Rising up the Hamas ranks over 30 years, Deif developed the group's network of tunnels and its bomb-making expertise. He is held responsible for the deaths of dozens of Israelis in suicide bombings.</p>

<p>Hamas-led militants killed 1,200 people and took more than 250 hostages in a cross-border raid into southern Israel on October 7, according to Israeli tallies.</p>

<p>Israel has retaliated by military action in Gaza that has killed more than 38,000 Palestinians, medical authorities in Gaza say.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden today signed "The Resolve Tibet Act" which states that China's ongoing occupation of Tibet must be resolved per the international law peacefully and not through repression.</p>

<p>Biden's government called on China to resume direct dialogue, without preconditions, with the Dalai Lama, or his representatives, to seek a settlement that resolves differences and leads to a negotiated agreement on Tibet.</p>

<p>The act- Promoting a Resolution to the Tibet-China Dispute Act, popularly known as the Resolve Tibet Act, states that it is American policy that the Tibet issue must be resolved in accordance with international law by peaceful means, through dialogue without preconditions.</p>

<p>"The Resolve Tibet Act cuts to the heart of China's brutal treatment of the Tibetan people," said Tencho Gyatso, President of the International Campaign for Tibet.</p>

<p>The bill sees Tibetans as people with their own religious, cultural, linguistic and historical identity. It recognises that China is suppressing the Tibetans' way of life.</p>

<p>The Dalai Lama has repeatedly called for China to grant genuine autonomy to the Tibetan people, and it is clear under international law that people are entitled to self-determination. When House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Michael McCaul (R-TX) spoke before it passed Congress, he expressed his hopes that the new law will help "put the people of Tibet in charge of their future."</p>

<p>The law promotes a resolution of the dispute between Tibet and China. It empowers Tibet to counter disinformation about Tibet from the Chinese government. Rejects as "inaccurate" China's false claims that Tibet has been part of China since "ancient times."</p>

<p>It promotes dialogue between China and the Dalai Lama without preconditions.<br />
The US can also 'explore activities to improve prospects' to lead a negotiated agreement on Tibet, including coordination with other countries, to bring a negotiated agreement on Tibet.</p>

<p>The Central Tibetan Administration welcomed the agreement.</p>

<p>In a post on X, the Tibetan Administration said, "BREAKING NEWS: Resolve Tibet Act, is now a law after US President Joe Biden signed on 12 July 2024. It helps the US counter misinformation from the PRC and support the rights of Tibetans."</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A two-year-old girl died on Tuesday after spending several hours alone in a hot car. Parker Scholtes was the victim's identity, as given by the Marana Police Department. Parker's father, Christopher Scholtes, 37, reportedly told authorities that she slept out in the back seat of the car when she got home.</p>

<p>Temperatures in Marana soared to 109 degrees Fahrenheit (42.7 degrees Celsius) that day.</p>

<p>Emergency responders were called to the Scholtes residence on Tuesday afternoon after Parker was found unresponsive in the vehicle. Despite medical intervention, the child was pronounced dead at the scene.</p>

<p>According to a release by <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.maranaaz.gov/police-press-releases-roll/2024/7/10/child-death-investigation-arrest?fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAR3KdzIQ2eY2musNFytTbUT5USpHI2SJ9sFHNK8uSDBkmfKNpCcsawoUIx4_aem_e3f_pFfgjmhFgEfhZRGFvA">the police department,</a> "during the initial investigation, the father, identified as 37-year-old Christopher Scholtes, told officers he arrived home, and the 2-year-old girl was still asleep in the vehicle in her car seat. He left the vehicle on and was running in the driveway, with the air conditioning on and the child inside. Christopher told detectives he did not want to wake his daughter up so she could continue sleeping in the vehicle. Christopher then went inside the residence. The mother was not home, but shortly after she arrived, the child was discovered in the vehicle, which was no longer running, and the air conditioning was off. 9-1-1 was called, and the mother performed CPR until NWFD and MPD arrived. NWFD performed life-saving measures, and the child was transported to Banner University Medical Center. Unfortunately, the child was pronounced dead."</p>

<p>Marana Police Detectives were granted a search warrant the night of the incident and conducted a thorough investigation. During the investigation, detectives obtained video surveillance from nearby residences and determined that the child had been in the vehicle for approximately three hours.</p>

<p>On July 12 at 8:38 AM, Christopher Scholtes was arrested and booked into the Pima County Adult Detention Centre for 2nd Degree Murder and Child Abuse related to this tragic event.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees said Friday it had enough funds to continue operating through September, following a pledging conference for the embattled body where UN chief Antonio Guterres pleaded for help from donors.</p>

<p>"We have worked tirelessly with partners to restore confidence in the agency," UNRWA chief Philippe Lazzarini said, after several nations withheld funding following Israeli allegations in January that a number of UNRWA's employees participated in the October 7 attack by Hamas.</p>

<p>Lazzarini said new pledges of funds would help ensure emergency operations until September.</p>

<p>Guterres had pleaded with donors to fund the embattled UN agency, warning that Palestinians would lose a "critical lifeline" without UNRWA.</p>

<p>"Let me be clear -- there is no alternative to UNRWA," he said.</p>

<p>"Just when we thought it couldn't get any worse in Gaza -- somehow, appallingly, civilians are being pushed into ever deeper circles of hell," Guterres added.</p>

<p>According to Guterres, 195 UNRWA staff members have been killed in the war, the highest death toll for staff in UN history.</p>

<p>The US Congress has barred further funding for UNRWA. President Joe Biden's administration has instead directed funding for Palestinian civilians to other bodies while saying that UNRWA is uniquely equipped to distribute aid.</p>

<p>The war started with Hamas's October attack on southern Israel, which resulted in the deaths of 1,195 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.</p>

<p>Israel responded with a military offensive that has killed at least 38,345 people in Gaza, also mostly civilians, according to the health ministry in Hamas-ruled Gaza.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>UK police on Saturday arrested a man after two suitcases believed to contain the remains of two men were dumped on a famous bridge.</p>

<p>The suitcases were discovered Wednesday after police got a report of a man behaving suspiciously on the Clifton Suspension Bridge in Bristol, southwest England.</p>

<p>"Detectives have arrested a man in connection with an investigation into the discovery of human remains on Clifton Suspension Bridge," said Metropolitan Police.</p>

<p>The 24-year-old suspect was detained in Bristol and will be taken to London for questioning later on Saturday.</p>

<p>"Police are not looking for anyone else in connection with the incident," they said.</p>

<p>Metropolitan Police said the victims have not been formally identified, but both are believed to be men.</p>

<p>The London-based force took over the investigation after evidence suggested that the wanted man had travelled to Bristol from the UK capital earlier on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Clifton Suspension Bridge, designed by the pioneering engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel, is one of the oldest surviving suspension bridges in the world.</p>

<p>Opened in 1864, the bridge over the Avon Gorge is one of Bristol's top tourist attractions and a symbol of the city.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nepali rescue teams resumed their search early Saturday for at least 63 people missing after monsoon rains triggered a landslide that swept two buses off a highway and into a river.</p>

<p>The force of Friday's landslide in central Chitwan district pushed the vehicles over concrete crash barriers and down a steep embankment, at least 30 metres (100 feet) from the road.</p>

<p>Dozens of rescuers spent hours struggling to comb the raging Trishuli river, an effort hampered by muddy waters and fierce currents, before sunset forced them to call off the search.</p>

<p>No sign of the vehicles or their occupants has yet been found.</p>

<p>"We will search all possible places," Chitwan district chief Indra Dev Yadav told AFP.</p>

<p>"We will employ all our abilities for search and rescue despite the water levels, current and the water's muddiness."</p>

<p>District official Khimananda Bhusal told AFP on Friday that the buses were carrying at least 66 people between them, but three passengers had been able to escape and were treated at a local hospital.</p>

<p>The accident happened before dawn along the Narayanghat-Mugling highway, around 100 kilometres (60 miles) west of Kathmandu.</p>

<p>One bus was heading from the capital to Gaur in Rautahat district in southern Nepal, and the other was en route to Kathmandu from southern Birgunj.</p>

<p>A driver was killed in a separate accident on the same road after a boulder hit his bus. He died as he was being treated at a hospital.</p>

<p>Deadly crashes are common in the Himalayan republic because of poorly constructed roads, badly maintained vehicles and reckless driving.</p>

<p>Nearly 2,400 people lost their lives on Nepal's roads in the 12 months to April, according to government figures.</p>

<p>Twelve people were killed and 24 injured in an accident in January when a bus heading to Kathmandu from Nepalgunj fell into a river.</p>

<p>Road travel becomes deadlier during the annual monsoon season as rains trigger landslides and floods across the mountainous country.</p>

<p>Monsoon rains across South Asia from June to September offer respite from the summer heat and are crucial to replenishing water supplies, but also bring widespread death and destruction.</p>

<p>The rainfall is hard to forecast and varies considerably, but scientists say climate change is making the monsoon stronger and more erratic.</p>

<p>Floods, landslides and lightning strikes have killed 88 people across the country since the monsoon began in June, according to police figures.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden has made numerous verbal stumbles and gaffes over the years. From verbal slip-ups to near-fall incidents, Mr Biden, whose age is often targeted by opposition leaders and remains a concern for voters, has had all. The 81-year-old has given hearty laughs to many and has shocked others with his blunder-prone personality. Now, with US elections just around the corner, questions about the US President's fitness to serve four more years - or win November's election - continue to swirl. However, despite growing concerns about his mental sharpness and candidacy, Mr Biden has repeatedly doubled down on staying in the race. He has asserted that he was the "most qualified" to both defeat the presumptive Republican nominee, Donald Trump and govern the country.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But there is no question that Mr Biden's age is a cause of particular concern to voters. Republican underdog Nikki Haley has repeatedly tried to draw attention to the advanced ages of her competitors. In a recent interview she also jokingly said that President Biden's South Carolina primary vote count would also serve as a fine campaign slogan: "Very close to 100."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Donald Trump, on the other hand, has also worked hard to suggest that his rival is too old, warning at one stage that Mr Biden's propensity for gaffes could lead to nuclear war and referring to him as a "guy who can't put two sentences together". Mr Trump recently also posted a spoof commercial for "White House Senior Living" on social media.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, Joe Biden has fought back, producing his own gaffe reel of bizarre remarks Mr Trump has made at his campaign rallies.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Still, there is no denying that Mr Biden has made more than his fair share of mistakes and blunders over the years. From mixing up European leaders to misidentifying his own Vice President Kamala Harris at a recent press conference, the 81-year-old has made many mistakes during statements, speeches or public comments. In some instances, White House staff have also had to make corrections to official transcripts in order to align the president's words with public policy stances or to change the meaning of his statements entirely, according to a report from AFP.</p>

<h3><strong>Here are some of the US President's gaffes over recent years:&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<h2><strong>Joe Biden's gaffe with Ukraine leader</strong></h2>

<p>While speaking to reporters about NATO's support for Ukraine earlier this week, the 81-year-old raised eyebrows by mistakenly referring to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky as "President Putin" in front of the assembled world leaders.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"And now I want to hand it over to the President of Ukraine, who has shown as much courage as he has determination. Ladies and gentlemen, President Putin," Mr Biden said during the speech. However, he quickly realised his mistake and apologised. But the embarrassing moment was witnessed by everyone present, with the President explaining that it occurred because he was "so focused on beating" the Kremlin leader.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Referring to Kamala Harris as "Vice President Trump"</strong></h2>

<p>At the same conference, when he was asked about his Vice President Kamala Harris, he mistakenly called her "vice president Trump". "Look, I wouldn't have picked vice president Trump to be vice president if she was not qualified to be president. So start there," he said.</p>

<p>Moreover, the 81-year-old also struggled to find the words "chief of staff," mistakenly referring to the group of the country's top uniformed military leaders as "commander in chief" - the title he holds as president.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Mistaking Egypt for Mexico</strong></h2>

<p>In February this year, Mr Biden appeared to confuse Egypt with Mexico while referring to the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict in the Middle East. "The president of Mexico did not want to open up the gate to allow humanitarian material to get in," he said. "I talked to him. I convinced to open the gate," he added.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Confusing world leaders&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p>In the same month, the US President mistakenly claimed to have met Francois Mitterand, who died in 1996, at the G7 summit in 2021. "Mitterrand from Germany - I mean, from France - looked at me and said, 'You know, what... why... how long you back for?" President Biden told his puzzled listeners.</p>

<p>The same week, he also said that he said that he had spoken to German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who died in 2017, about the January 6 riots, which happened in 2021. He was thinking of Angela Merkel.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Forgetting the name of Hamas</strong></h2>

<p>In February, Mr Biden appeared unable to recall Hamas' name while speaking at a press conference. He was asked a question about the hostage negotiations between Israel and Hamas.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"There is some movement, and I don't wanna, I don't wanna ...," the 81-year-old said, and then paused. "Let me choose my words - there's some movement, there's been ... a response from the, uh...."</p>

<p>"There's been a response ... from ... the opposition, but, um -" Mr Biden said. He sounded confused about what he meant to say, eventually stating after some guidance, "Yes, I'm sorry, from Hamas."</p>

<h2><strong>Tripping on the steps to Air Force One</strong></h2>

<p>In July 2023, Joe Biden stumbled awkwardly on the stairs of Air Force One. He was walking up to board the presidential plane in Finland when he stumbled. "About half way up he appeared to stumble very slightly but kept walking on up. He turned to wave to the staff out on the tarmac and went in," the <em>Independent </em>reported.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Muddling up the wars in Ukraine and Iraq&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p>Last year, the US President muddled up the ongoing war in Ukraine with the Iraq war, which ended in 2011. He was speaking to reporters on the South Lawn of the White House before heading to Chicago when he was asked whether he believed Russian President Vladimir Putin had been weakened by the Wagner Group's mutiny that summer.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mr Biden responded by saying that President Putin was "clearly losing the war in Iraq".&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>"God save the Queen"</strong></h2>

<p>In 2023, Mr Biden also made another verbal gaffe when he bizarrely closed out a speech on gun control with the proclamation: "God save the Queen, man". The slip-up raised eyebrows and provoked confusion over whether he had been referring to UK's Queen Elizabeth II, who died in September 2022, or King Charles III's wife Queen Camilla, who had just been crowned a month earlier at a grand coronation ceremony in London.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The White House, however, later sought to explain away the bizarre reference by saying that he was merely "commenting to someone in the crowd".</p>

<h2><strong>Biden's gaffe with former UK PM Rishi Sunak&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p>When Mr Biden hosted Rishi Sunak as UK Prime Minister at White House in June 2023, he accidentally addressed him as "Mr President". As they smiled and posed for photos, the 81-year-old said, "Well, Mr President..."&nbsp;</p>

<p>He then quickly corrected himself and joked, "I just demoted you, Mr Prime Minister".&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Gaffe about Ireland</strong></h2>

<p>Last year, Mr Biden confused the name of the New Zealand All Blacks rugby team with the reviled British paramilitary force, the Black and Tans, during a visit to Ireland. " "See this tie I have, this shamrock tie? It was given to me by one of these guys right here, who's a hell of a rugby player who beat the hell out of the Black and Tans," he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He then corrected himself during the speech and the White House later said it was "very clear" to Irish rugby fans the president was referring to the New Zealand rugby team.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Napping at COP26&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p>In a viral video, the 81-year-old was caught sleeping on the job at the COP26 climate change conference in Scotland in 2021. In the video, Mr Biden was seen appearing to doze off during the opening remarks of the climate summit, with his eyes shit at one point for more than 20 seconds. An aide was seen popping over and nudging him awake.</p>

<h2><strong>Biden falling off a bicycle&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p>In 2022, Mr Biden fell off a bicycle near his Delaware beach home, moments after greeting reporters with a wave and a cheery "Good morning!" Asked what caused the fall, he said that the "toe cages" on his bike got caught.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Shaking hands with thin air&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p>In 2022, a video of US President Joe Biden appearing to turn to shake someone's hand after a speech left the internet puzzled. There was no one on the stage beside him at North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University in Greensboro where he delivered a 40-minute speech.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The 81-year-old finished his speech, then turned right with his hand stretched out in a handshake position. But there was no one on stage who could respond to the US President's gesture.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ireland is set to follow the UK's lead in banning this controversial breed by outlawing XL bully dogs, according to the <em>BBC. </em>The Irish Department of Rural and Community Development announced the ban, which will take effect in October of this year and prohibit the sale, donation, abandonment, and breeding of these canines.</p>

<p>Owning an XL bully will also be prohibited starting February 1, 2025, unless the current owners receive a "Certificate of Exemption."</p>

<p>According to the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgxqn2q2kzeo"><em>News Outlet,</em></a> Minister Heather Humphreys said the ban was in the "interest of public safety following a number of recent horrific attacks by XL bullies, which included the death of a young woman, Nicole Morey, in Limerick."</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/woman-mauled-to-death-by-her-own-xl-bully-dogs-at-home-in-london-5710634"><strong>Also Read | Woman Mauled To Death By Her Own XL Bully Dogs At Home In East London</strong></a></p>

<p>In March, Ms Humphreys established the group to examine dog control issues, chaired by a former senior garda (Irish police officer).</p>

<p>Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Simon Harris has also previously said he would like to see a ban and that there was a "clear need" for government action.</p>

<p><strong>What is an XL bully?</strong></p>

<p>The largest breed of bully dog in America is the XL bully. <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/ban-on-xl-bully-dogs#full-publication-update-history">The UK Department for Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs </a>states that this breed is a variation of the larger American bully. They are characterised as big dogs with a blocky head and muscular physique that show considerable strength and power relative to their size. In England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland, there are stringent laws governing the ownership of XL bullies.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p>

<p>The International Monetary Fund said it reached a new $7 billion loan deal with Pakistan in a bid to bolster its faltering economy.</p>

<p>Islamabad agreed in exchange to conduct further unpopular reforms, including widening the South Asian nation's chronically low tax base.</p>

<p>Pakistan last year came to the brink of default as the economy shrivelled amid political chaos, catastrophic 2022 monsoon floods and decades of mismanagement -- as well as the global economic downturn.</p>

<p>The nation was saved by last-minute loans from friendly countries, as well as support from the IMF, but its finances remain in dire straits with high inflation and staggering public debts.</p>

<p>The new three-year deal, which still needs approval by the IMF Executive Board, should enable Pakistan to "cement macroeconomic stability and create conditions for stronger, more inclusive and resilient growth", it said in a statement Friday.</p>

<h2>Dealing with a downturn</h2>

<p>Islamabad wrangled for months with IMF officials to unlock the new loan -- its 24th payout from the lender in more than six decades.</p>

<p>It came on condition of far-reaching reforms, most notably increasing the chronically low tax base.</p>

<p>In a nation of over 240 million people and where most jobs are in the informal sector, only 5.2 million filed income tax returns in 2022.</p>

<p>During the 2024-25 fiscal year which started at the beginning of July, the government aims to raise nearly $46 billion in taxes, a 40 percent increase from the previous year.</p>

<p>More unusual methods have seen the tax authority block 210,000 SIM cards of mobile users who have not filed tax returns in a bid to widen the revenue bracket.</p>

<p>Islamabad also aims to reduce its fiscal deficit by 1.5 percent to 5.9 percent in the coming year, heeding another key IMF demand.</p>

<p>But Pakistan's public debt remains huge at $242 billion and servicing it will still swallow up half of the government's income in 2024, according to the IMF.</p>

<p>Analysts have criticised Islamabad's measures as surface-level reforms -- aimed at courting the IMF without addressing underlying problems.</p>

<p>"It is hard to not see old patterns in this new IMF deal," Ali Hasanain, associate professor of economics at the Lahore University of Management Sciences, told AFP.</p>

<p>"The IMF has issued a loan similar in size and conditions as the one agreed to five years ago, and five years before that."</p>

<p>"Will authorities seize the opportunity thus created to embark on fundamental reforms to how the country is run?" he asked. "You would be well-advised not to hold your breath."</p>

<h2>Public backlash</h2>

<p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif came to power in February elections marred by allegations of rigging -- with ex-prime minister Imran Khan jailed and barred from running.</p>

<p>The diet of strict economic measures introduced by his shaky coalition government is likely to undermine their popularity.</p>

<p>There have already been scattered protests over tax and bill hikes introduced in last month's budget -- prepared with IMF oversight -- and more demonstrations are scheduled for the coming weeks.</p>

<p>While around 40 percent of the population already lives below the poverty line, the World Bank said in April it feared that 10 million additional Pakistanis would fall below this threshold.</p>

<p>Pakistan's last $3 billion loan from the IMF in 2023 proved a lifeline.</p>

<p>But it also came on the condition of unpopular austerity measures, including an end to subsidies cushioning consumer costs.</p>

<p>In recent months, the current account balance has recovered slightly and high inflation has started to subside.</p>

<p>The IMF anticipates two percent growth this year, with inflation still expected to reach nearly 25 percent year-on-year, before gradually coming down in 2025 and 2026.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russian Defence Minister Andrei Belousov and his US counterpart Lloyd Austin held a telephone call where they discussed lowering the risk of "possible escalation", the Russian defence ministry said on Friday.</p>

<p>The call, which was initiated by Moscow, comes as tensions between the two sides flare over Washington's plan to deploy long-range missiles in Germany, a decision the Kremlin warned could spell a return to Cold War-style confrontation.</p>

<p>"The issue of preventing security threats and reducing the risk of possible escalation was discussed," Russia's defence ministry said in a statement on the talks.</p>

<p>According to Deputy Pentagon Press Secretary Sabrina Singh, Austin "emphasized the importance of maintaining lines of communication" during the conversation.</p>

<p>The two sides have managed to organise sporadic phone calls despite raging tensions over the conflict in Ukraine, including a recent call at the end of June where Moscow chided Washington's arms supplies to Kyiv.</p>

<p>The White House announced on Wednesday during a NATO summit that it would station long-range weapons including Tomahawk cruise missiles in Germany as a deterrent.</p>

<p>The Kremlin criticised the move, accusing Washington of taking a step towards a new "Cold War" and of directly participating in the conflict in Ukraine.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The three-bedroom condo spans 3,601 square feet and features stunning city views, a swimming pool, and a sauna.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>King Charles III has reportedly acquired a luxurious condo unit in Manhattan's prestigious Billionaires' Row. According to city finance records, the unit was sold for $6.63 million and is located in the landmarked Steinway Hall portion of the development.</p>

<p>The move is being seen as the monarch bridging the gap between him and estranged royal Prince Harry, his son, who now resides in US's California.&nbsp;However, King Charles' estate is located far from Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's residence in Montecito, California.</p>

<p>They settled in California after leaving their duties as working members of the Royal Family in 2020. The couple has two children, Archie and Lilibet, and live on the former estate of Riven Rock, Montecito, which they purchased in 2020.<br />
<br />
The deed lists the buyer as "His Majesty the King in Right of Canada," and the purchase was made through the Canadian consulate in New York, with Robert McCubbing, senior trade commissioner and director of trade and investment, signing the deed on the King's behalf.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Mr McCubbing said the purchase was “for use as the Official Residence for the Consulate General of Canada in New York,” as per the <a href="http://https://nypost.com/2024/07/11/real-estate/king-charles-buys-luxe-nyc-condo-on-billionaires-row/ ">NY Post</a>.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The luxury condo boasts three bedrooms, 4.5 bathrooms, and 3,601 square feet of living space, complete with stunning city views, a swimming pool and a sauna. The unit starts with an elegant foyer featuring stone floors and a powder room off to the side. It opens out to a spacious living room and a dining room adjacent to it.<br />
<br />
The custom kitchen is finished with high-end materials, including Cristallo Gold quartzite countertops, custom hand-crafted cabinetry and a full suite of Gaggenau appliances. A study opposite the foyer includes an ensuite bathroom. The primary bedroom has a walk-in closet, a windowed bathroom made of Italian white Venato marble, a free-standing copper soaking tub and custom bronze fixtures.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The building amenities are equally impressive, with an 82-foot two-lane swimming pool, private cabanas, a separate sauna and treatment rooms, a double-height fitness centre with a mezzanine terrace, a private dining room and chef's catering kitchen and a residents' lounge with a vast terrace. The property is one of 60 residences in the Billionaires' Row complex, with a stunning view of Central Park from the adjacent 91-story tower.<br />
<br />
The couple has two children, Archie and Lilibet, and live on the former estate of Riven Rock, Montecito, which they purchased in 2020.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Meta said Friday it was lifting restrictions on US presidential candidate Donald Trump's Facebook and Instagram accounts, ending measures put in place after his supporters violently stormed the US Capitol in 2021.</p>

<p>It said that "former President Trump, as the nominee of the Republican Party, will no longer be subject to the heightened suspension penalties."</p>

<p>Trump's Facebook and Instagram accounts were suspended indefinitely a day after his supporters attacked the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, and it was determined he had praised people engaged in violence on social media.</p>

<p>His accounts were reinstated in February 2023 but with a threat of penalties for future breaches -- an additional restriction that Meta lifted on Friday.</p>

<p>"In assessing our responsibility to allow political expression, we believe that the American people should be able to hear from the nominees for President on the same basis," Meta wrote in a blog post.</p>

<p>It added that US presidential candidates "remain subject to the same Community Standards as all Facebook and Instagram users, including those policies designed to prevent hate speech and incitement to violence."</p>

<p>Trump, the first former president to be convicted of a crime, was also banned from Twitter and YouTube.</p>

<p>While those restrictions were later lifted last year, Trump now mainly communicates on his own social media platform, Truth Social.</p>

<p>His Facebook profile, which has 34 million users, includes messages originally published on Truth Social as well as invitations to rallies and videos from his campaign.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID) is responsible for recurring waves of infection as it continues to evolve and mutate into new variants which keep it a step ahead of our immunity.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We're in the midst of a bad cold and flu season <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-06-21/flu-whooping-cough-rsv-cases-up-as-covid-cases-unkown/104002964">in Australia</a>. Along with the usual viral suspects, such as influenza, RSV, and rhinoviruses (which cause the common cold), bacterial pathogens are also causing significant rates of illness, particularly in children. These include <em>Bordatella pertussis</em> (<a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-07-01/whooping-cough-epidemic-cases-surging-australia-superbug-vaccine/104023220">whooping cough</a>) and <em><a href="https://www.health.vic.gov.au/health-advisories/increase-in-mycoplasma-pneumoniae-infections-in-victoria">Mycoplasma pneumoniae</a></em>.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID) is responsible for recurring waves of infection as it continues to evolve and mutate into new variants which keep it a step ahead of our immunity.</p>

<p>The latest variant is nicknamed “FLuQE”, and is reportedly <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-07-03/covid-flirt-fluqe-new-variant-cases-rise-australia-us-uk/104035534">gaining traction</a> in Australia and other countries. So what is there to know about FLuQE?</p>

<h2>From FLiRT to FLuQE</h2>

<p>In recent months, you may have heard of the “<a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/2024/what-to-know-about-covid-flirt-variants">FLiRT</a>” subvariants. These are decedents of the <a href="https://theconversation.com/the-emergence-of-jn-1-is-an-evolutionary-step-change-in-the-covid-pandemic-why-is-this-significant-220285">Omicron variant JN.1</a>, including KP.1.1, KP.2 and JN.1.7.</p>

<p>KP.2, in particular, significantly contributed to COVID infections <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-05-24/covid-cases-rising-australia-flirt-variant/103883574">in Australia</a> and <a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/2024/what-to-know-about-covid-flirt-variants">elsewhere</a> around May.</p>

<p>The name FLiRT refers to the amino acid substitutions in the spike protein (<a href="https://theconversation.com/as-covid-cases-rise-again-what-do-i-need-to-know-about-the-new-flirt-variants-230423">F456L, V1104L and R346T</a>). Amino acids are the molecular building blocks of proteins, and the spike protein is the protein on the surface of SARS-CoV-2 which allows it to attach to our cells. These changes in the spike protein arise from mutation – random changes in the genetic code of the virus.</p>

<p>SARS-CoV-2's goal is to select mutations that produce a spike protein that binds strongly to our cells' receptors to support efficient infection (sometimes called viral fitness) while avoiding neutralising antibodies in our immune system (immune pressure).</p>

<p>The FLiRT mutations seem to reduce the ability of neutralising antibodies to bind to the spike protein, potentially enabling the virus to better evade our immunity. But at the same time, it appears the immune pressure which has selected for these mutations may have affected the ability of the virus to bind to our cells.</p>

<p>These <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11142104/">findings</a> are yet to be peer-reviewed (independently verified by other researchers). However, they suggest the FLiRT variants may have traded in some ability to infect our cells for a spike protein that's more resistant to our immune system.</p>

<p>According to experts <a href="https://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/fluqe-coronavirus-mutation-contributing-to-sicker-than-normal-winter-experts-say/o1oiybsjz">in Australia</a> and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/williamhaseltine/2024/05/31/analyzing-the-emergence-of-covid-variant-kp2-and-its-potential-impact/">internationally</a>, what appears to have occurred with FLuQE is an additional mutation has restored fitness that may have been lost with the FLiRT mutations.</p>

<p>FLuQE (KP.3) is a direct descendant of FLiRT, meaning it has inherited the same mutations as the FLiRT variants. But it has an additional amino acid change in the spike protein, Q493E (giving FLuQE its name).</p>

<p>This means the <a href="https://tactnowinfo.substack.com/p/covid-shifting-tides-the-emergence">amino acid glutamine</a> at position 493 has changed to glutamic acid (the spike protein is <a href="https://theconversation.com/as-covid-cases-rise-again-what-do-i-need-to-know-about-the-new-flirt-variants-230423">1,273 amino acids long</a>). Glutamine is a neutral amino acid, whereas glutamic acid has a negative charge, which changes the properties of the spike protein. This could improve the ability of the virus to infect our cells.</p>

<p>It's still early days for FLuQE and we don't have peer-reviewed research on this yet. But it appears we now have (another) immune evasive virus that is also well adapted to infecting our cells. It's no surprise, then, that FLuQE seems to be becoming dominant in <a href="https://x.com/Mike_Honey_/status/1810663232140697812">many countries</a>.</p>

<h2>What next?</h2>

<p>We would expect with widespread transmission of and infection with FLiRT and FLuQE variants, population immunity to these variants will mature, and in time, their dominance will be supplanted by the next immune-evasive variant.</p>

<p>The tug of war between our immune system and SARS-CoV-2 evolution continues. The issue we are dealing with now is vaccines don't sufficiently protect from infection or suppress virus transmission. While they're very good at protecting against severe disease, the virus still infects lots of people.</p>

<p>As well as the burden on people and health care, lots of infections means more opportunities for the virus to evolve. The more “rolls of the dice” the virus has to find a mutation that helps it evade our immune system and infect our cells, the more likely it is to do so.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Next-generation vaccines and therapies really need to boost immunity in the upper respiratory tract (nose and throat) to reduce infection and transmission. This is where infection initiates. A <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07575-x">human challenge study</a>, where volunteers are experimentally exposed to SARS-CoV-2, showed people who didn't become infected had a robust anti-viral immune response in their upper respiratory tract.</p>

<p>To this end, there are immune-stimulating nasal sprays and <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-45348-2">nasal vaccines</a> in clinical development. The hope is this approach will slow down the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 and the emergence of new subvariants that continue to drive waves of infection and disease.</p>

<p>Fortunately, so far these mutations have not generated a virus that is obviously more pathogenic (causes worse disease), but there are no guarantees this won't happen in the future.<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russia came under fire at the UN Security Council on Tuesday for conducting "systemic attacks" on Ukraine's medical facilities after a wave of deadly strikes across the country.</p>

<p>President Volodymyr Zelensky said 38 people across Ukraine were killed -- including four children -- and 190 wounded in the wave of nearly 40 missiles that targeted several towns and cities on Monday, damaging medical facilities.</p>

<p>"Intentionally directing attacks against a protected hospital is a war crime and perpetrators must be held to account," Joyce Msuya, acting under-secretary for humanitarian affairs, told the emergency meeting.</p>

<p>"These incidents are part of a deeply concerning pattern of systemic attacks harming healthcare and other civilian infrastructure across Ukraine," Msuya added.</p>

<p>Kyiv said a children's hospital was struck by a Russian cruise missile with components produced in NATO member countries, and announced a day of mourning in the capital.</p>

<p>"First Responders attending the scene immediately after the attack found children receiving treatment for cancer in hospital beds, set up in parks and on the street, where medical workers had quickly established triage areas," Msuya said.</p>

<p>Ukrainian ally France's envoy Nicolas de Riviere said "Russia has deliberately targeted residential neighborhoods and healthcare infrastructure."&nbsp;</p>

<p>"France condemns these flagrant violations of international law, which are yet another entry and note list of war crimes for which Russia will be held accountable," he said.</p>

<h3>'<strong>Abominable' attacks</strong></h3>

<p>China, which has long called for a negotiated settlement between Russia and Ukraine, said that both sides should "show political will, meet each other halfway and start peace talks at an early date."</p>

<p>"China will continue to actively promote peace talks," said Beijing's envoy Fu Cong.</p>

<p>Russia previously claimed the extensive missile damage in Kyiv was caused by Ukrainian air defense systems.</p>

<p>"We continue to insist that we do not strike civilian targets," spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters in a daily briefing Tuesday.</p>

<p>However, the United Nations said there was a "high likelihood" that the children's hospital in Kyiv suffered "a direct hit" from a missile "launched by the Russian Federation."</p>

<p>Russia currently holds the rotating presidency of the Security Council and its envoy to the United Nations, Vasily Nebenzya, indicated earlier this month he will take a firm line with Ukraine and its Western allies.</p>

<p>As a permanent member of the UN's top security body, Moscow wields a veto which it has used on several occasions to thwart efforts to censure its war in Ukraine.</p>

<p>It initially appeared that Russia would seek to block Ukraine from participating in Tuesday's meeting after Nebenzya said Kyiv had not correctly formatted its letter requesting to participate.</p>

<p>Ukraine could participate "only on condition it was requested by the United States... we regret that Ukraine cannot act independently... (and) it has to be led by its sponsor," said Nebenzya.</p>

<p>"Mr President, we are appalled by the strikes on Ukraine by the country that you are representing," Slovenia's representative to the UN Samuel Zbogar said to Nebenzya, calling the strikes "brutal" and "another low."</p>

<p>UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres described the deadly Russian strikes in Ukraine as "particularly shocking," his spokesman Stephane Dujarric said on Monday.</p>

<p>UN rights chief Volker Turk echoed Guterres, calling the attacks "abominable," and saying that "the strikes severely damaged the intensive care, surgical and oncology wards of Okhmatdyt, which is Ukraine's largest children's referral hospital."</p>

<p>Zelensky has been urging allies to bolster Ukrainian air defense systems and was expected to renew those calls as a NATO summit kicked off later Tuesday in Washington.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[India said on Tuesday that Moscow has agreed to begin discharging its citizens who were "misled" into serving in the Russian army following talks between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Vladimir Putin.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>India said on Tuesday that Moscow has agreed to begin discharging its citizens who were "misled" into serving in the Russian army following talks between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Vladimir Putin.</p>

<p>Here is a look at the problem and how the countries thrashed out a solution.</p>

<h3><strong>How Were Indians Misled Into Joining Russian Army?</strong></h3>

<p>A human trafficking network extending from New Delhi to Tamil Nadu used social media platforms and local agents to lure people to Russia by offering them lucrative jobs or admission to what Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) called "dubious private universities".</p>

<p>Once they reached Russia, however, the victims' passports were taken and they were trained in combat roles before being deployed at the front.</p>

<p>Police have arrested at least four people involved in the racket.</p>

<h3><strong>How Many People Were Lured?</strong></h3>

<p>The government estimates between 30 and 40 Indian citizens are currently serving in the Russian army.</p>

<p>At least four people have been killed in the conflict.</p>

<h3><strong>How Did India Tackle The Problem?</strong></h3>

<p>India has said that every case brought to its attention is being "strongly taken up" with Russia to ensure the "early discharge" of stranded people, and 10 Indians have been brought back as part of this effort so far.</p>

<p>Russia has not commented on the issue and has not responded to Reuters' requests for comment.</p>

<h3><strong>Have Other Countries Made Similar Allegations?</strong></h3>

<p>Nepal has said that several of its youth were similarly illegally recruited, estimating the number to be as high as 200, and stopped issuing permits for work in Russia and Ukraine in January.</p>

<p>Sri Lanka also said that several of its war veterans were lured to the Russia-Ukraine war with false promises, at least 37 of whom have been wounded and a "significant number" killed.</p>

<p>While Nepal has an agreement with India and Britain that allows its citizens to serve in their armies, Sri Lankans are not permitted to fight in armies of foreign nations.</p>

<h3><strong>What Kind Of Relationship Do India And Russia Share?</strong></h3>

<p>India has had a close relationship with Russia since the days of the Soviet Union and has emerged as the biggest buyer of its oil after 2022, when Europe banned Russian oil imports.</p>

<p>India has also refused to condemn the Ukraine war, instead calling for peace through dialogue and diplomacy.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday departed for Austria after a fruitful two-day visit to Russia during which the two countries discussed ways to further shore up bilateral cooperation in sectors such as energy, trade, manufacturing and fertilisers.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Modi on Monday began a high-profile visit to Russia to hold the 22nd India-Russia annual summit with President Vladimir Putin, in his first trip since the start of Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.</p>

<p>Last night, the Russian president hosted a private dinner for the Indian prime minister at the former's residence on the outskirts of Moscow.</p>

<p>The Ukraine conflict also came up during Modi's talks with Putin. Modi told Putin that a solution to the Ukraine conflict is not possible on the battlefield and that peace talks do not succeed amidst bombs, guns and bullets.</p>

<p>Earlier in the day, President Putin thanked Prime Minister Modi for trying to help find a peaceful solution to the Ukraine crisis.</p>

<p>"I am grateful to you for the attention you pay to the most pressing issues, particularly trying to find ways to resolve the Ukraine crisis, primarily through peaceful means," Putin was quoted as saying by the official TASS news agency.</p>

<p>PM Modi was on Tuesday officially conferred the 'Order of St Andrew the Apostle' award by President Putin for his contribution to fostering bilateral ties between the two countries. The award was announced in 2019.</p>

<p>When PM Modi lands in Vienna, it will be the first visit by an Indian prime minister to Austria in over 40 years, the last being of Indira Gandhi in 1983.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Meta Platforms said on Tuesday it would start taking down more posts that target "Zionists", where the term is used to refer to Jewish people and Israelis rather than representing supporters of the political movement.</p>

<p>The Facebook and Instagram parent said in a blog post it would remove content "attacking 'Zionists' when it is not explicitly about the political movement" and uses antisemitic stereotypes or threatens harm through intimidation or violence directed against Jews or Israelis.</p>

<p>Meta's hate speech policy prohibits direct attacks on people on the basis of what it calls protected characteristics, which include race, ethnicity, religious affiliation, disability and gender identity, among others.</p>

<p>The social media giant said its existing policies, which treat the term "Zionist" as a proxy for Jewish or Israeli people in just two narrow circumstances, did not sufficiently address the ways people use the word more broadly.</p>

<p>The policy update, which follows Meta's consultations with 145 stakeholders representing civil society and academia across global regions, comes as tensions escalate in the Middle East amid the Israel-Hamas war.</p>

<p>Meta has been criticized for years on how it handles content involving the Middle East, and those criticisms shot up further after the start of the war, with rights groups accusing the company of suppressing content supportive of Palestinians on Facebook and Instagram.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Four Indian-Americans, including a woman, have been charged with allegedly running a human labour trafficking scheme out of a home in the US state of Texas, a media report said.</p>

<p>The Princeton Police Department released details of an investigation that led to four people being arrested after 15 women were found inside the home as alleged victims of human labour trafficking, news portal Fox4News.com said on Monday night.</p>

<p>Chandan Dasireddy, 24, Dwaraka Gunda, 31, Santhosh Katkoori, 31, and Anil Male, 37, all arrested in March, are now charged with trafficking of persons, a second-degree felony, and more arrests are expected, the channel reported, quoting police.</p>

<p>The authorities found that all the young women, living in the same home, were forced to sleep on the floor at a home on Ginsburg Lane in Collin County, Princeton. "There was basically no furniture inside the home at the centre of human trafficking, just a bunch of computer electronics and blankets," police said.</p>

<p>Another news portal, McKinney Courier-Gazette said officers with the Princeton Police Department were dispatched on March 13 to a residence regarding a welfare concern and suspicious circumstance.</p>

<p>"After further investigation of the initial report, Princeton Police CID detectives obtained a search warrant for the home of Santhosh Katkoori, where 15 adult females were located. During the investigation, it was discovered that the females were forced to work for Katkoori and multiple programming shell companies owned by him and his wife, Dwaraka Gunda," it said.</p>

<p>While the search warrant was executed, multiple laptops, cell phones, printers and fraudulent documents were seized. It was later determined that multiple locations within Princeton, Melissa, and McKinney were involved in the forced labouring of the victims, including adult males, the portal said, adding, additional laptops, cell phones, and documents were seized from the other locations.</p>

<p>The original concern was raised by a pest control company, which was called for possible bed bugs. "Once inside, the inspector noticed that each room had 3-5 young females sleeping on the floors. There were also large amounts of suitcases. The company contacted police," Fox4News.com added.</p>

<p>The news portal quoted Princeton Police Sgt Carolyn Crawford who said over 100 more people are involved, "more than half of them victims." However, she did not reveal what type of labour operation was happening.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A day after a Russian missile strike on a children's hospital in Kyiv, rescuers continued to clear rubble from the scene as a day of mourning was held in the Ukrainian capital.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A day after a Russian missile strike on a children's hospital in Kyiv, rescuers continued to clear rubble from the scene as a day of mourning was held in the Ukrainian capital.</p>

<p>But like similar strikes in the past, the Ukrainian government and the Kremlin were at odds over what exactly happened.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Here's a quick rundown of what we know about the strike and the aftermath.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>What was hit</strong></h3>

<p>The strike on the hospital was part of a barrage that targeted cities across Ukraine on Monday morning, according to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The president said 38 people across Ukraine were killed -- including four children -- and 190 wounded.&nbsp;</p>

<p>During the attack, Ukrainian officials said a cruise missile slammed into the Okhmatdyt children's hospital in Kyiv.</p>

<p>The strike caused the collapse of the facility's toxicology wing and damaged large portions of the surrounding buildings that house several different medical departments, according to AFP journalists at the scene.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"At the time of the attack, 627 children were in the hospital. Of these, eight were injured. Unfortunately, two adults were killed," said military authorities in Kyiv.</p>

<p>The hospital complex holds around 700 beds and oversees an estimated 10,000 surgeries a year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Before the strike, medical staff halted operations at the facility after an air raid siren was activated and sent patients, family members, and others to the building's basement to seek shelter.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, not all were able to evacuate.</p>

<p>According to a doctor at the scene, some children remained in the hospital's surgical theatres where operations had already commenced and moving them would have been difficult.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Seven other districts in Kyiv were also damaged by direct hits or debris from falling missiles, said the city's military administration.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ten residents at an apartment block were killed during the onslaught in central Kyiv's Shevchenkivsky district, the mayor said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Five medical staff and two patients also died at the Adonis fertility centre, the clinic said.</p>

<h3><strong>The weapon</strong></h3>

<p>The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) said its initial assessment found that Moscow had struck the facility with a Kh-101 strategic cruise missile.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A Western expert working in the defence sector told AFP on the condition of anonymity that an image of the attack "clearly shows a Kh-101 airborne cruise missile in its dive phase".</p>

<p>"The missile shows no signs of damage, and its dive angle is itself consistent with that observed in other strikes," the expert added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Yohann Michel, expert at Institute for Strategic and Defence Studies (IESD), drew similar conclusions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"You'd have to check that the images haven't been altered, but on one of them you can clearly see a Kh-101 in perfect condition," he told AFP.</p>

<p>The strike was part of a wider barrage aimed at overwhelming Ukraine's air defences and focused on "different targets and used missiles with different trajectories and altitudes", Michel added.</p>

<h3><strong>Russian response</strong></h3>

<p>Following the strike, Russia's defence ministry said its forces had struck their "intended" defence industry and military targets.</p>

<p>The minister went on to blame the extensive damage inflicted on civilian targets on Ukrainian air defence missiles.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that Russia had not targeted civilian structures.</p>

<p>The United Nation disagreed, saying there was a "high likelihood" that the children's hospital suffered a direct hit from the Russian missile.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tourists thronging the Black Sea beaches of the Russian-annexed Crimean peninsula this summer share the space with a grim new arrival: bomb shelters and sandbags.</p>

<p>For more than two years, the beaches of the peninsula, which Moscow annexed in 2014, have been only one step removed from the raging battles of the war in Ukraine.</p>

<p>Last month, fragments from Ukrainian missiles killed four people, including two children, on a beach in the city of Sevastopol, injuring 151 more. Footage on Russian state television showed some victims being carried off on sun loungers.</p>

<p>Thousands of Ukrainian civilians have been killed since the start of the more than two-year-old war, and a much smaller number of civilians inside Russia or in parts of Ukraine, such as Crimea, that Russia claims to have annexed.</p>

<p>At the beach in Uchuyevka, on the outskirts of Sevastopol, bathers now share a pebbled shoreline with a concrete bomb shelter, reinforced with sandbags - a reminder of the unwelcome ways in which the war that Moscow calls a "special military operation" has encroached on the lives of ordinary people.</p>

<p>Irina, a tourist from the close Russian ally of Belarus, said: "In my opinion (the bomb shelters) are necessary."</p>

<p>"We are visiting friends here and we were told that it is very scary here, but here there are shelters and all safety measures are observed, I think it is very important."</p>

<p>Sevastopol's Russian-installed governor Mikhail Razvozhaev said last Friday that additional defence measures were necessary and accused Ukrainian authorities of being unhinged.</p>

<p>Ukraine has carried out multiple air and naval strikes on Russian military targets in Crimea. But legions of Russian tourists continue to visit each year for their annual holiday.</p>

<p>A Russian tourist, Alexander Zhukovskiy, said: "Probably, it will be calmer to be on the beach, to rest when you are sure that at any moment you can get under protection. So yes, they are needed."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Before the meeting, PM Modi spoke about his informal meeting with Putin on Monday. He spoke about the issues that were discussed during the meeting.</p>

<p>He noted that the talks between the two nations have been going on for 25 years. However, the attention of the entire world is focused on his visit to Russia.</p>

<p>PM Modi said, "The bilateral talks between the two nations have been going on for 25 years. We have met 22 times. This is such a meeting that the focus of the entire world is on this visit of mine. The entire world is drawing out different meanings of this visit."</p>

<p>Speaking about his meeting with Putin at the President's House, PM Modi stated, "You invited me to your residence and as a true friend, we stayed together for 4-5 hours and talked about many issues. I was happy that we were able to discuss our thoughts about Ukraine with an open mind and with great respect. We tried to respectfully understand each other's thoughts."</p>

<p>Noting that terrorism is "horrible and disgusting", PM Modi highlighted India has been facing the menace for over 40 years and said that he can imagine "how deep the pain is" when terror incidents occurred in Dagestan. PM Modi strongly condemned all kinds of terrorism during his bilateral meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.</p>

<p>"In the last 40-50 years, India has been facing terrorism. How horrible and disgusting terrorism is, we have been facing for the last 40 years. So, when terror incidents occurred in Moscow, when terror incidents occurred in Dagestan, I can imagine how deep its pain would be. I strongly condemn all kinds of terrorism," PM Modi said during his bilateral meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.</p>

<p>Stressing that there is no solution in the battlefield, PM Modi said, "As a friend, I have always said that for the future of our new generation, peace is the most important thing. But I also know that there is no solution in the battlefield. Peace talks do not succeed between bombs, guns and bullets. And we have to use the means of talks to adopt the path of peace."</p>

<p>PM Modi said that everyone who believes in humanity is pained when there is a loss of lives. He further stated that it is "heart-wrenching" when innocent children are dying.</p>

<p>PM Modi said, "Be it war, conflicts, terror attacks - everyone who believes in humanity is pained when there is loss of lives. But when innocent children are murdered, when we see innocent children dying, it is heart-wrenching. That pain is immense. I also held a detailed discussion with you over this."</p>

<p>Earlier in the day, Prime Minister Narendra Modi along with Russian President Vladimir Putin visited the Rosatom Pavilion at the VDNKh Exhibition Centre in Moscow. Russia's First Deputy Prime Minister, Denis Manturov, accompanied the two leaders, during the visit at Rosatom Pavilion.</p>

<p>After his visit to the Pavilion, PM Modi on X stated, "Visited the Atom Pavilion with President Putin. Energy is an important pillar of cooperation between India and Russia and we are eager to further cement ties in this sector."</p>

<p>Putin welcomed PM Modi at the venue and the two leaders warmly greeted each other. The two leaders then took a tour of the Rosatom Pavilion at VDNKH. PM Modi was seen interacting with the officials.</p>

<p>In a post on X, Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal stated, "PM @narendramodi accompanied by President Vladimir Putin of Russia visited the Atom Pavilion at the VDNKh Exhibition centre in Moscow. The Pavilion showcases the developments in the field of science and technology. Cooperation in peaceful uses of nuclear technology is an important pillar of the multifaceted cooperation between India and Russia."</p>

<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is currently on a two-day visit to Russia, also laid a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Moscow.</p>

<p>In a post on X, Randhir Jaiswal stated, "A solemn homage to the brave! PM @narendramodi laid a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Moscow, saluting valour, sacrifice and indomitable human courage."</p>

<p>PM Modi also addressed the Indian community in Moscow. He spoke about the ties between India and Russia and the contribution of the Indian community in strengthening them. He also announced the opening of Indian Consulates in Kazan and Yekaterinburg.</p>

<p>PM Modi arrived in Moscow for an official visit on Monday where he was received by Denis Manturov, the first Deputy Prime Minister of Russia and was accorded a ceremonial welcome. Indian community gave PM Modi a warm welcome at the hotel.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Greece's main opposition party Syriza said Tuesday that the recent introduction of a six-day working week for certain companies was a "disgrace".&nbsp;</p>

<p>The measure was brought into force by the right-wing ruling New Democracy party in early July. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Greece has been facing a shortage of skilled workers since the financial crisis of the late 2000s, which drove young people abroad in search of better prospects.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But the policy has attracted domestic and international attention as it goes against the grain of many Western countries, where the four-day week is being debated to boost productivity.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Such things are unacceptable. The government must understand that this policy has consequences," said Syriza spokesperson Voula Kehagia on private television channel Skai.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Kehagia added that it "shamed the country" by "ridiculing it abroad".&nbsp;</p>

<p>The six-day working week only applies to certain companies, including those that operate seven days a week, 24 hours a day.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Workers will be paid at least 40 percent more for the sixth day of work.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Government spokesman Pavlos Marinakis emphasised on Facebook that it is intended to address "emergency needs" with "qualified personnel".&nbsp;</p>

<p>Athens said the move combats undeclared work and addresses work shortages exacerbated by a declining population.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While the Greek average working week was the longest in the European Union at 39.8 hours last year, their productivity was lower than the average, according to Eurostat.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a tragic incident, an aviation mechanic&nbsp;died after getting sucked into a Boeing passenger jet's engine. The incident happened on July 3 at&nbsp;Chabahar Konarak airport in southern Iran when&nbsp;local technician Abolfazl Amiri was pulled into the engine of a Boeing passenger jet while performing routine maintenance work.</p>

<p>According to<a href="https://www.bild.de/news/ausland/nach-der-landung-mechaniker-von-triebwerk-angesaugt-tot-668cce13bdb18e1605d7d2cb" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">&nbsp;<em>Bild</em>,</a>&nbsp;the Boeing arrived in Tehran early at 7:15 am and landed safely in Chabahar Konarak airport. As per standard practice, the engine on the right-hand side was turned on for a test check with the cover flaps open. A safety area had also been set up around the engine as required.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, when Mr Amiri realised he had forgotten a tool on the engine, he went back towards the plane to retrieve it.&nbsp;As he went close to the turbine, he was sucked in and killed before the engine caught fire.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Although the airport fire brigade arrived quickly and extinguished the fire with water, rescuers were only able to recover the remains of the mechanic. The plane operated by domestic carrier Varesh Airlines was grounded for repairs, and an investigation into the accident was ordered by Iran's aviation authority.</p>

<p>In May, a similar incident happened when a man lost his life after being pulled into the engine of a KLM passenger plane at<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0dd9pxnd0lo"> Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport</a>.&nbsp;Passengers and crew members reportedly witnessed the tragic death before emergency services rushed to the scene. Speaking to the Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf, witnesses said there was a "hellish noise" as the person was sucked into the jet turbine.&nbsp;It is understood the man died after deliberately climbing into the engine.</p>

<p>Last year, a 27-year-old airport employee died after being sucked into a Delta passenger plane engine in San Antonio, Texas.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Investments in artificial intelligence (AI) startups surged to $24 billion from April to June, more than doubling from the previous quarter, according to data from Crunchbase, highlighting the growing appetite for the new technology.<br />
Overall startup funding grew 16% sequentially to touch $79 billion in the last quarter, primarily driven by investments in AI, which became the largest sector for the first time, followed by healthcare and biotech.</p>

<h2>Why Is It Important?</h2>

<p>The runway success of OpenAI's ChatGPT has unleashed a race to adopt the latest AI technology in areas such as business productivity, healthcare, and manufacturing. Investors and Big Tech firms, however, say that meaningful gains from their massive investments in AI will only materialize over the next few years.</p>

<h2>In Numbers</h2>

<p>Five out of six billion-dollar funding rounds went to AI companies.</p>

<p>Top deals included Elon Musk's xAI raising $6 billion and AI infrastructure provider CoreWeave's raising $1.1 billion in its latest funding round. Also on the list, automated driving company Wayve and data preparation company Scale AI.</p>

<p>Outside of AI, cybersecurity company Wiz raised a billion-dollar in its latest funding round.</p>

<h2>Broader Landscape</h2>

<p>Despite last quarter's uptick, startup funding remains low compared to the levels seen in the past three years.</p>

<p>Global funding declined 5% to $147 billion in the first half of the year and was flat compared to the second half of 2023, according to Crunchbase.</p>

<p>A tight monetary policy in the U.S. has contributed to a slow revival in initial public offerings, hampering what is among the biggest sources of returns for institutional private market investors, who typically invest in startups and sell shares during IPOs.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Slovakia's Prime Minister Robert Fico said he had returned to work on Tuesday, almost two months after a lone gunman had shot him four times on May 15.</p>

<p>The 59-year-old Fico was shot from close range after a government meeting in central Slovakia and underwent two lengthy surgeries in a nearby hospital.</p>

<p>The gunman, identified by Slovak media as 71-year-old poet Juraj Cintula and prosecuted on terrorism charges, is in custody awaiting trial.</p>

<p>Fico leads a three-party coalition of his centrist Smer-SD party, the centrist Hlas and the far-right SNS governing the EU and NATO member of 5.4 million people.</p>

<p>Slovak media said the nationalist-leaning Fico, who is often criticised by the EU along with Hungarian counterpart Viktor Orban, came to Tuesday's cabinet meeting through a tunnel to avoid journalists.</p>

<p>"Dear progressive liberal media and opposition, I apologise for having survived but I'm back," Fico said on Facebook, posting a picture of himself in his office.</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" height="250" scrolling="no" src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Frobertficosk%2Fposts%2Fpfbid0XrgowSd3BpZ58djzYzQotCGNEERJ7fNx91sMAV7Smph8gFAm3TdzXiFfFThgztVcl&amp;show_text=true&amp;width=500" style="border:none;overflow:hidden" width="500"></iframe></p>

<p>When Fico took office last autumn, Slovakia refused to continue military aid to Ukraine, facing a Russian invasion since February 2022.</p>

<p>The premier himself has been advocating peace talks with Russia, like Hungary's Orban.</p>

<p>Fico's cabinet has also raised eyebrows by approving bills seen as jeopardising judicial and media freedoms.</p>

<p>Fico was released from hospital on May 31 and made his first public appearance at a ceremony near Bratislava last Friday.</p>

<p>In a speech, he hailed Orban's controversial trip to Moscow, saying he "would have loved to join him" if he were healthy enough.</p>

<p>Fico also called on Slovakia to build a wall to stop "progressive and liberal ideologies", likening them to cancer.</p>

<p>Following the assassination attempt, Fico walks with a crutch. He has also visibly lost weight.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The research shows Artificial Intelligence (AI) can help fight breast cancer. Early and accurate diagnosis can be pivotal for treatment amongst patients, and a newly developed AI system promises to do so with near perfect diagnosis.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Breast Cancer accounts for 13.6 percent of all cancer cases (male and female) in India, according to the 2022 World Cancer Report published by IARC (International Agency for Research on Cancer). Amongst women, it goes up to 26 percent of all cancer cases. In the United States, breast cancer accounts for about 30% of all new cancer cases amongst women.</p>

<p>New Research shows Artificial Intelligence (AI) can help fight this menacing disease. Early and accurate diagnosis can be pivotal for treatment amongst patients, and a newly developed AI system promises to do so with near perfect diagnosis.</p>

<p>A research paper titled " Ensemble Deep Learning-Based Image Classification for Breast Cancer Subtype and Invasiveness Diagnosis from Whole Slide Image Histopathology" published in the Cancers Journal last month, details out an AI Model that classifies and identifies different types of breast cancer present in a patient, in addition to ruling out malignancy (cancer) in the first place by identifying benign tumors.</p>

<p>The study - done by researchers of Northeastern University, Boston along with Maine Health Institute for Research - has developed an AI model that analyses high resolution histopathological (tissue-level microscopic) whole slide images of breast tumor tissue.</p>

<p>The AI system, which outperforms earlier machine learning (ML) models in the domain by combining the predictions of other ML models, is capable of identifying and classifying the tumor into malignant (cancerous) or benign (non-cancerous) using historical data fed to the model during training.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-07/aiek6dd8_ai-ml-ensemble_625x300_09_July_24.jpg?im=FaceCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=1200,height=738" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>It was trained on publicly available datasets called BreakHis (Breast Cancer Histopathological Database) and BACH (Breast Cancer Histopathology images). For BACH, microscopic breast tissue images were meticulously labelled by medical experts, categorising the images into four classes - Normal, Benign, In Situ Carcinoma and Invasive Carcinoma.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Exemplary microscopy images demonstrating the four classes in the BACH dataset (Image Source: Cancers 2024, 16(12), 2222)  " id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-07/04jfmlh_tumor_625x300_09_July_24.jpg?im=FaceCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=1200,height=738" title="Exemplary microscopy images demonstrating the four classes in the BACH dataset (Image Source: Cancers 2024, 16(12), 2222)  " /></div>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"></div>
</div>

<p>And for BreakHis, which consists of 9,109 microscopic images of breast tumor tissue, it was used to categorise benign and malignant tumors further into 4 subclasses each- malignant tumors into Ductal carcinoma, Lobular carcinoma, Mucinous carcinoma and Papillary carcinoma, and benign tumors into Adenosi, Fibroadenoma, Phyllodes tumor, and Tubular adenoma.</p>

</div>

<p>Put together, the ensemble ML model has an accuracy of 99.84 percent. Such a performance metric during the research and development stage shows optimistic promise for the real-world application of the technology.</p>

<p>"The AI can't miss a tumor in the biopsy and won't be exhausted after diagnosing 10 or 20 people," said Saeed Amal to Northeastern Global News. Amal is a professor of bioengineering at Northeastern university and is leading the ensemble model project.</p>

<p>Apart from diagnosis, AI systems have also made progress in prognosis and predictions related to breast cancers. For example, AI can now predict the neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) response of breast cancer using Hematoxylin and eosin (common stains in tissue imaging) images of pre-chemotherapy needle biopsies. The AI systems responsible for the same have an accuracy of 95.15 percent and have been detailed out in a paper titled "Development of multiple AI pipelines that predict neoadjuvant chemotherapy response of breast cancer using H&amp;E-stained tissues," published in May 2023 in the Journal of Pathology.</p>

<p>Apart from this, AI has also made significant progress in identifying lymph node metastasis (spreading of cancer cells through lymphatic nodes) and evaluation of hormonal status which is important for breast cancer treatment. These and many more advances made by AI interventions over the years in the fight against breast cancer have been stated in a review paper published in Diagnostic Pathology in February.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[UN rights experts on Tuesday accused Israel of carrying out a "targeted starvation campaign" that has resulted in the deaths of children in Gaza.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>UN rights experts on Tuesday accused Israel of carrying out a "targeted starvation campaign" that has resulted in the deaths of children in Gaza.</p>

<p>"We declare that Israel's intentional and targeted starvation campaign against the Palestinian people is a form of genocidal violence and has resulted in famine across all of Gaza," 10 independent United Nations experts said in a statement.</p>

<p>The UN has not officially declared a famine in the Gaza Strip.</p>

<p>But the experts, including the UN special rapporteur on the right to food Michael Fakhri, insisted there was no denying famine was under way.</p>

<p>"Thirty-four Palestinians have died from malnutrition since 7 October, the majority being children," said the experts, who are appointed by the UN Human Rights Council, but who do not speak on behalf of the United Nations.</p>

<p>Their statement was immediately slammed by Israel's mission to the UN in Geneva, which charged that "Mr. Fakhri, and many so-called 'experts' who joined his statement, are as much accustomed to spreading misinformation, as they are to supporting Hamas propaganda and shielding the terrorist organisation from scrutiny".</p>

<p>The UN experts meanwhile listed three children who had recently died "from malnutrition", after a number of others were said to have starved to death in northern Gaza earlier this year.</p>

<p>"Fayez Ataya, who was barely six months old, died on 30 May 2024, and 13-year-old Abdulqader Al-Serhi died on June 1, 2024 at the Al-Aqsa Hospital in Deir Al-Balah," they said.</p>

<p>Nine-year-old Ahmad Abu Reida died just two days later "in the tent sheltering his displaced family in Al-Mawasi, Khan Younis", they said.</p>

<p>"With the death of these children from starvation despite medical treatment in central Gaza, there is no doubt that famine has spread from northern Gaza into central and southern Gaza," they said.</p>

<p>The experts decried that the world had not done more to avert this disaster.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"When a two-month-old baby and 10-year-old Yazan Al Kafarneh died of hunger on 24 February and 4 March respectively, this confirmed that famine had struck northern Gaza," they said.</p>

<p>"The whole world should have intervened earlier to stop Israel's genocidal starvation campaign and prevented these deaths."</p>

<p>"Inaction is complicity."</p>

<p>Gaza has been facing a deep humanitarian crisis since the war erupted following Hamas's October 7 attack on southern Israel that resulted in the deaths of 1,195 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.</p>

<p>In response, Israel has carried out a military offensive that has killed at least 38,243 people in Gaza, also mostly civilians, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-ruled territory.</p>

<p>The UN has been warning for months of a looming famine in Gaza, especially in the north, but one has not been officially declared.</p>

<p>The Israeli mission highlighted Tuesday that the latest assessment by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) partnership determined that famine had not materialised after aid access improved somewhat.</p>

<p>"Israel has continuously scaled up its coordination and assistance in the delivery of humanitarian aid across the Gaza Strip," it said, claiming Hamas "intentionally steal and hide aid from civilians".&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Three asylum seekers who brought court action to block the UK's attempt to send them to Rwanda had their cases resolved on Tuesday, after the incoming Labour government ditched the policy.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced on Saturday that the migrant deportation plan forged by the ousted Conservative government was "dead and buried".</p>

<p>There had already been a spate of legal challenges to the scheme, with the UK Supreme Court in November last year ruling that it was illegal under international law as Rwanda could not be considered a safe country for asylum seekers.</p>

<p>Government lawyer James Eadie told the High Court in London on Tuesday: "In relation to the three named claimants, these claimants' cases will be fully disposed of and withdrawn subject to the (interior ministry) paying their costs."</p>

<p>The Labour Party said before last Thursday's general election that it would ditch the scheme, which the Tories said would deter huge numbers of migrants trying to get across the Channel to the UK on small boats from northern France.</p>

<p>Sixty-five people were brought ashore Monday -- the first under the new government -- taking the total number of arrivals so far this year to 13,639, according to an AFP tally of official figures.</p>

<p>Rwanda, home to 13 million people in Africa's Great Lakes region, claims to be one of the most stable countries on the continent and has drawn praise for its modern infrastructure.</p>

<p>But rights groups accuse veteran President Paul Kagame of ruling in a climate of fear, stifling dissent and free speech.</p>

<p>A spokesman for his government said Monday that "Rwanda takes note of the intention of the UK government to terminate the Migration and Economic Development Partnership Agreement".</p>

<p>As part of the deal, the UK has already paid some £240 million ($307 million) to Rwanda, with a further £50 million scheduled to be sent at a later date.</p>

<p>In January, Kagame said the money was "only going to be used if those people will come. If they don't come, we can return the money".</p>

<p>However, he later specified there was "no obligation" to do so.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The election of relative moderate Masoud Pezeshkian as Iran's president has lifted the hopes of Iranians yearning for social freedoms and better relations with the West, but few expect big policy changes.</p>

<p>Iran's ruling clerics' political fortunes' rely on tackling economic hardship, so Pezeshkian may have a comparatively strong hand to revive the economy, but his scope to permit social freedoms will be limited, insiders and analysts said.</p>

<p>Under Iran's dual system of clerical and republican rule, the president cannot usher in any major policy shift on Iran's nuclear programme or foreign policy, since Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei calls all the shots on top state matters.</p>

<p>However, the president can influence the tone of policy and he will be closely involved in selecting the successor to Khamenei, now 85.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hardliners, entrenched in institutions Khamenei controls such as the judiciary, armed forces and the media, have in the past blocked either the new opening to the West or domestic liberalisation.</p>

<p>Khamenei has set out guidelines he would like to see in the new government by counselling Pezeshkian to continue the policies of hardline President Ebrahim Raisi, who was killed in a helicopter crash in May.</p>

<p>"Pezeshkian self-identifies as a 'principlist' - someone committed to the ideological principles of the revolution - and has been clear about his devotion to the Revolutionary Guards and Khamenei," said Karim Sadjadpour, an associate at the Carnegie Endowment in Washington.</p>

<h3><strong>Will Iran Change Its Stance On The Nuclear Standoff?</strong></h3>

<p>Pezeshkian, a 69-year-old former heart surgeon, won Iran's run-off presidential vote last week and is yet to be sworn in.</p>

<p>He has pledged to promote a pragmatic foreign policy and ease tensions with the six major powers that have been involved in now-stalled nuclear talks to revive a 2015 nuclear pact.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly, analysts said, Pezeshkian's victory was a setback for hawks such as his rival, hardliner Saeed Jalili, who opposed any opening to the West and revival of the nuclear pact.</p>

<p>Jalili's supporters have criticised a hardline watchdog body for allowing Pezeshkian to run, with insiders suggesting that this decision was made by Khamenei to secure a high turnout amid consistently low participation in elections since 2020.</p>

<p>Pezeshkian hopes that revived talks with the West would lead to a lifting of tough U.S. sanctions, given growing popular discontent over economic hardships.</p>

<p>However, White House spokesperson John Kirby said on Monday the United States was not ready to resume nuclear talks with Iran under the new president.</p>

<p>For Pezeshkian the stakes are high. The president could become politically vulnerable if he fails to revive the pact, which then-U.S. President Donald Trump ditched in 2018 and reimposed harsh sanctions on Iran.</p>

<p>"He has a difficult path ahead ... Pezeshkian's inability to revive the pact will weaken the president and also lead to a backlash against the pro-reform camp who backed him," said a senior reformist former official.</p>

<p>A restoration of ties with the United States, which Iran's rulers have called the "Great Satan" since taking power in a 1979 revolution, remains out of the question.</p>

<h3><strong>Will The Economy See A Boom?</strong></h3>

<p>As the economy remains the Achilles heel for Khamenei, breaking free of the crippling U.S. sanctions, which have cost Iran billions of dollars in income from oil, will remain the top economic goal for Pezeshkian.</p>

<p>Spiralling prices and constricted spending power have left millions of Iranians struggling against a combination of sanctions and mismanagement.</p>

<p>Khamenei knows the economic struggle is a persistent challenge for the ruling clerics, who fear a revival of protests that have erupted since 2017 among lower- and middle-income people angry at enduring hardship.</p>

<p>"Failure to improve the economy will lead to street protests, particularly now that people have high hopes because of Pezeshkian's campaign promises," said an insider who is close to Khamenei.</p>

<p>Iran's economic outlook looks ever more uncertain, analysts say, with the possible return of Trump as U.S. president considered likely to lead to tougher enforcement of oil sanctions.</p>

<h3><strong>Will Strict Social Restrictions Change?</strong></h3>

<p>Pezeshkian enjoys an insider status and close relationship with the theocratic Khamenei, and may be able to build bridges between factions to yield moderation, but this would not enable him to bring about the fundamental changes that many pro-reform Iranians demand.</p>

<p>Pezeshkian, analysts said, is highly likely to end up in a similar position to his predecessors - reformist President Mohammad Khatami and pragmatist Hassan Rouhani - who whetted Iranians' appetite for change but ultimately were blocked by hardliners in the dominant elite of clerics and the powerful Revolutionary Guards.</p>

<p>"Pezeshkian is neither a reformist nor a moderate ... As a foot soldier of Khamanei, Pezeshkian will be subjected to his wishes which clearly has been to rule by violence and repression," said Hadi Ghaemi, executive director of New York-based advocacy group the Centre for Human Rights in Iran (CHRI).</p>

<p>As a lawmaker in 2022, Pezeshkian criticised the establishment over the death in custody of young Iranian woman Mahsa Amini, which triggered months of unrest in Iran.</p>

<h3><strong>Will Iran Change Its Regional Policy?</strong></h3>

<p>Unlikely. The top authority in regional policy is not the president, but the Guards, who answer only to Khamenei.</p>

<p>Pezeshkian is taking office at a time of escalating Middle East tensions over the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon.</p>

<p>Signalling no change in Iran's regional policies, Pezeshkian reaffirmed on Monday Iran's anti-Israel stance and its support for resistance movements across the region</p>

<p>"Supporting the resistance of the people in the region against the illegitimate Zionist regime (Israel) is rooted in the fundamental policies of the Islamic Republic," Pezeshkian said in a message to the Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The Israeli man is thought to have potentially come into contact with the amoeba while swimming at Gai Beach on the shores of the Kinneret in northern Israel.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 25-year-old man has died after being infected with 'brain-eating amoeba', likely during a swim at a popular beach in Israel. According to <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/man-dies-after-contracting-brain-eating-amoeba-in-israels-2nd-ever-recorded-case/">Times Of Israel,</a></em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/man-dies-after-contracting-brain-eating-amoeba-in-israels-2nd-ever-recorded-case/">&nbsp;</a>the&nbsp;Israeli man, who officials have not publicly named, is thought to have potentially come into contact with the amoeba while swimming at Gai Beach on the shores of the Kinneret in northern Israel.</p>

<p>The man, without underlying health conditions, was initially admitted to Sharon Hospital last Tuesday after presenting with symptoms including fever, headaches, and vomiting. After his condition worsened, he was transferred to Beilinson Hospital in Petah Tikvah. Despite the best treatments, he died on Sunday.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The hospital said, ''Medical teams used everything at their disposal, including drug treatments and surgical interventions to save the patient's life, but his condition continued to deteriorate.''</p>

<p>Notably, this is the second-ever case recorded in Israel. A&nbsp; healthy 36-year-old man from northern Israel died of severe brain inflammation after contracting the amoeba in August 2022.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In India, the&nbsp;rare brain infection has claimed three lives. Last week, a&nbsp;14-year-old boy in Kerala died from the infection he contracted while swimming in contaminated water.&nbsp;The first instance was the death of a five-year-old girl from Malappuram on May 21 and the second was a 13-year-old girl from Kannur who died on June 25.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><b>What is Naegleria&nbsp;fowleri, the brain-eating amoeba?</b></h2>

<p>The&nbsp;<em>Naegleria fowleri</em>&nbsp;amoeba, commonly described as brain-eating amoeba because it destroys brain tissue, is typically found in bodies of warm freshwater such as lakes, rivers, or hot springs, and more rarely in poorly maintained under-chlorinated swimming pools.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Swimming or diving in water containing this amoeba can enter their bodies through the nose. Once in the nasal passages, Naegleria&nbsp;fowleri&nbsp;can travel to the brain, resulting in inflammation of the brain tissue and&nbsp;causing a severe infection called primary amebic meningoencephalitis (PAM), as per the&nbsp;<a href="http://%20https//my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/24485-brain-eating-amoeba">Cleveland Clinic</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Symptoms can include headaches, fever, nausea, and vomiting, and the illness "usually leads to coma and death after 5 days," according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&nbsp;Other symptoms can include a stiff neck, confusion, lack of attention to people and surroundings, loss of balance, and hallucinations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The mortality rate from encephalitis caused by the amoeba is extremely high, and while infection is extremely rare, it is often fatal. The US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) states that most people with PAM die within 1 to 18 days after symptoms start to appear.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Scientists have not found any effective treatments for PAM yet. Currently, doctors have been managing the disease with a combination of drugs.&nbsp;Only some 400 cases have ever been diagnosed worldwide.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Elections are taking place this year in countries home to almost half of the world's population, from Taiwan's general election in January to the U.S. presidential race in November.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Elections are taking place this year in countries home to almost half of the world's population, from Taiwan's general election in January to the U.S. presidential race in November.</p>

<p>The votes come amid growing economic and geopolitical strife, with the Ukraine war, conflicts in the Middle East and rising trade tensions between the United States and China, the world's two largest economies.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In some countries, there are concerns about the resilience of democracy itself as political discourse has polarized or been warped by disinformation. Many of this year's elections will not be free and fair - or their results will be disputed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Half-way through the biggest year for elections in history, here are some common themes that have emerged in Reuters' reporting from around the world:</p>

<h3><strong>Cost Of Living</strong></h3>

<p>From the price of green onions in Indonesia to higher fuel bills across Europe, rises in the price of food, energy and other basics have hit the living standards of households across the world. Incumbent governments and leaders are paying for it.</p>

<p>Polling showed that cost of living concerns were a powerful factor in a fall in support for Prime Minister Narendra Modi's party in India, losses suffered by mainstream parties in June's European Parliament elections and the poll rout of Britain's ruling Conservatives.</p>

<p>In Africa, discontent over living standards and unemployment contributed to the ANC's loss of its majority in South Africa's election. Worsening poverty is likely to help shape the outcome of Ghana's December vote to succeed President Nana Akufo-Addo.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Polling ahead of the U.S. election suggests voters are similarly unimpressed with President Joe Biden's efforts to improve their livelihoods, with many Americans feeling their living standards are falling despite strong headline economic data. One outlier: In Mexico, the ruling MORENA party emerged the winner after offering ample subsidies to low-income voters.</p>

<p>While economic policymakers say there are signs that inflation is returning to normal, they warn it has not yet been fully tamed and many economies remain fragile.</p>

<p>"A number of pressure points could throw the global economy off track," Agustin Carstens, head of the central bank umbrella group the Bank of International Settlements (BIS), warned in June.</p>

<h3><strong>Green Transition</strong></h3>

<p>With the cost of living uppermost in many voters' minds, climate change action has often been crowded out of election campaigns - even as global temperatures break new records and death tolls from extreme heat climb.</p>

<p>While surveys show Europeans still support ambitious action on global warming, the debate there has focused on the perceived cost to livelihoods, with farming and other lobbies stepping up calls for an easing of net-zero policies.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the EU elections, ecologist Greens shed most of the gains made five years earlier. In Britain, Labour dropped a 28-billion-pound green investment pledge ahead of the July 4 general election, saying the country could not afford it, while their Conservative rivals described themselves as "on the side of drivers", attacking low-traffic and low-emission schemes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The biggest challenge to the green transition may come from the United States, with Donald Trump campaigning on policies supporting continued fossil fuel use. It remains to be seen how much of Biden's Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) green subsidies stay in place in the event of a Trump victory.</p>

<h3><strong>Swing To The (Far) Right?</strong></h3>

<p>The cost of living crisis has led to rising support for far-right movement in Western countries with a mix of anti-immigration and nationalist policies, often unfunded economic spending plans and populist rhetoric attacking global elites.</p>

<p>Back in March, Portugal's Chega party quadrupled its seats in parliament to become the country's third-largest party. Three months later, its far-right, eurosceptic peers across Europe made gains in elections to the European Parliament.</p>

<p>In France, Marine Le Pen's National Rally failed in elections on Sunday to achieve the majority they were coveting but became the largest single party in a hung parliament that now risks plunging Europe's second-largest economy into policy paralyis.</p>

<p>In Britain, the anti-immigrant, nationalist Reform Party won over four million votes, contributing to the collapse in support for the ruling Conservatives even if Britain's first-past-the-post electoral system meant it only won a handful of seats.</p>

<p>Austria's Sept. 29 election will be closely watched, with polls showing the far-right Freedom Party (FPO) leading rivals after it ranked first in European Parliament elections.</p>

<p>In the United States, Trump has made immigration one of his top domestic campaign issues, declaring he would carry out mass deportations, end birthright citizenship, and expand a travel ban on people from certain countries.</p>

<p>Mohit Kumar, chief economist for investment house Jefferies, noted that immigration as an election theme was hottest in precisely the large Western economies whose ageing populations were creating labour shortages.</p>

<p>"Economically we need immigration but the political dynamics are shifting away from immigration," he said.</p>

<h3><strong>Debt And Election Largesse</strong></h3>

<p>With economic hardship so prevalent, many politicians are offering to spend big and cut taxes in a bid to win power - at the risk of adding to global debt already at record levels after huge post-pandemic stimulus packages in rich-world economies.</p>

<p>Credit rating firm S&amp;P Global has warned the United States, France and other Group of Seven (G7) governments were unlikely to halt rises in their debt "at the present stage in their electoral cycles".&nbsp;</p>

<p>The BIS annual report in June said an election year like this brought an "especially high" risk of fiscal expansion that could complicate efforts to bring inflation down to target.</p>

<p>Budget watchdogs in Britain and France - two countries struggling to balance their budgets - noted that many spending pledges were either unfunded or unrealistically costed.</p>

<p>Trump has pledged to keep in place a broad 2017 tax cut that he signed while in office, and his economic team has discussed a further round of cuts beyond those enacted in his first term.</p>

<p>Biden, meanwhile, proposes raising levies on businesses and rich individuals, while vowing not to increase taxes for households earning less than $400,000 a year and to assist low- and middle-income Americans with childcare costs. U.S. federal government currently has more than $34 trillion in debt.</p>

<p>Such levels of debt are seen making the global economy more vulnerable to financial shocks and the International Monetary Fund has urged governments to reduce their borrowing.</p>

<p>"Unfortunately, fiscal plans so far are insufficient and could be derailed further given the record number of elections this year," its chief economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas said in a recent blog.</p>

<h3><strong>Defence And Security</strong></h3>

<p>As geopolitical tensions rise, defence and security matters have been prominent in a number of election campaigns so far this year - particularly in countries near the hotspots.</p>

<p>In February, Finland elected as president Alexander Stubb, who campaigned on the previously non-aligned country fully participating in NATO and allowing the transit of nuclear arms through it. Incumbents in Lithuania won an election dominated by concerns over Russia and calls for higher defence spending.</p>

<p>Taiwan's presidential and parliamentary elections on Jan. 13 focused around arguments on how best to deal with China, which views the island as its own territory. The ruling DPP party secured the presidency for a third term as its candidate vowed to safeguard Taiwan from intimidation while emphasising the need for dialogue with Beijing.</p>

<p>In the United States, Democratic voters' anger over Israel's military action in Gaza - and over Biden's continued support of Israel - has emerged as a major vulnerability for him. American views on the conflict have broken down along party lines with Republicans largely supporting Israel.</p>

<p>While Biden voices unwavering support for NATO, Trump has said that if he is returned to the White House, America would fundamentally rethink NATO's purpose. He has also asserted without evidence that if elected he would end the conflict in Ukraine before even taking office. On that, Biden has retorted that Trump has "no idea what he's talking about".</p>

<h3><strong>Democracy At Stake?</strong></h3>

<p>Pro-democracy watchdogs estimate that nearly three-quarters of the world's population live in autocracies. Observers and human rights groups have signalled concerns about the fairness of elections this year in Bangladesh, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Cambodia, Iran and Russia. Votes in Algeria and Uzbekistan face similar questions.</p>

<p>Modi's electoral setback has been hailed by some commentators as proof of the resilience of its democracy. There was relief at the peaceful handover of power in Senegal in March after moves by the incumbent to delay the vote triggered protests.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Democracy's biggest test this year may, however, be in Washington.</p>

<p>Trump refuses to commit to accepting the election results or to rule out possible violence around the Nov. 5 contest. He is already laying the groundwork to contest a potential defeat.</p>

<p>"We should be quite worried," Steven Levitsky, political scientist and professor of government at Harvard University, told a Brookings think tank event in June.</p>

<p>"A democracy cannot survive if one party in a two-party system is not committed to playing by the democratic rules of the game."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In a post on X (formerly Twitter) Mr Zelenskyy referred to Russia's attack Monday - in which at least 37 people, including three children, were killed after a missile strike on a children's hospital in Kyiv.</p>

<p>His tweet included photographs of the bombed hospital and babies in ambulances.</p>

<p>Mr Zelenskky's post came after Prime Minister Modi met President Putin in Moscow and shared an embrace. Visuals from their meeting showed the two leaders drinking tea on a terrace at Mr Putin's home in Novo-Ogaryovo outside Moscow, and Mr Modi being driven around in a golf cart.</p>

<p>One photo in particular - of <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/topic/pm-modi-hugs-putin" target="_blank">Mr Modi and Mr Putin hugging</a> - has been widely shared online.</p>

<p>And the Ukraine President was particularly critical of that image, posting, "It is a huge disappointment and a devastating blow to peace efforts to see the leader of the world's largest democracy hug the world's most bloody criminal in Moscow on such a day..."</p>

<p>PM Modi flew into Moscow on a two-day visit that treads a fine line between maintaining a longstanding relationship and courting closer ties with the West amid the war in Ukraine.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is the Prime Minister's first visit since he was voted back to power last month.</p>

<p>It is also his first to Russia since the war in Ukraine began.</p>

<p>Sources have told NDTV that Mr Modi, during his meeting with Mr Putin, stressed no solution - to the violence - could be found on the battlefield. "India has always called for respecting the United Nations Charter, including territorial integrity and sovereignty. There is no solution on the battlefield. Dialogue and diplomacy is the way forward," Mr Modi is believed to have said.</p>

<p>Mr Modi has also spoken to Mr Zelenskyy on numerous occasions, including meeting him in Italy last month <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/pm-narendra-modi-ukraine-president-volodymyr-zelensky-meet-on-sidelines-of-g7-summit-in-italy-5889246" target="_blank">on the sidelines of the G7 summit</a>. The two were photographed sharing a hug.

<p>In a phone call with President Zelenskyy in October 2022, PM Modi said there can be "no military solution" and that India is ready to contribute to any peace efforts</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A New York City bridge&nbsp;that connects Manhattan to the Bronx&nbsp;became stuck open on Monday afternoon after hot summer weather caused it to overheat. Notably, the Third Avenue Bridge, built in 1898, crosses the Harlem River and serves as the link between the two boroughs. On Monday, temperatures hit 35°C, reportedly resulting in the metal machinery to overheat and swell.</p>

<p>&nbsp;According to <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/major-new-york-city-bridge-gets-unexpectedly-stuck-summer-temps-authorities-investigate">Fox News</a></em>,&nbsp;the metal on the 126-year-old bridge expanded due to extreme heat at about 3 p.m. and caused it to become stuck open.&nbsp;"[There was a] report of bridge stuck halfway open. Marine units standing by as well as land units,'' officials said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Crews on boats spent hours spraying water onto the bridge to cool the metal so they could realign it with the road deck. Aerial footage showed FDNY boats spraying water onto the span and bottom of the open bridge to cool it.&nbsp;</p>

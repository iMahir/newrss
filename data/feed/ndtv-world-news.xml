<p>"Why harp on the facts, it's the exaggerations that makes a tale interesting!" A favourite aunt once exclaimed when I tried to fact-check a funny family story she was narrating to a huge, giggling audience two decades ago. Each member of my clan cheered her on and it was the start of a delightful evening.</p>

<p>Donald Trump's interview with Elon Musk sent me back in time as I waded through the conversation. Both Trump and Musk know the importance of exaggerations in any narrative. The Indic epic poets knew it. Herodotus knew it. And so did Boccaccio, Chaucer, and Shakespeare. Trump's exaggerations, ably supported by his interviewer, made for a good story for his supporters. All 60 million of them he thought were tuned into the live broadcast. This number is an exaggeration, too.</p>

<h2><strong>A Risk Worth Taking</strong></h2>

<p>But why does Trump exaggerate all the time despite a bevvy of fact-checkers waiting to give each syllable uttered by him a hang-draw-quarter treatment? Political storytelling is assessed under different rubrics than literary texts. Is this a risk worth taking? The answer is a resounding yes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Trump capitalises on narcissism when he indulges in making outlandish claims. To understand this link better, let's look at what the experts have to say about narcissism. "For the narcissistically involved person, there is only one reality: that of his own thought processes, feelings and needs. The world outside is not experienced or perceived objectively, i.e., as existing in its own terms, conditions and needs," Erich Fromm proposed in the 1950s. &nbsp;Fromm also posited that narcissists have a stronger sense of entitlement. This lays bare the reasons behind Trump's constant resort to exaggerations.</p>

<h2><strong>Narcissism And Politics</strong></h2>

<p>All politicians are narcissistic in some measure; this trait allows them to, first, enter politics, and then stay in it. Narcissism, however, has a highly specialised function for certain political ideologies. The interlinkages of narcissism with the sense of entitlement are important to understand while analysing why Trump's narcissism works for him politically. A study conducted by political scientists Peter K. Hatemi and Zoltân Fazekas found that "In the 2016 election, higher entitlement reflected the mood of the general public, certainly among the working class, which voted Republican in greater numbers". Hatemi and Fazekas propose that narcissism may have a role to play in the rise of populist politics. Trump's constituents and those curious about him are offered a blanket of familiarity.</p>

<p>In simple terms, Trump's worldview, presented with an exaggerated sense of self-importance and confidence, wins people over. People who are ever so anxious about their entitlements being eroded. And this is why statements like the following work: "Our crime rate's going through the roof." Who cares whether the FBI's reports show a consistent decline in crime levels since 2020, his last presidential year? Add to it a provocative claim about Kamala Harris, "She wants to release all the prisoners that are in detention, and some of these guys are really bad. That just came out today" and you have successfully created a sense of impending doom.</p>

<h2><strong>Trump, The Rescuer</strong></h2>

<p>Trump is relying on honest Americans to believe that their entitlements are being eaten away by outsiders. Thus, he makes exaggerated claims like, "You have millions of people coming in a month" and "I believe it's over 20 million people came into our country" about illegal immigrants. He wants people to believe that they are living under extraordinary circumstances by saying, "I think we have the worst inflation we've had in 100 years. They say it's 48 years, I don't believe it". Shrinking entitlements being further nibbled on by outsiders-which one of us, narcissist or not, would find that desirable?</p>

<p>People need to despair for the narcissist to, then, brandishing his exaggerated belief in self, come in for the rescue. Trump wants people to believe that he, and only he, can solve these crises. Just the way only he could "solve" the Iran and China crises for the United States. "Iran was broke because I told China, 'If you buy from Iran...' Oil, it's all about the oil, that's where the money is. '...If you buy oil from Iran, you're not going to do any business with the United States.' And I meant it, and they said, 'We'll pass,' and they didn't buy oil." America can be made great again only when it is unequivocally established that it is in ruins. And it can be made great again only by Trump.</p>

<p>Trump's conversation with Musk, therefore, needs to be seen not as a "rambling" one which has significantly undermined his presidential prospects but as a tested strategy aimed at his constituents and swing voters. Whether it will fetch him a repeat of the 2016 outcome remains to be seen.&nbsp;<br />
Till then, let's get lost in the meandering world of storytelling.&nbsp;</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On August 5, 2024, the US Court for the District of Columbia (DC) decided that Google was a monopolist, meaning it has durable market power as the dominant player in its field of "general search services". This is a violation of competition law.</p>

<p>As a remedy, the DC Court may seek Google search neutrality, requiring it to make its search results transparent. But this decision seems unlikely to be the harbinger of a strongly regulated Federal Search Commission, or even a better search experience.</p>

<p>Fines will have no effect on Google, or its peers Apple or Amazon - each of whom is facing major cases of their own.</p>

<p>When a company is as rich as Croesus and can employ every competition law firm in the world to appeal decisions, that will not worry the boardrooms.</p>

<p>What will worry them is being forced to interoperate their systems with those of smaller, more innovative and cybersecure rivals.</p>

<p>When consumers can send a message from their iPhone to any platform, not just iMessage, just as you can with email or text messages, that will scare Apple into compliance.</p>

<p>The US Department of Justice is seeking interoperability as the remedy in the case against Google, and hopefully also for Apple and Amazon. It's not a magic bullet, but it is the most pro-competitive position short of breaking up these vertically integrated platforms.</p>

<p>In the 1990s, American legal scholar and activist Lawrence Lessig called to break up Microsoft, which is still the most profitable of all the tech giants. Instead, the regulators in the US and the European Union imposed some interoperability, though they botched the details so benefits to consumers were restricted, despite record fines imposed.</p>

<p>In 2024, there is less appetite to break up the behemoths, but some to impose interoperability, which regulators now understand much better than in the 1990s.</p>

<p>In the EU, the Digital Markets Act 2022 has imposed interoperability on those platforms since 2023, though it is imperfectly implemented as yet, with teething troubles in the EU unit responsible for enforcement.</p>

<h3><strong>How we got here</strong></h3>

<p>In 2008, law professors Oren Bracha and Frank Pasquale critiqued the fast emerging monopoly on internet search by the "do no evil" Stanford start-up turned billion-dollar company, Google.</p>

<p>That year, Barack Obama - the "Blackberry candidate" addicted to his smartphone - was elected the 44th President of the United States in what was known as the "Facebook Election" for his team's revolutionary online campaigning.</p>

<p>Obama's technology policy was dominated by a commitment to network neutrality, declared in a Googleplex Talk in Silicon Valley in late 2007, when he was mentored by his old University of Chicago Law School colleague - Lawrence Lessig.</p>

<p>Lessig had been Special Master in the Justice Department prosecution of the Microsoft software-into-Internet browser competition case. He praised Obama for finally ensuring net neutrality in 2014, against the wishes of the Republican-controlled Congress.</p>

<p>Google supported the Obama network neutrality policy and he failed to adopt the congruent Pasquale policy of search neutrality.</p>

<p>Why did the Democrats take so long to tackle Google? They tackled the Global Financial Crisis immediately after taking office and repaired the global economy at the cost of creating a moral hazard by telling Wall Street banks they were too big to fail (proved by letting Bear Stearns fail and watching global markets meltdown).</p>

<p>By 2015, these banks underwrote Donald Trump's revolutionary bid for the White House, a campaign which benefited from free coverage from cable news and some Facebook advertising fuelled by Cambridge Analytica, itself funded by billionaire hedge fund manager Robert Mercer and his daughter Rebecca.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Google, Facebook, Apple and the other big tech firms including Amazon, were moving from billion-dollar companies into trillion-dollar companies, raised by their voracious appetite for swallowing smaller rivals such as LinkedIn and Skype (Microsoft), AdSense and Motorola (Google), WhatsApp and Instagram (Facebook).</p>

<p>Obama's Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission (FTC) waved through all of these mergers, with economists claiming that the price of free service was vertically integrated advertising-funded platforms.</p>

<p>They also blocked moves towards a new federal privacy law, despite a valiant attempt by US academic Danny Weitzner to achieve a basic legislative standard.</p>

<p>This period of laissez-faire unregulated growth created the unregulated Silicon Valley monstrously dominant platform environment of the Trump presidency.</p>

<p>Economists even hailed such monocultures as a healthy wealthy outcome, despite the huge cybersecurity liability they created.</p>

<p>COVID lockdowns in 2020-21 forced white-collar workers home, to work on these social media and e-commerce platforms even more intensively.</p>

<p>Even universities became huge users and funders of those dominant platforms.</p>

<p>They are now multi-trillion-dollar behemoths, the most highly valued commercial enterprises in history, even more prized by investors than Shell or BHP in the 20th century or the British East India Company in the 19th century.</p>

<p>Finally, the dominance of Google, Apple, Amazon and Facebook forced even the Department of Justice to act.</p>

<p>Joe Biden's COVID-19-sheltered campaign against an increasingly deranged and insurrectionist Trump led to the appointment of Lina Khan as Chair of the FTC in June 2021.</p>

<p>Khan was academically renowned for her work on a student paper she wrote called Amazon's Antitrust Paradox, explaining the dangers of vertical dominance in digital markets, and she had quit the Google-funded Open Markets Institute thinktank when Google tried to stop her investigating and advocating for healthier competitive digital markets.</p>

<p>FTC got to work prosecuting the biggest monopolies the world has ever seen. Now we have results.</p>

<p>We have a court judgment which is a statement of the obvious - Google is dominant in digital markets. Its behaviour has been abusive. Soon we will have a further finding against Apple and then Amazon.</p>

<p>We will also have an election in which the CEO of LinkedIn, lifelong Democrat Reid Hoffman, has called on the Democrats to replace Lina Khan, and Trump is funded by the Silicon Valley oligarchs and crypto fraudsters who also would gut the FTC.</p>

<p>If the Department of Justice pressed for the judge in the Google case to impose a remedy that equalised the rules globally, that would be a real result for consumers and competition.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Actor Matthew Perry, one of the leads of the superhit sitcom "Friends", seemed to "freeze up" after a doctor administered a "large dose" of ketamine two weeks before his overdose, according to a report.&nbsp;The doctor was charged in connection with his death on Thursday, the <a href="http://https://nypost.com/2024/08/16/us-news/matthew-perry-seemed-to-freeze-up-after-large-ketamine-2-weeks-before-death/">NY post </a>reported.</p>

<p>Shocking details have emerged about the involvement of Perry's long-time assistant and medical professionals accused of taking advantage of the actor's battle with substance abuse. They allegedly sold him ketamine for thousands of dollars, which contributed to his death.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Among those facing charges are Salvador Plascencia and another doctor, Mark Chavez, Perry's long-time assistant Kenneth Iwamasa and alleged street dealer Erik Fleming and Jasveen Sangha, known as the “Ketamine Queen of Los Angeles".</p>

<p>US Attorney Martin Estrada said that the medical professionals provided Perry with a large quantity of ketamine, a drug typically used as an anaesthetic. It was revealed that the doctors discussed how much the former "Friends" star might be willing to pay in a series of text messages, using derogatory terms to refer to him.</p>

<p>Plascencia, 42, was licenced to prescribe and administer the powerful sedative but took advantage of Perry's well-known drug problems. Plascencia even texted Iwamasa, “I wonder how much this moron will pay” for ketamine as the actor's condition worsened, according to the indictment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, 16 days before Perry was found dead in a hot tub at his California home in October 2023, the doctor retreated when the actor had an episode in which he seemed to “freeze up” and his blood pressure went up after receiving a “large dose” of ketamine.</p>

<p>Iwamasa, who had lived with Perry and served as his assistant since 1994, administered at least 27 doses of ketamine to the actor during the final five days of his life. Three of the doses, prosecutors claim, led to his “death and serious bodily injury".<br />
<br />
At the time of his death, Perry had been undergoing weeks of ketamine therapy for depression. When the clinic physicians refused to increase his ketamine dosage, the Fools Rush In star reached out to Plascencia, as stated by Anne Milgram, administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[With sales surging and Netflix viewership soaring, Hillbillly Elegy's portrayal of the American Dream could prove a potent tool - or a double-edged sword - in JD Vance's political arsenal.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With sales surging and Netflix viewership soaring, Hillbillly Elegy's portrayal of the American Dream could prove a potent tool - or a double-edged sword - in JD Vance's political arsenal.</p>

<p>The Ohio Senator's 2016 book returned to bestseller lists as soon as he was selected as Donald Trump's running mate for the 2024 US Presidential election.</p>

<p>It sold 200,000 copies in five days after the announcement. Just 1,500 books had been sold the previous week. Viewership of the Netflix film adaptation, directed by Ron Howard and starring Amy Adams and Glenn Close, has surged more than 1000 per cent since July 15.</p>

<p>The book and the film peddle a cultural narrative about the American Dream that is potent - if the audience buys into the story it's selling, and ignores a couple of inconvenient truths.</p>

<p>Hillbilly Elegy tells the story of Vance's upbringing in a poor, white, working-class family in Appalachia. His single mother struggled with addiction and continually re-partnered.</p>

<p>The young JD, as described by the 32-year-old narrator, lamented the repeated loss of father figures.</p>

<p>Critics quibble over whether Vance or Middletown, Ohio, where he grew up, can legitimately claim to be Appalachian (check out Reddit, if you like). Regardless, his story of a mixed-generation, migratory family that struggled with alcohol and drugs and disappearing jobs in Rust Belt America should have wide resonance in the lead-up to this year's presidential election - just as it had resonance in 2016 when Trump won.</p>

<p>Vance's account of the lack of individual responsibility in the face of difficult circumstances (his family, especially his mother) and individual discipline and determination leading to next-generation success (Vance) initially became a decoder ring for voters in important swing states such as Michigan, Pennsylvania, Arizona and Wisconsin.</p>

<p>And it may also resonate with these voters themselves - who include not only working-class Americans left behind by America's financialised, de-unionised, postindustrial economy - but also immigrant families who hold conservative views and are chasing the classic immigrant's tale of achieving the American Dream.</p>

<p>The latter group is often overlooked as part of Trump's Republican Party.</p>

<p>But there are caveats to how resonant this book is to American voters. Its message about the American Dream is potent only if you ignore two key facts.</p>

<h3><strong>Understanding Trump voters</strong></h3>

<p>First, the memoir functions as a political object. The book is not for hillbillies, or anyone else who might see themselves in Vance's construction of what scholar Dwight Billings has called "Trumpalachia."</p>

<p>Instead, the book was a kind of manual for a liberal, coastal, and upper-class understanding of Trump voters after the 2016 election.</p>

<p>Vance could not have been luckier with the timing of publication and the ensuing appetite for explanations of "what was wrong with America."</p>

<p>Happily for liberal readers, the book can be taken to suggest the problem is mostly something wrong with the voters, rather than America. Yes, the loss of well-paid, union manufacturing jobs doesn't help, but there is something intransigent about the hillbillies who held these jobs, it seems to say.</p>

<p>The first character that gets extended treatment, besides Vance, is a workmate at a tile store who takes half-hour toilet breaks and doesn't turn up to work despite a pregnant girlfriend. Yet he complains of being hard done by when he is fired.</p>

<p>This character becomes a stand-in figure for a crucial pivot away from Vance's previous worldview - that the issue is the historical and economic conditions in which these people find themselves, not the people.</p>

<p>The book paints Vance as an underdog who, through hard work and, finally, some home-life stability, managed to throw off the shackles of intergenerational trauma and tough economic times and "make good".</p>

<p>In this way, the book is like a manifesto for the American Dream. (If Vance can do it, so can everyone - no excuses.)</p>

<h3><strong>Vance and the elites</strong></h3>

<p>Second, the book is an exercise in personal and professional credentialing for Vance.</p>

<p>He is a native informant for the network of elites of which he wants to be a part.</p>

<p>He follows different trends, such as the tech bro anti-humanism of someone like former PayPal CEO Peter Thiel, but he also converts to Catholicism in 2019. (Appalachians and "hillbillies" are usually some variant of Protestantism.)</p>

<p>Vance explains to readers that he didn't realise wealth and power derives from networks of the already wealthy and powerful. They already know this, of course - he's letting them know why he didn't know.</p>

<p>He simply wanted to be a lawyer because they were the richest people around him growing up. To signify this network, "Yale" is uttered as a talisman by hillbillies and Yalies alike throughout Ron Howard's film adaptation.</p>

<p>Vance getting into Yale Law School is not so much about a job - what he will or wants to do as a lawyer is not clear, and the book indicates he didn't really care about what kind of law he would eventually practice - but what it symbolises: making a strong, positive impression on those that can advance your career, despite the complications of a heroin-overdosing mother back home, and your attendant righteous rage.</p>

<p>There's no suggestion that the existence of this elite network might be a problem.</p>

<p>Vance's story is also that of a child seeking out parental figures. After his grandmother's death, he is guided through adulthood initially by Marine superiors, then by the infamous Tiger Mom, Amy Chua.</p>

<h3><strong>Trump the father figure</strong></h3>

<p>His latest father figure, of course, is Trump.</p>

<p>Of that pair, Jeffrey Fleishman offers a now-striking contrast in his 2016 review of the book: "Trump, whose father gave him a fortune, and Vance, whose father gave him up for adoption, are speaking of the same audiences but with opposing messages."</p>

<p>While Trump likes to suggest that the American Dream is dead because of liberal governments whose environmental policies ripped coalfield jobs from American workers (and shipped other work overseas), Vance "pushes the blame back onto individuals," as Fleishman explains.</p>

<p>This brings us to a much-discussed question: Vance once pondered whether Trump might be an American Hitler, and is now his running mate - so what's changed?</p>

<p>It seems at the time of his book's publication, Vance was already moving on from the hard work ethos and respectability politics of his memoir.</p>

<p>Wading out of the mainstream, he, for example, accepted the financial backing of a section of Big Tech that thinks democracy has played out.</p>

<p>This move dulls some of the political usefulness of his elegy, in which the pastoral lament jars against a dystopian, posthuman agenda: Peter Thiel is thanked in the book's closing acknowledgments.</p>

<p>Democrats can trace this path by highlighting the shifting, out-there positions Vance has advanced in previous years.</p>

<p>His suggestion that parents should get more say in the democratic process by being able to vote on behalf of their children, for example, or his apparent suggestion that even violent marriages shouldn't end in divorce.</p>

<p>The function of Hillbilly Elegy has changed with Vance entering the presidential race.</p>

<p>It is no longer a manual for coastals, liberals, and elites to understand the Trump voter, but something that hews more closely to its credentialing purpose: It's a political object.</p>

<p>It becomes ballast for Vance's claims to be, to speak to and for, and to serve, an idealised if imperfect Everyman who loves his country and his family yet is not getting his fair share.</p>

<p>But it is also an argument and story that can be dissected and contrasted with his later political statements and every public utterance and performance he makes between now and November 5.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former US President Donald Trump's latest financial disclosure documents show he owns more than $1 million (Rs 8,39,68500) in cryptocurrency and made $300,000 (Rs 2,51,90550) from endorsing branded Bibles.</p>

<p>As per the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/08/15/politics/read-donald-trump-financial-disclosure-forms/index.html">documents released</a> on Thursday, Trump earned $300,000 in royalty payments for "The Greenwood Bible." <em>"The Greenwood Bible"</em> is officially titled <em>"God Bless the USA Bible."</em> Its name comes from the GOP-favourite Lee Greenwood song.</p>

<p>According to the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://godblesstheusabible.com/">branded Bible's website</a>, it sells for $59.99 and includes a handwritten chorus to the song "God Bless the USA." by country singer Lee Greenwood. A limited-edition copy that is said to bear Trump's signature is also available on the website for $1,000.</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/08/15/politics/financial-disclosure-trump-2024/index.html"><em>CNN,</em></a> the disclosure, which totalled more than 250 pages, offers a window into the president's extensive finances, including everything from his real estate business to his investments, income, and debts. The release from the Federal Election Commission marks the first public update of his finances in a year.</p>

<p>The documents are a reminder of Trump's business interests all across the globe, including dozens of registered trademarks in China as well as ones in Saudi Arabia, Iran, Ukraine, and Israel, among many others. It also reveals tidbits about how the president keeps his fortune, from millions of dollars' worth of cryptocurrency to a six-figure investment in gold bars.</p>

<p>Recently, Elon Musk hosted a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://x.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1823430600872878321">2-hour unscripted interview</a> with Donald Trump, attracting over 1.3 million live views on X.</p>

<p>They discussed immigration, the US economy, and Biden's administration. Reactions were mixed, and the interview's impact on Trump's campaign remains uncertain, with Kamala Harris currently leading in the polls.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Donald Trump has said that Kamla Harris will be a terrible president, launching a fresh attack on the vice president.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I think I'm entitled to personal attacks. I don't have a lot of respect for her. I don't have a lot of respect for her intelligence, and I think she'll be a terrible president," he said further, attacking Harris in a fresh set of remarks.</p>

<p>"And I think it's very important that we win," he continued saying. "And whether the personal attacks are good, bad. She certainly attacks me personally. She actually called me weird."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tech giant Google has announced to bring its 'AI Overviews' feature to six new countries, including India.</p>

<p>In India, the company is rolling out the 'AI Overviews' in English and Hindi and are also introducing popular country-first features that were well-received during its Search Labs experiment.</p>

<p>"It will help you easily switch between English and Hindi results with the language toggle button, and listen to responses with Text-To-Speech by tapping the 'Listen' button," the company said in a blog post.</p>

<p>The six new countries are India, United Kingdom, Japan, Indonesia, Mexico and Brazil, along with local language support in each country.</p>

<p>Hema Budaraju, Senior Director, Product Management, Search, said as part of the testing, "we've seen that Indian users listen to AI Overviews responses more often than other countries".</p>

<p>"We're introducing more ways to check out relevant websites while you search, with a new right-hand link display for AI Overviews on desktop - also accessible on mobile by tapping the site icons on the upper right," Budaraju mentioned.</p>

<p>People who are looking for help with complex topics are engaging more and keep coming back for AI Overviews. Google found that people prefer using Search with AI Overviews, and they find their search results more helpful.</p>

<p>"As we evolve the Search experience with AI Overviews, we remain focused on helping people access information and perspectives from a diverse range of sources," said Budaraju.</p>

<p>And when people click from search result pages with AI Overviews, these clicks are higher quality for websites - meaning users are more likely to spend more time on the sites they visit.</p>

<p>"Our continued focus on improving and growing Search also allows us to send more qualified traffic to the web," said Google.</p>

<p>The company is also testing the addition of links to relevant web pages directly within the text of AI Overviews (in addition to the prominent links it already shows), making it even easier for people to click out and visit sites that interest them.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few short weeks ago, Joe Biden was set to headline the Democratic National Convention -- but after a brutal political comedown, he's now the warm-up act for Kamala Harris.</p>

<p>For a proud man like the 81-year-old US president, his speech on the first day of the party's gathering in Chicago on Monday is sure to come with conflicting emotions.</p>

<p>Still harboring frustration over his <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/joe-biden-quits-us-presidential-race-full-text-of-announcement-6156766" target="_blank">exit from the White House</a> race, Biden will be trying to balance his feelings with the need to help his vice president beat Republican Donald Trump in November.</p>

<p>With Harris set to formally accept the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday, Biden's appearance was going to be like "opening for Taylor Swift," said Brookings Institution senior fellow William Galston.</p>

<p>"This will not be an easy speech," Galston told AFP.</p>

<p>But like all US presidents, Biden has an eye on the history books, and he'll know that the surest way to secure his legacy now runs through Harris.</p>

<p>"I'm sure he understands that the chances that his presidency will be regarded as successful go way up if Kamala Harris succeeds him," said Galston.</p>

<h3><strong>The worst night&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Trump has wasted no time in <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/donald-trump-mock-bidens-old-age-ahead-of-his-own-78th-birthday-5887446" target="_blank">mocking</a> the fact that his former opponent no longer has top billing.</p>

<p>"Monday, that's the worst day," Trump told a rally on Wednesday. "They're not even giving him a good spot to speak."</p>

<p>The former president also accused Harris of "trying to throw him (Biden) overboard."</p>

<p>Biden has deliberately taken a back seat to Harris since his stunning July 21 decision to bow out of the race following a catastrophic debate against Trump.</p>

<p>As Harris reenergizes the Democratic Party, Biden has spent long spells at his Delaware holiday home, where he was spotted cycling and relaxing on the beach with his family this past weekend.</p>

<p>And at times he has made light about the sudden end of his five-decade political career.</p>

<p>"I invited you to the White House because I'm looking for a job," Biden joked with influencers at an event on Wednesday.</p>

<p>But there have been flashes of frustration too.</p>

<p>Biden is reportedly angry at former US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's role in pushing him out, and disappointed that former president Barack Obama didn't do more to support him.</p>

<p>Acknowledging that Congressional Democrats feared Biden would harm their own electoral chances in November, Biden told CBS on Sunday that "I was concerned if I stayed in the race, that would be the topic."</p>

<p>"You'd be interviewing me about 'why did Nancy Pelosi say...' 'why did so-and-so...' -- and I thought it'd be a real distraction."</p>

<h3><strong>At peace</strong></h3>

<p>Biden is expected to head off on holiday straight after his convention speech, sparing him the sight of thousands of delegates cheering the newly anointed Harris as the balloons fall.</p>

<p>Despite all that, Biden will still be welcomed by the party in Chicago. He will have a crucial role in pursuing the goal that he says was at the heart of his decision -- beating Trump.</p>

<p>"With some reflection, particularly if they win, he could come to a really comfortable position with his legacy and his decision," Casey Burgat of George Washington University told AFP.</p>

<p>His challenge will now be to give a speech that helps Harris, without burdening her with too much of his own administration's baggage.</p>

<p>The 59-year-old vice president is keen to blaze her own path, particularly on the issue of the economy, one of the areas that hit Biden's popularity hardest.</p>

<p>For Biden, it will be more of a valedictory turn.</p>

<p>"Maybe we'll see a Biden who is closer to being at peace with all of this than we might imagine," said Galston.</p>

<p>Biden is also expected to emphasize the idea of moving to a new generation -- especially since it is Republicans, with the 78-year-old Trump, who now have the oldest candidate in US history.</p>

<p>With Harris having wiped out Trump's lead in the polls, Democrats already view Biden more favorably than when he was their standard-bearer.</p>

<p>"He can expect a much warmer reception than if he'd stayed on, frankly," said Galston.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It was the early 1980s, and the Soviet Union had already invaded Afghanistan. The Cold War was at its peak. The Soviet Union and the United States worked on secret missions and operations to undermine each other. According to the CIA, spies working for Moscow had illegally acquired Western technology worth hundreds of millions of dollars in the late 1970s.<br />
<br />
But little did the leader of the Communist bloc know that the same process of acquisition of US technology would result in the delivery of sabotaged US high-tech. How did that happen, you ask? Let's find out. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
An FBI agent, who once saw an Austrian entrepreneur entering San Francisco's Soviet Consulate, had another chance encounter with the same man, this time at a bar. The agent, Rick Smith, and the man, whose name remains a mystery, would plant what remains a major counterintelligence campaign of the era, according to a report in <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/08/04/us-spies-soviet-technology-00164126">Politico Magazine.</a><br />
<br />
The Austrian man was already actively exporting American goods to European nations. The FBI believed the Soviet Union was always desperately looking for the latest and cutting-edge American technology. And that's how they dealt a major blow to their Communist opponents.<br />
<br />
As part of Operation Intering, the FBI and the Austrian "would seed faulty tech to Moscow and its allies", draining the Soviet Bloc's coffers. And it wasn't limited to just that. The operation would also expose Moscow's intelligence officers and people who conspired against America.<br />
<br />
It was all executed from the Austrian capital Vienna, believed to be a neutral ground for both Communist and Western officials to operate from. The Austrian sought and got an appointment with the Soviet Embassy where he was to pitch Moscow cutting-edge Silicon Valley microelectronics and computer technology.<br />
<br />
Initially, Moscow spies expressed some interest, "but they wanted classified information, basically," Smith said. However, the Communists directed the Austrian man to their allies -- the Bulgarians, and their East German and Russian allies, who were to get that forbidden tech. But not before the FBI tampered with it.<br />
<br />
While some tech was altered before Bulgarians received it, some were left completely unusable. However, to ensure the operation's longevity and avoid suspicion, some of the technology was delivered unadulterated.<br />
<br />
The FBI would also tamper with the electronics, which then experienced "chance" voltage overloads once plugged in by the Soviets. Apart from that some of the machines and parts were fiddled with such that they would degrade over time.<br />
<br />
The Soviet Bloc unknowingly purchased sabotaged US goods to the tune of millions of dollars. The Communist spies, who had no idea they were being played, were lauded for their "success in purchasing this forbidden technology from the West".<br />
<br />
However, it was only a matter of time before the Austrian's cover was blown, and then the Americans couldn't risk using him as an agent anymore. &nbsp;“He did all this for the sheer fun of doing it,” said Bill Kinane, a retired longtime San Francisco-based FBI counterintelligence agent who helped supervise the Intering operation. “And, like most Austrians, he hated the Russians.”<br />
<br />
After the Cold War, the Austrian reportedly moved back to Europe and amassed a huge fortune there in real estate.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many parents <a href="https://www.esafety.gov.au/research/parenting-digital-age">are worried</a> about their children using social media. But these concerns tend to focus on privacy, exposure to explicit material or contact with strangers.</p>

<p>As researchers looking at <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09540253.2023.2292622?src=exp-tr">sexism and misogyny in Australian schools</a> and the influence of social media, we think it is also important for parents to understand how algorithms work.</p>

<p>These can drive misogynistic content towards boys and young men and make extreme views seem normal.</p>

<h2>What does research say about social media?</h2>

<p>Researchers are increasingly studying how social media <a href="https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/232380/1/ZORA_4062.pdf">can amplify social and political divisions</a>. It is also <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7343248/">showing how</a> these platforms spread prejudice, hate speech and misinformation.</p>

<p>At the same time, researchers are <a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/news/masculinity-and-womens-equality-study-finds-emerging-gender-divide-in-young-peoples-attitudes">identifying a growing divide</a> between young men and women in their attitudes towards gender equality.</p>

<p>Our own <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09540253.2023.2292622?src=exp-tr">research</a> has found a disturbing increase in sexism, sexual harassment and misogyny in Australian schools. This includes examples of boys physically intimidating women teachers in schools, gaslighting them, saying they are “hysterical”, describing gender inequality issues as “myths”, and saying things like “Miss, your boobs look really big today”.</p>

<p>Similar examples emerged from <a href="https://theconversation.com/make-me-a-sandwich-our-surveys-disturbing-picture-of-how-some-boys-treat-their-teachers-228891">other Australian research</a> this year.</p>

<p>Our research, done via interviews with Australian teachers, suggests these views are influenced by the rise of figures from the “manosphere” (a collection of extreme men's communities that are anti-women) on social media.</p>

<h2>How do algorithms work?</h2>

<p>How are boys and young men coming into contact with this content? Algorithms play a <a href="https://theconversation.com/teens-see-social-media-algorithms-as-accurate-reflections-of-themselves-study-finds-226302#:%7E:text=In%20our%20qualitative%20interview%20study,seeing%20that%20social%20media%20reflection.">huge role</a> in what we all see online.</p>

<p>Algorithms are set up by human coders, but once operational they are automated pathways that direct content to social media users. They are optimised to get us to click, like, share and view content and keep coming back. This is the key commercial goal of the so-called “<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/curtsteinhorst/2024/02/06/lost-in-the-scroll-the-hidden-impact-of-the-attention-economy/">attention economy</a>”. The longer algorithms hold our attention, the more profit they generate for social media companies like Meta.</p>

<p>So, as a social media user demonstrates increasing interest in specific content or activities, they receive more of it.</p>

<h2>Boys are ‘fed' misogyny online</h2>

<p>Recent studies have shown us how boys and young men are being fed misogynistic content.</p>

<p>A 2022 <a href="https://www.isdglobal.org/isd-publications/algorithms-as-a-weapon-against-women-how-youtube-lures-boys-and-young-men-into-the-manosphere/">Australian study</a> set up ten experimental YouTube accounts. These included profiles of four boys under 18, four young men over 18 and two blank control accounts.</p>

<p>It showed boys and young men were lured to the manosphere through “recommended video” features that pop up. On YouTube shorts (which feature shorter videos) this phenomenon was worse. The study found the algorithm was seen to:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>optimise more aggressively in response to user behaviour and show more extreme videos within a relatively brief time frame.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A 2024 <a href="https://antibullyingcentre.ie/recommending-toxicity-how-tiktok-and-youtube-shorts-are-bombarding-boys-and-men-with-misogynist-content/">Irish study</a> made similar findings.</p>

<p>Researchers created ten fake profiles for TikTok and YouTube shorts on ten blank smartphones. On the two different platforms, the researchers created accounts for a 16- and 18-year-old boy who sought content typically associated with masculine gender norms for their age (such as the gym, sport and video games), a 16- and 18- year-old boy who sought manosphere content, and one blank control account.</p>

<p>Misogynist manosphere content was sent to users regardless of whether those accounts actively searched for it. This was especially the case for the profiles set up as teenage boys seeking out content typically associated with masculine gender norms.

<figcaption><span class="caption">Research has shown how algorithms drive misogynistic content towards young men, whether they seek it or not.</span> <span class="attribution"><a class="source" href="https://unsplash.com/photos/man-wearing-black-and-red-pullover-hoodie-eNyXK17so6A">Ben den Engelsen/Unsplash</a>, <a class="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC BY</a></span></figcaption>

<h2>How does misogynist content radicalise boys?</h2>

<p>We believe what is occurring is very serious. In our research we use the term “<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/09540253.2023.2292622">misogynist radicalisation</a>” to describe what is happening to some boys and young men.</p>

<p>This phrase was selected to capture a stark and sudden shift in boys' attitudes and behaviour towards women and girls in Australian schools, which teachers report occurred at the return from lockdown and remote schooling.</p>

<p>Although “radicalisation” is typically used to refer to the process of being recruited to religious or political terrorist ideology, <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/1057610X.2024.2318813">research</a> has identified misogyny as a feature of right-wing terrorism.</p>

<p>At the same time, the “<a href="https://theconversation.com/incel-violence-is-a-form-of-extremism-its-time-we-treated-it-as-a-security-threat-138536">incel</a>” (or involuntary celibate) community is also being seen as a <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09546553.2023.2296515">possible terrorist threat</a>. Incels, who are mostly men and boys, blame and resent women for their own inability to find a sexual partner.</p>

<p>We also know <a href="https://theconversation.com/stopping-violence-against-women-starts-with-learning-what-misogyny-really-is-175411">misogyny</a> perpetuates gender inequity and biases that underpin violence against women.</p>

<p>While we are not suggesting boys and young people who are influenced by extremist misogynist ideology will all become violent or <a href="https://spir.aoir.org/ojs/index.php/spir/article/view/12174">recruited to other extremist groups</a>, it is important to consider misogyny as both a form of extremism and as an ideology.</p>

<p>Research <a href="https://www.womensaid.org.uk/womens-aid-publishes-groundbreaking-research-looking-at-what-influences-children-and-young-peoples-understanding-of-domestic-abuse/">shows</a> young people who view misogynist content are likely to harbour unhealthy views on relationships. A 2024 UK <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/20563051241228811">study on teenagers</a> also found “manfluencer” Andrew Tate's content is emotionally engaging for boys and young men. It encourages feelings of fear and anger as well as belief in myths about gender equity.</p>

<h2>What can parents of boys do?</h2>

<p>An outright ban for young people is not necessarily the right step to take (even if <a href="https://theconversation.com/tech-solutions-to-limit-kids-access-to-social-media-are-fraught-with-problems-including-privacy-risks-231696">such a ban could work</a>). Research <a href="https://www.esafety.gov.au/research/being-a-young-man-online">tells us</a> social media is an important space for young men to explore their identities, interests and establish connections with others.</p>

<p>So we need education both for parents and young people about how algorithms shape the feeds of young people's social media accounts, and how this content can <a href="https://lens.monash.edu/@education/2024/04/29/1386672/post-truth-politics-and-manosphere-extremists-in-australian-schools">deliberately</a> exploit their emotions and beliefs.</p>

<p>One <a href="https://www.esafety.gov.au/parents/issues-and-advice/hard-to-have-conversations">key thing</a> parents can do is initiate open, respectful conversations with their children about what they are viewing online.</p>

<p>These conversations should be free of judgement or reprimand and allow children to describe what they are seeing and why it might interest them. Open-ended questions that encourage your children to express their views are a good place to start. For example, “Can you tell me a little about about X? What's interesting about their content?”</p>

<p>Judgement-free conversations are important so young people don't fear bringing up difficult experiences. If you are going to be critical of something, try and do this together, with children contributing to explanations of whether specific content can be harmful and to whom.</p>

<p>You can also talk about the implications of “<a href="https://theconversation.com/explainer-how-facebook-has-become-the-worlds-largest-echo-chamber-91024">echo chambers</a>” and how these are generated by algorithms. Some examples might include: “Do you notice you're seeing a lot of content by one particular creator? Or on one particular topic?” or “How does the content you are seeing make you feel?”.</p>

<p>There are also lots of useful organisations providing specific advice for parents around <a href="https://www.childnet.com/blog/algorithms/">algorithms</a> and <a href="https://www.esafety.gov.au/parents/issues-and-advice/online-safety-basics">general safety</a> online.</p>

<h2>Watch and listen</h2>

<p>Also, be on the look out for any changes in a child's behaviour and attitudes towards women and girls.</p>

<p>Are there certain terms they are using that did not before? How do they react if certain figures in the news or popular culture come up in conversations? How are they relating to women and girls in their family and social circles? Do you find them expressing opinions that are not aligned with your family values?</p>

<p>If teachers approach you about problems with your child's behaviour at school towards women and girls, try to be open to the conversation (rather than dismiss it as impossible). It is likely what parents see and hear is different to school and online contexts. Indeed, some teachers in our <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00220620.2024.2316620?src=recsys">study</a> reported boys expressed different versions of themselves and different views, depending on the audience.</p>

<p>If you do notice your child is expressing some concerning views, as well as initiating an open, calm discussion with them, we recommend contacting your child's teachers or school wellbeing team. You can also seek support and advice from the <a href="https://www.esafety.gov.au/parents">eSafety Commissioner</a>.<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The head of the World Health Organization on Thursday called for increased production of cholera vaccines, highlighting what he called a "critical shortage" around the globe.</p>

<p>The UN health agency said 307,433 cases of cholera and 2,326 deaths have been reported in 26 countries up to July 28.</p>

<p>"The response continues to be affected by a critical shortage of the vaccine, as demand continues to outpace supply," WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on X, formerly Twitter.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Since the beginning of the year, over 300,000 people have gotten sick with <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/cholera?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#cholera</a> and over 2300 died from it.<br />
<br />
The response continues to be affected by a critical shortage of the vaccine, as demand continues to outpace supply, with 105 million doses requested by 18 countries… <a href="https://t.co/RknHN8ih8D">pic.twitter.com/RknHN8ih8D</a></p>
— Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus (@DrTedros) <a href="https://twitter.com/DrTedros/status/1824100143081071040?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 15, 2024</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Some 105 million doses have been requested by 18 countries since January 2023 -- but only 55 million doses have been produced in the same period, Tedros added.</p>

<p>In a fresh situation update, the WHO said that between January and May 2024, the oral cholera vaccine stockpile "was entirely depleted".</p>

<p>Tedros urged "further investment in scaling up vaccine production", and called on all countries to spend more on "water and sanitation, and emergency preparedness to prevent further outbreaks".</p>

<p>The eastern Mediterranean region, Africa and Southeast Asia have recorded the highest numbers of cases, said the WHO, which considers the global risk from cholera to be "very high" due to the growing number of cases and the shortage of vaccines.</p>

<p>The WHO says that after decades of progress against cholera, cases have been on the rise again since 2021, including in countries that had not seen the disease in years.</p>

<p>The cases registered so far should be interpreted cautiously due to potential reporting delays, the WHO said.</p>

<p>The disease, which causes severe diarrhoea, vomiting and muscle cramps, generally arises from eating or drinking food or water that is contaminated with the bacterium, according to the WHO.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Turning heads as they cruise past office buildings and malls, driverless taxis are slowly spreading through Chinese cities, prompting both wariness and wonder.</p>

<p>China's tech companies and automakers have poured billions of dollars into self-driving technology in recent years in an effort to catch industry leaders in the United States.</p>

<p>Now the central city of Wuhan boasts one of the world's largest networks of self-driving cars, home to a fleet of over 500 taxis that can be hailed on an app just like regular rides.</p>

<p>At one intersection in an industrial area of Wuhan, AFP reporters saw at least five robotaxis passing each other as they navigated regular traffic.</p>

<p>"It looks kind of magical, like a sci-fi movie," a local surnamed Yang told AFP.</p>

<p>But not everyone shares Yang's awe.</p>

<p>Debates around safety was sparked in April when a Huawei-backed Aito car was involved in a fatal accident, with the company saying its automatic braking system failed.</p>

<p>A minor collision between a jaywalker and a Wuhan robotaxi last month re-ignited concerns.</p>

<p>Taxi drivers and workers in traditional ride-hailing companies have also raised fears of being replaced by artificial intelligence -- although the technology is far from fully developed.</p>

<h3><strong>Five to 500</strong></h3>

<p>Wuhan's driverless cabs are part of tech giant Baidu's Apollo Go project, which first received licences to operate in the city in 2022.</p>

<p>Initially, only five robocars ferried passengers around 13 square kilometres (five square miles) of the city of around 14 million.</p>

<p>Baidu says the taxis now operate in a 3,000 square kilometre patch -- more than a third of the total land area of Wuhan, including a small part of the city centre.</p>

<p>In comparison, US leader Waymo says the largest area it covers is 816 square kilometres, in Arizona.</p>

<p>When a car reaches its pickup point, riders scan a QR code with their phones to unlock the vehicle -- with the front seats blocked off over safety concerns.</p>

<p>The fares are currently heavily discounted, with a thirty-minute ride taken by AFP costing just 39 yuan ($5.43) compared with 64 yuan in a normal taxi.</p>

<p>"They are stealing our rice bowls, so of course we don't like them," Wuhan taxi driver Deng Haibing told AFP, using a popular Chinese term for livelihoods.</p>

<p>Deng said he fears robotaxi companies will push traditional drivers out of business with subsidised fares, before raising prices once they achieve domination -- similar to the strategy employed by ride-hailing apps in the 2010s.</p>

<p>"Currently the impact isn't too big because robotaxis aren't fully popularised and can't drive everywhere yet," Deng said.</p>

<h3><strong>'Simply not ready'</strong></h3>

<p>The robotaxi fleet is a tiny fraction of the tens of thousands of taxis and ride-hailing cars in Wuhan.</p>

<p>More and more Chinese cities are rolling out policies to promote self-driving services though, as part of a national push for tech supremacy.</p>

<p>Baidu and domestic rival Pony.ai have for years tested models of varying autonomy levels in industrial parks around the country.</p>

<p>Shanghai issued its first batch of provisional permits for fully driverless cars last month, and the capital Beijing has approved fully autonomous robotaxis in suburban areas.</p>

<p>The southwest city of Chongqing and the southern tech hub of Shenzhen also have pilot projects underway.</p>

<p>Technology-wise, there's still a long way to go before self-driving taxis become ubiquitous though, according to Tom Nunlist, tech policy analyst at Trivium China.</p>

<p>"Everybody seems to think autonomous driving is inevitable at this point, and frankly, I don't know that it is," he told AFP.</p>

<p>"Presently fully autonomous driving tech is simply not ready for large-scale deployment," he said.</p>

<p>Even in Wuhan's Apollo Go taxis -- which can spot obstacles and wait scrupulously at intersections -- ultimate responsibility for safety still lies with human officers monitoring rides remotely.</p>

<p>During one ride in an Apollo Go car, one manipulated the car's built-in touchscreen to remind AFP reporters to put on their seatbelts.</p>

<p>"Safety personnel provide strong assurances for your ride via remote 5G assistance technology," the Apollo Go app tells users.</p>

<p>Robotaxis are also far from able to replicate the human touch.</p>

<p>"Some customers have disabilities and (driverless cars) definitely wouldn't be able to help them, and some passengers are carrying large items," ride-hailing driver Zhao told AFP.</p>

<p>"Only a human can help."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week marked 75 years since the adoption of the <a href="https://www.icrc.org/en/document/geneva-conventions-1949-additional-protocols#:%7E:text=The%20Convention%20adopted%20in%201949%20takes%20account%20of,War%20II.%20It%20is%20composed%20of%20159%20articles.">Geneva Conventions</a> on August 12 1949. In theory, these rules of war are universally agreed by every nation. In practice, they are routinely violated everywhere.</p>

<p>With an estimated <a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/world/how-term-armed-conflict-defined-international-humanitarian-law">120 armed conflicts worldwide</a>, more than 450 armed groups and 195 million people <a href="https://blogs.icrc.org/law-and-policy/wp-content/uploads/sites/102/2023/10/ICRC-engagement-with-armed-groups-in-2023-Humanitarian-Law-Policy-Blog.pdfwith-armed-groups-in-2023-Humanitarian-Law-Policy-Blog.pdf">living in areas under their control</a>, the protection of the vulnerable is as vitally important as ever.</p>

<p>As the news headlines remind us daily, however, international humanitarian law can seem like too little, too late when faced with military might and political indifference.</p>

<p>This year also marks other, less hopeful, anniversaries: ten years since the <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2024/08/ten-years-after-yazidi-genocide-un-syria-commission-inquiry-calls-justice">genocide against the Yazidi</a> by ISIS in Syria, and ten years of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/23/world/europe/ukraine-russia-war-maidan-square.html">war in Ukraine</a>. Geopolitical tensions are escalating in the Middle East and the South China Sea.</p>

<p>Given the modern technologies used on today's battlefields (and in cyberspace), and the violation of even basic humanitarian protections, is there much to celebrate in 2024? Are the Geneva Conventions <a href="https://blogs.icrc.org/law-and-policy/2024/08/08/wars-long-legacy-the-continued-importance-of-the-geneva-conventions-75-years-later/">still fit for purpose</a> for today's wars – and tomorrow's?</p>

<h2>Humanitarian values</h2>

<p>All societies have cultural, religious or legal rules of some kind around war. But in the aftermath of World War II's extreme horrors, the world agreed to a detailed set of codified rules governing armed conflict.</p>

<p>Despite differing political views and experiences of war, countries agreed to the Geneva Convention rules by striking a balance between military need and humanitarian ideals for the treatment of civilians, captured enemy soldiers and the dead.</p>

<p>The 1949 Conventions remain the core of international humanitarian law, or the laws of armed conflict. This body of law has been expanded over the years by other treaties and protocols dealing with civil war, chemical weapons, antipersonnel landmines, torture and enforced disappearances.</p>

<p>Designed to help prevent a spiral of tit-for-tat atrocities, many of the rules work due to reciprocal respect between combatants: treat our soldiers well when captured and we will do likewise.</p>

<p>But they also demand the humane treatment of people caught up in war, even if one warring party has breached those rules or started the war in violation of the <a href="https://www.un.org/en/about-us/un-charter">United Nations Charter</a> that prohibits aggression.</p>

<h2>Four conventions, 400 articles</h2>

<p>The Geneva Conventions include more than 400 articles, setting out detailed rules for the treatment of prisoners, protecting hospitals and medical staff, allowing humanitarian aid, and prohibiting torture, rape and sexual violence.</p>

<p>In fact, four conventions were adopted in 1949. The first three's provisions built on existing laws protecting wounded soldiers on the battlefield, at sea and when captured as prisoners.</p>

<p>The key fourth convention sought to protect civilians living under the power of an adversary, such as in occupied territory.</p>

<p>A single article provided fundamental rules about the humane treatment of people during a civil war – the first time international law had dared to regulate violence occurring within a country rather than between two or more.</p>

<h2>War and peace</h2>

<p>Some say international humanitarian law took the wrong approach back in the 1860s when the very first Geneva Convention was adopted, because it accepted war and <a href="https://criticallegalthinking.com/2022/11/22/a-few-not-too-troublesome-restrictions-humanitarianism-solidarity-anti-militarism-peace/">gave up on insisting on peace</a>.</p>

<p>As the scholar <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/culture/samuel-moyn-humane-interview/">Samuel Moyn has argued</a>, this has forced us to choose between the ideal of opposing war in the first place and opposing the crimes that take place within it.</p>

<p>Humanitarian law also accepts a minimum level of harm to civilians as “collateral damage” during an attack on a military target. In other words, not all civilian deaths are war crimes.</p>

<p>And some articles in the conventions seem old-fashioned today – tobacco is mentioned together with food and water for prisoners of war, for example.</p>

<p>But in my own experience working with the International Committee of the Red Cross, I have seen international humanitarian law in action. When respected, it can save and improve lives.</p>

<h2>Eternal vigilance</h2>

<p>Warring parties everywhere still allow the Red Cross to visit thousands of detained people, and to negotiate about improving their treatment.</p>

<p>Combatants make agreements for prisoner swaps, hostage release, return of the dead, and the provision of medical care to wounded enemy soldiers.</p>

<p>Sometimes, countries investigate war crimes allegations. And the conventions make it possible for warring parties to make other agreements for even greater protections.</p>

<p>And while the Geneva Conventions, and international humanitarian law more generally, are far from perfect, the rules seek a basic limit on the worst humanity has to offer, insisting on some fundamental human dignity.</p>

<p>To ensure they are at least not actively breached, and ideally their protections extended, countries must do three key things:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>focus on collective responsibility, comply with the law themselves, and <a href="https://theconversation.com/gaza-war-countries-selling-israel-weapons-are-violating-international-law-legal-expert-227091">ensure respect by others</a></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>stop using technical legal arguments to legitimise large-scale devastation in ways that ignore <a href="https://www.justsecurity.org/97582/war-law/">the fundamental humanitarian purpose</a> of the rules</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>and resist any claim by a nation state that exceptional national security threats (including terrorism, insurgency or new technologies) justify <a href="https://www.icrc.org/en/news-release/times-insecurity-and-conflict-states-must-work-together">the rules being abandoned</a>.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>It is precisely in the gravest situations, when politics and other laws have failed to prevent war, that these rules are most needed. Greater respect for them would go a long way to saving lives and preventing the horrors we see in today's conflicts.<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.

       <description><![CDATA[Out of over 10,000 Palestinian applications, only 2922 were approved, while nearly 8750 Israeli visas were granted following the October 7 attacks.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The air and ground operation has killed more than 40,000 people in Gaza, according to the Hamas-ruled territory's health ministry. After Palestinian terrorist group Hamas carried out the deadliest attack in Israeli history on October 7, 2023, Israel responded with a devastating military campaign in Gaza.</p>

<p>As a result, the number of Palestinians fleeing to other nations seeking refuge-including Australia-has increased. But there's a sharp difference in Australia when it comes to visa approval statistics; most Palestinian applications are turned down, but a disproportionately high number of Israeli visas are approved.</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.news.com.au/national/politics/majority-of-palestinians-fleeing-gaza-to-australia-have-had-their-visas-refused/news-story/cccaed5acd91f8a5bc83d0a4e54ad2a4"><em>News Corp Australia,</em></a> Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke has confirmed that out of the 10,033 applications launched in the past 10 months, 7111 were rejected, while 2922 Palestinians were granted entry into Australia. Out of the 2922 figure, about 1300 refugees have resettled into Australia, who are understood to largely be on short-term visas.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, 8746 Israeli citizens have been granted visas since the October 7 attacks, with 235 applications rejected.</p>

<p>The report was released concurrently with calls by main opposition leader Peter Dutton to stop the entry of Palestinians from Gaza on the grounds that they were a threat to national security.</p>

<p>"I don't think people should be coming in from that war zone at all at the moment," Dutton said on Wednesday. "It's not prudent to do so, and I think it puts our national security at risk."</p>

<p>His remarks were a reaction to what happened on Tuesday, when Coalition Members of Parliament wrote to Tony Burke, urging him to tighten the process of evaluating visa applications from Gaza to make sure they had no support for Hamas. As it stands, applicants are only rejected if they are found to have given financial or material support to Hamas.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[From an economic perspective, the concerns around the AI bubble mirror those seen in past tech booms, such as the "dot-com bubble" of the late 1990s.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is widely regarded as a revolutionary technology, fuelling growth in various sectors and creating a surge in demand for specialised hardware, particularly from companies like Nvidia. <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2024/08/07/is-the-ai-bubble-about-to-burst/">According to <em>Forbes</em></a>, Nvidia's stock price has more than tripled in a year. Other tech giants like Google and Microsoft, invested heavily in AI, have also seen large increases. However, alongside the excitement, concerns have been growing about the sustainability of the AI boom, raising the spectre of a potential bubble bursting.</p>

<h3><strong>The Rise Of Nvidia: From Chipmaker To AI Giant</strong></h3>

<p>Nvidia has become a poster child for the AI boom, primarily due to its dominance in the graphics processing unit (GPU) market, which is essential for AI training and inference tasks. The company briefly became the world's most valuable firm in June 2024, dethroning Microsoft, largely due to skyrocketing demand for AI chips. Its market capitalisation hit $3.33 trillion due to the stellar rise in its stock price. Nvidia's GPUs power the development of AI models, enabling breakthroughs in machine learning, natural language processing and other cutting-edge technologies.</p>

<p>However, Nvidia's meteoric rise has also led to concerns. Analysts have pointed out that much of Nvidia's value is tied to the belief that AI's economic potential will continue to expand exponentially. Some worry that if this expectation does not materialise, Nvidia's stock could suffer significantly, potentially signalling the burst of the AI bubble.</p>

<h3><strong>Demand And Supply Dynamics</strong></h3>

<p>The demand for AI-related hardware, especially GPUs, has far outstripped supply, with companies across the globe investing heavily in AI infrastructure. Major cloud service providers, often referred to as "hyperscalers", have placed massive orders for Nvidia's GPUs, hoping to bolster their AI capabilities. This rush has created supply chain bottlenecks, leading to rising prices and longer lead times for essential components.</p>

<p>Despite the high demand, some industry insiders are questioning whether this level of investment is sustainable. Hedge fund Elliott Management, for instance, said it was "sceptical" that Big Tech companies would keep buying the chipmaker's graphics processing units in such high volumes, and that AI is "overhyped with many applications not ready for prime time", per a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ft.com/content/24a12be1-a973-4efe-ab4f-b981aee0cd0b"><em>Financial Times</em> report</a>. The company also pointed out that AI technology consumes significant amounts of power, making some applications prohibitively expensive in the long run.</p>

<h3><strong>Power Requirements And Sustainability Concerns</strong></h3>

<p>Another critical issue is the power consumption associated with AI technologies. Training large AI models requires vast amounts of computational power, which, in turn, demands enormous energy resources. Data centres housing thousands of GPUs have to be cooled and powered continuously, leading to concerns about the environmental impact of AI expansion. Nvidia shipped 100,000 units last year expected to consume 7.3 times of energy annually.</p>

<p>The energy consumption of AI models is becoming a point of contention, as stakeholders weigh the benefits of AI against its sustainability. Some experts believe that as AI technologies mature, they will become more efficient, reducing their environmental footprint. However, others are sceptical, arguing that the demands of AI will only increase as more complex models are developed.</p>

<h3><strong>Economic Theories And The AI Bubble</strong></h3>

<p>From an economic perspective, the concerns around the AI bubble mirror those seen in past tech booms. When demand for a particular technology skyrockets, driven by expectations of future profitability, it often leads to inflated valuations of companies associated with that technology. This dynamic has been observed in other periods of technological euphoria, such as the "dot-com bubble" of the late 1990s.</p>

<p>In the case of AI, many investors are betting heavily on the technology's future potential, often without a clear understanding of how or when these investments will generate returns. The economic principle of supply and demand suggests that if AI cannot meet the lofty expectations set for it, the resulting disappointment could lead to a sharp correction in the market. This is particularly relevant to companies like Nvidia, whose fortunes are closely tied to the success of AI.</p>

<p>Additionally, as more players enter the AI hardware market, competition could increase, leading to lower prices and thinner profit margins. This could further destabilise the market, especially if the anticipated demand for AI technologies does not materialise as expected.</p>

<h3><strong>Is The AI Boom Sustainable?</strong></h3>

<p>The AI industry continues to attract massive investments, and Nvidia's growth has been a significant beneficiary of this trend. However, experts caution that this surge in interest may not be sustainable in the long term. Companies are spending billions on AI research, hardware, and applications, yet the commercial viability of many AI solutions remains uncertain. Furthermore, the power requirements and environmental impact of AI technologies present additional challenges.</p>

<p>For now, AI remains the hottest trend in technology, with Nvidia at the centre of this boom. But as history has shown with previous tech bubbles, rapid growth can sometimes be followed by an equally dramatic collapse.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The mpox outbreak in Africa is yet another example of how infectious diseases perceived to be "someone elses problem", and affecting mainly poor, developing countries, may suddenly pose unexpected global threats.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://africacdc.org/news-item/africa-cdc-declares-mpox-a-public-health-emergency-of-continental-security-mobilizing-resources-across-the-continent/">mpox outbreak</a> in Africa is yet another example of how infectious diseases perceived to be “someone else's problem”, and affecting mainly poor, developing countries, may suddenly pose unexpected global threats.</p>

<p>Other examples of neglected diseases include the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/west-nile-virus/about/index.html">West Nile</a>, <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/zika-virus">Zika</a> and <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/chikungunya/about/index.html#:%7E:text=Key%20points,is%20recommended%20for%20some%20travelers.">Chikungunya</a> viruses.</p>

<p>Mpox was discovered in <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3635111/">1958</a> (in captive monkeys, hence the original misnomer “monkeypox”) and the first human case was identified in <a href="https://www.nicd.ac.za/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/mpox-FAQ_May_24JW.pdf">1970</a>. Then for decades it was largely neglected by the scientific and public health communities, regarded as an uncommon infection in remote rural areas in tropical Africa without relevance for the rest of the world.</p>

<p>When a massive mpox outbreak hit developed countries in <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/situations/monkeypox-oubreak-2022">2022</a>, increased research funding led to a surge in scientific studies. On just one medical search engine, <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Pubmed&amp;rlz=1C1GCEA_enZA1069ZA1069&amp;oq=Pubmed&amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIGCAEQRRg80gEJMTM2MWowajE1qAIIsAIB&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">there's been more research produced</a> since April 2022 than in the preceding 60 years.</p>

<p>The 2022-23 global mpox outbreak happened despite repeated calls from African researchers for increased global investment in diagnostic, therapeutic and infection prevention tools for mpox.</p>

<p>The WHO has now <a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/14-08-2024-who-director-general-declares-mpox-outbreak-a-public-health-emergency-of-international-concern">declared</a> the current upsurge of mpox in central Africa a public health emergency of international concern.</p>

<p>This is the highest alert level for events that constitute a public health risk to other countries and requires a coordinated international response.</p>

<p>We are infectious disease researchers who have worked on HIV, SARS-CoV-2 and other viral infections.</p>

<p>Mpox's recent history is yet another reminder that an infectious disease in one corner of the world should not be regarded as someone else's problem, as it can suddenly start to spread fast and far.</p>

<p>It also highlights global inequities in resource allocation and access to vaccines, diagnostics and treatments. These were made available in many industrialised countries and helped curb the global outbreak, but are still largely lacking in most of Africa.</p>

<h2>The 2022 outbreak: a total surprise</h2>

<p>The disease has been renamed “mpox” but the name of the virus, for now, remains “monkeypox” (MPXV). It is closely related to the smallpox virus.</p>

<p>MPXV was considered a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10257565/">zoonotic disease</a> endemic in parts of <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9643038/">central and west Africa</a>. It was acquired mainly through close contact with wild mammals, especially handling bush meat, but there was no sustained human-to-human transmission.</p>

<p>Only very occasionally were cases seen outside the endemic areas, due to infected travellers or import of infected small mammals.</p>

<p>This changed abruptly in 2022: a massive, rapidly evolving global outbreak caused over <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/08/1153141">99,000</a> laboratory-confirmed cases in 116 countries. At its peak in August 2022, over 6,000 cases were reported each week.</p>

<p>This outbreak came as a total surprise: most cases were reported from non-endemic countries, mostly in <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9264731/">men who have sex with men</a> who had become infected during recent sexual encounters.</p>

<p>Even though most cases were clinically not particularly severe and the death toll stands at just over <a href="https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/158322">200</a>, the global outbreak was declared a public health emergency of international concern by the World Health Organization on 23 July 2022.</p>

<p>Fortunately, case numbers soon plummeted due to a combination of behavioural changes and vaccination in at-risk groups.</p>

<p>Modern vaccines and antiviral drugs with activity against mpox were made available in many affected high-income countries.</p>

<p>These had been developed and stockpiled in the US and Europe, mostly in preparation for a potential bioweapon attack using a poxvirus.</p>

<p>The global outbreak in 2022 was caused by <a href="https://www.ijidonline.com/article/S1201-9712(24)00230-3/fulltext">clade II of MPXV</a>, which is endemic in west Africa and not as virulent as <a href="https://www.ijidonline.com/article/S1201-9712(24)00230-3/fulltext">clade I MPXV</a>, which so far has only been seen in the Congo Basin.</p>

<p>That first mpox public health emergency of international concern was declared over in May 2023.</p>

<p>Clade II MPXV infections are still occurring globally, but the worst seems over – for now.</p>

<p>Complacency would be misguided, as illustrated by the current mpox outbreak that is gathering steam.</p>

<h2>Upsurge in Africa</h2>

<p>The African region is experiencing an upsurge in mpox cases which started in 2023.</p>

<p>As the continent which includes the areas where mpox has been endemic for a long time, Africa now presents a complex mosaic:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>cases arising from the endemic, largely zoonotic, pattern that used to be predominant in the past</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>cases linked to the 2022 global outbreak, for example in South Africa</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>most worryingly, ever increasing numbers of MPXV clade Ib infections reported from the Democratic Republic of Congo.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>New, more dangerous strain</h2>

<p>The current clade I MPXV (formerly called Congo Basin strain) is more virulent than the clade II (west African) strain, resulting in a higher case fatality rate.</p>

<p>The ongoing outbreak has its epicentre in <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2024-DON522">South Kivu</a> province, eastern DRC, and has the potential to fuel a large pandemic.</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>It has a distinct epidemiological pattern with sustained chains of human-to-human transmission, often via the sexual route.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>It may have increased transmissibility (we don't know yet).</p>

	<p>The virus which causes it is the newly defined clade Ib lineage. It displays mutations that are the hallmark of human-to-human spread that is estimated to have been happening since September 2023.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Case numbers are rising rapidly, even though many suspected cases are likely not tested and thus not counted as confirmed. Complicating matters, a commonly used test was found to miss infections with this lineage of the virus.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>It affects mostly adults.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The case fatality rate is higher than it was in the 2022 global outbreak.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Already, this outbreak has resulted in mpox cases occurring in several neighbouring countries, including some (like Kenya) with no previous record of mpox.</p>

<p>The challenge is enormous. The eastern DRC is an area beset by multiple problems. This <a href="https://www.afro.who.int/health-topics/disease-outbreaks/outbreaks-and-other-emergencies-updates?page=0">includes</a> natural disasters, violence and infectious diseases including measles, cholera and poliomyelitis for the DRC.</p>

<p>In recent years the <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/situations/Ebola-2019-drc-">second-largest Ebola outbreak</a> ever took place in the wider area and, despite the availability of vaccines and treatments, posed considerable challenges.</p>

<h2>What needs to happen</h2>

<p>A recent <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(24)00187-6/fulltext">article</a> we co-authored in The Lancet Global Health outlines what needs to be done to contain this outbreak and prevent it from turning into an epidemic, possibly even a pandemic.</p>

<p>Equitable access to diagnostic tests, vaccines and antiviral treatments requires political commitment and financial investments.</p>

<p>Scientific investigations are needed to learn more about exposure settings, transmission routes and clinical presentations.</p>

<p>It's important to find the best ways to make these interventions.</p>

<p>We have proposed the establishment of an African-led, multidisciplinary, multi-country Mpox Research Consortium (MpoxReC) in Africa.</p>

<p>It should conduct research towards the elimination of mpox as a public health problem.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that a disease in one corner of the world can suddenly become a global heath threat. It's time the global health system woke up to this reality.<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/moon/what-is-a-supermoon/">supermoon</a> may sound exciting, but it's a modest coincidence.</p>

<p>As the Moon orbits Earth, its distance from us varies from 357,000 to 407,000 kilometres. When the Moon and the Sun are in almost opposite directions from Earth, we get a full moon. A “supermoon” is a full moon where its position along its orbit is within 10% of its closest approach to Earth. That's it.</p>

<p>This means a supermoon has an apparent diameter that's 14% larger than the smallest possible full moon. That's not a lot. You can't really notice the difference by eye.</p>

<p>As an astronomer, I have a problem with supermoons. There are genuine wonders to see in the night sky, so don't be disappointed by a dull, overhyped supermoon.</p>

<h2>When is the best time to view the Moon?</h2>

<p>Articles hyping supermoons are easy. ChatGPT can do it. Say it's the first supermoon since whenever, add some superlatives, and throw in a telephoto lens photo of a full moon with a landmark. Perhaps the supermoon coincides with another otherwise normal full moon, so it can be a “<a href="https://moon.nasa.gov/news/197/super-blue-moons-your-questions-answered/">blue supermoon</a>” or a “<a href="https://www.accuweather.com/en/space-news/super-worm-moon-how-to-see-the-final-full-moon-of-winter/695656">worm supermoon</a>” or whatever.</p>

<p>It's still just a full moon.</p>

<p>If you do want to look at the Moon and it happens to be a supermoon, go for it. But there are better times to admire our only natural satellite, particularly with binoculars or a telescope.</p>

<p>The best time to look at the Moon is when its shadows, as seen from Earth, are longest. These long shadows help the craters and mountains stand out from the surrounding plains, so you can appreciate the dramatic landscape of our neighbouring world.</p>

<p>The shadows are longest when the Moon appears as a half moon in the night sky. During a full moon or a supermoon the shadows are at their shortest – not nearly as impressive.</p>

<p>In fact, astronomers prefer to avoid nights with supermoons and catch up on lost sleep. Full moons flood the night sky with light and make it harder to view more subtle and interesting sights.</p>

<p>Want to look at the grand expanse of the Milky Way with the unaided eye? Want to see a meteor shower, comet or aurora? Best done without a damn supermoon.</p>

<p>It can be fun to see something truly rare or unusual in the sky. But supermoons don't qualify for that either. Using the definition I mentioned earlier, there are typically three or four supermoons each year. More restrictive definitions give us one or two supermoons per year. Not only is that not rare, it still just looks like a full moon.</p>

<p>There are rarer celestial events that really can inspire. Millions of people across the globe saw <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/science-research/heliophysics/how-nasa-tracked-the-most-intense-solar-storm-in-decades/">bright auroras in May 2024</a>, including places where truly spectacular auroras are few and far between.</p>

<p>Comets can also be wonderful. Every decade or so, a comet swings into the inner Solar System and produces a bright tail, millions of kilometres long and visible from Earth. Back when I was a student, I saw <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_Hyakutake">Comet Hyakutake's bright blue tail</a> stretch across a huge expanse of sky. Sometimes comets fizzle, but when they're great they are amazing.</p>

<h2>Want something impressive? Try an eclipse</h2>

<p>Auroras and comets can be fickle, but eclipses are predictable and put on a reliable show.</p>

<p>Take total solar eclipses, when the Moon covers the Sun and day turns briefly into night. Thousands travel across the globe to see them. I will be travelling to New South Wales for the <a href="https://eclipse.asa.astronomy.org.au/eclipse-australia-2028/">2028 eclipse</a>.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For more than a decade, researchers and journalists have relied on a digital tool called CrowdTangle to track and fight the spread of viral falsehoods online.</p>

<p>But earlier this week, the owner of CrowdTangle, Meta, <a href="https://transparency.meta.com/en-gb/researchtools/other-datasets/crowdtangle/">shut the tool down</a>. The tech giant has replaced it with its new Content Library, which it says will serve the same purpose and be “<a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2023/11/new-tools-to-support-independent-research/">more user friendly</a>”.</p>

<p>As long-time users of CrowdTangle to track and analyse online misinformation campaigns, we are sceptical of this claim. We are also very concerned by the fact CrowdTangle's closure comes at a time when misinformation on social media is rife – and is bound to worsen in the lead up to the November presidential election in the United States.</p>

<p>So, why did Meta decide to close CrowdTangle now? And how will this affect the fight against the spread of misinformation and disinformation online?</p>

<h2>CrowdTangle: a tried and trusted tool</h2>

<p>Founded in 2011, CrowdTangle quickly gained popularity among media outlets which used it to track and analyse trending topics and articles on social media platforms for commercial purposes. Facebook (as Meta was then called) <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/11/13594338/facebook-acquires-crowdtangle">purchased the company five years later</a>.</p>

<p>There were several reasons why CrowdTangle was a powerful tool for researchers like us who study the spread of misinformation and disinformation online. Firstly, we could download large datasets to use for computational modelling and other forms of analysis. The data was also easily searchable using keywords.</p>

<p>We could also use CrowdTangle to automatically analyse trends in large collections of data from multiple sources.</p>

<p>These features helped us <a href="https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/19312">analyse the influence of far-right accounts</a> on Facebook during the COVID pandemic. They also helped us analyse the effectiveness (or lack thereof) of Meta's content moderation policies in <a href="https://theconversation.com/conspiracy-theorist-tactics-show-its-too-easy-to-get-around-facebooks-content-policies-226118">curbing the spread of vaccine misinformation</a>.</p>

<p>But CrowdTangle was not a vital tool only for researchers like us.</p>

<p>Journalists at the New York Times used it to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/14/technology/facebook-data.html">expose the influence of far-right accounts in the US</a>. Their peers at the Australian Broadcasting Corporation also used it to monitor <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/science/2020-08-24/how-the-qanon-conspiracy-theory-is-affecting-australian-families/12564566">QAnon's growing influence during the pandemic</a>, and to track <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-08-14/meta-shuts-crowdtangle-as-disinformation-ai-runs-rampant/104214782">disinformation fuelling the recent race riots</a> in the United Kingdom.</p>

<figure><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AFMHi0EJutQ?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0" width="650"></iframe></figure>

<h2>Why is Meta closing CrowdTangle?</h2>

<p>Given researchers and journalists used CrowdTangle to expose some of Meta's failings to the world, it's somewhat unsurprising the company would question why it was funding this largely free service. Keeping it operational, logic would dictate, would be bad for business.</p>

<p>But the reasons behind the closure of CrowdTangle are also more complicated.</p>

<p>One of the co-founders of the company, Brandon Silverman, told Wired the closure was <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/meta-kills-crucial-transparency-tool-worst-possible-time/">likely part of Meta's broader withdrawal</a> from the news business.</p>

<p>This withdrawal started in 2016 when the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/21/cambridge-analytica-facebook-data-users-profit">Cambridge Analytica scandal</a> revealed news was bad for Meta's core business: selling ads.</p>

<p>While news might generate strong engagement on Meta's platforms, it is the wrong kind of engagement for advertisers. X (formerly Twitter) also recently discovered this, when technology giant IBM pulled its advertising from the platform after <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-67446797">its ads were placed next to posts by Nazis</a>.</p>

<p>Meta's policies aimed at reducing exposure to news content across its platforms make explicit its withdrawal from the news business.</p>

<p>In February, <a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/continuing-our-approach-to-political-content-on-instagram-and-threads/">the company announced</a> it would stop “proactively recommending political content from accounts you don't follow” on Instagram. It also started <a href="https://transparency.meta.com/en-gb/features/approach-to-political-content/">de-ranking</a> political content on Facebook.</p>

<p>These announcements followed Meta's decision to pull out of Australia's News Media Bargaining Code and <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2024/02/update-on-facebook-news-us-australia/">stop paying for news content</a>.</p>

<p>However, while this redirection away from news may be commercially motivated, it is also about the particular news and information that spreads on Meta's products (for example, far-right influencers outperforming legacy news).</p>

<p>This brings Meta into the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/aug/25/how-the-eu-digital-services-act-affects-facebook-google-and-others">cross-hairs of international regulators</a> and threatens its ability to operate in key markets.</p>

<h2>An inferior new tool</h2>

<p>Meta has replaced CrowdTangle with its Content Library, <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2023/11/new-tools-to-support-independent-research/">which it claims</a> will “provide researchers access to more publicly-available content across Facebook and Instagram”. The new tool <a href="https://www.cjr.org/tow_center/meta-is-getting-rid-of-crowdtangle.php">will allow access to comments and short-form video</a>, which CrowdTangle did not.</p>

<p>But the new tool has major limitations.</p>

<p>Earlier this month the Coalition for Independent Technology Research published <a href="https://independenttechresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/CrowdTangle-Survey-Report-Final.pdf">results of a survey</a> with 400 independent researchers and 50 research organisations. They indicated Meta's Content Library has reduced functionality, including an inability to export data and use external tools to analyse it. It also has reduced access to posts from public figures without a large number of followers.</p>

<p>Combined, these factors will greatly hinder research.</p>

<p>But the biggest issue with Meta's new Content Library is that it won't be freely available to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/meta-to-replace-widely-used-data-tooland-largely-cut-off-reporter-access-43fc3f9d">journalists and newsrooms</a>.</p>

<p>The exact reasons for this are unclear. What is clear, however, are the implications of this reduced access.</p>

<p>Mozilla, a not-for-profit organisation dedicated to making the internet free and open for all, <a href="https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/campaigns/open-letter-to-meta-support-crowdtangle-through-2024-and-maintain-crowdtangle-approach/">said in an open letter to Meta</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Meta's decision will effectively prohibit the outside world, including election integrity experts, from seeing what's happening on Facebook and Instagram — during the biggest election year on record. This means almost all outside efforts to identify and prevent political disinformation, incitements to violence, and online harassment of women and minorities will be silenced.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There have been countless research reports, news articles, inquiries and lawsuits regarding misuse of Meta's platforms.</p>

<p>Yet it seems the only lesson the company has learned is to be selective about which data it makes transparent – and to whom.<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Algerian boxer Imane Khelif, who won the gold medal in boxing at the Paris Olympics, said that questions about her gender affected and hurt her a lot. From former US President Donald Trump and Tesla CEO Elon Musk to British author JK Rowling and scores of others on social media targeted Ms Khelif following her first-round bout against Italy's Angela Carini that lasted 46 seconds.</p>

<p>“This thing that affected me, I'm not lying to you, it affected me,” Ms Khelif said in an interview with El Birad in Algeria. A translated video of the interview was posted on X by journalist Salaiman Ahmed.</p>

<p>"It affected me a lot, it hurt me a lot. I can't describe to you the amount of fear I had," Ms Khelif said.</p>

<p>She wondered why there was an uproar from big politicians around the world. "I was afraid, but thank God, I managed to overcome this phase, thanks to the specialists who helped me overcome this stage," she added.</p>

<p>“The scenario was very scary. Thank God, all the people of Algeria and the Arab world knew Imane Ms Khelif with her femininity, her courage, her will,” Ms Khelif said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ms Khelif's reaction came after Donald Trump repeatedly referred to her as a man during a campaign rally in Montana on August 9.</p>

<p>“Who wants men to participate in women's sports? I would like to congratulate the young woman who transitioned from a man into a boxer. He... She won the gold medal," Trump said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Musk, who has thrown his weight behind Trump for the November 5 Presidential polls, also took potshots at the Algerian boxer by indirectly referring to her as a man in a series of social media posts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Imane Khelif along with Lin Yu-ting of Taiwan was&nbsp;subjected&nbsp;to trolling and intense criticism after it surfaced that the boxers were disqualified during the 2023 IBA World Boxing Championships for failing gender eligibility tests.</p>

<p>Ms Khelif, who defeated China's Yang Liu in the Paris Olympics 2024 for gold, has also filed a cyberbullying lawsuit naming Elon Musk and Harry Potter author J K Rowling over alleged "acts of aggravated cyber harassment", according to <a href="http://https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/jk-rowling-elon-musk-imane-khelif-lawsuit-1236105185/">Variety.</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The lawsuit has been filed against X in France.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pakistan has confirmed its first monkeypox case of the year after a man who recently returned from Saudi Arabia tested positive for the virus, ARY News reported citing the Ministry of Health.</p>

<p>The 34-year-old male resident of Mardan arrived in Pakistan on August 3 and developed symptoms shortly after arriving in Peshawar and reached out to the hospital for testing.</p>

<p>The diagnosis was confirmed by Khyber Medical University in Peshawar, as per ARY News.</p>

<p>His positive diagnosis was confirmed on August 13, marking the first reported case of monkeypox in Pakistan for 2024.</p>

<p>Health officials have begun contact tracing efforts to identify and monitor individuals who were in close contact with the patient, including fellow passengers on his flight from Saudi Arabia.</p>

<p>Earlier in 2023, three passengers were diagnosed with monkeypox at Karachi's Jinnah International Airport.</p>

<p>The Director General Health told the media that all three passengers were Pakistani citizens aged between 30 and 45. The passengers have been admitted to the infectious disease hospital.</p>

<p>Monkeypox remains a significant global health issue, with the World Health Organization (WHO) reporting 99,518 cases and 208 deaths across 122 countries.</p>

<p>According to ARY News, the virus, which spreads through close contact, presents with symptoms such as fever, rash, and body aches, typically lasting 2 to 4 weeks. Despite the spread, the WHO notes that 99 per cent of those infected survive.</p>

<p>In Pakistan, 11 cases have been reported since April 2023, with one resulting in death.</p>

<p>The National Institute of Health has issued an advisory outlining guidelines for managing and preventing the spread of monkeypox, urging continued vigilance and public health monitoring.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Syrian President Bashar al-Assad was on Sunday forced to flee the country after rebels seized the capital Damascus, ending his 24-year rule. As the news broke about the rebels entering Damascus, speculation grew about the whereabouts of the 59-year-old leader, who had for years taken help from his allies like Russia, Iran and Lebanon's Hezbollah to maintain his power.</p>

<p>Initially, there were reports that he had boarded a plane early on Sunday in Damascus for an unknown destination. The news agency Reuters reported that a Syrian airplane took off from Damascus airport around the time the capital was reported to have been taken by <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/syria-civil-war-all-about-the-rebels-behind-the-fall-of-bashar-al-assad-7205678#pfrom=home-ndtv_topscroll" target="_blank">rebels</a>.</p>

<p>The aircraft initially flew towards Syria's coastal region, a stronghold of Assad's Alawite sect and home to two key Russian military bases, but then made an abrupt U-turn and flew in the opposite direction for a few minutes before disappearing off the map.</p>

<p>Citing two Syrian sources, Reuters said the sudden change in course and disappearance of the plane from tracking could indicate it had been shot down, or that it had switched off its transponder. It was not clear who was on board.</p>

<p>However, after over 12 hours of speculation, it was reported that <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/bashar-al-assad-gone-to-russia-us-strikes-isis-camps-inside-syria-7204421#pfrom=home-ndtv_topscroll" target="_blank">Assad</a> is in Moscow with his family and that Russia has granted them asylum on humanitarian grounds.</p>

<p>"Breaking news! Bashar al-Assad and his family in Moscow. Russia does not betray friends in difficult situations," Mikhail Ulyanov, Russia's ambassador to international organisations in Vienna, said on his Telegram messaging channel.</p>

<p>Last week, Assad's allies Iran and Russia had also asked their citizens to leave Syria, citing the deteriorating security situation.</p>

<p>Bashar al-Assad's government fell 11 days after the Islamist Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) group challenged more than five decades of his family rule with a lightning offensive.</p>

<p>The rebels began their operation on November 27, the same day a ceasefire took place in neighbouring Lebanon between Israel and the Iran-backed Hezbollah members, and soon went on to seize key cities of Aleppo and Hama. They then took control of Damascus on Sunday to put an end to the Assad regime.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>South Korea's justice ministry said on Monday it had slapped a travel ban on President Yoon Suk Yeol as police probe him for insurrection over his ill-fated declaration of martial law.</p>

<p>At a parliamentary hearing, a lawmaker asked whether Yoon, who stands accused of leading an insurrection by declaring martial law Tuesday, had been banned from leaving the country. "Yes, that's right," Bae Sang-up, an immigration services commissioner at the Ministry of Justice said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>India said Monday it is monitoring the situation in Syria and called on all stakeholders to "work towards preserving the unity, sovereignty, and territorial integrity" of the West Asian country.</p>

<p>In a brief statement issued by the Ministry of External Affairs, the government said, "We advocate a peaceful and inclusive Syrian-led political process respecting the interests and aspirations of all sections of Syrian society." The embassy in Damascus, the Syrian capital, "is in contact with the Indian community, for their safety and security", the government also said.</p>

<p>The MEA's statement comes amid chaos in Syria following Islamist-led rebel factions' lightning advance into the capital over the past two weeks, which forced President Bashar al-Assad to flee the country Sunday; Russian news agencies have since claimed he is in Moscow.</p>

<p>The leader of the Islamist Hayat Tahrir al-Sham group claimed a "historic" victory Sunday in a speech from a landmark mosque in Damascus. "This victory, my brothers, is for the entire Islamic nation..." he said from the Umayyad Mosque in a video shared by the HTS on Telegram.</p>

<p>"Today, Syria is purified.... this victory is born from mujahideen (fighters) who languished in prison," Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, now using his real name Ahmed al-Sharaa, said.</p>

<p>HTS is rooted in the Syrian branch of Al-Qaeda, from which it ties in 2016. Labelled a 'terrorist organisation' by Western governments, HTS has sought to soften its image in recent years.</p>

<p>al-Assad's government fell over 13 years after a crackdown on anti-government protests ignited Syria's brutal civil war, which has involved foreign powers, jihadists and killed over 500,000.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A US-based drone company has captivated social media users after it posted a video of one of the largest drone shows by flying 5,000 UAVs over a field in Mansfield, Texas, ahead of Christmas. Sky Elements broke their own <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://skyelementsdrones.com/drone-light-show/5000-drone-show/" rel="noindex, nofollow">record </a>of flying 2,500 drones in the northern hemisphere, set just a week earlier and earned their 11th Guinness World Record. The company teamed up with UVify to bring the amazing drone light show to life which featured Santa Claus riding on his sleigh, pulled by two giant reindeer.</p>

<p>The video has since gone viral across social media, showing several technicians from both teams, setting up the drones in the outdoor setting. As the evening descends, the drones, with almost laser precision, take off the ground and fling themselves into the air with LED lights installed on them blinking to form gigantic structures. The very next moment, the Santa, clad in his red uniform and long beard can be seen waving at the audience with a sleigh filled with gifts for boys and girls on his nice list.</p>

<p>As of the last update, the video had gained over 98 million views and 5.5 million likes on Instagram alone.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Syrians woke up on Monday to an uncertain future after rebels seized the capital Damascus, forcing President Bashar al-Assad to flee to Russia, ending 13 years of civil war and five decades of iron-fisted Baath rule. The lightning advance of the opposition Islamist alliance, against President Asaad's forces, marked one of the biggest turning points for the Middle East in generations, wiping out a bastion from which Iran and Russia exercised influence across the Arab world.</p>

<p>The rebels who swept through Syria are spearheaded by Hayat al-Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), a former al-Qaeda affiliate, along with an umbrella group of Turkish-backed Syrian militias called the Syrian National Army. However, the uprising is deeply fractured, with a confusing mosaic of local groups espousing a range of Islamist and nationalist ideologies, including several Kurdish groups and Turkish-backed militias.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>A Look At Main Rebel Groups In Syria&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<h3><strong>Hayat Tahrir Al-Sham (HTS)</strong></h3>

<p>The most powerful group in Syria that spearheaded the rebels' advance is the Islamist group HTS. The group sprouted as the official al Qaeda affiliate in Syria under the name Nusra Front, staging attacks in Damascus from early in the uprising against Mr Assad.</p>

<p>However, its leader Ahmed al-Sharaa, who for years used the nom de guerre Abu Mohammed al-Golani, made a public exit first from the nascent Islamic State group, and then in 2016 from the global al Qaeda organisation. The group underwent several name changes, eventually rebranding as HTS, or Organization for the Liberation of the Levant, as it became the strongest group in the main rebel enclave around Idlib province in the northwest.</p>

<p>HTS and its leader have been designated terrorists by the United States, Turkey and others. There have been serious human rights concerns in the area it controls, including executions for those accused of affiliation with rival groups and over allegations of blasphemy and adultery. However, the group continued to fight alongside mainstream rebel groups and backed an administration in Idlib that they called the Salvation Government.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, &nbsp;Ahmed al-Sharaa presented a more moderate image during the lightning campaign that brought down Mr Assad, but some Syrians will probably remain fearful about his ultimate intentions.</p>

<h3><strong>Syrian National Army (SNA)</strong></h3>

<p>In 2016, Turkey sent troops into Syria to push Kurdish groups and Islamic State away from its borders. A key supporter of the rebels, it eventually formed some of the groups into the Syrian National Army which, backed by direct Turkish military power, held a stretch of territory along the Syrian-Turkish border.</p>

<p>As HTS and allied groups from the northwest advanced on Assad last week, the SNA also joined them, fighting government forces and Kurdish-led forces in the northeast.</p>

<h3><strong>Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF)</strong></h3>

<p>The Kurdish-led Peoples Protection Units (YPG) took control of large areas of northeast Syria in 2012 as government forces pulled out to fight rebels in the west. Turkey sees the YPG as inseparable from the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which has waged a decades-long insurgency inside Turkey, and which the US regards as a terrorist group.</p>

<p>As the Islamic State advanced in Syria in 2014, the YPG joined other groups to hold them back, supported by the US. They formed the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) alliance of Kurdish and Arab militias, backed by the US and its allies.</p>

<p>The SDF now controls most of the quarter of Syria that lies east of the Euphrates, including the former Islamic State capital of Raqqa and some of the country's biggest oil fields, as well as some territory to the west of the river.</p>

<h3><strong>Free Syrian Army (FSA)</strong></h3>

<p>FSA is a large coalition of decentralized Syrian opposition rebel groups founded in 2011 by Colonel Riad al-Asaad and six officers who defected from the Syrian Armed Forces. Initially established to represent a nationwide resistance and protect peaceful protesters against the Mr Assad regime, the FSA has struggled to live up to these goals. However, despite its subsequent decentralization, the FSA remains the cornerstone brand of Syria's moderate opposition.</p>

<h3><strong>Other Rebel Groups</strong></h3>

<p>Syria's uprising is fractured, with ideological coalitions, such as the Free Syrian Army and the Islamic Front, holding influence at different periods of the conflict. Over the years some of these splintered further or merged with other groups.</p>

<p>Their relative power was also shaped by whether they were based in regions captured by Assad or remained out of his hands.<br />
In northwestern Idlib, which until last week's stunning advance was the main rebel stronghold in Syria, a range of groups fought alongside HTS in a unified military operations command.</p>

<p>Other groups had dominated in the south. A string of Assad victories in 2018 forced them to accept his rule but without turning over all their arms or coming back under full Damascus control. Last week they rose up again, taking southwestern Syria.</p>

<h2><strong>What Is Happening In Syria?</strong></h2>

<p>After his ouster, Moscow gave asylum to Mr Assad and his family, Russian media reported and Mikhail Ulyanov, Russia's ambassador to international organizations in Vienna, said on his Telegram channel on Sunday.</p>

<p>International governments welcomed the end of the Mr Assads' autocratic government, as they sought to take stock of a new-look Middle East. US President Joe Biden said Syria is in a period of risk and uncertainty, and it is the first time in years that neither Russia, Iran nor the Hezbollah militant organization held an influential role there.</p>

<p>Japan's chief cabinet secretary, Yoshimasa Hayashi, said on Monday that Tokyo was paying close attention to developments in Syria.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the rebels face the monumental task of rebuilding and running a country after a war that left hundreds of thousands dead, cities pounded to dust and an economy hollowed by global sanctions. Syria will need billions of dollars in aid. "A new history, my brothers, is being written in the entire region after this great victory," said Ahmed al-Sharaa, better known as Abu Mohammed al-Golani, the head of HTS.</p>

<p>Speaking to a huge crowd on Sunday at Damascus' Umayyad Mosque, a place of enormous religious significance, Golani said with hard work Syria would be "a beacon for the Islamic nation."<br />

       <description><![CDATA[The experience aims to provide tourists with a taste of Japanese schools while boosting tourism in the region.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For a price as low as Rs 17,000 (30,000 yen), foreign tourists in Japan can experience the local school culture under a "one-day student" scheme, according to a report in the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scmp.com/news/people-culture/article/3289517/japan-offers-1-day-student-scheme-tourists-experience-local-school-culture-us200" rel="noindex, nofollow"><em>South China Morning Post</em></a> (SCMP). The company named Undokaiya has launched the unique programme under which foreign tourists can experience a day as a secondary student, with a plethora of activities ranging from calligraphy, katana fighting and physical education among others on offer. A decommissioned secondary school in Chiba Prefecture, eastern Japan has been converted for the novel experience.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It aims to provide tourists with a taste of Japanese schools while boosting tourism in the region. There is no age bar and anyone can come to immerse themselves in the experience. However, only 30 participants are allowed each day.</p>

<p>Notably, the Asian country's school culture is widely popular for its iconic sailor uniforms, vibrant club activities, and strong team spirit as depicted in various manga and anime shows. The visitors will be allowed to wear either the sailor uniform or suit for the opening ceremony. They are then assigned to their classrooms and practice calligraphy in Japanese language class.</p>

<p>Additionally, visitors can wear traditional kimonos, learn to use a katana and also participate in Japanese traditional dance. In between these activities, the school conducts disaster drills, teaching visitors essential emergency response skills like the children are taught. Since Japan is an earthquake-prone country, the visitors are taught about quickly ducking under their desks.</p>

<h3><strong>Japan's soft power</strong></h3>

<p>During the PE class, the "naughty students" with dyed hair and baseball hats, often depicted in the shows, may disrupt the proceedings and playfully intimidate the tourists, masquerading as students. The rebellious nature of students is part of Japan's Yanki culture -- a subculture that challenges school and social norms.</p>

<p>As the experience nears ends, the visitors are required to participate in classroom clean-up, an integral part of Japan's educational system that instils a sense of responsibility and develops civic sense among the children. After the culmination of all activities, the visitors receive a graduation certificate as a souvenir of the unique experience.</p>

<p>The entire programme is a direct result of Japan's growing soft power -- the manga and anime culture. The country's schools have invited the attention of fans who want to experience how it feels to immerse in the setting where most of their favourite characters develop and go on to have heroic arcs.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The rebels in Syria fought against the Bashar al-Assad regime for 13 years but failed to dislodge him from power. And then in a lightning offensive that lasted less than 13 days, the five-decade rule of the Assad family was decimated and the President was forced to flee the country. Behind the rebels' shocking advance was careful planning, the changing power balance in the Middle East, and tacit backing from a key regional player.</p>

<p><strong>The Timing</strong></p>

<p>The rebels knew that the Assad regime was at its most vulnerable. Over the past decade, the Syrian President had used the firepower of its key allies, Russia and Iran, to beat back any resistance to his regime. But Moscow was caught up with its war in Ukraine and Tehran was fighting Israel. With Assad's allies distracted, Damascus was fully exposed. Also, Hezbollah, which played a key role in Assad's fight against the rebels, suffered major losses after Tel Aviv wiped out its leader Hassan Nasrallah and several other commanders. With a ceasefire coming into force in Lebanon on November 27, Hezbollah licked its wounds and refused to fight Assad's war with rebels. Syria was also battling internal issues. A source told news agency Reuters that tanks and planes had no fuel due to large-scale corruption and loot. Celebrating the fall of the Assad regime, some Syria residents said many Syrians had fled to Lebanon because they did not want to fight their countrymen. The Syrian forces were, therefore, unequipped, low on morale and bereft of allies. The rebels knew this was their chance and they took it.</p>

<p><strong>Turkey's Role</strong></p>

<p>As the Assad regime collapsed, Turkey's deputy minister for foreign affairs, Nuh Yilmaz, said at a conference in Bahrain that Ankara was not behind the offensive and did not provide consent. He said it was concerned about instability.</p>

<p>But there is no way the rebels would have moved ahead with a signal from Turkey. About six months ago, the rebels communicated to Ankara their plans for a major offensive and felt they had received its tacit approval, two sources have told Reuters. Turkey has long backed the Syrian opposition, although it considers the main force in the rebel alliance, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), a terror group.</p>

<p>The all-out offensive, it is learnt, was the brainchild of HTS and its leader Abu Mohammed al-Golani. HTS started as Nusra Front with links with al-Qaeda. Golani is designated a terrorist in several countries, including the US, UK and Turkey. Over the past decade, however, he and his organisation have tried to soften its image.</p>

<p>Turkey's foreign and defence ministries have not responded directly to Reuters questions about whether there was an understanding between HTS and Ankara about the Aleppo operation. A Turkish official told Reuters that HTS "does not receive orders or direction from us (and) does not coordinate its operations with us either." The official said that "in that sense" it would not be correct to say that the operation in Aleppo was carried out with Turkey's approval.</p>

<p><strong>Ankara's Interests</strong></p>

<p>The war in Syria has driven a wave of refugees into Turkey and this has become a domestic issue too. For long, it has urged the Bashar al-Assad regime, once a close ally, for a political solution to the problem but got little response. Damascus saw this as a weakness and insisted on the complete withdrawal of Turkish forces from Syria. This was not an option for Ankara because it feared this would lead to a further influx of refugees. And then Moscow pulled the last straw. Alexander Lavrentiev, Russia's special envoy to Syria, called Turkey an "occupying force" in Syria and said it was "too soon" for talks between Ankara and Damascus.</p>

<p>The rebels sensed that the Recep Tayyip Erdogan dispensation was not happy with Damascus rebuffing its outreach. A Syrian opposition source told Reuters that the rebels had shown Turkey details of the planning after Ankara's attempts to engage Assad failed. The message was: "That other path hasn't worked for years - so try ours. You don't have to do anything, just don't intervene."</p>

<p>As Damascus sees a regime change, Turkey has reason to be relieved. Its tacit support to the rebels may pave the way for peace on the border and also help it eliminate the resistance from groups such as the YPG that it has fought for years.</p>

<p>Turkey now hopes that peace in Syria will create an atmosphere conducive to the return of refugees. There is, however, a risk: if the overthrow of the Bashar al-Assad regime starts another phase of instability, Ankara may be dealing with another refugee crisis.</p>

<p><strong>Israel Another Winner</strong></p>

<p>Another winner in the fall of the Bashar al Assad regime is Israel. The regime change in Damascus has blocked the route through which Iran provided arms to Hezbollah in Lebanon. Tel Aviv can now effectively wipe out an already-weakened Hezbollah. Moving fast after the rebels took Damascus, Israeli Air Force fighter jets struck dozens of targets across Syria, taking out weaponry that it feared could fall into the hands of the rebels, the Times of Israel reported. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has welcomed the change in Syria, calling it a historic day. He also said its offensive against Hezbollah was instrumental in the regime change in Syria.</p>

<p>"This collapse is a direct result of our forceful action against Hezbollah and Iran, Assad's main supporters. It set off a chain reaction of all those who want to free themselves from this tyranny and its suppression. But it also means we have to take action against possible threats. One of them is the collapse of the Separation of Forces agreement from 1974 between Israel and Syria. This agreement held for 50 years. Last night it collapsed," he said.</p>

<p>Israel has now taken charge of a demilitarised buffer zone on its border with Syria. "This is a temporary defensive position until a suitable arrangement is found. We're going to follow events very carefully. If we can establish neighbourly relations and peaceful relations with the new forces emerging in Syria, that's our desire. But if we do not, we'll do whatever it takes to defend the State of Israel and the border of Israel," Netanyahu said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>More cases of a mysterious flu-like illness labeled "Disease X" were reported in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and the World Health Organization has dispatched a rapid response team to help investigate.</p>

<p>Since October 24, 406 cases of the unidentified illness - marked by fever, headache, cough, runny nose, and body aches - have been reported through December 5 in the Panzi health zone in Congo's southwest, the WHO said Sunday in a statement. That's up from 376 cases announced last week. While more than half of the cases involve children under 5, a 50-year-old male traveler hospitalized in Lucca, Italy, is suspected to have recovered from the disease, Il Tempo reported.</p>

<p>Thirty-one deaths have been recorded, down from 79 reported last week, according to the WHO. The outbreak is centered in a remote rural area of Kwango province, where poor road conditions and heavy rains mean it takes nearly 48 hours to reach from Kinshasa. The challenges of accessing the region have hampered efforts to confirm fatalities linked to the illness. All severe cases involve individuals suffering from severe malnutrition, adding complexity to identifying an infectious source.</p>

<p>"These challenges, coupled with limited diagnostics in the region, have delayed the identification of the underlying cause," the WHO said. "Teams are collecting samples for laboratory testing, providing a more detailed clinical characterization of the detected cases, investigating the transmission dynamics, and actively searching for additional cases, both within health facilities and at the community level."</p>

<p>Acute pneumonia, influenza, Covid-19, measles and malaria are considered as potential causal factors based on the signs and symptoms of those afflicted, the WHO said, adding that response teams are helping to treat patients and raise awareness of the outbreak within affected communities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Malaria is common in the area, and it may be causing or contributing to the cases, the United Nations health agency said. "Laboratory tests are underway to determine the exact cause. At this stage, it is also possible that more than one disease is contributing to the cases and deaths."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Survivors of the US atomic bombings of Japan will receive the Nobel Peace Prize on Tuesday but, after years of anti-nuclear campaigning and showing the world their scars, they still retain the painful memories of the discrimination they have faced.</p>

<p>After the 1945 US bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki led to Japan's surrender and the end of World War II, many people who survived the attacks were shunned by society.</p>

<p>Prejudice related to their exposure to radiation made it hard for them to find jobs and affected their prospects for marriage, leading one small group in Tokyo to build a communal grave where dozens were buried together.</p>

<p>There are currently around 106,800 A-bomb survivors, known as "hibakusha", in Japan, according to the government. Their average age is 85.</p>

<p>One of them is 90-year-old Reiko Yamada, who was 11 and lived in Hiroshima when the United States dropped the first atomic bomb on August 6, 1945, killing around 140,000 people.</p>

<p>That attack, and another three days later in Nagasaki where 74,000 people were killed, inflicted severe injuries and radiation-related illnesses on those who survived.</p>

<p>"People faced extreme discrimination" over their scars and exposure to radiation, Yamada told AFP.</p>

<p>"In the past, people told hibakusha, 'Don't get married' or 'Don't come close. You are infectious'," she said.</p>

<p>"Some people lost their whole family in Hiroshima or Nagasaki, and even though they stayed with relatives, they were stripped of what they used to own and were bullied."</p>

<p>Yamada, who lives in Tokyo, has assisted fellow hibakusha for nearly six decades, travelling worldwide to share her experiences.</p>

<p>"When I visited the homes of hibakusha, some of them would whisper to me: 'You are a hibakusha, right? I don't say anything about it to my children,'" she said.</p>

<h3><strong>Shared grave</strong></h3>

<p>The Peace Prize was won by Nihon Hidankyo, a large grassroots group of A-bomb survivors who campaign for their members' rights and a world free of nuclear weapons.</p>

<p>But the prize came too late for many early campaigners who had spoken out about their trauma and physical wounds, hoping to prevent others from suffering as they had.</p>

<p>Terumi Tanaka, Nihon Hidankyo's 92-year-old co-chair, told reporters recently that it was "sad and frustrating" that "so many people who stood next to me, people who led the movement" were not there to share the honour of the Nobel.</p>

<p>After World War II, young people including hibakusha were drawn to big cities such as Tokyo for work and education.</p>

<p>Many survivors chose to live in relative isolation, finding that Tokyo's dense population allowed them to "hide", said Michiko Murata, 73, who helps run Toyukai, an association of hibakusha in the capital.</p>

<p>"Many people struggled a lot," Murata said, often deciding not to have children because of worries over the effects of radiation.</p>

<p>Some members of Toyukai built a shared grave in western Tokyo in 2005 and Murata helps maintain it.</p>

<p>But as they get older, holding an annual mourning ceremony there has become too difficult and will end next year.</p>

<p>The remains of around 60 people are buried under the large, rocky gravestone.</p>

<p>"We inscribe here with our lives: Never tolerate nuclear bombs," a stone plaque next to the tomb says.</p>

<p>Many remembered there were hibakusha without relatives to give them a proper funeral.</p>

<p>"They lived alone. So after they died, they wanted to be with others, in a place where they can talk about Hiroshima and Nagasaki without fears of discrimination," Murata said.</p>

<h3><strong>Blinding light</strong></h3>

<p>Although Yamada did not experience direct discrimination, her family always kept quiet about what they lived through.</p>

<p>"My family never talked about it, even among ourselves," she said.</p>

<p>On the bright August morning when the bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, she was sitting under the shade of a tree in her school's playground when she saw a gleaming B-29 bomber high in the clear sky.</p>

<p>Then blinding white light flashed. Hot sandy gusts blew her onto the ground.</p>

<p>Clouds gathered. The sky darkened. Black rain containing radioactive material began to shower over her and she suddenly felt cold.</p>

<p>"I didn't know what was happening," said Yamada, whose school was located far enough from ground zero to avoid total destruction.</p>

<p>Thousands of bloody and charred survivors soon filled the area, many of them evacuees from the city centre who died on the streets and lay there until the bodies were cleared.</p>

<p>Yamada later learned that around 2,300 bodies were burned on her school's grounds.</p>

<p>"There was no record of their names. They became 'missing individuals'," she said.</p>

<p>Now, as wars rage worldwide, Yamada said the Nobel has validated the survivors' work.</p>

<p>"I hope to pass on our dream to those who can inherit this, and continue," she said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Women are increasingly being hired for the roles at companies that tend to lead to the CEO slot, but they're still largely missing at the highest rungs of British corporations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Women now make up 23% of chief financial officers, chief operating officers, divisional bosses or are already chief executives across the FTSE 100, according to new research by 25x25, an organization formed to help boost the level of female talent at the top of British companies. That's up from 16% in 2021, the group said.</p>

<p>The increase is important, the organization found, because 90% of the CEOs of the country's biggest companies came up through one of those roles. Still, just two out of 17 CEO appointments in the FTSE 100 between June 2023 and June 2024 were women.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The research shows just how much of an uphill battle female executives have. Even today, just nine of the FTSE 100 bosses are women, down from a peak of 11 the index reached earlier this year.</p>

<p>"The pathways to CEO are unbelievably narrow," said Tara Cemlyn-Jones, a former investment banker who now leads 25x25. "The great majority have developed their skills and experience in narrow silos."</p>

<p>Cemlyn-Jones - whose organization includes public and private companies from different sectors, including NatWest Group Plc, BP Plc, Unilever Plc and BAE Systems Plc - encouraged corporations to take a more flexible approach to candidates' experience, which she believes would allow more women reach the top.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To be sure, the UK isn't alone. Separate research from Bloomberg Intelligence has found that globally, only 6% of CEOs are women, with the level ranging from 3% in emerging markets to 8% in the US and Europe.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Women have made scant progress in the C-Suite," said Adeline Diab, director of research and chief ESG strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence. "Three in four companies still have no women in C-Suite positions."</p>

<p>35% of leadership positions are held by women, according to this year's FTSE Women Leaders Review of the top 350 companies across the UK - though that figure "masks the truth," said Pavita Cooper, UK chair of the 30% Club, which campaigns for more women on boards. Not enough of those women are in charge of significant parts of the business which would put them on a route to the CEO role, she said.</p>

<p>Part of the problem is that some stakeholders - such as board members and head hunters - are an "inadvertent drag" on more women reaching the CEO rank and are instead prompting boards to appoint people who are similar to the incumbent executive holding the role, Cemlyn-Jones said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I think boards in the UK are becoming more and more risk averse," Chris O'Shea, CEO of the 6.6 billion pounds energy company Centrica, said in the research. "And some of that's being driven by some of the governance rules that we've got."&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What Bloomberg Intelligence Says:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Women have made scant progress in the C-Suite but momentum may be picking up, with recent appointments including CEOs at S&amp;P and HKEX and CFOs at HSBC and Ford. Though qualified candidates exist, more effort is needed to help them break the glass ceiling.</p>

<p>- Adeline Diab, Bloomberg Intelligence.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Recruiters also play a large part in who is picked to lead UK companies because half of all FTSE 100 companies select external candidates for the top job, compared to a fifth of large companies in the US.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This puts women at a direct disadvantage, according to the 25x25 research, because headhunters' fees tend to be linked to the incoming CEO's salary. That could inadvertently incentivize them to prioritize men, who typically command higher salaries, the research found.</p>

<p>The UK's tendency to recruit more CEOs externally is particularly problematic for female candidates, and suggests boards don't trust their own internal succession planning, 25x25 found. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Efforts to improve diversity of C-Suites and boardrooms globally could soon face headwinds as incoming US President Donald Trump prepares to return to the White House in January. He has vowed to dismantle diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives as part of his promise to end "wokeness" in America.</p>

<p>Still, companies led by boards with a greater female presence have delivered 2% to 5% higher returns in developed markets, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. Statistics like that could help keep these diversity initiatives front-of-mind for companies, the research shows.</p>

<p>"The financial performance linked to diversity reveals the benefits and may represent a strong counter-argument to any anti-woke rhetoric," Diab said. &nbsp;</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p dir="ltr">This Christmas wish comes nearly nine months after Buckingham Palace announced that King Charles III had been diagnosed with cancer during a “routine hospital procedure for benign prostate enlargement.” Following the announcement, the monarch briefly stepped back from public engagements to undergo treatment. At the time, Buckingham Palace stated that the King remained optimistic about his treatment and was eager to return to his royal duties as soon as he was able to do so.</p>

<p dir="ltr">By April 2024, King Charles was able to resume his royal commitments, beginning with a visit to a cancer treatment centre to meet with patients and medical staff. In June 2024, the King and Queen hosted a State Visit for the Emperor and Empress of Japan, marking an important diplomatic event.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Buckingham Palace also expressed gratitude in a statement, saying, “Their Majesties remain deeply grateful for the many kindnesses and good wishes they have received from around the world throughout the joys and challenges of the past year.”</p>

<p dir="ltr">Charles' health battle was also part of a difficult year for the royal family, which included Kate Middleton's cancer diagnosis. Following her abdominal surgery in January 2024, the Princess of Wales, 42, revealed her diagnosis in March. Kate took time away from public events for treatment but gradually resumed her duties, making a public appearance at the Trooping the Colour parade in June 2024. By September, she announced that her chemotherapy was complete and she had finished her treatment.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Charles and Camilla took the monarchy in May 2023 after his mother, Queen Elizabeth II, died in September 2022.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At least 110 people were killed over the weekend in Haiti's Cite Soleil slum when a gang leader targeted elderly people he suspected of causing his child's illness through witchcraft, the National Human Right Defense Network said on Sunday.</p>

<p>The gang leader, known as Monel "Mikano" Felix, along with his Viv Ansanm group, were responsible of the massacre.</p>

<p>RNDDH said that after Felix's child became sick, he sought advice from a voudou priest who accused elderly people in the area of harming the child through witchcraft, triggering Felix to order the massacre.</p>

<p>Gang members killed at least 60 people on Friday and 50 on Saturday using machetes and knives, all of them aged over 60, it said.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In an unlikely turn of events, a British author has rapidly climbed the bestseller charts after a simple post on social media about her selling two books at a local event went viral. Vicky Ball, 48, from Colchester, went to an authors' event at Galleywood Heritage Centre in Chelmsford last week to showcase her two novels, one titled Powerless and the other Abandoned. Though Ms Ball only managed to sell two copies, she took to X (formerly Twitter) to express gratitude about being able to write books and sell them to people.</p>

<p>"Sold 2 books," Ms Ball wrote on X afterwards, which she described as positive because: "I've done some events where I haven't sold any."</p>

<p></p>

<p>The post soon went viral as social media users showed the endearing side of the internet. As of the last update, the post had garnered nearly 25 million views and more than 745,000 likes which catapulted Ms Ball to the top of Amazon's bestseller charts, as people from across the globe started ordering her books.</p>

<p>"Feel like I'm in some kind of weird crazy dream right now where lots of people have bought my books," she posted, whilst also sharing a screenshot of Abandoned being no.1 on the American charts.</p>

<h3><strong>'It's unbelievable'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>While Powerless is a thriller, replete with a plethora of twists about a missing girl who returns home, Abandons mainly deals with an alcoholic mother with a dark secret.</p>

<p>"I've been getting messages on Instagram of people saying: 'I'm in Colombia and just bought your book'; 'I'm in Salt Lake City'; 'I'm in Belgium.' It's amazing really - it's just unbelievable," Ms Ball told the Guardian.</p>

<p>Ms Ball currently works at the University of Essex and is currently pursuing a master's degree in creative writing. She wrote Powerless during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, mostly on weekends as she was teaching.</p>

<p>Quizzed about advice to aspiring authors who also wanted to write something, MS ball shared a simple suggestion.</p>

<p>“Just write! I just go with it. It's like a journey, and I really enjoy the process.You never know where it's going to go.”</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Australia is launching a federal police taskforce targeting anti-Semitism, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said on Monday, days after an arson attack on a Melbourne synagogue.</p>

<p>"Anti-Semitism is a major threat and anti-Semitism has been on the rise," Albanese said, citing the synagogue blaze and recent vandalism.</p>

<p>The taskforce will be made up of federal police to be deployed across the country as needed, officials said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>They will focus on threats, violence and hatred towards the Jewish community and parliamentarians.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There is no information to suggest further attacks are likely and Australia's terror threat assessment will remain at its current level of "probable", said Mike Burgess, director-general of the Australian Security and Intelligence Organisation.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri arrives in Dhaka on Monday morning to discuss bilateral relations between India and Bangladesh, officials said. This is the first high-level official visit after the interim government led by Muhammad Yunus took over in Bangladesh.</p>

<p>The visit comes amid recent reports of rise in violence against minorities in Bangladesh and the arrest of spiritual leader Chinmoy Krishna Das in Chittagong.</p>

<p>The delegation led by the foreign secretaries of the two countries is expected to discuss the overall issues of bilateral relations by participating in the Foreign Office Consultation (FOC) mechanism established between the two countries.</p>

<p>On December 4, Press Secretary to the Chief Advisor of Bangladesh's interim government, Shafiqul Alam, said that the Foreign Secretaries of the two countries would hold talks on issues of mutual interest.</p>

<p>In September this year, the Foreign Adviser (Minister) of the interim government of Bangladesh Md. Touhid Hossain had met the Indian External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) in New York. They decided to maintain "good working relationship" and also decided to hold FOC between India and Bangladesh.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, reports of attacks on minorties continue in Bangladesh. On December 6, another Hindu temple was allegedly set on fire in the outskirts of Dhaka. The Mahabhagya Lakshminarayan Mandir, at Dhor village, in North of Dhaka came under attack on late Friday night.</p>

<p>Babul Ghosh, supervisor of the temple said that a complaint has been filed against unidentified miscreants for burning down his ancestral temple.</p>

<p>Speaking with ANI, Mr Ghosh said that the attackers poured petrol on the idols while he was not present at the house and ran away on hearing his footsteps.He further alleged that the attackers had some "ulterior motives" other than burning the idols.</p>

<p>Spiritual leader Chinmony Krishna Das also continues to be under arrest on alleged sedition charges. The Ministry of External Affairs has pressed the Bangladesh interim government to ensure that the legal rights of the individual are respected and that his trial is fair and transparent.</p>

<p>Chinmoy Krishna Das, who is associated with the Sammilita Sanatani Jagaran Jote, was arrested in Dhaka on November 25 on 'sedition' charges. The arrest followed a complaint file on October 31 by a local politician that accused Chinmoy Das and others of disrespecting Bangladesh's national flag during a rally of the Hindu community. On December 3, a Bangladesh court set January 2, 2025 as the next date of hearing in the case.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">A woman who initially accused Sean "Diddy" Combs of sexual assault has expanded her lawsuit to include allegations against rapper Jay-Z. The complainant, identified as Jane Doe, claims she was 13 years old when the alleged assaults occurred during an afterparty following the 2000 Video Music Awards.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The lawsuit, initially filed in October, was amended on Sunday to name Jay-Z as a defendant in the ongoing civil case, CNN reported. According to the woman, she consumed a drink at the party that left her feeling disoriented and she wandered into a bedroom. There, she alleges Jay-Z assaulted her first, followed by Diddy. She claims she struck Diddy and fled the scene.</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" height="281" mozallowfullscreen="true" scrolling="no" src="https://www.ndtv.com/videos/embed-player/?id=870863&amp;mute=1&amp;autostart=1&amp;mutestart=true&amp;pWidth=100&amp;pHeight=100" webkitallowfullscreen="true" width="500"></iframe></p>

<p dir="ltr">The allegations make Jay-Z the first celebrity to be accused in connection with Diddy, who is already facing numerous charges, including sex trafficking, racketeering conspiracy, and prostitution-related offenses. Sean "Diddy" Combs has pleaded not guilty and denies any wrongdoing in over 30 civil lawsuits filed against him.</p>

<p dir="ltr">In a statement to <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/08/entertainment/jay-z-accused-13-year-old-sean-diddy-combs/index.html " rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">CNN</a>, Jay-Z vehemently denied the allegations, calling them "heinous" and urging the complainant to pursue criminal charges if the claims are true. "Whoever would commit such a crime against a minor should be locked away, would you not agree?” Jay-Z said. He also labelled the lawsuit as a "blackmail attempt" and accused her attorney, Tony Buzbee, of engaging in "theatrics" to extort money.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Jay-Z expressed concern for his family, particularly his children, as they face public scrutiny over the claims. "My wife and I will have to…..explain the cruelty and greed of people to our children. I mourn yet another loss of innocence," he added.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Mr Buzbee, a Houston-based attorney, dismissed the musician's accusations of extortion. In a statement, he said the case was serious and vowed to litigate it in court. “This is a very serious matter. The pleading speaks for itself,” he said.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Mr Buzbee also defended the amended lawsuit against Jay-Z, claiming the complainant was compelled to act after facing alleged intimidation. The rapper orchestrated “a conspiracy of harassment, bullying, and intimidation against Plaintiff's lawyers to silence her,” the lawsuit says.</p>

<p dir="ltr">In response to his comments, Mr Buzbee reiterated <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DChs_cDJOoo/?hl=en " rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">on Instagram</a> that the complainant never sought monetary compensation, only a confidential mediation. "She is emboldened. I'm very proud of her resolve," Mr Buzbee wrote.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>New York authorities have released new photographs of the suspect accused of shooting and killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in Midtown Manhattan. The images were released by the New York Police Department (NYPD). In the first picture, a masked individual is sitting inside a taxi shortly after the incident. In the next frame, the suspect is walking on a street wearing a hooded top and a black down jacket.</p>

<p>One of the photographs shows the suspect gazing directly at a camera, seemingly communicating with the taxi driver through a partition window. While officials confirmed the suspect took a taxi near Central Park after the homicide outside the Hilton Hotel, they have not verified if the images are from that specific ride.</p>

<p>The NYPD is actively seeking public assistance in locating the suspect. Authorities have urged anyone with information to reach out through the NYPD helpline or send direct messages on X (formerly Twitter) or Instagram.</p>

<p dir="ltr">According to <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/08/us/brian-thompson-unitedhealthcare-gunman-search-sunday/index.html" rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">CNN</a>, the NYPD, collaborating with the FBI and other law enforcement agencies, is intensifying its search for the suspect. Authorities believe the individual has left New York City but remain confident of his eventual capture.</p>

<p>"We had to go through lots of video evidence to get that one money shot with the mask down," police Commissioner Jessica Tisch was quoted as saying.</p>

<p>The FBI is offering a $50,000 reward for information leading to the suspect's arrest and conviction, with an additional $10,000 from the NYPD. Photographs of the suspect have been distributed widely to law enforcement agencies, airports, and border patrol stations along the US-Mexico and US-Canada borders to prevent his escape from the country.</p>

<p>Key evidence gathered so far includes images of the suspect's unmasked face, video footage tracing his escape route, a Peak Design backpack containing Monopoly money and a Tommy Hilfiger jacket, DNA from a discarded Starbucks water bottle, a partial fingerprint from the same bottle and 9 mm shell casings inscribed with the words "delay," "deny," and "depose," stated the CNN report.</p>

<p>But crucial items, including the murder weapon and the suspect's getaway bicycle, remain missing. Police divers recently concluded an extensive search of a Central Park lake, the iconic boathouse and Bethesda Fountain without locating the firearm.</p>

<p>Brian Thompson, 50, was gunned down on December 4 as he approached the New York Hilton Midtown on West 54th Street to attend his company's annual investor conference. Commissioner Tisch said the killer was "lying in wait" outside the hotel. Thompson was shot at least once in the back and once in the right calf and was later declared dead at a hospital.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The month marked another milestone in global warming, recording a temperature 1.62 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.</p>

<p>It also became the 16th month in the past 17 months where global temperatures exceeded the critical 1.5 degrees Celsius threshold above pre-industrial levels, the agency said.</p>

<p>According to the India Meteorological Department, India experienced the second warmest November since 1901, with the average maximum temperature clocking 29.37 degrees Celsius -- 0.62 degree above normal.</p>

<p>For the year so far (January to November), the global average temperature anomaly stands at 0.72 degrees Celsius above the 1991-2020 average, making it the highest on record for this period and 0.14 degrees Celsius warmer than the corresponding period in 2023.</p>

<p>The European climate agency said it is almost certain that 2024 will be the warmest year on record, with the annual temperature exceeding 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. 2023, the hottest year on record so far, was 1.48 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.</p>

<p>Average sea surface temperatures (SSTs) for November 2024 were also the second-highest on record for the month, at 20.58 degrees Celsius, just 0.13 degrees Celsius below the November 2023 record.</p>

<p>While the equatorial eastern and central Pacific moved towards neutral or La Nina conditions, sea surface temperatures remained unusually high across many ocean regions, Copernicus said.</p>

<p>Samantha Burgess, Deputy Director of the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), said: "With Copernicus data in from the penultimate month of the year, we can now confirm with virtual certainty that 2024 will be the warmest year on record and the first calendar year above 1.5 degrees Celsius. This does not mean the Paris Agreement has been breached, but it underscores the urgent need for ambitious climate action.” The Paris Agreement, adopted in 2015, aims to limit global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. A permanent breach of the 1.5-degree Celsius limit refers to long-term warming over a 20 or 30-year period. Earth's global surface temperature has already increased by around 1.3 degrees Celsius compared to the average in 1850-1900 due to the rapidly increasing concentration of greenhouse gases -- primarily carbon dioxide and methane -- in the atmosphere.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>South Korea's opposition on Monday accused the ruling party of staging a "second coup" by clinging to power and refusing to impeach President Yoon Suk Yeol over his declaration of martial law.</p>

<p>Yoon plunged the country into political chaos with his attempt to scrap civilian rule, which lasted just six hours after lawmakers scuffled with soldiers in the parliament building and managed to vote the measure down, forcing Yoon into an embarrassing U-turn.</p>

<p>The president and a slew of top officials are now being investigated for insurrection, but a bid to impeach Yoon failed Saturday after a boycott by the ruling party, who claim the wildly unpopular leader has agreed to hand power to the prime minister and party chief.</p>

<p>"This is an unlawful, unconstitutional act of a second insurrection and a second coup," Democratic Party floor leader Park Chan-dae said, urging the ruling party to "stop it immediately".</p>

<p>Under South Korea's constitution, the president remains head of government and commander in chief of the army unless he or she is incapacitated, resigns or steps down.</p>

<p>In such a case, power would be handed to the prime minister on an interim basis, until elections could be held.</p>

<p>Claiming that Yoon can remain in office but has delegated his powers to the prime minister and leader of his ruling People Power Party -- who is not an elected official -- is "a blatant constitutional violation with no legal basis," Park said.</p>

<p>"Their attitude of placing themselves above the Constitution mirrors that of insurrectionist Yoon Suk Yeol," he added.</p>

<p>Investigators have already detained the former defence minister, raided his offices, slapped a host of top officials with travel bans, and on Monday called in the general who was made martial law commander for further questioning.</p>

<p>Yoon himself could be called in for questioning, police said Monday, adding that they are "considering" whether to ban him from traveling, as their investigation gathered speed.</p>

<p>"There are no human or physical restrictions to the subject of an investigation," said Woo Jong-soo, head of the National Investigation Headquarters of the National Police Agency.</p>

<p>Police will investigate "in accordance with the law and principles -- without any exceptions".</p>

<h3><strong>Power vacuum?</strong></h3>

<p>The defence ministry confirmed Monday that the embattled Yoon remained at the head of the country's security apparatus, despite the apparent power vacuum in the country -- which remains technically at war with the nuclear-armed North.</p>

<p>"Legally, (control of military forces) currently lies with the commander in chief," defense ministry spokesperson Jeon Ha-kyou said.</p>

<p>Yoon, 63, has apologised for "anxiety and inconvenience" caused by his declaration of martial law but has not stepped down, saying instead he would entrust decisions about his fate to his party -- and accept all political and legal responsibility for the martial law fiasco.</p>

<p>There is no constitutional basis supporting the ruling party's claim that Yoon can stay in office but hand over his power to unelected party officials, said Kim Hae-won, a constitutional law professor at Pusan National University Law School.</p>

<p>"It seems to resemble an unconstitutional soft coup," he told AFP.</p>

<p>"If there are issues with the President, there are ways laid out in the Constitution such as suspending the president from his duties, and then move on to proceedings set out in the Constitution, such as impeachment," he said.</p>

<p>The opposition has already said they will try again to impeach the president, with leader Lee Jae-myung saying another vote would be held on Saturday.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Huge crowds are expected to gather again outside the National Assembly building.</p>

<p>Yoon's approval rating hit 11 percent, a historic low for the unpopular president, according to a new Gallup poll commissioned by local media.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

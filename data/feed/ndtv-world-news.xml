       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President-elect Donald Trump has appointed immigration hardliner and close aide, Stephen Miller, as his White House deputy chief of staff for policy. Confirming Millar's appointment, Vice President-elect JD Vance on Monday, congratulated the incoming deputy chief of staff for policy on X, calling him "another fantastic pick by the president."</p>

<p>Mr Miller was part of the president-elect's first administration and served as his senior adviser and director of speech-writing at the White House. He was also a central figure behind several of Mr Trump's policies on immigration, including the Muslim travel ban and the 2018 family separation policy.</p>

<h2><strong>Miller's Stance On H-1B Visas</strong></h2>

<p>Known for his extremist rhetoric, Mr Miller was a frequent presence during the president-elect's 2024 campaign, often seen speaking at Mr Trump's rallies. Addressing Mr Trump's infamous Madison Square Garden rally in New York which saw an attendance of nearly 19,500 Americans, Mr Miller told the crowd that "America is for Americans and Americans only" and promised to "restore America to the true Americans".</p>

<p>Last year during an interview with the New York Times, Mr Miller asserted that if Mt Trump was re-elected, his administration would bring policies to restrict legal and illegal immigration. He also talked about plans to detain undocumented immigrants in camps while they await expulsion.</p>

<p>During Trump's first administration, Miller helped in drafting the Cruz-Sessions bill that prohibited international students with a master's or bachelor's degree from working in H-1B status in the US for at least 10 years.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now in his new role in Trump 2.0, Mr Miller is expected to continue his advocacy for restrictive immigration policies, including limits on H-1B visas. He argues that the H-1B program can lead to American worker displacement and wage suppression.</p>

<h3><strong>Trump Administration And Immigration&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Trump administration's stance on immigration has often been at odds with economic consensus, which shows that skilled immigrants and international students benefit the US economy. As president, Mr Trump did not enact any measures to increase access to H-1B visas, and his second term will likely be similar. Policies introduced during his presidency also saw a rise in visa denial rates and a narrowing of the definition of "speciality occupation," reducing the positions eligible for H-1B workers.</p>

<p>In 2020, before Mr Trump left office, his administration published a restrictive H-1B rule, which was blocked by a court for violating the Administrative Procedure Act. As per a report by Forbes, the rule included numerous provisions to prevent companies from employing foreign-born scientists and engineers, such as changing who and what positions could qualify for an H-1B speciality occupation.</p>

<p>Taking his previous administration's agenda forward, Mr Trump has also appointed former acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) director Tom Homan as his administration's "Border Czar." In a post on his Truth Social platform, the President-elect said that Homan would oversee the border security of the US along with maritime and aviation security. He also stated that Mr Homan would oversee deportation policies.</p>

<p>Together, Miller and Homan are anticipated to work closely in implementing the Trump administration's restrictive immigration measures.</p>

<p>The <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/stuartanderson/2024/11/10/past-h-1b-visa-policies-predict-donald-trumps-immigration-policy/" rel="No Follow, No Index" target="_blank">Forbes</a> report said that if President Joe Biden's administration does not finalize the H-1B "modernizing" rule before he leaves the Oval Office, a new Trump administration could issue the H-1B rule with its priorities rather than those of the Biden team.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As per the report, the new rule would likely be far more restrictive than the current H-1B regulation or what US Citizenship and Immigration Services proposed in October 2023.&nbsp;<br />

       <description><![CDATA[The model has been pre-trained on more than 11,000 surgical specimens and over 4 million unique microscopic fields of view]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Researchers have developed a tool that uses artificial intelligence to mark any part of the cancerous brain tumour that remains behind after surgery, within 10 seconds, according to a report in Science Daily.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The breakthrough technology, named FastGlioma, was introduced in a research paper titled "Foundation models for fast, label-free detection of glioma infiltration" in Nature Journal, and claims to beat the traditional methods by a wide margin.</p>

<p>FastGlioma has an exceptional average success rate of 92 percent, in detecting and calculating the remaining tumour from an operated patient. The new technology only missed the high-risk residual tumour only 3.8 percent of the time, compared to a 25 percent miss rate in conventional methods.</p>

<p>Such a tool could be a state-of-the-art innovation for the treatment of patients with brain cancer, according to the team of experts behind it from the University of Michigan and the University of California, San Francisco.</p>

<h3><br />
<strong>How it works</strong></h3>

<p>Removal of brain tumours has proven to be a difficult affair for neurosurgeons worldwide. The brain is an extremely sensitive organ, and surgical removal of tumours often leaves behind some cancerous mass. This can cause recurrence of cancer in patients, often leading to loss of life.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
Traditional methods to detect residual tumour tissue in neurosurgery employ MRI imaging during the surgery procedure, combined with use of fluorescent agents- a method that has the resource as well as specificity constraint as it only works on some types of tumours.</p>

<p>FastGlioma fills this gap by providing a quicker, more accessible and precise solution to this critical problem. It is an artificial intelligence system that is referred to as foundation models- similar to AI tool based on GPT-4 and DALL·E 3, trained on big datasets that can be tailored to several types of applications from image classification to generating text.</p>

<p>The model has been pre-trained on more than 11,000 surgical specimens and over 4 million unique microscopic fields of view for FastGlioma. The imaging is done through stimulated Raman histology- a high-resolution optical imaging technique developed at University of Michigan.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The technology works faster and more accurately than current standard of care methods for tumour detection and could be generalised to other paediatric and adult brain tumour diagnosis. It could serve as a foundational model for guiding brain tumour surgery." said Todd Hollon, M.D. Neurosurgeon at University of Michigan and co-author of the research paper. &nbsp;</p>

<p>FastGlioma has two modes; one with full resolution images that takes about 100 seconds, and a fast mode that has lower resolution images with just 10 seconds' output.&nbsp;<br />
"This means that we can detect tumour infiltration in seconds with extremely high accuracy, which could inform surgeons if more resection is needed during an operation," added Hollon.</p>

<p>The implications of this technology go beyond brain tumours. Researchers suggest that FastGlioma could be adapted for other types of brain tumours, including paediatric cases like medulloblastoma and ependymoma and non-glioma tumours, such as meningiomas.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>More than two dozen lawmakers and eminent Indian Americans celebrated Diwali at the Capitol, the first major event at the US Congress after last week's presidential elections.</p>

<p>The annual "Diwali at Capitol Hill" on Tuesday was organised by the BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir, in association with several other Indian American organisations including the Hindu American Foundation, Sikhs for America, Jain Association of North America, and Art of Living.</p>

<p>President-elect Donald Trump is set to assume office after winning the presidential election last week.</p>

<p>Speaking at the Diwali celebration, Senator Rand Paul said the US is a land of immigrants which attracts the best and brightest around the world, underscoring that they blend to make America a great country.</p>

<p>"I'm a big advocate of more lawful immigration and have many bills to expand that, and I'm going to keep working on that. Have a good Diwali," Paul said.</p>

<p>Greeting Indian Americans on the occasion, Mississippi Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith said she looks forward to the great next four years. "We want to just provide prosperity for this country, for those who want to look for something new, to do something new," she said.</p>

<p>"We just want to encourage you that we want to have a stable atmosphere. We want a great economy. We want a safe place for everybody to be able to raise your family," she said, addressing the gathering which also included India's Ambassador to the US Vinay Mohan Kwatra.</p>

<p>"This is an Indian festival which is embraced and celebrated the world over. Your presence here, the presence of so many congressmen and senators has made it all the most special. It is a reflection of their commitment to the relationship. Your presence there is a reflection of the important role that you at this festival place in the relationship," Kwatra said in his address.</p>

<p>Congressman Shri Thanedar, who was re-elected from the thirteenth Congressional district of Michigan last month, said in his first term he was able to form Hindu, Sikh, Jain and Buddhist caucuses for the first time in Congressional history.</p>

<p>"There's a lot that needs to be done. I'm working with the State Department on the attacks on Hindu temples and making sure our community is protected all across America. I'm also working with the State Department on the atrocities on the Hindus in Bangladesh," Thanedar said.</p>

<p>Congressman Tom Souzzi from New York referred to the recent attacks on Hindu temple in Long Island. "I spoke on the floor of the Congress, and I said that when Indian Americans, Hindu Americans, place their hands like this and say namaste, they are really recognising the divinity and the respect they have for the person in front of them, and we need more of that in our country today," he said.</p>

<p>In his address, Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi said, "You are the fastest-growing ethnic minority in America. You are the most prosperous, the best educated. One out of every seven doctors is a Desi."</p>

<p>"The words of support tonight are coming from members of Congress who greatly appreciate each of you taking time, not just to be at this Diwali event for another beautiful year, but of the year that has been so monumental in the growth and opportunity for so many of you here in the United States of America," Congressman Pete Sessions said in his remarks.</p>

<p>Congressman Dan Meuser recollected the joint address to the Congress by Prime Minister Narendra Modi last year and said he did a wonderful job.</p>

<p>"It stayed with me just how well he spoke about the importance of the American Indian relationship, how it needs to improve for economic reasons, and for national security reasons, and an overall peace for our world," he said.</p>

<p>"Our relationship will continue to grow. It's very, very important. We have a new president and a new Senate. We hope to be united, work together, find common ground, and do what's best for the United States, for India, for the world," Meuser said.</p>

<p>Former House Majority Leader Congressman Steny Hoyer applauded the contribution of Indian Americans to the country's progress. "On this Diwali, I come here to thank each and every one of you. America is stronger and better for those of you who came from India and who love America and who serve our fellow citizens," he said.</p>

<p>"We know that our Indian American community is one of our success stories. It is a part of the vibrancy of our incredible economy and so many communities...to the families across America recognising and celebrating Diwali, we salute you tonight," said Congresswoman Haley Stevens.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[The fate of millions of immigrants hangs in the balance as President-elect Donald Trump vows to scale back Temporary Protected Status (TPS).]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The fate of millions of immigrants hangs in the balance as President-elect Donald Trump vows to scale back Temporary Protected Status (TPS), a program that allows people from 17 countries, including Haiti, Afghanistan, Sudan, and Lebanon, to stay and work in the US if their homelands are deemed unsafe.</p>

<p>Currently, 7.7 million people are displaced due to political violence and economic turmoil in Venezuela - one of the biggest displacements worldwide. In Haiti and El Salvador, people are facing widespread gang violence, instability and economic hardships.</p>

<p>TPS currently protects over 1 million immigrants from these 17 countries. Designations for El Salvador, Sudan, Ukraine, and Venezuela are set to expire in March and April, respectively.</p>

<p>Established in 1990, TPS initially protected Salvadorans from civil war. Since then, designations have been extended to various countries facing conflicts, natural disasters, or extraordinary conditions. A designation does not guarantee permanent residency in the United States, however, applicants can try to change their status through various other immigration processes.</p>

<p>Trump's plans to stop mass parole and grants of TPS have sparked anxiety among beneficiaries. Vania Andre, editor-in-chief of The Haitian Times, emphasises that Haiti cannot absorb the return of thousands of people, given its existing widespread gang violence. Attorney Ahilan T. Arulanantham warns that stripping employment authorisation from TPS holders could be economically disastrous.</p>

<p>According to AP, Maribel Hidalgo's journey to the United States was nothing short of perilous. She fled Venezuela with her one-year-old son, traversing Panama's Darien Gap and Mexico, only to find solace in the US when the Biden administration granted Venezuelans TPS.</p>

<p>However, with President-elect Donald Trump vowing to scale back TPS, Hidalgo's future hangs in the balance. In October, JD Vance said "We're going to stop doing mass grants of Temporary Protected Status" in an Arizona rally.</p>

<p>"My only hope was TPS. My worry, for example, is that after everything I suffered with my son so that I could make it to this country, that they send me back again", Hidalgo said.</p>

<p>Advocates urge the White House to renew and expand TPS protections, particularly for Nicaraguans fleeing oppression. Maria Bilbao of the American Friends Service Committee calls it a "moral obligation" for the Biden administration to act. Elena, a 46-year-old Nicaraguan living in the US illegally for 25 years, hopes Biden moves quickly, fearing deportation.</p>

<p>Will the Biden administration act to protect them, or will Trump's promises of mass deportations become a harsh reality? Only time will tell.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Khalistani terrorist Arshdeep Dalla, an aide of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, was arrested by cops in Canada after he was injured in a gunfight with unknown shooters last month. He was taken to a hospital with bullet wounds to his right bicep but it led to his arrest when cops searched his car and house and found illegal firearms.</p>

<p>On October 28, Arshdeep Gill and Gurjant Singh were attacked by unknown shooters. Gill was injured and cops arrived at Guelph Hospital and later searched their vehicle and found bullet marks on their Dodge Durango SUV's driver's side and front window. The cops also found two casings on the passenger's seat, suggesting that Gill and Singh also fired back.</p>

<p>Arshdeep claimed that an unknown vehicle was chasing him and accidentally a bullet was fired in his vehicle, the investigating agencies said.</p>

<p>A day later, the cops searched their house and found a Taurus 9mm handgun with a loaded magazine which was inserted into a backpack. They also found a rifle a shotgun and two high-capacity magazines in a gun safe.</p>

<p>One magazine was capable of holding 15 rounds, while the other could hold 35 ammunition in the gun safe.</p>

<p>They were arrested for discharging a "firearm with intent", possession of a prohibited firearm with ammunition, tampering with the serial number of the guns and possession of ammunition and firearm without a license since the barrel length of the gun was 80 mm.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/khalistani-terrorist-arshdeep-dalla-aide-of-hardeep-singh-nijjar-arrested-in-canada-say-sources-6986687">Sources in Indian security agencies said </a>Dalla, 28, &nbsp;lives in Canada's Surrey with his wife. He is allegedly involved in multiple cases of extortion, murder and other terror-linked activities and has cases registered against him under UAPA. A Lookout Circular has been issued against him by the Punjab Police.</p>

<p>In a Facebook post, Dalla had taken responsibility for the murder of an electrician, Paramjeet Singh, from Punjab's Jagraon.</p>

<p>His associates had shot dead Manohar Lal, a Dera Sacha Sauda follower in November 2020.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He was also involved in hatching a conspiracy to kidnap and kill Shakti Singh, another Dera Sacha Sauda follower.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He also uses Facebook for recruiting and instigating young men to participate in his criminal activities.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2019-09/s0ltn3ig_trump-modi-afp_625x300_22_September_19.jpg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>The question topmost in the minds of our foreign policy makers and commentators is what to expect from US President Donald Trump's second term as regards our interests. Trump's unpredictability is a source of concern to all countries, whether allies, friends or adversaries. However, our experience of Trump's first term gives us confidence that his second presidency will generally see continuing progress in our ties, the foundations of which have been laid in the last couple of decades during the previous Republican and Democratic presidencies.</p>

<p>This would explain Indian External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar's comment that some countries may be nervous about Trump returning to power, but India is not. Some external commentators believe that Trump's re-election has been greeted with enthusiasm in India because they see him as a kindred spirit of Modi, both being right-wing ideological conservatives. This echoes the Modi-bashing narrative promoted in Western progressive, left-wing, human rights, minority rights circles. Modi, no doubt, got along very well personally with Trump, but so he did with Biden, and, before him, with Obama, too. Just as elements of the policies of Biden and Obama were problematic for India, so were aspects of Trump's policies.</p>

<h2><strong>Relief, Not Enthusiasm</strong></h2>

<p>At policymaking levels and amongst discerning commentators, there is no "enthusiasm" as such. There might be a feeling of some relief that the Trump administration would stay away on some issues on which the Democrats have harangued us. On these issues, there was a degree of political synergy between the opposition in India and Democratic circles, to the point of even inviting US interference in our internal affairs. This would still be the undercurrent in India-US ties as the Democratic ecosystem in the media, academia, think tanks, "progressive" Congressional circles, etc, will remain active. But this will not be part of the government narrative as before.</p>

<p>There is a caveat though. The annual reports on human rights, religious freedoms, etc, issued by the US State Department are mandated by the US Congress, and these will contain the usual salvos against India. One can expect that unlike Blinken, who, unprecedentedly, singled out India twice by name while presenting the reports, his successor is unlikely to do so. But we should keep in mind that Christian Evangelists are amongst those who strongly support Trump and could work as a pressure point within the administration on issues relating to Christian "persecution", the conversion issue and restrictions on NGOs in India.</p>

<h2><strong>What The New Appointments Mean For India</strong></h2>

<p>There is much interest globally in the appointments that Trump makes to key positions in his administration. India has reason to be satisfied with his nomination of Marc Rubio to the post of Secretary of State and Mike Waltz as the National Security Adviser. Rubio is a strong supporter of more robust defence, space and technology ties with India. He introduced the US-India Defense Cooperation Act in the Senate in July 2024, which aims to bolster cooperation in these areas with India, besides seeking exemption for it from the CAATSA (Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act) legislation and restricting US assistance to Pakistan. As a China hawk, he also sees India as a counterbalance to China.</p>

<p>Mike Waltz is the Republican Co-Chair of the India Caucus, which means that he has an understanding of India-related issues, has been receptive to India's concerns, has been an advocate of strong US-India ties, and is well-connected to the Indian diaspora. He believes that the US-India partnership was the most important strategic relationship of the 21st century. One can assume that he will, like Jake Sullivan, continue to lead the iCET (Initiative for Critical and Emerging Technologies) from the US side, with our National Security Advisor (NSA), Ajit Doval, as his counterpart. This is important.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Both are China hawks, which means that the Quad and the Indo-Pacific Strategy will continue to be strongly backed by the White House and the State Department. Kurt Campbell, earlier in Biden's White House and later appointed as Deputy Secretary of State in the State Department, was a strong proponent of the Quad and the Indo-Pacific strategy. He will most probably leave his post, but both Rubio and Waltz would ensure that this part of the India-US strategic cooperation, which also has the China challenge in view, continues unabated.</p>

<h2><strong>Caution Is Foremost</strong></h2>

<p>India will be hosting the next Quad summit in 2025, which means that Trump should be coming to India very early in his tenure-a bonus because the bureaucracies in both countries will get galvanised to make the visit substantive in content and give a direction to India-US ties also at the bilateral level.</p>

<p>We need to be cautious though in not being pushed, beyond a certain point, into subscribing to the Trump administration's hawkishness on China. Our ties with Beijing will remain a massive challenge to us strategically, even if there has been some positive movement on the border recently. It amounts to some lessening of tensions but not an end to them, as Chinese policies will remain unpredictable. We will need hedging strategies, for which the Quad and the Indo-Pacific strategy are indispensable. We need to keep in mind our stakes in BRICS and the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) as part of maintaining a balance in our foreign policy and retaining some cards to play to preserve our strategic autonomy.</p>

<h2><strong>Trump, China And Russia</strong></h2>

<p>We will also have to keep in view that there are inherent contradictions in the US policy towards China, and Trump's approach is not free of them. Trump does not want to get involved in wars abroad anymore, which means he will want to use diplomatic and economic tools to deal with China's expansionism and its threat to US global pre-eminence. How much China can and will exploit this contradiction to continue asserting itself in the Western Pacific and beyond, with the economic power at its disposal that gets inevitably translated into political influence, remains to be seen.</p>

<p>Trump's inclination to resolve the Ukraine conflict will potentially ease tensions, benefiting India and the Global South. Whether he succeeds, or, if rebuffed, ups the ante to exert more pressure on Russia, remains to be seen. If a direct dialogue begins with the US and Russia, then the pressure on Modi to act as an intermediary between Russia and Ukraine and find some common ground will end. Zelenskyy's latest 'Victory Plan' to establish peace will also become redundant. Trump and his nominees for the State Department, the NSA and the Pentagon are extremely pro-Israel, and this does not bode well for peace in West Asia. Trump's anti-Iran stance is not reassuring either for the region or for India.</p>

<h2><strong>Economic Pain Points</strong></h2>

<p>On the economic side, we had pressure from Trump during his first term when the US excluded us from the Generalised Scheme of Preferences (GSP) and imposed tariffs on our steel and aluminium exports to the US. During his campaign, he has referred to India as a "tariff king" and a 'trade abuser', even as he has spoken very warmly about Modi personally. He has threatened to impose 60% tariffs on Chinese exports to the US and 10-20% tariffs on imports from other countries. Many in Indian economic circles believe that we could handle a 10% tariff, in fact, and with much higher import duties on China, we could even benefit in some areas. There is concern that Trump might tighten up on H1B visas, the stronger controls on technology transfers from the US might affect us too, and Trump's determination to push American corporations to invest in the US and create jobs there might alter the discourse on friend-shoring or resilient supply chains, etc.</p>

<p>The nomination of Robert Lighthiser, the US Trade Representative in Trump's first term and someone India found difficult to deal with, to define US trade policy in the president's second term will be problematic all around. He is truly a trade hawk who wants to use US economic power aggressively to protect the country's interests as he perceives them, to the point of wrecking the World Trade Organization (WTO), if he can.</p>

<h2><strong>Counting On Modi-Trump Rapport</strong></h2>

<p>India has the advantage, even with these difficulties, of a personal rapport between Modi and Trump and political backing prospectively in the State Department and at the level of the National Security Advisor, not to mention in the US Congress, to counter undue trade pressures. Even on the US side, they will have to take the totality of US long-term interests in India to fashion a balanced policy approach.</p>

<p>Finally, we can hope that the approach of the Biden administration on the Nijjar and Pannun affairs will become more discreet rather than one that resorts to unquestioningly supporting Trudeau, talking down at India by demanding satisfaction and accountability, and giving free rein to Pannun to threaten India with terrorism, death threats, etc. Trump has called Trudeau 'weak', 'dishonest' and 'two-faced'. That holds out some hope that Trudeau will become less provocative. One must keep in mind though that as the Pannun case is before courts, information on the proceedings will make news that anti-Indian elements abroad will pick up and which our press will play up.</p>

<p>Interesting times ahead.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is nothing more beautiful than a mother's love and only the mother can go to any length for their children. In a remarkable display of motherly love and courage, a video is doing rounds of the internet in which a mother leopard is seen fighting a lion head-on, to save her two cubs. The incident was recorded inside Serengeti National Park in Tanzania, by Carol and Bob, a couple on an African adventure.</p>

<p>The video shared on October 24, by the YouTube channel “LatestSightings”, details the incident.</p>

<p>Carol and Bob, along with ranger Godliving Shoo, started a Safari ride, early in the morning. Godliving knew of a leopard denning in the area and thought it would be a great time to try and spot her. Before they knew it, the duo spotted the leopard. And her two cubs doubled up as the cherry on top.</p>

<p></p>

<p><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="400" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WH3mYLRmYgA" title="Leopard Mom Sacrifices Herself To Protect Her Cubs" width="700"></iframe></p>

<p>But something was off.</p>

<p>The leopard was seen standing on the top of a rock, in a state of paranoia.</p>

<p>“The leopard was outside her den when my husband spotted a lioness crouched just a few meters away, watching intently in the same general direction,” recalled Carol. “We initially thought two separate events were unfolding — the leopard and her cubs, and the lioness watching the wildebeest in the distance. But as she crept forward, we realised she was actually focused on the leopards!”, she added.</p>

<p>The lion walked in. And the leopard jumped and went all in, without worrying about her own life. The fierce leopard kicked the lioness and made her jump back, holding her paw like an injured puppy.</p>

<p>The cubs used this time to hide. When the lioness jumped back, the leopard too escaped.</p>

<p>According to the report, the leopard had to move her cubs twice that afternoon. “She did seem to be exhausted but was left with only minor injuries. As for the lioness, she was left with a very sore leg.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Donald Trump is likely to get a healthy majority in the Senate this time around. However, despite that he may not have the magic 60 seats that would allow him to overcome opposition attempts to delay legislation.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President-elect Donald Trump's Republican Party has won enough seats to retain its control over both chambers of Congress - the House of Representatives and the Senate - cementing its dominant performance in the 2024 United States elections. In Washington DC's political parlance, when a president's party also controls the Congress, it is called "a governing trifecta".</p>

<p>With Republicans cementing their grip on the "Washington trifecta", Mr Trump, after taking charge of the Oval Office, will have much more sweeping authority over the next year to implement his legislative priorities, including major poll promises to enact immigration controls and reduce regulations on Wall Street and the energy industry among others.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-11/0g874728_donald-trump-afp-_625x300_14_November_24.jpeg?im=FaceCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=1200,height=738" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>Had he not won majorities in Congress, Mr Trump's resounding victory over Democrat rival Kamala Harris would still have given him significant control over the formation of the federal government and US foreign policy, both of which are likely to see a significant change during his administration. However, with a governing "trifecta", the incoming President will also be able to get easier approvals for his nominees for posts in his administration - something he had struggled with during his first term back in 2017 when internal resistance within the Republican Party was significantly higher.</p>

<h2><strong>How Does US Congress Work?</strong></h2>

<p>The US Congress has a total of 535 members, including 100 representatives in the Senate and 435 in the House of Representatives. Each of the 50 states in the US sends two Senators to the US Senate. However, the state's representation in the House of Representatives is based on its population. For example, a smaller state like Vermont has one representative while large states like California have 53 representatives</p>

<p>The term of members of the House of Representatives is two years and all 435 seats are considered for reelection every even year. This marks a stark contrast with the Senate, the upper chamber of Congress, where senators serve six-year terms. Elections to the Senate are staggered over even years so that only about 1/3 of the Senate is up for reelection during any election.</p>

<p>The single-party control of Congress, which was once common, has become rare and short over the past few decades, with the party in power losing seats when midterm congressional elections are held every two years. Both former President Trump and President Joe Biden enjoyed "trifectas" for their first two years in the White House, but the dynamics changed following midterm polls.</p>

<h3><strong>Does 'Trifecta' Guarantee Absolute Power?</strong></h3>

<p>A 'trifecta' is no guarantee against political infighting. Despite the Biden administration having "trifecta" from 2021 to 2023, internal dissent stymied certain policy priorities, with figures like Arizona's independent Senator Kyrsten Sinema resisting party orthodoxy.</p>

<p>A major obstacle in the way of total control by either party is that it requires a three-fifths majority - or 60 votes out of 100 - to pass bills in the Senate. Therefore, to bypass the filibuster or the tradition of unlimited debate, a party needs a healthy majority in the Senate. Hence, should a party have a simple majority in the Senate, it needs to reach across the aisle to get a bill passed.</p>

<p>As per a report in the New York Times, Mr Trump is likely to get a healthy majority in the Senate this time around. However, despite that, he may not have the magic 60 seats that would allow him to overcome opposition attempts to delay legislation.</p>

<p>Moreover, there are already signs that Donald Trump may not have his way at all times, with his party selecting John Thune as the Senate majority leader despite Rick Scott being reportedly favoured for the post by by Trump.</p>

<p>Though Mr Trump did not officially endorse Scott, the American media is seeing Mr Thune's selection as a sign that some Republican lawmakers are asserting their independence.</p>

<h3><strong>How The "Trifecta" Can Benefit Trump</strong></h3>

<p>All said, if managed astutely, a "trifecta" can open the way for the possibility of significant legislative initiatives. A majority in both chambers of Congress may give Mr Trump an advantage in pushing through his right-wing agenda and big poll promises like the largest deportation of migrants in history, sweeping tariffs on foreign imports, and the rolling back of environmental protections.</p>

<p>As per the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/13/us/elections/republican-house-trifecta.html" rel="No follow, no index" target="_blank">NYT</a> report, using legislation to achieve these goals will make them much harder to overturn in the courts, especially with the judicial landscape also in Mr Trump's favour. In his first term, the former President was able to put three conservatives in the Supreme Court - cementing a two-thirds majority for years to come. He also named more than four dozen judges to the federal appeals courts, bending several circuits to a more conservative bent.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A latest survey by Bumble, the women-first dating app, reveals that dating habits are changing globally, especially for Gen Z women. In reality, they're just raising the bar and demanding greater sincerity, even though some people might think they're giving up dating completely.</p>

<p>More than 40,000 Gen Z and millennial Bumble users worldwide, including over 2,000 singles in India, participated in <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://bumble-buzz.com/bumble-dating-trends-2025/">the survey,</a> which found that dating is changing as people become more optimistic about the difficulties of finding the appropriate partner.</p>

<p><strong>Key Dating Trends for 2025:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Micro-mance:</strong> Romance is making a comeback, with over half of women globally embracing their romantic side.</p>

<p><strong>DWM (Date With Me):</strong> Real and raw dating content is gaining popularity, as 41% of singles globally appreciate the honest portrayal of dating experiences.</p>

<p><strong>On The Same (Fan) Page:</strong> Shared interests and hobbies are becoming powerful attraction boosters, with 60% of UK singles recognizing the importance of quirky connections.</p>

<p><strong>Male Casting: </strong>Men are challenging traditional gender roles and stereotypes, prompting conversations about masculinity and its impact on relationships.</p>

<p><strong>Future-Proofing: </strong>Concerns about the future are influencing dating choices, with women prioritizing stability and emotional reliability in partners.</p>

<p><strong>Guys That Get It:</strong> Men are evolving into better friends and support systems, fostering deeper connections with women.</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://bumble-buzz.com/bumble-dating-trends-2025/">Bumble's research</a>, women are looking for real connections and aren't prepared to lower their standards any more. They place a high priority on emotional connection, honesty, and shared values. Men are therefore being urged to be more genuine, sympathetic, and helpful.</p>

<p>The quest for deeper connections is the driving force behind this change in dating dynamics. People who are single are actively looking for companions who can provide emotional support, understand their goals, and share their beliefs. The emphasis on creating enduring relationships is replacing the days of casual dating.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Adapting to a sea level rise of up to 0.5 metres (1.64 feet) will cost the three most vulnerable Pacific atoll nations nearly $10 billion - equivalent to about 20 years of gross domestic product - the World Bank said in a report on Thursday.</p>

<p>Kiribati, Tuvalu and Marshall Islands are among the smallest, most remote and dispersed countries in the world, spread across 6.4 million square kilometres (2.47 million square miles) of Pacific Ocean, where residents live at an elevation of no more than 2-3 metres, the report said.</p>

<p>A third of the population of Kiribati and Tuvalu are at risk of falling into extreme poverty from climate shocks such as coastal flooding, while healthcare is under pressure from increased heat-related illness, it said.</p>

<p>A sea level rise of 0.5 metres, which would submerge significant portions of these nations, could occur as soon as 2050 under a worst case scenario, or more likely by 2070, and it was imperative for governments to act on adaptation plans now, it said.</p>

<p>Money is a central focus of the COP29 climate talks being held in Azerbaijan and the success of the summit is likely to be judged on whether nations can agree a new target for how much richer nations, development lenders and the private sector must provide each year to developing countries to finance climate action.</p>

<p>The Pacific atolls face a significant climate funding gap, the World Bank report said.</p>

<p>The cost of physical adaptation, by building seawalls in urban centres, house raising and inland relocation, for a sea level rise of up to 0.5 metres, was estimated at $3.7 billion for Kiribati, $1 billion for Tuvalu, and $5 billion for Marshall Islands.</p>

<p>"This represents about 20 years of current GDP dedicated fully to physical adaptation measures," the report said.</p>

<p>The estimate excludes the cost of other adaptation measures needed in health, education, power and water systems.</p>

<p>Importing sand and rock to build sea walls and raise and reclaim shorelines will also be costly and challenging, it added.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Indian-American entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy on Wednesday reacted to his high school graduation speech video that is doing rounds on social media. Sharing the clip on X (formerly Twitter), the biotech investor said that he was "against bureaucracy back then too" - with a laughing emoji.</p>

<p>Mr Ramaswamy's comment reflects that his ideologies go much back in time.</p>

<p>In the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/vivek-ramaswamys-high-school-graduation-speech-goes-viral-ahead-of-doge-appointment-with-elon-musk-7015437">22-year-old video</a>, a young Mr Ramaswamy is seen addressing his graduating class and guests at Ohio's St. Xavier High School. In the speech, he reflects on his journey through high school.</p>

<p>"I have been racing my entire high school career, but now, when we are finally crossing the finish line, I wish I could have stopped, just a little earlier, and catch a breath of the fresh air that has surrounded me the whole time," he said.</p>

<p>Drawing literary references from his English class, Ramaswamy said, "It is better to travel than it is to arrive" - admitting to having mixed feelings about the moment - graduating high school.</p>

<p>"How am I supposed to feel right now?" he asked, processing his final moments at the university.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">I was against bureaucracy back then too. ? <a href="https://t.co/zVJiDCTMWh">https://t.co/zVJiDCTMWh</a></p>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Born and raised in Cincinnati, Ohio, Mr Ramaswamy was a nationally-ranked tennis player and the valedictorian of his high school. He graduated in Biology from Harvard and received his J D (Juris Doctor) from Yale Law School while working at a hedge fund.</p>

<p>After completing his education, Mr Ramaswamy started his own biotech company, Roivant Sciences - where he oversaw the development of five drugs that went on to become FDA-approved.</p>

<p>In 2022, he founded Strive, an Ohio-based asset management firm.</p>

<p>Recently, US President-elect Donald Trump appointed Mr Ramaswamy and tech billionaire Elon Musk as leads of 'Department of Government Efficiency' - a new wing in the US government. However, these roles are informal and are outside the government - which will not need Senate approval.</p>

<p>According to Trump, Musk and Ramaswamy's mission under this department will be to dismantle government bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure federal agencies.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Boeing Co. will start sending out pink slips on Wednesday to employees affected by a planned round of job cuts, a delicate balancing act between improving efficiency and keeping together a skilled workforce to help lift output again.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The company announced a 10% reduction in positions last month, equivalent to about 17,000 employees. The move is aimed at restoring Boeing's competitive edge as it reels from multiple crises, including reduced output in the wake of a near-catastrophic accident in January and a strike that shut down most of its production for seven weeks.</p>

<p>But if Boeing cuts too deep or in the wrong places, it risks undermining its eventual recovery from years of turmoil. Manufacturers like Boeing used to count on a large portion of furloughed workers to eventually return to work. That pattern was broken when its Covid-era layoffs spurred a permanent exodus, including top-flight engineers and mechanics.&nbsp;</p>

<p>And these days, workers have more options. Unemployment in Seattle is hovering at 4% and aerospace workers are in high demand, particularly with the region's booming space economy.</p>

<p>Rivals like SpaceX, Blue Origin LLC and Amazon.com Inc.'s Project Kuiper are all searching for new hires to support rapidly growing operations around Seattle, where Boeing manufactures most of its commercial airplanes, said Stan Shull, a space industry analyst and consultant at Alliance Velocity LLC. The opportunities range from working on Starlink satellites for Elon Musk's space venture to helping with rockets, space stations, lunar landers and the like for Jeff Bezos's rival company.</p>

<p><strong>Tight Market</strong></p>

<p>There are about 1,350 job openings at more than 50 space companies in the Puget Sound region, by Shull's count. While engineers of all stripes are in demand, the companies are also searching for machinists, administrative help, sales and marketing staff and other positions, said Shull.</p>

<p>Shifting demographics within the US workforce and continued low unemployment mean Boeing will face more competition when it needs to resume hiring to support its growth, said Richard Aboulafia, a managing director with AeroDynamic Advisory.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"It works fine as long as labor markets aren't tight," Aboulafia said in an interview. "But aerospace and defense labor markets are really tight."</p>

<p>Besides, rolling out blanket workforce cuts are "the surest formula for losing 10% of your best people" who will gravitate to potentially more stable employers, Aboulafia said.</p>

<p>The lost institutional knowledge was apparent as the company made only halting progress ramping up manufacturing of its 737 Max jetliner this decade. Executives later acknowledged they'd underestimated the training required to bring the large influx of new hires up to speed in their factories.</p>

<p><strong>'Reset Priorities'</strong></p>

<p>Even so, the company is staffed for peak production levels it likely won't see for years, especially after a 53-day strike largely halted work in its plants across the west coast. Boeing had 171,000 employees at the start of this year, 12% more than the 153,000 it employed five years earlier, when its factories were at their pre-crisis peak.</p>

<p>Relations between workers and Boeing hit a low during the strike that just ended. Boeing was finally able to settle the dispute with concessions including a 38% wage improvement, but many employees remain antagonized by a company they say has not paid them fairly for years.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Kelly Ortberg, who was hired in August as chief executive officer to turn around Boeing, has said the 10% workforce reduction is part of a broader campaign to cut out bloat and inefficiency.</p>

<p>"We need to reset priorities and create a leaner, more focused organization," Ortberg said during an Oct. 23 earnings call. The cuts are intended to "focus on consolidation of areas where we're not efficient, and we need to continue to focus on reducing non-essential activity."&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President-elect Donald Trump and Tesla CEO Elon Musk took the stage at Mar-a-Lago on Wednesday night to perform a rendition of<em> 'God Bless America' </em>alongside opera singer Christopher Macchio. The event took place as Musk joined Trump and other supporters for election night celebrations. The duo's impromptu duet quickly gained traction on social media after being shared by Trump's aide, Margo Martin. Notably, the performance came just a day after Trump announced Elon Musk's new role leading the Department of Government Efficiency in his administration, alongside Vivek Ramaswamy.</p>

<p>Musk, who had endorsed Trump and contributed significant funding to pro-Trump initiatives, has become an influential ally in Trump's recent political efforts. On Wednesday,&nbsp;Musk was appointed to co-lead the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/elon-musk-to-lead-us-government-efficiency-department-donald-trump-7006239#pfrom=home-ndtv_topscroll">Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)</a>&nbsp;alongside Vivek Ramaswamy, a fellow Trump supporter and entrepreneur.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Together, these two wonderful Americans will pave the way for my Administration to dismantle Government Bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure Federal Agencies - Essential to the 'Save America' Movement," Trump said in a statement.</p>

<p>Notably, Mar-a-Lago is a historic estate and private club in Palm Beach, Florida, owned by Donald Trump. Originally built in the 1920s by heiress Marjorie Merriweather Post, the 126-room mansion spans over 17 acres, including beachfront property. Trump purchased Mar-a-Lago in 1985 and later converted it into a private membership club. Known for its opulent architecture and lavish decor, it serves as both a social hub and Trump's winter residence, frequently hosting political events, fundraisers, and gatherings for high-profile guests.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President-elect Donald Trump has named former Democratic representative-turned-staunch supporter Tulsi Gabbard as the Director of National Intelligence for his second term. As part of her job, she will oversee 18 spy agencies in the United States.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After leaving the Democratic Party in 2022, Gabbard endorsed Trump earlier this year. A veteran and one-time Democratic White House contender, Gabbard brings the "fearless spirit that has defined her illustrious career to our intelligence community," Trump said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Gabbard, who earlier opposed US support for Ukraine, thanked the President-elect for the opportunity, adding she was looking forward to getting to work."</p>

<p>With Gabbard all set to succeed Avril Haines as the Director of National Intelligence, here are five facts about her:</p>

<h2><strong>1. Early Life</strong></h2>

<p>Tulsi Gabbard was born on April 12, 1981, in Leloaloa, American Samoa. When she was two years old, her family settled in Hawaii. As a teenager, she co-founded the Healthy Hawai'i Coalition, an environmental non-profit. She completed a B.S.B.A. in Business Administration from the Hawaii Pacific University in 2009. Her father, Mike Gabbard, switched from the Republican Party to Democrats and is a Hawaii State Senator. She is married to Abraham Williams, a cinematographer.</p>

<h2><strong>2. Military Service</strong></h2>

<p>Gabbard has served for over two decades in the Army National Guard. She was deployed to Iraq and Kuwait. In 2005, she was honoured with a Combat Medical Badge for "participation in combat operations under enemy hostile fire in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom III," per the Hawaii National Guard. Although Gabbard has not held any senior government roles unlike past directors, she has two years of experience on the House Homeland Security Committee.</p>

<h2><strong>3. First Hindu elected to Congress</strong></h2>

<p>Gabbard was elected to Hawaii's House of Representatives at 21 but had to leave after a single term following her National Guard unit's deployment to Iraq. Later, she was elected to Congress where she represented Hawaii. She became the first Hindu member of the House and was sworn into office with her hand on the Bhagavad Gita. She was also the first American Samoan elected to Congress.</p>

<h2><strong>4. Presidential aspirations and party exit</strong></h2>

<p>In 2020, Gabbard came into the spotlight, seeking the Democratic nomination for the President. She opposed the country's involvement in foreign military conflicts. She later opted out of the race and endorsed Joe Biden, who eventually won the election. After nearly two years, she left the Democratic Party.</p>

<h2><strong>5. Trump campaign</strong></h2>

<p>Earlier this year, Gabbard extended support to Donald Trump, receiving popularity among his supporters. At a rally in North Carolina in October, she officially announced becoming a Republican and termed the current Democratic Party "completely unrecognisable".</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A fossilised skeleton, Australopithecus afarensis, best known by her nickname 'Lucy', was unearthed by researchers 50 years ago this month in the Afar region of Ethiopia. It eventually went on to transform scientists' understanding of human evolution.<br />
<br />
Opening a new chapter in human history, the discovery by Don Johanson, an American palaeontologist and graduate student Tom Gray on November 24, 1974, provided proof that the ancient hominins could walk upright on two feet 3.2 million years ago — a trait thought to have evolved more recently, <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/12/science/lucy-fossil-discovery-50th-anniversary-don-johanson/index.html">CNN </a>reported.<br />
<br />
Lucy had a mixture of ape and humanlike traits, suggesting she occupied a pivotal branch in the family tree of humans. Over the past few decades, she has encouraged multiple researches and debates, besides igniting a broader public fascination with human origins.<br />
<br />
Although researchers have now unearthed fossil hominins twice as old as Lucy, she continues to remain a key subject for scientific studies.<br />
<br />
At the time when it was found, Lucy had 47 bones and was the oldest known and the most complete skeleton of early human ancestors.<br />
<br />
Reminiscing his 1974 Ethiopia visit, Don Johanson told CNN he was walking on sediment 3.2 million years in age to search for the fossilised remains of various kinds of animals, "but particularly the remains of our ancestors."&nbsp;<br />
<br />
"I happened to look over my right shoulder. If I had looked over my left shoulder, I would have missed it," he said.<br />
<br />
At first, he witnessed a little fragment of bone, a little part of the elbow as well as a part of a forearm.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
He could tell "immediately that it was from a human ancestor," Johanson said, adding when he and his student, Tom Gray, kneeled to have a closer look, they saw "fragments of the skull and fragments of a pelvis and fragments of an arm bone and the leg bone."&nbsp;<br />
<br />
"I realized at that moment that here was the childhood dream... I'd always wanted to go to Africa to find something and by golly this was something. But we didn't know how much it would become an icon in the study of human origins," Johanson said.<br />
<br />
At the time of discovery, Lucy's bones were "very fragile" because they had mineralised and changed into stone. So, the team did a "very careful crawl to pick up the obvious pieces," before they put them into the burlap bags.<br />
<br />
Later, they water-washed them in the stream via fine screening. The whole process took two and a half weeks.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Johanson recalled it was wonderful to see Lucy come together on the lab table in the field. "The femur there was only about a foot long, or 28 centimetres long. What is this? I thought. Is this a child? Well, let's look at the jaw. The wisdom teeth had erupted so she was an adult. But my god, if this was an adult, it had to have been only about 3 and a half feet tall, a meter tall," he added.<br />
<br />
Asked how it got the name Lucy, Johanson said it had a delicate nature of the bones and the short stature, so they felt "she was probably a female."<br />
<br />
He went on to say that while Lucy's species did not give rise directly to modern humans, "her pivotal place on the human family tree led to all later hominin species, most of which went extinct."&nbsp;<br />
<br />
"The Homo lineage persisted and ultimately gave rise to us, Homo sapiens," he concluded.<br />
<br />
<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Imagine a wheelchair equipped with wheels flexible enough to navigate all manner of obstacles from kerbs to humps and even staircases.</p>

<p>Or perhaps an unmanned delivery vehicle using the same wheels that take the stairs to deliver food and groceries right to your doorstop.</p>

<p>This is what researchers from the Korea Institute of Machinery and Materials (KIMM) envision for their 'morphing' wheel, which can roll over obstacles up to 1.3 times the height of its radius.</p>

<p>Inspired by the surface tension of water droplets, it goes from solid to fluid when it encounters impediments.</p>

<p>Other possible applications include robots that spy on the enemy in the battlefield.</p>

<p>The KIMM team also hopes that morphing wheels will eventually be used with two and four-legged robots, which are currently limited in movement efficiency and susceptible to vibration, that can carry payloads that need stable movement in industrial settings.</p>

<p>"The goal is to make this viable for speed up to 100 kph, or the speed of an average car," said Song Sung-hyuk, principal researcher at South Korea's KIMM.</p>

<p>Wheels developed for a similar purpose such as non-pneumatic or airless tires have flexibility but are limited in their ability to overcome obstacles, said Song, who is a member of KIMM's AI robotics research team.</p>

<p>The morphing wheel consists of an outer hoop of a chain and a series of spoke wires running through the hub. The stiffness of the spokes - and hence the wheel - is automatically regulated by a sensor as it reacts to the terrain.</p>

<p>Song's team demonstrated to Reuters a prototype wheelchair mounted on morphing wheels as it climbed stairs with 18 cm steps with a life-size dummy sitting in it. The team has also tested a device mounted with the wheel at speeds of up to 30 kph.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 22-year-old Chinese woman's account of how she was lured into the country's illegal surrogacy industry before suffering a miscarriage went viral on Chinese social media this week and raised heated debates over women's rights and social inequality.</p>

<p>Surrogacy is banned in China, and authorities have vowed to severely crack down on illegal practices, including the buying and selling of sperm, egg, and surrogacy services.</p>

<p>The incident comes as Chinese authorities grapple with how to increase the country's birth rate as more young couples put off having children or opt to have none.</p>

<p>China's population fell for a second consecutive year in 2023 and Beijing in October rallied local governments to direct resources towards fixing China's population crisis to create a "birth-friendly" society.</p>

<p>Zhang Jing, 22, told state-backed Phoenix TV magazine that she donated her eggs out of financial desperation and then agreed to "rent out her uterus" to be impregnated for a total of 30,000 yuan ($4,152).</p>

<p>If she "successfully" delivered the baby, she would be paid a total of 240,000 yuan. At five months pregnant, she experienced severe complications and had to have an abortion.</p>

<p>Zhang's story amassed more than 86 million views and 10,000 comments on the Chinese social media platform Weibo, with the hashtag "#2000s-born Surrogate Miscarriage Girl Speaks Out#."</p>

<p>The majority of comments strongly opposed surrogacy. Some warned that legalising surrogacy in China could lead to increased competition that would lower compensation and further devalue women.</p>

<p>"No woman could escape this if surrogacy were legalised," one user wrote, while another said, "Legalising surrogacy would drive down prices and commodify women."</p>

<p>Zhang's story ignited calls for a more thorough crackdown on illegal surrogacy by authorities, with some commenters warning that allowing the black market to continue to operate could even normalise human organ trafficking.</p>

<p>"Life should not be traded as a commodity," one user wrote. "If this extends to the sale of organs, it will only get darker and darker, and women will have no future."</p>

<p>The incident comes a few weeks after a 28-year-old pregnant woman who acted as a surrogate in China's southwestern city of Chengdu was allegedly abandoned by her surrogacy agency.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Commonwealth of Dominica will honour Prime Minister Narendra Modi with its highest national award, the Dominica Award of Honour, in recognition of his contributions to Dominica during the COVID-19 pandemic. The award will also recognise PM Modi's dedication to strengthening the partnership between India and Dominica. Sylvanie Burton, President of the Commonwealth of Dominica will present the award during the India-CARICOM Summit in Georgetown, Guyana next week.</p>

<p>During the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, in February 2021, PM Modi supplied Dominica with 70,000 doses of the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine—"a generous gift which enabled Dominica to extend support to its Caribbean neighbours”, notes the press release issued by the Prime Minister's office.</p>

<p>Dominica appreciates India's support not just in the healthcare sector but also in education, and information technology. It also recognises India's role in promoting climate resilience-building initiatives and sustainable development on a global level.</p>

<p>“Prime Minister Modi has been a true partner to Dominica, particularly during our time of need amid a global health crisis. It is an honour to present him with Dominica's highest national accolade as a symbol of our gratitude for his support and as a reflection of the strong ties between our countries,” said PM Skerrit.</p>

<p>PM Skerrit showed interest in building on this partnership and working on the common goal of progress and resilience.</p>

<p>As per the official release, PM Modi accepted the offer of the award and emphasised the importance of collaboration in tackling global challenges such as climate change and geopolitical conflicts. PM Modi affirmed India's commitment to working alongside Dominica and the Caribbean in addressing these issues.</p>]]></content:encoded>

According to <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://fox8.com/news/human-head-washes-up-on-beach-in-key-biscayne-florida/">Fox News</a></em>, a beach maintenance worker found the remains near the Key Colony II Ocean Sound condos while raking the sand.&nbsp;Investigators were quickly called to the scene, and aerial helicopter footage showed them covering the remains with a blue tarp as they conducted their examination. The shocking find has sparked mystery surrounding the identity and age of the individual and the circumstances leading to the tragic event.</p>

<p>Preliminary findings suggest that the head belongs to a man, as confirmed by Miami-Dade Police Detective Andre Martin. Mr Martin noted that it's currently uncertain whether the individual was a victim of a crime or if other factors, such as a marine animal encounter or boating accident, resulted in the decapitation.</p>

<p>"We have not been able to determine exactly how the head became separated from the body, but there are a couple [of] working theories," he said.</p>

<p>Locals said the disturbing find has left them traumatised, with some saying that they are now too scared to go to the beach. Resident Bahman Amini said, "We have seen all things here but nothing like this what was found this morning, the head of a person. It makes us scared to go to the beach that we love."</p>

<p>Alex Portuondo told<em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.cbsnews.com/miami/news/miami-dade-police-investigate-report-of-head-human-on-key-biscayne-beach/">&nbsp;CBS</a></em>, "That's pretty scary and crazy. I&nbsp;have never heard of anything like this happening before on this kind of beach. I guess I am curious if they have any information on where it came from if anything else has been found if it happened here on the island or washed up on the shore."</p>

<p>''This is shocking, shocking. You don't hear a lot about that. You heard about drugs washing up on shore and things like that, but a head,''&nbsp;another resident said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The local medical examiner's office now has custody of the remains and is working to identify the person. The beach is a popular destination for tourists and locals alike.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Search and rescue operations continued in Nepal for the third consecutive day on Monday after monsoon-induced floods and landslides killed more than 200 people in one of the worst rain-related disasters in the Himalayan nation in recent years.</p>

<p>Incessant rainfall over the weekend triggered floods and landslides, wreaking havoc in Kathmandu and most of the districts of Nepal.</p>

<p>At least 204 people have been killed in the continuous rainfall, floods, landslides and inundation, MyRepublica news portal reported, quoting the Armed Police Force (APF).</p>

<p>It added that 89 others have also been injured nationwide in the disaster, while 33 others remain missing.</p>

<p>An all-party meeting convened on Sunday by Officiating Prime Minister Prakash Man Singh at the Prime Minister's Office in Singha Durbar decided to enhance rescue, relief, and re-establishment efforts during the ongoing disaster caused by heavy rains.</p>

<p>The Home Ministry said it would provide grants for temporary housing construction, repair blocked roads to restore transportation and ensure effective free health treatment for citizens injured in disaster incidents.</p>

<p>A task force was also formed to assess the details of the damage caused within a 15-day deadline, the news portal reported.</p>

<p>The Disaster Management Executive Committee&nbsp;said it will provide a relief amount to the families of those missing. If the missing person is not found within 10 days, their family will be provided the same amount as that given to the kin of a person killed in the rain-induced disaster, the report said.</p>

<p>The Home Ministry said all security agencies have been deployed for relief efforts following the floods and landslides, and the Nepal Army, Nepal Police and Armed Police Force personnel have rescued around 4,500 disaster-affected individuals so far.</p>

<p>While those injured are receiving free treatment, food and other emergency relief materials have been provided to others affected by the floods.</p>

<p>Hundreds of people are facing a shortage of food, safe drinking water and sanitation in Kathmandu following the natural disaster, according to eyewitnesses.</p>

<p>Market prices have also soared as vegetables coming from India and other districts of the country have been temporarily halted due to obstruction in major highways due to landslides.</p>

<p>Numerous roads throughout the nation are severely damaged, and all routes leading to the capital city, Kathmandu, are still blocked, leaving thousands of travellers stranded, The Kathmandu Post newspaper reported.</p>

<p>Home Ministry Spokesperson Rishiram Tiwari said efforts are underway to clear the obstructed highways to resume transportation.</p>

<p>At least 20 hydropower plants with a combined capacity of 1100 MW suffered damages due to floods and landslides triggered by the incessant rainfall in the past three days, which has led to the disruption in power supply in Kathmandu and other major cities.</p>

<p>"Heavy rains since Friday have caused widespread flooding across Kathmandu Valley, and across Nepal. This is the worst flooding experienced in recent years," said Jagan Chapagain, the Chief Executive Officer and Secretary General of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, in a post on X.</p>

<p>"In response to the crisis, local branches of the @NepalRedCross are working closely with authorities and (the) Emergency Operations Centre of Nepal Red Cross to coordinate rescue and relief operations," he added. Kathmandu's main river, the Bagmati, was flowing above danger levels after incessant rain lashed large swathes of eastern and central Nepal on Friday and Saturday, a report published by the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD) said.</p>

<p>"A low-pressure system in the Bay of Bengal and the more northerly than usual position of the monsoon trough was the reason" behind the exceptionally intense rain, it said on Saturday.</p>

<p>Scientists say that while climate change is changing the amount and timing of rainfall across Asia, a key reason for the rise in the impact of floods is the built environment, including unplanned construction, especially on floodplains, which leaves insufficient areas for water retention and drainage.</p>

<p>The floods and landslides have thrown life out of gear in many parts of the country, with many highways and road stretches disrupted, hundreds of houses and bridges buried or swept away, and hundreds of families displaced.</p>

<p>Thousands of passengers have been stranded in various places due to road disruption.</p>

<p>During the all-party meeting, it was also decided that the Ministry of Health and Population will conduct awareness programmes and other initiatives in potential and suitable locations to prevent the spread of diseases, as epidemics can spread after such disasters.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dramatic video footage released by Pinellas County officials shows a Tesla bursting into flames inside a Florida garage flooded by Hurricane Helene. The shocking incident serves as a warning to electric vehicle owners in areas affected by the storm. Surveillance footage reveals the fire starting underneath the car and spreading rapidly, fully engulfing it in under a minute. Thick smoke quickly fills the cluttered garage.</p>

<p>The warning comes after Hurricane Helene brought widespread flooding to parts of Florida, North Carolina, and other southeastern states. Pinellas County Government posted the surveillance video to Facebook on Saturday to warn electric vehicle owners of the risk.</p>

<p>''Electric Vehicles that have been flooded in saltwater can catch fire.&nbsp;If you evacuated and left an electric vehicle or golf cart in your garage or under a building and you are not able to get to it or move it, we want you to let us know,'' the county said in a Facebook post.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Officials also urged electric car owners to take precautions to prevent similar incidents. Pinellas county advised people not to charge, drive, or store their EVs or E-bikes in their homes or garages. They added that the electric vehicle should be moved 50 feet away from combustible material and towed to a dealership for inspection.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hurricane Helene made landfall in Florida's Big Bend region late Thursday as a Category 4 storm, bringing 140 mph winds and widespread devastation. As it swept through Georgia, the Carolinas, and Tennessee, Helene uprooted trees. splintered homes, caused creeks and rivers to overflow, spawned tornadoes and strained dams.&nbsp;The powerful hurricane left at least 93 people dead and left millions without power, as per<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/09/29/us-news/shocking-video-shows-entire-bridge-washed-away-by-hurricane-helen-floodwater/" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em> </em></a><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/09/29/us-news/tesla-erupts-into-flames-inside-flooded-fla-garage-following-hurricane-helene-video/"><em>New York Post.&nbsp;</em></a></p>

<p>President Joe Biden is planning to visit areas affected by Hurricane Helene this week, but only if it doesn't hinder ongoing rescue and recovery efforts. He assured that his administration is providing all available resources to support the affected states in their response. The American Red Cross has launched a massive relief effort, deploying over 1,400 disaster workers and opening hundreds of shelters for those affected.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Google re-hired its long-time researcher, Noam Shazeer, to co-lead its AI models in a $2.7 billion deal, the Wall Street Journal reported. Mr Shazeer quit Google in 2021 after being a part of the company for 21 years.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He reportedly quit when the company refused to launch a chatbot head had built along with a colleague. He went on to head the Character. AI.</p>

<p>He was a co-author of a seminal 2017 research paper which catalyzed the current AI boom. Character.AI utilizes the technical advancements pioneered in the paper. It has raised $193 million and was valued at $1 billion last year by venture capitalists.</p>

<p>Character.AI reached a valuation of $1 Billion last year. Google paid $2.7 Billion to Character.AI for a transfer of technology and bringing back Mr Shazeer to Google, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/noam-shazeer-google-ai-deal-d3605697" rel="no follow, no index">the report said</a>.</p>

<p>AI-boom has prompted startups to release new features to their chatbots as competitors such as Microsoft-backed OpenAI, Google and Amazon-backed Anthropic are looking to gain market share by engaging new users.</p>

<p>Last year, Google was in talks to invest hundreds of millions of dollars in Character.AI, but chose to bring him back.</p>

<p>The deal, which resembles similar moves by Amazon and Microsoft to nab top talent from AI startups, comes at a time when the Big Tech companies are facing regulatory scrutiny.</p>

<p>Shazeer is serving as a technical lead on Gemini - Google's AI chatbot - joining the other co-leaders Jeff Dean and Oriol Vinyals. Gemini is the line of AI models being developed by DeepMind, Google's AI division, and which are being integrated into products such as Search and Pixel smartphones.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="theconversation-article-title"><span style="font-size: 13px;">We all admire wise people, don't we? Whether it's a thoughtful teacher, a compassionate doctor, or an elder in the community, we recognise wisdom when we see it. But have you ever thought about how people in different cultures perceive wisdom? Does someone in Morocco view a wise person in the same way as someone in Ecuador? Our recent </span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50294-0" style="font-size: 13px;">study</a><span style="font-size: 13px;"> explored how people across cultures think of wisdom.</span></p>

<div class="theconversation-article-body">
<p>This large-scale project required a joint effort of 34 researchers across fields of philosophy, psychology, anthropology, social science and psychometrics – and from all over the world, connected in a research consortium called <a href="https://www.geographyofphilosophy.com/">The Geography of Philosophy</a>.</p>

<p>What we found was somewhat surprising. Wisdom may appear to be shaped by cultural differences, but the core aspects of what makes someone wise are largely the same across cultures. From urban college students in Japan to villagers in South Africa, participants associated wisdom with two key characteristics: reflective orientation and socio-emotional awareness. We explain what that means below.</p>

<p>Contrary to widespread stereotypes, people recognise the wisdom in a similar way across East and West, South and North. Despite the divisions of the world, we see wisdom in the same individuals and associate it with similar traits. Are we indeed more alike than we are different when it comes to how we perceive wisdom? And what characterises wise people?</p>

<h3><strong>These are the characteristics of wise people</strong></h3>

<p>There are two key characteristics. Reflective orientation is about people who think before acting, carefully consider different perspectives, and use logic and past experiences to guide their decisions. They're the type of person who keeps their cool in difficult situations, taking time to weigh all the options before making a move.</p>

<p>The second is socio-emotional awareness. Wise people are good at understanding and caring about the thoughts and feelings of others. They pay attention to emotions and consider different views on the situation. Such an individual might be skilled at mediating conflicts by understanding each party's point of view, or be adept at providing emotional support during difficult times.</p>

<p>Together, these two dimensions combine to form the global image of wisdom. The study suggests that the wisest people are those who balance both, showing strong abilities in reasoning while also being emotionally and socially aware.</p>

<p>A highly reflective person who is suppressing their own emotions but doesn't notice the social context of the problem wouldn't be called wise. Likewise, someone who is entirely driven by emotion and the social environment but fails to make logical connections wouldn't be called wise either. Real wisdom, according to our study, is about finding a balance between thoughtful reasoning, social understanding, and emotional awareness.</p>

<h3><strong>Cultures do differ, but not as much as you might think</strong></h3>

<p>To uncover these dimensions, we employed a method sometimes called <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/09/magazine/09wwln-idealab-t.html">experimental philosophy</a>. Participants across 16 different cultures in 12 countries on five continents compared a set of targets to each other. For example, one of the questions asked participants to compare whether a doctor or a religious person was more likely to think logically when making a hard life decision with no right or wrong answers. Our participants also rated themselves. Then we asked how wise each of these persons were.</p>

<p>When we started this project, we expected to find big differences between cultures. <a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/The-Geography-of-Thought/Richard-Nisbett/9780743255356">Previous research</a> suggested that people in “the West” use and value analytical thinking, which tends to dismiss social and emotional parts of the situation. In contrast, individuals in “the East” emphasise holistic thinking, that is, all-encompassing views of complex situations.</p>

<p>But that's not what we found. While there were some small differences – people in South Africa, for example, placed more importance on nature and divinity when thinking about socio-emotional awareness – the overall picture was strikingly similar. Across the globe, people rated individuals who were both reflective and socially and emotionally aware as the wisest. For instance, they named a doctor and a 75-year-old person as the wisest, and at the same time the highest on both dimensions.</p>

<p>What was particularly fascinating was that people tended to rate themselves differently from how they rated others. Most people saw themselves as less reflective but more socially and emotionally aware than the “wise” figures they were asked to rate. In other words, people were ready to admit a moderate level of their own intellectual capabilities, but they were quite confident in their ability to understand and care for others.</p>

<h3><strong>Why this matters</strong></h3>

<p>This research defies stereotypes of a cold analytical ideal of “the west” and a social-minded and emotionally driven image of “the east” and “the south”. The idea that wisdom is purely intellectual, or conversely, purely social or divine, is too simplistic. It also highlights that wisdom manifests in a balance of traits traditionally attributed to different cultures.</p>

<p>In a time when global cooperation is more important than ever, recognising our shared appreciation for certain qualities can help bridge cultural divides.</p>

<p>The study opens up new avenues for research. Could these dimensions of wisdom help us understand how to solve global problems? Are people more likely to trust leaders who show both reflective thinking and socio-emotional awareness? And how do these qualities affect the way we handle personal relationships, difficult decisions, or conflicts?</p>

<p>One thing is clear: wisdom is something we all value, no matter where we come from. By understanding it better, we can not only become wiser ourselves but also learn to appreciate wisdom in others, wherever they may be.<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.

       <description><![CDATA[Kris Kristofferson, who became one of the most influential American singer-songwriters of his time with works such as "Me and Bobby McGee," as well as becoming a successful actor, died Saturday at the age of 88, according to a family statement.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kris Kristofferson, who became one of the most influential American singer-songwriters of his time with works such as "Me and Bobby McGee," as well as becoming a successful actor, died Saturday at the age of 88, according to a family statement.</p>

<p>Kristofferson had been suffering from memory loss since he was in his 70s. A family spokesperson said in a statement that Kristofferson died peacefully at his home in Maui, Hawaii, surrounded by family, but a cause of death was not listed.</p>

<p>Kristofferson was a Renaissance man - an athlete with a poet's sensibilities, a former Army officer and helicopter pilot, and a Rhodes scholar who took a job as a janitor in what turned out to be a brilliant career move.</p>

<p>Kristofferson first established himself in the music world as a songwriter in the country music capital of Nashville - writing hits such as the Grammy-winning "Help Me Make It Through the Night," "For the Good Times," and one-time girlfriend Janis Joplin's plaintive No. 1 hit, "Me and Bobby McGee."</p>

<p>In the early 1970s, he became well-known as a performer with a rumbling, unpolished baritone, as well as an in-demand actor, notably opposite Barbra Streisand in "A Star Is Born," one of the most popular films of 1976.</p>

<p>Kristofferson was born in Brownsville, Texas, on June 22, 1936, and moved frequently because his father was a general in the Air Force. After graduating from Pomona College in California, where he played football and rugby, Kristofferson attended Oxford University on a Rhodes scholarship and then fulfilled the family tradition by joining the Army.</p>

<p>He went through the Army's elite Ranger School, learned to pilot helicopters and reached the rank of captain. In 1965 Kristofferson was offered a position teaching English - he was enthralled by the works of poet William Blake - at the U.S. Military Academy in West Point, New York, but he turned it down in order to head to Nashville.</p>

<p>Kristofferson became a janitor at the Columbia Records studio because it would give him a chance to offer his songs to the big-name stars recording there. He also worked as a helicopter pilot ferrying workers between Louisiana oilfields and offshore drilling rigs.</p>

<p>During that time Kristofferson wrote some of his most memorable songs, including "Help Me Make It Through the Night," which he said he penned atop an oil platform.</p>

<p>His most audacious song pitch came when he landed his helicopter on Johnny Cash's lawn - although he denied Cash's version of him climbing out of the cockpit with an audio tape in one hand and a beer in the other. Cash would later have a No. 1 hit with Kristofferson's "Sunday Morning Comin' Down" lament.</p>

<h3><strong>"NOTHING LEFT TO LOSE"</strong></h3>

<p>Kristofferson's best songs were filled with seekers, wastrels and broken souls trying to find love, redemption or relief from the hangover that life had given them. The broken-hearted narrator of "Bobby McGee," a song Kristofferson said was inspired by the Federico Fellini film "La Strada," summed it up with the line, "Freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose."</p>

<p>"Kris brought (country music) kind of from the dark ages up to the present-day time, made it acceptable and brought great lyrics - I mean, the best possible lyrics," Willie Nelson, an early role model for Kristofferson, told CBS's "60 Minutes" in a 1999 interview. "Simple but profound."</p>

<p>Kristofferson recorded four albums with Rita Coolidge, the second of his three wives, in the 1970s and joined Nelson, Cash and Waylon Jennings in the country music supergroup the Highwaymen in the 1980s and '90s.</p>

<p>Kristofferson's rugged good looks led to roles in movies such as "Cisco Pike," "Pat Garrett &amp; Billy the Kid," "The Sailor Who Fell from Grace with the Sea," "Convoy," "Heaven's Gate," "Lone Star" and "Blade."</p>

<p>Kristofferson lived hard during his heyday. There was a long line of girlfriends and performances he could not remember because he was drunk. He gave up drinking - but not marijuana - when a doctor told him he was killing himself.</p>

<p>"It was fun," Kristofferson told "60 Minutes." "It was the way that I thought an artist was supposed to live. I always agreed with Blake when he said that the road of excess leads to the palace of wisdom. ... I think God protects fools and songwriters."</p>

<p>After his initial stardom, Kristofferson took on causes such as the United Farm Workers and spoke out against US government involvement in Nicaragua and El Salvador in the 1980s.</p>

<p>Kristofferson began experiencing debilitating memory loss in his mid-70s and his performances suffered for it. Doctors told him it appeared to be the onset of Alzheimer's disease or dementia, possibly brought on by blows to the head while boxing and playing football and rugby in his younger days.</p>

<p>But in 2016, his wife, Lisa, told Rolling Stone magazine that Kristofferson had been diagnosed with Lyme disease, which can cause memory problems, and that after treatment and stopping Alzheimer's medication, his memory began to return partially.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump's running mate JD Vance and Kamala Harris's vice-presidential pick Tim Walz -- set to debate each other Tuesday -- embody different versions of masculinity in an election that is dividing American men and women like never before.</p>

<p>Vance, on the Republican ticket, has a conservative definition of family.</p>

<p>The Ohio senator has been criticized for denouncing "childless cat ladies" who have no "direct interest" in the welfare of the country, he alleged, because they have no children.</p>

<p>As a former soldier from a lower-class family, Vance sees himself as the spokesman for the downtrodden Americans with whom he grew up.</p>

<p>Stringently opposed to abortion, Vance also criticizes progressive ideas of family which, in his view, encourage "people to shift spouses like they change their underwear."</p>

<p>On the other side, Democrat Tim Walz strives to project a different image of the good family man -- one who does not hesitate to show a more vulnerable side of himself, like when discussing the fertility problems he faced with his wife Gwen.</p>

<p>"I can remember praying each night for a phone call," he recounted at the Democratic National Convention.</p>

<p>"The pit in your stomach when the phone would ring, and the absolute agony when we heard the treatments hadn't worked."</p>

<p>The Minnesota governor, a former teacher, also frequently retells the story of how he helped create the first LGBTQ student club at the high school where he taught, long before gay rights were widely socially accepted.</p>

<h3><strong>'Toxic masculinity' alternatives&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Walz, who also coached high school football and served 24 years in the National Guard, still plays into a classic male archetype, whether he is discussing his favourite hardware store on TikTok or boasting about his hunting skills.</p>

<p>In reference to Vance, for instance, Walz said: "I guarantee you he can't shoot pheasants like I can."</p>

<p>"The Harris campaign is offering alternatives to the 'toxic masculinity' that has captured the Republican party," said Karrin Vasby Anderson, a communications studies professor at Colorado State University.</p>

<p>And Walz isn't alone, she added.</p>

<p>Harris's husband, Doug Emhoff, enthusiastically supports his wife and has no problem making himself the butt of the joke, including when he describes the awkward voicemail he left her after their first date.</p>

<p>The posturing is a far cry from Donald Trump's "macho man" stance -- one that he references by playing the Village People hit of the same name to open his rallies.</p>

<p>Anderson argues that societal gains by women and people of colour have "required white men to make adjustments to how they speak, what jokes they tell, how they comport themselves in romantic relationships, how they conduct themselves at work."</p>

<p>"Some men don't like having to change," she added.</p>

<h3><strong>Gender divide&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>According to recent polls, a growing number of young men are throwing their support behind Trump, whose rhetoric centres on strength, authority and even violence.</p>

<p>The Republican is capitalizing on this well of support by increasing the number of events he holds with influencers involved in cryptocurrency, video games and combat sports, many of whom have followings in the tens of millions.</p>

<p>In the extremely close race for the White House, Trump hopes to motivate an electorate that historically has not had a strong turnout at the polls.</p>

<p>Harris, on the other hand, often says that "the true measure of strength is based on who you lift up, not who you beat down."</p>

<p>The Democrat, who fiercely defends abortion rights, is banking on mobilizing women, who vote in greater numbers than men in the United States.</p>

<p>The 2020 election saw 82.2 million women go to the polls, compared with 72.5 million men, according to the Center for American Women and Politics.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The main defendant in a mass rape trial that has sparked horror and protests in France was absent on Monday because he is "unwell" and must undergo medical treatment, the presiding judge said.</p>

<p>Dominique Pelicot, 71, has been on trial since September 2 over raping and recruiting strangers to rape his heavily sedated wife Gisele for nearly a decade.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The trial had already been briefly suspended in mid-September due to the absence of Dominique Pelicot, who was suffering from intestinal problems.</p>

<p>"He's unwell. He has to have medical treatment this afternoon," Judge Roger Arata said at the start of the hearing on Monday in the southeastern city of Avignon. "We'll see tomorrow," he added.</p>

<p>Dominique Pelicot had already been excused from the hearing on Friday to undergo a medical examination.&nbsp;</p>

<p>His lawyer Beatrice Zavarro had told AFP on Sunday that the examination "went well."</p>

<p>Pelicot has admitted to the charges against him.</p>

<p>He is being tried along with 50 other men aged between 26 and 74, many of whom have denied the rape charge. Most risk up to 20 years in jail if convicted of aggravated rape.</p>

<p>Seven more defendants will be called to testify on Thursday.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Among them is 46-year-old Jerome V., a former grocery store employee, who sexually assaulted Gisele Pelicot six times in 2020 at the couple's home in the town of Mazan in southeastern France.</p>

<p>Gisele Pelicot, Dominique's ex-wife who only discovered the abuse in 2020 after being told of it by police, has requested that the trial be open to the public to raise awareness about the use of drugs to commit sexual abuse.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Incoming NATO chief Mark Rutte brings new leadership this week to one of the world's most powerful-sounding roles -- helming the nuclear-armed Atlantic alliance.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Incoming NATO chief Mark Rutte brings new leadership this week to one of the world's most powerful-sounding roles -- helming the nuclear-armed Atlantic alliance.</p>

<p>But even if the former Dutch prime minister wanted to shake things up after taking over from Jens Stoltenberg, he probably couldn't.</p>

<p>The reality of the NATO job means Rutte will be heading a risk-averse civilian bureaucracy, with hard power ultimately residing with member countries and above all the United States.</p>

<p>And in many ways NATO's 32 nations -- by swapping one mild-mannered, middle-aged, northern European male ex-premier for another -- have opted for more of the same, to steer the alliance in troubled times.</p>

<p>"In such a difficult geopolitical situation, keeping continuation and the same foreign policy and security line is very important," a senior NATO diplomat told AFP, talking on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.</p>

<p>During his more than 10 years at the helm, Stoltenberg won plaudits for his calm stewardship of the sometimes fractious alliance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Norwegian helped keep then-US president Donald Trump on board, threw his weight behind Ukraine while making sure NATO didn't get dragged into a war with Russia and kicked off an overhaul of the alliance's defences to face Moscow.</p>

<p>"Allies were looking for somebody who has many of the same qualities as Stoltenberg and will continue in the same direction: prime minister, well-connected, long experience, good address book, has handled Trump," said Jamie Shea, a former senior NATO official now with the Chatham House think tank.</p>

<p>Rutte, a favourite of key powers the US, Britain, France and Germany, ticked all those boxes.</p>

<p>A veteran who led complex coalitions in the Netherlands for 13 years, he has ample experience that can be put to use keeping countries with disparate -- and often competing -- interests on the same page.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"He is a consensus builder with an unflinching commitment to the transatlantic alliance," a senior US official said.</p>

<p>The Dutchman has been a stalwart backer of Kyiv and wasn't afraid to talk frankly to Trump, who could make a comeback after elections in November.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Consensus straitjacket?</strong></h3>

<p>Similarities aside, diplomats say the straight-talking Rutte should bring a breath of fresh air to the alliance after Stoltenberg's long tenure.</p>

<p>But Rutte would likely struggle to get through major changes.</p>

<p>While the job of running the alliance sounds like a potent role, the secretary general actually only heads the civilian bureaucracy of some 1,500 staff.</p>

<p>Military power rests with the member countries -- mainly in the hands of an American general as Supreme Allied Commander in Europe.</p>

<p>The NATO head often serves more as a spokesperson-in-chief for the organisation, with Stoltenberg known for carefully parsing the position he could stake out.</p>

<p>All decisions at NATO need to be agreed by each member and the person at the top is constrained by how far allies -- and particularly Washington -- are willing to go.</p>

<p>The direction for the next year was set at the last summit in Washington in July.</p>

<p>"NATO is a consensus organisation. Everything, absolutely everything, from the most mundane to the most strategic, is decided by consensus," said Ian Lesser of the German Marshall Fund think tank.</p>

<p>"So the scope for individual secretary generals to reshape what NATO does and how it does it is obviously very limited."&nbsp;</p>

<p>That said, Rutte does have some levers at his disposal to try to drive through priorities.</p>

<p>"The secretary-general can be instrumental in bringing issues to the agenda for discussion," Lesser said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"That's actually a big role."</p>

<p>Stoltenberg used his pulpit to press allies on supporting Ukraine, paying more attention to the impact of climate change or strengthening ties with partners in Asia-Pacific.</p>

<p>Diplomats say one area where Rutte could push is trying to improve coordination between the European Union and NATO -- long hamstrung by alliance member Turkey's standoff with Cyprus.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But Rutte's main chance to shape the office will likely come if the political situation gets stormier -- with Trump's return to office or a major change in Ukraine.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Then he'll need all his diplomatic guile -- and lengthy contact list -- to keep the ears and commitment of NATO's diverse leaders.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The skill and personality of a secretary general can make a difference, especially under conditions when the alliance is being tested," Lesser said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Global investment firm Fidelity has reduce the value of its holding in Elon Musk-run X (formerly Twitter) by a massive 78.7 per cent, which implies that the X social media platform is likely valued at just $9.4 billion.</p>

<p>The tech billionaire had bought the social media company for $44 billion in October 2022 after an intense drama.</p>

<p>As per new estimate from asset manager Fidelity, X is now valued at less than a quarter of its $44 billion purchase price (at August end), reports TechCrunch, citing its filings.</p>

<p>The fund now values its stake in X at approximately $4.18 million. In July, Fidelity valued its shares in X at about $5.5 million.</p>

<p>X, Fidelity or Musk did not immediately comment on the report based on regulatory disclosures.</p>

<p>In May, Musk-run artificial intelligence (AI) company xAI raised $6 billion to accelerate the research and development of future technologies. In a post, the X owner said the pre-money valuation was $18 billion.</p>

<p>xAI, which has unveiled an AI chatbot called 'Grok', raised funds from key investors, including Fidelity Management and Research.</p>

<p>In January this year, the global investment firm Fidelity marked down its investment in Musk-run X Holdings (the parent company of X) by a whopping 71.5 per cent from the original value.</p>

<p>Fidelity took a stake in X Corp for $300 million in October 2022 when Musk acquired the platform, formerly called Twitter, for $44 billion.</p>

<p>In 2023, Fidelity had cut the valuation by 65 per cent, and now, it has further cut X's valuation in a new disclosure.</p>

<p>Musk had reportedly told bankers, after taking $13 billion in loan to fund his Twitter acquisition, that they will not lose any money on the deal. The debt is split between $6.5 billion of term loans, as well as $6 billion of senior and junior bonds and a $500 million revolver. Lenders were unlikely to get even 60 cents on the dollar for the bonds and loans.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday vowed that Moscow would accomplish all goals it has set for itself in Ukraine, in its third year of conflict.</p>

<p>"The truth is on our side. All goals set will be achieved," Putin said in a video message released to mark the second anniversary of what Russia calls "Reunification Day" when Moscow annexed four Ukrainian regions.</p>

<p>After it sent troops into Ukraine in February 2022, Russia annexed the regions of Lugansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson. It does not fully control all territory in these regions.</p>

<p>In his address, Putin repeated his justification for sending troops into Ukraine as protecting Russian speakers against a "neo-Nazi dictatorship" that aimed to "cut them off forever from Russia, their historic homeland".</p>

<p>He also slammed "Western elites" who "turned Ukraine into their colony, a military base aimed at Russia" and who fanned "hate, radical nationalism... hostility to everything Russian".</p>

<p>"Today we are fighting for a secure, prosperous future for our children and grandchildren", he said.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Palestinian militant group Hamas said its leader in Lebanon was killed Monday in a strike on the country's south, as official media reported a strike on a Palestinian refugee camp.</p>

<p>"Fatah Sharif Abu al-Amine, the leader of Hamas... in Lebanon and member of the movement's leadership abroad" was killed in an air strike on his "home in the Al-Bass camp in south Lebanon", a Hamas statement said.</p>

<p>It said he was killed with his wife, son and daughter in a "terrorist and criminal assassination".</p>

<p>The official National News Agency reported an air strike on Al-Bass near the city of Tyre, saying it was the "first time" the camp had been targeted.</p>

<p>The statement came hours after the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), a secular left-wing group, said three of its members were killed in a strike in Beirut's Kola district early Monday.</p>

<p>Israel has repeatedly targeted Hamas officials in Lebanon since the Gaza war erupted almost a year ago.</p>

<p>A strike in January, which a US defence official said was carried out by Israel, killed Hamas deputy leader Saleh al-Aruri and six other militants in Hezbollah's south Beirut stronghold.</p>

<p>In August, an Israeli strike on a vehicle in the south Lebanon city of Sidon killed Hamas commander Samer al-Hajj.</p>

<p>Lebanon's official Palestinian refugee camps were created for Palestinians who were driven out or fled during the 1948 war at the time of Israel's creation.</p>

<p>By longstanding convention, the Lebanese army stays out of the camps and leaves the Palestinian factions to handle security.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Iran's ultra-hardliners are demanding the closure of the Strait of Hormuz and the development of a nuclear bomb in response to the recent killing of Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The hardliners in Iran are calling for drastic measures in response to Israel's recent killing of Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah. Dominated by supporters of ultra-hardliner figures such as former nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili, there's been a growing chorus on social media for Iran to adopt a more aggressive stance, including blocking the vital Strait of Hormuz and pursuing nuclear weapon development.<br />
<br />
In recent posts, ultra-hardliners have voiced frustration with President Masoud Pezeshkian's government, accusing it of being too passive in the face of Israel's military operations in Gaza and Lebanon. However, according to the report, these criticisms largely omit the fact that any decision regarding military action against Israel lies with Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, who holds ultimate authority as the head of Iran's Armed Forces.<br />
<br />
Following Nasrallah's death, Khamenei, through a number of posts on X (formerly Twitter), urged “all Muslims to stand with the people of Lebanon and the honorable Hezbollah” but refrained from any direct call for retaliation, falling short of the revenge many hardliners had anticipated.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>In the absence of such a directive, Jalili's followers have begun advocating for radical actions, according to Iran International.<br />
<br />
Comparisons to Yemen's control of the Bab al-Mandab Strait, another critical oil shipping route, have been drawn by these factions, with some questioning why Iran hasn't similarly closed the Hormuz to Western vessels.<br />
<br />
One social media post, when translated to English, read, “Why can Yemen block the main passageway of oil [in the Bab al-Mandab Strait], but we are not doing the same in the Strait of Hormuz?”</p>

<p>The escalating rhetoric from Iran's ultra-hardline camp suggests that blocking the Strait, which handles a significant percentage of the world's oil shipments, would serve as a warning to Israel and its Western allies, said the Iran International report, adding, this action could, however, also trigger a military confrontation with the US and other naval powers in the region.<br />
<br />
Alongside these demands, a growing number of voices within Iran's hardline factions are advocating for the development of a nuclear weapon. Sohrab Salehi, a university professor, wrote on X, “Iran burned its cards in the past. Now the only available card is Atom Bomb. This is the only way to bring the West to negotiations.”</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="rtl" lang="fa">خوشمان بیاید یا نه، ایران باید دکترین نظامی خود را به سمت ساخت بمب اتم هدایت کند. ایران کارت های خود را در گذشته، سوزانده. اکنون تنها کارت قابل دسترس، بمب اتم است. این تنها راهی است که غرب را به سمت مذاکره می کشاند.</p>

<p>Not everyone, though, agrees with these suggestions. Many argue that closing the Strait of Hormuz would not only escalate tensions but could also backfire on Iran economically and diplomatically. Additionally, despite some calls for nuclear weapon development, there remains the issue of Khamenei's reported religious edict against weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear arms.<br />
<br />
These tensions are playing out against the backdrop of a broader reassessment within Iran's political circles regarding the fallout from Israel's recent military actions. Abdolreza Davari, a former ally of ex-President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, has been one of the more prominent voices calling for a more pragmatic approach. Davari, who supported President Pezeshkian in the last election, tweeted that the operation that killed Nasrallah was an “irreparable blow to the body of the resistance front.”</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Davari also suggested that Iran focus more on protecting its own national interests, taking into account the evolving geopolitical landscape in the post-Nasrallah era.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[At least six people have died in Rwanda's first-ever outbreak of the deadly Marburg virus. Sabin Nsanzimana, the country's health minister, confirmed that most of the victims were healthcare workers in a hospital intensive care unit.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At least six people have died in Rwanda's first-ever outbreak of the deadly Marburg virus. Sabin Nsanzimana, the country's health minister, <a href="https://africa.cgtn.com/six-dead-as-rwanda-battles-marburg-virus-outbreak/ ">confirmed</a> that most of the victims were healthcare workers in a hospital intensive care unit.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Twenty-six cases have been confirmed since Friday. Authorities are tracking around 300 people who may have been exposed to the virus, mostly in the capital city, Kigali. To curb its spread, the government is implementing measures such as contact tracing, quarantining affected individuals and launching public health awareness campaigns.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<strong>What is the Marburg Virus?</strong></p>

<p>The Marburg virus is a highly infectious disease similar to Ebola. According to the World Health Organisation, the disease has a high fatality rate, ranging from 24 per cent to 88 per cent, depending on the outbreak and the healthcare response.</p>

<p>The virus was first identified in 1967. This outbreak, linked to African green monkeys imported from Uganda, occurred simultaneously in Marburg and Frankfurt in Germany and Belgrade in Serbia, leading to 31 infections and seven deaths at the time.<br />
<br />
<strong>How the virus spreads</strong></p>

<p>The primary carrier of the Marburg virus is the Egyptian rousette fruit bat, which can transmit the virus to humans. African green monkeys and pigs can also carry the virus.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The virus spreads between humans through contact with:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Bodily fluids (blood, saliva, vomit, etc)</li>
	<li>Contaminated bedding or surfaces</li>
	<li>Infected semen, which can remain infectious months after recovery</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Symptoms</strong><br />
<br />
Symptoms can start suddenly and include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>High fever</li>
	<li>Severe headaches</li>
	<li>Muscle pains</li>
</ul>

<p>After about three days, patients report severe symptoms such as:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Watery diarrhoea</li>
	<li>Stomach pain</li>
	<li>Vomiting</li>
	<li>Bleeding from various parts of the body</li>
</ul>

<p>According to the WHO, “The appearance of patients at this phase has been described as showing 'ghost-like' drawn features, deep-set eyes, expressionless faces and extreme lethargy.”<br />
<br />
Extreme blood loss and shock can result in death within eight to nine days after symptoms appear.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<strong>Current control measures</strong><br />
<br />
Health authorities recommend:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Avoiding physical contact with the infected people</li>
	<li>Washing hands regularly with soap and water or using sanitiser</li>
	<li>Avoiding consumption of bushmeat or contact with pigs in outbreak areas</li>
</ul>

<p>The WHO is providing support to Rwanda in managing the outbreak. There are currently no specific treatments or vaccines, although supportive care, including fluid replacement and blood transfusions, may help manage symptoms. Researchers are developing various blood products, drug therapies, and immune treatments.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>More than 13,000 immigrants, convicted of homicide either in the United States or abroad, are currently living freely in America, according to the country's Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). These individuals are not in ICE detention but part of the agency's “non-detained” docket, meaning they are known to ICE but are not currently prioritised for detention or cannot be located.</p>

<p>The revelation was made in response to a request from Republican Congressman Tony Gonzales of Texas in March, with the statistics collected as of July 21. Acting ICE Director P.J. Lechleitner provided the information as part of his response.</p>

<p>Sharing the information on X (formerly Twitter), Gonzales wrote, “As of July 21, 2024, there were 662,566 noncitizens with criminal histories on ICE's national docket—13,099 criminally convicted MURDERS! Americans deserve to be SAFE in our communities.”</p>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>The timeline of when the first of the 13,000 individuals entered the US remains unclear. Two law enforcement officials with knowledge of the data explained that many of the immigrants, including those convicted of serious crimes, entered the country under previous administrations, including that of former President Donald Trump. These individuals are now awaiting immigration hearings but remain at large in the country, reported <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/investigations/13000-immigrants-convicted-homicide-living-freely-us-ice-data-rcna173125">NBC News</a>.</p>

<p>On Friday, during a campaign event in Michigan, the Republican nominee used the figures to criticise the Joe Biden administration's immigration policies, specifically calling out Vice President Kamala Harris. “These are hard, tough, vicious criminals that are free to roam in our country,” Trump said, adding, “I can finally look at them and say ‘I told you so,' to the fake news.”</p>

<p>While the White House has yet to respond to the numbers, one official noted the administration was caught off-guard by the timing of the disclosure. The figures shed light on the complex and often fragmented immigration enforcement system, where federal, state, and local authorities sometimes fail to coordinate effectively.</p>

<p>The NBC News report said that according to law enforcement sources, some of these individuals may have crossed the border and been released because the US Border Patrol lacked information on their criminal histories at the time. In many cases, the US is only notified of an immigrant's criminal conviction after they enter the country. Furthermore, migrants who have completed their prison sentences may be released by local or state authorities without ICE being informed, particularly in sanctuary cities, making it more difficult for the agency to locate and detain them.</p>

<p>The law enforcement officials told NBC News that ICE prioritises arresting migrants convicted of serious crimes, such as homicide but they also highlighted that the agency's limited resources pose challenges in tracking down and arresting all those on the list. ICE currently has over 7.5 million immigrants on its “non-detained” docket, meaning they have pending immigration cases but are not in custody.</p>

<p>Lechleitner told NBC News that despite these challenges, there has been an increase in cooperation from local jurisdictions, with some re-evaluating their sanctuary city policies amid rising concerns over migrant crime.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Saudi Arabia expressed its "great concern" at the conflict in Lebanon on Monday, calling for the country's "sovereignty and territorial integrity" to be respected.</p>

<p>A foreign ministry statement said: "the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is following with great concern the developments taking place in the Republic of Lebanon."</p>

<p>As the country's health ministry said more than a hundred people had been killed in Israel's strikes on targets across the country on Sunday, Riyadh stressed the need to respect Lebanon's sovereignty.</p>

<p>"The Kingdom calls on the international community to assume its responsibilities towards protecting regional peace and security to spare the region and its people the dangers and tragedies of wars," it added.</p>

<p>Israel has carried out several days of deadly strikes on targets in Lebanon, killing the leader of the Iran-backed Hezbollah group Hassan Nasrallah on Friday and other senior figures in the movement.</p>

<p>There have been growing calls internationally for restraint from Israel as it prepares for a possible ground offensive against Hezbollah in Lebanon, amid fears of all-out war in the Middle East.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russia has lost 651,810 troops since the onset of its full-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces said. This figure, released on September 29, includes 1,170 Russian casualties recorded in just one day.</p>

<p>In addition to troop casualties, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/GeneralStaff.ua/posts/pfbid0r4aNSzquVq6yvzhBtrd9NJtQeifM6kKgeGXzCcgxKUGEtxqbRqLFXadSAVAZGGq8l">the report</a> said Russia lost 8,869 tanks, 17,476 armoured fighting vehicles, and 25,495 vehicles and fuel tanks.</p>

<p>Other significant losses include 18,795 artillery systems, 1,204 multiple launch rocket systems, 962 air defence systems, 369 aeroplanes, 328 helicopters, 16,186 drones, 28 ships and boats and one submarine.</p>

<p>On the same day, at least 16 people were reported wounded due to a series of Russian strikes on Zaporizhzhia in southern Ukraine. The regional capital experienced multiple “massive aerial strikes” early in the morning, destroying a multi-storey building and several houses. Among the wounded were two children aged eight and 17, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/30/ukraine-war-briefing-zaporizhzhia-attacks-injured-russia ">The Guardian</a> reported.</p>

<p>In the neighbouring Donetsk region, three killings and additional injuries were reported following Russian attacks on Pokrovsk, a city in the throes of the ongoing assault. Ukrainian emergency services said they were working to rescue those trapped under rubble.</p>

<p>Regional officials noted the extensive damage caused by the strikes, with Governor Ivan Fedorov confirming that one of the train stations in Zaporizhzhya was also hit.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Andriy Yermak, head of Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's office, condemned the attacks, accusing Russia of attempting to “terrorise” the civilian population. He reiterated calls for increased military support from Western allies, including advanced weaponry to intercept Russian missile strikes.</p>

<p>Denmark has pledged $194 million to support Ukraine's military, while Norway is considering border security measures.</p>

<p>Earlier, former US President <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/donald-trump-meets-ukraines-zelenskiy-vows-to-end-ukraine-war-quickly-6664967">Donald Trump met Ukrainian President</a> Volodymyr Zelensky at Trump Tower, stressing the need to end the war in Ukraine.

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Long Island man is facing murder charges after allegedly killing his friend during an altercation in the Hamptons early Saturday morning. Jeremy Allen, 43, was arrested after police discovered the body of Christopher Hahn, 43, hidden under a tarp on Allen's back patio.<br />
<br />
According to authorities, the two drunken men were discussing their plans for a 12-step recovery programme when their conversation turned heated. Prosecutors said Allen beat Hahn for approximately six hours before ultimately stabbing him in the head and neck with a large knife.<br />
<br />
Suffolk County prosecutor Elena Tomaro described the attack as “brutal and heinous to watch”. Allen's lawyer reported that the two men were “pounding down drinks” before the violent altercation. Allen has a history of drunk driving offences dating back to 2007, raising concerns about his conduct.<br />
<br />
After the attack, Allen texted a local handyman for cleanup assistance. However, the handyman discovered the bloodied body and instead contacted Southampton Town Police. Southampton Town Police responded to the scene shortly before 10 am, where Christopher Hahn was pronounced dead.<br />
<br />
Jeremy Allen was taken into custody about an hour later and was arraigned on Sunday, where he was ordered to be held without bail. He also has a pending rape case in Southampton and is currently on probation for a 2022 drunken driving conviction in Ulster County.<br />
<br />
This incident follows another case in Ohio where a 40-year-old man was charged with murder after <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-man-stabs-mother-to-death-after-being-denied-overnight-stay-at-family-home-6318691">fatally stabbing his mother</a> during a heated argument. The incident occurred in Green Township when Kenneth Mortimer's mother refused his request to stay overnight at their family home.<br />
<br />
The confrontation escalated, leading Mortimer to get a knife from the kitchen and attack both his parents. Despite his mother's attempts to flee and call for help, she succumbed to her injuries, while Mortimer's father remained in serious condition at a hospital. The man fled the scene but was later apprehended by police.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>K-pop star Suga, a member of the boy band supergroup BTS, has been fined 15 million won ($11,500) by a court for drunk driving while on an electric scooter. A judge at the Seoul Western District Court issued the fine in a summary judgment made last week after his case was referred to the prosecution, a court official said on Monday.</p>

<p>In August, the songwriter and rapper made an apology for the incident calling it "careless and wrong behaviour" with police also revoking his licence for riding the e-scooter while drunk.</p>

<p>Suga rode the scooter and tripped when parking at night, according to his label Big Hit Music, which is part of K-pop firm HYBE. The label also said he failed a breath test to measure his blood alcohol level conducted by police.</p>

<p>Since announcing a break from group projects in June 2022, BTS members pursued solo activities before starting military service.</p>

<p>The 31-year-old Suga has been engaged in social service work in order to meet his military duty commitment.</p>

<p>The drunk driving incident is the latest example of K-pop performers sometimes falling short of their squeaky-clean image.</p>

<p>The case prompted some BTS fans upset by his action to send flower wreaths near HYBE headquarters, with messages on boards asking him to leave the band.</p>

<p>Those notified of summary judgments can apply for a regular trial within seven days to challenge the decision.</p>

<p>Suga's label did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

The panel found that Ross Benson had been accused of hitting the child between April and August 2018, according to the Met Police.</p>

<p>The child was known to Benson, and the incidents, which occurred while he was off duty, were found to have a sexual element, the force added.</p>

<p>Following the disciplinary hearing, Benson was dismissed without notice and placed on the College of Policing's barred list, the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd6qgw97w92o" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>BBC </em></a>reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Benson had served in the North West Basic Command Unit in London.</p>

<p>In November 2020, Bedfordshire Police arrested Benson on suspicion of sexual assault, but by September 2021, he was informed that no further action would be taken. Bedfordshire Police then referred the case to the Met's Directorate of Professional Standards, which launched a misconduct investigation. The investigation concluded on Friday, finding that Benson had committed gross misconduct by breaching the professional standards expected of police officers.</p>

<p>Detective Superintendent Will Lexton-Jones told the media outlet: "My thoughts are with the victim, who showed great courage in coming forward. PC Benson's appalling behaviour has resulted in his immediate dismissal, a decision I fully support. I hope this outcome sends a clear message that we are committed to removing those who fail to uphold the high standards expected of our officers."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As jubilant Austrian far-right supporters celebrated their party's historic win in Sunday's national elections with beers, they knew forming a government would not be easy.</p>

<p>"It's a real success... (but) I predict that no matter who forms the government, we will certainly not have one before Christmas," Erik Berglund, a 35-year-old waiter, told AFP.</p>

<p>Led by sharp-tongued Herbert Kickl since 2021, the far-right Freedom Party (FPOe) had been tipped to narrowly beat the ruling conservatives but Sunday's results -- with the party getting around 29 per cent -- were even slightly better than expected.</p>

<p>Like other party supporters around him in traditional Austrian dress, Berglund credited Kickl as the "most competent leader".</p>

<p>But he said it would now be up to the other parties to decide if the FPOe head can become chancellor.</p>

<p>"It will certainly be a very, very exciting time," he added as electric blue light -- the FPOe colour -- illuminated the restaurant in downtown Vienna where the party was celebrating.</p>

<h3><strong>'Mountain climber'</strong></h3>

<p>Chancellor Karl Nehammer, whose conservatives came second in the elections, has already said he would not form a coalition government with Kickl. Other party leaders have also rejected him.</p>

<p>"I am a mountain climber, but the bag that I have been given is not light," the sporty Kickl told his cheering supporters.</p>

<p>As supporters watched the vote night unfold on private television rather than public broadcaster ORF, which the FPOe has accused of being biased, they booed whenever other parties' representatives appeared onscreen.</p>

<p>Hilmar Kabas, an FPOe member since the 1960s, said other parties' "weakness" was the main reason that propelled the far right to victory.</p>

<p>But supporters wearing "Team Kickl" parkas also rattle off other reasons, such as asylum seeker applications deemed too many, a slumping economy and the high cost of living that has seen far-right parties across Europe gain ground.</p>

<p>But if no one is willing to form a coalition under Kickl, it's better to stay in the opposition, Kabas said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"It is not the other parties that decide for us," he added.</p>

<h3><strong>'Beacon in our night'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>A loden-clothed activist from the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party was also among the crowd, having come specially from Bavaria state in neighbouring Germany to celebrate with his "friends".</p>

<p>"Germany is looking toward Vienna tonight," he said, declining to give his name.</p>

<p>With him, he brought a gift for Kickl: a small blue lighthouse engraved with his name because "he is a beacon in our night".</p>

<p>Outgoing lawmaker Petra Steger said President Alexander Van der Bellen must now give the mandate to Kickl to form a government "respecting the voters".</p>

<p>"That's how it works in a democracy," she said.</p>

<p>Having expressed reservations about Kickl a few months ago, Van der Bellen promised after the results were announced he would make sure a government is formed that respects the "foundations of our liberal democracy".</p>

<p>Not far from the FPOe celebration, in front of parliament, a few hundred people gathered to say "no to Kickl", leader of a party formed by former Nazis.</p>

<p>"Nazis out", they chanted.</p>

<p>"Unfortunately, it was to be expected that the FPOe would be in the lead, but it is quite sad (to have this result), because somehow we have learned nothing from history," Juliana Hofmann, a 19-year-old student, told AFP.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

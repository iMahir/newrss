       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From hitjobs to sabotages and cyberattacks, Israel has either been blamed for or has itself claimed a variety of attacks against Iran.</p>

<p>In Israel's sights are Iran's elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and Tehran's nuclear programme.</p>

<p>As Israel launched a series of air strikes Saturday, which it said were aimed at Iran's military infrastructure, AFP looks at the other attempts over the years.</p>

<h3><strong>Revolutionary Guard</strong></h3>

<p>Israel has been blamed for targeting top members of Iran's Revolutionary Guards, mostly in attempts outside their country's borders.</p>

<p>Latest victims include a general killed on September 27 by the side of Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah in an Israeli strike in the suburbs of Beirut.&nbsp;</p>

<p>An air strike blamed on Israel on Iran's consular annex building in Damascus on April 1, 2024 killed, according to Tehran, seven members of the Revolutionary Guards, including two of top rank.</p>

<p>The recent killings are only the latest in a long list.</p>

<p>In December 2023, a commander died in Syria in an attack blamed on Israel, a year after a colonel was killed, also in Syria.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In May 2022, Sayyad Khodaei, a member of the Quds Force, the unit in charge of the Guards' external operations, was gunned down by two motorcyclists on his way home in Tehran. According to the New York Times, Israel told the United States that it was responsible for the hitjob.&nbsp;</p>

<p>General Hassan Moghadam, responsible for armament programmes, was killed in an explosion at a munitions depot in November 2011 close to Tehran, in an operation blamed on the United States and Israel.</p>

<h3><strong>Iran's nuclear programme</strong></h3>

<p>Israel has also been accused of carrying out targeted assassinations against several high-ranking Iranian physicists, often linked to Tehran's nuclear programme.</p>

<p>Among them are nuclear physicist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, killed in November 2020 and presented after his death as a vice minister of defence.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Scientist Mostafa Ahmadi Roshan, who was working on the Natanz nuclear site, and Majid Shahriari, the founder of Iran's nuclear society, as well as particle physics professor Massoud Ali Mohammadi were others killed over the years.</p>

<p>Israel has also been accused of sabotaging Iranian nuclear installations, mainly the Natanz complex to the south of Tehran.</p>

<p>On April 11, 2021, the site saw a small explosion, according to Iran's atomic energy agency.</p>

<p>The New York Times reported that Israel played a part in the "strong blast" that apparently took out the internal electric system supplying uranium enrichment centrifuges.</p>

<p>Another "accident" also hit Natanz in July 2020, in what Iran's atomic agency had said was a "sabotage".</p>

<p>In September 2010, a cyberattack using the Stuxnet virus took out the enrichment centrifuges at Natanz.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Iran accused Israel and the United States, while information security experts also pointed the finger at Washington.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Iran's allies</strong></h3>

<p>Iran's allies too have found that Tehran is not always safe shelter.</p>

<p>Hamas political chief Ismail Haniyeh was killed on July 31 in Iran's capital in an attack blamed on Israel. He was in Tehran to attend the inauguration ceremony of Iran's new president Masoud Pezeshkian.</p>

<h3><strong>Iranian petrol</strong></h3>

<p>In March 2021, the Wall Street Journal, citing US and Middle East officials, reported that Israel had in 2019 targeted at least a dozen vessels travelling to Syria and in most cases, transporting Iranian petrol.</p>

<p>The report said Israel had deployed underwater mines in the assault.</p>

<p>Through 2021, Israel and Iran accused each other of naval sabotages.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The skeletal remains of the man, believed to be in his 30s or 40s, were uncovered at the castle near Trondheim in central Norway in 1938]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Skeletal remains, which were discovered in a well at Norway's Sverresborg Castle, have been linked to a centuries-old Norse story by researchers.</p>

<p>In the 800-year-old Sverris saga that follows the story of real-life King Sverre Sigurdsson, the author recounted the tale of tossing the corpse of a man -- later known as "well-man" -- into a well during a central Norway military raid in 1197.</p>

<p>As per the text, the raiders threw the body into the well to poison the main water source of an under-siege castle for locals. Though there was no mention of the identity of the man.</p>

<p>The skeleton of the man, believed to be in his 30s or 40s, was uncovered at the castle near Trondheim in central Norway in 1938, The Telegraph UK reported. Scientists at that time were only able to carry out a visual analysis.</p>

<p>With multiple analytical techniques now available including genetic sequencing and radiocarbon dating, the researchers have now been able to link the skeletal remains to the saga, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/10/25/science/well-man-bones-norse-saga/index.html" rel="no follow, no index">according to CNN</a>.</p>

<p>A study in this regard was published in the Cell Press journal iScience on Friday, revealing major insights into the appearance of the "Well-man" based on in-depth research on samples of his teeth.</p>

<p>The co-author of the study, Michael D Martin said in a statement that this was the first time when a person "described in these historical texts has actually been found".</p>

<p>Mr Martin is a professor in the department of natural history at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology's University Museum in Trondheim.</p>

<p>"There are a lot of these mediaeval and ancient remains all around Europe, and they're increasingly being studied using genomic methods," Mr Martin added.</p>

<p>The radiocarbon dating analysis helped the researchers determine that the skeletal remains were around 800 years old, aligning with the timeline of the Sverris saga.</p>

<p>Mr Martin said that they initially hoped to sequence the body's genome from its bones, considering that they appeared to be in good condition, but the DNA was poorly preserved inside them. So, they used samples of a tooth for genome sequencing. The result showed that the man likely had a medium skin tone along with blue eyes, and light-brown hair.</p>

<p>Then they compared the genome of "Well-man" with the genomes of anonymous modern Norwegians that are stored in reference databases at deCODE Genetics in Iceland.</p>

<p>As a result, it came out that the "well-man" was closely related to the natives of southern Norway.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Elon Musk, world's richest man and an important figure in Donald Trump's US presidential election campaign.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Elon Musk, the world's richest man and an important figure in Donald Trump's US presidential election campaign, has maintained consistent contact with Russian President Vladimir Putin for the past two years, according to a new report.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.wsj.com/world/russia/musk-putin-secret-conversations-37e1c187?mod=hp_lead_pos7">The Wall Street Journal</a> reported that discussions between Elon Musk and Vladimir Putin have covered topics from personal matters to key geopolitical issues. Citing insights from current and former officials across the US, Europe and Russia, the report states that the Russian President allegedly requested Elon Musk to refrain from activating his Starlink satellite internet service over Taiwan — reportedly at the behest of Chinese President and close Putin ally, Xi Jinping.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The implications of this undisclosed channel of communication are substantial. Mr Musk's involvement in critical sectors such as space and communication places him at the centre of US security interests. His company SpaceX, for instance, is responsible for launching satellites crucial to US national security, and his Starlink communications system plays a major role in the ongoing war in Ukraine.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">Elon Musk also owns social media platform X (formerly Twitter), that has reportedly been exploited for Russian disinformation efforts, claimed a report in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/oct/25/elon-musk-has-been-in-regular-contact-with-putin-for-two-years-say-reports">The Guardian.</a></p>

<p dir="ltr">The tech billionaire's influence on the US administration could deepen if Donald Trump wins the presidential election. With substantial financial contributions to Trump's campaign and regular appearances at rallies, Elon Musk's role in a future administration may include heading a government commission on efficiency — a suggestion previously floated by the Republican candidate.</p>

<p dir="ltr">“This is a story about oligarch capture of the US,” said Fiona Hill, former senior director for European and Russian affairs in the Trump administration, adding. “If people like Musk get Trump re-elected, they'll expect all kinds of regulatory gifts in their favour.”&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">She also said that “loads of militaries around the world” heavily rely on Elon Musk's systems.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The Wall Street Journal report stated that the scale of Elon Musk's contacts with Vladimir Putin has been a closely guarded secret, with even senior members of the Joe Biden administration being unaware of it. Musk is yet to respond to these revelations.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the Kremlin's only direct communication with Elon Musk was a single conversation with Vladimir Putin, touching on space and current and future technologies. Peskov denied any regular contact between Elon Musk and Russian officials.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel strikes back. Iranian military bases in the capital Tehran and other cities were struck by missiles earlier today. The attack is a 'response' to Iran's air strikes on October 1 when over 200 rockets and ballistic missiles rained down on Israel to avenge the killing of ally Hezbollah's chief, Hassan Nasrallah.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/israel-iran-war-israel-conducts-precise-strikes-on-iran-explosions-heard-around-tehran-6876065">The early morning strikes "caused limited damage"</a>, says Iran but Israel claims that it now has "wider freedom" to open in skies over Iran. The aftermath of the strikes resulted in a complete lockdown of the airspace in Iran, Syria and Iraq.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As per FlightRadar24, an open-source flight tracking website, no aircraft is flying over the three countries. However, Iran has now announced that it will resume flights after the attacks.</p>

<p>Syria said Israel launched air strikes from the occupied Golan Heights and Lebanon on the capital Damascus, prompting them to activate air defence systems. Syria is part of the Iran-led 'Axis of Resistance', a group of Shia militias and political groups, against Israel and the US in the region.</p>

<p>Iraq said it is preserving the safety of civil aviation in its airspace and decided to lockdown the skies after the attacks. Prohibiting airspace after attacks is part of standard operation procedures of states for security reasons to prevent intrusion of enemy aircraft in the territory and make it easy for air defence systems to identify friendly aircraft in the airspace.</p>

<h2><strong>'Will Face Proportional Reaction'</strong></h2>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/live-updates-israel-will-face-proportional-reaction-says-iran-after-strikes-report-6876417">The tensions never simmered in the region</a> and now Iran says it is ready to respond to the 'act of aggression'.</p>

<p>Iran is prepared to respond to any Israeli "aggression," Iran's semi-official Tasnim news agency reported, citing sources. "There is no doubt that Israel will face a proportional reaction for any action it takes," Tasnim quotes the sources as saying.</p>

<p>The Israeli army has warned Iran that it will "pay a heavy price" if it begins a new round of escalation. Iran said the attack caused "limited damage".</p>

<p>The United States confirmed it was informed of the impending strike, although no US personnel or assets were involved in the operation. Sean Savett, spokesperson for the White House National Security Council, termed Israel's actions as "an exercise of self-defence and in response to Iran's ballistic missile attack against Israel."&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We urge Iran to cease its attacks on Israel so that this cycle of fighting can end without further escalation," said US National Security Council spokesman Sean Savett.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United States urged Iran on Saturday to stop attacking Israel to break the cycle of violence after Israel launched strikes against the Islamic republic in retaliation for a missile barrage.</p>

<p>"We urge Iran to cease its attacks on Israel so that this cycle of fighting can end without further escalation," US National Security Council spokesman Sean Savett told reporters.</p>

<p>The Israeli military conducted air strikes against Iran on Saturday, hitting military bases and missile sites, and other systems in several regions.</p>

<p>"Their response was an exercise in self-defense and specifically avoided populated areas and focused solely on military targets, contrary to Iran's attack against Israel that targeted Israel's most populous city," he added.</p>

<p>Stressing that the United States did not participate in the operation, he said "it is our aim to accelerate diplomacy and de-escalate tensions in the Middle East region".</p>

<p>A senior administration official said President Joe Biden and his national security team have worked with the "Israelis over recent weeks to encourage Israel to conduct a response that was targeted and proportional with low risk of civilian harm".</p>

<p>"And that appears to have been precisely what transpired this evening," the official told reporters.&nbsp;</p>

<p>President Biden had encouraged Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu "to design a response that served to deter further attacks against Israel while reducing risks of further escalation, and that is our objective".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Aggrey Rwetsiba, a Ugandan delegate to the UN's biodiversity summit in Colombia, finds himself in unusual accommodations: a motel normally destined for trysts, with rooms featuring sex swings and stripper poles.</p>

<p>Like other visitors to the Colombian city, his hotel booking fell through, and Rwetsiba had to make last-minute arrangements.</p>

<p>With traditional hotels bursting at the seams, hourly rate motels came to the rescue of stranded delegates like himself.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Showing AFP around his room in the Motel Deseos (Desires), the delegate points to the big double bed, walk-in shower and an unusual feature: a ceiling mirror.</p>

<p>Some of his clothes are draped on hangers from the shower screen, others are folded up in a small cubicle with one door inside the room and another that opens on the hallway.</p>

<p>Usually rented out for a few hours at a time, there are no wardrobes in the rooms. And the double-doored cubicle is for staff to pass drinks to guests seeking seclusion.</p>

<p>"I'm not sure whether I've got the full understanding of what a motel should be, but I have seen some unique features... Like the mirror on the ceiling. I have never seen (that) in a hotel," Rwetsiba told AFP.</p>

<p>He also pointed to the lone wall socket next to the bed, rather than by the table where he needs to power his laptop.</p>

<p>"So the setup is quite different," he said. "I have never seen a hotel with each room having a parking yard," each enclosed, with a private door leading straight into the room.</p>

<h3><strong>Bursting at the seams</strong></h3>

<p>Motel Deseos manager Diana Echeverry proudly showed AFP around the facility, with 40 rooms spread over two floors, and one wing set aside for a dozen COP16 delegates.</p>

<p>In the rest of the building, rooms feature such amenities as Jacuzzis, "kama sutra" loungers and dance poles.</p>

<p>"We have adapted our establishment a little in order to be able to host the guests of COP16 and foreigners," Echeverry told AFP.</p>

<p>Contacted at short notice by local authorities, she said, the motel quickly worked out a daily rate -- 150,000 Colombian pesos (about $35) per night -- and introduced a breakfast service.</p>

<p>Room prices usually range from 65,000 to 100,000 pesos for three hours.</p>

<p>Staff also "took out the love swings, 'love machines,' Kama Sutra chairs and left the rooms without those kinds of items," said Echeverry.</p>

<p>The biodiversity summit has been good for business, she added.</p>

<p>"It has ensured that the (delegates') rooms are occupied during those days and... the remaining rooms now rotate much more to meet the demands of our usual guests."</p>

<p>Cali Mayor Alejandro Eder told reporters this week the city's hotels were "100 percent" full, with Airbnbs, houses and apartments also rented out.</p>

<p>Initial expectations had been for between 12,000 and 15,000 people to attend the COP16, but in the end, there were closer to 23,000 registered delegates, said Eder.</p>

<p>According to Cali's Chamber of Commerce, there are 166 registered motels in the city -- more than anywhere else in Colombia.</p>

<p>Like elsewhere in Latin America, motels are generally places go to for a few private hours with a lover.</p>

<p>In Cali, they boast names such as "Kama Sutra," "Cupido" and "Extasis."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Delighted with the amenities at Motel Deseos, Rwetsiba said he informed other colleagues, and there were now five Ugandan delegates in rooms "more comfortable" than many traditional hotels.</p>

<p>"It's... spacious. That's why we are here. We are not complaining," he said with a big smile.</p>

<p>"We are all happy."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The Mukaab’s design and features are part of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s ‘Saudi Vision 2030’]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Saudi Arabia has begun work on a monumental $50-billion megastructure in Riyadh, aiming to construct what could be the largest building in the world.&nbsp;The megastructure, called ‘The Mukaab,' is a proposed cubical structure set to rise 1,300 feet high and span 1,200 feet wide upon completion — capable of fitting 20 Empire State Buildings within its boundaries, according to a report in <a href="https://www.the-sun.com/tech/12742902/worlds-biggest-building-saudi-arabia/">The Sun</a>.</p>

<p>Envisioned as a futuristic city within a single building, the Mukaab will span 2 million square metres of floor space and is part of Saudi Arabia's expansive development drive to reshape its urban landscape. It will house residential units, hotels, office spaces and a variety of retail, dining and leisure facilities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Mukaab's design and features are part of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's ‘Saudi Vision 2030' – an ambitious programme aimed at reducing the Kingdom's dependence on oil by boosting non-oil GDP by $51 billion and creating 3.34 lakh jobs.</p>

<p>The project's developers also plan to implement immersive, AI-driven technology to enhance visitor experiences. This will include massive screens around the building's exterior, similar to the Las Vegas Sphere.</p>

<p>The Mukaab's architectural inspiration is drawn from Saudi Arabia's traditional and natural heritage. The exterior's cube shape pays homage to the Najdi architectural style, characterised by mud-brick structures and geometric window designs, while the surrounding area will replicate the look of desert wadis — dry riverbeds common in the region.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A video released by Saudi authorities offers a preview of the cityscape where the tower will be constructed. The modern district is planned to include over 1.04 lakh residential units, 9,000 hotel rooms, high-end retail outlets, office spaces as well as dedicated areas for leisure activities and community facilities.</p>

<p>The report also stated that the project has sparked controversy, with some critics noting its resemblance to the Kaaba in Mecca, Islam's most sacred site. In addition, human rights organisations have voiced concerns, highlighting the potential for migrant labour exploitation and the possibility of displacement for local residents due to the scale of the construction.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Four weeks after Iran attacked Israel with a barrage of ballistic missiles to avenge the strikes on ally Hezbollah, the Jewish state responded at the time of its choosing. The tensions never simmered in the region and now Iran says it is ready to respond to the 'act of aggression'.</p>

<p>Iran is prepared to respond to any Israeli "aggression," Iran's semi-official Tasnim news agency reported, citing sources. "There is no doubt that Israel will face a proportional reaction for any action it takes," <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.tasnimnews.com/en/news/2024/10/26/3185861/iran-ready-for-retaliation-against-israel-source" rel="no follow, no index">Tasnim </a>quotes the sources as saying.</p>

<p>The Israeli army has warned Iran that it will "pay a heavy price" if it begins a new round of escalation. Iran said the attack caused "limited damage".</p>

<p><strong>Israel Strikes Back</strong></p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/israel-iran-war-israel-conducts-precise-strikes-on-iran-explosions-heard-around-tehran-6876065">Iranian state TV reported "strong explosions"</a> around Tehran on Saturday morning, without specifying their cause. The semi-official Tasnim News Agency noted that no rockets or aircraft were reported in the skies over Tehran at the time of the explosions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Iranian state TV claimed that the blasts heard around Tehran were due to the "activation of the air defence system." "The loud blasts heard around Tehran were related to the activation of the air defence system against the actions of Zionist regime which attacked three locations outside of Tehran city," state TV reported.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/israel-iran-live-updates-israel-begins-strikes-on-military-targets-in-iran-6875837">Israel-Iran Live Updates: Israel Begins Strikes On Military Targets In Iran</a></p>

<p>Iranian authorities suggested the noises could be related to defensive measures, hinting at the possibility that Iran's air defence systems had been activated.</p>

<p>In addition to Tehran, residents in the nearby city of Karaj reported hearing blasts. Iranian authorities say that operations at critical sites such as the Imam Khomeini International Airport, Mehrabad Airport, and a prominent oil refinery south of Tehran were "normal" and unaffected by the strikes. However, several military bases near Tehran were reportedly targeted by Israeli forces, according to Iran's Fars News Agency.</p>

<p>Israeli officials said the attacks are justified as measures of self-defence. IDF's spokesperson Daniel Hagari also urged Israeli citizens to "remain alert and vigilant."</p>

<p>Israel PM Benjamin Netanyahu and other officials are assessing the security situation after the strikes. Meanwhile, Iran has suspended all flights until further notice.</p>

<p><strong>What Happened On October 1</strong></p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/video-israels-air-defence-system-in-action-to-intercept-iranian-missiles-6695307">A few hours before midnight</a>, Iran attacked Israel with missiles and rockets after tensions escalated in West Asia following artillery and air strikes on Lebanon to target Hezbollah, a Shia militant outfit and a strong ally of Iran.</p>

<p>Iran's Revolutionary Guards said the attack was in response to the killing of Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah.</p>

<p>Videos show the night sky lighting up with explosions after air raid sirens echoed across the country.</p>

<p>The missiles were raining down on Israel and the Iron Dome and Arrow air defence system were in action to intercept and neutralise the targets. Iran fired over 100 missiles, Israeli media reported and several videos showed intercepted missile debris falling over Israeli cities.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Beyonce took the stage Friday and introduced Democrat Kamala Harris at the vice president's White House campaign rally in Houston.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Superstar Beyonce provided the latest shot of stardust to Kamala Harris's White House campaign on Friday, as the vice president and rival Donald Trump courted voters with just 11 days to go in a neck-and-neck election.</p>

<p>Taking the stage with her Destiny's Child co-star Kelly Rowland, the Grammy-winning diva introduced Harris to over 20,000 roaring supporters in the Texas metropolis of Houston, Beyonce's hometown.</p>

<p>"It's time for America to sing a new song," Beyonce said, urging voters to show up.</p>

<p>While the superstar did not perform any hits, her presence brought even more attention to Harris's rally, which focused on abortion restrictions in Republican-led states.</p>

<p>Beyonce said she was not there as a celebrity but as "a mother who cares deeply about the world... a world where we have the freedom to control our bodies."</p>

<p>Texas is not one of the handful of battlegrounds that are expected to decide the presidential election, or where the Democrat and her rival would normally be campaigning in the home stretch.</p>

<p>But Harris is banking on her star-studded show -- which also featured 91-year-old country legend Willie Nelson, who sang "Mamma, don't let them babies grow up to be cowboys" -- to energize her campaign ahead of the final week.</p>

<p>"Voting has already started, and we know this will be a tight race until the very end," Harris said.</p>

<p>"We are 11 days out from an election that will decide the future of America, including the freedom of every woman to make decisions about her own body."</p>

<h3><strong>'Fascist' row</strong></h3>

<p>While Harris was in Houston, Trump was in the state capital Austin, taping an interview with "The Joe Rogan Experience," the United States' most popular podcast.</p>

<p>Trump's follow-on rally, in battleground Michigan, was delayed after his taping with Rogan ran on for three hours.</p>

<p>Harris and Trump also locked horns earlier Friday over accusations that the Republican ex-president has been running as a "fascist."</p>

<p>The two camps traded barbs over claims by Trump's longest-serving White House chief of staff, echoed by Harris, that Trump is a "fascist" who cannot be trusted with power again.</p>

<p>Republican leaders in Congress attacked her over that characterization, in a statement revealing they had been briefed on "ongoing and persistent" threats to Trump, and accused Harris of encouraging "another would-be assassin" after he survived an attempt on his life in July.</p>

<h3><strong>'Garbage can'</strong></h3>

<p>Half the country agrees with Harris that Trump is a fascist, according to a new ABC News/Ipsos poll of registered voters, and she hit back at an impromptu news conference.</p>

<p>"The truth is that some of the people closest to Donald Trump, when he was president... have been very clear about the danger and the threat that (he) poses to America, and the fact that he is unfit to serve," Harris said.</p>

<p>"The American people deserve to hear that, and know about that, so they can make a decision."</p>

<p>Trump described the United States as a "garbage can for the world" for a second time this week while giving remarks in Austin -- the latest in a string of inflammatory comments on immigration.</p>

<p>The race is a dead heat, according to polls. A New York Times/Siena College survey released Friday showed Trump and Harris tied at 48 percent each.</p>

<p>Both candidates have sought to broaden their support by sidestepping newspapers and the big TV networks in favor of podcasts and YouTube shows consumed by uncommitted young voters who could make the difference.</p>

<p>Trump hopes to woo Rogan's massive audience. "The Joe Rogan Experience" was the world's most listened-to podcast on streaming giant Spotify in 2023 and has 17.5 million subscribers on YouTube.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>'Bad things happen'</strong></h3>

<p>Trump's latest remarks ahead of the recording aimed at undermining trust in US elections and alarming Americans about crime committed by undocumented immigrants, who are statistically more law-abiding than the native population.</p>

<p>He complained that elections "go on forever, and bad things happen."</p>

<p>Harris is "here in Texas to rub shoulders with woke celebrities. Isn't that exciting? But she's not going to meet with any of the victims of migrant crime while she's here," he said.</p>

<p>Harris is banking on the issue of abortion to help sell her message that Trump is a threat to Americans' freedoms.</p>

<p>"Texas, what is happening across this state and our country is a health care crisis, and Donald Trump is the architect of it," Harris said, describing the agony of several women who were forced to travel out of state for emergency medical care.</p>

<p>"Please know, no one is protected if there is a Trump national abortion ban."</p>

<p>November's presidential election will be the first held after a 2022 US Supreme Court ruling overturned nationwide protection of abortion.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>South Korea urged Russia to stop its "illegal cooperation" with North Korea and voiced "grave concern" on Friday as Moscow moved to ratify its defence treaty with Pyongyang.</p>

<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky warned shortly after that Russia was planning to send North Korean troops into battle against his country as early as Sunday, and urged world leaders to pile "tangible pressure" on Pyongyang.</p>

<p>Russian lawmakers voted unanimously on Thursday to ratify a defence treaty with North Korea that provides for "mutual assistance" if either party faces aggression. It will now be sent to the upper house of parliament, the Federation Council, for approval.</p>

<p>According to South Korea and the United States, thousands of North Korean troops were training in Russia.</p>

<p>Ukraine said this week that North Korean soldiers had arrived in the "combat zone" in Russia's Kursk border region.</p>

<p>While stopping short of confirming boots on the ground, a North Korean official said any troop deployment to Russia would be in line with international law.</p>

<p>The South Korean government said it "strongly urges the immediate withdrawal of North Korean troops and the cessation of illegal cooperation".</p>

<p>Seoul "expresses grave concern over Russia's ratification of the Russia-North Korea treaty amidst the ongoing deployment of North Korean troops to Russia," the South Korean foreign ministry said in a statement.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Seoul said it would work with allies to "take appropriate measures" over the move, and the country -- a major arms exporter -- has suggested it could revise its longstanding policy that prevents sending weapons directly to Kyiv.</p>

<p>The national security advisors of the United States, South Korea and Japan on Friday discussed the North Korean troop deployment, the White House said, with the officials expressing "grave concern" at the development.</p>

<p>"This deployment is the latest in a series of concerning indicators of deepening military cooperation between the DPRK and Russia," US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said, using the acronym for the official name of North Korea.</p>

<p>Also on Friday leaders of the Group of Seven wealthy democracies finalized details surrounding a $50 billion loan to aid Kyiv, backed by profits from Russia's frozen sovereign assets, according to a statement by G7 leaders.</p>

<p>They said they "have reached a consensus on how to deliver" the loans that will "support Ukraine's budgetary, military and reconstruction assistance", with an aim to start disbursing funds by the end of this year.</p>

<h3><strong>'Punish escalation'</strong></h3>

<p>Zelensky said North Korean troops could be sent to fight Ukrainian troops this weekend.</p>

<p>"The actual involvement of North Korea in hostilities should be met not with a blind eye and confused comments but with tangible pressure on both Moscow and Pyongyang to comply with the UN Charter and to punish escalation," he said on social media.</p>

<p>A senior official within the Ukrainian president's office said the North Korean troops could be deployed either to the Russian region of Kursk or in eastern Ukraine.</p>

<p>Branding the prospect "very worrying", Germany's Chancellor Olaf Scholz said it showed that Russian President Vladimir Putin was facing difficulties in the war.</p>

<p>"It is serious and, of course, something that escalates the situation further," he told German media while visiting India.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Putin said in an interview that aired Friday on state television that it was up to Moscow how it uses the new defence treaty's clause on mutual military assistance.</p>

<p>"It's our sovereign decision, whether we use something or not," Putin said. "Where, how, whether we need this, or (if) we, for example, only carry out some exercises, training, passing on some experience -- that's our business."</p>

<p>Seoul and Washington have long claimed that the nuclear-armed North is shipping arms to Russia.&nbsp;</p>

<p>One of North Korea's United Nations representatives said at the UN General Assembly's First Committee on Disarmament and International Security that the country was sending neither weapons nor soldiers to help Moscow.</p>

<p>The allegations by South Korea and others are "nothing more than groundless rumours aimed at tarnishing the image of DPRK", Rim Mu Song said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>South Korea's representative flagged videos circulating online of North Korean soldiers in Russian uniforms speaking Korean, but Rim said they "again totally reject the allegation" of troop deployment.</p>

<p>On Friday, a diplomatic official in Pyongyang argued that his country would be well within its rights to deploy soldiers on Russian soil.</p>

<p>"If there is such a thing that the world media is talking about, I think it will be an act conforming with the regulations of international law," said Kim Jong Gyu, North Korea's vice foreign minister in charge of Russian affairs.</p>

<h3><strong>'Provocation'</strong></h3>

<p>South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol has called the deployment a "provocation that threatens global security beyond the Korean Peninsula and Europe".</p>

<p>Yoon also said South Korea will review its stance on providing weapons to Ukraine.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Seoul has already sold billions of dollars of tanks, howitzers, attack aircraft and rocket launchers to Poland, a key ally of Kyiv.</p>

<p>In June, South Korea agreed to transfer the knowledge needed to build K2 tanks to Poland, which experts have said could be a key step towards production inside Ukraine.</p>

<p>South Korea's Hanwha Aerospace has signed a $1.64-billion deal with Poland to supply rocket artillery units.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli strikes on military targets in Iran are "an exercise of self-defense" following Tehran's ballistic missile attack earlier this month, the United States said late Friday, adding it was informed ahead of the strikes.</p>

<p>White House National Security Council spokesman Sean Savett said the "targeted strikes on military targets" are "an exercise of self-defense and in response to Iran's ballistic missile attack against Israel on October 1."</p>

<p>The United States was "informed beforehand and there is no US involvement," a US defense official told AFP, under the condition of anonymity.</p>

<p>The official did not say how far in advance the United States had been informed or what had been shared by Israel.</p>

<p>White House officials said in separate statements later that President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris had been briefed on the strikes and would continue to receive updates from their national security teams.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>G7 leaders have finalized details surrounding a $50 billion loan to aid Kyiv, backed by profits from Russian sovereign assets frozen after its invasion of Ukraine, according to a statement released Friday.</p>

<p>Leaders of the Group of Seven wealthy democracies said they "have reached a consensus on how to deliver" the loans of approximately $50 billion, with an aim to start disbursing funds by the end of this year.</p>

<p>"The loan proceeds will be disbursed through multiple channels to support Ukraine's budgetary, military and reconstruction assistance," G7 leaders added.</p>

<p>Their announcement came as world financial leaders gathered in Washington this week for meetings hosted by the International Monetary Fund and World Bank.</p>

<p>Finance ministers have "agreed on a technical solution ensuring consistency, coordination, fair distribution of lending, and solidarity among all G7 partners," the statement said.</p>

<p>"We will not tire in our resolve to give Ukraine the support it needs to prevail," the leaders added.</p>

<p>They called on Moscow to end its war and pay for damage caused to Ukraine.</p>

<h3><strong>$20 bn US support</strong></h3>

<p>This week, US President Joe Biden said that as part of the G7 package, the United States would provide $20 billion in loans to Ukraine, to be paid back by the interest earned from immobilized Russian sovereign assets.</p>

<p>This is aimed at supporting Ukraine now, "without burdening taxpayers."</p>

<p>"Our efforts make it clear: tyrants will be responsible for the damages they cause," Biden said.</p>

<p>US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen signed a statement Wednesday with her Ukrainian counterpart Sergii Marchenko marking their intent to enter into the loan.</p>

<p>The move also committed that new United States or Ukrainian tax dollars would not be the source of repayment.</p>

<p>Economic concerns remain top-of-mind for US voters, with just over a week to go before the country's presidential election on November 5.</p>

<p>Washington aims to provide at least $10 billion of the loans for economic support, with the other half expected to take the form of military aid.</p>

<p>But this will require additional authorization from Congress.</p>

<p>The remaining $30 billion in loans is set to come from a combination of G7 partners, including the European Union, United Kingdom, Canada and Japan, US officials said.</p>

<p>"We have once again made clear our unwavering commitment to stand by Ukraine for as long as it takes," said the G7 statement on Friday.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Time is not on President (Vladimir) Putin's side."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The tool's first-ever application found that human activity had made a mid-June east coast heave wave two to 10 times more likely.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Canada's environment ministry said Friday that climate change had made nearly all the heat waves recorded this summer more likely, including in an Arctic area where temperatures hit 35 degrees Celcius.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, Environment and Climate Change Canada debuted a new tool that examines the connection between human-caused climate change and extreme weather, by comparing current data with pre-industrial data.</p>

<p>The tool's first-ever application found that human activity had made a mid-June east coast heave wave two to 10 times more likely.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In its latest analysis, the ministry looked at the 37 hottest heat waves recorded this summer across the country.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Four of those 37 were made at least 10 times more likely by human activity. For 28 of the heat waves, the figures were two to 10 times more likely.</p>

<p>"Throughout the summer, we saw above normal temperatures shift across different regions of Canada," environment ministry researcher Nathan Gillet said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Over the past 77 years, summer temperatures have warmed by 1.7 degrees Celsius, nationally, on average, and the principal cause of this warming is human-induced climate change," he told reporters.&nbsp;</p>

<p>One area of the Arctic, the Qikiqtaaluk region of Nunavut, experienced a heat wave that lasted 25 days over September and October.</p>

<p>Further west, in the Arctic town of Inuvik in the Northwest Territories, temperatures hit 35 degrees this summer.</p>

<p>"This is really exceptional in that region," Gillet said.</p>

<p>The ministry said Canada is warming at roughly double the global average rate, and the rate of warming in the Arctic is three times higher than the global average.</p>

<p>"These 'once in 100 years' climate-related weather events are becoming more frequent, severe, and costly," the ministry said.</p>

<p>This winter, the environment ministry expects to use its new tool to assess the correlation between human-caused climate change and extreme cold snaps.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A prolific "catfish" offender whose cruel campaign of global online blackmail targeted thousands of young victims and drove a 12-year-old US girl to suicide was on Friday jailed for life.</p>

<p>Alexander McCartney, 26, posed online as a teenage girl to befriend young females across the world on the social media app Snapchat, forcing them to send him explicit pictures, then threatening to make them public.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He admitted 185 charges involving 70 children and was told he would spend at least 20 years behind bars.</p>

<p>Detective Chief Superintendent Eamonn Corrigan, of the Police Service of Northern Ireland, said McCartney was a "disgusting child predator" whose offending had been on an "industrial scale".</p>

<p>"Sitting in his childhood bedroom in Newry (in Northern Ireland), he began his offending as a late teenager and built what can only be described as a paedophile enterprise," he told reporters outside court.</p>

<p>"McCartney is a dangerous, relentless, cruel paedophile," he added.</p>

<p>Cimarron Thomas from West Virginia in the United States took her own life in May 2018 after McCartney demanded that she involve her younger sister in sex acts he had coerced her into.</p>

<p>Eighteen months later, her distraught father Ben Thomas also died by suicide.</p>

<p>Belfast Crown Court heard earlier other victims had been in the United States as well as in Australia and New Zealand.</p>

<h3><strong>'Sexual deviant'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Sentencing McCartney, judge John O'Hara said he was unaware of any other case in which an offender had used social media to "inflict such terrible and catastrophic damage on young girls up to and including the death of a 12-year-old girl".</p>

<p>"It is truly difficult to think of a sexual deviant who poses a greater risk than this defendant," he added.</p>

<p>O'Hara said McCartney had been "remorseless" in his offending, ignoring "multiple pleas for mercy".</p>

<p>Even after his third arrest, he said, the former computer science student kept offending in "an even more sinister, dramatic and appalling manner".</p>

<p>McCartney previously pleaded guilty to manslaughter relating to Cimarron's death.</p>

<p>Corrigan told reporters McCartney had even started a countdown when Cimarron threatened to kill herself with a legally owned firearm and told her: "I don't care."</p>

<p>"He may as well have pulled the trigger himself," he added. "There's only one place for him, that's behind bars."</p>

<p>McCartney also admitted 59 counts of blackmail, dozens of charges related to making and distributing indecent photographs and scores more of inciting children to engage in sexual activity.</p>

<h3><strong>'Horrific'</strong></h3>

<p>Police in Northern Ireland worked with other forces internationally to bring him to justice.</p>

<p>Derek Gordon, the US special agent in charge of Homeland Security Investigations based in Washington DC, praised the investigation and prosecution of McCartney by Northern Irish counterparts as "nothing short of brilliant".</p>

<p>"Alexander McCartney committed some horrific and disturbing crimes and deserves every minute he serves in prison," he said.</p>

<p>Catherine Kierans, from the Northern Ireland Public Prosecution Service, said McCartney was estimated to have targeted 3,500 girls, some as young as 10.</p>

<p>Despite exhaustive efforts, however, many of his victims may never be identified.</p>

<p>She urged any child or young person to seek help if they were being threatened by someone demanding sexual images or videos.</p>

<p>"This is a crime. You are not to blame. Please talk to a trusted adult," she said, praising the bravery of the victims who had helped to convict McCartney.</p>

<p>And she called on parents and carers to talk to their children to keep them safe online.</p>

<p>"It is by bringing these issues out into the open that we can break the cycle of secrecy abusers rely on," she said.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p><p><div class='table-div suicide'><table class='table'><thead><tr><th colspan='2'>Helplines</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Vandrevala Foundation for Mental Health</td><td><a href='tel:+919999666555'>9999666555</a> or <a href='mailto:help@vandrevalafoundation.com'>help@vandrevalafoundation.com</a> </td></tr><tr><td>TISS iCall</td><td><a href='tel:+912225521111'>022-25521111</a> (Monday-Saturday: 8 am to 10 pm)</td></tr> <tr><td colspan='2'>(If you need support or know someone who does, please reach out to your nearest mental health specialist.)</td></tr></tbody></table></div></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With less than two weeks left for the presidential polls, the race seems extremely tight with both Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump tied at 48 per cent in the popular vote, according to the final national poll conducted by the New York Times and Siena College.</p>

<p>The results of the poll are not encouraging for Harris as it comes just less than two weeks ahead of the elections and as millions of people across the US have already cast votes, according to the New York Times.</p>

<p>The elections in the US are set to be held on November 5, with former US President Donald Trump running for a second term and Vice President Kamala Harris aiming to create history by becoming the first woman president of the US.</p>

<p>In recent elections, Democrats have had an edge in the popular vote while they have lost the Electoral College and thus the White House. They have been looking to Harris to build a strong national lead as an indication that she would perform well in such critical swing states like Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin, as reported by the New York Times.</p>

<p>Harris and Trump remain tied even after three months of the most tumultuous months in the recent political history of the US.</p>

<p>In the past few months, the presidential nominees of the Democratic and Republican parties have participated in high-profile debates, two assassination attempts on Trump have been made and the two leaders have held dozens of rallies across the seven battlefield states. In the past few months, hundreds of millions spent on advertisements have seemingly done little to change the trajectory of the race.</p>

<p>Kamala Harris' position, might have declined among likely voters since the last Times/Siena College poll, conducted in early October, the report added.</p>

<p>At the time, Kamala Harris had a narrow lead over Donald Trump, 49 per cent to 46 per cent. The change is within the margin of error. However, the Times's national polling average has registered a tightening in polls over the past few weeks.</p>

<p>Although the latest Times/Siena College poll has given a glimpse into national sentiment, ever, the presidential election will be decided in the seven battleground states where Trump and Harris have spent a lot of their resources and time.</p>

<p>Most polls in those states -- Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Arizona, Georgia, Michigan -- indicate the contest is equally close.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A NASA astronaut who just returned from the International Space Station has been hospitalized for an unspecified medical condition but remains stable, the US space agency said Friday.</p>

<p>The four-member Crew-8 mission splashed down off the coast of Florida early Friday after nearly eight months aboard the orbital laboratory.</p>

<p>On its way back to Earth, the SpaceX Dragon executed a normal re-entry and splashdown, and recovery of the crew and spacecraft was without incident, NASA said in a blog post.</p>

<p>But during routine medical assessments on the recovery ship, an "additional evaluation of the crew members was requested out of an abundance of caution," it added, without elaborating.</p>

<p>NASA astronauts Matthew Dominick, Michael Barratt and Jeanette Epps, and Roscosmos cosmonaut Alexander Grebenki were all flown to Ascension Sacred Heart Pensacola.</p>

<p>Three were subsequently released, while one of the NASA astronauts remains at the hospital "under observation as a precautionary measure."</p>

<p>NASA said it would not disclose specific medical information to protect the crew member's privacy but would provide updates as available.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Elizabeth Francis, who was the oldest living person in the United States, has died at the age of 115. Ms Francis died peacefully on Tuesday while surrounded by her family, granddaughter Ethel Harrison, who was also her primary caregiver told <em>ABC News</em>. At the time of her death, Ms Francis was the oldest living person in the US and the third-oldest person in the world, according to LongeviQuest, a global database of the world's oldest individuals. She lived most of her life in Houston, Texas, per the outlet.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Speaking to <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Living/elizabeth-francis-oldest-living-person-us-dies-115/story?id=115087261">ABC News</a>,</em> Ms Harrison described Ms Francis as a "person who loved people". "She loved the Lord. Her faith was extremely strong. She was always, you know, jolly, you know, 'how you doing? You're doing okay?' That was just her personality. And she would always say, treat people like you want to be treated. And that was her motto," Ms Harrison added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Separately, in a statement, LongeviQuest spokesperson, Ben Meyers, called Ms Francis "America's Grandmother". "She lived a life of faith and love, always crediting the Good Lord for her longevity. She was beloved by her family and community," Mr Meyers said.</p>

<p>"They are in our prayers, especially her daughter Ms. Dorothy Williams, whom she lived with until the end, and her granddaughter Ms. Ethel Harrison whose joyful dedication made it possible for her grandmother to live at home even at age 115," he added.</p>

<p>Ms Francis was born in Louisiana on July 25, 1909. She lived through everything from World War I to the sinking of the Titanic. She raised her daughter as a single mother, ran a coffee shop in Houston and preferred walking over driving. The 115-year-old was alive during the Great Depression, the first aeroplane flight across the Atlantic and 20 presidents from William Howard Taft to Joe Biden.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Earlier this year, on her 115th birthday, Ms Francis also offered a single tip on how to live a long and happy life. "Speak your mind and don't hold your tongue," she said.</p>

<p>Notably, Ms Francis was crowned the country's oldest person in February earlier this year after the previous longevity record holder, Edie Ceccarelli, died a few weeks after her 116th birthday in California. In April, she was then awarded a plaque recognising her as the oldest person in the US from LongeviQuest.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now, America's oldest living person is Naomi Whitehead, who was born on September 26, 1910, according to LongeviQuest.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Israel has launched targeted strikes against Iran, with its military saying the strikes are in response to the October 1 missile attack, during which Iran fired approximately 200 ballistic missiles at Israel.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sp_only-ul-ol sp_only-ul-ol-2">
<ol class="CetSht_ol">
	<li class="CetSht_li">&nbsp;"In response to months of continuous attacks from the regime in Iran against the State of Israel, the IDF is conducting precise strikes on military targets in Iran," the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement.<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/israel-iran-live-updates-israel-begins-strikes-on-military-targets-in-iran-6875837"> Israeli officials</a> have clarified that these attacks are justified as measures of self-defence. IDF's spokesperson Daniel Hagari also urged Israeli citizens to "remain alert and vigilant."</li>
	<li>The United States confirmed it was informed of the impending strike, although no US personnel or assets were involved in the operation. Sean Savett, spokesperson for the White House National Security Council, termed Israel's actions as "an exercise of self-defence and in response to Iran's ballistic missile attack against Israel."&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Iranian state TV reported "strong explosions" around Tehran on Saturday morning, without specifying their cause. The semi-official Tasnim News Agency noted that no rockets or aircraft were reported in the skies over Tehran at the time of the explosions.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Iranian state TV claimed that the blasts heard around Tehran were due to the "activation of the air defence system." "The loud blasts heard around Tehran were related to the activation of the air defence system against the actions of Zionist regime which attacked three locations outside of Tehran city," state TV reported</li>
	<li>Iranian authorities suggested the noises could be related to defensive measures, hinting at the possibility that Iran's air defence systems had been activated.</li>
	<li>In addition to Tehran, residents in the nearby city of Karaj reported hearing blasts. Iranian authorities say that operations at critical sites such as the Imam Khomeini International Airport, Mehrabad Airport, and a prominent oil refinery south of Tehran were "normal" and unaffected by the strikes. However, several military bases near Tehran were reportedly targeted by Israeli forces, according to Iran's Fars News Agency.</li>
	<li>Reports of explosions from Syria's state news agency SANA noted that Syrian air defences were activated in response to "hostile targets" near the capital, Damascus. While there was no official statement connecting the Syrian incidents directly to the Israeli strikes in Iran, explosions were heard in Damascus and central regions.</li>
	<li>In recent weeks, Israel has intensified operations against Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon - both allies of Iran - following an unprecedented attack by Hamas on southern Israel on October 7, 2023.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>This brutal assault, labelled the deadliest attack in Israel's history, has triggered relentless Israeli offensives across Gaza and heightened security measures along Israel's northern border with Lebanon to counter Hezbollah's influence.</li>
	<li>Israel's defence minister warned earlier this week that any attempt to harm Israel would result in a "heavy price". The United States, while voicing its support for Israel's right to defend itself, has been diplomatically active, pushing to prevent a chain reaction that could destabilise the entire region.</li>

<p>Iran's state TV also confirmed that several strong explosions were heard around the capital, but there was no official comment about the source of the explosions. A few hours later, several explosions were heard in the capital Tehran, which the Iranian state media said was because of the activation of air defence systems.</p>

<p>According to Fox News, the White House was notified shortly before Israel carried out air strikes on Iran.</p>

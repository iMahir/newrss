       <description><![CDATA[As US law enforcement officials continue to determine the motive behind the 20-year-old shooting at Donald Trump, the word 'Staged' became a trend on social media in the country, within minutes after the fatal attack.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Months ahead of the crucial presidential elections in the US, Donald Trump became the target of an apparent assassination attempt at a rally in Pennsylvania. This came days before the former president was scheduled to accept the Republican nomination for a third time.</p>

<p>While law enforcement officials are trying to determine the motive behind the 20-year-old opening fire from a nearby rooftop, the word 'Staged' became a trend on social media in the country within minutes of the attack.</p>

<p>This word has become synonymous with extreme conspiracy theories across social media platforms, being frequently used to question the veracity of an attack or shooting.</p>

<p>In the last 24 hours, it has overtaken other topics in popular internet discourse, as millions of views have been received by posts on X that are filled with unsupported rumours, hate speech, and abuse, BBC reported.</p>

<p>However, it must be noted that conspiracy theories have historically been drawn to assassination attempts on US presidents, with the most well-known example being the assassination of John F Kennedy back in November 1963. As it was the first to occur in real-time, it was unsurprising that false reports took off, the report stated.</p>

<p>The trend was not just limited to committed groups of political supporters and was actively recommended in users' "For You" feeds as they tried to make sense of what had happened. Further, it was frequently posted by individuals having blue ticks, thereby providing their posts more prominence.</p>

<h2><strong>Questions raised</strong></h2>

<p>Some of these conspiracy theories centred on the alleged security failings, with social media users questioning how such a thing could happen.</p>

<p>"It looks very staged... Nobody in the crowd is running or panicking. Nobody in the crowd heard an actual gun. I don't trust it. I don't trust him," read a post that received millions of views.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">It looks very staged. Sounded like a BB gun. Nobody in the crowd is running or panicking.<br />
<br />
Nobody in that crowd heard an actual gun.<br />
I don't trust it. I don't trust him. ????????‍♀️ <a href="https://t.co/b1Bkruyq2g">pic.twitter.com/b1Bkruyq2g</a></p>
— ???????????????? É???????????? (@cyberfrontier) <a href="https://twitter.com/cyberfrontier/status/1812253969235968020?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 13, 2024</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Later, the post was labelled with a note pointing out the shooting was real.</p>

<p>Moreover, these conspiracy theories were further compounded by the photographs and videos that later came out. In particular, one photograph showed the former US president's fist raised, having blood on his face and ear, while the US flag can be seen in the background.</p>

<p>The image was just "too damn perfect," a US-based YouTuber stated and further emphasised how they managed to get "the flag positioned perfect and everything".</p>

<p>However, this post, which received nearly a million views, was later removed by the person who shared it.</p>

<p>Another X user wrote, "Staged to get sympathy? You can't trust these people with anything and no, I'm not going to pray for him".</p>

<p>However, the BBC report highlighted that most of these viral posts came from left-leaning users, often seen posting anti-Trump views.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the country reeled from images of a bloodied Donald Trump waving his fist after the gunman opened fire at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania yesterday, Joe Biden - in his address to the nation - called for unity and said that US politics "must never be a literal battlefield."</p>

<p>While he appeared to start off well, the US President soon began to stumble over his words.</p>

<p>During his speech, Joe Biden inadvertently referred to resolving differences at the "battle box" instead of the "ballot box."</p>

<p>Democrats are closely watching the president following a disastrous debate performance and a series of gaffes, renewing concerns about his age and ability to govern.</p>

<p>Joe Biden last week introduced Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as his Russian rival Vladimir Putin.</p>

<p>"And now I want to hand it over to the president of Ukraine, who has as much courage as he has determination, ladies and gentlemen, President Putin," he said, referring to Zelenskyy while speaking on the sidelines of the NATO Summit in Washington.</p>

<p>He then quickly corrected himself and said, "President Putin, you're going to beat President Putin, President Zelenskyy. I am so focused on beating Putin."</p>

<p>Shortly afterward, Biden made another blunder when he referred to his deputy, Kamala Harris, as "Vice President" Trump at a high-stakes news conference.</p>

<p>The 81-year-old has so far defied calls to step aside. Allies have warned he needs to do more to convince his party and the public that, as he insists, only he can beat Trump in the presidential race.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump's convention speech will now focus on unity - and not aimed at President Joe Biden's policies - after the assassination attempt that he believes has changed the election discourse.</p>

<p>Images showing Trump with a bloodied face after the attack have sparked a wave of sympathy for the 78-year-old Republican, who is now galvanizing his supporters by exhibiting defiant resilience.</p>

<p>He has rewritten his conversion speech entirely in light of the shooting, he told Washington Examiner a day after the attack.</p>

<p>Trump, who will be nominated as the official Republican candidate against Democrat Joe Biden at this convention later this evening, said he wanted to take advantage of the historic moment.</p>

<p>He said his speech aimed at Biden's policies would have been "one of the most incredible speeches", but it's going to be a "whole different speech now."</p>

<p>Trump said he has switched from trying to excite his voter base to demonstrating his belief that Saturday's attack had entirely changed the election campaign. His speech, the report cited him as saying, will meet the moment that history demands.</p>

<p>"This is a chance to bring the whole country, even the whole world, together. The speech will be a lot different, a lot different than it would've been two days ago," said the Republican.</p>

<p>A bullet pierced the upper part of his right ear at a Pennsylvania rally on Saturday as the Secret Service bundled the former president to safety. Videos in slow-motion showed a simple head tilt by Trump saved a tragedy.</p>

<p>Trump said he had turned away from the crowd to a screen showing data that he was using in his speech - which saved him from death. "God alone who prevented the unthinkable from happening," he posted online after the attack.</p>

<p>On raising his hand when the Secret Service was leading him off the stage, he told the Washington Examiner he wanted to let the people know that he was alright. The photo showing Trump holding his fist in the air as blood ran down his face has already become iconic this election season.</p>

<p>The attack claimed the life of a bystander while snipers shot dead the gunman, later identified as Thomas Crooks.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the aftermath of an assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania, Democrats are treading cautiously, navigating a complex landscape of political ramifications and moral considerations, The Hill reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>President Joe Biden, out of respect for Trump and in response to the tragic events, has suspended all political activities, including the cessation of political advertisements. This pause has prompted introspection among Biden's allies and party operatives, who are grappling with the potential impact of this dramatic turn of events on the presidential race.</p>

<p>"There are more questions than answers right now," admitted a top Democratic strategist and close Biden ally. "I don't think anyone knows how this will turn out, even this week. There are so many unknowns," as reported by The Hill.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The debate over Biden's candidacy, particularly concerning his age and mental acuity, has been temporarily shelved. Multiple Democratic sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, acknowledged the sensitivity of the topic in the immediate aftermath of the shooting.</p>

<p>While discussions about Biden potentially withdrawing from the race have dominated recent headlines and discussions, many Democrats, from lawmakers to donors, have chosen to remain silent on the issue for now.</p>

<p>"This is not the time," remarked a Democratic donor who had previously expressed reservations about Biden. "That's not to say it won't come back in a few days or next week. But it would be incredibly insensitive to have the debate on Biden right now."</p>

<p>"We all need to take a breath and see what happens," the donor added.</p>

<p>Amidst the sombre atmosphere following the assassination attempt, the focus has shifted from internal Democratic deliberations to broader concerns about how this event might reshape the political landscape as the Republican National Convention looms.</p>

<p>Another Democratic strategist predicted that the focus on Saturday's tragic events would "slow the public noise but I don't think it slows the private conversations.</p>

<p>"I've seen enough data to show my guy trailing. And the state-by-state numbers are really rough."</p>

<p>Political observers note that the pressure on Biden to withdraw from the race may diminish in the short term, given the national attention now fixated on the attempt on Trump's life.</p>

<p>"The clock is ticking and right now many Democrats won't focus on this as the nation is consumed with the assassination attempt," said Julian Zelizer, a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University. "Some will believe destabilising the ticket will be too hard to do."</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Zelizer cautioned that underlying issues for Biden remain and could worsen, especially as Trump emerges from the incident with renewed political vigor.</p>

<p>On Sunday, three national polls provided a mixed picture for Biden, showing him holding steady against Trump despite recent challenges. However, the aftermath of the assassination attempt could alter this dynamic significantly.</p>

<p>As the Biden campaign remains on hold, Republican strategist Susan Del Percio predicted a swift shift in focus as news of Trump's vice presidential pick and the commencement of the Republican convention dominate headlines.</p>

<p>"The question I wonder about is, what Republicans will do and say because Democrats will be more careful and they're way more responsible with their words," she commented.</p>

<p>"I can't imagine day one of the convention happening without fiery and ugly words about Joe Biden," she added. "That allows for a response from the Biden campaign. That's what's going to start the re-engagement frankly."</p>

<p>Since the attempt on Trump's life, Biden has assumed the role of consoler-in-chief, maintaining a stance of national unity even with his longtime rival. This approach was underscored by Biden's briefing inside the Situation Room and a planned address to the nation from the Oval Office.</p>

<p>Despite the temporary halt in campaigning, strategists view Biden's leadership during this crisis as potentially strengthening his candidacy.</p>

<p>"It helps Biden's argument," remarked a strategist. "He represents stability. He's managing a crisis. And in a way, he's answering the argument about his mental acuity."</p>

<p>"And that creates a contrast with Trump," the strategist added. "You can't count on Trump to be stable for so long. And when Trump starts Trumping, it's game on," The Hill reported.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The gunman who shot at former president Donald Trump during an election rally in Pennsylvania on Saturday appears to have acted alone, said the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), which is probing the incident as a potential "domestic terrorism" act.</p>

<p>The gunman, shot dead by a sniper, has been identified as Thomas Matthew Crooks (20).</p>

<p>"At this point in the investigation, it appears that he was a lone actor, but we still have more investigation to go," said Robert Wells, the executive assistant director of the FBI's National Security Branch.</p>

<p>The FBI, he said, is investigating this as an assassination attempt and also as a "potential domestic terrorism act". The counterterrorism division and criminal divisions are working together to determine the motive, he added.</p>

<p>Trump was left with a bloodied face after a bullet pierced the upper part of his right ear. He is now safe and continuing with his schedule that includes travelling to Milwaukee to attend the Republican National Convention, which would formally nominate him as the party's presidential nominee against incumbent Joe Biden.</p>

<p>The FBI is leading the investigation into the assassination attempt.</p>

<p>"The shooter may be deceased, but the investigation is very much ongoing. And, because of that, we are limited in what we say at this point," FBI Director Christopher Wray said.</p>

<p>"What we witnessed yesterday was nothing short of an attack on democracy and our democratic process," he told reporters at a news conference in Washington DC.</p>

<p>According to an FBI official, the investigation into the gunman at Donald Trump's rally Saturday has not yet turned up any mental health issues, threatening posts, or other motives, but cautioned it was still early.</p>

<p>The shooter, as per FBI, used an AR-style rifle chambered in 5.56mm, a common calibre for such weapons.</p>

<p>The New York Times said authorities were scouring the gunman's social media and other property as they sought to determine a motive for the attack.</p>

<p>Biden is likely to address the nation at 8 pm from the Oval Office. He will give "a forceful and needed address to update the nation on the horrifying attack on Donald Trump and the need for every American to come together to not just condemn, but put to an end political violence in this country once and for all," a campaign official told the daily.</p>

<p>Crooks graduated from the Community College of Allegheny County two months ago, earning an associate degree in engineering science, school officials said in a statement, adding that they were "shocked and saddened by the horrific turn of events."</p>

<p>Kimberly Cheatle, the director of the Secret Service, in a memo to her agents, said "The attempted assassination of former President Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, is a moment that will forever be remembered in history."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The portrait pieced together so far of the 20-year-old nursing home aide who allegedly tried to assassinate Donald Trump at an election rally reveals frustratingly little about why he would make such an attempt - or how he managed to come so close to killing the former president.</p>

<p>The early details that have emerged about Thomas Matthew Crooks, who was shot dead by law enforcement, show a young man working an entry-level job near his hometown in Pennsylvania, where he graduated from high school in 2022 with a reputation as a bright but quiet classmate. His high school counselor described him as "respectful" and said he never knew Crooks to be political.</p>

<p>The FBI said on Sunday that Crooks' social media profile does not contain threatening language, nor have they found any history of mental health issues. They said he acted alone and have not identified a motive.</p>

<p>What is unique about Crooks - when compared to other recent shooters who opened fire at schools, churches, malls and parades - is that he came within inches of killing a presidential candidate.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On Saturday afternoon, Crooks slipped onto a rooftop location 140 meters from the stage where Trump was speaking in Butler, Pennsylvania. He then began firing an AR-15-style semiautomatic rifle, purchased by his father, officials said.</p>

<p>The gunfire killed a 50-year-old man, critically wounded two other spectators, and struck Trump's ear - an assassination attempt that has further inflamed an already bitter U.S. political divide.</p>

<p>A resident of Bethel Park, about an hour away from where the shooting occurred, Crooks was a registered Republican who would have been eligible to cast his first presidential vote in the Nov. 5 election in which Trump is challenging President Joe Biden. Public records show his father is a registered Republican and his mother a registered Democrat, and that as a 17-year-old Crooks made a $15 donation to a Democratic Party cause.</p>

<p>Crooks was employed as a dietary aide at a nursing home at the time of the shooting, the home's administrator said in a statement.</p>

<p>"We are shocked and saddened to learn of his involvement as Thomas Matthew Crooks performed his job without concern and his background check was clean," said Marcie Grimm, administrator of the Bethel Park Skilled Nursing and Rehabilitation Center.</p>

<p>NEVER KNOWN TO BE POLITICAL</p>

<p>Two years ago, Crooks graduated from the local high school, where he showed no particular interest in politics, according to one classmate who asked not to be identified. Crooks' interests centered on building computers and playing games, the classmate said in an interview.</p>

<p>"He was super smart. That's what really kind of threw me off was, this was, like, a really, really smart kid, like he excelled," the classmate said. "Nothing crazy ever came up in any conversation."</p>

<p>Jim Knapp, who retired from his job as the school counselor at Bethel Park High School in 2022, said Crooks had always been "quiet as a churchmouse," "respectful" and kept to himself, although he did have a few friends.</p>

<p>He rarely came across Crooks because "he wasn't a needy type kid," Knapp said. Crooks was content to occasionally eat lunch by himself in the school cafeteria, said Knapp, who would engage such students to see if they wanted company.</p>

<p>"Kids weren't calling him names, kids weren't bullying him," Knapp said.</p>

<p>Knapp said he never knew Crooks to be political in any way, even as other kids would sometimes wear Trump or Biden attire. He added that he couldn't recall Crooks ever being disciplined in school.</p>

<p>"Anybody could snap, anybody could have issues," he said. "Something triggered that young man and drove him to drive up to Butler yesterday and do what he did."</p>

<p>Residents near the Crooks' home described feeling shocked and unsettled that an assassination attempt has been linked to a person from the sedate city of 33,000 people.</p>

<p>"Bethel Park is a pretty blue-collar type of area, and to think that somebody was that close is a little insane," said Wes Morgan, a 42-year-old who works at an investment management company and bikes with his children on the same street as the Crooks' residence.</p>

<p>A couple standing on the porch of their nearby brick ranch-style home was left processing the events and spotlight on their neighborhood.</p>

<p>"There's never been a gun issue. There's never been the police being called," Mary Priselac, 67, said alongside her husband. "You kind of have to wonder what didn't he get in life? What led to this extreme?"</p>

<p>Crooks' gun — an AR-style 556 rifle — had been legally bought, the FBI officials said, adding that the FBI believed it had been purchased by the suspect's father. The officials said "a suspicious device" was found in the suspect's vehicle, which was inspected by bomb technicians and rendered safe.</p>

<p>Bruce Piendl, owner of Allegheny Arms and Gunworks in Bethel Park, said guns were part of the culture in the area. "You have to understand in western Pennsylvania we have a rich tradition of hunting and fishing and outdoor stuff," he said. "Within 10 miles (16 km) of here, there are a ton of gun clubs."</p>

<p>Piendl said his record show he did not sell any firearms to the shooter but declined to say whether he sold any to his family.</p>

<p>"That's between me and God," Piendl said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The moment a bullet grazed the ear of former US president Donald Trump during an assassination attempt on him at a rally in US's Pennsylvania was captured by a New York Times photographer. The image clicked by Doug Mills, a veteran photographer who was standing just a few feet away from Trump, shows the bullet behind the 78-year-old leader's face after it clipped his right ear.</p>

<p>Mr Mills, who has been covering the US presidents since 1983, said he did not know he had captured the bullet in one of his photographs.</p>

<p>"It happened so fast but now I can see it all in slow-motion. I was taking pictures when the pops started happening. I just happened to have my finger on the shutter and I heard the pops and kept shooting. I didn't know what I had captured but when I got to my laptop I could see that bullet flying behind his head because it is definitely not in the frames right before it and it's not in afterwards. It's only that one frame. I was shooting in 1/1,800 of a second. It captured that streak behind him," he said.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The photo he captured shows a long white streak behind Trump's head, showing the apparent path of a bullet used in the assassination attempt against the former president. "I never thought I'd ever see an assassination attempt on a president and be there to photograph it," Mr Mills said.</p>

<p>According to Mills, he was at the right place at the right time and his long experience of covering presidents helped him capture the crucial moments after the attack</p>

<p>"I've covered the president for 40+ years and I've always known which way they come onstage and which way they go off. And the closest stairs were to my right so I ran over to that side and witnessed him being helped up to his feet, and my immediate reaction was "Oh my god! He is alive", he said</p>

<p>The photographer also described the president's initial reaction after he realised that he survived an attempted assassination. "All of a sudden, he got near the edge of the stage and raised up his fist in defiance. And I could see the blood on his face and that defiance went away like in a split second. He became very serious. I thought he looked very pale," Mr Mill said.</p>

<p>"Two very different moments happened, you know, in a matter of seconds. It is a moment unlike any in my lifetime, my history, my job of covering the White House since 1983. You never think about something like this ever happening because it is so frightening," he added.</p>

<p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) identified the assassin as 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks. The investigation agency also now released a photo of the young attacker.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Crooks was shot down by Secret Service snipers after he fired multiple shots at the former US president in the rally from a nearby rooftop. Witnesses claimed they tried to warn the security officials about a man moving from roof to roof nearby and laying on his stomach with a gun pointed at the rally.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thomas Matthew Crooks, the 20-year-old who shot at former president Donald Trump at a rally in Pennsylvania, had briefly appeared in a 2022 advertisement for BlackRock Inc, the world's largest money manager.</p>

<p>The ad, filmed at the Bethel Park High School in Pennsylvania, featured Crooks and several other unpaid students in the background, said the investment giant in a statement. Crooks graduated from the school in 2022.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-media-max-width="560">

<p>BlackRock said it has pulled the ad but the video will be available to authorities. The ad, however, is being widely shared by social media users.</p>

<p>"The assassination attempt on former President Trump is abhorrent. We're thankful former President Trump wasn't seriously injured, and thinking about all the innocent bystanders and victims of this awful act, especially the person who was killed," the company added in its statement.</p>

<p>BlackRock, whose earnings figures are expected today, has faced scrutiny after shooting incidents since some of its index funds own shares in gunmakers.</p>

<h2><strong>Trump Assassination Attempt</strong></h2>

<p>Trump survived an assassination attempt on Saturday after a gunman opened fire at him at a rally in Pennsylvania ahead of the Presidential elections. The attack left him with a bloodied face as the former president said the bullet pierced his "upper part of right ear".</p>

<p>A bystander died in the attack while shielding his family and Crooks - a registered Republican - was shot dead by a Secret Service sniper.</p>

<p>Trump, whose Republican candidature will be finalised today, shared a message of unity after the attack and said Americans must not allow "evil to win". "It was God alone who prevented the unthinkable from happening," he said on social media.</p>

<p>Biden, too, appealed to the nation to "lower the political temperature" in a rare Oval Office address. "Politics must never be a literal battlefield, God forbid a killing field," he said.</p>

<p>The US markets are expecting Trump trades to gain momentum after the attack. It has already been pinning hopes for the return of Republicans, especially after Biden's poor performance in last month's debate. Those trades are likely to take deeper hold as the attack sparks a wave of sympathy and support for Trump.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is tempting to draw grand conclusions from the assassination attempt on former president Donald Trump this weekend. The coarse rhetoric currently in vogue in American politics, not to mention the Capitol riot on January 6, 2021, provide plenty of fodder for this kind of speculation.</p>

<div class="theconversation-article-body">
<p>In reality, the shooting, while horrible, does not come as a total surprise in the context of American history or even in the current presidential campaign.</p>

<p>Divisive and extreme political campaigns from both parties are now the norm. Criminal prosecutions of Trump and President Joe Biden's son Hunter have become politicised. And American voters are more often driven to vote against the other party's candidate than to vote for their own.</p>

<p>Yes, activists and officials in both parties will try to use the shooting for campaign advantage by tapping into voters' emotions. Politicians will accentuate the horror of the attempted assassination and declare various phenomena as “existential threats” or use similar apocalyptic language.</p>

<p>But the overall political environment, while uncomfortable, embarrassing and occasionally deeply concerning, is not entirely unprecedented or even an extreme example of American political life.</p>

<p>To put it plainly: American politics has always been a bloody fight.</p>

<h2>A history of political violence</h2>

<p>In the <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/07/14/trump-shot-history-assassins-00168058">latter half of the 20th century</a>, one American president was assassinated (John F. Kennedy), another was wounded (Ronald Reagan) and another targeted (Gerald Ford). In addition, two major presidential candidates were assassinated (Robert F. Kennedy) or nearly so (George Wallace). Numerous other plots were disrupted.</p>

<hr />
<p><iframe class="tc-infographic-datawrapper" frameborder="0" height="400px" id="zKW4N" scrolling="no" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/zKW4N/" style="border: 0;" width="100%"></iframe></p>

<hr />
<p>American politics from the 1960s to the early 1980s were incredibly divisive and violent. During just the years 1971 and 1972, more than 2,500 politically motivated bombings <a href="https://time.com/4501670/bombings-of-america-burrough/">occurred</a> in the United States (nearly five per day), mostly from left-wing protesters against the war in Vietnam.</p>

<p>As the US has become increasingly polarised in recent years, the political environment today has become volatile again.</p>

<p>In 2011, Representative Gabby Giffords was <a href="https://www.npr.org/series/132783213/arizona-shooting-rampage-congresswoman-others-shot">shot and nearly killed</a> at an event in Arizona by a man suffering from paranoid schizophrenia. In 2017, a Bernie Sanders supporter <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2017/06/14/homepage2/james-hodgkinson-profile/index.html">shot at several Republican congressmen and staffers</a>, nearly killing Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana, now the House majority leader.</p>

<p>And of course, the Trump-instigated insurrection of the Capitol during the counting of electoral votes in the 2020 presidential election gives millions of Americans good reason to believe that Trump and his supporters remain a threat to democratic processes.</p>

<h2>Democrats' opportunity</h2>

<p>Another immediate consequence of the assassination attempt will be to turn the national conversation temporarily away from Biden's debate performance in late June. This political dilemma for Democrats, however, will not go away.</p>

<p>Given Biden's age and obvious decline, White House efforts to prop up perceptions about his fitness for office will likely not be enough to persuade his fellow Democrats he can beat Trump in November.</p>

<p>Even before the shooting, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/us/elections/polls-president.html">polls indicated</a> Biden was likely to lose the election. It will be even harder now, given the shooting will galvanise Trump's supporters and likely widen his appeal to others.</p>

<p>Many Democrats believe a different candidate – Vice President Kamala Harris or another leading Democrat – would have a better chance.</p>

<p>The Trump shooting now presents a new opportunity for Democrats to reset their campaign and make a broader appeal to American voters for calm and national unity.</p>

<p>They will need to tone down their own rhetoric about Trump's threat to democracy and instead make the case that their policy agenda is the preferred one for the American people.</p>

<p>The question is: can they quickly identify a new candidate to drive this new message? Even in the wake of Trump's near-death experience, that remains the biggest question in American politics.</p>

<h2>Republicans' challenge</h2>

<p>Trump's near-death experience will give his campaign – already based on portraying him as a victim of Democrats and the establishment – renewed energy. The pictures of Trump, with blood on his face, raising his fist in defiance after he was shot, are more valuable than hundreds of millions of dollars in campaign ads.</p>

<p>However, Republicans and fervent Trump supporters will now face a different challenge. The urge to exploit the shooting – whether the shooter was politically motivated or not – will be very difficult to resist.</p>

<p>Some Trump supporters are already blaming Democrats for the event, such as Republican <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/07/14/trump-rally-shooting-updates/eric-swalwell-jd-vance-00168103">Senator JD Vance</a>, considered a frontrunner to be Trump's vice presidential running mate.</p>

<p>House Speaker Mike Johnson and others have also <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/14/politics/biden-say-trump-shooting-bullseye/index.html#:%7E:text=%E2%80%9CPresident%20Biden%20himself%20said%20in,%E2%80%9CToday%E2%80%9D%20show%20on%20Sunday.">criticised Biden</a> for saying before the assassination that he would “put a bullseye” on Trump.</p>

<p>Politicising the shooting in this way might have success in boosting turnout of Trump supporters in November, but it could also drive further acrimony and unhinged rhetoric from those on the right.</p>

<p>For instance, any attempt to turn this tragedy into an attack on Democrats or Biden and his character could prove counterproductive and only remind voters of Trump's tendency to incite nasty divisiveness.</p>

<p>Instead, Trump has an opportunity to show real leadership and make a broader appeal to undecided and independent voters. With his base locked in more than ever, will he reach out to persuadable Republican moderates and disaffected Democrats? Can he show that he can tone down his antagonistic rhetoric and even reach across the aisle?</p>

<p><a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2011/OPINION/03/30/avlon.reagan.shooting/index.html">Reagan did so</a> – at least in tone if not his policy agenda – after he nearly died from an assassin's bullet in 1981.</p>

<p>So, can Republicans and Democrats use the tragic Trump shooting to pivot to a more positive message? American voters – as well as the US's friends and allies around the world – are no doubt hoping so.</p>

<p>The day after the shooting, Biden called Trump to express his concerns about his health and discuss the tragic event. Perhaps this small gesture of bipartisanship and civility can be an example for all in the days ahead.<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As world financial markets started to reopen after the attempted assassination of Donald Trump, one thing seemed likely: The Trump trade will get even more momentum.</p>

<p>The series of wagers - based on anticipation that the Republican's return to the White House would usher in tax cuts, higher tariffs, and looser regulations - had already been gaining ground since President Joe Biden's poor performance in last month's debate imperiled his re-election campaign.</p>

<p>But the trades were expected to take deeper hold, with Trump galvanizing supporters and drawing sympathy by exhibiting defiant resilience after being shot in the ear on stage at a Pennsylvania rally.</p>

<p>The dollar - which would gain if loose fiscal policy kept bond yields elevated - started to move higher against most peers early in Asia trading, with the Mexico peso leading the slide, weakening 0.3%. Bitcoin rose above $60,000, potentially reflecting Trump's crypto-friendly stance, while futures on the S&amp;P 500 Index for September rose 0.2% at 08:47 p.m. in New York.</p>

<p>"For us, the news does reinforce that Trump's the frontrunner," said Mark McCormick, global head of foreign-exchange and emerging-market strategy at Toronto Dominion Bank. "We remain US dollar bulls for the second half and early 2025."</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-07/9thpq1vo_gfx1_625x300_15_July_24.jpg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>To be sure, there's still plenty of room for surprises with almost four months to go in the US election campaign. The emergence of political violence may deepen concern about instability in the US and push investors into haven assets, potentially overshadowing some of the market positioning that has already taken place in the run-up to the election.</p>

<p>While future contracts on 10-year Treasury notes for September showed declines in early Asia trading, US government bonds tend to rally when investors seek temporary safety, so that may distort the Trump trade in the Treasuries market, which hinges on wagering that the yield curve will steepen as long-term bonds underperform on anticipation that Trump's fiscal and trade policies will fan inflation pressures.</p>

<p>Moreover, some investors may want to book early gains or be wary of getting deeper into an already crowded position.</p>

<p>"Political risk is binary and hard to hedge, and uncertainty was high as it is with the close nature of the race," said Priya Misra, a portfolio manager at JPMorgan Investment Management.</p>

<p>"This adds to volatility. I think it further increases the chance of a Republican sweep," she said, adding that "could put steepening pressure on the curve."</p>

<p>Equity investors are preparing for at least a near-term jump in volatility when S&amp;P 500 futures start trading at 6 p.m. in New York.</p>

<p>While traders generally don't expect Trump's assassination attempt to derail the stock-market trajectory in the long run, a pick-up in near-term price swings is likely. The market has already been contending with speculation that valuations have become too stretched, given the boom in artificial-intelligence stocks and the risks posed by elevated interest rates and political uncertainty.</p>

<p>But investors have also been anticipating that bank, health-care and oil-industry stocks would benefit from a Trump victory.</p>

<p>"The attack will boost volatility," said David Mazza, CEO at Roundhill Investments, predicting investors could seek temporary safety in defensive stocks like mega-cap companies. He said it "also adds support for stocks that do well in a steepening yield curve, especially financials."</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-07/sqh9hou_gfx2_625x300_15_July_24.jpg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>The early reaction echoes what was seen after the first presidential debate in late June, when Biden's weak performance was seen as fueling Trump's election odds.</p>

<p>The dollar advanced during that event, and investors soon began embracing a wager that involves buying shorter-maturity notes and selling longer-term ones - known as a steepener trade. That trade has been paying off, with the 30-year Treasury yields jumping to nearly 5 basis points below 2-year ones from around 37 basis points below ahead of the debate.</p>

<p>"If the market sense that Trump's chances to win are higher than they were on Friday - then we would expect the back end of the bond market to sell off in the manner we saw in the immediate aftermath of the debate," Michael Purves, CEO and founder of Tallbacken Capital Advisors, wrote in an email.</p>

<p>While bond traders have been pricing in at least two interest-rate reductions in 2024, a major boost in Trump's election odds could push the Federal Reserve toward staying on hold for longer, according to Purves.</p>

<p>"Trump's stated policies are (at least now) more inflationary than Biden's," he wrote, "and we think the Fed will want to accumulate as much dry power as possible."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President Joe Biden had just begun to turn the tables in his reelection bid when the attempt on Donald Trump's life took away his most powerful tool: drawing attention to his opponent's behavior and second-term agenda.</p>

<p>Battered by doubts about his mental fitness and pressure to step aside, Biden fought back on Friday with an energetic speech in Detroit vowing to "shine a spotlight" on Trump - an argument he planned to drive home until Election Day in November.</p>

<p>About 24 hours later, and just under 200 miles away, shots rang out at Trump's rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, the chilling apex of an era in American politics defined by radicalized views and heated rhetoric.</p>

<p>Biden's beleaguered campaign is now limited in how it can push forward. The outburst of political violence stymies his efforts to argue his case. It also threatens to undercut a core premise of his presidency - that he would restore decency and normalcy to national politics.</p>

<p>Instead, the president will hope that a unifying message in a time of crisis resonates with voters. Biden announced he would deliver a rare Oval Office address at 8 p.m. local time. He plans to call on Americans to come together and end political violence, a campaign official said.</p>

<p>"There's no place in America for this kind of violence," Biden told reporters on Sunday at the White House. "Unity is the most elusive goal of all, but nothing is as important than that right now."</p>

<p>The intense focus on the attempted assassination does offer Biden a reprieve from the conversation that had dominated headlines for weeks: whether he should withdraw after his disastrous debate. One Democratic donor, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said that they previously believed the party would be best served by replacing Biden, but there's no way that could happen now without contributing to a sense of chaos.</p>

<p>The shooting - and Trump's iconic, bloodied, fist-pumping response - seems certain to rally voters and donors behind the Republican candidate.</p>

<p>Business leaders Elon Musk and Bill Ackman, who previously resisted endorsing the former president, came out with public statements backing Trump within minutes of his being struck.</p>

<p>It will be days or weeks before public opinion surveys are released assessing the aftermath. But former President Ronald Reagan saw a substantial increase in support when he was shot and wounded in 1981. Many presidential historians say that attack cemented his status in the conservative movement.</p>

<p>By contrast, Biden must balance how to push forward without seeming insensitive.</p>

<p>The president plans to reiterate his condemnation of violence in politics on Monday in a prime-time interview with NBC News, then his political operation will pivot back to drawing contrasts between Biden's vision and Trump's, the campaign official said. Biden will not shy away from talking about the stakes of the election, and his campaign sees the tragedy in Pennsylvania as reinforcing the central thesis of his campaign, the official added.</p>

<p>The president expressed sympathy for Trump on Sunday while vowing a "thorough and swift" federal investigation, a Secret Service probe into its security measures and an independent review of the shooting that he pledged to release to the American people.</p>

<p>Biden urged people not to "make assumptions" about the gunman's "motives or his affiliations," imploring the public to "let the FBI do their job, and their partner agencies do their job."</p>

<p>With Election Day less than four months away, Biden badly needs to reverse his standing. He trails Trump by nearly 3 percentage points, according to the RealClearPolitics polling average.</p>

<p>Figures on both sides of the aisle have called for leaders to rise above the political fray and attempt to heal national divisions. The shooting confirmed the fears of half of swing-state voters, who said in a Bloomberg News/Morning Consult poll in May that they were worried about violence surrounding the election.</p>

<p>Already, the president's campaign said it would pause messaging and television ads. Biden postponed a Monday speech in Austin to mark the 60th anniversary of the Civil Rights Act. His campaign canceled a Monday event counter-programming the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee. Vice President Kamala Harris delayed political travel originally scheduled for Tuesday in Florida, according to a campaign official.</p>

<p>Biden will not be off the road for long. He plans to travel to Las Vegas to address Black and Latino advocacy groups on Tuesday and Wednesday and sit for another interview with BET, the White House said.</p>

<p><strong>Republican Criticism</strong></p>

<p>While law enforcement officials, and Trump himself, have not ascribed a motive to the shooter, some Republicans have already made unsubstantiated claims blaming Biden for motivating the would-be assassin.</p>

<p>"The central premise of the Biden campaign is that President Donald Trump is an authoritarian fascist who must be stopped at all costs," Ohio Senator J.D. Vance, a possible Trump running mate, posted on X. "That rhetoric led directly to President Trump's attempted assassination."</p>

<p>Supporters of the president pointed to his call for unity after the shooting. Biden said he had a "short but good" call with Trump.</p>

<p>The Biden campaign official denounced the criticism from some GOP lawmakers, calling politicization of the tragedy an unacceptable abdication of leadership.</p>

<p>Still, the failed assassination attempt shifts the dynamics of the race in Trump's favor.</p>

<p>It's a remarkable twist of fate for Trump, who has glorified violence throughout his political career, from encouraging rally attendees in 2016 to "knock the crap" out of protesters to telling supporters to "fight like hell" on Jan. 6, 2021, just before they stormed the US Capitol.</p>

<p>"Biden's inevitable ritual condemnation of political violence today (when it comes) will be insufficient and irrelevant," posted Vivek Ramaswamy, who ran against Trump in the 2024 GOP primaries.</p>

<p><strong>Defiant Images</strong></p>

<p>Republican pollster Frank Luntz said the shooting guarantees "every Trump voter will actually vote," while Biden won't be able to count on that certainty. The biggest effect is likely to be in battleground Pennsylvania - a must-win for Biden - because that is where the shooting occurred, he said.</p>

<p>"The long and winding road for Joe Biden just became even longer and windier," Luntz posted on X. "The shooting of Donald Trump will be significantly consequential in a way the shooter never intended."</p>

<p>With Trump dominating the national conversation, there's little Biden can do in the near term to push his anti-Trump message, mend Democratic divisions and shift the dynamics of the race in a way that reassures skeptics.</p>

<p>"This has got to help Donald Trump, at least for a while, with independents," said Matthew Wilson, a Southern Methodist University political science professor. "Those images showing a defiant Donald Trump with blood on his face and his fist in the air are better advertising than anything money can buy."</p>

<p>Others urged caution in overstating the impact of the moment. They pointed to a minimal shift in polls after other seismic events, including Biden's debate catastrophe and Trump's conviction in the New York hush-money trial.</p>

<p>Senator Bernie Sanders, a progressive stalwart, expressed confidence in Biden's chances as long as he focuses on his plans for a second term to bolster the social safety net, slash drug prices and expand workers' rights.</p>

<p>"If he continues to talk about that, I think he gets reelected," Sanders said on NBC's Meet the Press.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hours after a bullet grazed former US president Donald Trump' ear at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania on Sunday sending shockwaves throughout the country, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) identified the assassin as 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks.</p>

<p>"The FBI has identified Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20, of Bethel Park, Pennsylvania, as the subject involved in the assassination attempt of former President Donald Trump on July 13, in Butler, Pennsylvania," the FBI said in a statement.</p>

<p>The investigation agency has now released a photo of the young attacker. The image shows the 20-year-old wearing glasses and smiling into the camera.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Crooks was shot down by Secret Service snipers after he fired multiple shots at the former US president in the rally from a nearby rooftop. Witnesses claimed they tried to warn the security officials about a man moving from roof to roof nearby and laying on his stomach with a gun pointed at the rally.&nbsp;</p>

<p>An assault rifle, AR-15, was found near his body.</p>

<p>Described as a "quiet" student and a "loner", Crooks had graduated in 2022 from Bethel Park High School, and received a $500 "star award" from the National Math and Science Initiative.</p>

<p>A registered Republican, the upcoming November 5 election would have been the first time he would have voted in a presidential election.</p>

<p>His schoolmates labelled him as "socially reserved" and did not recall him ever discussing politics or Trump but mentioned that he was often bullied at school. "He was quiet but he was just bullied. He was bullied so much," a student told local US media.</p>

<p>After graduating, he had been working at a nursing home.</p>

<p>Following the attack, a "suspicious device" was found inside his car, which is now being inspected by bomb technicians. Officials are now searching through his phone.</p>

<p>The Sunday attack was a close call for Trump, who is currently in the middle of a bid to be re-elected as the President of the United States. Videos show that a last second tilt of his head saved the leader's life as the bullet clipped his ear.</p>

<p>A video showed the 78-year-old Republican leader, with blood smeared on his face, raising his fist and muttering "Fight! Fight!" as Secret Service agents whisked him off the stage after the attack.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump arrived on Sunday in Milwaukee, where he will be formally nominated as the Republican presidential candidate later this week after surviving an assassination attempt that aggravated an already bitter U.S. political divide.</p>

<p>President Joe Biden, a Democrat, ordered a review of how a 20-year-old man with an AR-15-style rifle got close enough to shoot at Trump from a rooftop on Saturday. As a former president, Trump has lifetime protection by the U.S. Secret Service.</p>

<p>Trump, 78, was holding a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania - a key state in the Nov. 5 election - when shots rang out, hitting his right ear and leaving his face streaked with blood. His campaign said he was doing well.</p>

<p>One person in the crowd was killed and two others were wounded. Secret Service agents fatally shot the suspect, the agency said.</p>

<p>Biden sought to calm the country on Sunday, delivering a brief televised address from the Oval Office in the White House.</p>

<p>"There is no place in America for this kind of violence, for any violence ever. Period. No exceptions. We can't allow this violence to be normalized," he said. "The political rhetoric in this country has gotten very heated. It's time to cool it down."</p>

<p>Trump and Biden are locked in a close election rematch, according to most opinion polls including Reuters/Ipsos. The shooting on Saturday whipsawed discussion around the campaign, which had been focused on whether Biden, 81, should drop out following a halting June 27 debate performance.</p>

<p>Trump is due to receive his party's formal nomination at the Republican National Convention, which kicks off in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on Monday. The FBI said there were no known threats to the convention or anyone attending, while the Secret Service said they do not anticipate any changes to the security plan.</p>

<p>"I was going to delay my trip to Wisconsin, and The Republican National Convention, by two days, but have just decided that I cannot allow a 'shooter,' or potential assassin, to force change to scheduling, or anything else," Trump wrote on his Truth Social site on Sunday.</p>

<p>The convention will feature televised speeches by rising Republican stars and Trump's choice for a yet-to-be-announced vice presidential running mate while highlighting the party's stance on such topics as abortion, immigration and the economy.</p>

<h3><strong>SUSPECT A NURSING HOME AIDE</strong></h3>

<p>The FBI identified Thomas Matthew Crooks of Bethel Park, Pennsylvania, as the suspect and said the shooting was being investigated as an attempted assassination.</p>

<p>FBI officials said on Sunday that the shooter acted alone. The agency said it had yet to identify an ideology linked to the suspect or any indications of mental health issues or found any threatening language on the suspect's social media accounts.</p>

<p>Crooks was a registered Republican, according to state voter records, and donated $15 to a Democratic political action committee when he was 17. At the time of the shooting, he was employed as a dietary aide at a nursing home. The Bethel Park Skilled Nursing and Rehabilitation Center said Crooks "performed his job without concern and his background check was clean."</p>

<p>The gun - an AR-style 556 rifle - had been legally bought, FBI officials said, adding they believed it had been purchased by the suspect's father. The officials said "a suspicious device" was found in the suspect's vehicle, which was inspected by bomb technicians and rendered safe.</p>

<h3><strong>SPECTATOR KILLED PROTECTING FAMILY</strong></h3>

<p>The rally attendee killed on Saturday was identified by authorities as Corey Comperatore, 50, of Sarver, Pennsylvania. He died trying to protect his family from the hail of bullets, said Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro.</p>

<p>"Corey was an avid supporter of the former president, and was so excited to be there," Shapiro said, adding, "Political disagreements can never, ever be addressed through violence."</p>

<p>Two people wounded in the shooting were in stable condition on Sunday. Pennsylvania State identified them as David Dutch, 57, of New Kensington, Pennsylvania and James Copenhaver, 74, of Moon Township, Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>The Secret Service denied accusations by some Trump supporters that it had rejected a campaign request for more security, saying that it recently "added protective resources and capabilities to the former President's security detail."</p>

<p>The shots on Saturday appeared to come from outside the area secured by the Secret Service, the agency said.</p>

<p>Hours after the assassination attempt, the Oversight Committee in the Republican-led U.S. House of Representatives summoned Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle to testify at a hearing scheduled for July 22.</p>

<p>Residents of Bethel Park, where the suspected shooter lived, expressed shock at the news on Sunday.</p>

<p>"It's a little crazy to think that somebody that did an assassination attempt is that close, but it just kind of shows the political dynamic that we're in right now with the craziness on each side," said resident Wes Morgan, 42, describing Bethel Park as "a pretty blue-collar type of area."</p>

<h3><strong>POLITICAL VIOLENCE FEARS</strong></h3>

<p>While mass shootings at schools, nightclubs and other public places are common in the United States, the attack was the first shooting of a U.S. president or major party presidential candidate since the 1981 attempted assassination of Republican President Ronald Reagan.</p>

<p>Americans fear rising political violence, Reuters/Ipsos polling shows, with two out of three respondents to a May survey saying they worried violence could follow the election.</p>

<p>After Biden defeated Trump in the 2020 election, Trump supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, in a deadly riot fueled by Trump's false claims that his loss was the result of widespread fraud.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden sent out a message of unity a day after his rival-predecessor Donald Trump survived an assassination attempt, calling on the nation to lower the temperature of hostile politics.</p>

<p>In a rare Oval Office address on Sunday, Biden maintained that fellow Americans are not enemies, but friends and co-workers who must stand together despite disagreements.</p>

<p>"I want to speak to you tonight about the need for us to lower the temperature in our politics and to remember, when we disagree, we are not enemies, we are neighbours, we are friends, co-workers, citizens and&nbsp;most importantly, we are fellow Americans. We must stand together," he said.</p>

<p>Politics must never be a literal battlefield, God forbid a killing field, he added.</p>

<p>Trump, the 78-year-old Republican whose candidature in the Presidential elections is all but finalised, was left with a bloodied face after being hit in the ear at a rally in Pennsylvania while a bystander was killed in the attack.</p>

<p>The shooter, Thomas Matthew Crooks - a registered Republican, was shot dead at the spot.</p>

<p>After the attack, Trump too shared a message of unity and said Americans must not allow "evil to win". "It was God alone who prevented the unthinkable from happening," he said on social media.</p>

<p>Biden, in a televised address from behind the historic Resolute Desk, said it's time to "cool down" the country's political record.</p>

<p>"Yesterday's shooting at Donald Trump's rally in Pennsylvania calls on all of us to take a step back, take stock of where we are, how we go forward from here...Unity is the most elusive goal of all, but nothing is important than that right now - unity," he told the nation.</p>

<p>Both sides had a responsibility to ease the situation, said the 81-year-old Democrat.</p>

<p>"We debate and disagree, we compare and contrast...but in America, we resolve our differences at the ballot box," he added.</p>

<p>Biden had earlier denounced the shooting incident in an online post, asserting there's no place in America for any kind of violence. Earlier in the day, he said he had a "short but good conversation" after the attack with Trump.</p>

<p>"As assassination attempt is contrary to everything we stand for as a nation. It's not America, and we cannot allow this to happen," he said earlier in the day.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former first lady Melania Trump said Sunday that a gunman who opened fire at a Donald Trump rally was a "monster," as she condemned the assassination attempt in which the Republican presidential candidate was injured.</p>

<p>"A monster who recognized my husband as an inhuman political machine attempted to ring out Donald's passion -- his laughter, ingenuity, love of music, and inspiration," Melania Trump said in a statement shared on X.</p>

<p>"When I watched that violent bullet strike my husband, Donald, I realized my life, and Barron's life, was on the brink of devastating change," she said, referencing the couple's 18-year-old son.</p>

<p>"I am grateful to the brave Secret Service agents and law enforcement officials who risked their own lives to protect my husband," Melania Trump said.</p>

<p>Donald Trump said he was hit in the ear when a shooter targeted an election campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania on Saturday.</p>

<p>The shooter and a bystander were killed, while two spectators were critically injured.</p>

<p>Melania Trump said she offered her "sincerest sympathy" to the families of the victims, saying: "Your need to summon your inner strength for such a terrible reason saddens me."</p>

<p>Melania, 54, has barely engaged with her husband's White House campaign, failing to appear at a single Trump rally and rarely joining him in public.</p>

<p>She has also remained largely absent during the former president's multiple court appearances in recent months to fight legal cases against him and as he cranks up his 2024 election campaign.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Following the assassination attempt on Donald Trump, US President Joe Biden addressed the nation on Sunday, stating that violence cannot be normalised at any cost and emphasising that differences in America are "resolved at ballot boxes, not with bullets."</p>

<p>In his Oval Office address Sunday evening, President Joe Biden stated that while some Americans disagree on the country's future, "politics must never be a battlefield."</p>

<p>"Disagreement is inevitable and American democracy is part of human nature...but politics must never be a literal battlefield or, God forbid, a killing field," the US President said, according to CNN.</p>

<p>Biden further said that with the election approaching, there is an "added burden on each of us to ensure that no matter how strong our convictions, we must never descend into violence."</p>

<p>He went on to say that with the Republican National Convention coming up this week, "I have no doubt they'll criticise my record and offer their own vision for this country. I'll be travelling this week, making the case for our record and vision."</p>

<p>"We debate and disagree, we compare and contrast the character of the candidates, the records, the issues, the agenda, the vision for America. But in America, we resolve our differences at the ballot box, that's how we do it, at the ballot box, not with bullets," Biden further said.</p>

<p>"The power to change America should always rest in the hands of the people, not in the hands of a would-be assassin," he said.</p>

<p>The US President further emphasised the need "to lower the temperature" in politics, CNN reported.</p>

<p>"I want to speak to you tonight about the need for us to lower the temperature in our politics and to remember, when we disagree, we are not enemies; we are neighbours, we are friends, co-workers, citizens and, most importantly, we are fellow Americans. We must stand together," Biden said in his address.</p>

<p>"Yesterday's shooting at Donald Trump's rally in Pennsylvania calls on all of us to take a step back, take stock of where we are, how we go forward from here," he added.</p>

<p>An Oval Office address is a rare occurrence. This is only the third time US President Biden has done this.</p>

<p>The last time he spoke from the Oval Office was on October 19, 2023, after Hamas attacked Israel. According to CNN, an address from the Oval Office is usually reserved for the country's most solemn and heavy moments.</p>

<p>Biden reiterated that there is no place for such violence in America, referring to the attack on Trump during his Saturday rally in Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>"There is no place in America for this kind of violence. Any violence. Period. No exceptions. We cannot allow this violence to be normalised," he said.</p>

<p>In his address, Biden also listed a number of previous attacks that have taken place in US history on various public figures. Among the attacks he cited, the January 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol and the beating of Nancy Pelosi's husband were some that he mentioned, according to CNN.</p>

<p>Trump was on stage at a campaign rally on Saturday when gunshots rang out and Secret Service agents stormed the stage.</p>

<p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) identified the gunman as Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20, from Bethel Park, Pennsylvania, with the case continuing to be under investigation.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President Joe Biden sought to calm a divided nation after his rival Donald Trump survived an assassination bid, saying in a rare Oval Office address Sunday it was time to lower the temperature of America's hostile politics.</p>

<p>"You know, the political record in this country has gotten very heated. It's time to cool it down," Biden said in the televised speech, just the third he has given from behind the historic Resolute Desk during his presidency.</p>

<p>As the country reeled from images of a bloodied Trump waving his fist after a gunman opened fire at a rally in Pennsylvania, Biden added that US politics "must never be a literal battlefield, a God forbid, a killing field."</p>

<p>The 81-year-old Democrat said that both sides had a responsibility to ease the situation ahead of a deeply polarized election that would now be a "time of testing" for the United States.</p>

<p>The short but forceful speech went without any major hitches -- bar Biden twice referring to the ballot box as a "battle box" -- with the ageing president under close scrutiny following a disastrous debate performance against Trump recently.</p>

<p>Investigators said that they were still probing the motives of 20-year-old gunman Thomas Matthew Crooks, who was shot dead by snipers at the event in Butler, Pennsylvania, on Saturday after firing multiple shots with a legally-bought semi-automatic rifle.</p>

<p>Former President Trump said on social media Sunday that Americans should not allow "evil to win," adding it was "more important than ever that we stand United."</p>

<p>The 78-year-old Republican later added on social media that it was "God alone" who had saved him. Trump's wife Melania called the shooter a "monster."</p>

<h3><strong>Security questions&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Trump was hit in the ear and left with a bloodied face by the attack, which also killed a bystander while two other people were wounded, but he managed to raise a defiant fist to the crowd as Secret Service agents bundled him away.</p>

<p>He landed later Sunday in Milwaukee for the Republican National Convention, where he will be anointed as the party's presidential nominee, with supporters believing the attack will swing voters behind him in November.</p>

<p>The US Secret Service insisted the agency is "fully prepared" to maintain security at the huge Republican gathering, and that it was not changing its protocols even after the attempt to kill Trump.</p>

<p>But the agency faces searching questions about how the shooter was able to climb onto a rooftop around 150 meters (500 feet) from where Trump was speaking and fire multiple rounds.</p>

<p>Biden said earlier that he had a "short but good conversation" after the attack with Trump.</p>

<p>Investigators are now trying to figure out what drove the shooter, with the FBI saying it believed that Crooks acted alone and had no known ideology.</p>

<p>"We are investigating this as an assassination attempt, but also looking at it as a potential domestic terrorism act," Robert Wells, assistant director of the FBI counterterrorism division, told reporters.</p>

<p>The FBI said the AR-style 556 rifle was believed to have been bought by the shooter's father, but do not yet know how he accessed the weapon or whether he took it without his father's knowledge.</p>

<p>Investigators also found a "suspicious device" in the shooter's car.</p>

<h3><strong>'Bullied'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Crooks' former schoolmates described him as a quiet student who often came across as lonely.</p>

<p>"He was quiet but he was just bullied. He was bullied so much," Jason Kohler, who said he attended the same high school as Crooks, told reporters.</p>

<p>Biden meanwhile praised the bystander who was killed, named as firefighter Corey Comperatore, saying he "was protecting his family from the bullets."</p>

<p>The attempt on Trump's life sent shock waves around the world, but the effects on a tight US presidential race in a deeply divided country are uncertain.</p>

<p>US politics have become increasingly hostile, with Trump building his image around inflammatory verbal assaults, and many Democrats expressing fury and disgust at Trump's rise.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US Secret Service was under intense scrutiny on Sunday after a gunman managed to evade its agents and open fire on former President Donald Trump at a political rally, with Republican leaders vowing swift investigations and President Joe Biden calling for an independent review.</p>

<p>The gunman, a 20-year-old Pennsylvania man, injured Trump and killed a rally attendee from a rooftop perch around 150 yards (140 m) from the stage where the former president was speaking in Butler, Pennsylvania, near Pittsburgh, officials said.</p>

<p>Trump, 78, who like other former presidents has lifetime protection by the Secret Service, was swarmed by agents who then rushed him away. Agents killed the shooter, identified by the FBI as Thomas Matthew Crooks of Bethel Park, Pennsylvania, and an AR-15-style semiautomatic was recovered near his body, officials said.</p>

<p>Trump says a bullet hit his upper right ear but that he is otherwise doing well and would travel to the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, where he will receive his party's presidential nomination.</p>

<p>Mike Johnson, speaker of the Republican-controlled US House of Representatives, said panels in the chamber will call officials from the Secret Service, the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI for hearings.</p>

<p>"The American people deserve to know the truth," Johnson said.</p>

<p>The House oversight panel called Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle to testify on July 22.</p>

<p>The Secret Service, tasked with protecting current and former presidents, is part of the Department of Homeland Security. The department's Office of the Inspector General is responsible for conducting oversight of Secret Service operations.</p>

<p>A spokesman for the inspector general's office did not respond to questions about whether it would launch its own inquiry. The FBI said in a statement following the shooting that it would be the lead federal law enforcement agency in the investigation into the shooting.</p>

<p>In a statement, Secret Service spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said the agency had "added protective resources (and) technology (and) capabilities as part of the increased campaign travel tempo."</p>

<p>Guglielmi denied accusations that the agency had rebuffed requests for more security resources from Trump's team.</p>

<p>In televised remarks, Biden, 81, said that Trump, as a former president who is the Republicans' nominee for president in the Nov. 5 election, already receives a heightened level of security.</p>

<p>"I've been consistent in my direction of the Secret Service to provide him with every resource, capability and protective measure necessary to ensure his continued safety," Biden, a Democrat, said.</p>

<p>He said he had "directed an independent review of the national security at yesterday's rally to assess exactly what happened," the results of which will be shared with the public.</p>

<p>On Sunday, Democratic Congressman Ritchie Torres said that he and Republican Congressman Mike Lawler are planning to introduce a bill that would call for enhanced security for all presidential candidates.</p>

<p><strong>'Full Rifle Kit'</strong></p>

<p>Paul Eckloff, a former Secret Service agent who retired in 2020, said agents would have surveyed all the rooftops with a line of sight ahead of time.</p>

<p>"This person either concealed themselves until they became a threat, or were not a threat until they revealed their weapons," said Eckloff.</p>

<p>In the moments after Trump was injured, the former president was quickly surrounded by Secret Service personnel who formed a human shield, while heavily armed agents in body armor and toting rifles also took to the stage and appeared to scan the area for threats.</p>

<p>Trump was whisked by the agents to a black SUV, and taken to a local hospital, according to the campaign.</p>

<p>Trump supporters blasted the Secret Service as having failed to protect the former president. Billionaire Elon Musk called for the agency's leadership to resign.</p>

<p>"How was a sniper with a full rifle kit allowed to bear crawl onto the closest roof to a presidential nominee," asked conservative activist Jack Posobiec on social media.</p>

<p>"There will be an intensive review" of the incident and "there's going to be a massive realignment," said Joseph LaSorsa, a former Secret Service agent who served on the presidential detail. "This cannot happen."</p>

<p><strong>Securing Trump Rallies</strong></p>

<p>During most of Trump's campaign stops, local police aid the Secret Service in securing the venue. Agents from other agencies within the Department of Homeland Security, such as the Transportation Security Administration, occasionally help.</p>

<p>Many Trump rallies feature thousands of audience members, take place in the open air and last for hours.</p>

<p>Before the event, agents scan the venue for bombs or other threats, and Trump invariably arrives in a fortified motorcade.</p>

<p>Law enforcement officials typically put up barriers as a perimeter, and require all attendees to go through a metal detector to enter the venue. Armed protective agents search all attendees' bags and even wallets. Many rallygoers are patted down by hand.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former US president Donald Trump landed in Milwaukee on Sunday for the Republican National Convention, a little more than 24 hours after he was wounded in a failed assassination attempt, according to his son Eric Trump.</p>

<p>"Touchdown in Milwaukee with @realdonaldtrump," Eric Trump posted on social media platform X with a video peering through the cockpit as pilots landed the Republican presidential candidate's plane, dubbed "Trump Force One."</p>

<p>People could be seen disembarking from the plane at the airport in the Wisconsin city.</p>

<p>Trump had insisted he would stick to his schedule for the convention despite Saturday's shooting at a rally in Pennsylvania which left one bystander dead, two wounded, and Trump himself nicked in the ear by what he said was a "whizzing" bullet.</p>

<p>"I cannot allow a 'shooter,' or potential assassin, to force change to scheduling, or anything else," the presumptive Republican presidential nominee said earlier Sunday on Truth Social.</p>

<p>"Therefore, I will be leaving for Milwaukee, as scheduled, at 3:30 P.M. TODAY," he wrote, adding that he opted against delaying his trip to Wisconsin.</p>

<p>Republicans are expected to confirm Trump as their nominee to challenge Democrat incumbent Joe Biden for the White House in November.</p>

<p>Trump is also expected to announce his running mate as early as the opening day on Monday.</p>

<p>He formally accepts the nomination on Thursday in a speech that will be followed by millions, closing the convention by ushering in "a new golden age for America," according to his campaign.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The gunman who shot at former president Donald Trump during an election rally in Pennsylvania on Saturday appears to have acted alone, according to the FBI, which is investigating it as a potential "domestic terrorism" act.</p>

<p>The gunman has been identified as Thomas Matthew Crooks (20).</p>

<p>"At this point in the investigation, it appears that he was a lone actor, but we still have more investigation to go," said Robert Wells, the executive assistant director of the FBI's National Security Branch.</p>

<p>The FBI, he said, is investigating this as an assassination attempt," and also as a "potential domestic terrorism act." The counterterrorism division and criminal divisions are working jointly together to determine the motive, he added.</p>

<p>The FBI is leading the investigation into the assassination attempt of Trump at an election rally in Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>Trump was hit with a bullet that pierced the upper part of his right ear. He is now safe and is continuing with his schedule that includes travelling to Milwaukee to attend the Republican National Convention, which would formally nominate him as the party's presidential nominee against incumbent Joe Biden.</p>

<p>"The shooter may be deceased, but the investigation is very much ongoing. And, because of that, we are limited in what we say at this point," FBI Director Christopher Wray said.</p>

<p>"What we witnessed yesterday was nothing short of an attack on democracy and our democratic process," he told reporters at a news conference in Washington DC.</p>

<p>According to an FBI official, the investigation into the gunman at Donald Trump's rally Saturday has not yet turned up any mental health issues, threatening posts or other motives, but cautioned it was still early.</p>

<p>The shooter, as per FBI, used an AR-style rifle chambered in 5.56mm, a common calibre for such weapons.</p>

<p>The New York Times said authorities were scouring the gunman's social media and other property as they sought to determine a motive for the attack.</p>

<p>Biden is likely to address the nation at 8 pm from the Oval Office. He will give "a forceful and needed address to update the nation on the horrifying attack on Donald Trump and the need for every American to come together to not just condemn, but put to an end political violence in this country once and for all," a campaign official told the daily.</p>

<p>Crooks graduated from the Community College of Allegheny County two months ago, earning an associate degree in engineering science, school officials said in a statement, adding that they were "shocked and saddened by the horrific turn of events." Kimberly Cheatle, the director of the Secret Service, in a memo to her agents said "the attempted assassination of former President Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, is a moment that will forever be remembered in history."</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

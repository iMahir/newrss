       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Among the five people who have been charged in <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/took-advantage-of-his-addiction-5-charged-over-matthew-perrys-death-6345973">actor Matthew Perry</a>'s death due to a drug overdose last year is a woman called Jasveen Sangha, popularly known as "the Ketamine Queen". According to investigators, Ms Sangha provided the lethal dose of ketamine that led to Mr Perry's death.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ms Sangha, a 41-year-old dual British and American citizen, has been under the radar of federal authorities for her involvement in the distribution of dangerous narcotics. Dubbed the "Ketamine Queen of Los Angeles," Ms Sangha allegedly ran a drug operation out of her North Hollywood home, where officials claim she stored, packaged, and distributed various narcotics. According to a federal indictment, her residence was described as a "drug-selling emporium" filled with methamphetamine, cocaine, and prescription drugs like Xanax.</p>

<p>Ms Sangha's operation, which dates back to at least June 2019, came under scrutiny after she was busted in March for selling methamphetamine in an unrelated case. During the raid on her home, federal agents seized 79 bottles of liquid ketamine and nearly 2,000 meth pills, highlighting the scale of her illicit activities.</p>

<p>Mr Perry died on October 28 last year. The 'Friends' actor, who had long battled addiction, was found in his home, with his death attributed to a ketamine overdose. According to investigators, Mr Perry had obtained the fatal batch of ketamine through a broker, Eric Fleming, who in turn sourced the drug from Ms Sangha.</p>

<p>According to court documents, Ms Sangha provided Mr Fleming with 50 vials of ketamine in two separate deals in the weeks leading up to Mr Perry's death. The indictment alleges that Mr Perry first sampled the drug on October 13, and Mr Fleming subsequently delivered two large batches to Mr Perry's home on October 14 and October 24. Ms Sangha even included "ketamine lollipops" as a bonus due to the size of Mr Perry's order.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The White House on Thursday condemned what it called "unacceptable" attacks on Palestinians by Jewish settlers, after one person was killed and another wounded in a village in the occupied West Bank.</p>

<p>"Attacks by violent settlers against Palestinian civilians in the West Bank are unacceptable and must stop," a National Security Council spokesperson said in a statement.</p>

<p>"Israeli authorities must take measures to protect all communities from harm, this includes intervening to stop such violence, and holding all perpetrators of such violence to account."</p>

<p>The Palestinian health ministry said a 23-year-old man was killed and another suffered critical gunshot wounds to the chest in the attack on the village of Jit, west of Nablus.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said "dozens of Israeli civilians, some of them masked," had entered Jit and "set fire to vehicles and structures in the area, hurled rocks and Molotov cocktails."</p>

<p>Israeli President Isaac Herzog condemned the incident.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United States on Thursday announced its approval of a $5 billion sale of up to 600 Patriot missiles and related equipment to Germany, which has donated several of the advanced air defense systems to Ukraine.</p>

<p>The proposed sale of the PAC-3 MSE missiles "will support the foreign policy and national security of the United States by improving the security of a NATO ally that is an important force for political and economic stability in Europe," the Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) said in a statement.</p>

<p>It "will improve Germany's capability to meet current and future threats and increase the defensive capabilities of its military. It will support Germany's goal of improving national and territorial defense as well as interoperability with US and NATO forces," the statement added.</p>

<p>The State Department approved the possible sale of the missiles to Germany, and the DSCA on Thursday provided the required notification to Congress, which still needs to sign off on the transaction.</p>

<p>Germany has donated several Patriot systems to Ukraine, which has faced repeated Russian missile barrages and drone attacks targeting its infrastructure, leaving it in desperate need of additional air defenses.</p>

<p>After the outbreak of the Ukraine war in 2022, Berlin dropped a traditionally pacifist stance and has become Kyiv's second-biggest supplier of military aid, after Washington.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ukraine on Thursday claimed fresh advances in its offensive into Russia, saying it had seized over &nbsp;1,100 square kilometres in the biggest attack by a foreign army on Russian soil since World War II.</p>

<p>Russia said it had recaptured a first village from Ukrainian forces in the Kursk border region and announced it was sending "additional forces" to the neighbouring Belgorod region.</p>

<p>Ukraine said it now controlled dozens of settlements and Sudzha, a town eight kilometres (five miles) from the border.</p>

<p>"We have taken control of 1,150 square kilometres of territory and 82 settlements," said top military commander Oleksandr Syrsky.</p>

<p>Ukrainian troops launched the offensive on August 6, breaking months of setbacks for the army that has been battling a Russian invasion for more than two years.</p>

<p>The top general also told President Volodymyr Zelensky the army had set up an administrative office "to maintain law and order and meet the priority needs of the population in the controlled territories".</p>

<p>Zelensky announced "the completion of the liberation of the town of Sudzha from the Russian military".</p>

<p><br />
<strong>- 120,000 Russians displaced -</strong><br />
At an Orthodox church in the centre of Sumy, the regional hub across the border from Kursk, dozens of mourners gathered Thursday to pay their final respects to six Ukrainian soldiers killed in the offensive.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Tearful family members received a steady stream of friends and relatives wearing black and clutching wreaths as the priest intoned a funeral mass and incense hung in the air.</p>

<p>"It is hard to say goodbye to them, because we want them to live forever, to live among us as honoured sons of their homeland," the priest told mourners.</p>

<p>"Our task is to pray for our heroic fighters and their families."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pallbearers lifted the coffins one by one for burial as a choir sang hymns. Air raid sirens echoed over Sumy as the service ended.</p>

<p>In Kursk, AFP reporters saw around 500 evacuees from border areas queueing for food and clothes being distributed by the Russian Red Cross.</p>

<p><br />
<strong>- 'Completed destruction' -</strong><br />
The assault took Russian troops by surprise and triggered mass evacuations. Russia says more than 120,000 people have left or been evacuated.</p>

<p>The fighting has killed at least 12 civilians and wounded 121 others according to Russian authorities, who have not released a toll since Monday.</p>

<p>Moscow scrambled reinforcements and announced the recapture of a first village in the Kursk region on Thursday.</p>

<p>Russia's defence ministry said the army had "completed destruction of the enemy and restored control of the settlement of Krupets".</p>

<p>The Russian army also announced measures to prevent attacks on neighbouring regions, particularly Belgorod.</p>

<p>Russia has prepared "concrete actions" to defend Belgorod from Ukrainian attacks, Defence Minister Andrei Belousov said at a meeting with officials including Belgorod governor Vyacheslav Gladkov.</p>

<p>They include "the allocation of additional forces".</p>

<p>Kursk and Belgorod have seen small incursions since President Vladimir Putin launched Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, but nothing on this scale.</p>

<p><br />
<strong>- Intensity of attacks -</strong><br />
Ukrainian officials have argued the offensive was an act of "self-defence" and experts suggest it could be aimed at alleviating pressure from the eastern front.</p>

<p>Ukrainian troops are still struggling in the eastern Donbas region, a key Russian target.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Most Russian attacks are taking place" in the Donbas, Zelensky said, adding: "We are paying maximum defensive attention."</p>

<p>Local authorities in three Ukrainian regions reported at least five civilian deaths in Russian strikes, including Donetsk in the east, Kharkiv in the northeast and Kherson in the south.<br />
\<br />
Russia said its forces had captured Ivanivka in Donetsk, a frontline village just 15 kilometres from the Kyiv-held transport hub of Pokrovsk in east Ukraine.</p>

<p>Pokrovsk lies on the intersection of a key road that supplies Ukrainian troops and towns across the eastern front and has long been a Russian target.<br />
In a briefing, Russia's defence ministry said its army had "liberated the &nbsp;village of Ivanovka", using the Russian name for the village.</p>

<p>Russian forces have been inching towards Pokrovsk for months, taking a string of villages on the way to the city outskirts.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The United States hailed a "promising start" to Gaza ceasefire talks Thursday, as pressure mounted for a deal to halt the spread of a war that the Hamas-run territory's health ministry said has killed 40,005.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United States hailed a "promising start" to Gaza ceasefire talks Thursday, as pressure mounted for a deal to halt the spread of a war that the Hamas-run territory's health ministry said has killed 40,005.</p>

<p>The conflict sparked by Hamas's unprecedented October 7 attack on Israel has devastated Gaza, displaced nearly all of its population at least once and triggered a towering humanitarian crisis.</p>

<p>Talks involving CIA director William Burns opened in the Qatari capital Doha, US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said.</p>

<p>"Today is a promising start," Kirby told reporters in Washington, adding: "There remains a lot of work to do."</p>

<p>The talks were expected to continue on Friday, he said.</p>

<p>Hamas official Osama Hamdan said the movement did not take part in Thursday's meeting but stood ready to join the indirect negotiations if they produced new commitments from Israel.</p>

<p>The Palestinian group has demanded the implementation of a truce plan laid out in late May by US President Joe Biden.</p>

<p>"If the mediators succeed in forcing the (Israeli) occupation to agree, we would, but so far there's nothing new," Hamdan told AFP.</p>

<p>He said Hamas would not take part in protracted negotiations that "give (Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin) Netanyahu more time to kill the Palestinian people".</p>

<p>So far, there has been only one truce in November, when Gaza militants released 105 hostages seized in the October 7 attack, the Israelis among them in exchange for 240 Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.</p>

<p>The latest diplomatic push comes as the health ministry in Gaza said the death toll in the besieged Palestinian territory had surpassed 40,000 -- which UN chief Antonio Guterres said was "yet another reason" why a ceasefire was needed now.</p>

<p>"Given the... disturbing number of people who remain unaccounted for, who may be trapped or dead under the rubble, this number may, if anything, be an undercount," his spokesman Farhan Haq said.</p>

<p>"This is yet another reason why we need to have a ceasefire now, as well as the release of all hostages and unimpeded humanitarian assistance."</p>

<p>The Gaza health ministry, which does not provide a breakdown of civilian and militant casualties, said the tally included 40 deaths in the previous 24 hours.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said it had killed "more than 17,000" Palestinian militants in Gaza since the war began.</p>

<p><strong>- 'Time is now' -</strong><br />
British foreign minister David Lammy and his French counterpart Stephane Sejourne are to discuss the truce talks with Israel's top diplomat Israel Katz on Friday.</p>

<p>In Beirut on Wednesday, visiting US envoy Amos Hochstein said a deal in Gaza "would also help enable a diplomatic resolution here in Lebanon and that would prevent an outbreak of a wider war".</p>

<p>"We have to take advantage of this window for diplomatic action and diplomatic solutions. That time is now," he added.</p>

<p>Hamas's October 7 attack on southern Israel triggered the war and resulted in the deaths of 1,198 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures.</p>

<p>Militants also seized 251 people, 111 of whom are still held in Gaza, including 39 the military says are dead.</p>

<p>Mediation efforts have repeatedly stalled since the week-long truce in November.</p>

<p>Hamas officials, some analysts and critics in Israel have said Netanyahu has sought to prolong the war for political gain.</p>

<p>Israeli media this week quoted Defence Minister Yoav Gallant as privately telling a parliamentary committee that a hostage release deal "is stalling... in part because of Israel".</p>

<p>Netanyahu's office accused Gallant of adopting an "anti-Israel narrative" and said Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar is "the only obstacle to a hostage deal".</p>

<p>- Bloodied children -<br />
The latest mediation push follows the July 31 killing of Sinwar's predecessor, Hamas political leader and truce negotiator Ismail Haniyeh. His killing during a visit to Tehran sent fears of a wider conflagration soaring.</p>

<p>Iran and its regional allies blamed Israel and vowed retaliation. Israel has not claimed responsibility for the attack.</p>

<p>Western leaders have urged Tehran to avoid hitting Israel over Haniyeh's killing, which came hours after an Israeli strike in Beirut killed Hezbollah's military commander.</p>

<p>Fallout from the conflict has drawn in Iran-aligned groups from Lebanon, Yemen, Iraq and Syria.</p>

<p>More than 370 Hezbollah members have been killed in 10 months of near daily cross-border fire with Israeli forces, according to an AFP tally, more than the Iran-backed movement lost in the 2006 war with Israel.</p>

<p>On the Israeli side, 22 soldiers and 26 civilians have been killed, including in the annexed Golan Heights, according to military figures.</p>

<p>In Gaza, where the war has destroyed much of the territory's housing and other infrastructure, relatively few deaths were reported on Thursday.</p>

<p>In the deadliest bombardment, emergency services said air strikes killed five people in Gaza City.</p>

<p>Israel's military said troops had killed about 20 militants in Rafah, southern Gaza.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, dead and wounded including bloodied children arrived at Nasser Hospital in the southern city of Khan Yunis after an Israeli strike.</p>

<p>"I was not pro-Hamas but now I support them and I want to fight," one grieving man shouted.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[Donald Trump will hold a press conference at his New Jersey golf club on Thursday, his latest effort to steal the spotlight back from Democratic rival Kamala Harris, who has dominated headlines since her late entry into the race.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Republican U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump will hold a press conference at his New Jersey golf club on Thursday, his latest effort to steal the spotlight back from Democratic rival Kamala Harris, who has dominated headlines since her late entry into the race.</p>

<p>Trump's event is aimed at drawing a contrast with Vice President Harris, who has rarely taken questions from reporters since replacing President Joe Biden at the top of the Democratic ticket in late July. Harris has said she plans to do her first formal press interview by the end of the month.</p>

<p>Trump held a similar press event at his Florida resort last week, where he spoke for more than an hour, bashing Harris over immigration and the economy and falsely claiming that his campaign crowds have been much larger than hers.</p>

<p>The Harris campaign sent out a mock "media advisory" for Trump's press conference on Thursday with the headline, "Donald Trump to Ramble Incoherently and Spread Dangerous Lies in Public, but at Different Home," a reference to his Bedminster estate.</p>

<p>Hours earlier, the Trump campaign announced five hires, including Corey Lewandowski, who served as Trump's first campaign manager during his successful 2016 campaign. Lewandowski voiced his excitement on joining the campaign, posting on X: "Let Trump, Be Trump!"</p>

<p>It was not immediately clear what those additions would mean for the campaign's day-to-day operations and hierarchy. One campaign official, who requested anonymity to discuss internal personnel matters, said the campaign needed more "soldiers" in the race's closing months and that the hires were not indicative of any broader shakeup.</p>

<p>"Corey Lewandowski, Taylor Budowich, Alex Pfeiffer, Alex Bruesewitz, and Tim Murtaugh are all veterans of prior Trump campaigns and their unmatched experience will help President Trump prosecute the case against Kamala Harris and Tim Walz, the most radical ticket in American history," Trump co-campaign managers Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles said in a statement.</p>

<p>Budowich was most recently the executive director of MAGA Inc, the main outside super PAC supporting Trump's bid, while Pfeiffer served as the communications director there. It is common for staff to move between campaigns and their affiliated super PACs, as it can allow each organization to have greater visibility into the other operations. Legally, campaigns and super PACs have limits on how much they can coordinate.</p>

<p>Bruesewitz is a pro-Trump political consultant known for his social media savvy, and Murtaugh was communications director of Trump's unsuccessful 2020 bid.</p>

<p>Lewandowski was forced out of Trump's 2016 bid in the months before the election, though Trump later said he regretted it. Lewandowski was later forced out of a pro-Trump super PAC in 2021 after a donor's wife accused him of unwanted sexual advances.</p>

<p>Trump intends to use Thursday's press conference to criticize Harris over inflation and the economy, a campaign official said.</p>

<p>His campaign event in North Carolina on Wednesday also was billed as being focused on the economy, but Trump veered a number of times into other topics and personal attacks on Harris.</p>

<p>Harris is scheduled to deliver a speech on economic policy on Friday in North Carolina.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel is to build the first West Bank settlement since 2017, announced the Israeli Civil Administration, the country's governing body that operates in the West Bank, local media reported.</p>

<p>Nahal Heletz, the new settlement, will cover approximately 148 acres (about 600,000 square metres) southwest of Jerusalem, near the Palestinian city of Bethlehem, reports Xinhua news agency, quoting the Times of Israel.</p>

<p>Peace Now, an organisation opposing the settlements, warned that Nahal Heletz "will be an enclave in a Palestinian zone and will bring about friction and security challenges."</p>

<p>It said Nahal Heletz is designed to disrupt Palestinian territorial continuity and argued that it contributes to Israel's "de facto annexation" of the West Bank.</p>

<p>It also pointed out that the settlement will be built on land that belongs to Battir, a Palestinian village known for its ancient agricultural terraces recognised as a UNESCO World Heritage site.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US prosecutors said Thursday they have charged five people, including two doctors, over the death of "Friends" star Matthew Perry, who died at his Los Angeles home last year after years of struggling with addiction.</p>

<p>"These defendants took advantage of Mr Perry's addiction issues to enrich themselves. They knew what they were doing was wrong. They knew what they were doing was risking great danger to Mr Perry, but they did it anyway," said US Attorney Martin Estrada.</p>

<p>The five include two doctors and the actor's assistant.</p>

<p>"In the end, these defendants were more interested in profiting off Mr Perry than caring for his well-being."</p>

<p>One of the doctors, Salvador Plasencia, faces up to 120 years in federal prison, Estrada said.</p>

<p>Matthew&nbsp;Perry, who played the character Chandler Bing on the hit TV sitcom from 1994-2004, was found unresponsive in his swimming pool in October last year at the age of 54, sparking a global outpouring of grief from fans and colleagues.</p>

<p>An autopsy found the cause of his death was "the acute effects of ketamine," a controlled drug which the recovering addict was understood to be taking as part of supervised therapy.</p>

<p>While only small amounts were found in his stomach, a high level was detected in his bloodstream.</p>

<p>Just how the actor -- who had reportedly not had a supervised infusion session for several days -- obtained the drug became the subject of a legal investigation, with Los Angeles police confirming in May that they were probing the death.</p>

<p>Doctors and veterinarians often employ ketamine as an anesthetic, and researchers have explored its use as a treatment for depression. Underground users take it illicitly for its hallucinogenic effects.</p>

<p>"Friends," which followed the lives of six New Yorkers navigating adulthood, dating and careers, drew a massive global following and made megastars of previously unknown actors who became a fixture in the lives of millions of viewers.</p>

<p>One of the biggest draws was Matthew&nbsp;Perry's Chandler character, a sarcastic 20-something-year-old who resisted growing up.</p>

<p>Matthew&nbsp;Perry's comic talent brought him fabulous wealth, but hid a darkness that left him struggling with addiction to painkillers and alcohol.</p>

<p>In 2018 he suffered a burst colon, related to drug usage, and underwent multiple surgeries.</p>

<p>In his memoir "Friends, Lovers and the Big Terrible Thing," published in 2022, Matthew&nbsp;Perry described going through detox dozens of times. He dedicated the book to "all of the sufferers out there," and wrote in the prologue: "I should be dead."</p>

<p>"I have mostly been sober since 2001," he wrote, "save for about sixty or seventy little mishaps over the years."</p>

<p>His sudden death last year drew shocked reactions from Hollywood A-listers, his costars, and "Friends" fans worldwide.</p>

<p>"Oh boy this one has cut deep," said Jennifer Aniston, who played Rachel on the show.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Kim Dotcom, who is facing criminal charges relating to the defunct file-sharing website Megaupload, will be extradited to the United States from New Zealand, the New Zealand justice minister said on Thursday.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kim Dotcom, who is facing criminal charges relating to the defunct file-sharing website Megaupload, will be extradited to the United States from New Zealand, the New Zealand justice minister said on Thursday.</p>

<p>German-born Dotcom, who has New Zealand residency, has been fighting extradition to the United States since 2012 following a FBI-ordered raid on his Auckland mansion.</p>

<p>Justice Minister Paul Goldsmith signed an extradition order for Dotcom, a spokesperson for the Minister of Justice said</p>

<p>"I considered all of the information carefully, and have decided that Mr Dotcom should be surrendered to the U.S. to face trial," Goldsmith said in a statement.</p>

<p>"As is common practice, I have allowed Mr Dotcom a short period of time to consider and take advice on my decision. I will not, therefore, be commenting further at this stage."</p>

<p>In a post on social media website X on Tuesday, Dotcom said "the obedient US colony in the South Pacific just decided to extradite me for what users uploaded to Megaupload", in what appears to be a reference to the extradition order.</p>

<p>Reuters could not immediately contact Dotcom for a response.</p>

<p>U.S. authorities say Dotcom and three other Megaupload executives cost film studios and record companies more than $500 million by encouraging paying users to store and share copyrighted material, which generated more than $175 million in revenue for the website.</p>

<p>The company's chief marketing officer Finn Batato and chief technical officer and co-founder Mathias Ortmann, both from Germany, along with a third executive Dutch national Bram van der Kolk were arrested with Dotcom in 2012.</p>

<p>Ortmann and van der Kolk entered plea deals that saw them sentenced in 2023 to jail terms in New Zealand but allowed them to avoid extradition. Batato died in 2022 in New Zealand.</p>

<p>At least one person has been arrested in connection with the ketamine overdose death last year of "Friends" actor Matthew Perry, US media reported Thursday.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An mpox outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo has killed 548 people since the start of the year, with all provinces affected by the virus, the health minister said on Thursday in a statement.</p>

<p>The World Health Organization (WHO) on Wednesday declared the mpox surge in Africa a global public health emergency, worried by the rise in cases in DRC and the spread to nearby countries.</p>

<p>"According to the latest epidemiological report, our country has recorded 15,664 potential cases and 548 deaths since the beginning of the year," Health Minister Samuel-Roger Kamba said in a separate video message seen by AFP on Thursday.</p>

<p>The DRC is made up of 26 provinces and has a population of around 100 million.</p>

<p>The most affected provinces are South Kivu, North Kivu, Tshopo, Equateur, North Ubangi, Tshuapa, Mongala and Sankuru, Kamba said.</p>

<p>The UN health agency's decision came the day after the African Union's health watchdog declared its own public health emergency over the growing outbreak.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A new poll conducted by real estate company Clever has found Washington DC to be the least desirable city in America.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A new poll conducted by real estate company Clever has found Washington DC to be the least desirable city in America. For the study, the firm polled 1,000 people in June and analysed migration data from the US Census to uncover why the US capital city has fallen out of favour. It found that for the second year, Washington DC topped the list of places where Americans would least want to live, with a whopping 33% of survey respondents ranking it among the top five worst cities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/08/14/real-estate/this-city-has-been-declared-americas-most-hated-again/"><em>New York Post,</em></a> the study found that a staggering 65% of Americans said that sky-high living costs make a place unlivable, with Washington DC being no exception. The city's reputation has also taken a hit due to a surge in crime, with 2023 seeing 274 murders, which is the highest number in over two decades, the outlet reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>New York, Los Angeles and San Fransico also landed on the list of least desirable cities this year. According to the study, this is largely due to their unaffordable housing markets.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Washington DC, however, was crowned the best place for working parents, thanks to its high scores in work and health categories, remote work opportunities and a strong network of paediatricians.</p>

<p>Other cities which were once thriving are struggling, per the study. Baltimore, now known for leading the country in murders and robberies, ranks seventh on the least desirable list. Detroit, plagued by high rates of rape and aggravated assault, is also mentioned on the list. Birmingham, Alabama, and Buffalo, New York, are also grappling with the fallout from crumbling industrial infrastructure.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On the other hand, Tampa, Florida, has been crowned America's most desirable city for 2024. However, Americans are content where they are, with 73% saying they're happy with their current home. Yet, frustration lingers for many, with 59% feeling dissatisfied and 43% even embarrassed by their state, the study said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to the <em>Post</em>, California has fallen out of favour, coming in last in a recent Consumer Affairs poll due to poor marks in education, health and safety. The once-Golden State has also lost its luster, with New Mexico, Texas, Louisiana and Alaska trailing close behind in the rankings.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Bangladesh's International Crimes Tribunal has started an investigation against former PM Sheikh Hasina and nine others on charges of genocide and crimes against humanity that took place from July 15 to August 5 during the students' mass movement.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bangladesh's International Crimes Tribunal has started an investigation against former prime minister Sheikh Hasina and nine others on charges of genocide and crimes against humanity that took place from July 15 to August 5 during the students' mass movement against her government.</p>

<p>A complaint was filed on Wednesday with the investigation agency of Bangladesh's International Crimes Tribunal against Ms Hasina, Awami League general secretary and former road transport and bridges minister Obaidul Quader, former home minister Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal, and several other prominent figures within the party.</p>

<p>The complainant's lawyer Gazi MH Tamim confirmed on Thursday that the tribunal started the probe on Wednesday night.</p>

<p>Ms Hasina, 76, fled to India on August 5 after resigning from her post amidst unprecedented anti-government protests led by students.</p>

<p>The Hasina-led Awami League along with its affiliated organisations is also named in the petition.</p>

<p>The petition was filed by Bulbul Kabir, the father of Arif Ahmed Siam, a Class IX student who was killed during the anti-discrimination student movement.</p>

<p>“The (ICT-BD) investigation agency has started reviewing the charges... The accusation of genocide and crimes against humanity has been recorded as a case,” said the lawyer.</p>

<p>The application accuses Ms Hasina and others of orchestrating a violent crackdown on student protesters, resulting in widespread casualties and human rights violations.</p>

<p>He said the progress of this investigation outcome would be communicated to the tribunal - originally constituted to try the Bengali-speaking hardened collaborators of Pakistani troops during the 1971 Liberation War - within seven days.</p>

<p>He said that in line with the tribunal law, reports published in various media from July 16 to August 6 were submitted as necessary documents.</p>

<p>Separately, a case of enforced disappearance was filed on Wednesday against Ms Hasina and several others, including former ministers of her cabinet, on the charge of kidnapping a lawyer in 2015.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, a Dhaka court on Thursday asked police to submit by September 15 the probe report of the case filed against Ms Hasina and six others over the death of grocery shop owner Abu Saeed in police firing in the capital's Mohammadpur area during the quota protests on July 19.</p>

<p>Dhaka Metropolitan Magistrate Md Zaki Al Farabi set the date after the case was placed before his court for the next course of action.</p>

<p>The development coincided with the now scrapped National Mourning Day holiday marking the August 15, 1975, assassination of Ms Hasina's father and Bangladesh's founder Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.</p>

<p>The interim government of Nobel Laureate Professor Muhammad Yunus cancelled the holiday after discussions with different political parties.</p>

<p>According to media reports, some parties were in favour of keeping the mourning day holiday while others opposed it.</p>

<p>Unlike the previous years, no sombre wreath offering ceremony was held at Bangabandhu's 32 Dhanmandi private residence, later turned into a memorial museum, which was set ablaze by angry mobs after Ms Hasina resigned and fled to India.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Nobody approves of it... but somebody's (Ms Hasina's regime) overdoing caused the overreaction,” ex-premier Khaleda Zia's Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) leader and spokesman Amir Khasru Mahmud Chowdhury earlier told PTI, referring to the attack on the museum.</p>

<p><strong>'She Is Responsible'</strong></p>

<p>Political commentator and New Age newspaper editor Nurul Kabir, known for his stern criticism of the past regime, said Ms Hasina herself was responsible for the defamation of her father.</p>

<p>Mr Kabir added, “Who can deny his contribution to Bangladesh's creation".</p>

<p>“The blame lies with them (Ms Hasina's regime or party),” he said.</p>

<p>Reports and witnesses said film actress Rokeya Prachi and several others tried to go to the museum to stage a sit-in but were dispersed by protesters.</p>

<p>A huge group of stick-wielding people on Thursday positioned themselves in front of the museum to bar anyone from paying tributes in front of Mujibur Rahman's bust at Bangabandhu Bhaban.</p>

<p>"I went to pay my respects in the morning. But I could not place wreaths,” said a 1971 veteran and leader of Krishak Sramik Awami League, a party belonging to the opposition camp. He complained that brickbats were thrown at his car, damaging the vehicle.</p>

<p>The student-led protests demanding reforms in government job quotas evolved into a government-toppling movement in early August.</p>

<p>Over 230 people died in Bangladesh in the incidents of violence that erupted across the country following the fall of the Hasina government on August 5, taking the number of people killed to 560 during the three weeks of violence.</p>

<p>Following Ms Hasina's resignation, a caretaker government led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus was formed in the country, promising to address administrative and political reforms and hold those involved in the violence accountable</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The wife of late Russian dissident Alexei Navalny said on Thursday that investigators had told her his death in an Arctic prison colony in February was caused by a "combination of diseases" - a finding she rejected as preposterous.</p>

<p>Yulia Navalnaya said she would demand a criminal investigation of her husband's death, which she considers to be murder, and that Navalny's team would continue to conduct its own probe.</p>

<p>Navalny, 47, died suddenly on Feb. 16, depriving the Russian opposition of its most charismatic and popular leader. He had been serving sentences totalling more than 30 years on charges he said were rigged in order to silence his criticism of President Vladimir Putin.</p>

<p>The Kremlin has strongly rejected his supporters' accusation that Putin had him murdered.</p>

<p>Posting on social media, Yulia Navalnaya published a copy of a three-page official letter she received last week stating there were no criminal circumstances surrounding her husband's death and therefore no grounds to open an investigation.</p>

<p>The letter was signed by Alexander Varapayev, the same investigative official who, according to Navalnaya, initially refused to hand over her husband's body to his mother unless she agreed to have him buried in secret - a demand she rejected.</p>

<p>The letter said Navalny had fallen ill suddenly while walking in a prison yard, and was taken to a medical unit where staff tried unsuccessfully to save him with "indirect heart massage and artificial respiration". An emergency team was sent for, but was also unable to revive him.</p>

<p>Navalnaya said that version was a lie and a cover-up.</p>

<p>"We know very well that when Alexei became ill, he was taken not to the medical unit, but back to the punishment cell. That he was dying there, alone. That he was taken to the medical unit already unconscious. That in the last minutes before his death he complained of acute pain in his stomach. Why is all this not in the resolution of the Investigative Committee?" she wrote.</p>

<p>She did not say how she and her husband's supporters had established the sequence of events she described.</p>

<p><strong>LIST OF DISEASES</strong></p>

<p>The official letter said the cause of Navalny's death was a "combination of diseases" which it presented as a long list, ranging from hypertension and pancreatitis to damage to his vertebrae and the presence of herpes virus in his lungs and spleen.</p>

<p>It said the trigger for his death was a critical increase in blood pressure that had upset the rhythm of his heart and overloaded the pressure in its chambers.</p>

<p>Navalnaya said "every third person in Russia" had chronic diseases of the kind listed by the report, and "people don't die suddenly from something like that in the space of an hour". She also challenged the diagnosis of heart arrhythmia.</p>

<p>"Tell me, how did you discover this arrhythmia during the autopsy? Heart rhythm disturbances cannot be determined posthumously, and during his lifetime Alexei did not have any heart diseases," she said.</p>

<p>She said Navalny had been lively and cheerful when he appeared by video link at a court hearing on the eve of his death. And if he had really been suffering from so many diseases, she demanded, then "why was such a sick person sent to a punishment cell and kept there for months?"</p>

<p>Navalnaya demanded the opening of a criminal case, though she said there would be no investigation as long as Putin remained in power.</p>

<p>"Therefore, we will continue to investigate ourselves," she wrote, urging prison staff and officials to contact her team confidentially and promising to pay for any new information.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A new round of Gaza ceasefire talks was underway in the Qatari capital Doha on Thursday afternoon, an offical briefed on the meeting told Reuters, with Israel's spy chief joining his U.S. and Egyptian counterparts and Qatar's prime minister for the closed-door meeting.</p>

<p>The talks, an effort to end 10 months of fighting in the Palestinian enclave and bring 115 Israeli and foreign hostages home, were put together as Iran appeared on the point of retaliating against Israel following the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran on July 31.</p>

<p>With U.S. warships, submarines and warplanes dispatched to the region to defend Israel and deter potential attackers, Washington is hoping a ceasefire agreement in Gaza can defuse the risk of a full-out wider regional war.</p>

<p>Hamas officials, who have accused Israel of stalling, did not join Thursday's talks. However mediators planned to consult with Hamas' Doha-based negotiating team after the meeting, the official briefed on the talks told Reuters.</p>

<p>Israel's delegation includes spy chief David Barnea, head of the domestic security service Ronen Bar, and the military's hostages chief Nitzan Alon, defence officials said on Wednesday.</p>

<p>CIA Director Bill Burns and U.S. Middle East envoy Brett McGurk represented Washington at the talks, convened by Qatari prime minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, with Egypt's intelligence chief Abbas Kamel also in Doha.</p>

<p>Israel and Hamas have each blamed the other for failure to reach a deal but in the run-up to Thursday's meeting, neither side appeared to rule out an agreement.</p>

<p>A source in the Israeli negotiating team said on Wednesday that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has allowed significant leeway on a few of the substantial disputes.</p>

<p>Gaps include the presence of Israeli troops in Gaza, the sequencing of a hostage release and restrictions on access to northern Gaza.</p>

<p>In the lead-up to Thursday's talks, Hamas, which rejects any U.S. or Israeli intervention in shaping the "day after" the war in Gaza, told mediators that if Israel made a "serious" proposal that is in line with Hamas' previous proposals the group would continue to engage in negotiations.</p>

<p>Senior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri told Reuters on Thursday that the group is committed to the negotiation process and urged mediators to secure Israel's commitment to a proposal Hamas agreed to in early July, which he said would end the war and required a full withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza.</p>

<p>Even as negotiators arrived in Qatar, fighting continued in Gaza, with Israeli troops hitting targets in the southern cities of Rafah and Khan Younis.</p>

<p>After months of a war which has laid waste to Gaza, killed more than 40,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza health officials, and driven almost all of its 2.3 million population from their homes, there was a desperate desire for an end to the fighting.</p>

<p>"Enough is enough, we want to get back to our homes in Gaza City, every hour a family is getting killed or a house getting bombed," said Aya, 30, sheltering with her family in Deir Al-Balah in the central part of the Gaza Strip, where hundreds of thousands have sought refuge from the fighting.</p>

<p>"We are hopeful this time. Either it's this time or never I am afraid," she told Reuters via a chat app.</p>

<p>In Tel Aviv, families of some of the hostages protested outside the headquarters of Netanyahu's Likud party.</p>

<p>"To the negotiating team - if a deal is not signed today or in the coming days at this summit, do not return to Israel. You have no reason to return to Israel without a deal," said Yotam Cohen, whose brother Nimrod Cohen is a hostage in Gaza.</p>

<p>The hostages were taken in the Hamas raid on southern Israel on Oct 7 in which the militants killed some 1,200 people, triggering the war in the Palestinian enclave.</p>

<p><strong>SEVERE RESPONSE</strong></p>

<p>In a statement Hamas issued late on Wednesday jointly with some smaller factions, it reaffirmed the outstanding demands the factions wanted a ceasefire agreement to achieve.</p>

<p>The group said negotiations "should examine mechanisms to implement what was agreed upon in the framework deal submitted by mediators that would achieve a comprehensive ceasefire, a complete withdrawal of Israeli forces, breaking the siege, opening crossings and reconstruction of Gaza as well as reaching a serious hostages/prisoners deal."</p>

<p>Iran's threat of a response to the killing of Haniyeh has added extra gravity to the talks. Three senior Iranian officials have said that only a ceasefire deal in Gaza would hold Iran back from direct retaliation against Israel.</p>

<p>But a possible escalation from the Iranian-backed Hezbollah movement in southern Lebanon is also weighing on the outlook.</p>

<p>Following a missile strike that killed 12 youngsters in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights on July 27, Israel assassinated Hezbollah's senior military commander Fuad Shukr in Beirut, prompting vows of retaliation from the movement.</p>

<p>Israel and Hezbollah have been exchanging regular fire for months but the exchanges have been kept within tacitly understood red lines that risk being erased if the conflict escalates.</p>

<p>Israel has neither confirmed or denied its involvement in Haniyeh's killing. The U.S. Navy has deployed warships and a submarine to the Middle East to bolster Israeli defences.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A team of UN experts will visit Bangladesh next week to investigate the killings of the protesters ahead of and in the aftermath of Sheikh Hasina's resignation as the prime minister last week, it was announced on Thursday.</p>

<p>This will be the first time the UN is sending a fact-finding mission to Bangladesh since its independence in 1971 to investigate widespread human rights abuses in the country, according to a UN official, said a post on X by the Chief Adviser of the Government of Bangladesh.</p>

<p>Muhammad Yunus took oath as the Chief Adviser of the interim government on August 8, days after Sheikh Hasina's government collapsed and she fled to India on August 5 amid violent protests over quota reforms for government jobs.</p>

<p>"The United Nations is sending a UN fact-finding team next week to probe atrocities committed during the Student Revolution in July and early this month. UN human rights chief Volker Turk announced the move when he called Chief Adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus late Wednesday," the Chief Adviser of Government of Bangladesh said in a post on X, the handle for which is run by Muhammad Yunus' office.</p>

<p>Bangladesh descended into chaos last week after Sheikh Hasina's departure while the Army stepped in to fill the power vacuum on August 5. Before that, the anti-government protests had killed more than 500 people since mid-July.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Volker Turk assured his support and said an inclusive, human rights-centred approach will ensure the transition succeeds.</p>

<p>Volker Turk in a post late on Wednesday night said, "Promising phone call with @ChiefAdviserGoB Muhammad Yunus. I assured him of @UNHumanRights Office's solidarity with the people of #Bangladesh &amp; our support to the interim govt at this pivotal time. An inclusive, human rights-centred approach will ensure this transition succeeds." Earlier on Wednesday, after his phone call with Turk, Yunus had posted: "The UN human rights chief, @volker_turk has made a phone call to Bangladesh Chief Adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus on Wednesday." "A team of UN experts would soon visit the country to investigate [the killings]," Volker Turk told Chief Adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus today during a phone conversation.</p>

<p>Muhammad Yunus said in a connecting post on X: The UN rights chief said a UN-led investigation will be launched very soon to probe the killing of the protesters during the Student Revolution.</p>

<p>Human rights will be the cornerstone of his administration and the protection of every citizen is the top most priority of the government, Muhammad Yunus, who has sought UN cooperation to uphold human rights, said.</p>

<p>"The Chief Adviser thanked him and his long-time friend Antonio Guterres, the UN Secretary-General, for supporting the Bangladesh students' revolution and championing their rights during unprecedented and devastating killings of student protestors," Muhammad Yunus said in the series of posts.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, a complaint was filed on Wednesday with the investigation agency of Bangladesh's International Crimes Tribunal against Sheikh Hasina and eight others, accusing them of committing genocide and crimes against humanity during the mass movement of the students against her government.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

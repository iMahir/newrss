       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former U.S. President Donald Trump's vice presidential pick J.D. Vance has openly praised the work of Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan, a sign that the agency's broad approach to antitrust enforcement could enjoy some level of support from a second Trump administration.</p>

<p>Vance, a Republican U.S. senator from Ohio, joined the presidential ticket on Monday at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, where Trump officially became the party's nominee.</p>

<p>Vance is one of several Republican lawmakers, including U.S. Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri and Florida U.S. Representative Matt Gaetz, called "Khanservatives" for their agreement with the FTC chair that U.S. antitrust law has a broader purpose than keeping prices down for consumers.</p>

<p>"She recognized there has to be a broader understanding of how we think about competition in the marketplace," Vance said at an event in Washington in February.</p>

<p>The comments reflect a tension in the conservative movement, between an impulse to shrink regulatory agencies and a willingness to use antitrust laws to challenge powerful corporations â€” especially in Big Tech, where some hope to tackle perceived censorship of conservatives online.</p>

<p>Joseph Coniglio, director of antitrust policy at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, said Vance is among the latter.</p>

<p>"I do think that picking Senator Vance as vice president certainly sends a signal in one direction," said Coniglio. His think tank receives funding from several major technology companies.</p>

<p>Scrutiny of Big Tech would not be a departure for Trump. The FTC and Department of Justice under Trump initiated investigations into Meta, Amazon, Apple and Google over alleged antitrust violations. All four companies were eventually sued, and have denied wrongdoing.</p>

<p>Vance is a Yale-educated lawyer and venture capitalist who worked at corporate law firm Sidley Austin and has helped Trump fundraise in Silicon Valley. He has also called for the breakup of one of its biggest companies.</p>

<p>"Long overdue, but it's time to break Google up," Vance tweeted in February, lamenting that "monopolistic control of information in our society resides with an explicitly progressive technology company."</p>

<p>It remains to be seen what a potential second Trump administration would focus on. The conservative Heritage Foundation's Project 2025 policy platform discusses ways conservative causes can be championed by antitrust enforcers, but also questions whether the FTC should continue to exist.</p>

<p>Business groups have criticized President Joe Biden's antitrust enforcers for going beyond traditional considerations of how competition affects prices to focus on issues including labor.</p>

<p>The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has sued to block the FTC's recent ban on employers requiring workers to sign agreements not to join rivals or launch competing businesses.</p>

<p>Vance said at the February event, hosted by Silicon Valley startup incubator Y Combinator, that his view of antitrust encompasses not only helping small firms compete, but also on workers and the quality of consumer goods.</p>

<p>He disagreed with what he described as some conservatives' view that corporations' behavior cannot be "tyrannical."</p>

<p>"I want people to live good lives in our country," he said. "I don't really care if the entity that is most threatening to that vision is a private entity or a public entity."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Usha Chilukuri Vance, the wife of JD Vance, whom Donald Trump declared as his running mate in the upcoming US presidential elections on Monday, brings a wealth of credentials and a deep connection to Indian values and culture.</p>

<p>A litigator at a national firm, Usha Vance is the daughter of Indian immigrants and has an impressive academic background.</p>

<p>She holds a bachelor's degree in History from Yale University and a Master of Philosophy degree from the University of Cambridge, according to the New York Times.</p>

<p>Born Usha Chilukuri, she has carved out a distinguished career in the legal field, having clerked for Supreme Court Justices John Roberts and Brett Kavanaugh before Kavanaugh's nomination to the Court.</p>

<p>Raised in a suburb of San Diego, California, with a strong emphasis on education and hard work, Usha's academic achievements include serving as Managing Editor of the Yale Journal of Law &amp; Technology and Executive Development Editor of The Yale Law Journal, according to a biography from Munger, Tolles &amp; Olson law firm.</p>

<p>After four years of intense extracurricular activity at Yale, she continued her studies as a Gates fellow at Cambridge, where she engaged with left-wing and liberal groups. She was a registered Democrat in 2014.</p>

<p>Usha and JD Vance first met at Yale Law School and were married in Kentucky in 2014, with a Hindu priest presiding over a separate ceremony, according to the New York Times. The couple has three children together.</p>

<p>Usha Vance has played a subtle yet significant role in her husband's success. She assisted Vance in organizing his thoughts on the social decline in rural white America, which inspired his best-selling memoir, Hillbilly Elegy, which was adapted into a film directed by Ron Howard in 2020.</p>

<p>In the past, she has made some rare appearances with Vance as he sought the Ohio Senate seat.</p>

<p>As the US presidential elections draw near, former US President Donald Trump made his pick for Vice President, selecting JD Vance as his running mate on Monday. Trump confirmed Vance's candidature through a post on social media.</p>

<p>Speaking to ANI, a US-based global real estate investment advisor and a well-known entrepreneur, AI Mason said, "Usha Vance is a highly accomplished attorney and daughter of Indian immigrants -- and her husband brings youth and diversity to the Trump ticket."</p>

<p>"She knows the Indian culture and all about India. She can be a big help to her husband in navigating great ties between USA and India," the entrepreneur, who is also a friend of the Trump family, said.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in an interview earlier with Fox &amp; Friends, Usha Chilukuri Vance and her Senator husband talked about the two having different faiths, and what are their views on the speculations of him becoming a pick for the Vice President of the US.</p>

<p>"I don't think people understand how hard he works and how creative he is. Everything he says and does is built on a foundation of so much thought. He's always trying to do better," Usha Vance said.</p>

<p>On being asked about the reason behind her support for JD Vance, as the US Presidential elections remain around the corner, Usha told Fox, "There are a few different reasons...One is that I grew up in a religious household. My parents are Hindu, and that was one of the things that made them such good parents, that makes them really very good people. And so I think I've seen that...the power of that in my own life, and I knew that JD was searching for something. This just felt right for him."</p>

<p>The interview was taken three weeks before the announcement of JD Vance as the running mate of Trump in the upcoming US presidential polls.</p>

<p>Vance was born James David Bowman in Middletown, Ohio, to a mother who struggled with addiction and a father who left the family when JD was a toddler. He was raised by his grandparents.</p>

<p>The Trump campaign says the former president, following his brush with death, will call for unity in the face of tragedy instead of criticising his political adversaries as he faces off with President Biden in a 2024 election rematch.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After dodging a bullet at a rally and seeing the US Supreme Court bolster his presidential immunity claims this month, Donald Trump was handed another gift Monday: the dismissal of his classified documents case.</p>

<p>As the only president ever to be twice impeached -- and twice acquitted -- and the country's only ex-president convicted of criminal charges, the septuagenarian has often struggled to stay afloat.</p>

<p>His blunders, multitude of scandals and vitriolic statements have shocked millions of Americans. Many heads of state see him as a danger to global stability and the fight against global warming, and he has stood accused of indulging far-right groups and disparaging immigrants.</p>

<p>But each time he is said to be sunk, he roars back to the surface, and this week he is heading into Milwaukee riding very high.</p>

<p>On Thursday the Republican National Convention will overlook Trump's vows of vengeance against his political enemies and swat aside his various legal woes to formally nominate him as the party's flagbearer going into the November election against President Joe Biden.</p>

<p>Trump, the brash billionaire who burst onto the political landscape a decade ago as a super disruptor and champion of conservatives, appears unstoppable.</p>

<p>"It sure seems he's on a roll," Texas alternate delegate Orlando Dona, wearing Trump pins and a straw-colored cowboy hat, told AFP.</p>

<p>The 64-year-old Dona, like many conservatives, believes the various cases against Trump have been politically motivated, "and he is coming out of all this justified."</p>

<p>As for the shooting, some are chalking it up to divine intervention.</p>

<p>"I personally think it was the hand of God," Wisconsin former governor Scott Walker told AFP at the convention.</p>

<p>Walker, who ran for president against Trump briefly in 2016, said Trump the man has earned a reputation for taking on anything.</p>

<p>"He's never going to stop being a fighter," he said. "And I think people here realize he's fighting for them, and these wins are not just about wins for him, they're wins for the American people."</p>

<p><strong>- 'A lot of obstacles' -</strong></p>

<p>Trump earned the nickname "Teflon Don" for weathering a multitude of storms.</p>

<p>The #MeToo movement precipitated the downfall of dozens of powerful Americans. Not Trump, despite multiple accusations of sexual abuse, a 2023 civil trial finding of liability for the sexual assault of writer E. Jean Carroll, and an alleged affair with pornographic actress Stormy Daniels.</p>

<p>After an explosive "Access Hollywood" tape emerged in 2016 in which Trump makes degrading remarks about women and boasted about groping their genitals, some Republican heavyweights withdrew their support, and he was predicted to lose the female vote.</p>

<p>That collapse didn't happen, and he won the White House a month later.</p>

<p>Now, it appears he will pull off another miracle, avoiding three of the four lawsuits he had been facing before the election.</p>

<p>"If the story of even the last 18 months teaches us anything, there were a lot of obstacles that were put up to president Trump, and the fact that he's gotten through them shows, I think, part of what gives me faith in this country," businessman and former 2024 Vivek Ramaswamy told reporters at the convention.</p>

<p>"As Martin Luther King said, the arc of history is long but it bends towards justice," Ramaswamy said. "I believe that's exactly what it is doing in recent months, days, and over the last year of president Trump's journey as well."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The soldier's life was not in danger, Darmanin said on X, while a police source told AFP that he had suffered a shoulder wound.</p>

<p>The attack at the Gare de l'Est station in northern Paris came less than two weeks before the start of the Olympic Games in the French capital.</p>

<p>"Thoughts to the soldier injured tonight at the Gare de l'Est," Armed Forces Minister Sebastien Lecornu wrote on X, paying tribute to the French troops protecting citizens.</p>

<p>He said the soldier was part of a special military operation to protect sensitive sites in Paris that was launched following the 2015 Islamist attacks on the satirical Charlie Hebdo newspaper.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The Republican Party on Monday formally confirmed Donald Trump as its nominee to take on President Joe Biden in November's election.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump won formal nomination Monday as the Republican presidential candidate and picked a right-wing loyalist for running mate, kicking off a triumphalist party convention in the wake of last weekend's failed assassination attempt.</p>

<p>Trump announced 39-year-old Ohio Senator J.D. Vance as his vice presidential pick, rewarding a one-time harsh critic who became one of his most reliable -- and uncompromising -- supporters in Congress.</p>

<p>Trump, 78, is guaranteed a hero's welcome at the convention in Milwaukee, where delegates delivered their formal nomination two days after the scandal-plagued former president survived an assassination attempt at a rally.</p>

<p>"As Vice President, J.D. will continue to fight for our Constitution, stand with our Troops, and will do everything he can to help me MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN," Trump posted on Truth Social.</p>

<p>While Trump is increasingly confident of a shock return to the White House -- despite multiple legal problems and two impeachments during his first term -- President Joe Biden is reeling from weak polls and Democratic concerns over his health.</p>

<p>In the delegates count in Milwaukee, Eric Trump put his father over the threshold on behalf of the Florida delegation, calling him "the greatest president that ever lived."</p>

<p>Vance had been widely expected as Trump's pick. He will bolster the ticket on the right wing, but with less chance of expanding appeal to more moderate voters and women.</p>

<p>The standard-bearer for a new kind of populism that has come to the fore under Trump, Vance is also one of the least experienced VP picks in modern history.</p>

<p>But he embraces the ex-president's isolationist, anti-immigration America First movement. Vance is further to the right than his new boss on many issues including abortion, where he embraces calls for federal legislation.</p>

<p>He initially made his name with the 2016 memoir "Hillbilly Elegy," a best-selling account of his Appalachian family and modest Rust Belt upbringing, which gave a voice to rural, working-class resentment in left-behind America.</p>

<p>Turning his back on previous opposition to Trump, whom he once said might be "America's Hitler," Vance reinvented himself and ultimately won the ex-president's key endorsement in the 2022 Ohio Senate race, launching his meteoric rise.</p>

<p><strong>- 'Supposed to be dead' -</strong></p>

<p>Trump's convention comes as the country is still reeling from a botched attempt by a gunman to kill Trump at a rally in Pennsylvania Saturday.</p>

<p>Some 50,000 Republicans descended on the shores of Lake Michigan for the four-day gathering, four months before election day.</p>

<p>The attempted assassination -- in which one bystander was killed, two more wounded and Trump received a light wound in his ear -- was expected to dominate proceedings.</p>

<p>The Secret Service, which is battling criticism it failed to protect Trump from the shooter, said it was "fully prepared" to ensure security at the convention.</p>

<p>Leading in multiple polls, despite being convicted at his hush-money criminal case in New York, Trump is exuding confidence.</p>

<p>At 81, Biden is facing calls from his own side to quit the race over concerns around his age.</p>

<p>His campaign released a statement saying the Trump-Vance agenda would "take away Americans' rights, hurt the middle class, and make life more expensive -- all while benefiting the ultra-rich and greedy corporations."</p>

<p>Trump scored another victory Monday as a judge dismissed the criminal case against him over accusations he endangered national security by holding on to top secret documents after leaving the White House.</p>

<p>- Message of unity -</p>

<p>He immediately took to Truth Social to call for the dismissal of all legal cases against him, insisting again that he was being targeted for political reasons.</p>

<p>Trump told the New York Post he had "prepared an extremely tough speech" about Biden's "horrible administration" to deliver at the convention.</p>

<p>As some Republicans -- including Vance -- sought to blame Democrats' anti-Trump rhetoric for the attack, Trump also said he hopes to "unite our country."</p>

<p>Still, that would see him have to rein in the instinct to settle scores -- demonstrated by his cry for supporters to "fight" in the seconds after Saturday's attack.</p>

<p>The Milwaukee gathering is largely designed in Trump's image, with digital banners beaming out a message in the cavernous convention arena: "Make America Great Once Again."</p>

<p>The branding reflects his takeover of the party.</p>

<p>A diminished figure after his 2020 election loss and a subsequent riot at the Capitol by his supporters, Trump has spent much of the last four years reshaping Republican politics.</p>

<p>Installing loyalists including his daughter-in-law Lara Trump atop the Republican National Committee, the billionaire has effectively crushed dissent.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The news, carried on Trump's Truth Social media website, emerged at the start of the four-day Republican National Convention in Milwaukee to nominate the party's presidential ticket.</p>

<p>The selection of James David Vance, author of the bestselling memoir "Hillbilly Elegy," could increase the odds of Trump supporters turning out for the Nov. 5 election as the Ohio native is deeply popular with the Republican candidate's base.</p>

<p>A staunch conservative from a Republican state, Vance is unlikely to bring many new voters into Trump's corner, however, and may even alienate some moderates. Some Trump supporters had pushed him to select a woman or person of color as his No. 2 to expand a coalition that skews toward white men.</p>

<p>The former president, 78, survived an assassination attempt at a Pennsylvania campaign rally on Saturday by a gunman whose motive remains unknown.</p>

<p>Several of Trump's highest-profile backers - including former senior adviser Steve Bannon and Trump's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr. - have praised Vance for pushing the Republican Party to embrace a more hands-off foreign policy approach and for supporting trade barriers.</p>

<p>Vance has also delighted Trump supporters with his confrontational social media presence, a relative rarity in the Senate, where many lawmakers still try to maintain a sense of decorum and civility.</p>

<p>At 39, Vance will represent a younger generation in an election that features Trump and President Joe Biden, 81, bringing a counterweight to the Democratic ticket that also includes Vice President Kamala Harris, 59.</p>

<p>In selecting Vance, Trump passed over other possible contenders such including U.S. Senators Marco Rubio and Tim Scott and North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum.</p>

<p>Vance's rapid ascent has been unusual for American politics. After a troubled and impoverished childhood in southern Ohio, he served in the Marine Corps, won a scholarship to Yale Law School and later worked as a venture capitalist in San Francisco.</p>

<p>He rose to prominence after 2016 when he wrote "Hillbilly Elegy," in which he explored the socioeconomic problems confronting his hometown and the cycle of poverty that had entrapped Americans in the Appalachian Mountains, where his mother and her family had their origins.</p>

<p>The book criticized what Vance saw as a self-destructive culture in rural America and sought to explain Trump's popularity among impoverished white Americans.</p>

<p>Vance himself was harshly critical of Trump before and after Trump's 2016 election win against Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, calling him an "idiot" and "America's Hitler," among other epithets.</p>

<p>But as Vance geared up to run for the U.S. Senate in Ohio in 2022, he transformed into one of the former president's most consistent defenders, supporting Trump even when some Senate colleagues declined to do so.</p>

<p>Vance has played down the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. He said he "doubted" Mike Pence's life was in danger, despite violent protesters getting within yards of the former vice president as Secret Service agents rushed him out of the Capitol building. Vance has also echoed Trump's criticisms of the way the Justice Department has prosecuted Jan. 6 rioters, accusing the department of disregarding due process protections.</p>

<p>In February, he declined to criticize Trump for encouraging Russian President Vladimir Putin to attack America's NATO allies if they failed to increase their defense spending.</p>

<p>While the Republican Party historically stood for free markets and embraced foreign intervention as an important national security tool, Trump's 2016 election opened up significant rifts within the party. Vance has been one of the most vocal opponents of continued aid to Ukraine in the Senate, a stance at odds with many Republican legislative leaders.</p>

<p>On the campaign trail, the former venture capitalist has also served as a bridge between Trump associates and wealthy Silicon Valley donors, many of whom have opened their wallets to Trump this election.</p>

<p>Still, Vance's selection has its detractors among Trump associates, notably those who had wanted Trump to select a diverse vice presidential candidate. Though Trump and Biden are virtually tied in most national polls, Trump trails the Democratic president by significant margins among women and Black Americans.</p>

<p>Some Trump associates privately questioned whether it would be wise to take Vance out of the Senate with Democrats and Republicans vying for control of the upper chamber. Democrats hold a one-seat advantage, though they are likely to lose ground in the November election.</p>

<p>Ohio, while safely Republican in presidential elections, does occasionally elect Democrats in other races. Vance won his 2022 election by six percentage points.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Jason Vechhio, who was 150 steps away from the stage, said that it was a very positive experience until the former president was shot and then a kind of "confusion and fear set in".]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The mood was upbeat and there "didn't seem to be anything wrong at all", Jason Vecchio, a man who attended the Trump campaign rally in Pensylvannia on Saturday, told NDTV. Mr Vechhio, who was 150 steps away from the stage, said that it was a very positive experience until the former president was shot at and then a kind of "confusion and fear set in".</p>

<p>"There didn't seem to be anything wrong at all. We had seen the secret service snipers up on top of the building ... Everybody was laughing, we were dancing before. There were a lot of good vibes going on. Everyone was talking, having nice conversations. There were families, children. There were old people. It was a very positive experience up until then. Nothing made us think that there is going to be any attack," said Mr Vechhio.</p>

<p>The 78-year-old former president was injured but survived an assassination attempt, a brazen attack that shocked a nation already deeply polarized ahead of the November election.</p>

<p>"Those bullets whizzed by him, hit the machine and the boom comes down because it hit a hydraulic line. We see secret service jump on top of him, to shield him and protect him. It wasn't like instantly that we knew what was going on. Definitely sounded like gunfire because I have been around firearms. We get down, heard the gunfire stop. At that point I ran over to the fence, I hopped over the fence and took cover under a police car just because I wasn't sure there was a secondary shooter or if a shooter was in the crowd. No one had any idea where the shooter was. So I just wanted to be in the safest place I could be in.</p>

<p>"And then we all watched Trump stand up and put his fist in the air and we all stood up and started chanting. It was quite an experience. It was quite a moving moment to see him stand up after we all just thought he died. And then I walked over to the fence and walked over to my buddies and together we opened the fence and started funneling everybody through the exit," said Mr Vechhio, recounting what he saw at the event.</p>

<p>Trump was speaking when multiple bangs rang out. He clutched his ear, with blood visible on his ear and cheek, then ducked to the floor as Secret Service agents swarmed onto the podium, surrounding him and rushing him to a nearby vehicle.</p>

<p>"We were definitely confused at first. I think the fear kind of set in a little afterwards. I tried to make sure my friends were safe. After a few hours had passed, it kind of sink in a little more today what the true severity of the whole event was. This will go down in history and will be taught in schools," said Mr Vechhio.</p>

<p>Iconic images of a bloodied Trump waving his fist after the shooting are already galvanizing Republican hopes that voters will further rally behind him for a landslide victory in November.</p>

<p>"Immediately I saw him stand up. I was already standing at that point trying to look for my friends. The crowd was all looking up towards him. I looked up. I see him put his fist up, it was a sight to remember. The man had just got shot. We all thought he was dead. And he stood up and was so like patriotic when he said fight and put his hand up in the air. It was surreal. He wasn't scared. He was like this is my fight, we are going to win. Here we are, I am alive. He was as proud an American as I have ever seen," Mr Vechhio said.</p>

<p>The Secret Service faces intense scrutiny over how a gunman aiming an assault rifle was allowed to take position on a roof some 500 feet (150 meters) from one of the most protected political figures on the planet.</p>

<p>"There's always more to it. There's always stuff. We are going to be finding stuff out in the next few weeks. We've already found out a lot in past 24 hours. But there's always more to the story that is not very obvious. The whole situation was kind of strange that a single person was able to put a ladder up on to a building that was so close. That building had a great vantage point of the whole thing. So why did the Secret Service not secure the building or didn't have a member of the security up on that building to make sure something like this did not happen.</p>

<p>"It is just crazy to me that those security measure were not taken. This is negligent on the part of whoever was making the decisions. And since then we have also heard that, I can't say whether it is true or not, we've heard that the gentleman who had taken the shot had sights on him about three minutes and he was being told not to take the shot... I am looking forward to figure out what the truth is in the next coming days and weeks," said Mr Vechhio casting doubts on the ex president's security detail.</p>

<p>Thomas Crooks, the 20-year-old gunman who opened fire at Trump, was shot dead on the spot by Secret Service snipers. He appears to have acted alone but there's more to the probe, said the FBI.</p>

<p>The spectator who died in the shooting that targeted Trump was identified as Corey Comperatore, a 50-year-old firefighter and father of two.</p>

<p>"It definitely makes me angry. That gentleman was there with his daughter and wife as I was with my friends to show support for a politician that we support and we were having fun. He was there with his loved one showing support for their politician and to lose his life that day I just want to send my most sincere condolences to his family. It's tragic. It's very sad. I wish he still had his life," said Mr Vechhio.</p>

<p>Biden has sought to strike a presidential tone over the shooting, coming out quickly with a message of unity.</p>

<p>"We have been pretty divided over these past few years. Think there is good potential for this current event to actually bring Americans together and make America strong as a country. And bring us the success and make us great again," said Me Vecchio.</p>

<p>Pressed to answer what it is about Trump that he likes, Mr vechhio said, "He always has been a character, he always will be. He's fun to watch. I am definitely looking forward to hear him talk."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>More than 100 students were injured across Bangladesh on Monday in clashes between those protesting to end a quota system for government jobs and others loyal to the ruling party, police and witnesses said.</p>

<p>The protests mark the first significant demonstrations that Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has faced since she won a fourth straight term in an election in January boycotted by the main opposition.</p>

<p>Thousands of anti-quota protesters and members of the student wing of Hasina's Awami League hurled rocks and fought each other with sticks and iron rods at universities across the country, including Dhaka, police and witnesses said.</p>

<p>Students were injured on several campuses, police officials said.</p>

<p>The protesters called for marches and rallies to continue across the country to press their demands.</p>

<p>"This is more than just a student movement. To suppress this movement, incitement from the highest levels of government has been made. So, common people have to come to the streets," said Nahid Islam, the coordinator of the anti-quota protests.</p>

<p>The protests began earlier this month after the High Court ordered the government to restore 30% job quotas for the descendants of freedom fighters. They have continued despite Bangladesh's top court suspending that order for a month last week.</p>

<p>The protests intensified on Sunday night after Hasina refused to meet the students' demands, stating that the issue was now before the court.</p>

<p>Hasina said those who oppose job quotas for relatives of freedom fighters are the 'Razakar', which collaborated with the Pakistani army during the 1971 War of Independence. Her comments led thousands of students to leave their dormitories on the Dhaka University campus at midnight to protest.</p>

<p>"An attempt is being made to transform the anti-quota movement into an anti-state one using the emotions of young students," said Foreign Minister Hasan Mahmud. "The government will not allow an unstable situation to develop."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The government on Monday hiked the windfall tax on domestically produced crude oil to Rs 7,000 per tonne, from Rs 6,000 per tonne.</p>

<p>The tax is levied in the form of Special Additional Excise Duty (SAED).</p>

<p>The SAED on the export of diesel, petrol and jet fuel or ATF, has been retained at 'nil'.</p>

<p>The new rates are effective from July 16, an official notification said.</p>

<p>India first imposed windfall profit taxes on July 1, 2022, joining a host of nations that tax supernormal profits of energy companies. The tax rates are reviewed every fortnight based on average oil prices in the previous two weeks.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Apple's shares rose 2.5% to a record high on Monday after Morgan Stanley raised its price target on the iPhone maker's shares and designated the stock as a "top pick," citing the company's AI efforts as a boost to device sales.</p>

<p>In what was seen as a move to catch up with Alphabet's Google and Microsoft-backed OpenAI, the iPad maker last month unveiled Apple Intelligence, luring customers to upgrade their devices to be able to use the new technology.</p>

<p>Apple's shares, which have jumped nearly 20% this year, rose to $236.30, giving the company a market value of $3.62 trillion, the highest in the world.</p>

<p>"Apple Intelligence is a clear catalyst to boost iPhone and iPad shipments," Morgan Stanley analysts said.</p>

<p>The new technology is compatible with only 8% of iPhone and iPad devices and Apple has 1.3 billion units of smartphones currently in use by customers, the analysts said, adding that the company could sell nearly 500 million iPhones over the next two years.</p>

<p>Morgan Stanley, which previously expected Apple to sell between 230 million and 235 million iPhones annually over the next two years, raised its price target on the company's shares to $273 from $216.</p>

<p>The stock has an average rating of "buy" with a median price target of $217, and has outperformed the S&amp;P 500 index this year, according to LSEG data.</p>

<p>Industry analysts expect Samsung and Apple to lead the charge in global smartphone market recovery this year given the buzz around GenAI-enabled smartphones.</p>

<p>Apple sold 45.2 million smartphones globally in the three months ending June, up from 44.5 million a year earlier, but its market share fell to 15.8% from 16.6% in the same period, according to IDC data.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Scientists have found evidence for an accessible cave conduit beneath the moon's surface. The location of the underground cave is not far from Apollo 11's landing site. It's 250 miles (400 kilometers) from where Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin landed 55 years ago.</p>

<p>Researchers analysed radar measurements by NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, and compared the results with lava tubes on Earth. Their findings appeared in the journal <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-024-02302-y.epdf?sharing_token=DmQt9tO2f0EhQ_htee77wdRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0NM3XCoO8qqQAVpZqycEJ41v-Y1i8jue3aIH5QvXVkwNKM1VU1zJ66l13rexlhrvWyR1SrF_fl-osl851IG6owAa0mBcJWiYLUEFsYJHaDQToCmPmK9-zmmu3ISDRCd_-bbjc6mWGjLESX0dlosaOO6ajSxqNLEsAwtOYQWjRSDZUas1FsiA_ba07AU0JoJn7TrUFfzNVCqnuk84kIxwY2jwOTbMazxswZY2EG7dQTfD1SvRhx_8EIghgsSVe7Iq-gYPofeRd77R9YDcYTXaGQVnz2CpWIxs9d3_oHWLfgaj9TrjR1kBhEgeYbu-Ocy8JU%3D&amp;tracking_referrer=www.theguardian.com">Nature Astronomy</a>.</p>

<p>The finding suggests that the cave is a "promising site for a lunar base" as it offers shelter from the harsh surface environment and could support long-term human exploration of the Moon.</p>

<p>The cave is accessible from the deepest known pit on the moon. It's located at the Mare Tranquillitatis (Sea of Tranquility)</p>

<p>The pit, like the more than 200 others discovered up there, was created by the collapse of a lava tube.</p>

<p>NASA is aiming to build a semi-permanent crewed base on the moon, China and Russia have also announced interest in creating lunar research outposts. But, a permanent lunar base can only be set up in environments protected from cosmic radiation and with stable temperatures.</p>

<p>Such caves could form an emergency lunar shelter because the astronauts would be naturally shielded from harmful cosmic rays, solar radiation and micrometeorites.</p>

<p>Lunar orbiters first spotted pits on the moon more than a decade ago. Many are thought to be "skylights" that connect to underground caves such as lava tubes, giant underground tunnels that form through volcanic processes, reported <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/article/2024/jul/15/underground-cave-found-on-moon-could-be-ideal-base-for-explorers">The Guardian</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kenyan police said they arrested on Monday a suspected serial killer who confessed to murdering 42 women, including his wife, and discarding their dismembered bodies in a Nairobi rubbish dump.</p>

<p>Since Friday, nine butchered bodies trussed up in plastic bags have been hauled from the site of an abandoned quarry in the Mukuru slum, a gruesome discovery that has horrified the nation.</p>

<p>Acting Inspector General of Police Douglas Kanja said the 33-year-old suspect, named as Collins Jumaisi Khalusha, was arrested at around 3:00 am (0000 GMT) near a Nairobi bar where he had been watching the Euro 2024 football final.</p>

<p>"We are dealing with a serial killer, a psychopathic serial killer who has no respect for human life," the head of the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) Mohamed Amin told reporters. "We are dealing with a vampire, a psychopath."</p>

<p>Amin said Khalusha claimed the murders took place between 2022 and July 11 this year.</p>

<p>"The suspect confessed to have lured, killed and disposed of 42 female bodies at the dumping site," he added.</p>

<p>"Unfortunately, and this is very sad, the suspect alleged that his first victim was his wife... who he strangled to death, before dismembering her body and disposing it at the same site."</p>

<p>Police said Khalusha would appear in court Tuesday.</p>

<p><strong>'Luring another victim'</strong></p>

<p>The suspect was tracked down after analysis of one of the victim's mobile phones, Amin said, in a joint operation by the DCI and the National Police Service.</p>

<p>As officers swooped, "he was in the process of luring another victim", Amin said.</p>

<p>Khalusha had confessed to having had "carnal knowledge" with some of his victims, he added.</p>

<p>Officers searched his one-room house, located just 100 metres (300 feet) from where the bodies were found, discovering a machete, nylon sacks, rope, a pair of industrial rubber gloves -- as well as a "pink female handbag", and "two female panties".</p>

<p>The areas will remain "active crime scenes", Amin said, promising a thorough investigation.</p>

<p>Nine mutilated and dismembered bodies have so far been retrieved from the crime scene, according to police, with Kanja saying autopsies on the victims would be carried out on Monday. Eight have been confirmed to be female.</p>

<p>A second suspect who was caught with a phone belonging to one of the victims has also been arrested, Amin said.</p>

<p>After the discovery of the bodies, Kenya's State Department For Gender and Affirmative Action on Sunday condemned the "horrific act" and urged more action against gender-based violence.</p>

<p>In 2022 the East African country recorded 725 femicide cases according to a UN report, the highest number since data collection began in 2015.</p>

<p><strong>Police under spotlight</strong></p>

<p>The dumped bodies have thrown yet another spotlight on Kenyan police and added more pressure on President William Ruto, who is struggling to contain a crisis over widespread anti-government protests that saw dozens of demonstrators killed.</p>

<p>Kenya's police watchdog, the Independent Police Oversight Authority (IPOA), said Friday it was looking into whether there was any police involvement in the bodies found in the dump, noting the dumpsite was just 100 metres from a police station.</p>

<p>IPOA was also investigating if there had been a "failure to act to prevent" the grisly killings.</p>

<p>Kanja told reporters on Sunday that all officers at the nearby police post had been transferred.</p>

<p>Still, tensions ran high at the crime scene over the weekend, as volunteers combed through the vast piles of rubbish in search of more victims with officers briefly firing tear gas to disperse the crowds.</p>

<p>Kenyan police are often accused by rights groups of using excessive force and carrying out unlawful killings or running hit squads, but few have faced justice.</p>

<p>The Mukuru killings follow the so-called "Shakahola forest massacre" when the bodies of some 400 members of a doomsday cult were discovered in mass graves near the coast last year.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At least 35 people were killed and 230 injured on Monday after heavy rain in eastern Afghanistan, a local official said.</p>

<p>"On Monday evening, rain caused by thunderstorms killed 35 people and injured 230 others in Jalalabad and certain districts of Nangarhar" province, Quraishi Badloon, head of the department of information and culture, told AFP.</p>

<p>The casualties were caused by heavy storms and rains that collapsed trees, walls and roofs of people's houses, Badloon said.</p>

<p>"There is a possibility that casualties might rise," he went on, adding that the wounded as well as victims' corpses were brought to Nangarhar regional hospital and Fatima-tul-Zahra hospital.</p>

<p>The tragedy comes after flash floods killed hundreds of people in Afghanistan in May and swamped agricultural lands in the country, where 80 percent of the population depends on farming to survive.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A new "high efficacy" malaria vaccine co-developed by the Serum Institute of India (SII) and the University of Oxford was officially rolled out on Monday when Cote d'Ivoire in West Africa became the first country to begin administering R21/Matrix-M.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A new "high efficacy" malaria vaccine co-developed by the Serum Institute of India (SII) and the University of Oxford was officially rolled out on Monday when Cote d'Ivoire in West Africa became the first country to begin administering R21/Matrix-M.</p>

<p>The vaccine, which was granted World Health Organisation (WHO) approval last year, is said to have undergone a rigorous regulatory process and clinical assessment and was found to be highly effective and affordable. As a low-dose vaccine, it can be manufactured at speed and scale which is seen as critical to stemming the spread of the mosquito-borne disease.</p>

<p>"Reducing the malaria burden is finally within sight. Today's start of the R21/Matrix-M vaccine roll-out marks a monumental milestone after years of incredible work with our partners at Oxford and Novavax," said SII CEO Adar Poonawalla.</p>

<p>"At Serum, we believe that it is every person's right to have access to affordable and essential disease prevention. That's why we have committed to producing 100 million doses of R21, which will protect millions of lives and alleviate the burden of this deadly disease for future generations," he said.</p>

<p>In anticipation of the roll-out, SII said it has manufactured 25 million doses of the vaccine and is committed to scaling up to 100 million doses annually. In keeping with its aim of delivering vaccines at scale and low cost, the Pune-headquartered company said it is offering the vaccine at less than USD 4 per dose.</p>

<p>"The roll-out of the R21/Matrix-M malaria vaccine marks the start of a new era in malaria control interventions with the high efficacy vaccine now accessible at a modest price and very large scale to many countries in greatest need. We hope that this vaccine very soon can be provided to all African countries who wish to use it," said Professor Adrian Hill, Director of the Jenner Institute at Oxford University.</p>

<p>R21/Matrix-M was co-developed by the university and SII leveraging Novavax's Matrix-M adjuvant technology. In December 2023, WHO granted it prequalification status after trials demonstrated that the vaccine was well tolerated, with a good safety profile, with injection site pain and fever as the most frequent adverse events.</p>

<p>Although the number of malaria-related deaths has fallen from 3,222 in 2017 to 1,316 in 2020 in Cote d'Ivoire, the deadly disease still kills four people a day, mostly small children, and "remains the leading cause of medical consultations", according to the country's Ministry of Health.</p>

<p>A total of 656,600 doses have been received, which will initially vaccinate 250,000 children aged between 0 and 23 months across 16 regions of Cote d'Ivoire. The R21/Matrix-M vaccine has also been authorised by Ghana, Nigeria, Burkina Faso and the Central African Republic.</p>

<p>R21 is the second malaria vaccine available in Sub-Saharan Africa following RTS,S and wide implementation of the malaria vaccines, in conjunction with existing prevention methods like bed nets, is expected to save tens of thousands of young lives each year. In total, 15 African countries are expected to introduce malaria vaccines with Gavi support in 2024, and countries plan to reach around 6.6 million children with the malaria vaccine in 2024 and 2025.</p>

<p>Dr Sania Nishtar, Chief Executive Officer of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, said: "Africa has borne the brunt of malaria for far too long, and Cote d'Ivoire has suffered more than most. With two safe and effective vaccines now available alongside other interventions, we can finally turn the tide against this killer disease." John Jacobs, President and Chief Executive Officer, Novavax, added: "The introduction of the R21/Matrix-M malaria vaccine in Cote d'Ivoire marks a breakthrough in the fight to protect vulnerable children against a leading cause of death across the region while reinforcing our mission to create innovative vaccines that improve public health."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Under growing pressure for a massive security failure, the US Secret Service on Monday vowed to cooperate with an independent review after a shooter was allowed to open fire on Donald Trump.</p>

<p>The 78-year-old former president was injured but survived an assassination attempt at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania Saturday, a brazen attack that shocked a nation already deeply polarized ahead of the November vote.</p>

<p>"The Secret Service is working with all involved Federal, state and local agencies to understand what happened, how it happened, and how we can prevent an incident like this from ever taking place again," the agency's director Kimberly Cheatle said in a statement.</p>

<p>"We understand the importance of the independent review announced by President Biden yesterday and will participate fully. We will also work with the appropriate Congressional committees on any oversight action," Cheatle added.</p>

<p>Trump was speaking at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania when multiple bangs rang out. He clutched his ear, with blood visible on his ear and cheek, then ducked to the floor as Secret Service agents swarmed onto the podium, surrounding him and rushing him to a nearby vehicle.</p>

<p>The shooter and a bystander were killed, and two spectators injured.</p>

<p>Biden ordered a full review of security at the rally, as well as at this week's Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where Trump will be crowned the party's presidential nominee.</p>

<p>The Secret Service has been under growing pressure over how a gunman aiming an assault rifle was allowed to take position on a roof some 500 feet (150 meters) from one of the most protected political figures on the planet.</p>

<p>And the questions grew louder when phone footage emerged of people sighting the gunman on the roof and trying to warn security before he opened fire.</p>

<p>With Trump set to appear at the convention Monday, Cheatle said the agency was working to toughen security at the event.</p>

<p>The Secret Service "designs operational security plans for National Special Security Events (NSSE) to be dynamic in order to respond to a kinetic security environment and the most up-to-date intelligence from our partners," her statement said.</p>

<p>On Sunday the Secret Service said it was "fully prepared" for the convention.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Romania's parliament on Monday approved the culling of almost 500 bears this year in a bid to control the protected species' "overpopulation" after a deadly hiker attack sparked nationwide outcry.</p>

<p>Romania is home to Europe's largest brown bear population outside of Russia with 8,000, according to the environment ministry.</p>

<p>Bears have killed 26 people and severely injured 274 others over the last 20 years in the southeastern European country, the ministry said earlier this year.</p>

<p>After a young hiker was mauled to death on a popular trail in Romania's Carpathian Mountains, Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu summoned lawmakers back from their summer recess to attend an emergency session of parliament.</p>

<p>As well as adopting legislation to control the brown bear population, the parliament held a moment of silence in the 19-year-old hiker's memory.</p>

<p>The law adopted Monday authorises the culling of 481 bears in 2024, more than twice last year's total of 220.</p>

<p>Lawmakers argued that the bears' "overpopulation" had led to an increase in attacks, while admitting that the law will not prevent attacks in the future.</p>

<p>But environmental groups have denounced the measure.</p>

<p>"The law solves absolutely nothing," World Wildlife Fund biologist Calin Ardelean told AFP, arguing that the focus should be shifted towards "prevention and intervention" as well as so-called "problem bears".</p>

<p>According to WWF Romania, culls will not remedy the problem unless measures are put in place to keep bears away from communities, such as better waste management or preventing people from feeding animals.</p>

<p>In 2023, about 7,500 emergency calls to signal bear sightings were recorded, more than double the previous year, according to data presented last week by Romanian authorities.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Florida judge appointed by Donald Trump has dismissed the criminal case against the former president on charges of mishandling top secret documents, saying the way that Special Counsel Jack Smith was appointed was improper.</p>

<p>The decision is a huge victory for Trump, who had been accused of endangering national security by holding onto top secret documents after leaving the White House.</p>

<p>Judge Aileen Cannon made her ruling after lawyers for the 78-year-old argued for a partial stay of proceedings to allow for an assessment of a Supreme Court ruling that a former president has broad immunity from prosecution.</p>

<p>"Former President Trump's Motion to Dismiss Indictment Based on the Unlawful Appointment and Funding of Special Counsel Jack Smith is GRANTED," Aileen wrote in her order.</p>

<p>"The Superseding Indictment is DISMISSED because Special Counsel Smith's appointment violates the Appointments Clause of the United States Constitution."</p>

<p>It comes as Trump is set to be anointed as his party's champion at the Republican National Convention, days after surviving an assassination attempt at a rally in Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>In the Florida case, Trump was facing 31 counts of "willful retention of national defense information," each punishable by up to 10 years in prison.</p>

<p>He also faced charges of conspiracy to obstruct justice and making false statements.</p>

<p>Trump allegedly kept classified documents -- which included records from the Pentagon and CIA -- unsecured at his Mar-a-Lago home and thwarted efforts to retrieve them.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Monday that Russia should be represented at a second summit aiming to secure lasting peace with the Kremlin, after more than two years of war.</p>

<p>Dozens of world leaders voiced support for a just peace in Ukraine after a high-level summit convened by Zelensky last month in Switzerland, to which Russia was not invited.</p>

<p>"I believe that Russian representatives should be at the second summit," Zelensky told a press conference in Kyiv, where he laid out preparatory work for a follow-up summit.</p>

<p>Zelensky announced separate meetings on key issues, including energy security, to be held in Qatar and on food security in Turkey ahead of a second summit.</p>

<p>Leaders and top officials from more than 90 states gathered at a Swiss mountainside resort on June 15 for the two-day summit dedicated to resolving the largest European conflict since World War II.</p>

<p>The Kremlin said that any discussions around ending the conflict that did not include Russia were "absurd."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

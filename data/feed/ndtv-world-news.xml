       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sam Altman has acknowledged that he heavily relied on advice from his friend, Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky, to grow OpenAI after ChatGPT became a global sensation. In a joint interview with Mr Chesky at the Aspen Ideas Festival, the OpenAI CEO mentioned that while many people offered help once ChatGPT gained popularity in late 2022, Mr Chesky was the only one who truly pitched in, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/28/sam-altman-airbnb-ceo-gave-me-hours-of-advice-on-growing-openai.html"><em>CNBC Make It </em></a>reported.</p>

<p>"Everything just went crazy for me," Mr Altman said. "Brian would sit down with me for about three hours every other week and provide a list of things I needed to do. He'd point out where I was behind, what I was messing up, and what I needed to proactively consider."</p>

<p>Five days after ChatGPT launched to the public, it surpassed 1 million users. By January 2023, the platform had 100 million monthly active users, making it the fastest-growing consumer application in history, according to CNBC Make It. As the Microsoft-backed artificial intelligence company experienced rapid growth, Chesky became a close confidant, Altman noted. Mr Chesky was "almost always right," Altman added, saying, "I learned to just always shut up and follow the advice."</p>

<p>Elaborating on the impact of Mr Chesky's advice on OpenAI's business, Altman mentioned that his friend guided him on hiring decisions and how to "map" out the company's strategy.</p>

<p>Recently, Mr Chesky pointed out that Mr Altman was "probably not thinking enough about" the political consequences of the company's generative AI technology, the OpenAI CEO said.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>King Charles and Queen Camilla were quickly taken away from an event in Jersey on Monday due to a security scare.</p>

<p>Queen Camilla was eating ice cream when a member of the royal staff whispered something to her. At the same time, King Charles was approached by his protection officer and informed that they needed to leave immediately.</p>

<p>Both Charles and Camilla were then escorted to the nearby Pomme d'Or hotel for safety.</p>

<p>Matt Taylor, founder of Jersey Sea Salt, told the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/royals/breaking-king-charles-queen-camilla-33249399"><em>Daily Mirror </em></a>he was talking to the King before being approached by his security detail.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/former-boxers-single-punch-results-in-mans-permanent-brain-injury-6115035#pfrom=home-ndtv_lateststories"><strong>Also Read | Former Boxer's Single Punch Results In UK Man's Permanent Brain Injury</strong></a><br />
<br />
He said, "He stopped at the stall and said, 'Ooh, sea salt.' And I said, 'Come and have a chat, sir'. Then his security appeared and grabbed me and said, 'He has to go, now.'</p>

<p>"He didn't seem panicked, but he was quite stern. They just ushered him out. It's a shame, as he'd stopped to chat with us of his own accord."</p>

<p>A concern raised by a member of the visit team led to this security alert, which was later determined to be a false alarm after a full background check. The event resumed shortly afterward.</p>

<p>This false alarm occurred just days after an assassination attempt on former US President Donald Trump at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. Trump was hit in the ear by a bullet and then swiftly taken to the ground by Secret Service agents, who returned fire and killed the gunman, Thomas Matthew Crooks.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump received a hero's welcome Monday at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, as he made his first public appearance since being wounded in an assassination attempt.</p>

<p>Wearing a white bandage on his ear, the former US president waved at a packed arena and received a standing ovation from cheering supporters, two days after the botched attack at a Pennsylvania rally.</p>

<p>Trump, 78, made no remarks to the convention, which erupted in loud applause and chants of "USA! USA!" Instead, he stood alongside his newly announced running mate, Senator J.D. Vance, and soaked in the warm reception.</p>

<p>After surveying the convention floor filled with more than 2,400 delegates, Trump took a seat next to Vance in a VIP box that also included House Republican Byron Donalds and Speaker of the House Mike Johnson.</p>

<p>Trump, wearing a blue suit and a trademark red tie, smiled and applauded as officials, guests and others took the stage to address the convention -- and to thank their party leader or praise his survival from a would-be assassin's attack.</p>

<p>Given Saturday's horrific events, "he has proven to be one tough S.O.B.," Sean O'Brien, president of the major International Brotherhood of Teamsters union, told the convention, drawing a huge roar from the crowd.</p>

<p>Trump is due on Thursday to formally accept his party's nomination as flagbearer to challenge President Joe Biden in the November 5 election.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yemen's Houthi rebels on Monday said they targeted two tankers in the Red Sea with missiles and drones after a British security agency reported several attacks in the troubled waterway.</p>

<p>In a statement on social media platform X, Houthi military spokesperson Yahya Saree identified the two ships as BENTLEY I, a Panama-flagged oil tanker, and the CHIOS LION, a Liberia-flagged crude oil tanker.</p>

<p>The BENTLEY I was attacked with "drone boats, unmanned aerial vehicles, and ballistic missiles", while the CHIOS LION was targeted with uncrewed surface vessels, Saree said.</p>

<p>They were targeted because their owners had used Israeli ports, according to the rebel spokesperson.</p>

<p>Earlier on Monday, the United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations reported two separate incidents in the Red Sea.</p>

<p>A ship sailing southwest of the port city of Hodeidah came under attack from three small vessels, two of which had three people each on board, UKMTO said.</p>

<p>The third skiff was unmanned, according to the agency, which is run by Britain's Royal Navy.</p>

<p>The "unmanned small craft collided with the vessel twice and the two manned small craft fired at the vessel", UKMTO said.</p>

<p>"After 15 minutes, the small craft aborted the attack. The vessel and crew are reported safe and the vessel is proceeding to its next port of call."</p>

<p>The same ship later reported four missiles exploding in "close proximity", UKMTO said, adding that the strikes did not cause any injuries or damage.</p>

<p>British maritime security firm Ambrey also reported the attack, saying the merchant vessel had a private armed security team on board.</p>

<p>In a separate incident on Monday, an uncrewed surface vessel "impacted" a merchant vessel 97 nautical miles northwest of Hodeidah, UKMTO said.</p>

<p>The attack caused "some damage and light smoke", it said, adding that "the vessel and crew are reported safe and proceeding to next port of call".</p>

<p>Houthi drone and missile strikes have taken place despite the deployment of Western naval forces to protect ships in the Red Sea, a vital waterway for global trade.</p>

<p>Since January, the United States and Britain have carried out repeated retaliatory strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen.</p>

<p>On Sunday, the US military's Central Command (CENTCOM) said its forces destroyed several Houthi drones.</p>

<p>"These actions were taken to protect freedom of navigation and make international waters safer and more secure," it said in a post on social media platform X.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Chris Harris, a father of three from Merthyr Tydfil, sustained a permanent brain injury from a single punch by former professional boxer Daniel Gerrard outside a pub in 2022.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chris Harris, a 40-year-old Merthyr Tydfil resident and father of three, had a permanent brain injury from a single punch outside of a pub. He now faces a lengthy recovery process. The incident happened outside the Vulcan Inn in the wee hours of May 2, 2022.</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://metro.co.uk/2024/07/15/man-left-permanent-brain-injury-single-punch-ex-boxer-21232132/">reports</a>, Harris was struck by former professional boxer Daniel Gerrard. This is not Gerrard's first offence; he has a prior conviction for manslaughter in 2012, resulting from a fatal punch during another pub brawl. The force of Gerrard's blow rendered Harris unconscious.</p>

<p>Harris sustained a serious head injury, including a two-inch skull fracture and bleeding on the brain. He woke up a day later at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff. The full extent of his recovery and the lasting effects of the brain injury remain unclear.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Describing the aftermath of the attack, Chris told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/i-punched-outside-nightclub-changed-29531140"><em>WalesOnline: </em></a>“I was woken up by my wife Lynsey, and she told me I had a massive brain injury and what happened. They'd operated fast and drilled my skull to release the pressure. I just broke down in tears. I thought my life was done. I had an hour to live basically before they operated."</p>

<p>“Lynsey told me that when she went home while I was being operated on, she didn't know if I would survive. I woke up after the operation in so much pain that I was crying throughout. I remained on the critical care ward for three days. Only three days later was I able to look at the scar on my head. It had 23 staples for that injury, and I was shocked by it. I stopped eating and lost a stone and a half in weight. When you go through something like that, you just think, ‘Wow. I've got three kids.' I just didn't know how we'd cope.”</p>

<p>Detective Constable <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.south-wales.police.uk/news/south-wales/news/2023/med-sep/merthyr-man-jailed-for-unprovoked-assault/">Michael Snare commented</a>, "Our thorough &nbsp;investigation showed at no time did Gerrard act in self-defence. All four men he violently assaulted did not pose any threat to him at the time he attacked them. Gerrard caused significant harm to these innocent bystanders."</p>

<p>The third victim suffered significant injuries having to undergo lifesaving surgery for a bleed to the brain. The other victims had a lump to the side of his head, and the first victim sustained stiches to his eyes, a broken nose and bruising and swelling to his face."</p>

<p>Gerrard from the Gurnos was sentenced to a total of four years imprisonment, with an extended licence of one year. While Jason Cox received a 12-month suspended sentence.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden on Monday said he was wrong to call for Donald Trump to be put in the "bullseye" in the race for the White House.</p>

<p>"It was a mistake to use the word," Biden told NBC when asked if he had gone too far with his rhetoric against the newly confirmed Republican nominee, who survived an attempted assassination Saturday at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>"I meant focus on him, focus on what he's doing. Focus on his policies, focus on the number of lies he told in the debate," said Biden.</p>

<p>The assassination attempt, in which Trump was grazed in one ear, shocked a nation already deeply polarized ahead of the November election.</p>

<p>Several prominent Republicans have since accused Biden of having responsibility for the assassination attempt because of his language against Trump.</p>

<p>"The central premise of the Biden campaign is that President Donald Trump is an authoritarian fascist who must be stopped at all costs," said J.D. Vance, who was announced on Monday as Trump's running mate for the 2024 ticket.</p>

<p>"That rhetoric led directly to President Trump's attempted assassination," wrote Vance on social media.</p>

<p>Biden had made the initial comments in a call to Democratic donors early last week.</p>

<p>"It's time to put Trump in the bullseye," the president said, in a call that was intended to galvanize supporters amid growing dissent over Biden's continued candidacy.</p>

<p>Those divisions emerged from Biden's disastrous debate performance last month, in which the president slurred his words, spoke incoherently at times and stood with mouth agape while Trump talked.</p>

<p>Biden's interview with NBC on Monday was the latest post-debate attempt by the White House to assuage growing fears over the 81-year-old president's age and mental state.</p>

<p>Speaking without the aid of a teleprompter, Biden told NBC's Lester Holt that his mental sharpness was "pretty damn good."</p>

<p>"I'm old," Biden told the US broadcaster, according to a transcript.</p>

<p>"But I'm only three years older than Trump, number one. And number two, my mental acuity has been pretty damn good."</p>

<p>He added: "I understand why people say, 'God, he's 81 years old. Whoa. What's he gonna be when he's 83 years old, 84 years?' It's a legitimate question to ask."</p>

<p>While accepting his language against Trump had been a "mistake," Biden said it was right to maintain focus on the threat posed by another Trump presidency.</p>

<p>"Look, I'm not the guy that said 'I want to be a dictator on day one,'" he said, referring to remarks by Trump that alarmed many people</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Trump's vice presidential pick J.D. Vance has openly praised the work of Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan, a sign that the agency's broad approach to antitrust enforcement could enjoy some level of support from a second Trump administration.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former U.S. President Donald Trump's vice presidential pick J.D. Vance has openly praised the work of Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan, a sign that the agency's broad approach to antitrust enforcement could enjoy some level of support from a second Trump administration.</p>

<p>Vance, a Republican U.S. senator from Ohio, joined the presidential ticket on Monday at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, where Trump officially became the party's nominee.</p>

<p>Vance is one of several Republican lawmakers, including U.S. Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri and Florida U.S. Representative Matt Gaetz, called "Khanservatives" for their agreement with the FTC chair that U.S. antitrust law has a broader purpose than keeping prices down for consumers.</p>

<p>"She recognized there has to be a broader understanding of how we think about competition in the marketplace," Vance said at an event in Washington in February.</p>

<p>The comments reflect a tension in the conservative movement, between an impulse to shrink regulatory agencies and a willingness to use antitrust laws to challenge powerful corporations — especially in Big Tech, where some hope to tackle perceived censorship of conservatives online.</p>

<p>Joseph Coniglio, director of antitrust policy at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, said Vance is among the latter.</p>

<p>"I do think that picking Senator Vance as vice president certainly sends a signal in one direction," said Coniglio. His think tank receives funding from several major technology companies.</p>

<p>Scrutiny of Big Tech would not be a departure for Trump. The FTC and Department of Justice under Trump initiated investigations into Meta, Amazon, Apple and Google over alleged antitrust violations. All four companies were eventually sued, and have denied wrongdoing.</p>

<p>Vance is a Yale-educated lawyer and venture capitalist who worked at corporate law firm Sidley Austin and has helped Trump fundraise in Silicon Valley. He has also called for the breakup of one of its biggest companies.</p>

<p>"Long overdue, but it's time to break Google up," Vance tweeted in February, lamenting that "monopolistic control of information in our society resides with an explicitly progressive technology company."</p>

<p>It remains to be seen what a potential second Trump administration would focus on. The conservative Heritage Foundation's Project 2025 policy platform discusses ways conservative causes can be championed by antitrust enforcers, but also questions whether the FTC should continue to exist.</p>

<p>Business groups have criticized President Joe Biden's antitrust enforcers for going beyond traditional considerations of how competition affects prices to focus on issues including labor.</p>

<p>The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has sued to block the FTC's recent ban on employers requiring workers to sign agreements not to join rivals or launch competing businesses.</p>

<p>Vance said at the February event, hosted by Silicon Valley startup incubator Y Combinator, that his view of antitrust encompasses not only helping small firms compete, but also on workers and the quality of consumer goods.</p>

<p>He disagreed with what he described as some conservatives' view that corporations' behavior cannot be "tyrannical."</p>

<p>"I want people to live good lives in our country," he said. "I don't really care if the entity that is most threatening to that vision is a private entity or a public entity."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Usha Chilukuri Vance, the wife of JD Vance, whom Donald Trump declared as his running mate in the upcoming US presidential elections on Monday, brings a wealth of credentials and a deep connection to Indian values and culture.</p>

<p>A litigator at a national firm, Usha Vance is the daughter of Indian immigrants and has an impressive academic background.</p>

<p>She holds a bachelor's degree in History from Yale University and a Master of Philosophy degree from the University of Cambridge, according to the New York Times.</p>

<p>Born Usha Chilukuri, she has carved out a distinguished career in the legal field, having clerked for Supreme Court Justices John Roberts and Brett Kavanaugh before Kavanaugh's nomination to the Court.</p>

<p>Raised in a suburb of San Diego, California, with a strong emphasis on education and hard work, Usha's academic achievements include serving as Managing Editor of the Yale Journal of Law &amp; Technology and Executive Development Editor of The Yale Law Journal, according to a biography from Munger, Tolles &amp; Olson law firm.</p>

<p>After four years of intense extracurricular activity at Yale, she continued her studies as a Gates fellow at Cambridge, where she engaged with left-wing and liberal groups. She was a registered Democrat in 2014.</p>

<p>Usha and JD Vance first met at Yale Law School and were married in Kentucky in 2014, with a Hindu priest presiding over a separate ceremony, according to the New York Times. The couple has three children together.</p>

<p>Usha Vance has played a subtle yet significant role in her husband's success. She assisted Vance in organizing his thoughts on the social decline in rural white America, which inspired his best-selling memoir, Hillbilly Elegy, which was adapted into a film directed by Ron Howard in 2020.</p>

<p>In the past, she has made some rare appearances with Vance as he sought the Ohio Senate seat.</p>

<p>As the US presidential elections draw near, former US President Donald Trump made his pick for Vice President, selecting JD Vance as his running mate on Monday. Trump confirmed Vance's candidature through a post on social media.</p>

<p>Speaking to ANI, a US-based global real estate investment advisor and a well-known entrepreneur, AI Mason said, "Usha Vance is a highly accomplished attorney and daughter of Indian immigrants -- and her husband brings youth and diversity to the Trump ticket."</p>

<p>"She knows the Indian culture and all about India. She can be a big help to her husband in navigating great ties between USA and India," the entrepreneur, who is also a friend of the Trump family, said.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in an interview earlier with Fox &amp; Friends, Usha Chilukuri Vance and her Senator husband talked about the two having different faiths, and what are their views on the speculations of him becoming a pick for the Vice President of the US.</p>

<p>"I don't think people understand how hard he works and how creative he is. Everything he says and does is built on a foundation of so much thought. He's always trying to do better," Usha Vance said.</p>

<p>On being asked about the reason behind her support for JD Vance, as the US Presidential elections remain around the corner, Usha told Fox, "There are a few different reasons...One is that I grew up in a religious household. My parents are Hindu, and that was one of the things that made them such good parents, that makes them really very good people. And so I think I've seen that...the power of that in my own life, and I knew that JD was searching for something. This just felt right for him."</p>

<p>The interview was taken three weeks before the announcement of JD Vance as the running mate of Trump in the upcoming US presidential polls.</p>

<p>Vance was born James David Bowman in Middletown, Ohio, to a mother who struggled with addiction and a father who left the family when JD was a toddler. He was raised by his grandparents.</p>

<p>The Trump campaign says the former president, following his brush with death, will call for unity in the face of tragedy instead of criticising his political adversaries as he faces off with President Biden in a 2024 election rematch.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After dodging a bullet at a rally and seeing the US Supreme Court bolster his presidential immunity claims this month, Donald Trump was handed another gift Monday: the dismissal of his classified documents case.</p>

<p>As the only president ever to be twice impeached -- and twice acquitted -- and the country's only ex-president convicted of criminal charges, the septuagenarian has often struggled to stay afloat.</p>

<p>His blunders, multitude of scandals and vitriolic statements have shocked millions of Americans. Many heads of state see him as a danger to global stability and the fight against global warming, and he has stood accused of indulging far-right groups and disparaging immigrants.</p>

<p>But each time he is said to be sunk, he roars back to the surface, and this week he is heading into Milwaukee riding very high.</p>

<p>On Thursday the Republican National Convention will overlook Trump's vows of vengeance against his political enemies and swat aside his various legal woes to formally nominate him as the party's flagbearer going into the November election against President Joe Biden.</p>

<p>Trump, the brash billionaire who burst onto the political landscape a decade ago as a super disruptor and champion of conservatives, appears unstoppable.</p>

<p>"It sure seems he's on a roll," Texas alternate delegate Orlando Dona, wearing Trump pins and a straw-colored cowboy hat, told AFP.</p>

<p>The 64-year-old Dona, like many conservatives, believes the various cases against Trump have been politically motivated, "and he is coming out of all this justified."</p>

<p>As for the shooting, some are chalking it up to divine intervention.</p>

<p>"I personally think it was the hand of God," Wisconsin former governor Scott Walker told AFP at the convention.</p>

<p>Walker, who ran for president against Trump briefly in 2016, said Trump the man has earned a reputation for taking on anything.</p>

<p>"He's never going to stop being a fighter," he said. "And I think people here realize he's fighting for them, and these wins are not just about wins for him, they're wins for the American people."</p>

<p><strong>- 'A lot of obstacles' -</strong></p>

<p>Trump earned the nickname "Teflon Don" for weathering a multitude of storms.</p>

<p>The #MeToo movement precipitated the downfall of dozens of powerful Americans. Not Trump, despite multiple accusations of sexual abuse, a 2023 civil trial finding of liability for the sexual assault of writer E. Jean Carroll, and an alleged affair with pornographic actress Stormy Daniels.</p>

<p>After an explosive "Access Hollywood" tape emerged in 2016 in which Trump makes degrading remarks about women and boasted about groping their genitals, some Republican heavyweights withdrew their support, and he was predicted to lose the female vote.</p>

<p>That collapse didn't happen, and he won the White House a month later.</p>

<p>Now, it appears he will pull off another miracle, avoiding three of the four lawsuits he had been facing before the election.</p>

<p>"If the story of even the last 18 months teaches us anything, there were a lot of obstacles that were put up to president Trump, and the fact that he's gotten through them shows, I think, part of what gives me faith in this country," businessman and former 2024 Vivek Ramaswamy told reporters at the convention.</p>

<p>"As Martin Luther King said, the arc of history is long but it bends towards justice," Ramaswamy said. "I believe that's exactly what it is doing in recent months, days, and over the last year of president Trump's journey as well."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A soldier guarding a major Parisian railway station on Monday was injured in a knife attack by a man who was then arrested, Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said.</p>

<p>The soldier's life was not in danger, Darmanin said on X, while a police source told AFP that he had suffered a shoulder wound.</p>

<p>The attack at the Gare de l'Est station in northern Paris came less than two weeks before the start of the Olympic Games in the French capital.</p>

<p>"Thoughts to the soldier injured tonight at the Gare de l'Est," Armed Forces Minister Sebastien Lecornu wrote on X, paying tribute to the French troops protecting citizens.</p>

<p>He said the soldier was part of a special military operation to protect sensitive sites in Paris that was launched following the 2015 Islamist attacks on the satirical Charlie Hebdo newspaper.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The Republican Party on Monday formally confirmed Donald Trump as its nominee to take on President Joe Biden in November's election.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump won formal nomination Monday as the Republican presidential candidate and picked a right-wing loyalist for running mate, kicking off a triumphalist party convention in the wake of last weekend's failed assassination attempt.</p>

<p>Trump announced 39-year-old Ohio Senator J.D. Vance as his vice presidential pick, rewarding a one-time harsh critic who became one of his most reliable -- and uncompromising -- supporters in Congress.</p>

<p>Trump, 78, is guaranteed a hero's welcome at the convention in Milwaukee, where delegates delivered their formal nomination two days after the scandal-plagued former president survived an assassination attempt at a rally.</p>

<p>"As Vice President, J.D. will continue to fight for our Constitution, stand with our Troops, and will do everything he can to help me MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN," Trump posted on Truth Social.</p>

<p>While Trump is increasingly confident of a shock return to the White House -- despite multiple legal problems and two impeachments during his first term -- President Joe Biden is reeling from weak polls and Democratic concerns over his health.</p>

<p>In the delegates count in Milwaukee, Eric Trump put his father over the threshold on behalf of the Florida delegation, calling him "the greatest president that ever lived."</p>

<p>Vance had been widely expected as Trump's pick. He will bolster the ticket on the right wing, but with less chance of expanding appeal to more moderate voters and women.</p>

<p>The standard-bearer for a new kind of populism that has come to the fore under Trump, Vance is also one of the least experienced VP picks in modern history.</p>

<p>But he embraces the ex-president's isolationist, anti-immigration America First movement. Vance is further to the right than his new boss on many issues including abortion, where he embraces calls for federal legislation.</p>

<p>He initially made his name with the 2016 memoir "Hillbilly Elegy," a best-selling account of his Appalachian family and modest Rust Belt upbringing, which gave a voice to rural, working-class resentment in left-behind America.</p>

<p>Turning his back on previous opposition to Trump, whom he once said might be "America's Hitler," Vance reinvented himself and ultimately won the ex-president's key endorsement in the 2022 Ohio Senate race, launching his meteoric rise.</p>

<p><strong>- 'Supposed to be dead' -</strong></p>

<p>Trump's convention comes as the country is still reeling from a botched attempt by a gunman to kill Trump at a rally in Pennsylvania Saturday.</p>

<p>Some 50,000 Republicans descended on the shores of Lake Michigan for the four-day gathering, four months before election day.</p>

<p>The attempted assassination -- in which one bystander was killed, two more wounded and Trump received a light wound in his ear -- was expected to dominate proceedings.</p>

<p>The Secret Service, which is battling criticism it failed to protect Trump from the shooter, said it was "fully prepared" to ensure security at the convention.</p>

<p>Leading in multiple polls, despite being convicted at his hush-money criminal case in New York, Trump is exuding confidence.</p>

<p>At 81, Biden is facing calls from his own side to quit the race over concerns around his age.</p>

<p>His campaign released a statement saying the Trump-Vance agenda would "take away Americans' rights, hurt the middle class, and make life more expensive -- all while benefiting the ultra-rich and greedy corporations."</p>

<p>Trump scored another victory Monday as a judge dismissed the criminal case against him over accusations he endangered national security by holding on to top secret documents after leaving the White House.</p>

<p>- Message of unity -</p>

<p>He immediately took to Truth Social to call for the dismissal of all legal cases against him, insisting again that he was being targeted for political reasons.</p>

<p>Trump told the New York Post he had "prepared an extremely tough speech" about Biden's "horrible administration" to deliver at the convention.</p>

<p>As some Republicans -- including Vance -- sought to blame Democrats' anti-Trump rhetoric for the attack, Trump also said he hopes to "unite our country."</p>

<p>Still, that would see him have to rein in the instinct to settle scores -- demonstrated by his cry for supporters to "fight" in the seconds after Saturday's attack.</p>

<p>The Milwaukee gathering is largely designed in Trump's image, with digital banners beaming out a message in the cavernous convention arena: "Make America Great Once Again."</p>

<p>The branding reflects his takeover of the party.</p>

<p>A diminished figure after his 2020 election loss and a subsequent riot at the Capitol by his supporters, Trump has spent much of the last four years reshaping Republican politics.</p>

<p>Installing loyalists including his daughter-in-law Lara Trump atop the Republican National Committee, the billionaire has effectively crushed dissent.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Donald Trump selected J.D. Vance, a Republican U.S. senator from Ohio, as his running mate on Monday, elevating a politician who once criticized the former president in acid terms but has since become one of his most stalwart defenders.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump selected J.D. Vance, a Republican U.S. senator from Ohio, as his running mate on Monday, elevating a politician who once criticized the former president in acid terms but has since become one of his most stalwart defenders.</p>

<p>The news, carried on Trump's Truth Social media website, emerged at the start of the four-day Republican National Convention in Milwaukee to nominate the party's presidential ticket.</p>

<p>The selection of James David Vance, author of the bestselling memoir "Hillbilly Elegy," could increase the odds of Trump supporters turning out for the Nov. 5 election as the Ohio native is deeply popular with the Republican candidate's base.</p>

<p>A staunch conservative from a Republican state, Vance is unlikely to bring many new voters into Trump's corner, however, and may even alienate some moderates. Some Trump supporters had pushed him to select a woman or person of color as his No. 2 to expand a coalition that skews toward white men.</p>

<p>The former president, 78, survived an assassination attempt at a Pennsylvania campaign rally on Saturday by a gunman whose motive remains unknown.</p>

<p>Several of Trump's highest-profile backers - including former senior adviser Steve Bannon and Trump's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr. - have praised Vance for pushing the Republican Party to embrace a more hands-off foreign policy approach and for supporting trade barriers.</p>

<p>Vance has also delighted Trump supporters with his confrontational social media presence, a relative rarity in the Senate, where many lawmakers still try to maintain a sense of decorum and civility.</p>

<p>At 39, Vance will represent a younger generation in an election that features Trump and President Joe Biden, 81, bringing a counterweight to the Democratic ticket that also includes Vice President Kamala Harris, 59.</p>

<p>In selecting Vance, Trump passed over other possible contenders such including U.S. Senators Marco Rubio and Tim Scott and North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum.</p>

<p>Vance's rapid ascent has been unusual for American politics. After a troubled and impoverished childhood in southern Ohio, he served in the Marine Corps, won a scholarship to Yale Law School and later worked as a venture capitalist in San Francisco.</p>

<p>He rose to prominence after 2016 when he wrote "Hillbilly Elegy," in which he explored the socioeconomic problems confronting his hometown and the cycle of poverty that had entrapped Americans in the Appalachian Mountains, where his mother and her family had their origins.</p>

<p>The book criticized what Vance saw as a self-destructive culture in rural America and sought to explain Trump's popularity among impoverished white Americans.</p>

<p>Vance himself was harshly critical of Trump before and after Trump's 2016 election win against Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, calling him an "idiot" and "America's Hitler," among other epithets.</p>

<p>But as Vance geared up to run for the U.S. Senate in Ohio in 2022, he transformed into one of the former president's most consistent defenders, supporting Trump even when some Senate colleagues declined to do so.</p>

<p>Vance has played down the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. He said he "doubted" Mike Pence's life was in danger, despite violent protesters getting within yards of the former vice president as Secret Service agents rushed him out of the Capitol building. Vance has also echoed Trump's criticisms of the way the Justice Department has prosecuted Jan. 6 rioters, accusing the department of disregarding due process protections.</p>

<p>In February, he declined to criticize Trump for encouraging Russian President Vladimir Putin to attack America's NATO allies if they failed to increase their defense spending.</p>

<p>While the Republican Party historically stood for free markets and embraced foreign intervention as an important national security tool, Trump's 2016 election opened up significant rifts within the party. Vance has been one of the most vocal opponents of continued aid to Ukraine in the Senate, a stance at odds with many Republican legislative leaders.</p>

<p>On the campaign trail, the former venture capitalist has also served as a bridge between Trump associates and wealthy Silicon Valley donors, many of whom have opened their wallets to Trump this election.</p>

<p>Still, Vance's selection has its detractors among Trump associates, notably those who had wanted Trump to select a diverse vice presidential candidate. Though Trump and Biden are virtually tied in most national polls, Trump trails the Democratic president by significant margins among women and Black Americans.</p>

<p>Some Trump associates privately questioned whether it would be wise to take Vance out of the Senate with Democrats and Republicans vying for control of the upper chamber. Democrats hold a one-seat advantage, though they are likely to lose ground in the November election.</p>

<p>Ohio, while safely Republican in presidential elections, does occasionally elect Democrats in other races. Vance won his 2022 election by six percentage points.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Jason Vechhio, who was 150 steps away from the stage, said that it was a very positive experience until the former president was shot and then a kind of "confusion and fear set in".]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The mood was upbeat and there "didn't seem to be anything wrong at all", Jason Vecchio, a man who attended the Trump campaign rally in Pensylvannia on Saturday, told NDTV. Mr Vechhio, who was 150 steps away from the stage, said that it was a very positive experience until the former president was shot at and then a kind of "confusion and fear set in".</p>

<p>"There didn't seem to be anything wrong at all. We had seen the secret service snipers up on top of the building ... Everybody was laughing, we were dancing before. There were a lot of good vibes going on. Everyone was talking, having nice conversations. There were families, children. There were old people. It was a very positive experience up until then. Nothing made us think that there is going to be any attack," said Mr Vechhio.</p>

<p>The 78-year-old former president was injured but survived an assassination attempt, a brazen attack that shocked a nation already deeply polarized ahead of the November election.</p>

<p>"Those bullets whizzed by him, hit the machine and the boom comes down because it hit a hydraulic line. We see secret service jump on top of him, to shield him and protect him. It wasn't like instantly that we knew what was going on. Definitely sounded like gunfire because I have been around firearms. We get down, heard the gunfire stop. At that point I ran over to the fence, I hopped over the fence and took cover under a police car just because I wasn't sure there was a secondary shooter or if a shooter was in the crowd. No one had any idea where the shooter was. So I just wanted to be in the safest place I could be in.</p>

<p>"And then we all watched Trump stand up and put his fist in the air and we all stood up and started chanting. It was quite an experience. It was quite a moving moment to see him stand up after we all just thought he died. And then I walked over to the fence and walked over to my buddies and together we opened the fence and started funneling everybody through the exit," said Mr Vechhio, recounting what he saw at the event.</p>

<p>Trump was speaking when multiple bangs rang out. He clutched his ear, with blood visible on his ear and cheek, then ducked to the floor as Secret Service agents swarmed onto the podium, surrounding him and rushing him to a nearby vehicle.</p>

<p>"We were definitely confused at first. I think the fear kind of set in a little afterwards. I tried to make sure my friends were safe. After a few hours had passed, it kind of sink in a little more today what the true severity of the whole event was. This will go down in history and will be taught in schools," said Mr Vechhio.</p>

<p>Iconic images of a bloodied Trump waving his fist after the shooting are already galvanizing Republican hopes that voters will further rally behind him for a landslide victory in November.</p>

<p>"Immediately I saw him stand up. I was already standing at that point trying to look for my friends. The crowd was all looking up towards him. I looked up. I see him put his fist up, it was a sight to remember. The man had just got shot. We all thought he was dead. And he stood up and was so like patriotic when he said fight and put his hand up in the air. It was surreal. He wasn't scared. He was like this is my fight, we are going to win. Here we are, I am alive. He was as proud an American as I have ever seen," Mr Vechhio said.</p>

<p>The Secret Service faces intense scrutiny over how a gunman aiming an assault rifle was allowed to take position on a roof some 500 feet (150 meters) from one of the most protected political figures on the planet.</p>

<p>"There's always more to it. There's always stuff. We are going to be finding stuff out in the next few weeks. We've already found out a lot in past 24 hours. But there's always more to the story that is not very obvious. The whole situation was kind of strange that a single person was able to put a ladder up on to a building that was so close. That building had a great vantage point of the whole thing. So why did the Secret Service not secure the building or didn't have a member of the security up on that building to make sure something like this did not happen.</p>

<p>"It is just crazy to me that those security measure were not taken. This is negligent on the part of whoever was making the decisions. And since then we have also heard that, I can't say whether it is true or not, we've heard that the gentleman who had taken the shot had sights on him about three minutes and he was being told not to take the shot... I am looking forward to figure out what the truth is in the next coming days and weeks," said Mr Vechhio casting doubts on the ex president's security detail.</p>

<p>Thomas Crooks, the 20-year-old gunman who opened fire at Trump, was shot dead on the spot by Secret Service snipers. He appears to have acted alone but there's more to the probe, said the FBI.</p>

<p>The spectator who died in the shooting that targeted Trump was identified as Corey Comperatore, a 50-year-old firefighter and father of two.</p>

<p>"It definitely makes me angry. That gentleman was there with his daughter and wife as I was with my friends to show support for a politician that we support and we were having fun. He was there with his loved one showing support for their politician and to lose his life that day I just want to send my most sincere condolences to his family. It's tragic. It's very sad. I wish he still had his life," said Mr Vechhio.</p>

<p>Biden has sought to strike a presidential tone over the shooting, coming out quickly with a message of unity.</p>

<p>"We have been pretty divided over these past few years. Think there is good potential for this current event to actually bring Americans together and make America strong as a country. And bring us the success and make us great again," said Me Vecchio.</p>

<p>Pressed to answer what it is about Trump that he likes, Mr vechhio said, "He always has been a character, he always will be. He's fun to watch. I am definitely looking forward to hear him talk."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>More than 100 students were injured across Bangladesh on Monday in clashes between those protesting to end a quota system for government jobs and others loyal to the ruling party, police and witnesses said.</p>

<p>The protests mark the first significant demonstrations that Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has faced since she won a fourth straight term in an election in January boycotted by the main opposition.</p>

<p>Thousands of anti-quota protesters and members of the student wing of Hasina's Awami League hurled rocks and fought each other with sticks and iron rods at universities across the country, including Dhaka, police and witnesses said.</p>

<p>Students were injured on several campuses, police officials said.</p>

<p>The protesters called for marches and rallies to continue across the country to press their demands.</p>

<p>"This is more than just a student movement. To suppress this movement, incitement from the highest levels of government has been made. So, common people have to come to the streets," said Nahid Islam, the coordinator of the anti-quota protests.</p>

<p>The protests began earlier this month after the High Court ordered the government to restore 30% job quotas for the descendants of freedom fighters. They have continued despite Bangladesh's top court suspending that order for a month last week.</p>

<p>The protests intensified on Sunday night after Hasina refused to meet the students' demands, stating that the issue was now before the court.</p>

<p>Hasina said those who oppose job quotas for relatives of freedom fighters are the 'Razakar', which collaborated with the Pakistani army during the 1971 War of Independence. Her comments led thousands of students to leave their dormitories on the Dhaka University campus at midnight to protest.</p>

<p>"An attempt is being made to transform the anti-quota movement into an anti-state one using the emotions of young students," said Foreign Minister Hasan Mahmud. "The government will not allow an unstable situation to develop."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The government on Monday hiked the windfall tax on domestically produced crude oil to Rs 7,000 per tonne, from Rs 6,000 per tonne.</p>

<p>The tax is levied in the form of Special Additional Excise Duty (SAED).</p>

<p>The SAED on the export of diesel, petrol and jet fuel or ATF, has been retained at 'nil'.</p>

<p>The new rates are effective from July 16, an official notification said.</p>

<p>India first imposed windfall profit taxes on July 1, 2022, joining a host of nations that tax supernormal profits of energy companies.

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Apple's shares rose 2.5% to a record high on Monday after Morgan Stanley raised its price target on the iPhone maker's shares and designated the stock as a "top pick," citing the company's AI efforts as a boost to device sales.</p>

<p>In what was seen as a move to catch up with Alphabet's Google and Microsoft-backed OpenAI, the iPad maker last month unveiled Apple Intelligence, luring customers to upgrade their devices to be able to use the new technology.</p>

<p>Apple's shares, which have jumped nearly 20% this year, rose to $236.30, giving the company a market value of $3.62 trillion, the highest in the world.</p>

<p>"Apple Intelligence is a clear catalyst to boost iPhone and iPad shipments," Morgan Stanley analysts said.</p>

<p>The new technology is compatible with only 8% of iPhone and iPad devices and Apple has 1.3 billion units of smartphones currently in use by customers, the analysts said, adding that the company could sell nearly 500 million iPhones over the next two years.</p>

<p>Morgan Stanley, which previously expected Apple to sell between 230 million and 235 million iPhones annually over the next two years, raised its price target on the company's shares to $273 from $216.</p>

<p>The stock has an average rating of "buy" with a median price target of $217, and has outperformed the S&amp;P 500 index this year, according to LSEG data.</p>

<p>Industry analysts expect Samsung and Apple to lead the charge in global smartphone market recovery this year given the buzz around GenAI-enabled smartphones.</p>

<p>Apple sold 45.2 million smartphones globally in the three months ending June, up from 44.5 million a year earlier, but its market share fell to 15.8% from 16.6% in the same period, according to IDC data.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Scientists have found evidence for an accessible cave conduit beneath the moon's surface. The location of the underground cave is not far from Apollo 11's landing site. It's 250 miles (400 kilometers) from where Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin landed 55 years ago.</p>

<p>Researchers analysed radar measurements by NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, and compared the results with lava tubes on Earth. Their findings appeared in the journal <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-024-02302-y.epdf?sharing_token=DmQt9tO2f0EhQ_htee77wdRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0NM3XCoO8qqQAVpZqycEJ41v-Y1i8jue3aIH5QvXVkwNKM1VU1zJ66l13rexlhrvWyR1SrF_fl-osl851IG6owAa0mBcJWiYLUEFsYJHaDQToCmPmK9-zmmu3ISDRCd_-bbjc6mWGjLESX0dlosaOO6ajSxqNLEsAwtOYQWjRSDZUas1FsiA_ba07AU0JoJn7TrUFfzNVCqnuk84kIxwY2jwOTbMazxswZY2EG7dQTfD1SvRhx_8EIghgsSVe7Iq-gYPofeRd77R9YDcYTXaGQVnz2CpWIxs9d3_oHWLfgaj9TrjR1kBhEgeYbu-Ocy8JU%3D&amp;tracking_referrer=www.theguardian.com">Nature Astronomy</a>.</p>

<p>The finding suggests that the cave is a "promising site for a lunar base" as it offers shelter from the harsh surface environment and could support long-term human exploration of the Moon.</p>

<p>The cave is accessible from the deepest known pit on the moon. It's located at the Mare Tranquillitatis (Sea of Tranquility)</p>

<p>The pit, like the more than 200 others discovered up there, was created by the collapse of a lava tube.</p>

<p>NASA is aiming to build a semi-permanent crewed base on the moon, China and Russia have also announced interest in creating lunar research outposts. But, a permanent lunar base can only be set up in environments protected from cosmic radiation and with stable temperatures.</p>

<p>Such caves could form an emergency lunar shelter because the astronauts would be naturally shielded from harmful cosmic rays, solar radiation and micrometeorites.</p>

<p>Lunar orbiters first spotted pits on the moon more than a decade ago. Many are thought to be "skylights" that connect to underground caves such as lava tubes, giant underground tunnels that form through volcanic processes, reported <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/article/2024/jul/15/underground-cave-found-on-moon-could-be-ideal-base-for-explorers">The Guardian</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Iranian newspaper Tehran Times reported online that Iranian diplomats had left the embassy before it was attacked, citing foreign ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baqaei.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iran's embassy in Syria was "attacked" on Sunday, Iranian state TV said, after Islamist-led rebels declared the fall of Tehran ally Bashar al-Assad following a sweeping offensive that culminated in Damascus.</p>

<p>"Unknown individuals have attacked the Iranian embassy, as you can see in these images shared by various networks," a state TV broadcaster said, showing footage from Al Arabiya, said to be from the diplomatic compound.</p>

<p>Iranian newspaper Tehran Times reported online that Iranian diplomats had left the embassy before it was stormed, citing foreign ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baqaei.</p>

<p>The report said that all embassy staff were safe.</p>

<p>It also accused rebel forces of being behind the attack, a claim that could not be independently verified immediately.</p>

<p>Authorities in Iran have yet to comment on Assad's fall.</p>

<p>On Saturday, as the rebels pressed their lightning offensive but had not yet taken Damascus, Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi called on "the Syrian government and legitimate opposition groups" to enter negotiations.</p>

<p>His remarks marked a shift in Tehran's tone towards rebel groups which Iran had previously called "terrorists" and refused to recognise them as legitimate actors.</p>

<p>Araghchi visited Damascus on December 1, days into the rebels' offensive, meeting with Assad in the Syrian leader's last public appearance alongside an Iranian official.</p>

<p>A day later, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian reiterated Tehran's support in a telephone call with Assad.</p>

<p>The deposed Syrian leader last visited Iran in May 2024, shortly after the death of former president Ebrahim Raisi in a helicopter crash.</p>

<p>Iran has supported Damascus during Syria's civil war, which began in 2011, sending "military advisers" at Assad's request.</p>

<p>Numerous Iranian Revolutionary Guards commanders have been killed in Syria, in combat and in Israeli strikes against presumed Iranian-linked targets.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Syria should have an 18 month transition period to establish "a safe, neutral, and quiet environment" for free elections, Hadi Al-Bahra, the head of Syria's main opposition abroad, said to Reuters on the sidelines of the Doha Forum on Sunday.</p>

<p>In a seismic moment for the Middle East, Syrian rebels seized control of Damascus on Sunday, forcing President Bashar al-Assad to flee after more than 13 years of civil war, ending his family's decades-long rule.</p>

<p>The lightning offensive sparked concerns in Arab capitals and raised fears of a new wave of regional instability, as well as questions over whether the rebels will be able to ensure an orderly transition.</p>

<p>Al-Bahra, President of the Syrian National Coalition, said Syria should draft a constitution within six months, on which the first election would be a referendum.</p>

<p>"The constitution will say, are we going to have a parliamentary system, presidential system, or mixed system? And based on this, we do the election and the people choose their leader," said Al-Bahra.</p>

<p>He added that the opposition had asked state employees to continue to report to work until the power transition, and assured them that they would not be harmed.</p>

<p>Assad's swift toppling followed a shift in the balance of power in the Middle East after many leaders of Lebanon's Iranian-backed Hezbollah group, a lynchpin of Assad's battlefield force, were killed by Israel over the past two months. Russia, Assad's other key ally, has been focused on the war in Ukraine.</p>

<p>"It was like a domino effect. So it was clear that (Assad) decided to leave. I felt relief, but also a little sad. He should be held accountable for all the crimes that he did," Al-Bahra said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA["Ukrainians want peace more than anyone else. Russia brought war to our land, and it is Russia that most seeks to disrupt the possibility of peace," Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky said.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky said Sunday he told US President-elect Donald Trump Kyiv needed an "enduring" peace that Russia will not "destroy" in the future, after they met in Paris for talks on the almost three-year war.</p>

<p>Trump had earlier said Zelensky was keen for a "deal" and called for a start of negotiations.</p>

<p>The pair met a day earlier with French leader Emmanuel Macron at the Elysee.</p>

<p>Trump has boasted he could end the conflict swiftly without saying how and both Moscow and Kyiv are readying for his arrival in the White House, with the dragging conflict seeing an escalation in deadly attacks in recent weeks.</p>

<p>"I stated that we need a just and enduring peace -- one that the Russians will not be able to destroy in a few years, as they have done repeatedly in the past," Zelensky said on social media.</p>

<p>Almost three years of war have ravaged Ukraine, leaving thousands dead and millions fleeing the country.</p>

<p>"Ukrainians want peace more than anyone else. Russia brought war to our land, and it is Russia that most seeks to disrupt the possibility of peace," he said.</p>

<p>He called on Western allies not to "turn a blind eye to occupation" and said Kyiv would only agree to a deal that will bring long-term peace.</p>

<p>"War cannot be endless -- only peace must be permanent and reliable," he said.</p>

<p>In a rare admission of numbers, Zelensky said 43,000 Ukrainian troops had been killed in combat, while some 370,000 were wounded.</p>

<p>Both sides are believed to have suffered massive casualties and that figure is believed to be far higher.</p>

<p><strong>'Key conditions' discussed</strong></p>

<p>Zelensky gave no concrete details on key aspects of what negotiations could look like, but a senior Ukrainian official said they had discussed "some key conditions" for ending the war.</p>

<p>"We are not disclosing details, but the presidents discussed at the meeting that there should be something that would guarantee the reliability of the peace," the source said.</p>

<p>The Kremlin, meanwhile, accused Ukraine of "refusing" to negotiate an end to the war and said its conditions to enter peace talks -- which include Kyiv giving up four regions -- remain unchanged.</p>

<p>"The Ukrainian side refused and is refusing negotiation," Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.</p>

<p>He referred to a 2022 Ukrainian decree that ruled out talks with Putin, but not other Russian officials.</p>

<p>Trump had earlier called for an "immediate ceasefire" and called for talks to begin.</p>

<p>"Too many lives are being so needlessly wasted, too many families destroyed, and if it keeps going, it can turn into something much bigger, and far worse," he wrote on his Truth Social platform.</p>

<p>Trump has touted himself as having good relations with Putin.</p>

<p><strong>'How long can we be at war?</strong></p>

<p>But as leaders made statements in Kyiv, Moscow and Paris, the situation on the ground in eastern Ukraine remained dire.</p>

<p>Moscow claimed another village in the east -- Blagodatne in the Donetsk region -- on Sunday, pressing steady gains.</p>

<p>Many in Ukraine have feared that Trump taking office would force it to make heart-aching concessions to Russia, while the nation is also suffering exhaustion.</p>

<p>In the village of Osynovo in the eastern Kharkiv region, news of the meeting between Trump and Zelensky offered some hope to one of the frontline village's last remaining residents, Mykola Lytvynov.</p>

<p>Cleaning earth from vegetables in his backyard, the 80-year-old said he hoped the meeting could help bring about a negotiated end to the conflict.</p>

<p>"How long can we be at war? So many people have been killed, so many young people. And you see the massive level of destruction," he told AFP.</p>

<p>He suggested Ukraine could have retained more of its territory by already entering into talks with Russia, but said he hoped for an end to the fighting for another, personal reason.</p>

<p>"Both my sons are fighting. I just want them to survive."</p>

<p>Ukraine also said that two civilians were killed in the Donetsk region and that seven people were wounded by attacks in the southern Kherson region.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Groups of Syrians strolled through the palaces of President Bashar al-Assad on Sunday following his ouster, wandering from room to room, posing for photographs, and with some taking items of furniture or ornaments.</p>

<p>Video obtained by Reuters showed people entering the Al-Rawda Presidential Palace, as children ran through the grand rooms and men slid a large trunk across the ornate floor.</p>

<p>Several men carried smart chairs over their shoulders. In a storeroom, cupboards had been ransacked and objects strewn across the floor.</p>

<p>Video of another palace, the Muhajreen Palace, verified by Reuters, showed groups of men and women walking across a white marble floor and through tall wooden doors. A man carried a vase in his hand, and a large cabinet stood empty with its doors ajar.</p>

<p>Syrian rebels seized control of Damascus on Sunday, forcing Assad to flee and ending his family's decades of rule after more than 13 years of civil war in a seismic moment for the Middle East.</p>

<p>Assad, who had not spoken in public since the sudden rebel advance a week ago, flew out of Damascus for an unknown destination earlier on Sunday, two senior army officers told Reuters, as rebels said they had entered the capital with no sign of army deployments.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Islamist-led rebels toppled Syria's longtime ruler Bashar al-Assad in a lightning offensive that a UN envoy called "a watershed moment" for the nation marred by civil war.</p>

<p>Here are key reactions from around the world:</p>

<p><strong>'Return to stability': China</strong></p>

<p>Beijing "is closely following the development of the situation in Syria and hopes that Syria returns to stability as soon as possible", the foreign ministry said.</p>

<p><strong>'Time for unity': France</strong></p>

<p>Welcoming Assad's ouster, France called on Syrians to "reject all forms of extremism".</p>

<p>"While the (Assad) regime has never ceased to pit Syrians against each other, and Syria is fractured and fragmented, the time for unity has come," foreign affairs minister spokesman Christophe Lemoine said, urging a peaceful political transition.</p>

<p><strong>'Full protection for minorities': Germany</strong></p>

<p>"The country must not now fall into the hands of other radicals, whatever form they take," German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said.</p>

<p>She urged "full protection for ethnic and religious minorities such as Kurds, Alawites or Christians" and political inclusivity.</p>

<p><strong>'Political dialogue': Iran</strong></p>

<p>Diplomats from Assad ally Iran were reported to have left the embassy in Damascus before it was attacked by "unknown individuals" on Sunday, Iranian state TV said.</p>

<p>Their departure followed calls by Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi on Saturday for "political dialogue" between the Syrian government and opposition groups.</p>

<p><strong>'Country in turmoil': Turkey</strong></p>

<p>Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said the overthrow of the Assad regime was not sudden but rather the result of the grinding civil war.</p>

<p>"Of course, this didn't happen overnight. For the last 13 years, the country has been in turmoil," Fidan said at conference in Doha.</p>

<p><strong>'Work together': UAE</strong></p>

<p>A senior United Arab Emirates official urged Syrians on Sunday to collaborate in order to avert a spiral into chaos.</p>

<p>"We hope that the Syrians will work together, that we don't just see another episode of impending chaos," presidential adviser Anwar Gargash said at the Manama Dialogue in Bahrain.</p>

<p><strong>'Political solution': UK</strong></p>

<p>Britain's Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner told Sky News that while Assad "wasn't exactly good" to the Syrian people, "we need stability in that region".</p>

<p>"Dictatorship and terrorism creates problems for the people of Syria, who have faced so much already," she said. "That's why we have to have a political solution where the government is acting in the interests of the Syrian people."</p>

<p><strong>'Cautious hope': UN</strong></p>

<p>The UN envoy for Syria called the rebel takeover "a watershed moment" for the country marred by nearly 14 years of civil war.</p>

<p>"Today we look forward with cautious hope to the opening of a new (chapter) -- one of peace, reconciliation, dignity and inclusion for all Syrians," special envoy Geir Pedersen said.</p>

<p><strong>'Russia not interested any longer': Trump</strong></p>

<p>US President-elect Donald Trump attributed the fall of Assad to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/russia-was-not-interested-in-protecting-syrias-assad-donald-trump-7200470" target="_blank">losing the backing of Russia</a>.</p>

<p>"Assad is gone," he said on his Truth Social platform. "His protector, Russia, Russia, Russia, led by Vladimir Putin, was not interested in protecting him any longer."</p>

<p>His comments followed an earlier statement from National Security Council spokesman Sean Savett that President Joe Biden was keeping a close eye on "extraordinary events" transpiring and remained in constant contact with regional partners.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Hundreds of Syrians celebrated the fall of long-time ruler Bashar al-Assad in joyous scenes on Sunday outside the Fatih Mosque in central Istanbul, one of the focal points for their 500,000-strong Syrian community in the Turkish city.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hundreds of Syrians celebrated the fall of long-time ruler Bashar al-Assad in joyous scenes on Sunday outside the Fatih Mosque in central Istanbul, one of the focal points for their 500,000-strong Syrian community in the Turkish city.</p>

<p>Turkey has become home for millions of Syrians who fled since civil war erupted in their home nation in 2011.</p>

<p>"I didn't expect it to happen one day, not even in three centuries. No one was expecting this. This is a huge victory for us," said Mohamad Cuma, a student who arrived from the northern Syrian city of Aleppo three years ago.</p>

<p>"It's incredible. It's like we've been born again," said Sawsan al-Ahmad, holding her young son by the hand.</p>

<p>Ahmad lived through the first few months of the siege of the strategic city of Homs.</p>

<p>She said she was delighted to be able to take her son to her "home soil", now that Assad has fallen after a lightning offensive by Islamist-led rebels.</p>

<p>Rebel group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham and allied factions seized swathes of Syria from government hands, including the cities of Aleppo, Hama and Homs in an offensive that started November 27.</p>

<p>Early on Sunday they entered the capital, Damascus, declaring the demise of an Assad dynasty that had ruled Syria with an iron fist for five decades.</p>

<p>Behind Ahmad, hundreds of Syrians chanted "Allahu akhbar" ("God is greatest").</p>

<p>Some waved Syrian opposition flags and called for Assad to be executed.</p>

<p>In the middle of the jubilant throng, whose chanting could be heard hundreds of metres (yards) away, a man waved a portrait of Abdel-Basset al-Sarout, a former Syrian football star who became a rebel fighter and was killed in 2019 in clashes with Assad's forces.</p>

<p><strong>'He'll end up in hell'</strong></p>

<p>"Today is a day of huge celebration for us Syrians," said 42-year-old Ibrahim al-Mohamed, one of the three million Syrian refugees living in neighbouring Turkey.</p>

<p>"My son became handicapped because of Assad," he said, his eyes red and his voice cracking with emotion.</p>

<p>"We were living in Aleppo and a bomb was dropped on the building next door. My son was traumatised. He lost the ability to speak. He's 13 now and just starting to get a little bit better."</p>

<p>"God be praised. We're rid of Assad," said Ahmed Mohamad, a teacher of the Koran who came to Turkey from Aleppo 11 years ago after defecting from the Syrian army.</p>

<p>"If God wills, he'll be decapitated," added an onlooker, drawing his thumb across his throat.</p>

<p>Cuma said he didn't care what became of Assad.</p>

<p>"It's enough that he's gone," he said.</p>

<p>"He can go to live in Russia, in Belarus, in Venezuela, wherever the hell he wants to go. Let him go because he's going to end up in hell."</p>

<p>Cuma said he expected the whole of Syria would "be unified under one flag" and predicted 50 percent of Syrian refugees in Turkey would return home.</p>

<p>He said the reported fall of the Assad regime had altered his personal plans.</p>

<p>"Well, my plan before this week was to pursue a Masters (degree) in the UK," explained the civil engineering student at Istanbul's prestigious Bogazici University.</p>

<p>"But now I think I could be a benefit for Syria's future and reconstruction. So most probably I'll go back."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[After the United Arab Emirates (UAE) mandated stricter requirements for tourist visa applications for Dubai, Indians looking to visit the Gulf city are reportedly witnessing an unprecedented rise in visa rejections.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After the United Arab Emirates (UAE) mandated stricter requirements for tourist visa applications for Dubai, Indians looking to visit the Gulf city are reportedly witnessing an unprecedented rise in visa rejections. Earlier, almost 99 per cent of Dubai visa applications were approved, but now even the most meticulously prepared requests are being rejected by the UAE authorities, according to a report by Times of India.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Recently, Dubai's emigration department introduced stricter requirements for tourist visas, mandating travellers to provide hotel booking documents with QR codes and a copy of their return tickets. For travellers staying with relatives, additional proof of accommodation is needed by the latter.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Rise In Dubai Visa Rejections</strong></h2>

<p>As per the report, since the new visa rules for Dubai came into force, at least 5-6 applications out of 100 are being rejected daily. &nbsp;</p>

<p>"Earlier, the rejection rate for Dubai visas was just 1-2%. This is before the new rules were enforced. We are now getting at least 5-6 visa rejections per day from nearly 100 applications daily. Even when confirmed flight tickets and hotel stay details are attached, the visa applications are being rejected," Nikhil Kumar, director of Passio Travels Pvt Ltd told TOI.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The move is creating uncertainty among travellers, who are facing financial losses not just on visa fees, but also pre-booked flight tickets and hotel reservations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We are seeing unprecedented rejection rates (for tourist visa applications to Dubai). Earlier, almost 99 per cent of Dubai visa applications were approved. Now, we are experiencing rejections even for well-prepared travellers," said Rishikesh Pujari, director of Vihar Travels, according to the TOI report.</p>

<p>He said even the most meticulously prepared application, with all relevant documents like confirmed hotel bookings and flight details, attacked with it, is being rejected. "I had a family of four who meticulously prepared their application. Despite this, their visa application was rejected," he said.</p>

<p>Vijay Thakkar, director of Hasmukh Travels, told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/visa-rejections-for-indian-tourists-soar-as-dubai-tightens-entry-rules/articleshow/116087560" rel="no follow, no index" target="_blank">TOI</a> that two of their passengers, who were planning to stay with their relatives in Dubai, recently had their Dubai visa applications rejected.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"While applying for the visa, we had attached all the relevant documents as per the new visa requirements. Yet, their applications were rejected. This resulted in significant monetary loss for the passengers, as they had spent nearly Rs 14,000 on visa fees, and ticket cancellation cost was another Rs 20,000 and more," he said.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Dubai's New Visa Policy</strong></h2>

<p>The UAE has recently introduced a new policy, under which travellers are required to submit hotel booking documents and return tickets on the emigration department's website when applying for a visa. These documents were previously only required if asked by airport officers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Moreover, tourists are also required to provide proof that they have sufficient financial resources to stay in the city. Applicants must at least have AED 5,000 (approximately Rs 1.14 lakh) in their credit or debit accounts for a two-month visa, and AED 3,000 for a three-month visa.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The UN envoy for Syria said the country was at "a watershed moment" on Sunday after rebels declared they had taken the capital, Damascus.</p>

<p>Describing Syria's drawn-out civil war as a "dark chapter (that) has left deep scars", special envoy Geir Pedersen said: "Today we look forward with cautious hope to the opening of a new one -- one of peace, reconciliation, dignity and inclusion for all Syrians".</p>

<p>"Today marks a watershed moment in Syria's history -- a nation that has endured nearly 14 years of relentless suffering and unspeakable loss," he said, extending his "deepest solidarity to all who have borne the weight of death, destruction, detention and untold human rights violations".</p>

<p></p>

<p>President Bashar al-Assad's reported flight from Damascus comes less than two weeks after the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) launched a lightning offensive challenging more than five decades of domination by the Assad family.</p>

<p>Assad had ruled Syria since 2000, when he inherited power from his father.</p>

<p>Since 2011, he had overseen a crackdown on the democracy movement, which began with peaceful protests.</p>

<p>The Assad government's repression of the protests morphed into one of the bloodiest wars of the century, killing hundreds of thousands of people and displacing millions.</p>

<p>Pedersen acknowledged in a statement that "the challenges ahead remain immense", stressing however: "This is a moment to embrace the possibility of renewal... (and) a path toward a united and peaceful Syria."</p>

<p>The UN special envoy emphasised "the clear desire expressed by millions of Syrians that stable and inclusive transitional arrangements are put in place, that Syrian institutions continue to function".</p>

<p>He said the Syrian people should be helped to realise their "legitimate aspirations... (to) restore a unified Syria".</p>

<p>The statement said Pedersen had heard from many Syrians, including armed groups and civil society organisations, and had noted "a will to protect their fellow Syrians... against retribution and harm".</p>

<p>He appealed to all armed parties to "maintain... law and order, protect civilians and preserve public institutions".</p>

<p>He urged Syrians "to prioritise dialogue, unity and respect for international humanitarian law and human rights as they seek to rebuild their society".</p>

<p>"There must be a collective effort to secure peace and dignity for all."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said on Sunday that Syria's new administration must be inclusive because Syrian people would determine their own future after the ousting of President Bashar al-Assad by rebels.</p>

<p>Syrian rebels declared Assad's ouster after seizing control of Damascus on Sunday, ending his family's iron-fisted rule after more than 13 years of civil war.</p>

<p>In a press conference in Doha, Fidan said the Syrian people were not in a position to rebuild on their own and international actors and regional powers had to act with prudence and preserve the country's territorial integrity.</p>

<p>Terrorist organisations must not be allowed to take advantage of the situation, he added.</p>

<p>"As of this morning, Syria has reached a stage where Syrian people will shape the future of their own country. Today there is hope," Fidan said.</p>

<p>"The new (Syrian) administration must be established in an orderly manner, the principle of inclusiveness must never be compromised, there must never be a desire for revenge... It is time to unite and reconstruct the country," he added.</p>

<p>Asked about the whereabouts of Assad, Fidan said he believed he was out of the country.</p>

<p>He said, Turkey had no contact with Assad despite a call from President Tayyip Erdogan to hold normalisation talks, after years of animosity. Fidan added Ankara had reached out to Assad but all efforts had failed.</p>

<p>Turkey has said it did not support the rebel operation in northern Syria, and that Assad's refusal to engage in a serious political solution had triggered his downfall.</p>

<p>Fidan also said that chemical weapons and related materials should be secured, and that Turkey - host to some 3 million migrants from Syria - had started work on their return.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Turkey-backed Syrian forces entered the northern Syrian city of Manbij after taking control of most of the surrounding area from US-allied Kurdish forces there, a Turkish security source said on Sunday.</p>

<p>The operation comes after Syrian rebels in the south declared President Bashar al-Assad's ouster after seizing control of Damascus.</p>

<p>"The fight against the YPG/PKK is very close to victory. Both air and land interventions are ongoing to take Manbij from the hands of the YPG/PKK," the source said, referring to the Kurdish militia which has long been in control of Manbij.</p>

<p>The source subsequently said the rebel forces were in the city of Manbij itself. There was no immediate comment from Kurdish forces in the city, some 30 km (19 miles) south of the Turkish border and to the west of the Euphrates river.</p>

<p>Syrian rebels earlier said they had started an attack on Manbij, according to a statement posted on Sunday but dated Dec. 7 (Saturday) on X by the Ministry of Defense of the Syrian Interim Government.</p>

<p>The YPG has been a central element of US-allied forces in a coalition against Islamic State militants. Ankara says the YPG is a terrorist group, closely tied to Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) militants who have fought the Turkish state for 40 years.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Islamist-led rebels declared they had taken Damascus in a lightning offensive on Sunday, sending President Bashar al-Assad fleeing and ending five decades of Baath rule in Syria.</p>

<p>A video circulating on social media shows rebels roaming inside the presidential palace in the capital Damascus. They were seen smashing Assad's family portraits in the presidential palace.</p>

<p>Residents in the Syrian capital were seen cheering in the streets, as the rebel factions heralded the departure of "tyrant" Assad, saying: "We declare the city of Damascus free."</p>

<p>AFPTV images from Damascus showed rebels firing into the air at sunrise, with some flashing the victory sign and crying "Allahu akbar", or God is greatest.</p>

<p>Some climbed atop a tank in celebration, while others defaced a toppled statue of Assad's father, Hafez. "I can't believe I'm living this moment," tearful Damascus resident Amer Batha told AFP by phone. "We've been waiting a long time for this day," he said, adding: "We are starting a new history for Syria."</p>

<p>The president's alleged departure, which was also reported by a war monitor, comes less than two weeks after the Islamist Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) group launched its campaign challenging more than five decades of rule by the Assad family.</p>

<p>"After 50 years of oppression under Baath rule, and 13 years of crimes and tyranny and (forced) displacement... we announce today the end of this dark period and the start of a new era for Syria," the rebel factions said on Telegram.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Mohammed al-Jalali said he was ready to cooperate with "any leadership chosen by the Syrian people".</p>

<p>HTS is rooted in the Syrian branch of Al-Qaeda. Proscribed as a terrorist organisation by Western governments, it has sought to soften its image in recent years, and told minority groups living in areas they now control not to worry.</p>

<p>Since the offensive began, at least 826 people, mostly combatants but also including 111 civilians, have been killed. The United Nations said the violence has displaced 370,000 people.</p>

<p>US President-elect Donald Trump posted on his Truth Social platform that "Assad is gone", adding: "His protector, Russia, Russia, Russia, led by Vladimir Putin, was not interested in protecting him any longer."</p>

<p>Assad was for years propped up by Russia and Iran, while Turkey has historically backed the opposition.</p>

<p>Outgoing US Secretary of State Antony Blinken had called on Friday for a "political solution to the conflict", in a call with Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tens of thousands of homes across the UK were left without power on Saturday and two people were killed after Storm Darragh hit the country with strong winds and caused pre-Christmas travel disruption.</p>

<p>Darragh, the fourth named storm of the season, is also expected to bring heavy rain through the weekend, with the UK's Environment Agency issuing dozens of flood warnings.</p>

<p>Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds told Sky News on Saturday the storm posed a "challenging situation".</p>

<p>Two men were killed as a result of trees falling on their cars in separate incidents in Lancashire, northwest England, and in the west Midlands.</p>

<p>In Wales, the Met Office estimated gusts of up to 150 kilometres per hour (93 miles per hour), with a "major incident" declared in parts of Wales due to the extensive disruption.</p>

<p>The storm has had "very significant effects in many parts of Wales, including on transport, energy infrastructure and property", the Welsh devolved leader said in a statement, warning that the effects could be "felt for some days yet".</p>

<p>As of Saturday afternoon 177,000 homes in England, Scotland and Wales were without power, according to the Energy Networks Association.</p>

<p>Trains were disrupted or suspended on several routes including from Glasgow to Edinburgh in Scotland, and between Cambridge and Stansted Airport in eastern England. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Rail operator CrossCountry, which operates nationwide, put a "do not travel" notice in place for Saturday due to cancellations and severe delays.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Network Rail Wales suspended trains on the Welsh northern coast due to a "fallen tree blocking the line", and several bridges in southern England and Wales were closed for safety reasons.</p>

<p>In Northern Ireland, thousands were left without power, and several bus and train services were suspended or delayed.</p>

<p>Christmas markets and sporting events were postponed, including the Merseyside derby between Premier League leaders Liverpool and Everton.</p>

<p>In Ireland, which issued an "orange" wind warning, 175,000 homes were without electricity as of Saturday evening, according to ESB Networks, which said there was "widespread and extensive damage to electricity infrastructure".</p>

<p>Dublin Airport said "a number of flights scheduled for Saturday morning have been cancelled by airlines" due to the storm.</p>

<p>Darragh comes two weeks after Storm Bert battered much of Britain, causing "devastating" flooding in parts of Wales and knocking out power to thousands of homes in Ireland.</p>

<p>The UK's Met Office had issued a rare red alert for high winds overnight to Saturday morning (0300 to 1100 GMT) covering parts of Wales and southwest England.</p>

<p>A separate amber warning, which is less serious than the red alert but still flags a "potential risk to life and property", covering a larger stretch of the UK and Northern Ireland is in place until Saturday night.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Syrian opposition flag was unfurled at the Syrian embassy in Athens on Sunday, hours after Islamist-led rebels declared they had taken Damascus, ending the rule of President Bashar al-Assad.</p>

<p>Greek state news agency ANA said at least three men had entered the embassy and unfurled the flag, which was seen hanging from the roof of the building.</p>

<p>Officers were sent to the scene and three men was detained, it added.</p>

<p>The police did not respond to AFP requests for comment.</p>

<p>One man was seen on an embassy balcony clutching a portrait of Assad and shouting "dictator".</p>

<p>Syrians who fled to Greece when the Assad regime was installed in 1970 came to the embassy to celebrate.</p>

<p>"The dictator escaped. It is over... A new dawn rises for Syria," said Maarouf Alobeid, a cardiologist who has lived in Greece for four decades.</p>

<p>"I came running from my home... The thirst of the Syrian people for freedom, for democracy... cannot be described," he said.</p>

<p>"Twenty-four million Syrians didn't sleep all night," said Nader Halbouni, a senior official from the Syrian community in Greece.</p>

<p>A gathering by Syrians in Greece was scheduled for later on Sunday.</p>

<p>Tens of thousands of Syrians fled to Greece in the 2015 mass migration wave, most of them aiming to reach Germany and other wealthy European Union states. According to the migration ministry, over 15,000 Syrians currently have residence permits in Greece.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President-elect Donald Trump said on Sunday that Russia's abandonment of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad led to his downfall, adding Moscow never should have protected him in the first place and then lost interest because of a war in Ukraine that never should have started.</p>

<p>"Assad is gone. He has fled his country. His protector, Russia, Russia, Russia, led by (President) Vladimir Putin, was not interested in protecting him any longer," Trump wrote on his social media platform Truth Social.</p>

<p><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" class="truthsocial-embed" src="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/113615912452824634/embed" style="max-width: 100%; border: 0" width="600"></iframe><script src="https://truthsocial.com/embed.js" async="async"></script></p>

<p>"There was no reason for Russia to be there in the first place," Trump wrote. "They lost all interest in Syria because of Ukraine ... a war that should never have started, and could go on forever."</p>

<p>Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20, added that Russia and Iran, Assad's other main backer, "are in a weakened state right now, one because of Ukraine and a bad economy, the other because of Israel and its fighting success".</p>

<p>Trump, who has said he will seek to halt the Ukraine war rapidly, met Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Saturday in Paris where they were both attending a ceremony to reopen Notre-Dame Cathedral.</p>

<p>He said Russia and Ukraine had both suffered hundreds of thousands of dead and wounded troops, and Ukraine had also lost many civilians. He added the Ukrainian leader "would like to make a deal and stop the madness ... There should be an immediate ceasefire and negotiations should begin".</p>

<p>"I know Vladimir well. This is his time to act. China can help. The World is waiting!"</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 20-year-old Indian-origin man who was working as a security guard was shot dead by a gang in Canada's Edmonton on Friday.</p>

<p>The Edmonton Police Service (EPS) has arrested two individuals and charged them with first-degree murder of the Indian-origin man, Harshandeep Singh.</p>

<p>The CCTV footage timestamp shows the murder took place on Friday.</p>

<p>According to the police, on Friday night, at around 12:30 am, they responded to a report of a gunshot inside an apartment building. Upon reaching 107 Avenue, they found an unresponsive body in a stairwell and immediately performed first aid. Mr Singh was taken to the hospital where he was declared dead.</p>

<p>CCTV footage doing rounds of the internet shows an individual from the three-member gang pushing Mr Singh down the stairs while the other shoots him from behind.</p>

<p>Evan Rain and Judith Saulteaux, both 30, have been arrested and charged with first-degree murder. Police have recovered a weapon. An autopsy is scheduled for Monday.</p>

<p>“The EPS doesn't typically release the name of a deceased individual unless the death has been confirmed to be a homicide,” EPS Homicide Staff Sgt. Rob Bilawey said in a press release. “However, in this instance, we are releasing his name for an investigative purpose and in an effort to alleviate public safety concerns in relation to Mr Singh's unfortunate death.”</p>

<p>This is the second murder in a week.</p>

<p>Earlier on Sunday (December 1), <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/indian-student-fatally-stabbed-in-canada-during-altercation-with-housemate-7191930" target="_blank">Gurasis Singh, 22, a first-year business management student at Lambton College, was stabbed to death</a> in Canada's Ontario by his housemate. The accused, 36-year-old Crossley Hunter, has been charged with second-degree murder.</p>

<p>According to the Sarnia Police Service, on December 1, at 4:59 am, they received a call, reporting a stabbing incident. The investigation revealed that the two men were involved in a physical altercation while in the kitchen. During the argument, Mr Hunter picked a knife and stabbed Mr Singh, multiple times, killing him.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[South Korea's leadership crisis deepened on Sunday as the country's main opposition party said that it would try again to impeach President Yoon Suk Yeol after his short-lived attempt to impose martial law. Mr Yoon averted impeachment late Saturday.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<ol class="CetSht_ol">
	<li class="CetSht_li">Lee Jae-myung, leader of Korea's main opposition Democratic Party (DP), said they will try to impeach the President again on December 14, if he doesn't resign before that. Mr Yoon averted an impeachment attempt late on Saturday. The proposed impeachment motion by Opposition parties needed 200 votes in the 300-member parliament to pass. However, a near-total boycott by Mr Yoon's People Power Party (PPP) doomed it to failure.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">However, the leader of Mr Yoon's party said the president would effectively be excluded from his duties before eventually stepping down. The leader of the PPP, Han Dong-hoon, told a press conference, alongside Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, on Sunday that Mr Yoon would not be involved in foreign and other state affairs before his early resignation.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">On Saturday before the vote, 63-year-old Yoon reappeared for the first time in three days and apologised for the "anxiety and inconvenience" caused by his declaration of martial law. But he stopped short of stepping down, saying he would leave it to his party to decide his fate. His party leader said the comments were effectively a promise to leave office early, adding that the ruling party would consult with the prime minister to manage state affairs.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">That proposal, which appeared to win tacit approval from the Yoon-appointed Prime Minister, drew condemnation from opposition lawmakers who said it was another unconstitutional power grab to delegate authority without resignation or impeachment. The main opposition DP called for the immediate suspension of Mr Yoon's presidential duties and for stripping him of authority to control the military. It also called for the arrest of the President and related military officials implicated in the martial law fiasco.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">National Assembly speaker Woo Won-shik also said it was unconstitutional to delegate presidential authority to the prime minister and the ruling party without impeachment. Woo proposed a meeting of rival parties to discuss ways to suspend Yoon's presidential power immediately.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Meanwhile, police arrested Kim Yong-hyun, the former defence minister of South Korea. Mr Kim had resigned after the brief dramatic imposition of martial law in the country earlier this week. The Asian nation's interior minister Lee Sang-min has also resigned. Both they and Mr Yoon are being investigated for alleged insurrection.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Yonhap news agency reported that prosecutors had "booked" President Yoon, a process in South Korea that involves formally naming subjects of investigation. This came after three minority opposition parties filed a complaint with the prosecution against Mr Yoon, ex-Defence Minister Kim Yong-hyun and martial law commander Park An-su, accusing them of insurrection. The crime of leading an insurrection is punishable by death or life imprisonment, with or without prison labour.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Prime Minister Han Duck-soo said on Sunday the cabinet would do its best to "maintain trust with our allies", referring to the United States and Japan. In an effort to reassure the public, multiple military leaders, including the acting defence minister, have stated they would refuse any orders to impose another round of martial law.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Meanwhile, protests continue in South Korea as massive crowds -- police said there were 150,000 people, organisers one million -- gathered outside parliament to pressure lawmakers to oust the president. Many wore elaborate outfits, carrying homemade flags and waving colourful glow sticks and LED candles as K-pop tunes blasted from speakers.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Yoon shocked the nation on Tuesday night when he imposed martial law, giving the military sweeping emergency powers to root out what he called "anti-state forces" and obstructionist political opponents. He rescinded the order six hours later, after parliament defied military and police cordons to vote unanimously against the decree.</li>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Syria's future hinges on uncertainty after the abrupt fall of President Bashar al-Assad's regime. Once thought unassailable, Assad's rule collapsed under the pressure of a rapid offensive led by a group called Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), formerly known as the Al-Nusra Front affiliated with terror group Al-Qaeda, and allied factions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bashar al-Assad came to power in 2000, succeeding his father, Hafez al-Assad, who ruled Syria with an iron grip for nearly three decades. Initially, there were hopes that Bashar would bring reform and openness to Syria. However, these aspirations were dashed as he maintained the repressive structure of his father's regime.</p>

<p><strong>READ </strong>| <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/syria-bashar-al-assad-assad-family-damascus-the-al-assads-syrias-first-familys-rapid-rise-brutal-rule-abrupt-end-7198899#pfrom=home-ndtv_topscroll" target="_blank">Fall Of Assads: How An Alawite Family Ruled Over A Sunni Nation For Decades</a></p>

<p>Assad's legacy will forever be marred by his response to the protests in 2011, which escalated into a brutal civil war. Over half a million people have been killed, six million became refugees, and countless more are internally displaced. With military backing from Russia and Iran, Assad survived against a fragmented opposition, relying on Russian air power and Iranian-backed militias like Hezbollah.</p>

<p>Preoccupied with their own struggles - Russia in Ukraine and Iran facing regional challenges - neither could offer significant support. Within days, the rebels captured key cities like Aleppo, Hama, and Homs, before advancing into Damascus itself.</p>

<h2><strong>A Fragile Transition</strong></h2>

<p>Rebel leader Abu Mohammed al-Golani, known now by his real name, Ahmed al-Sharaa, announced the formation of a transitional authority. Syrian Prime Minister Mohammed al-Jalali has been appointed as the caretaker of state institutions.</p>

<p><strong>READ </strong>| <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/syrian-president-bashar-al-assad-has-left-damascus-as-rebels-advance-towards-capital-news-agency-reuters-7198265#pfrom=home-ndtv_topscroll" target="_blank">"End Of Era Of Tyranny": Bashar Al-Assad Flees Syria As Rebels Move In</a></p>

<p>In a statement, al-Jalali expressed his willingness to cooperate with any leadership chosen by the Syrian people.</p>

<p>Despite these efforts, HTS's history - rooted in al-Qaeda - casts a long shadow over its promises of a diplomatic and nationalist approach. Scepticism abounds regarding its long-term intentions and ability to govern a fractured country.</p>

<p>The end of Assad's rule does not immediately translate to peace for Syrians. HTS's past association with extremist groups raises fears of a harsh, authoritarian rule under the guise of Islamist governance. Millions of displaced Syrians, both within the country and abroad, face an uncertain future as they watch the unfolding events with hope and trepidation.</p>

<h2><strong>The Russian Setback</strong></h2>

<p>The fall of Assad marks a blow to Russian influence in the Middle East. Since its intervention in 2015, Russia has been the regime's most steadfast supporter, maintaining strategic assets such as the Tartous naval facility and the Hmeimim airbase in Latakia. These bases are vital for projecting power across the Mediterranean and into Africa.</p>

<p>However, Russia's military focus is currently consumed by its war in Ukraine. The loss of control in Syria raises questions about Moscow's ability to safeguard its strategic footholds in the region.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Iran Losing The Axis Of Resistance</strong></h2>

<p>For Iran, Assad's downfall disrupts the "<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/israel-hamas-palestine-gaza-explained-axis-of-resistance-and-irans-proxy-network-across-middle-east-4534061" target="_blank">Axis of Resistance</a>" that connects Tehran to Hezbollah in Lebanon through Syria. This network has been crucial for transferring weapons and exerting influence in the region. With Hezbollah weakened from its recent conflict with Israel and Iran's proxies in Yemen and Iraq under pressure, Tehran's war strategy will need a different approach.</p>

<p>Iran's preoccupation with Israel, which it views as an existential threat, further limits its capacity to respond effectively in Syria. Israel's recent targeting of Iranian assets has compounded these challenges, leaving Tehran on the defensive.</p>

<h2><strong>Turkey's Role</strong></h2>

<p>Turkey's role in Assad's fall remains ambiguous. While President Recep Tayyip Erdogan had long advocated for a diplomatic resolution to the Syrian conflict, his calls were consistently rebuffed by Assad. Turkey, home to over three million Syrian refugees, has a vested interest in resolving the conflict to facilitate their return.</p>

<p>Ankara has denied direct involvement in the HTS offensive, but analysts suggest that Turkey's tacit approval or indirect support may have played a role. Erdogan's priorities include securing Turkey's borders and countering Kurdish militias in northern Syria.</p>

<h2><strong>Israel's Strategic Thinking</strong></h2>

<p>For Israel, the collapse of Assad's regime represents both opportunity and risk. The fall of Iran's primary ally in Syria disrupts the supply chain to Hezbollah, but the emergence of HTS as a dominant force introduces new uncertainties.</p>

<p>Israel has reinforced its presence along the Golan Heights, preparing for potential spillovers or attempts by rebels to seize Syrian army stockpiles. The Israeli military is also wary of Iran and Hezbollah exploiting the chaos to acquire advanced weaponry.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>SpaceX postponed once more its attempt at launching a daring orbital expedition featuring an all-civilian crew that is aiming to carry out the first-ever spacewalk by private citizens.</p>

<p>The Polaris Dawn mission, organized by billionaire entrepreneur Jared Isaacman, had been set to lift off from NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida during a four-hour window early Wednesday.</p>

<p>But SpaceX announced late Tuesday it was pushing back the launch plans "due to unfavorable weather forecasted in Dragon's splashdown areas off the coast of Florida," in a message on X.</p>

<p>Isaacman later added on X that, because the spaceship won't rendezvous with the International Space Station and has limited consumables on board, it was particularly constrained by the forecast during the splashdown window.</p>

<p>"As of now, conditions are not favorable tonight or tomorrow, so we'll assess day by day," he said.</p>

<p>The timing of the next launch could be further complicated by the fact the first stage booster of another SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket that had sent a batch of Starlink satellites into orbit tipped over and exploded during a landing attempt on a waiting droneship.</p>

<p>Although landing the booster is a secondary consideration, the reusability of the entire rocket system is core to SpaceX's business model, and the loss snapped a three-year-streak of successful first stage landings.</p>

<p>SpaceX announced it was standing down from launching the next set of Starlink satellites while it reviewed the data.</p>

<p>An earlier attempt to launch Polaris Dawn on Tuesday was scrapped due to a helium leak on a line connecting the tower to the rocket.</p>

<p><strong>High radiation zone</strong></p>

<p>Riding atop a Falcon 9 rocket, the SpaceX Dragon capsule is set to reach a peak altitude of 870 miles (1,400 kilometers) -- higher than any crewed mission in more than half a century, since the Apollo era.</p>

<p>Mission commander Isaacman will guide his four-member team through the mission's centerpiece: the first-ever spacewalk carried out by non-professional astronauts, equipped with sleek, newly developed SpaceX extravehicular activity (EVA) suits.</p>

<p>Rounding out the team are mission pilot Scott Poteet, a retired US Air Force lieutenant colonel; mission specialist Sarah Gillis, a lead space operations engineer at SpaceX; and mission specialist and medical officer Anna Menon, also a lead space operations engineer at SpaceX.</p>

<p>The quartet underwent more than two years of training in preparation for the landmark mission, logging hundreds of hours on simulators as well as skydiving, centrifuge training, scuba diving, and summiting an Ecuadorian volcano.</p>

<p>Polaris Dawn is set to be the first of three missions under the Polaris program, a collaboration between Isaacman, the founder of tech company Shift4 Payments, and SpaceX.</p>

<p>Isaacman declined to reveal his total investment in the project, though reports suggest he paid around $200 million for the SpaceX Inspiration4 mission in September 2021, the first all-civilian orbital mission.</p>

<p>Polaris Dawn will reach its highest altitude on its first day, venturing briefly into the Van Allen radiation belt, a region teeming with high-energy charged particles that can pose health risks to humans over extended periods.</p>

<p>On day three, the crew will don their state-of-the-art EVA spacesuits -- outfitted with heads-up displays, helmet cameras, and advanced joint mobility systems -- and take turns to venture outside their spacecraft in twos.</p>

<p>Each will spend 15 to 20 minutes in space, 435 miles above Earth's surface.</p>

<p>Also on their to-do list are testing laser-based satellite communication between the spacecraft and Starlink, SpaceX's more than 6,000-strong constellation of internet satellites, in a bid to boost space communication speeds, and conducting nearly 40 scientific experiments.</p>

<p>After six days in space, the mission will conclude with the splashdown off the coast of Florida.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Rasheed manipulated over 250 victims around the globe into performing explicit acts on camera.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 29-year-old Australian man has been sentenced to 17 years in prison for one of the worst sextortion cases in the country's history. Muhammad Zain Ul Abideen Rasheed blackmailed hundreds of girls online, many of whom were minors, into performing explicit acts, reported <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp35z4z08qvo" rel="noindex, nofollow"><em>BBC</em></a>.</p>

<p>Rasheed posed as a famous teenager on social media to lure his victims. He would build trust with them before blackmailing them with threats of exposing their private information. Despite his victims' distress and pleas for help, Rasheed continued his harmful actions.</p>

<p>Rasheed manipulated over 250 victims around the globe into performing explicit acts on camera.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Australian Federal Police and the Western Australia Joint Anti-Child Exploitation Team conducted a joint investigation that led to Rasheed's arrest.</p>

<p>"The callous disregard this man had for his victims around the world and their distress, humiliation and fear make it one of the most horrific sextortion cases prosecuted in Australia," said Australian Federal Police Assistant Commissioner David McLean.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When announcing the sentence on Tuesday, Judge Amanda Burrows said Rasheed's offence was of such magnitude there was "no comparable case" in the country, according to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC).</p>

<p>Rasheed pretended to be a 15-year-old American internet star. He would start the conversation with his targets, and later involve them in discussions about sexual fantasies.</p>

<p>Rasheed threatened the victims to send their responses to friends and family unless they performed a series of escalating "degrading" sex acts- which at times included family pets and other children in their home, the BBC reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Western Australia Joint Anti-Child Exploitation Team (WA JACET) first launched an investigation into Rasheed's activities in September 2019.</p>

<p>Several children told him they were suicidal- one event sent images of self-harm. But he continued to blackmail them despite their "obvious distress" and "extreme fear", the judge said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He has been convicted of multiple charges, including sexual assault.&nbsp; He will be eligible to petition for parole in August 2033.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two members of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's campaign staff had a "verbal and physical altercation" with an Arlington National Cemetery official during a visit by Trump this week, NPR reported on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Trump on Monday participated in a wreath-laying ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery honoring the 13 servicemembers killed during the US withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021.</p>

<p>Later in Detroit, Trump blamed Vice Preisdent Kamala Harris, his Democratic rival for the White House, and President Joe Biden for what he termed a "catastrophic" withdrawal.</p>

<p>Citing an unnamed source, NPR reported that when a cemetery official tried to prevent Trump campaign staffers from filming and photographing in an area where servicemembers are buried, the Trump staff "verbally abused and pushed the official aside."</p>

<p>Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung disputed the report. "There was no physical altercation as described and we are prepared to release footage if such defamatory claims are made," Cheung said.</p>

<p>"The fact is that a private photographer was permitted on the premises and for whatever reason an unnamed individual, clearly suffering from a mental health episode, decided to physically block members of President Trump's team during a very solemn ceremony."</p>

<p>Arlington National Cemetery confirmed in a statement that an incident had occurred and that a report was filed.</p>

<p>"Federal law prohibits political campaign or election-related activities within Army National Military Cemeteries, to include photographers, content creators or any other persons attending for purposes, or in direct support of a partisan political candidate's campaign," the cemetery said.</p>

<p>It did not respond to requests for a copy of the report or an explanation of why the Trump campaign was allowed to visit the cemetery as part of his campaign.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The city of Jenin, a Palestinian militant stronghold in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, has been a hotbed of conflict between the Israeli military and Palestinians in recent years.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The city of Jenin, a Palestinian operative stronghold in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, has been a hotbed of conflict between the Israeli military and Palestinians in recent years.</p>

<p>The Israeli military killed at least nine people on Wednesday in a major operation in the West Bank that involved Jenin and other cities, ratcheting up tensions as a war rages in Gaza between Palestinian group Hamas and Israel.</p>

<p>Here's what you need to know about Jenin.</p>

<h3><strong>Refugee camp</strong></h3>

<p>Jenin is a small city in the hilly, far north of the West Bank, near the border with Israel, and contains a teeming, concrete and cinder-block refugee camp by the same name housing some 14,000 people.</p>

<p>They are descendants of Palestinians displaced when Israel was created in 1948, and most are impoverished and unemployed. This has generated die-hard hostility to Israel and support for Palestinian groups.</p>

<p>Jenin has one of the highest rates of unemployment and poverty among 19 refugee camps in the West Bank, according to UNRWA, a UN agency that delivers basic services to Palestinian refugees.</p>

<p>Alienated from mainstream Palestinian leadership and raised in an era of social media, a new generation of Palestinians has formed a clutch of operative groups in the West Bank such as the Jenin Brigade which includes fighters from Hamas, Islamic Jihad, and Fatah's al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades.</p>

<p>Jenin produced many of the suicide bombers who spearheaded the second Palestinian Intifada, or uprising, between 2000 and 2005. To curb it, Israeli armoured forces carried out devastating raids in the city where operatives had an array of light weapons and a growing arsenal of explosive devices.</p>

<p>The Israeli military regularly accuses the groups of basing fighters within densely populated urban areas such as refugee camps that date back to 1948. Many of the operatives live in the Jenin camp, often with their families.</p>

<p>Since March 2022, Jenin and outlying areas in the north of the West Bank have drawn intensified Israeli raids after a spate of Palestinian street attacks.</p>

<p>Operative groups present in Jenin include the Iran-backed Islamic Jihad and Islamist Hamas.</p>

<h3><strong>Fading Palestinian Authority</strong></h3>

<p>Jenin used to be a bastion of 88-year-old Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas' Fatah faction, a rival of Hamas, which started the Oct. 7 war in Gaza with a cross-border raid on Israel that killed 1,200 people, according to Israeli tallies.</p>

<p>But Fatah has lost ground to Hamas and Islamic Jihad. Their growing presence has arisen in part from inaction by the security forces of Abbas' Western-backed Palestinian Authority (PA), which exercises limited self-rule in parts of the West Bank and says Israel has undercut its credibility on the street.</p>

<p>But their strength also feeds on what critics say is the weakness of Abbas, whose formula of statehood negotiations with Israel collapsed in 2014, with no revival on the horizon, and perceived endemic incompetence and corruption within the PA.</p>

<p>Israel says the Jenin refugee camp is a hub for planning and preparing attacks as well as a safe haven for fighters funded by Hamas or Islamic Jihad.</p>

<p>Battleground during the 2000-2005 Uprising</p>

<p>Jenin was the scene of some of the worst violence during the second Intifada, which began after the collapse of U.S.-backed peace talks in 2000 and mushroomed into an armed conflict between Israel and Palestinian groups.</p>

<p>In April 2002, Israel carried out a major armoured assault on the Jenin refugee camp, part of a wider West Bank operation that Israel said aimed to stop operative attacks including a spate of deadly suicide bombings.</p>

<p>A UN report issued in August 2002 said 52 Palestinians had been killed in Israel's Jenin incursion, as many as half of them civilians, while Israel lost 23 soldiers there.</p>

<p>The report, which disputed a claim by then-Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erekat that 500 people had been killed in Jenin, faulted all combatants for putting civilians in harm's way.</p>

<p>The report listed more Israeli than Palestinian abuses, especially Israel's refusal to let humanitarian workers enter the camp. But it also said Palestinian fighters were lodged in civilian homes.</p>

<h3><strong>Renewed Violence</strong></h3>

<p>Jenin has re-emerged as a flashpoint during the current wave of Israeli-Palestinian violence that has convulsed the West Bank for more than two years, with frequent deadly confrontations.</p>

<p>Violence in Jenin persisted in 2024.</p>

<p>In May Israeli forces killed 10 Palestinians and wounded 25 others. A doctor and a teenager were among those killed during a major operation that involved dozens of vehicles.</p>

<p>In June, Israeli forces killed three Palestinians and wounded at least 13 others in a raid on Jenin.</p>

<p>This month, Israel said it killed two senior Hamas operatives in an airstrike on their car in Jenin.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Police in Vietnam have arrested more than a dozen people in connection with a baby smuggling ring that trafficked 16 newborns across several cities and provinces in the country, state media said Wednesday.</p>

<p>Sixteen men and women have been taken into custody for trading the babies aged between three days and three months old, according to the official newspaper of Ho Chi Minh City Police.</p>

<p>The gang targeted women through closed groups on social media, exploiting those who were struggling to provide and care for their children.</p>

<p>They bought each baby at a cost of between $400 and $930, the report said.</p>

<p>The gang then falsified adoption documents and resold them for between $1,400 and $3,000.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Five days since an Indian woman, Vijaya Lakshmi Gali, disappeared in a sinkhole in Malaysia, authorities in Kuala Lumpur are continuing their round-the-clock search and rescue operation in an attempt to find her.</p>

<p>The Indian High Commission has been in touch with Ms Vijay Lakshmi's family and are updating them about the search and rescue operations.</p>

<p>48-year-old Vijaya Lakshmi Gali, who frequently travels to Malaysia and Singapore for business, disappeared after falling into the 8m-deep hole. She was on her way to the temple when the ground suddenly caved in. Her husband and son managed to escape the collapse.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Japan braced Wednesday for its strongest typhoon of the year, with authorities advising tens of thousands of people to evacuate and issuing the highest warning level for wind and storm surges on the main southern island of Kyushu.</p>

<p>"Typhoon Shanshan is expected to approach southern Kyushu with extremely strong force through Thursday and it may make landfall," Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi told reporters.</p>

<p>"It is expected that violent winds, high waves, and storm surge at levels that many people have never experienced before may occur," said Hayashi, the top government spokesman.</p>

<p>The approach of the storm, packing gusts of up to 252 kilometres (157 miles) per hour and already bringing widespread heavy rain, prompted auto giant Toyota to suspend production at all 14 of its factories.</p>

<p>Two people remained unaccounted for on Wednesday after a landslide buried a house with five family members inside in Gamagori, a city in central Aichi prefecture.</p>

<p>Rescuers worked around the clock and on Wednesday afternoon they pulled out a woman in her 70s.</p>

<p>"She wasn't breathing and was unconscious," a Gamagori official told AFP. They were still searching for a man in his 70s and another in his 30s.</p>

<p>For southern Kyushu, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) predicted 1,100 millimetres (43 inches) of precipitation in the 48 hours to Friday morning, around half the annual average for the area comprising Kagoshima and Miyazaki regions.</p>

<p>The JMA also issued its highest "special warning" for violent storms, waves and high tides in parts of the Kagoshima region of Kyushu, with authorities there advising 56,000 people to evacuate.</p>

<p>Video on public broadcaster NHK TV showed roof tiles being blown off houses, broken windows and felled trees.</p>

<p>"Our carport roof was blown away in its entirety. I wasn't at home when it happened, but my kids say they felt the shaking so strong they thought an earthquake happened," a local resident in Miyazaki told NHK.</p>

<p>"I was surprised. It was completely beyond our imagination," she said.</p>

<p>The warnings indicate the "possibility that a major disaster prompted by (the typhoon) is extremely high," Satoshi Sugimoto, chief forecaster of JMA, told a news conference.</p>

<p>Japan Airlines cancelled 172 domestic flights and six international flights scheduled for Wednesday and Thursday, while ANA nixed 219 domestic flights and four international ones on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday.</p>

<p>The cancellations affected around 25,000 people.</p>

<p>Kyushu Railway said it would suspend some Shinkansen bullet train services between Kumamoto and Kagoshima Chuo from Wednesday night and warned of further possible disruption.</p>

<p>Trains between Tokyo and Fukuoka, the most populous city in Kyushu, may also be cancelled depending on weather conditions this week, other operators said.</p>

<p>Shanshan comes in the wake of Typhoon Ampil, which disrupted hundreds of flights and trains this month.</p>

<p>Despite dumping heavy rain, it caused only minor injuries and damage.</p>

<p>Ampil came days after Tropical Storm Maria brought record rains to northern areas.</p>

<p>Typhoons in the region have been forming closer to coastlines, intensifying more rapidly and lasting longer over land due to climate change, according to a study released last month.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Bangladeshi TV journalist was found dead in a lake in the country's capital Dhaka today, according to the local media. The body of the journalist, identified as Sarah Rahanuma, 32, was found floating in Dhaka's Hatirjheel lake.&nbsp;</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bangladesh's caretaker government revoked a ban on the country's main Islamic party and its affiliated groups on Wednesday, saying it has not found evidence of their involvement in "terrorist activities".</p>

<p>Former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's government had banned the Jamaat-e-Islami party under an anti-terrorism law, blaming it for stoking deadly violence during student-led protests that turned into an uprising against Hasina, forcing her to resign and flee to India on Aug. 5.</p>

<p>A gazette notification on Wednesday by the caretaker government that replaced Hasina's administration said there was "no specific evidence of involvement of Jamaat" and its affiliates "in terrorist activities".</p>

<p>The party has denied allegations that it stoked violence and had condemned the ban as "illegal, extrajudicial and unconstitutional."</p>

<p>Jamaat has not been able to contest elections in Bangladesh after a court said in 2013 its registration as a political party conflicted with Bangladesh's secular constitution.</p>

<p>Shishir Monir, a lawyer for the party, said it will file a petition early next week at the Supreme Court to seek restoration of its registration.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Pakistani woman, who mowed down two people with her Toyota Land Cruiser in Karachi, is "mentally weak", her lawyer has said. <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/who-is-natasha-danish-ali-the-pakistani-woman-behind-the-deadly-land-cruiser-crash-6434510">Natasha Danish</a>, after the incident, was caught on camera with an unsettling smile on her face, reportedly taunting the angry mob with the statement, "<em>Tum mere baap ko nahi jantay</em>" (You don't know who my father is).</p>

<p>The accident occurred on August 19, when Natasha attempted to make a turn on Karsaz Road in Karachi, colliding with a motorcycle and a parked car, killing a father-daughter duo and injuring at least four.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The next day, Natasha's lawyer, Amir Mansub, talked to The Times of Karachi reporters about his client's state of mind.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"She doesn't know that she had an accident and drove a car," he stated. "She is mentally weak. In this condition, people don't remember things. She doesn't know that she had an accident; she doesn't know that she drove the car. She is not in the right frame of mind, absolutely not at all."</p>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Asked why the 32-year-old was allowed to drive in her "sensitive condition", the lawyer said her family was unaware she was out for a drive. "Her family did not know that she was driving a car. Otherwise, there were restrictions that she should drive a car and shouldn't go out. But she just left," he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He further revealed she had been struggling with mental health issues for "the past 5 years" and was on medication at the time of the accident. He also mentioned that she was seeking treatment in the Jinnah Hospital.&nbsp;</p>

<p>An FIR was lodged against Natasha Danish at the Bahadurabad police station in Karachi following the fatal incident. It was filed by Imtiaz Arif, whose brother Imran Arif and niece Amna Arif died in the accident. The complaint invokes sections 320, 337-G, 279, and 427 of the Pakistan Penal Code, pertaining to rash and negligent driving, hurt and mischief, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1853753/driver-responsible-for-karachis-karsaz-road-accident-sent-to-jail-on-14-day-judicial-remand ">Dawn</a> reported.</p>

<p>However, despite facing multiple charges, Natasha spent the night at home and not in police custody. On August 20, law enforcement authorities were unable to present her in court, citing her ongoing psychiatric treatment at the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC). The investigation officer requested a 14-day police remand, but the court only granted a one-day remand, as reported by Dawn.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump has faced a jolt from within the Republican party. More than 200 Republicans who previously worked for former US President George W Bush have written an open letter endorsing Kamala Harris for the top post instead of their own party candidate Donald Trump.</p>

<p>This comes weeks ahead of the US Presidential election scheduled in early November.</p>

<p>According to Fox News, a group of Republican officials, including several former aides to George HW Bush, has endorsed Kamala Harris, a Democrat and current Vice President, urging "moderate Republicans and conservative independents" to support her.</p>

<p>However, this is not the first time this has happened. In the previous US election, held in 2020, the same group had opposed Donald Trump.</p>

<p>"Four years ago, President George W Bush, the late Sen John McCain, and then-Gov Mitt Romney alumni came together to warn fellow Republicans that re-electing President Trump would be a disaster for our nation. In those declarations we stated the plain truth, each predicting that another four years of a Trump presidency would irreparably damage our beloved democracy," the letter said, which was published on Monday by US-based news organisation USA Today.</p>

<p>"We reunite today, joined by new George HW Bush alumni, to reinforce our 2020 statements and, for the first time, jointly declare that we're voting for Vice President Kamala Harris and Gov Tim Walz this November," the letter added.</p>

<p>While acknowledging significant policy disagreements with Kamala Harris, the Republican officials emphasised that the alternative is untenable. "Of course, we have plenty of honest, ideological disagreements with Vice President Harris and Gov. Walz. That's to be expected. The alternative, however, is simply untenable," the letter said.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Florida man, who was convicted of killing two women earlier this year, has been sentenced to death. Wade Wilson, known as the "Deadpool Killer", strangled and killed the women in 2019. The 30-year-old showed no emotion as Lee Circuit Judge Nicholas Thompson delivered the capital punishment.</p>

<p>Wilson, who shares&nbsp;his name with the Marvel antihero, was convicted in June for the deaths of Kristine Melton, 35, and Diane Ruiz, 43, reported the <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/08/27/us-news/deadpool-killer-wade-wilson-who-slaughtered-2-women-for-the-sake-of-killing-sentenced-to-death/ ">NY Post</a>.</p>

<p>On the night of the murders, Wilson first attacked Ms Melton in her home after a drug-induced sexual encounter. He strangled her, stole her car, and used her phone to call his girlfriend, Melissa Montanez, whom he later assaulted when she refused to get into the car.</p>

<p>Wilson then encountered Ms Ruiz in Cape Coral, who was asking for directions. He invited her into his vehicle, strangled her and dumped her body. He then ran over Ms Ruiz repeatedly with his car "until she looked like spaghetti," as described during the trial.</p>

<p>Judge Thompson described the murders as "heinous, atrocious, and cruel," as per the NY Post, noting the second killing was "cold, calculated, and premeditated."</p>

<p>Assistant State Attorney Andreas Gardiner slammed Wilson's actions as being driven purely by a desire to kill, calling strangulation "the epitome of life slipping through someone's hands.</p>

<p>Despite the severity of his crimes, Wade Wilson received thousands of fan mail, love letters and X-rated photos from admirers during his time in jail. Some even wrote to the judge, asking for leniency and claiming that Wilson's behaviour changed when he was on medication. His attorneys argued that he suffered from brain damage and abandonment issues, stemming from his drug addiction and his being adopted as a child.</p>

<p>Wilson's adoptive parents also pleaded for mercy, stating they believed "the human is still in there" and asking the court not to impose the death penalty. In addition to his murder convictions, Wilson was found guilty of several other charges, including grand theft, burglary, battery, and petit theft.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A person in the northeastern US state of New Hampshire has died after contracting the very rare mosquito-borne eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) virus, health authorities have announced.</p>

<p>The patient, identified only as an adult from the town of Hampstead, was hospitalised with severe central nervous system disease and later succumbed to the illness, the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) said in a statement.</p>

<p>"The last reported human EEEV infection in New Hampshire was in 2014, when DHHS identified three human infections, including two fatalities," the department said.</p>

<p>The new infection and death comes amid rising concerns from state officials across New England about the increasing risk of EEE, a threat believed to be exacerbated by climate change.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, Massachusetts announced the year's first human case of EEE in the state - a man in his 80s - and officials have asked the public to observe voluntary outdoor curfews, closed public parks, and initiated aerial and ground spraying to control the mosquito population.</p>

<p>According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, symptoms of eastern equine encephalitis include fever, headache, vomiting, diarrhea, seizures, behavioral changes and drowsiness.</p>

<p>It can also cause severe neurological disease, such as inflammation of the brain and membranes around the spinal cord, known as encephalitis and meningitis.</p>

<p>Approximately 30 per cent of those infected die, and many survivors suffer ongoing physical or mental impacts. Individuals under 15 and over 50 are considered at higher risk.</p>

<p>There are currently no vaccines or treatments available.</p>

<p>Health officials advise using insect repellent, wearing protective clothing outdoors and eliminating standing water around homes to reduce mosquito breeding sites.</p>

<p>A 2023 report by Climate Central highlighted that the number of "mosquito days" - warm, humid conditions ideal for mosquito activity - has increased across much of the U.S. over the past four decades due to human-caused climate change.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[The use of "hot mics" has been a topic of debate in previous presidential debates, with some arguing for more authentic and spontaneous discussion.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In just under two weeks, Republican candidate Donald Trump and his Democratic rival Kamala Harris will participate in the first Presidential debate. Ahead of the September 10 face-off, the two campaigns are already at loggerheads over the issue of "hot mics".&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Harris Campaign demands an open mic</strong></p>

<p>The Harris campaign is pushing for an open microphone policy, meaning both candidates will have their mics on throughout the debate. This approach, they argue, ensures transparency and spontaneous interactions, giving the audience a complete picture of each candidate's responses and reactions in real time.</p>

<p>According to Brian Fallon, spokesperson for US Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee is fully prepared to handle Donald Trump's tactics that often entail interruptions and offhand remarks. However, the Harris campaign insists the microphones remain live for the entire debate, ensuring neither "hides behind the mic" or avoids direct responses.</p>

<p><strong>Trump wants mics muted</strong></p>

<p>The Trump campaign, however, is advocating for the same rules as previous debates held in June. For the CNN debate, microphones were muted when it was the other candidate's turn to speak. The Trump team argues that this rule prevents interruptions and maintains order during the debate, allowing each candidate to present their points without disruption.</p>

<p>US President Joe Biden, before stepping down as the Democratic party nominee, had agreed with Donald Trump's campaign on the controversial microphone policy.&nbsp;</p>

<p></p>

<p>The differences over debate rules escalated when Trump implied that the ABC network, which is hosting the September 10 debate, was biased. In a <a href="https://x.com/TrumpDailyPosts/status/1827891929256018092 ">social media post</a>, Trump indicated he had reached an agreement for the microphones to be closed, similar to the rules from the previous CNN debate.</p>

<p>The Trump campaign proposed an additional debate on September 4 on Fox News, which the Harris team rejected.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The use of "hot mics" has been a topic of debate in previous presidential debates, with some arguing for more authentic and spontaneous discussion, while others saying it only leads to candidates speaking over each other and avoiding direct answers.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A person in the northeastern US state of New Hampshire has died after contracting the rare mosquito-borne eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) virus, health authorities announced Tuesday.</p>

<p>The patient, identified only as an adult from the town of Hampstead, was hospitalized with severe central nervous system disease and later succumbed to the illness, the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) said in a statement.</p>

<p>"The last reported human EEEV infection in New Hampshire was in 2014, when DHHS identified three human infections, including two fatalities," the department said.</p>

<p>The new infection and death come amid rising concerns from state officials across New England about the increasing risk of EEE, a threat believed to be exacerbated by climate change.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, Massachusetts announced the year's first human case of EEE in the state -- a man in his 80s -- and officials have asked the public to observe voluntary outdoor curfews, closed public parks, and initiated aerial and ground spraying to control the mosquito population.</p>

<p>According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, symptoms of eastern equine encephalitis include fever, headache, vomiting, diarrhoea, seizures, behavioural changes and drowsiness.</p>

<p>It can also cause severe neurological diseases, such as inflammation of the brain and membranes around the spinal cord, known as encephalitis and meningitis.</p>

<p>Approximately 30 per cent of those infected die, and many survivors suffer ongoing physical or mental impacts. Individuals under 15 and over 50 are considered at higher risk.</p>

<p>There are currently no vaccines or treatments available.</p>

<p>Health officials advise using insect repellent, wearing protective clothing outdoors and eliminating standing water around homes to reduce mosquito breeding sites.</p>

<p>A 2023 report by Climate Central highlighted that the number of "<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/offbeat/world-mosquito-day-date-theme-history-and-significance-6374914" target="_blank">mosquito days</a>"-warm, humid conditions ideal for mosquito activity increased across much of the US over the past four decades due to human-caused climate change.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Voters in Maricopa County, the largest in the US swing state of Arizona, will play a key role in deciding whether Kamala Harris or Donald Trump wins the White House in November.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Voters in Maricopa County, the largest in the US swing state of Arizona, will play a key role in deciding whether Kamala Harris or Donald Trump wins the White House in November.</p>

<p><strong>Here are five key facts about the county:</strong></p>

<p><strong>America's hottest big city</strong></p>

<p>Maricopa County is home to Phoenix, Arizona's state capital, where the average high temperature exceeds 100 degrees Fahrenheit (37.7 Celsius) for four months of the year.</p>

<p>The sun-drenched metropolis was named in the late 19th century after being founded on the ruins of an ancient native civilization. The small settlement, located in the northern Sonoran Desert, was worth just $550 after the US Civil War.</p>

<p>Irrigation helped Phoenix grow from a sleepy frontier town dotted with saguaro cacti into a center for citrus, cattle and cotton. Its hot, arid climate later made it an attraction for tuberculosis patients.</p>

<p>After World War II, immigrants, retirees and young families seeking warm weather and low costs flocked to the area, dramatically increasing the population thanks in part to the advent of air conditioning.</p>

<p>Phoenix is now the nation's fifth-largest by population, surpassing Philadelphia. More than 1.6 million Americans live in the financial services and manufacturing hub, according to the latest US Census.</p>

<p><strong>Historically Republican</strong></p>

<p>The county -- home to about 4.5 million people, or 62 percent of Arizona's population -- is the second-largest voting jurisdiction in the country, and was until recently a reliable Republican stronghold.</p>

<p>"The real significant election, I think, was in 2016 when Trump took the county just by three percentage points. Four years earlier, it was taken by Mitt Romney by 11 points," said David Berman, professor emeritus of political science at Arizona State University.</p>

<p>President Joe Biden beat Trump in Maricopa County by more than 45,000 votes in 2020, helping him break a nearly eight-decade winning streak for Republican presidential candidates in Arizona.</p>

<p>Berman said Trump's right-wing agenda has alienated some Arizonans who prefer more centrist Republicans, such as late US senator John McCain.</p>

<p><strong>Hispanic population growing</strong></p>

<p>The Hispanic population in Maricopa County has grown to account for nearly a third of all residents, according to the latest census.</p>

<p>That change is part of a larger trend spurred in part by rising immigration. Between 2010 and 2020, Arizona's Hispanic residents increased by 16 percent -- faster than the state's overall population growth.</p>

<p>"There has been a concentrated effort to bring out the Hispanic vote as well as the Native American vote," Berman said of the groups, which tend to vote Democratic.</p>

<p>He added that there have also been "some gains for Democrats" as people seeking cheaper housing and better job opportunities continue to move to Arizona from more traditionally liberal states such as California.</p>

<p><strong>Increasingly independent</strong></p>

<p>Despite Arizona's Republican voting history and recent Democratic inroads, more than a third of Maricopa County residents are not affiliated with either party.</p>

<p>Roughly 34 percent of active voters are registered as "other," according to the county's most recent data -- rivaling Republicans at 35 percent and surpassing Democrats at 28 percent.</p>

<p>That proportion has grown steadily over the past few years, making the county's election results more unpredictable.</p>

<p>"Maricopa County still has quite a bit of red in it, and these swing voters will generally opt for more traditional Republicans," rather than Trump's hard-right brand, said Paul Bentz, senior vice president at Phoenix-based public affairs firm Highground.</p>

<p>"We are not a purple state," he said, referring to an area evenly mixed between Republican red and Democratic blue.</p>

<p>"We are a red state with purple spots."</p>

<p><strong>Early voting dominates</strong></p>

<p>About 80 percent of the county's voters cast early ballots in 2020 and 2022, mirroring a statewide trend that predates the coronavirus pandemic.</p>

<p>"We've been doing it for over three decades. Republicans are really the ones that brought early voting to the state of Arizona," Bentz said.</p>

<p>In 1991, the state legislature allowed voters to request an absentee ballot for any reason, making the practice widely available. More than a decade later, Arizona created a program that automatically sends voters a ballot for each upcoming election.</p>

<p>The growth of mail ballots since the pandemic has made vote verification and counting a days-long process. Most US news networks took more than a week to call the state for Biden in 2020.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[A 30-year-old Boeing instructor and part-time pizza worker was found raped and strangled in her Kent, Washington condo in February 1980.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A decades-old cold case murder has finally been cracked, thanks to a discarded cigarette butt, leading to the arrest of 65-year-old Kenneth Kundert in connection with the brutal killing of Dorothy Silzel. According to <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/08/27/us-news/kenneth-kundert-arrested-in-cold-case-murder-of-boeing-instructor-dorothy-silzel/" rel="nofollow, noindex">New York Post,</a></em>&nbsp;the 30-year-old Boeing instructor and part-time pizza worker was found raped and strangled in her Kent, Washington condo in February 1980. Her body was discovered during a welfare check on February 26, three days after she was last seen alive on February 23. Authorities have now linked Kundert to the crime scene through DNA evidence from the cigarette butt, bringing closure to a case that had gone unsolved for 44 years.</p>

<p>According to the charging documents, Ms Silzel's body was found with signs of a violent struggle, having been brutally beaten, strangled, and sexually assaulted. She was left partially naked in her home.&nbsp;At the time of the murder, investigators collected sperm samples from the crime scene using swabs, but the DNA technology available in 1980 was not advanced enough to identify the perpetrator.</p>

<p>The samples were preserved, awaiting future breakthroughs in forensic science.</p>

<p>The case remained dormant for over 40 years until March 2022, when a forensic genealogist uploaded the DNA profile to two databases, reigniting the investigation. The search yielded 11 potential suspects, all first cousins, according to court documents. Kent authorities narrowed their focus to Kenneth Kundert in September and reached out to the Van Buren County Sheriff's Office in Arkansas, seeking his DNA.</p>

<p>Coincidentally, Kundert was already under investigation for a separate assault case. During an interview with the sheriff's office, Kundert exhibited a peculiar behaviour - he carefully collected every cigarette butt he smoked and stored them in his pocket.</p>

<p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0">While smoking in a Walmart parking lot earlier this year, he carelessly discarded a cigarette butt into a receptacle. Alert detectives retrieved the butt from the bin and sent it to a lab for analysis. The results revealed showed that the DNA from the cigarette butt was identical to the DNA evidence collected from the 1980 crime scene, finally linking Kundert to the murder of Dorothy Silzel.</p>

<p>Although there was no apparent direct connection between them, investigators discovered that a relative of Kundert resided in an apartment near Silzel's home at the time of the murder. Furthermore, Kundert, then 20 years old, had worked in Washington state around 1987, approximately seven years after the crime.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He was arrested on August 20 by deputies from the Van Buren County Sheriff's Office and is currently being held on a bail of $3 million.&nbsp;He is expected to be extradited to Washington at a later date.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Astronauts Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore will return to Earth in February 2025, six months later than initially planned, NASA has revealed. The duo will depart from the International Space Station (ISS) aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft, instead of the originally intended Boeing Starliner. However, their extended stay has raised concerns about their survival, particularly regarding food and oxygen supply.</p>

<p>NASA has assured that there is no immediate danger to the astronauts and the ISS has sufficient provisions to support the crew for the additional time.</p>

<p>"The space station is well-stocked with everything the crew needs, including food, water, clothing and oxygen," NASA stated. The agency stressed that regular resupply missions will ensure the astronauts' needs are met, citing regular arrivals of cargo spacecraft carrying food, fuel and supplies.</p>

<p>The space station revealed that two spacecraft - one carrying "8,200 pounds of food, fuel, supplies" and another carrying "three tons of cargo" - arrived at the ISS recently.</p>

<p>Living in space for an extended period requires unique arrangements. On the ISS, astronauts can sleep anywhere - floor, ceiling or walls - thanks to zero gravity. They use sleeping stations, similar to phone booths, with sleeping bags and pillows attached to the floor, wall, or ceiling. Astronauts can also make video calls, audio calls or send emails through NASA.</p>

<p>The ISS has a gym, called the Advanced Resistive Exercise Device (ARED), where astronauts can work out using vacuum cylinders to simulate weights. They can perform exercises like squats, deadlifts and bench presses to maintain muscle mass and bone density until they return to Earth.</p>

<p>Aboard the ISS, Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore also have access to the Vegetable Production System (Veggie garden) which allows them to grow fresh produce and even flowers in space. During their extended stay, the duo has been experimenting with various techniques to improve crop growth in space.</p>

<p>Williams and Wilmore are scheduled to return to Earth in late February aboard a SpaceX spacecraft. Meanwhile, their original ride, the Boeing Starliner, will undock in early September and attempt an uncrewed return journey.</p>

<p>NASA Administrator Bill Nelson talked about the agency's commitment to safety, explaining the decision to keep the astronauts on the ISS and return the Starliner uncrewed, "Spaceflight is risky, even at its safest and most routine. A test flight, by nature, is neither safe nor routine."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The threat of a "megaquake", a series of typhoons, and a week-long national holiday have some Japanese scrambling to buy rice -- the nation's cherished staple food -- with the government warning Tuesday against panic buying.</p>

<p>"We could only procure half the usual amount of rice this summer and bags of rice get quickly sold out," a clerk at a branch of the popular Fresco supermarket chain told AFP in the Japanese capital.</p>

<p>Rice shelves in some stores emptied or stocks were rationed after a government warning this month -- since lifted -- of a possible "megaquake", as well as several typhoons and the annual Obon holiday.</p>

<p>Other factors include lower harvests caused by hot weather and water shortages, as well as increased demand related to record numbers of foreign tourists.</p>

<p>At one food store in Tokyo, a sign seen by AFP read: "In order for many customers to be able to buy, we ask you to purchase one (bag of rice) a day per family."</p>

<h3><strong>'No prospects'</strong></h3>

<p>A worker at another store in Tokyo said: "We can't purchase any rice at all, and there's no prospect of buying anytime soon".</p>

<p>The Fresco worker told AFP that daily stocks ran out by midday.</p>

<p>"Customers queue up before the store opens but piles of bags, each of which contains 10 kilograms (22 pounds), are always sold out during the morning," he said.</p>

<p>Farm minister Tetsushi Sakamoto appealed for calm Tuesday.</p>

<p>"Please be cool-headed in your purchase activity by buying only the amount of rice you need," Sakamoto said, stressing "the supply shortage situation will be gradually resolved."</p>

<p>Rice is deeply ingrained in Japanese culture and its harvesting has shaped the nation's landscape -- even being used as a currency in the 7th century.</p>

<p>With an annual consumption of seven million tons per year, it is by far the most consumed food staple in the country.</p>

<p>Demand has been falling for some time, however, because of a declining population and changing eating habits by many Japanese as they opt for alternatives.</p>

<p>The nation's stockpile in June was the lowest since 1999 when comparable data was first collected, but officials believe the inventory is sufficient.</p>

<p>A new harvesting season has started with 40 percent of the crop available by the end of September, a farm ministry official told AFP.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

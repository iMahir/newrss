       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Canadian writer <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/5-classic-short-stories-of-canadian-noble-laureate-alice-munro-who-died-at-92-5663690">Alice Munro's daughter</a> said Sunday that her stepfather sexually abused her as a child and that her mother was told but stayed with him, in a damning account published after the Nobel laureate's death.</p>

<p>Andrea Robin Skinner wrote in the Toronto Star that she was nine when, in 1976, "one night, while she (Munro) was away, her husband, my stepfather, Gerald Fremlin, climbed into the bed where I was sleeping and sexually assaulted me."</p>

<p>She wrote that when she was alone with Fremlin -- who died in 2013 -- he "exposed himself during car rides, told me about the little girls in the neighborhood he liked, and described my mother's sexual needs."</p>

<p>Skinner said that, when she was 25, she shared everything that had happened with Munro -- but acclaimed author decided to stay with Fremlin, whom she wed in the 1970s after her first marriage ended.</p>

<p>"She reacted exactly as I had feared she would, as if she had learned of an infidelity," Skinner wrote of Munro.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We all went back to acting as if nothing had happened. It was what we did," she added.</p>

<p>At 38, Skinner said she took her allegations to the police after Munro complimented her husband in a New York Times interview. Fremlin pleaded guilty in 2005 to indecent assault.</p>

<p>"What I wanted was some record of the truth, some public proof that I hadn't deserved what had happened to me," Skinner wrote.</p>

<p>"I also wanted this story, my story, to become part of the stories people tell about my mother," she added.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Emmanuel Macron's centrist forces performed more strongly than expected in the legislative elections, projected to come in second behind the resurgent left, with the far right that won the first round on June 30 in only third place.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President Emmanuel Macron has avoided his nightmare scenario of the far right coming to power in France but still faces an unprecedented challenge steering his country and the remainder of his presidency through an uncertain future.</p>

<p>Macron's centrist forces performed more strongly than expected in the legislative elections, projected to come in second behind the resurgent left, with the far right that won the first round on June 30 in only third place.</p>

<p>Yet as he prepares to fly to the United States for a NATO summit in Washington, he now faces a number of headaches including a left that now believes it has a mandate to govern, his own unpopularity, and open dissent among some of his most influential allies.</p>

<p>There is still palpable anger among Macron's allies over his decision to call snap legislative elections three years ahead of time after his party was trounced in EU Parliament elections last month.</p>

<p>The president argued that a "clarification" was needed in French politics.</p>

<p>"The decision to dissolve the National Assembly, which was supposed to be a moment of clarification, has instead led to uncertainty," his former Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said Sunday in an unusually sharp barb.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Gabriel Attal, who said he would offer his resignation Monday but was also prepared to stay on, said in an extraordinary show of dissent after the election that he "did not choose this dissolution".</p>

<h3><strong>'The question now'</strong></h3>

<p>The government's strategy of employing a so-called Republican Front for the centre and left to team up to block the far right appears to have worked.</p>

<p>But the election will mark a turning point in Macron's presidency with three years of his term still to run until 2027, with the very mixed new parliament inevitably becoming a far more important actor.</p>

<p>Macron appeared in no hurry on this occasion to make a rapid and theatrical decision, with an aide briefing media that the president preferred to analyse the full results before jumping to conclusions.</p>

<p>The president is confident "and is not going for a small majority", the aide said. "The question now is who is going to govern and have a majority."</p>

<p>Philippe raised the prospect of a broad coalition that would take in parties from right to left via the centre, but exclude the far-right National Rally (RN) and the hard-left France Unbowed (LFI).</p>

<p>So far the leftist New Popular Front (NFP) has not fractured even if the LFI's firebrand figurehead Jean-Luc Melenchon is a constant source of tension.</p>

<p>Foreign Minister Stephane Sejourne, who leads Macron's party, ruled out that Melenchon "and a certain number of his allies" would govern France.</p>

<p>But Laurent Wauquiez, a senior figure among traditional right-wing lawmakers, who won his seat, appeared to rule out entering into any coalition with Macron.</p>

<h3><strong>'Tide is rising'</strong></h3>

<p>Macron's own popularity has hit such a low that he stayed totally out of the final week of the election campaign, not making a single comment in public as the vastly more popular Attal took the lead.</p>

<p>After voting Sunday he mingled with well-wishers in Le Touquet, but did not repeat his walk through the fashionable Channel resort in a bomber jacket and baseball cap as he did in the June 30 first round, seen as arrogant by some supporters.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Political manoeuvring will intensify beneath him. Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin, who won his seat, has made it clear he plans to be a leading voice in the new parliament, possibly in alliance with the faction of Philippe.</p>

<p>And while the far right was defeated in these elections, its three-time presidential candidate Marine Le Pen said she believed this would have no impact on her ambition to win the Elysee Palace in 2027.</p>

<p>"The tide is rising. It did not rise high enough this time, but it continues to rise and, consequently, our victory has only been delayed," Le Pen said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lebanon's Hezbollah movement said on Sunday it launched its "largest" air operation, sending explosive drones at a mountaintop Israeli military intelligence base in the annexed Golan Heights.</p>

<p>It is the latest incident among escalating cross-border exchanges of fire that have triggered global alarm.</p>

<p>Hezbollah, an Iran-backed Hamas ally, has traded almost daily fire with Israeli forces since the Palestinian group's October 7 attack on Israel triggered war in the Gaza Strip.</p>

<p>Announcing "the largest operation" carried out by its aerial forces, Hezbollah said in a statement that its fighters sent "multiple, successive squadrons of drones to target the reconnaissance centre" on Mount Hermon.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said an explosive drone "fell in an open area in the Mount Hermon area" but there were "no injuries".</p>

<p>Attacks as well as rhetoric have escalated in recent weeks, spurring fears of an all-out conflict between Israel and Hezbollah which last went to war in 2006.</p>

<p>The Lebanese movement said the drone attack was part of its "response" to the killing of an operative in a strike Saturday deep into east Lebanon around 100 kilometres (60 miles) from the border.</p>

<p>The Mount Hermon attack targeted intelligence systems, "destroying them and starting a major fire", Hezbollah said.</p>

<p>Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant visited troops on Mount Hermon earlier on Sunday, his office said.</p>

<p>In two additional statements, the military said its air defences "successfully intercepted" several "aerial targets" that crossed from Lebanon after sirens sounded in the Golan Heights area.</p>

<p>Israel seized the Golan Heights from Syria in 1967 and later annexed it in a move largely unrecognised by the international community.</p>

<p>The Israeli strike on Saturday killed "a key operative in Hezbollah's Aerial Defence Unit", the military has said.</p>

<p>Throughout Sunday, Hezbollah announced four more attacks on Israeli military sites across the border with barrages of rockets as well as some guided missiles. Israeli authorities reported four wounded.</p>

<p>Gallant, in a video from Mount Hermon, said that "even if there is a ceasefire" in Gaza, "we will continue fighting and doing everything necessary to bring about the desired result" in the campaign against Hezbollah.</p>

<p>The cross-border violence has killed at least 497 people in Lebanon, mostly fighters but also including 95 civilians, according to an AFP tally.</p>

<p>On the Israeli side, at least 16 soldiers and 11 civilians have been killed, according to the authorities.</p>

<p>Tens of thousands of residents have been displaced from the border areas in both southern Lebanon and northern Israel.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>All ten elderly residents of a Uruguayan nursing home died Sunday after an early-morning fire from which the lone caretaker was the only person to escape, authorities said.</p>

<p>Eight women and two men died from the blaze at the six-roomed facility in the city of Treinta y Tres in the South American country's east, according to an official statement.</p>

<p>Firefighters found the main entrance shuttered on their arrival, it added. Once inside, they found a fire in the living room with smoke having spread throughout the facility.</p>

<p>A 20-year-old caretaker had managed to get out safely through a garage, said the statement.</p>

<p>Seven of the residents died on the scene from smoke inhalation, while three others were rushed to hospital in a critical condition, but did not survive.</p>

<p>The incident came just ten days after a fire at another nursing home for the elderly and people with psychiatric disorders in the city of Melo, also in Uruguay's east.</p>

<p>In that case, a 77-year-old man and 72-year-old woman died in hospital after they were evacuated with 40 other residents.</p>

<p>Sixteen percent of Uruguay's 3.4 million inhabitants is over the age of 65, a proportion that is growing.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The UK's new defence minister pledged on Sunday to deliver more artillery guns, ammunition and missiles to Ukraine, stressing London's ongoing support for Kyiv during a visit to the southern city of Odesa.</p>

<p>John Healey, appointed defence minister Friday by new British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, was visiting the port city, a frequent target of Russian missile and drone strikes, on his first international trip.</p>

<p>"There may have been a change in government, but the UK is united for Ukraine," Healey said, according to a statement published by Britain's defence ministry.</p>

<p>Healey pledged a new package of assistance including artillery guns, 250,000 rounds of ammunition, de-mining vehicles, small military boats, missiles and other equipment, the defence ministry said.</p>

<p>In Odesa, he met Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Defence Minister Rustem Umerov.</p>

<p>London has been one of Kyiv's staunchest backers since Russia invaded in February 2022.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Zelensky posted footage showing Healey laying flowers at a memorial to mark Ukraine's Navy Day.</p>

<p>He said he had briefed Healey and Dutch Defence Minister Ruben Brekelmans -- who also took up the post last week -- on the situation on the battlefield.</p>

<p>In the capital Kyiv over the weekend, the Netherlands' Foreign Minister Caspar Veldkamp pledged to begin sending F-16 fighter planes to Ukraine "without delay".</p>

<p>Britain's Healey also said a major UK aid package announced in April would be delivered "in full to Ukraine within the next 100 days".</p>

<p>Kyiv has regularly complained about the late arrival of Western military supplies, which are vital to its outmanned and outgunned forces fighting off the Russian invasion.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An alliance of French left-wing parties was on course Sunday to beat the far right and President Emmanuel Macron's coalition in a stunning outcome to parliamentary elections that plunges France into new political uncertainty.</p>

<p>No one group won an absolute majority in the second round of the poll, which leaves France without any clear path to forming a new government three weeks before the Paris Olympics.</p>

<p>But after winning the June 30 first round by a clear margin, the results were a major disappointment for the far-right National Rally (RN) of Marine Le Pen, even if her forces are set to boast about their biggest ever contingent in parliament.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Macron's centrist alliance will have dozens fewer members of parliament, but held up better than expected.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Gabriel Attal said he would offer Macron his resignation on Monday but was ready to serve "as long as duty demands", notably in light of the imminent Games.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The New Popular Front (NFP) -- formed last month after Macron called snap elections -- brought together the previously deeply divided Socialists, Greens, Communists and the hard-left France Unbowed (LFI) together in one camp.</p>

<p>But projections by major polling agencies showed the NFP set to be the largest bloc in the new National Assembly with 177 to 198 seats, Macron's alliance on 152 to 169 seats and the RN on 135 to 145 seats.</p>

<p>This means no group is even close to the 289 seats needed for an absolute majority and it remains unclear how a new government can be formed.</p>

<p>Macron, who has yet to speak in public about the projections, is calling for "prudence and analysis of the results", said an aide, asking not to be named.</p>

<h3><strong>'Historic occasion'</strong></h3>

<p>Firebrand leftist Jean-Luc Melenchon, leader of LFI and the controversial figurehead of the NFP coalition, demanded that the left be allowed to form a government.</p>

<p>"Its constituent parts, the united left, have shown themselves equal to the historic occasion and in their own way have foiled the trap set for the country," he said.</p>

<p>Only one week ago, some polls had indicated the RN could win an absolute majority with Le Pen's 28-year-old lieutenant Jordan Bardella becoming prime minister.</p>

<p>Instead, he expressed fury.</p>

<p>Bardella dubbed the local electoral pacts that saw the left and centrists avoid splitting the anti-RN vote as an "alliance of dishonour".</p>

<p>He said it had thrown "France into the arms of Jean-Luc Melenchon's extreme left".</p>

<p>Le Pen, who wants to launch a fourth bid for the presidency in 2027, declared: "The tide is rising. It did not rise high enough this time, but it continues to rise and, consequently, our victory has only been delayed."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Last week saw more than 200 tactical-voting pacts between centre and left-wing candidates in seats to attempt to prevent the RN winning an absolute majority.</p>

<p>This has been hailed as a return of the anti-far right "Republican Front" first summoned when Le Pen's father Jean-Marie faced Jacques Chirac in the run-off of 2002 presidential elections.</p>

<p>There had been fears a strong RN showing would weaken France's resolve in backing Ukraine in its fight against the Russian invasion.</p>

<p>Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said the result would lead to "disappointment" in Russia and "relief" in Ukraine. Spanish premier Pedro Sanchez welcomed France's "rejection of the far right".</p>

<h3><strong>Tense campaign</strong></h3>

<p>The election campaign, the shortest in French history, was marked by a febrile national mood, threats and violence -- including racist abuse -- against dozens of candidates and canvassers.</p>

<p>Some 30,000 police were deployed to keep order, and many voters expressed fears that rioting could erupt in some cities after the results were announced.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Turnout was nevertheless high, with left-wing and centrist candidates urging supporters to defend democratic values and the rule of law -- while the far right scented a chance to upend the established order.</p>

<p>In key individual battles, Le Pen's sister Marie-Caroline narrowly lost out on being a lawmaker, but former president Francois Hollande will return to frontline politics as a Socialist member of parliament.</p>

<p>The question for France now is if this alliance of last resort can support a stable government, dogged by a huge RN bloc in parliament led by Le Pen herself as she prepares a 2027 presidential bid.</p>

<p>"The decision to dissolve the National Assembly, which was supposed to be a moment of clarification, has instead led to uncertainty," said former prime minister and Macron ally Edouard Philippe.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Any Gaza ceasefire deal must allow Israel to resume fighting until its objectives are met, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday, as talks over a U.S. plan aimed at ending the nine-month-old war were expected to restart.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Any Gaza ceasefire deal must allow Israel to resume fighting until its objectives are met, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday, as talks over a U.S. plan aimed at ending the nine-month-old war were expected to restart.</p>

<p>Five days after Hamas accepted a key part of the plan, two officials from the Palestinian militant group said the group was awaiting Israel's response to its latest proposal.</p>

<p>Netanyahu was scheduled to hold consultations late on Sunday on the next steps in negotiating the three-phase plan that was presented in May by U.S. President Joe Biden and is being mediated by Qatar and Egypt.</p>

<p>It aims to end the war and free around 120 Israeli hostages being held in Gaza.</p>

<p>Hamas has dropped a key demand that Israel first commit to a permanent ceasefire before it would sign an agreement. Instead, it said it would allow negotiations to achieve that throughout the six-week first phase, a Hamas source told Reuters on Saturday on condition of anonymity.</p>

<p>But Netanyahu said he insisted the deal must not prevent Israel from resuming fighting until its war objectives are met. Those goals were defined at the start of the war as dismantling Hamas' military and governing capabilities, as well as returning the hostages.</p>

<p>"The plan that has been agreed to by Israel and which has been welcomed by President Biden will allow Israel to return hostages without infringing on the other objectives of the war," Netanyahu said.</p>

<p>The deal, he said, must also prohibit weapons smuggling to Hamas via the Gaza-Egypt border and should not allow for thousands of armed militants to return to northern Gaza.</p>

<p>U.S. Central Intelligence Agency Director William Burns is to meet with the Qatari prime minister and the Israeli and Egyptian intelligence chiefs on Wednesday in Doha, said a source familiar with the issue who asked not to be further identified.</p>

<p>Burns is also expected to visit Cairo this week, along with an Israeli delegation, Egypt's Al Qahera News TV reported on Sunday, citing a high-ranking source.</p>

<p>A Palestinian official close to the talks said the proposal could lead to a framework agreement if embraced by Israel, and would end the war.</p>

<p>"We have left our response with the mediators and are waiting to hear the occupation's response," one of the two Hamas officials told Reuters, asking not to be identified.</p>

<p>Another Palestinian official with knowledge of the ceasefire deliberations said Israel was in talks with the Qataris and that a response was expected within days.</p>

<h3><strong>Protests In Israel</strong></h3>

<p>In Israel, protesters took to the streets across the country to press the government to agree to the Gaza ceasefire deal, which would bring back hostages still being held in Gaza.</p>

<p>They blocked rush-hour traffic at major intersections across the country, picketed politicians' houses and briefly set fire to tyres on the main Tel Aviv-Jerusalem highway before police cleared the way.</p>

<p>In Gaza, Palestinian health officials said at least 15 people were killed in Israeli strikes.</p>

<p>Among them were Ehab Al-Ghussein, the Hamas-appointed deputy minister of labour whose wife and children were killed in May, and three other people killed in a strike at a church-run school in western Gaza City sheltering families, Hamas media and the Civil Emergency Service said.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said that after it took steps to minimise the risk of civilians being harmed there, it struck militants who were hiding in the school, as well as a facility in the vicinity where weapons were being made.</p>

<p>In central and northern areas of Rafah, on the southern Gaza border with Egypt, Israeli tanks deepened their raids. Health officials there said they had recovered three bodies of Palestinians killed by Israeli fire in the eastern part of the city.</p>

<p>The armed wings of Hamas and Islamic Jihad, an allied militant group, said fighters had attacked Israeli forces in several locations Gaza Strip with anti-tank rockets and mortar bombs.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said its forces had killed 30 Palestinian gunmen in Rafah in the past day, and that one of its soldiers was killed in combat.</p>

<p>In Shejaia, an eastern suburb of Gaza City, the military said its forces had killed several gunmen, and located weapons and explosives. It published a drone video showing gunmen, some appearing to be wounded or dead, in a house.</p>

<p>Reuters could not immediately verify the video.</p>

<p>The conflict was triggered on Oct. 7 when fighters led by Hamas, which controlled Gaza, attacked southern Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking around 250 hostages, according to Israeli figures.</p>

<p>More than 38,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's military onslaught, according to Gaza health officials, and the coastal enclave has largely been reduced to rubble.</p>

<p>Gaza's health ministry does not distinguish between combatants and non-combatants, but officials say most of the dead throughout the war have been civilians. Israel has lost 324 soldiers in Gaza, and says at least a third of the Palestinian dead are fighters.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The civil defence agency in Hamas-run Gaza said a strike Sunday on a school sheltering displaced Palestinians killed at least four people, the second such Israeli attack in two days.</p>

<p>The Israeli military, which has long accused Palestinian operatives of using schools and other civilian infrastructure, confirmed the strike "in the area of the school" in Gaza City.</p>

<p>It said in a statement the school complex was used as a hideout and housed "a Hamas weapons manufacturing facility".</p>

<p>The civil defence agency said Ihab al-Ghusain, the Hamas government's deputy labour minister, was among those killed in the strike on the Holy Family school.</p>

<p>The strike came a day after a UN-run school in the central Nuseirat refugee camp was hit, in an attack that the Gaza health ministry said killed 16 people and drew condemnation from the United Nations. Israel said militants were hiding there.</p>

<p>Hamas has repeatedly denied Israeli accusations that militants were hiding in civilian infrastructure.</p>

<p>The vast majority of the Gaza Strip's 2.4 million people have been displaced by the war, now in its 10th month, and many have taken shelter in UN-run schools across the besieged territory.</p>

<p>The UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, expressed outrage at the repeated attacks on its premises.</p>

<p>"Another day. Another month. Another school hit," UNRWA chief Philippe Lazzarini said on social media platform X.</p>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>UNRWA spokesperson Juliette Touma told AFP that 190 -- or more than half -- of the agency's facilities in Gaza have been hit, "some more than once", since the war began with Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel.</p>

<p>"When the war started we closed the schools and they became shelters," she said.</p>

<p>Up to Thursday, 194 UNRWA workers had been killed, Touma added.</p>

<p>Since then, the UN agency reported separately that another two were killed in an Israeli attack on Saturday.</p>

<p>There have been 450 "incidents" involving UNRWA buildings during the war, Touma said, saying the damage is "unprecedented in the history of the UN".</p>

<p>"Any hits on UN facilities are shocking and there has been a blatant disregard for international humanitarian law in regard to this conflict," she added.</p>

<p>The October 7 attack on southern Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,195 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.</p>

<p>Hamas also seized hostages, 116 of whom remain in Gaza including 42 the military says are dead.</p>

<p>In response, Israel has carried out a military offensive that has killed at least 38,153 people in Gaza, also mostly civilians, according to data from the territory's health ministry.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Hamas official said Sunday the Palestinian group was ready to discuss a hostage release deal with Israel even without a "complete" ceasefire.</p>

<p>The apparent easing of Hamas's position comes as long-stalled diplomatic efforts to secure a ceasefire and hostage release have gathered pace with a new proposal and meetings hosted by Qatari and Egyptian mediators.</p>

<p>"Hamas had previously required that Israel agree to a complete and permanent ceasefire," the top official told AFP as the war entered its 10th month.</p>

<p>But mediators have offered assurances "that as long as the... negotiations continued, the ceasefire would continue", said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity.</p>

<p>Israel, which vowed to destroy Hamas in response to the group's October 7 attack that sparked the war, has repeatedly rejected demands for a permanent ceasefire.</p>

<p>US President Joe Biden announced a plan in late May that included an initial six-week truce and the exchange of hostages held by Hamas for Palestinian prisoners held in Israel.</p>

<p>Talks quickly stalled but a US official said Thursday that a new text from Hamas "moves the process forward and may provide the basis for closing the deal".</p>

<p>Egypt's state-linked Al-Qahera News said late Saturday that Cairo was "hosting Israeli and American delegations" and mediators were in contact with Hamas amid "intensive Egyptian meetings this week with all parties".</p>

<p>In Israel, anti-government protesters demanding a hostage release deal blocked roads in the commercial hub of Tel Aviv on a nationwide "disruption day" from 6:29 am, the time Hamas launched their attack on October 7.</p>

<p>Data scientist Yoni Peleg, 34, said protesters were crying "out for help... to end the war" and pressure Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government to secure the release of the remaining hostages.</p>

<p>Hamas's unprecedented October 7 attack on southern Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,195 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.</p>

<p>Hamas seized 251 hostages, 116 of whom remain in Gaza, including 42 the military says are dead.</p>

<p>Israel has carried out a military offensive that has killed at least 38,153 people in Gaza, also mostly civilians, according to data from the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory.</p>

<p>Israel has said it would send a delegation to continue talks with Qatari mediators, though a government spokesman said Friday there were still "gaps" with Hamas.</p>

<p>An official with knowledge of the mediation said US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) director William Burns would also go to Qatar this week.</p>

<p>If full negotiations start, Hamas expects them to take between two to three weeks, according to the official from the Islamist movement.</p>

<h3><strong>Schools hit</strong></h3>

<p>The fighting and bombardment in Gaza raged on unabated, with witnesses reporting strikes and shelling in the central Bureij refugee camp, the far-southern Rafah city and elsewhere.</p>

<p>The Palestine Red Crescent said two children were among six dead when a house in central Gaza was hit, and paramedics reported nine fatalities in two strikes on Gaza City in the north of the coastal territory.</p>

<p>An AFP correspondent said Israeli drones were firing in Gaza City's Shujaiya district, which has seen intense battles for nearly two weeks.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said that in Shujaiya, its troops killed "several" militants and dismantled militant infrastructure.</p>

<p>The military issued on Sunday an evacuation order for a nearby area of Gaza City. Similar orders in the past have preceded military incursions.</p>

<p>Israeli forces were also "conducting operations" in Rafah and around the municipality building in nearby Khan Yunis, which according to the military was being used by Hamas fighters.</p>

<p>The latest Gaza health ministry toll includes 16 people killed Saturday in a strike on a UN-run school turned shelter in central Gaza's Nuseirat refugee camp.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Israel's military said the school had been used by militants.</p>

<p>Another strike Sunday on a church-run school in Gaza City killed at least four people, said the civil defence agency.</p>

<p>Israel's military confirmed the strike "in the area of" Holy Family School, which it said served as a militant hideout.</p>

<h3><strong>Plea for 'caution'</strong></h3>

<p>Lebanon's Hezbollah movement, a Hamas ally, fired rocket salvoes at northern Israel in the latest cross-border clashes that have sparked fears of a full-scale war.</p>

<p>Since the Gaza war began, Israeli forces and Hezbollah have exchanged almost daily cross-border fire, with attacks and rhetoric escalating in recent weeks.</p>

<p>Israel on Saturday struck deep inside eastern Lebanon, killing a Hezbollah operative.</p>

<p>Hezbollah said it had targeted an Israeli army base west of Tiberias "in response to the... assassination" carried out the day before, later claiming more barrages of rockets.</p>

<p>Israeli officials reported four people wounded by shrapnel, including a 31-year-old man who was "in serious and stable condition", according to the Galilee Medical Center.</p>

<p>Britain's new Prime Minister Keir Starmer, in his first telephone conversation with Netanyahu on Sunday, said the border clashes were "concerning" and urged all sides to exercise "caution".</p>

<p>A spokesperson for Starmer said he also "set out the clear and urgent need for a ceasefire" in Gaza as well as hostage release and "an immediate increase" in aid into the besieged territory.</p>

<p>Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant, meeting troops in the annexed Golan Heights, said "we continue to fight" even if a deal with Hamas is reached.</p>

<p>"I very much hope that we will be able to reach it", Gallant said, according to a statement from his office.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>British Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Sunday called on all sides to exercise "caution" on the border between Israel and Lebanon, in his first telephone conversation since he was elected with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.</p>

<p>Starmer told his counterpart the "situation on the northern border of Israel was very concerning, and it was crucial all parties acted with caution", a spokesperson for his 10 Downing Street office said.</p>

<p>Lebanon's Hezbollah movement on Sunday fired another 20 rockets at northern Israel, leaving one person injured there, the latest cross-border attacks launched in solidarity with Gaza's Palestinian group Hamas.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hezbollah has traded near daily fire with the Israeli army across Lebanon's southern border since its Palestinian ally Hamas attacked Israel last year, triggering the war in Gaza.</p>

<p>Discussing the conflict, the prime minister reiterated his condolences for the mass loss of life during the October 7 attacks, the spokesperson said.</p>

<p>"He then set out the clear and urgent need for a ceasefire, the return of hostages and an immediate increase in the volume of humanitarian aid reaching civilians."</p>

<p>In his conversation with Netanyahu, Starmer added that it was also "important to ensure the long-term conditions for a two-state solution were in place, including ensuring the Palestinian Authority had the financial means to operate effectively".</p>

<p>Efforts towards a truce are continuing with US, Qatari and Egyptian mediators hoping to halt the worst-ever Gaza war, which has caused mass civilian casualties and devastated the coastal territory.</p>

<p>The spokesperson said the prime minister also spoke by phone to Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas.</p>

<p>Starmer told Abbas that his "longstanding policy on recognition to contribute to a peace process had not changed, and it was the undeniable right of Palestinians".</p>

<p>The October 7 attack on southern Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,195 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hamas also seized 251 hostages, 116 of whom remain in Gaza, including 42 the military says are dead.</p>

<p>In response, Israel's military offensive has killed at least 38,153 people in Gaza, also mostly civilians, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-ruled territory.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Embattled US President Joe Biden sought out safe ground Sunday, courting Black voters at a church as he hit the campaign trail to salvage his reelection bid and silence growing calls to quit.</p>

<p>"We're all imperfect beings," the 81-year-old told a welcoming congregation in Philadelphia, where he received a jolt of rejuvenation from worshippers who chanted "four more years."</p>

<p>Biden has dug in despite an uprising among some Democratic lawmakers, analysts and voters concerned he lacks the mental acuity and physical fitness to serve a second term -- worries brought to the fore by a disastrous debate performance last month against Republican challenger Donald Trump.</p>

<p>But the president has unequivocally declared he is fit to serve, the only one who can defeat Trump, is staying in the race.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On Sunday, he embarked on a two-stop swing in the battleground state of Pennsylvania, before he hosts the NATO leaders' summit in Washington later this week.</p>

<p>So far, five Democratic lawmakers have called on Biden to drop out, with the drumbeat of dissent slowly rising.</p>

<p>Two high-profile congressional Democrats on Sunday stopped short of calling for Biden to step aside, but warned he still needed to win over worried voters.</p>

<p>"There's only one reason" the race between Trump and Biden "is close, and that's the president's age," Representative Adam Schiff told NBC's "Meet the Press."</p>

<p>As some speculate about Biden handing off the campaign to Vice President Kamala Harris, Schiff said he thought she "could win overwhelmingly."</p>

<p>Democratic Senator Chris Murphy meanwhile said "the president needs to do more," including unscripted events, to reassure voters.</p>

<p>"This week is going to be absolutely critical," Murphy told CNN's "State of the Union."</p>

<p>Biden himself largely avoided discussing the crisis at hand when he gave a seven-minute address at Mt. Airy Church of God in Christ, speaking to a constituency he has embraced throughout his half-century political career.</p>

<p>"It's good to be home," he said to cheers, before joking briefly about his age.</p>

<p>"I know I look like I'm only 40 years old but I've been around a little bit," he said.</p>

<h3><strong>Democrats debate</strong></h3>

<p>Biden's campaign stops come as House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries scheduled a virtual meeting of senior Democratic representatives Sunday to discuss the best way forward, and Democratic Senator Mark Warner is reportedly working to convene a similar forum in the Senate.</p>

<p>With Washington ruminating, First Lady Jill Biden is scheduled to campaign for her husband Monday in Georgia, Florida and North Carolina, while the president preps for the NATO summit beginning Tuesday.</p>

<p>Here, too, he will find himself having to reassure allies at a time when many European countries fear a Trump victory in November.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The 78-year-old Republican has long criticized the defense alliance, voiced admiration for Russian strongman Vladimir Putin, and insisted he could bring about a quick end to the fighting in Ukraine.</p>

<p>For now, Democratic heavyweights are largely keeping a lid on any simmering discontent with their leader -- at least in public.</p>

<p>But with election day just four months away, any move to replace Biden as the nominee would need to be made sooner rather than later, and the party will be scrutinized for any signs of more open rebellion.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, for Biden and his team, the strategy seems to be to ride it out.</p>

<p>The campaign has unveiled an intense battle plan for July, including an avalanche of TV spots and trips to all the key states.</p>

<p>That includes a visit to the US Southwest during the Republican convention July 15-18, at which Trump will be anointed the party's official presidential nominee.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Newly-elected Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Sunday began a whistlestop tour of UK nations, promising an "immediate reset" of relations with the devolved governments of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Newly-elected Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Sunday began a whistlestop tour of UK nations, promising an "immediate reset" of relations with the devolved governments of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.</p>

<p>Starmer was due to meet Scotland's First Minister and leader of the pro-separatist Scottish National Party (SNP) John Swinney in Edinburgh ahead of trips to Cardiff and Belfast expected on Monday.</p>

<p>The meeting comes as the SNP was almost wiped out at last week's election which put Starmer's Labour Party in power by a landslide.</p>

<p>Labour, which crushed Rishi Sunak's ruling Conservatives at the polls, also overturned more than a decade of SNP domination in Scotland by capturing the majority of its 57 seats.</p>

<p>Swinney lamented a "very, very difficult and damaging" election result for his party.</p>

<p>He had set the party's sights on winning 29 seats as a mandate for reopening negotiations with the British government for another independence referendum, but it returned only nine MPs.</p>

<h3><strong>'Seat at the table'</strong></h3>

<p>Under ex-premier Tony Blair, Labour was the architect of devolving power to the regions in the late 1990s with the setting up of parliaments or national assemblies in Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast.</p>

<p>But under the Conservatives leaders in the three capitals complained that they were increasingly sidelined.</p>

<p>Starmer said disagreement could be turned into cooperation "and a genuine seat at the table" to deliver the UK-wide change he has promised.</p>

<p>"That begins today with an immediate reset of my government's approach to working with the first and deputy first ministers, because meaningful cooperation centred on respect will be key to delivering change across our United Kingdom."</p>

<p>The devolved administrations have the power to set policy in a range of areas such as education and housing.</p>

<p>Responsibility for policy on matters such as national defence, international relations and the monarchy, however, are the sole preserve of the UK-wide Westminster parliament in London.</p>

<h3><strong>SNP in turmoil</strong></h3>

<p>Swinney said he was looking forward to discussions on shared priorities.</p>

<p>Those included "eradicating child poverty, growing the economy, prioritising net zero, and ensuring effective public services", he said in a statement.</p>

<p>The SNP has dominated in Scotland in the last three UK elections, peaking with the 2015 vote when it won 56 out of 59 seats.</p>

<p>But the party has been in turmoil for months as voters tire of its 17 years in charge of the devolved Scottish parliament in Edinburgh.</p>

<p>Critics accuse it of focusing on independence at the expense of key issues such as the cost-of-living crisis, education and health.</p>

<p>Support for the SNP has also slumped amid the party finances scandal that saw former SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon's husband, Peter Murrell, charged with embezzlement. Murrell is the party's former chief executive.</p>

<p>Sturgeon herself was arrested, but released without charge.</p>

<h3><strong>'Control immigration'</strong></h3>

<p>Starmer will make his debut on the international stage as leader when he flies to Washington next week for a NATO summit.</p>

<p>Foreign Minister David Lammy meanwhile travelled to Berlin to meet his German counterpart Annalena Baerbock, in his first in-post trip.</p>

<p>The ministers discussed issues from boosting NATO's support for Ukraine to the situation in the Middle East, the German foreign ministry wrote on X, formerly Twitter.</p>

<p>"The United Kingdom is an indispensable part of Europe," the ministry wrote, adding that Germany is "working with the new UK government to see how the UK an move closer to the EU".</p>

<p>Earlier Sunday, as Starmer began his second full day at the helm, former three-time Labour prime minister Blair made an early intervention, urging him to have a "plan to control immigration".</p>

<p>Blair warned Starmer that the anti-immigration Reform UK Party also posed a challenge to Labour, not just the Conservative Party.</p>

<p>"We need a plan to control immigration. If we don't have rules, we get prejudices," Blair wrote in the Sunday Times, advocating the introduction of digital ID.</p>

<p>Business Minister Jonathan Reynolds later ruled the idea out.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hamas is waiting for a response from Israel on its ceasefire proposal, two officials from the Palestinian group said on Sunday, five days after it accepted a key part of a U.S. plan aimed at ending the nine-month-old war in Gaza.</p>

<p>"We have left our response with the mediators and are waiting to hear the occupation's response," one of the two Hamas officials told Reuters, asking not to be identified.</p>

<p>The three-phase plan for the Palestinian enclave was put forward at the end of May by U.S. President Joe Biden and is being mediated by Qatar and Egypt. It aims to end the war and free around 120 Israeli hostages being held by Hamas.</p>

<p>Another Palestinian official, with knowledge of the ceasefire deliberations, said Israel was in talks with the Qataris.</p>

<p>"They have discussed with them Hamas' response and they promised to give them Israel's response within days," the official, who asked not to be identified, told Reuters on Sunday.</p>

<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said that negotiations would continue this week but has not given any detailed timeline.</p>

<p>Later in the day, an Israeli air strike killed Ehab Al-Ghussein, the Hamas-appointed deputy minister of labour, and three other people at a church-run school in western Gaza City sheltering Christian and Muslim families, Hamas media and the Civil Emergency Service said.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said it was looking into the report. Ghussein's wife and children had already been killed in an Israeli strike in May.</p>

<p>Hamas, which controls Gaza, has dropped a key demand that Israel first commit to a permanent ceasefire before it would sign an agreement. Instead, it said it would allow negotiations to achieve that throughout the six-week first phase, a Hamas source told Reuters on Saturday on condition of anonymity because the talks are private.</p>

<p>A Palestinian official close to the peace efforts has said the proposal could lead to a framework agreement if embraced by Israel and would end the war.</p>

<p>U.S. Central Intelligence Agency Director William Burns will travel to Qatar this week for negotiations, a source familiar with the matter said.</p>

<p>The conflict was triggered nine months ago on Oct. 7 when Hamas-led fighters attacked southern Israel from Gaza, killing 1,200 people and taking around 250 hostages in the worst assault in Israel's history, according to official Israeli figures.</p>

<p>More than 38,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's military onslaught, according to Gaza health officials, and the coastal enclave has largely been reduced to rubble.</p>

<p>The U.N. agency for Palestinians, UNRWA, called the situation increasingly tragic, saying in a post on X, "families continue to face forced displacement, massive destruction and constant fear. Essential supplies are lacking, the heat is unbearable, diseases are spreading".</p>

<h3><strong>Protests In Israel</strong></h3>

<p>Protesters took to the streets across Israel on Sunday to pressure the government to reach an accord to bring back hostages still being held in Gaza.</p>

<p>They blocked rush hour traffic at major intersections across the country, picketed politicians houses and briefly set fire to tires on the main Tel Aviv-Jerusalem highway before police cleared the way.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, fighting continued to rage across Gaza, and north Israel came under rocket attack from Iran-backed Hezbollah in Lebanon.</p>

<p>Air raid sirens sent residents of 24 Israeli towns running for shelter. One person was seriously wounded, police said. Hezbollah said it had fired rockets at an army base.</p>

<p>In Gaza, Palestinian health officials said at least 15 people were killed in separate Israeli military strikes on Sunday.</p>

<p>An Israeli air strike on a house in the town of Zawayda, in central Gaza, killed at least six people and wounded several others, while six others were killed in an air strike on a house in western Gaza, the health officials said.</p>

<p>Tanks deepened their raids in central and northern areas of Rafah on the southern border with Egypt. Health officials there said they had recovered three bodies of Palestinians killed by Israeli fire in the eastern part of the city.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said on Sunday its forces had killed 30 Palestinian gunmen in Rafah during close combat and air strikes in the past day.</p>

<p>In Shejaia, an eastern suburb of Gaza City, the military said its forces killed several Palestinian gunmen, and located weapons and explosives.</p>

<p>The armed wings of Hamas and Islamic Jihad, an allied fighter group, said fighters attacked Israeli forces in several locations across the Gaza Strip with anti-tank rockets and mortar bombs.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A woman in New Jersey is suing the ride-hailing company Lyft and one of its drivers after she had a ''traumatic'' experience&nbsp;mid-ride. According to <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/07/06/us-news/lyft-driver-peed-while-behind-the-wheel-rider-claims-in-lawsuit/">New York Post</a></em>, the unnamed woman was on her way to work when the driver allegedly exposed himself to her and began urinating in a plastic container. The incident happened in March this year, when the woman&nbsp;called the Lyft to get from her Fort Lee, NJ home to her job at Mount Sinai West in Midtown.</p>

<p>''The driver took his p***s out of his pants and began urinating in a plastic container … somewhere on a public road on the westside of Manhattan,” the woman claimed in her Manhattan Supreme Court filing against Lyft and driver.</p>

<p>The woman has alleged that the incident left her shocked, angry, and caused lasting depression along with other psychological and emotional distress. She argued in her complaint that the&nbsp;alleged "public lewdness and exposure of himself" amounts to sexual assault.</p>

<p>She also added that the driver identified as Luis ''had the apparent ability to cause imminent harmful or offensive bodily contact through the lewd act.''</p>

<p>In court documents, she described the behavior as "so outrageous, shocking, abhorrent, and despicable that it exceeded the bounds of decency."</p>

<p>She alleged that Lyft was negligent in hiring Luis and failed to protect passengers from "sexual predators." The lawsuit further accused the company of neglecting to recognize "signs that (Luis) was abusing his position to expose himself to passengers."</p>

<p>The woman said that she wishes to remain anonymous to avoid not only embarrassment but also ''the social stigmatization associated with having been sexually assaulted." According to court papers, she continues to feel "shame and anxiety'' and has asked the court to shield her name to protect her privacy and well-being.</p>

<p>In 2021, the San Francisco-based company released its <a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/q8mvene1wzq4/4jxkFTH5YCQK8T96STULMd/4269e14dbcb8578ff64da45df08b8147/Community_Safety_Report.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Community Safety Report</a>&nbsp;detailing 4,158 reports of sexual assault during rides from 2017 through 2019, including 360 involving rape.</p>

<p>These incidents happened despite Lyft screening its drivers&nbsp;for criminal offences and driving infractions prior to being hired.&nbsp;The company also utilizes a third-party firm to conduct further background checks, including a nationwide sex offender registry search.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chinese Premier Li Qiang on Sunday congratulated new British Prime Minister Keir Starmer on his election, state media reported, the first senior leader in Beijing to do so publicly.</p>

<p>China is "willing to work with the new UK government to consolidate mutual political trust and expand mutually beneficial cooperation", Li told Starmer, according to state news agency Xinhua.</p>

<p>Their call came after days of silence from top officials in Beijing, with the Chinese foreign ministry saying only that it noted the results of the UK election.&nbsp;</p>

<p>By comparison, Chinese leader Xi Jinping congratulated Iran's incoming president Masoud Pezeshkian just hours after his election on Saturday.</p>

<p>China was Britain's fifth-largest trading partner as of 2023, according to the UK Department for Business and Trade.</p>

<p>But diplomatic relations between the two countries have been icy in recent years, with Beijing and London sparring over tightening communist control in former British colony Hong Kong.</p>

<p>The two sides have also traded accusations of espionage, with Beijing saying last month that MI6 had recruited Chinese state employees to spy for the UK.</p>

<p>Xinhua on Sunday said Li told Starmer that the "strengthening of bilateral coordination and cooperation was in the interests of both sides".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>India's Ambassador to Russia, Vinay Kumar, has called Prime Minister Narendra Modi's upcoming visit to Russia "very significant" and noted that it is taking place after a gap of three years.</p>

<p>Speaking to ANI, Vinay Kumar stated that the visit of PM Modi is "very important" for the two leaders to exchange views on developments in bilateral ties and discuss other regional and important issues of mutual interest.</p>

<p>He noted said the two nations have the tradition of annual exchange of summit-level meetings between the Russian President and Indian Prime Minister and added that the last one took place in 2021.</p>

<p>Notably, this will be the 22nd India-Russia Annual Bilateral Summit. The 21st bilateral Summit was held in December 2021 when Russian President Vladimir Putin visited New Delhi.</p>

<p>Asked about the importance of PM Modi's first overseas visit after being sworn in as PM of India for the third time, he responded, "The visit is very significant. It is taking place after a gap of three years. We have the tradition of the annual exchange of summit-level meetings between the President of the Russian Federation and the Prime Minister of India and the last one was in 2021. So, since then, a lot has changed around the world, but also our relations have expanded."</p>

<p>"Russia is now one of the very important sources of energy resources in India. Also, trade has expanded in other areas. So this visit becomes very important for the leaders to exchange views on all these developments in the bilateral relationship, but also other regional and international issues of mutual interest," he added.</p>

<p>Vinay Kumar said that PM Modi during his visit will have a private meeting with Russian President Putin, attend the lunch-on hosted by Putin and visit an exhibition centre. He said that PM Modi will address a gathering of Indian community members in Russia.</p>

<p>Elaborating on PM Modi's schedule during his visit to Russia, the Indian envoy said, "The program includes a private meeting with President Putin, delegation-level talks, restricted talks, lunch on hosted by President Putin for Prime Minister and his delegation, visit to an exhibition center in the Badenha complex, Rosatom Pavilion, and also exchange of documents which we are preparing to sign and exchange during the visit."</p>

<p>"Prime Minister will also address a gathering of Indian community members who are very eagerly looking forward to this visit to Moscow by Prime Minister after a gap of nine years. The last Prime Ministerial visit to Moscow was in 2015. So these are some of the important elements of the program," he added.</p>

<p>Notably, PM Modi will be in Moscow on July 8-9 at the invitation of the Russian President to hold the 22nd India-Russia Annual Summit.</p>

<p>Asked about the issues that will be discussed during the meeting between PM Modi and Russian President Putin, he said, "Well, the first thing that I want to say is that I'm in no position to prejudge what the two leaders will talk. But, I can certainly tell you that the visit is in the framework of our annual exchange of the Presidential and Prime ministerial visit that we have in world summits and so the context is bilateral. But, certainly global issues, including this war that you mentioned, will be discussed. And the leaders will exchange their views and their perspective on these developments."</p>

<p>Vinay Kumar stressed that the trade between India and Russia has expanded and crossed USD 65 billion. However, he noted that the trade is heavily in favour of the Russian side. He said that India is looking at new items, including agricultural products to export to Russia.</p>

<p>Speaking about trade between the two nations, he said, "Trade, as I was mentioning, in the last three years, trade has expanded, crossed USD 65 billion. We have two challenges. One, to balance the trade, because trade is very heavily in favour of the Russian side. So expanding India's trade basket, export items, and also increase in the quantity to better balance the trade, while at the same time finding ways and means to sustain this growth in bilateral trade."</p>

<p>"We are looking at new items, including agricultural products to export to Russia, ceramic tiles, auto components and engineering goods, chemical products, of course, pharmaceuticals has been one of the traditional areas, products that we have exported to Russia. We want to increase their volume and also add new items to the trade basket," he added.</p>

<p>Calling defence an important pillar of India-Russia ties, he said that India has bought several platforms and their spare parts from Russia. Vinay Kumar said that India will discuss and look at further increasing this trend of co-production of defence items in India.</p>

<p>"Defence is a very important pillar of the relationship. There are a number of platforms which India has bought from Russia and their spare parts and also manufacturing of many of the components and spare parts in India. A lot is being done now already. We will discuss and look at further increasing this trend of co-production as we say of defence items in India," he said.</p>

<p>Stressing that connectivity is important for trade and people-to-people exchange, he stated, "Connectivity, similarly, is very important for trade and also people-to-people exchanges. International North-South Transport Corridor is very much on the agenda, and there have been some cargo movement along that. New routes are also coming up, Arctic route or Northern Sea route, as it is called, and we are looking for institutionalizing and expanding cooperation in that sector also."</p>

<p>During his visit to Moscow, PM Modi and Putin will review the entire range of multifaceted relations between the two countries and exchange views on contemporary regional and global issues of mutual interest, according to Ministry of External Affairs earlier press release.</p>

<p>Notably, PM Modi and Putin have met 16 times over the past 10 year. The last in-person meeting between the two leaders took place on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) Summit in Uzbekistan's Samarkand in 2021.</p>

<p>PM Modi has been conferred the highest Russian state honor 'Order of the Holy Apostle Andrew the First' in 2019. After concluding his visit to Russia, PM Modi will travel to Austria.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel carried out deadly air strikes in the Gaza Strip on Sunday as the war entered its 10th month, with fighting raging across the Palestinian territory and fresh diplomatic efforts underway to halt the violence.</p>

<p>Lebanon's Hezbollah movement fired another 20 rockets at northern Israel, leaving one person injured there, the latest cross-border attacks launched in solidarity with Gaza's Palestinian group Hamas.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Efforts towards a truce continued with US, Qatari and Egyptian mediators hoping to halt the worst-ever Gaza war, which has caused mass civilian casualties and devastated the coastal territory since Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel.</p>

<p>Egypt's Al-Qahera News reported that Cairo was "hosting Israeli and American delegations to discuss the outstanding points" for a ceasefire and hostage release deal, citing an unnamed high-level official source.</p>

<p>Mediators were in contact with Hamas amid "intensive Egyptian meetings this week with all parties to push efforts" for a truce, said the news report late Saturday, without giving further details or dates.</p>

<p>Israel has also said it would send a delegation in the coming days to continue talks with Qatari mediators, even though Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's spokesman said Friday that "gaps" remained with Hamas.</p>

<p>US President Joe Biden announced a plan in late May that included an initial six-week truce and the exchange of hostages for Palestinian prisoners.</p>

<p>Talks subsequently stalled, but a US official said Thursday that a new proposal from Hamas "moves the process forward and may provide the basis for closing the deal".</p>

<p>Senior Hamas official Osama Hamdan told AFP that the group's new ideas had been "conveyed by the mediators to the American side, which welcomed them and passed them on to the Israeli side", adding that "now the ball is in the Israeli court".</p>

<h3><strong>Heavy clashes</strong></h3>

<p>The fighting and bombardment in besieged Gaza raged on unabated on Sunday, with medics and emergency services in the Hamas-run territory reporting yet more deaths in several strikes.</p>

<p>The Palestinian Red Crescent said the bodies of six people including two children were taken to Al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital in the central city of Deir al-Balah.</p>

<p>And paramedics said six people were killed in one strike on a house in Gaza City and three in another elsewhere in Gaza's largest urban area.</p>

<p>An AFP correspondent said Israeli drones were firing in Gaza City's Shujaiya district, which has been largely evacuated and rocked by intense battles for two weeks.</p>

<p>The Israeli army said that in Shujaiya, its "troops eliminated several terrorists, dismantled terror infrastructure sites and located numerous weapons, including explosive devices, AK-47 rifles, machine guns and pistols".</p>

<p>It also said 30 "terrorists" had been killed in far-southern Rafah over the past day and that Israeli forces had carried out an operation in nearby Khan Yunis where Hamas had taken up position in a municipality building.</p>

<p>On Saturday, the Gaza health ministry said 16 people were killed in a strike on a school run by the UN agency for Palestinian refugees UNRWA that was sheltering displaced people in Nuseirat, in central Gaza.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said its aircraft had targeted "terrorists" operating around the Al-Jawni school.</p>

<h3><strong>'Catastrophic hunger'</strong></h3>

<p>The war began with Hamas's unprecedented October 7 attack on southern Israel that resulted in the deaths of 1,195 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.</p>

<p>Hamas also seized 251 hostages, 116 of whom remain in Gaza, including 42 the military says are dead.</p>

<p>In response, Israel has carried out a military offensive that has killed at least 38,098 people in Gaza, also mostly civilians, according to data from the health ministry in the Hamas-ruled territory.</p>

<p>The war has uprooted 90 percent of Gaza's population, left almost 500,000 people enduring "catastrophic" hunger and shuttered most hospitals, UN agencies say.</p>

<p>"The situation is very difficult," said Dr Muhammad Salha, acting director of Al-Awda Hospital in Jabalia.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"There is no fuel in the hospital to work. We only operate the small generator for two hours a day and we have postponed many scheduled operations due to the lack of fuel."</p>

<h3><strong>Hezbollah rockets</strong></h3>

<p>Amid the Gaza war, Israel and Iran-backed Hezbollah have exchanged almost daily cross-border fire and the attacks and rhetoric have escalated over the past month, sparking fears of a full-scale war.</p>

<p>While the exchanges have been largely restricted to the border areas, Israel has repeatedly struck deep inside eastern Lebanon, including on Saturday in a strike that killed a Hezbollah operative.</p>

<p>Early on Sunday, air raid sirens again sounded across northern Israel and the army then reported that 20 rockets were fired, some of which were intercepted by air defence systems.</p>

<p>One person was wounded by shrapnel in Kfar Zeitim near Tiberias, around 30 kilometres (over 18 miles) inside Israel, local police said, adding they were in stable condition.</p>

<p>Hezbollah said that "in response to the attack and assassination that the Israeli enemy carried out", it had targeted "one of the main bases" in northern Israel, west of Tiberias, with "dozens of Katyusha rockets".</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An overnight Ukrainian drone attack set a Russian munitions depot ablaze the Voronezh region, near the two countries' shared border, Russian and Ukrainian officials said Sunday.</p>

<p>"Several drones were detected and destroyed overnight by air defence systems above the Voronezh region," regional governor Alexander Gusev wrote on Telegram.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Their falling debris set off a fire in a depot" in the Podgorensky district, about 80 kilometres (50 miles) from the Ukrainian borderm.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Explosives began to detonate", Gusev said, adding that there were no indications anybody had been hurt.</p>

<p>Rescue teams were at the scene and Gusev said local people living near the depot were being evacuated.</p>

<p>A Ukrainian defence source told AFP that its drones hit the munitions factory in an overnight attack.</p>

<p>"The enemy stored surface-to-surface and surface-to-air missiles, shells for tanks and artillery and boxes of ammunition" at the site, which was hit by drones resulting in a "powerful" explosion, the source said.</p>

<p>Russia and Ukraine have used drones, including large explosive devices with a range of hundreds of kilometres (miles), extensively since Russia launched its military offensive in February 2022.</p>

<p>Ukraine has stepped up its attacks on Russian territory this year, targeting both energy sites it says supply the Russian army and towns and villages just across the border.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

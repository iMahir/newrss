       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A woman from Brooklyn, United States, who fell from a golf cart is suing Hard Rock Cafe &amp; Hotel in the Dominican Republic for $500,000 (Rs 4 crore). Taylor O'Leary claimed in the complaint that she suffered several injuries after she fell out of her golf cart in July 2022 because the seat was wet and slippery, as per a report in the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/08/17/us-news/nyc-woman-sues-hard-rock-for-500k-after-falling-out-of-golf-cart/"><em>New York Post.</em></a></p>

<p>The incident happened at the Hard Rock Golf Club in Punta Cana. According to the lawsuit, the 27-year-old, who was a guest at the hotel, filed the complaint against the establishment and its corporate owner, Hard Rock Cafe International.</p>

<p>Celebrities like Justin Bieber, Shakira, and Mariah Carey are said to love this five-star luxury resort, which is located along Macao Beach.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in June, a Disneyland employee died two days after suffering a head injury in a golf cart accident, as per a report in The Hollywood Reporter. The 60-year-old woman named Bonnye Mavis Lear was in the backstage area of the California theme park when the incident occurred.</p>

<p>Anaheim Police and Anaheim Fire and Rescue personnel arrived at the resort on Wednesday after they were informed about the accident. She was sitting as a passenger and struck her head after falling from the moving cart. The 60-year-old was then taken to a local hospital in grave condition.</p>

<p>The 60-year-old worked for 24 years at the Disneyland Resort, where she "supported membership services at Club 33," the park's exclusive private dining club.</p>

<p>Disney California Adventure Attractions cast member Rae Delgado, wrote on Facebook that Ms Lear suffered brain swelling and a fractured skull from the accident. "Bonnye was travelling on a rear-facing seat of a golf cart along with 3 passengers behind Critter Country. The driver of the vehicle was driving at least 20 mph on the route. The golf cart came in contact with a bump/dip in the road which caused Bonnye to react immediately. As she went to grab the handrail, it gave way and sent her out of the vehicle. ... She was deemed unconscious when paramedics arrived."</p>

<p>Despite the surgery, "it was beyond repair," according to the employee, and Ms Lear was pronounced "brain dead".</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An unrelentingly bitter US presidential race, defined by name-calling, attack ads and stunted campaigning, has so far left little space for discussion about climate change, despite the world experiencing unprecedented heat and disasters.</p>

<p>But with Donald Trump now facing Kamala Harris rather than Joe Biden, the Republican has used recent rallies to echo misinformation and memes on X, including fictional bans on red meat and gas stoves.</p>

<p>The aim? To undermine Harris.</p>

<p>"Kamala called for slashing consumption of red meat to fight climate change," Trump said during a July 27 rally in the state of Minnesota.</p>

<p>The Democratic nominee would "get rid of all cows ... and I guess that at some point, they'll go after the humans," the former president added, echoing "depopulation" conspiracy theories that have plagued Harris in right-wing spaces since she waded into the topic of "climate anxiety" among younger generations at a White House press conference last year.</p>

<p>JD Vance, Trump's running mate, amplified the claims in an August 3 speech in Atlanta, saying Harris "wants to take away your gas stoves, she even wants to take away your ability to eat red meat."</p>

<p>Such climate myths took on a life of their own on X, encouraged by conservative commentators in swing states and MAGA accounts with hundreds of thousands of followers.</p>

<p>However, Harris made no such campaign promise.</p>

<p>She has cooked with a gas stove herself and noted in a 2019 environmental panel that she "love(s) cheeseburgers from time to time," although she has supported the idea of updating dietary guidelines.</p>

<p>"A tried-and-true tactic in politics is to misrepresent your opponent's positions to make them sound extreme and unacceptable. Trump and Vance are doing exactly that with Vice President Harris's positions on climate action," said Edward Maibach, director of George Mason University's Center for Climate Change Communication.</p>

<h3><strong>Harris's climate record&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>The false narratives add to Trump and Vance's criticism of the vice president's stance on issues such as fracking, a violently disruptive underground oil and gas extraction technique.</p>

<p>Harris initially advocated banning the practice in 2019 before becoming Biden's running mate in 2020. She has more recently sought to avoid questions about it, particularly in the crucial swing state of Pennsylvania where fracking is big business.</p>

<p>Still, climate activists have mostly saluted Harris, whose environmental stance has historically been to the left of the president -- notably in going after oil companies as California attorney general.</p>

<p>The Biden administration also pushed a renewable energy shift in passing the Inflation Reduction Act, the largest investment in reducing carbon pollution in US history.</p>

<p>Trump has vehemently opposed the legislation, adopting the slogan "drill, baby, drill" to sum up his fossil fuel-friendly approach.</p>

<p>The League of Conservation Voters, an environmental advocacy group, told AFP the Trump campaign's amplification of misinformation on "widespread bans" constitutes "ridiculous scare tactics" perpetrated to undermine recent "climate progress."</p>

<h3><strong>Potential to 'backfire'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Responding to AFP's request for comment, Harris spokeswoman Lauren Hitt did not address specific claims from Trump and his running mate, but said the Democrat "is focused on a future where all Americans have clean air, clean water, and affordable, reliable energy."</p>

<p>Trump, meanwhile, has repeatedly dismissed the threats of climate change.</p>

<p>"The biggest threat is not global warming, where the ocean is going to rise one-eighth of an inch over the next 400 years," he told Elon Musk on X in mid-August. Musk officially endorsed Trump in July.</p>

<p>More than a third of registered voters disagree, saying global warming is very important to their vote in the 2024 election, according to a recent survey from the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication.</p>

<p>"I suspect the tactic will backfire with a relatively smaller number of uncommitted voters, most of whom are concerned about climate change," Maibach said.</p>

<p>"Trump and Vance attacking VP Harris on her climate positions will hurt them more than help them."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former US President Donald Trump has claimed at an election rally that he is "much better looking" than his Democratic rival for the White House, Vice-President Kamala Harris.</p>

<p>"I am much better looking than her. I think I'm a better-looking person than Kamala," Trump said at an election rally in Pennsylvania, which is one of the battleground states that will determine the race.</p>

<p>Trump appears to have been triggered by a column in The Wall Street Journal that described Harris as beautiful. "You can't take a bad picture of her. Her beauty, plus the social warmth that all who have known her over the years speak of, combines to produce: radiance," Peggy Noonan, the columnist, had written.</p>

<p>Trump leaned into it by calling out to a Republican who is running for US Senate from the state. "You're not allowed to say this anymore. You know, David, don't ever get caught in this trap," Trump said addressing Republican Senate candidate David McCormick in the audience. "David, please don't ever call a woman beautiful, because that will be the end of your political career."</p>

<p>"I am much better looking than her. I'm a better-looking person than Kamala," he said and went on to belittle a sketch of her on a Time magazine cover. He said he thought it was actresses Sophia Loren or Elizabeth Taylor.</p>

<p>Former President Trump also attacked Harris on policy calling the economic plan she announced on Friday as a plan that "will usher communism in the US". He has called it the "Maduro plan", after Nicolas Maduro, the Venezuelan leader.</p>

<p>Trump has used a string of personal slurs against Harris in the last three weeks. He has called her "crazy" and a "lunatic", questioned her ethnicity, and even stated that he is "entitled" to these personal attacks because she makes him angry and she has also attacked him as "weird".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Is America ready to elect a Black woman as its president? Vice President Kamala Harris, who will be officially confirmed as the Democratic US presidential nominee in Chicago next week, is betting that it is.</p>

<p>"In my entire career, I've heard people say when I ran... people aren't ready, it's not your time, nobody like you has done that before," the Democrat said in 2019 when she ran against Joe Biden in the primary presidential campaign.</p>

<p>"I haven't listened and I would suggest that nobody should listen to that kind of conversation."</p>

<p>But Harris's campaign never took off and she left the primaries race before Biden picked her as his running mate.</p>

<p>If Harris, 59, manages to beat Donald Trump in November, she will become the first woman and the second Black person, after Barack Obama, to run the world's leading power.</p>

<h3><strong>Trailblazer&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>In so many ways, Harris already is a trailblazer. Born to an Indian mother and a Jamaican father, she was the first woman attorney general ever elected in California, on top of being the first African American and Asian American to hold that post. She then became the first vice president in US history in those same categories.</p>

<p>In a survey published in September 2023, the Pew Research Center, a Washington-based think tank, found that for a majority of Americans, gender does not play a role in choosing a president.</p>

<p>Sixty per cent of respondents said that a female president would handle pressure as well as a man, while 27 per cent believed that she would do better.</p>

<p>"While female leadership -- whether as presidents, queens, prime ministers, and heads of state -- has become the norm in many parts of the world, including Europe, Asia, South America, and African nations, the United States has yet to experience this moment," said Sonia Gipson Rankin, a law professor at the University of New Mexico.</p>

<p>She noted that even though Democrat Hillary Clinton lost the electoral college and therefore the presidency to Trump in 2016, she won the popular vote.</p>

<h3><strong>Strategic discrimination&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Regina Bateson, a professor of political science at the University of Colorado Boulder, believes that voters' biases may not themselves be the issue.</p>

<p>"The problem is often not that voters are actually biased," Bateson said. "It's that party insiders and delegates and political donors worry that the voters will be biased."</p>

<p>That leads them to withhold support from a woman of colour, a phenomenon that Bateson calls "strategic discrimination," which usually manifests itself during the primaries when a candidate must demonstrate that he or she is able to rally many groups of voters.</p>

<p>Harris, however, took over from Biden after the 81-year-old leader withdrew from the race, thus sparing her "this process of trying to convince people that she's electable" during the primaries.</p>

<p>Flanked by her running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, a 60-year-old white man, Harris now hopes to win the trust of all Americans, regardless of ethnicity or gender.</p>

<p>Some are already convinced such as "White dudes for Harris," a group that brought nearly 200,000 people together for a Zoom fundraiser for Harris in late July, raising more than $4 million.</p>

<p>Donald Trump didn't wait long to attack his Democratic rival on her background.</p>

<p>The billionaire charged that Harris "turned Black" only recently in order to win electoral support.</p>

<p>Harris, who had always spoken of her Black and Asian heritage with pride, called out Trump for his "divisiveness and disrespect."</p>

<p>The former president's running mate, J.D. Vance, caused an outcry recently when a 2021 video resurfaced in which he dismisses the Democratic Party as being run by "a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives... and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable too."</p>

<p>Harris is married to Douglas Emhoff and helped in raising his two children from a previous marriage. She does not have any biological children of her own.</p>

<p>Vance's comments caused a backlash amplified by Hollywood stars such as Jennifer Aniston and Glenn Close, and were widely considered a political misstep in a country where the fertility rate is historically low.</p>

<p>Vance has sought to walk back his remarks saying they were taken out of context.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For the first time, the UK government is planning to treat extreme misogyny as a form of terrorism, the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2024/08/17/extreme-misogyny-treated-as-terrorism-government/">Telegraph </a>reported.</p>

<p>To tackle growing incidents of violence against women and girls, UK home secretary Yvette Cooper has ordered a review of the counter-terrorism strategy which will help identify gaps in current laws and also study emerging ideologies especially online misogynistic discourse.</p>

<p>This move will look at violence against women in the same way as far-right extremism.</p>

<p>Under the suggested legislation, it would be mandatory for school teachers to refer students they suspect of extreme misogyny to the government's counter-terror programme.</p>

<p>Anyone who is referred to the programme is assessed by local police to see if they show signs of radicalistaion and need to be deradicalised.</p>

<p>This comes after reports warned that misogynistic influencers like Andrew Tate are radicalising teenage boys online in the same way terrorist draw in their followers.</p>

<p>Last year, counter-extremism workers warned of a rise in the number of cases being referred to them by schools concerned about the his influence. The reports included incidents of verbal harassment of female teachers or other students which reflected the influencer's views.</p>

<p>The UK Home Ministry has several extremism categories marked as areas of "concern" and this includes a category for "incel" - an abbreviation of the term "involuntary celibate" - which refers to a misogynistic view that blames women for men's failure to get sexual opportunities.</p>

<p>UK officials now fear that this category does not capture other forms of extreme misogyny.</p>

<p>"For too long, governments have failed to address the rise in extremism, both online and on our streets, and we've seen the number of young people radicalised online grow. Hateful incitement of all kinds fractures and frays the very fabric of our communities and our democracy," Ms Cooper told the Telegraph.</p>

<p>Last month, UK's National Police Chiefs' Council published a report on violence against women and girls labelling it as a national emergency.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A senior Hamas official on Saturday dismissed optimistic talk by US President Joe Biden that a Gaza truce is nearer after negotiations in the Gulf emirate of Qatar.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A senior Hamas official on Saturday dismissed optimistic talk by US President Joe Biden that a Gaza truce is nearer after negotiations in the Gulf emirate of Qatar.</p>

<p>"To say that we are getting close to a deal is an illusion," Hamas political bureau member Sami Abu Zuhri told AFP. "We are not facing a deal or real negotiations, but rather the imposing of American diktats."</p>

<p>He was responding to Biden's comment Friday that "We are closer than we have ever been."</p>

<p>Biden spoke after two days of talks in Qatar where Washington tried to bridge differences between Israel and Palestinian group Hamas which have been at war for more than 10 months in the Gaza Strip.</p>

<p>Previous optimism during months of on-off truce talks has proven unfounded.</p>

<p>But the stakes have risen significantly since the late July killings in quick succession of Fuad Shukr, a top operations chief of Lebanon's Iran-backed Hezbollah movement, and Hamas political chief Ismail Haniyeh.</p>

<p>Their deaths prompted promises of retaliation from Iran and Hezbollah and fears of a wider Middle East war.</p>

<p>Trying to avert a broader conflict, Western and Arab diplomats have been shuttling around the region to push for a Gaza deal which they say could help avert a wider conflagration.</p>

<p>US Secretary of State Antony Blinken is headed back to the region this weekend in a bid to help seal a deal.</p>

<p>Hamas officials have objected to "new conditions" from Israel in the latest proposal drawn up by Washington.</p>

<p>Israel's delegation expressed "cautious optimism" about the prospects for an agreement after returning from Doha, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said Saturday.</p>

<p>"There is hope that the heavy pressure on Hamas from the United States and mediators will lead to the removal of their opposition to the American proposal, potentially allowing a breakthrough in the negotiations," it said.</p>

<p>In a joint statement, the foreign ministers of Britain, France, Germany and Italy urged all parties to "engage positively and flexibly" in the negotiations.</p>

<p>"We underline the importance of avoiding any escalatory action in the region which would undermine the prospect for peace," they added.</p>

<p>"There is too much at stake."</p>

<h3><strong>Strikes in Lebanon, Gaza</strong></h3>

<p>As efforts towards a truce continued, so did the killing in Gaza and Lebanon.</p>

<p>Lebanon's health ministry said an Israeli air strike in the southern Nabatieh area killed 10 Syrians, including a woman and her two children.</p>

<p>The strike was among the deadliest in south Lebanon since the onset of near-daily exchanges of fire between Israel and Hezbollah following the start of the Gaza war.</p>

<p>Israel's military said it struck a Hezbollah weapons storage facility.</p>

<p>In Hamas-run Gaza, the civil defence authority said an Israeli air strike killed 15 people from a single Palestinian family. The deaths in Al-Zawaida helped push the Gaza health ministry's war death count to 40,074.</p>

<p>"We are in the morgue seeing indescribable scenes of limbs and severed heads and children who are dismembered," said Omar al-Dreemli, a relative.</p>

<p>Israel's military told AFP that overnight its forces had struck "terrorist infrastructure" in central Gaza from which rockets were being fired.</p>

<p>"Reports were received that as a result of the strike, civilians in an adjacent structure were killed. The incident is under review," it said.</p>

<p>The war has destroyed much of Gaza's housing and healthcare infrastructure, leaving children vulnerable to preventable diseases.</p>

<p>The United Nations appealed Friday for seven-day pauses in the fighting so it could vaccinate children against polio, as the Palestinian health ministry reported Gaza's first polio case in 25 years.</p>

<h3><strong>'Bring them home'</strong></h3>

<p>Hamas's unprecedented October 7 attack on Israel that triggered the war resulted in the deaths of 1,198 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures.</p>

<p>Hamas also seized 251 hostages, 111 of whom are still held in Gaza, including 39 the military says are dead. More than 100 were freed during a one-week truce in November.</p>

<p>The Israeli military says 332 soldiers have been killed in the Gaza campaign since the ground offensive began on October 27.</p>

<p>In Israel, Blinken will seek to "conclude the agreement for a ceasefire and release of hostages and detainees", the State Department said.</p>

<p>Egyptian, Qatari and US mediators are working to finalise details of a framework agreement initially outlined by Biden in May. He said Israel had proposed it.</p>

<p>Thousands rallied in Tel Aviv and other Israeli cities on Saturday demanding a deal that would bring home the remaining Gaza hostages.</p>

<p>"We all know there's a real possibility for a deal," said Mor Korngold, hostage Tal Shoham's brother.</p>

<p>"These are crucial hours for my brother, for the hostages, for the soldiers, for those displaced from their homes, for the entire country."</p>

<p>In a joint statement after two days of talks in Qatar, the mediators said they would meet in Cairo "before the end of next week", hoping to seal an agreement.</p>

<h3><strong>Gazans on the move again</strong></h3>

<p>As truce talks took place, thousands of civilians were on the move again after the Israeli military issued fresh evacuation orders ahead of imminent action in central-southern Gaza.</p>

<p>"During each round of negotiations, they exert pressure by forcing evacuations and committing massacres," said Issa Murad, a Palestinian displaced to Deir el-Balah.</p>

<p>Over the past day, troops expanded operations around Gaza's main southern city of Khan Yunis including by "eliminating" Hamas who had fired munitions toward Nirim, just outside Gaza, Israel's military said Saturday.</p>

<p>Witnesses told AFP air strikes hit the Hamad residential towers in the city's northwest.</p>

<p>In the occupied West Bank, Palestinian officials said two people were killed in an Israeli air strike on a car in the northern city of Jenin that Israel's military said targeted a "terrorist cell".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Palestinian officials said two people were killed in an Israeli air strike in the occupied West Bank on Saturday that the Israeli military said targeted a "terrorist cell" in the Jenin area.</p>

<p>"Two bodies were transferred to Jenin public hospital after the occupiers (Israeli forces) bombed a car in the centre of the city," the Palestinian health ministry said in a statement.</p>

<p>The official Palestinian news agency Wafa reported that the strike was carried out by an "Israeli drone".</p>

<p>The military said in a statement that it had carried out an "air strike on a terrorist cell in the Jenin area".</p>

<p>Video footage posted online showed a vehicle on fire in the middle of a street, while some images showed a crowd around a charred car, trying to open the doors.</p>

<p>"There are dead people in the car," shouts a man as a stretcher is brought by rescue workers.</p>

<p>Since Hamas's unprecedented attack on Israel on October 7, violence has flared in the West Bank, a Palestinian territory occupied by Israel since 1967 and separated geographically from Gaza by Israeli territory.</p>

<p>Since October 7, at least 635 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank by Israeli troops or settlers, according to an AFP count based on Palestinian official figures.</p>

<p>During the same period, at least 18 Israelis, including soldiers, have been killed in Palestinian attacks, according to Israeli official figures.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A magnitude 7.0 earthquake struck off the coast of Russia's far-eastern Kamchatka Peninsula early Sunday morning local time, according to the regional earthquake monitoring service.</p>

<p>The local emergencies ministry said tremors were felt along the coast including in the region's capital Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky.</p>

<p>"Operational teams of rescuers and firefighters are inspecting buildings," the regional branch of Russia's emergencies ministry in the Kamchatka region said on Telegram.</p>

<p>The earthquake struck at a depth of nearly 50 kilometres (30 miles) just after 7:00 am local time, some 90 kilometres east of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, the United States Geological Survey reported.</p>

<p>The US National Tsunami Warning Center had initially issued a tsunami threat, but later said the threat had passed. Local authorities never issued a tsunami alert.</p>

<p>Several aftershocks were recorded after the initial quake, but of lower intensity, the Kamchatka branch of Russia's Unified Geophysical Service reported on its website.</p>

<p>The peninsula lies on a seismically active belt surrounding most of the Pacific Ocean known as the "Ring of Fire", and is home to more than two dozen active volcanoes.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gaza has recorded its first polio case in 25 years, the Palestinian health ministry said on Friday, after UN chief Antonio Guterres called for pauses in the Israel-Hamas war to vaccinate hundreds of thousands of children.</p>

<p>Tests in Jordan confirmed the disease in an unvaccinated 10-month-old from the central Gaza Strip, the health ministry in Ramallah said.</p>

<p>According to the United Nations, Gaza, now in its 11th month of war, has not registered a polio case for 25 years, although type 2 poliovirus was detected in samples collected from the territory's wastewater in June.</p>

<p>"Doctors suspected the presence of symptoms consistent with polio," the health ministry said. "After conducting the necessary tests in the Jordanian capital, Amman, the infection was confirmed."</p>

<p>The case emerged shortly after Guterres called for two seven-day breaks in the Gaza war to vaccinate more than 640,000 children.</p>

<p>Poliovirus, most often spread through sewage and contaminated water, is highly infectious. It can cause deformities and paralysis and is potentially fatal. It mainly affects children under the age of five.</p>

<p>The UN health and children's agencies said they had made detailed plans to reach children across the besieged Palestinian territory and could start this month.</p>

<p>But that would require pauses in the 10-month old war between Israel and Hamas, they said.</p>

<p>"Preventing and containing the spread of polio will take a massive, coordinated and urgent effort," Guterres told reporters at UN headquarters in New York.</p>

<p>"I am appealing to all parties to provide concrete assurances right away guaranteeing humanitarian pauses for the campaign."</p>

<p>The World Health Organization and UN children's fund UNICEF said they were planning two seven-day vaccination drives across the Gaza Strip, starting in late August, against type 2 poliovirus (cVDPV2).</p>

<p>Last month, it was announced that type 2 poliovirus had been detected in samples collected in Gaza on June 23.</p>

<p>"These pauses in fighting would allow children and families to safely reach health facilities and community outreach workers to get to children who cannot access health facilities for polio vaccination," the agencies said in a statement said.</p>

<h3><strong>Regional public health issue</strong></h3>

<p>After 25 years without polio, its re-emergence in the Gaza Strip would threaten neighbouring countries, it added.</p>

<p>"A ceasefire is the only way to ensure public health security in the Gaza Strip and the region."</p>

<p>During each round of the campaign, the health ministry in Gaza, alongside UN agencies, would provide "two drops of novel oral polio vaccine type 2 (nOPV2) to more than 640,000 children under 10 years of age".</p>

<p>More than 1.6 million doses of nOPV2 were expected to transit through Israel's Ben Gurion Airport "by the end of August", the statement added.</p>

<p>The war was triggered by Hamas's unprecedented October 7 attack on Israel which resulted in the deaths of 1,198 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures.</p>

<p>On Thursday, the toll from Israel's retaliatory military campaign in Gaza passed 40,000, according to the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza, which does not provide a breakdown of civilian and Hamas casualties.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The UN's nuclear watchdog warned on Saturday that the safety situation at Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant was "deteriorating" following a nearby drone strike.</p>

<p>Earlier on Saturday, Russia accused Ukraine of dropping an explosive charge on a road near the occupied plant in southern Ukraine.</p>

<p>The plant, which was seized by Russia's forces early in the war, has come under repeated attacks that both sides have accused each other of carrying out.</p>

<p>International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) experts on site were informed of the detonation near essential plant facilities on Saturday and immediately visited the area, the agency said in a statement.</p>

<p>They reported that the damage "seemed to have been caused by a drone equipped with an explosive payload," impacting the road between the plant's two main gates.</p>

<p>"Yet again we see an escalation of the nuclear safety and security dangers facing the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant," IAEA head Rafael Grossi said in the statement.</p>

<p>"I remain extremely concerned and reiterate my call for maximum restraint from all sides," he said.</p>

<p>The "nuclear safety situation" at the plant was "deteriorating," the statement added.</p>

<p>The IAEA team on site reported "intense" military activity over the past week in the area, including very close to the plant, it added.</p>

<p>"The team has heard frequent explosions, repetitive heavy machine gun and rifle fire and artillery at various distances from the plant," it said.</p>

<p>Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the IAEA has repeatedly urged restraint, saying it fears reckless military action could trigger a major nuclear accident at the plant.</p>

<p>Kyiv and Moscow traded blame last weekend after a fire broke out at a cooling tower at the plant.</p>

<p>IAEA experts were able to visit the base of the cooling tower but have requested further access to assess the situation, according to the Vienna-based IAEA.</p>

<p>The fire resulted in "considerable damage", but there was no immediate threat to nuclear safety, the agency said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Republican Donald Trump said on Saturday he believed Democrat Kamala Harris will be easier to beat than President Joe Biden even as some polls showed her edging ahead in the race for the Nov. 5 presidential election.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said on Saturday he believed Democrat Kamala Harris will be easier to beat than President Joe Biden even as some polls showed her edging ahead in the race for the Nov. 5 presidential election.</p>

<p>Trump, the former president, spoke at a rally in Wilkes-Barre in northeastern Pennsylvania, a state looming large in the campaign. Vice President Harris will conduct a bus tour of western Pennsylvania starting in Pittsburgh on Sunday, ahead of the kickoff of the Democratic National Convention on Monday in Chicago.</p>

<p>"I believe she will be easier to beat than him," said Trump, referring to her as "radical" and a "lunatic."</p>

<p>Trump has sought to portray Harris as far left on a number of policies. At the rally, he highlighted her previous call for a ban on fracking, an industry important to the state. Harris' campaign has recently indicated she would not support a ban.</p>

<p>He also continued to attack Harris on personal terms, even as some political analysts say such comments could hurt Trump with moderate voters.</p>

<p>"Have you heard her laugh? That is the laugh of a crazy person," Trump said, adding that he was displeased by the illustration of Harris on the cover of the latest issue of Time magazine. "I'm much better looking than her."</p>

<p>In a meandering speech, Trump repeated his false claim that he lost the 2020 election due to fraud, dismissed the threat of climate change and said his plan to impose across-the-board tariffs on foreign goods would not act as a tax on U.S. consumers, an assertion that most economists contest.</p>

<p>The Mohegan Sun Arena, where Trump appeared, has a capacity of roughly 8,000 and was nearly full when he started speaking. But the crowd began to thin after the one-hour mark. He spoke for more than 100 minutes in total.</p>

<p>Pennsylvania was one of three Rust Belt states, along with Wisconsin and Michigan, that helped power Trump's upset victory in 2016. Biden, who grew up in Scranton, Pennsylvania, flipped the trio back to the Democrats in 2020.</p>

<p>With 19 electoral votes out of the 270 needed to secure the White House, compared with 15 in Michigan and 10 in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania may be the biggest prize in this year's election and potentially tip the balance for either candidate.</p>

<p>Harris' entry into the race after Biden ended his reelection bid last month has upended the contest, erasing the lead Trump built in the final weeks of Biden's campaign. Harris is leading Trump by more than two percentage points in Pennsylvania, according to the poll tracking website FiveThirtyEight.</p>

<h3><strong>BLANKETING AIRWAVES WITH ADS</strong></h3>

<p>Trump won Pennsylvania in 2016 by about 44,000 votes, a margin of less than one percentage point, while Biden prevailed by just over 80,000 votes in 2020, a 1.2-point margin.</p>

<p>Both campaigns have made the state a top priority, blanketing the airwaves with advertisements. Of the more than $110 million spent on advertising in seven battleground states since Biden dropped out in late July, roughly $42 million was in Pennsylvania, more than twice any other state, the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday, citing data from the tracking site AdImpact.</p>

<p>Democratic and Republican groups have already reserved $114 million in ad time in Pennsylvania from late August through the election, more than twice as much as the $55 million reserved in Arizona, the next highest total, according to AdImpact.</p>

<p>The Harris campaign said on Saturday it planned to spend at least $370 million on digital and television ads nationwide between the Labor Day holiday on Sept. 2 and Election Day.</p>

<p>The battleground states - seen as critical for winning the election - also include Arizona, North Carolina, Nevada and Georgia.</p>

<p>New polls published on Saturday by the New York Times found Harris leading Trump among likely voters in Arizona, 50% to 45%, and in North Carolina, 49% to 47%, and narrowing the former president's leads in Nevada, 47% to 49%, and in Georgia, 46% to 50%. A pollster from the Trump campaign said the poll results underestimated the Republican candidate's support.</p>

<p>Trump will give remarks on the economy at a campaign event in York, Pennsylvania, on Monday. His running mate, U.S. Senator JD Vance, will hold an event in Philadelphia that day as well.</p>

<p>Trump's trip to Wilkes-Barre in Luzerne County was aimed at solidifying support among the white, non-college-educated voters who lifted him to victory in 2016. The blue-collar county voted Democratic for decades before swinging heavily toward Trump in 2016, mirroring other similar regions around the country.</p>

<p>Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, will make multiple stops across Allegheny and Beaver counties on Sunday, the campaign said. The tour is the first time Harris, Walz and their spouses have campaigned together since their first rally as a presidential ticket in Philadelphia earlier this month.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Germany, the second largest contributor of aid to Ukraine, plans to halve its military aid to Kyiv in 2025, a parliamentary source told AFP Saturday.</p>

<p>Instead, the government of Olaf Scholz will bank on money generated from frozen Russian assets to continue supporting Kyiv, and is not planning "additional aid" to the 4 billion euros ($4.4 billion) set aside in next year's budget.</p>

<p>This year, aid from Berlin amounted to 8 billion euros.</p>

<p>To compensate, Germany is counting on "the creation, within the framework of the G7 and the European Union, of a financial instrument using frozen Russian assets, said a separate source from inside the ministry of finance.</p>

<p>German daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung said in its weekend edition that the move was part of an agreement between the chancellor, the Social Democratic party (SPD) and Finance Minister Christian Lindner.</p>

<p>Lindner is a member of junior coalition partner the Liberal party.</p>

<p>Ukraine's ambassador to Germany Oleksii Makeiev said in a posting on X, formerly Twitter, that "the security of Europe depends on Germany's political will to continue to play a frontline role in supporting Ukraine".</p>

<p>The 2025 budget has been the subject of fierce discussions between the government coalition of Liberals, the Greens and the Social Democrats.</p>

<p>Lindner has asked other ministries to make savings in order to respect a constitutional rule that aims to prevent the state from taking on too much debt.</p>

<p>However the budget is still subject to discussions before being adopted by the end of the year. The finance ministry said Saturday it was open to considering extra spending for Ukraine on a case-by-case basis.</p>

<p>Ukraine's allies have been working for several months on a mechanism to allow part of the $300 billion of Russian assets frozen worldwide to be used to support Kyiv in its war with Moscow.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p>

<p>Firefighters were battling a strong forest fire in Turkey's Aegean city of Izmir for a third day on Saturday, AFP reporters said, a day after hundreds of local people in nearby villages had to be evacuated.</p>

<p>Firefighters said they had partially beaten back the flames that have been threatening the port city over the last three days, although fires were still burning in the nearby forests.</p>

<p>In the northern suburb of Ornekkoy, AFP journalists saw the charred remains of several buildings and vehicles in an industrial zone while grey smoke billowed into the sky.</p>

<p>"We don't know what to do. Our workplace is located in the middle of the fire. We have lost our livelihood," said 48-year-old Hanife Erbil, who earns a living collecting paper and plastic waste.</p>

<p>The pine trees that once crowned the surrounding hills were also burned.</p>

<p>"It was such a beautiful route, it smelled of pine trees everywhere. It makes me want to cry," said taxi driver Ayhan.</p>

<p>The smell of smoke was hanging over the city, the third most-populated in Turkey.</p>

<p>Firefighters from other Turkish cities have been sent as reinforcements and the army has been mobilised.</p>

<p>"Everyone is working hard. I'm on my 36th hour of service. We can say the fire is partially under control," said Izmir firefighter Arjin Erol.</p>

<h3><strong>Evacuations</strong></h3>

<p>The fire started on Thursday and spread quickly to residential areas by winds blowing at 50 kilometres (30 miles) an hour.</p>

<p>Turkish Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said 900 residents in five affected districts had been evacuated Friday night in Izmir.</p>

<p>On Saturday, those villages remained empty for security reasons, except for a handful of volunteers who left food and water for animals living in the forest, AFP journalists saw.</p>

<p>Wild animals, cats and dogs died in the fire but no human victim has yet been reported.</p>

<p>The fire damaged 16 buildings and affected 78 people, with 29 of them admitted to hospital, the Turkish health ministry said.</p>

<p>"Currently, two planes and eleven helicopters are continuing to intervene," said Agriculture and Forestry Ministry Ibrahim Yumakli, after the strong winds had earlier grounded the helicopters and water bombers.</p>

<p>Residents of the city should not be worried, he added.</p>

<p>Four helicopters were dropping water on the flames throughout the day, backed by two planes, AFP journalists witnessed.</p>

<p>Around 1,600 hectares (3,900 acres) have been affected, the minister said, adding that the challenging terrain was making it difficult to put out the fire at its origin.</p>

<h3><strong>Fresh flames</strong></h3>

<p>Five other fires continue to rage in forest areas in other cities in Turkey, including northwestern Bolu and Aydin in the west.</p>

<p>And new fires broke out again in Izmir late on Saturday engulfing several districts including Bayindir and the popular holiday resort of Cesme, local mayor Cemil Tugay said on social media.</p>

<p>The authorities have controlled the fire in Cesme that lies across the Greek island of Chios, he said.</p>

<p>Officials said seven people were detained in Izmir over alleged links to the fire.</p>

<p>To come to the aid of its regional ally, Azerbaijan has sent a water bomber plane, the Turkish presidency announced.</p>

<p>Scientists say climate change makes extreme weather events including heatwaves more likely, longer lasting and more intense, increasing the risk of wildfires.</p>

<p>In June, a fire that broke out in Mardin in southeastern Turkey claimed the lives of 15 people.</p>

<p>Observers however say Turkey has made progress since it was hit by the worst fires in its history in 2021.</p>

<p>At the time President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's government was criticised for its failure to mobilise due to a lack of planes and helicopters.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Media platform X said on Saturday it would close its operations in Brazil "effective immediately" due to what it called "censorship orders" from Brazilian judge Alexandre de Moraes.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">The decision to close the ? office in Brazil was difficult, but, if we had agreed to <a href="https://twitter.com/alexandre?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@alexandre</a>'s (illegal) secret censorship and private information handover demands, there was no way we could explain our actions without being ashamed.</p>

<p>X claims Alexandre Moraes secretly threatened one of its legal representatives in the South American country with arrest if it did not comply with legal orders to take down some content from its platform. Brazil's Supreme Court, where Alexandre Moraes has a seat, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>

<p>The X service remains available to the people of Brazil, billionaire Elon Musk's platform said on Saturday.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, Alexandre Moraes ordered X to block certain accounts, as he investigates so-called "digital militias" that have been accused of spreading fake news and hate messages during the government of far-right former President Jair Bolsonaro.</p>

<p>Alexandre Moraes opened an inquiry earlier this year into the billionaire after Musk said he would reactivate accounts on X that the judge had ordered blocked. Musk has called the Alexandre Moraes' decisions regarding X "unconstitutional."</p>

<p>After Musk's challenges, X representatives reversed course and told Brazil's Supreme Court that the social media giant would comply with the legal rulings.</p>

<p>Lawyers representing X in Brazil in April told the Supreme Court that "operational faults" have allowed users who were ordered blocked to stay active on the social media platform, after Alexandre Moraes had asked X to explain why it allegedly had not fully complied with his decisions.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Saturday his forces were "strengthening" their positions in Russia's Kursk region, where Kyiv has been mounting a major ground offensive for more than 11 days.</p>

<p>His comments came a day after Moscow accused Ukraine of destroying a key bridge over a river in the border region, as Kyiv seeks to disrupt supply routes and the movement of Moscow's troops in the area.</p>

<p>Ukrainian army chief Oleksandr Syrsky "reported on the strengthening of the positions of our forces in the Kursk region and the expansion of stabilised territory", Zelensky said in a post on Telegram.</p>

<p>"As of this morning, we have replenished the exchange fund for our country," Zelensky said, referring to Russian soldiers Ukraine has captured to be used in future prisoner swaps.</p>

<p>"I thank all the soldiers and commanders who are taking Russian soldiers prisoner and thus bringing the release of our soldiers and civilians held by Russia closer," Zelensky said.</p>

<p>Kyiv claims to have taken control of more than 80 settlements in the lightning incursion, which caught the Kremlin off guard almost two and a half years into its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.</p>

<p>The Russian defence ministry said on Saturday it had pushed back Ukrainian forces near three settlements in the Kursk region, and was searching for "mobile enemy groups" trying to pierce deeper into the country.</p>

<p><strong>Bridge 'completely destroyed'</strong></p>

<p>Russian officials on Friday accused Ukraine of striking a strategically important bridge just a couple dozen kilometres away from fighting in the Kursk region.</p>

<p>The region's governor, Alexei Smirnov, said on Friday evening the bridge was in the Glushkovsky district, some 11 kilometres (seven miles) away from the border.</p>

<p>An aerial video published by Ukrainian air force commander Mykola Oleshchuk appeared to show the bridge being hit by a projectile at high speed before collapsing in a cloud of smoke.</p>

<p>"Ukrainian pilots are conducting precision strikes on enemy strongholds, equipment concentrations, as well as on enemy logistics centres and supply routes," he said on Telegram.</p>

<p>Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said the bridge was "completely destroyed" and that "volunteers providing assistance to the evacuated civilian population were killed".</p>

<p>"All those responsible for these inhumane acts will be severely punished," she said.</p>

<p>Russia separately accused Ukraine on Saturday of dropping an explosive charge on a road near the occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine.</p>

<p>The plant, which was seized by Russia's forces early in the war, has come under repeated attacks that both sides have accused each other of carrying out.</p>

<p>Russia meanwhile attacked at least four Ukrainian regions on Saturday, according to officials, including the northeastern region of Kharkiv, where prosecutors said shelling killed a 49-year-old woman.</p>

<p><strong>'Under control'</strong></p>

<p>While the incursion has delivered a major morale boost to Kyiv, it appears to have had little impact on the larger battles raging in Russian-occupied parts of eastern Ukraine.</p>

<p>Zelensky said on Saturday there had been "dozens of Russian assaults" on Ukrainian positions near the towns of Pokrovsk and Toretsk, where Moscow has made a string of advances in recent weeks.</p>

<p>"Our soldiers and units are doing everything to destroy the occupier and repel the attacks," Zelensky said, stressing the situation was "under control".</p>

<p>Russia said Friday its forces had captured another village near Pokrovsk, a Ukrainian-held logistics hub that lies on a road supplying troops and towns across the eastern front.</p>

<p>Russian forces have been inching towards the town for months, taking a string of tiny villages over the past weeks.</p>

<p>The head of Pokrovsk's military administration, Sergiy Dobryak, warned on Thursday that Russia was a little over 10 kilometres from the outskirts of the city and urged remaining residents to evacuate.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>During the past month, Israeli combat engineers have destroyed approximately 50 Hamas tunnel routes in the area of the Egypt-Gaza border, the Israel Defense Forces said on Thursday. The announcement came as Israeli and Arab leaders were due to resume ceasefire negotiations in Qatar.</p>

<p>The tunnels were all in the Philadelphi corridor, a buffer zone that runs the length of the 14-km Gaza-Egypt border. It was created in 2006 to prevent weapons smuggling after Israel disengaged from the Strip. Hamas violently seized control of Gaza from the Palestinian Authority the following year.</p>

<p>The military did not specify if any of the tunnels crossed into the Egyptian Sinai. On August 4, soldiers from the IDF's elite Yahalom combat engineering unit destroyed a three-meter tall smuggling tunnel leading into Egypt that was large enough to drive vehicles through.</p>

<p>Securing the Philadelphi corridor and destroying smuggling tunnels there is a critical goal to prevent Hamas from rearming and to curtail its leaders from escaping into the Sinai with Israeli hostages.</p>

<p>At least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas's attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 111 remaining hostages, 39 have been declared dead. Hamas has also been holding captive two Israeli civilians since 2014 and 2015, and the bodies of two soldiers killed in 2014.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

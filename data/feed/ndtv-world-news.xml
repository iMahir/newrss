       <description><![CDATA[The Missouri teen plummeted to his death after slipping out of the seat on the 400 ft-tall ride at Orlando's ICON Park in 2022.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A jury in the US state of Florida has awarded $310 million (Rs 2,624 crore) to the family of a teenager who was killed after falling off a Free Fall Tower drop ride at Orlando's ICON Park in 2022. Tyre Sampson was only 14 years old when he plummeted 70 feet from the ride at the amusement park that he was visiting on a spring break trip with his football team. The kid's parents, Nekia Dodd and Yarnell Sampson, will each be receiving $155 million (Rs 1,312 crore) from Funtime, the ride's manufacturer, that has been held responsible for the deadly incident.</p>

<p>"This verdict is a step forward in holding corporations accountable for the safety of their products. The jury's decision confirms what we have long argued: Tyre's death was the result of blatant negligence and a failure to prioritize safety over profits," read a statement by attorneys representing Tyre's parents.</p>

<p>"The ride's manufacturers neglected their duty to protect passengers, and today's outcome ensures they face the consequences of those decisions."</p>

<p>The trial only lasted a day as Funtime failed to appear in the court to defend itself. The family had already reached an undisclosed settlement with ICON Park. It now faces the challenge of pursuing the $310 million damages from Funtime, which is based in Austria and will need to seek a court order from an Austrian court to collect.</p>

<h3><strong>How did Tyre Sampson fall to death?</strong></h3>

<p>The Missouri teen plummeted to his death after slipping out of the seat on the 400 ft-tall ride. The Free Fall ride which placed 30 riders in seats attached to a tower, secured the passengers with a shoulder harness and then dropped them 430 feet. Surprisingly, it did not have seat belts, something which most drop rides have as an additional safety measure.</p>

<p>Mr Sampson also weighed 173 kilograms, which exceeded the ride's 129-kilogram weight limit but was still allowed to sit on the ride. Due to his size, the harness did not lock properly and he was ejected from the seat when the ride braked at height.</p>

<p>The ride has since been disassembled with Florida Governor, Ron DeSantis greenlighting the Tyre Sampson Act in May 2023 which aims to bolster safety requirements for amusement park attractions. The family has also demanded an industry-wide revamp to implement "stricter safety measures and oversight" to prevent such tragedies from happening again.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Syrian government forces have lost control of Daraa city, a war monitor said, in another stunning blow for President Bashar al-Assad's rule after rebels wrested other key cities from his grip.</p>

<p>Daraa was dubbed "the cradle of the revolution" early in Syria's civil war, after activists accused the government of detaining and torturing a group of boys for scribbling anti-Assad graffiti on their school walls in 2011.</p>

<p>While Aleppo and Hama, the two other main cities taken from government control in recent days, fell to an Islamist-led rebel alliance, Daraa fell to local armed groups, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.</p>

<p>"Local factions have taken control of more areas in Daraa province, including Daraa city... they now control more than 90 percent of the province, as regime forces successively pulled out," the Britain-based Observatory said late Friday, which relies on a network of sources around Syria.</p>

<p>Daraa province borders Jordan.</p>

<p>Despite a truce brokered by Assad ally Russia, it has been plagued by unrest in recent years, with frequent attacks, clashes and assassinations.</p>

<p>- Waves of violence -</p>

<p>Syria's civil war, which began with Assad's crackdown on democracy protests, has killed more than 500,000 people and forced more than half the population to flee their homes.</p>

<p>Never in the war had Assad's forces lost control of so many key cities in such a short space of time.</p>

<p>Since a rebel alliance led by the Islamist Hayat Tahrir al-Sham launched its offensive on November 27, the government has lost second city Aleppo and subsequently Hama in central Syria.</p>

<p>The rebels were on Friday at the gates of Homs, Syria's third city, as the government pulled out its troops from Deir Ezzor in the east to redeploy towards to the centre.</p>

<p>In an interview published on Friday, the leader of HTS, Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, said the aim of the offensive was to overthrow Assad.</p>

<p>"When we talk about objectives, the goal of the revolution remains the overthrow of this regime. It is our right to use all available means to achieve that goal," Jolani told CNN.</p>

<p>HTS is rooted in the Syrian branch of Al-Qaeda. Proscribed as a terrorist organisation by Western governments, it has sought to soften its image in recent years.</p>

<p>According to Fabrice Balanche, a lecturer at France's Lumiere Lyon 2 university, HTS now controls 20,000 square kilometres (more than 7,700 square miles) of territory, nearly seven times as much as it did before the offensive started.</p>

<p><strong>- Sudden withdrawal -</strong></p>

<p>As the army and its Iran-backed militia allies pulled out of Deir Ezzor in eastern Syria, Kurdish-led forces said they crossed the Euphrates and took control of the territory that had been vacated.</p>

<p>The Observatory said government troops and their allies withdrew "suddenly" from the east and headed towards the oasis town of Palmyra on the desert road to Homs.</p>

<p>The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, who are backed by the United States, expressed readiness for dialogue with both Turkey and the rebels, saying the offensive heralded a "new" political reality for Syria.</p>

<p>The rebels launched their offensive the same day a ceasefire took effect in neighbouring Lebanon in the war between Israel and Hezbollah.</p>

<p>The Lebanese militant group has been an important Assad ally, alongside Russia and Iran.</p>

<p>Turkey, which has backed the opposition, said it would hold talks with Russia and Iran in Qatar this weekend.</p>

<p>Ahead of the talks, the top diplomats of Iran, Iraq and Syria met in Baghdad, where Syria's Bassam al-Sabbagh accused the government's enemies of seeking to "redraw the political map".</p>

<p>Iran's Abbas Araghchi pledged to provide Assad's government with "whatever (support) is needed".</p>

<p><strong>- Fear -</strong></p>

<p>In Homs, scene of some of the war's deadliest violence, tens of thousands of members of Assad's Alawite minority were fleeing, fearing the rebels' advance, residents and the Britain-based Observatory said.</p>

<p>Syrians who were forced out of the country years ago by the initial crackdown on the revolt were glued to their phones as they watched current developments unfold.</p>

<p>"We've been dreaming of this for more than a decade," said Yazan, a 39-year-old former activist who now lives in France.</p>

<p>Asked whether he was worried about HTS's Islamist agenda, he said: "It doesn't matter to me who is conducting this. The devil himself could be behind it. What people care about is who is going to liberate the country."</p>

<p>On the other side of the sectarian divide, Haidar, 37, who lives in an Alawite-majority neighbourhood, told AFP by telephone that "fear is the umbrella that covers Homs now".</p>

<p>The army shelled the advancing rebels as Syrian and Russian aircraft struck from the skies. At least 20 civilians, including five children, were killed in the bombardment, the war monitor added.</p>

<p><strong>- 'Massive blow' -</strong></p>

<p>At least 826 people, mostly combatants but also including 111 civilians, have been killed since the offensive began last week, according to the Observatory's figures, while the United Nations said the violence has displaced 280,000 people.</p>

<p>Many of the scenes witnessed in recent days would have been unimaginable earlier in the war.</p>

<p>In Hama, an AFP photographer saw residents set fire to a giant poster of Assad on the facade of city hall.</p>

<p>"Our joy is indescribable, and we wish this for every honourable Syrian to experience these happy moments that we have been deprived of since birth," said Hama resident Ghiath Suleiman.</p>

<p>Online footage verified by AFP showed residents toppling a statue of Assad's father Hafez, under whose brutal rule the army carried out a massacre in the city in the 1980s.</p>

<p>Aron Lund, a fellow of the Century International think tank, called the loss of Hama "a massive, massive blow to the Syrian government".</p>

<p>Should Assad lose Homs, it wouldn't mean the end of his rule, Lund said, but "with no secure route from Damascus to the coast, I'd say it's over as a credible state entity".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol will address the nation on Saturday morning, his office said, ahead of a planned impeachment vote over his attempt this week to impose martial law.</p>

<p>The speech would be the embattled leader's first public appearance since he rescinded the martial law order early on Wednesday just six hours after it was declared, after parliament defied military and police cordons to vote against the decree.</p>

<p>On Friday the leader of Yoon's own People Power Party said the president was a danger to the country and needed to be removed from power, increasing the pressure on him to quit even though PPP members later reaffirmed its formal opposition to his impeachment.</p>

<p>Lawmakers will vote on the main opposition Democratic Party's motion to impeach Yoon, who shocked the nation late on Tuesday when he gave the military sweeping emergency powers in order to root out what he called "anti-state forces" and overcome obstructionist political opponents.</p>

<p>Some PPP members urged Yoon to resign before the vote, saying they did not want a repeat of the 2016 impeachment of then-President Park Geun-hye, who left office following months of candlelit protests over an influence-peddling scandal. Her downfall triggered the implosion of the party and a victory by liberals in presidential and general elections.</p>

<p>In scenes reminiscent of those protests, thousands of demonstrators holding candles assembled outside parliament on Friday night demanding Yoon's impeachment.</p>

<p>More demonstrations are expected on Saturday ahead of the vote.</p>

<p>Prosecutors, the police and the Corruption Investigation Office for High-ranking Officials have all launched probes into Yoon and senior officials involved in the martial law decree, seeking to pursue charges of insurrection and abuse of power, among others.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;More than 2,80,000 people have been uprooted in northwest Syria following the sudden and massive offensive into Government-controlled areas led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), which is sanctioned by the Security Council as a terrorist group, the United Nations said on Friday.</p>

<p>Sharing a post on X, the United Nations wrote, "Over 280,000 people have been uprooted in northwest Syria in a matter of days following the recent escalation of violence."</p>

<p>"Amid already dire living conditions after 13 years of war, the UN is scaling up humanitarian efforts to assist the most vulnerable," the post added.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, thousands of residents fled the city of Homs, desperate amid the rebels' advance towards Damascus sparked panic.</p>

<p>The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) said on Friday that thousands of Homs residents started fleeing overnight towards the western coast, where embattled Syrian President Bashar al-Assad still maintains control, according to a report by Al Jazeera.</p>

<p>Fighters led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) made significant gains in Syria, capturing two key towns - Rastan and Talbiseh - in the Homs governorate. According to Rami Abdel Rahman, head of the SOHR, HTS forces were just five kilometres away from the outskirts of Homs city.</p>

<p>After capturing the city of Hama to the north on Thursday, the rebels set their sights on the crossroads city of Homs which, if captured, would split the territories under the control of President Bashar al-Assad in two.</p>

<p>The conflict began in 2011 after Assad moved to stamp out peaceful pro-democracy protests during the Arab Spring. Over 3,00,000 civilians have been killed in more than a decade of war, according to the United Nations, with millions more displaced across the region, according to CNN.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>India on Friday announced that Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri will travel to Bangladesh on Monday, a visit that comes amid increasing strain in ties between New Delhi and Dhaka over attacks on minorities, including Hindus, in the neighbouring country.</p>

<p>It will be the first high-level visit from New Delhi to Dhaka after deposed prime minister Sheikh Hasina fled Bangladesh and took shelter in India following massive anti-government protests.</p>

<p>Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) Spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said Mr Misri will travel to Bangladesh to attend a meeting under the framework of Foreign Office Consultations.</p>

<p>In Dhaka, the foreign secretary will hold talks with his Bangladeshi counterpart, besides holding several other meetings, he said.</p>

<p>"The foreign secretary is scheduled to visit Bangladesh for Foreign Office Consultations on December 9. This is part of our structured interactions with the Bangladesh side," Mr Jaiswal said.</p>

<p>Mr Jaiswal was responding to a question at his weekly media briefing.</p>

<p>On the arrest of Hindu monk Chinmoy Krishna Das in Bangladesh, the MEA spokesperson said India expects a fair, just and transparent legal process in the case.</p>

<p>"We have spoken on this issue earlier. We would like to reiterate our expectation that relevant legal processes underway in Bangladesh are executed in a fair, just and transparent manner, ensuring full respect for the legal rights of concerned individuals," he said.</p>

<p>The relations between India and Bangladesh came under strain after the interim government headed by Muhammad Yunus came to power in the neighbouring country. The relations deteriorated further in recent weeks over attacks on Hindus and the arrest of Chinmoy Das.</p>

<p>The attacks triggered protests in India. The Bangladesh foreign ministry summoned the Indian envoy recently and lodged a protest over the storming of the Bangladeshi mission in Agartala by a group of protesters.</p>

<p>India last week said the interim government in Bangladesh must live up to its responsibility of protecting all minorities as it expressed serious concern over the "surge" of extremist rhetoric and increasing incidents of violence against Hindus.</p>

<p>India had also hoped that the case relating to Chinmoy Das, arrested on the charge of sedition, will be dealt with in a just and fair manner.</p>

<p>Chinmoy Das was arrested at Dhaka's Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport last month in connection with a sedition case.<br />

<h2><strong>WHAT IS HAPPENING IN SYRIA - AND HOW BAD IS THE SITUATION</strong></h2>

<p>Syria is in the midst of a political turmoil, with the Russia and Iran-backed Bashar Al-Assad regime finding itself surrounded by rebel groups and militias which are backed by Turkey. Rebel forces have, over the last week, pressed a lightning offensive across Syria aiming to overthrow President Bashar al-Assad.</p>

<p>The Islamist-led rebels were at the gates of Syria's Homs, a war monitor told news agency AFP. Several other Syrian cities have fallen out of government control - some without even a bullet having to be fired.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-12/sigfteag_syria-islamist-rebel-forces-afp_625x300_07_December_24.jpg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>The offensive by the Islamist rebels have been so swift, that Syria's second city Aleppo and strategically located Hama have already fallen from President Bashar al-Assad's control. This has happened for the first time since the civil war began in 2011.</p>

<p>Bashar al-Assad's clan has ruled Syria for the past five decades, but for the first time ever, it has looked truly vulnerable to a total collapse. Should the rebels capture Homs, it would cut the seat of power in the capital Damascus from the Mediterranean coast, a key bastion of Bashar Assad.</p>

<p>According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitor, by Friday morning (local time), the Islamist rebels were less than five kilometres from the edge of Homs.</p>

<h2><strong>WHO IS BEHIND THIS - AND WHAT IS HIS PAST</strong></h2>

<p>Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, the leader of the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham or HTS rebel alliance, has categorically said that the goal of this offensive is to overthrow Bashar al-Assad and end his rule in Syria.</p>

<p>"When we talk about objectives, the goal of the revolution remains the overthrow of this regime. It is our right to use all available means to achieve that goal," Jolani told CNN in an interview.</p>

<p>The Islamist rebel alliance conducting the offensive that began on November 27 is led by HTS, which stems from the Syrian branch of the Al Qaeda, but has sought to moderate its image in recent times.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-12/i6as6d3g_-abu-mohammed-algolani_625x300_06_December_24.jpg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>Abu Mohammed al-Jolani is also known as the 'blue-eyed boy' of ISIS terrorist Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Several years ago, he was kept at the infamous US detention facility in Iraq. But al-Jolani, once written-off as a lost cause by the US, has emerged from the shadows. He now finds himself as a power figure in Syria.</p>

<p>Interestingly, the Islamist rebels launched their offensive in Syria the same day a ceasefire took effect in the war between Israel and Lebanese Hezbollah, which along with Russia and Iran have been firm backers of the Bashar al-Assad government.</p>

<h2><strong>SYRIA'S FATE HANGS IN THE BALANCE</strong></h2>

<p>Turkey, which has extended its full support to the rebels, said on Friday that its Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan shall be meeting his Russian and Iranian counterparts this weekend in Qatar for an emergency discussion on the situation in Syria.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the political wing of the HTS-led rebel coalition has reportedly reached out to Russia and China to support them in their "struggle for liberation" from the decades-old Syrian regime headed by Bashar al-Assad.

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tech billionaire Elon Musk spent at least $270 million to help Donald Trump win the US presidency, according to new federal filings, making him the country's biggest political donor.</p>

<p>SpaceX and Tesla CEO Musk, the world's richest person, was an ardent supporter of Trump's White House campaign -- funneling money into door knocking operations and speaking at his rallies.</p>

<p>His financial backing, which has earned him a cost-cutting advisory role in Trump's incoming government, surpassed spending by any single political donor since at least 2010, according to data from nonprofit OpenSecrets.</p>

<p>The Washington Post reported that Musk spent more this election cycle than Trump backer Tim Mellon, who gave nearly $200 million and was previously the Republican's top donor.</p>

<p>Musk donated $238 million to America PAC, a political action committee that he founded to support Trump, filings late Thursday with the Federal Election Commission showed.</p>

<p>An additional $20 million went to the RBG PAC, a group that used advertising to soften Trump's hardline reputation on the key voter issue of abortion.</p>

<p>Musk has been an ever-present sidekick for Trump since his election victory in November, inviting him to watch a rocket launch in Texas by his SpaceX company.</p>

<p>Trump has selected the South African-born tycoon and fellow ally Vivek Ramaswamy to head the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, through which the pair have promised to deliver billions of dollars of cuts in federal spending.</p>

<p>However, with Musk's businesses all having varying degrees of interactions with US and foreign governments, his new position also raises concerns about conflict of interest.</p>

<p>The president-elect has nominated several people close to Musk for roles in his administration, including investor David Sacks as the so-called AI and crypto czar.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, billionaire astronaut Jared Isaacman, who has collaborated with Musk's SpaceX, was named the head of US space agency NASA.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gaza's civil defence agency said that 17 people were killed in an Israeli strike on Friday on a house in the Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza.</p>

<p>Civil defence agency spokesman Mahmud Bassal told AFP 17 people were killed in the strike, which occurred in the early evening.</p>

<p>Medical sources at Al-Awda hospital told AFP that 14 bodies had arrived at the facility from the camp.</p>

<p>The Israeli military did not reply to a request for comment.</p>

<p>Bassal added that nearby hospitals had received 39 wounded with rescue work ongoing at the scene of the strike, which "damaged multiple neighbouring houses".</p>

<p>The war in Gaza was sparked by Hamas's October 7, 2023 attack which resulted in the deaths of 1,208 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official figures.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory military campaign in Gaza has killed at least 44,612 people, a majority civilians, according to figures from the territory's Hamas-run health ministry which the UN considers reliable.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Elon Musk spent over a quarter of a billion dollars to help Donald Trump win November's presidential election, according to new filings, underscoring the influence one of the world's wealthiest people had on this year's White House race.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Elon Musk spent over a quarter of a billion dollars to help Donald Trump win November's presidential election, according to new filings, underscoring the influence one of the world's wealthiest people had on this year's White House race.</p>

<p>The billionaire owner of electric car maker Tesla and SpaceX gave $259 million to groups supporting Trump's 2024 campaign, according to new Federal Election Commission filings released late on Thursday.</p>

<p>The huge donations made Musk one of the biggest underwriters of a presidential campaign in U.S. history, helping him to become a powerful political ally of Trump and someone who now plays a key role in shaping the incoming Republican administration's policy agenda.</p>

<p>Musk gave $239 million to America PAC, a super PAC he founded to help turn out voters for Trump.</p>

<p>In late October Musk gave an additional $20 million to RBG PAC, a group that sought to convince voters that Trump would not sign into a law a national abortion ban, according to the FEC filings. The group's name refers to the late Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a liberal icon known for her support of abortion rights.</p>

<p>Musk, who also owns the social media platform X, has emerged as a close advisor in Trump's transition team. Trump has chosen him, along with former Republican presidential candidate and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, to head a task force aimed at slashing government spending and regulations.</p>

<p>Musk and Ramaswamy met on Capitol Hill on Thursday with lawmakers whose support they will need to win the sweeping spending cuts Trump has asked them to find.</p>

<p>The two men have called for firing thousands of federal workers, slashing regulations and eliminating programs whose authorization has expired, such as veterans' healthcare.</p>

<p>Musk has also been a regular fixture and Trump confidante at the president-elect's Mar-a-Lago Florida estate during the transition.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[A US federal appeals court on Friday upheld a law requiring Chinese-based ByteDance to divest its popular short video app TikTok in the United States by early next year or face a ban.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A US federal appeals court on Friday upheld a law requiring Chinese-based ByteDance to divest its popular short video app TikTok in the United States by early next year or face a ban.</p>

<p>The decision is a win for the Justice Department and opponents of the Chinese-owned app and a devastating blow to ByteDance. The ruling now increases the possibility of an unprecedented ban in just six weeks on a social media app used by 170 million Americans.</p>

<p>The ruling is expected to be appealed to the Supreme Court.</p>

<p>Free speech advocates immediately criticized the decision. The American Civil Liberties Union said it sets a "flawed and dangerous precedent."</p>

<p>"Banning TikTok blatantly violates the First Amendment rights of millions of Americans who use this app to express themselves and communicate with people around the world," said Patrick Toomey, deputy director of the ACLU's National Security Project.</p>

<p>But the appeals court said the law "was the culmination of extensive, bipartisan action by the Congress and by successive presidents. It was carefully crafted to deal only with control by a foreign adversary, and it was part of a broader effort to counter a well-substantiated national security threat posed by the PRC (People's Republic of China)."</p>

<p>US appeals court Judges Sri Srinivasan, Neomi Rao and Douglas Ginsburg considered the legal challenges brought by TikTok and users against the law that gives ByteDance until Jan. 19 to sell or divest TikTok's US assets or face a ban.</p>

<p>The decision -- unless the Supreme Court reverses it -- puts TikTok's fate in the hands of first President Joe Biden on whether to grant a 90-day extension of the Jan. 19 deadline to force a sale and then President-elect Donald Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20. But it's not clear whether ByteDance could meet the heavy burden to show it had made significant progress toward a divestiture needed to trigger the extension.</p>

<p>Trump, who unsuccessfully tried to ban TikTok during his first term in 2020, said before the November presidential election he would not allow the TikTok ban.</p>

<p>TikTok said it expected the Supreme Court would reverse the appeals court decision on First Amendment grounds.</p>

<p>"The Supreme Court has an established historical record of protecting Americans' right to free speech, and we expect they will do just that on this important constitutional issue," TikTok said in a statement, adding the law will result "in outright censorship of the American people."</p>

<p>The Justice Department did not have an immediate comment on the decision.</p>

<p>The decision upholds the law giving the U.S. government sweeping powers to ban other foreign-owned apps that could raise concerns about collection of Americans' data. In 2020, Trump also tried to ban Tencent-owned WeChat, but was blocked by the courts.</p>

<p>Shares of Meta Platforms, which competes against TikTok in online ads, hit an intraday record high following the ruling, last up over 3%. Google parent Alphabet, whose YouTube video platform also competes with TikTok, was up over 1% following the ruling.</p>

<h2><strong>TIKTOK BAN LOOMS</strong></h2>

<p>The court acknowledged its decision would lead to TikTok's ban on Jan. 19 without an extension from Biden.</p>

<p>"Consequently, TikTok's millions of users will need to find alternative media of communication," the court said, which was because of China's "hybrid commercial threat to U.S. national security, not to the U.S. Government, which engaged with TikTok through a multi-year process in an effort to find an alternative solution."</p>

<p>The opinion was written by Ginsburg, an appointee of President Ronald Reagan, and joined by Rao, who was named to the bench by Trump, and Srinivasan, an appointee of President Barack Obama.</p>

<p>The Justice Department says under Chinese ownership, TikTok poses a serious national security threat because of its access to vast personal data of Americans, asserting China can covertly manipulate information that Americans consume via TikTok.</p>

<p>U.S. officials have also warned TikTok's management is beholden to the Chinese government, which could compel the company to share the data of its American users.</p>

<p>TikTok has denied it has or ever would share U.S. user data, accusing American lawmakers in the lawsuit of advancing "speculative" concerns.</p>

<p>TikTok and ByteDance argue the law is unconstitutional and violates Americans' free speech rights. They call it "a radical departure from this country's tradition of championing an open Internet."</p>

<p>ByteDance, backed by Sequoia Capital, Susquehanna International Group, KKR &amp; Co, and General Atlantic, among others, was valued at $268 billion in December 2023 when it offered to buy back around $5 billion worth of shares from investors, Reuters reported then.</p>

<p>The law prohibits app stores like Apple and Alphabet's Google from offering TikTok and bars internet hosting services from supporting TikTok unless ByteDance divests TikTok by the deadline.</p>

<p>Apple and Google did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p>

<p>In a concurring opinion, Srinivasan acknowledged the decision will have major impacts, noting "170 million Americans use TikTok to create and view all sorts of free expression and engage with one another and the world. And yet, in part precisely because of the platform's expansive reach, Congress and multiple Presidents determined that divesting it from (China's) control is essential to protect our national security."</p>

<p>He added that "Because the record reflects that Congress's decision was considered, consistent with longstanding regulatory practice, and devoid of an institutional aim to suppress particular messages or ideas, we are not in a position to set it aside."<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;Pakistan's jailed former prime minister Imran Khan has issued a warning of a civil disobedience movement following massive protests led by his party that were forcibly dispersed by the police.</p>

<p>In a post on X on Thursday, the 72-year-old Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf chief announced a five-member committee to address political prisoners' release and push for a judicial probe into the May 9 violence and the alleged killings of his party workers during the November 26 protest.</p>

<p>He said the negotiation committee will include Leader of the Opposition Umar Ayub Khan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur.</p>

<p>"If these two demands are not accepted, civil disobedience movement will be started from December 14. The government will be responsible for the results of this movement," Khan said.</p>

<p>In a post on Friday, he said that in case of a failure to meet the demands, "civil disobedience, reduction of remittances and boycott movement will be initiated." On November 14, Khan issued a "final call" for nationwide protests, demanding the restoration of the PTI's electoral mandate, the release of detained party members, and the reversal of the 26th Amendment, which he said had strengthened a "dictatorial regime".</p>

<p>His PTI party launched the protest on November 24 to give a sit-in at D-Chowk in Islamabad's Red Zone, where most government buildings are located. His supporters were forcibly dispersed on the night of November 26 when they reached close to D-Chowk.</p>

<p>The PTI claims that at least 12 party workers were killed and hundreds injured due to the direct firing by law enforcers in Islamabad during the protest.</p>

<p>The government, however, insists that no PTI worker was killed from bullet wounds.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[French President Emmanuel Macron has vowed to name a new prime minister in the "coming days" to replace Michel Barnier, who was toppled by a no confidence vote after just three months in office.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>French President Emmanuel Macron has vowed to name a new prime minister in the "coming days" to replace Michel Barnier, who was toppled by a no confidence vote after just three months in office.</p>

<p>Macron did not announce a name in an address to the nation late on Thursday and the appointment is no longer expected before Monday, multiple sources told AFP.</p>

<p>Barnier was Macron's fifth prime minister since coming to power in 2017. Each successive premier has served for a shorter period than their predecessor and given the composition of the National Assembly, there is no guarantee that Barnier's successor will last any longer than he did.</p>

<p>Here, AFP looks at the four names seen as the most likely contenders.</p>

<p>All the possible candidates so far are men and all were already in the running in September when Barnier was eventually appointed.</p>

<p>But it is far from ruled out that another candidate could emerge, with Barnier himself only coming into contention at the last moment back then.</p>

<p><strong>Sebastien Lecornu</strong></p>

<p>The ultimate Macron loyalist, Lecornu was the only key minister to stay on from the previous government in the last cabinet reshuffle in September, a measure of the importance of his job in the third year of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.</p>

<p>A career politician, Lecornu, still only 38, started out as a parliamentary assistant aged just 19. He has held ministerial posts ever since Macron came to power in 2017 and was promoted to defence minister in May 2022.</p>

<p>He has worked staunchly to keep up assistance for Ukraine, while carefully remaining in the shadows with infrequent media appearances.</p>

<p>Some French media, including BFM-TV, reported that Macron had been close to naming Lecornu in his address on Thursday but decided to take more time after some within the presidential camp said the minister was too right-wing.</p>

<p><strong>Francois Bayrou</strong></p>

<p>A heavyweight politician who has been allied to Macron since he swept to power in the 2017 election campaign, Bayrou heads the MoDem party which is allied to, but not part of, Macron's centrist force.</p>

<p>Bayrou, 73, was acquitted in February after a seven-year-long case over the fraudulent employment of parliamentary assistants by his party, with the judge ruling that he was owed the "benefit of the doubt".</p>

<p>A three-time presidential candidate, Bayrou was named justice minister by Macron when he took the presidency in 2017.</p>

<p>He resigned the same year when the legal case was opened against him but he remained a key behind-the-scenes ally, with his acquittal opening up a potential return to government.</p>

<p><strong>Xavier Bertrand</strong></p>

<p>Bertrand, 59, is the right-wing head of the northern Hauts-de-France region and previously served as labour and health minister between 2005 and 2012 under presidents Jacques Chirac and Nicolas Sarkozy.</p>

<p>An articulate media performer, Bertrand unsuccessfully sought the nomination of the right-wing Republicans (LR) party to fight the 2022 presidential elections.</p>

<p>He remains close to Sarkozy who, despite criminal convictions in trials since leaving office, wields considerable influence over the traditional right.</p>

<p><strong>Bernard Cazeneuve</strong></p>

<p>Former Socialist Party grandee Bernard Cazeneuve, 61, held the post of prime minister for less than half a year under the presidency of Francois Hollande from 2016-2017.</p>

<p>He is better known for his much longer stint as interior minister under Hollande, which coincided with the radical Islamist attacks on Paris in November 2015.</p>

<p>Cazeneuve quit the Socialists in 2022 in protest at the party's broad left-wing pact with factions including the hard-left France Unbowed (LFI) and still has a tense relationship with his former colleagues.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russia could deploy its newly developed hypersonic Oreshnik missiles in Belarus next year as it begins to ramp up their production, President Vladimir Putin said on Friday.</p>

<p>Putin unveiled the nuclear-capable weapon last month after using it to strike the city of Dnipro in central Ukraine, sharply escalating tensions in the almost three-year-long conflict.</p>

<p>"As for the possibility of deploying, to put it bluntly, such formidable weapons as Oreshnik on Belarusian territory... it will become possible, I think, in the second half of next year," Putin said in a televised meeting with Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko in Minsk.</p>

<p>He said this would happen as "serial production" of the missile is "ramped up in Russia".</p>

<p>Russia had already deployed tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus in 2023.</p>

<p>Experts believe the new missile flies at 10 times the speed of sound and may be able to strike targets up to 5,500 kilometres (3,400 miles) away.</p>

<p>Moscow is Belarus's closest ally, with the two countries strengthening their military cooperation throughout the Kremlin's offensive in Ukraine.</p>

<p>Tactical nuclear weapons, designed for use on the battlefield, are smaller than the strategic nuclear weapons used to wipe out whole cities but are still extremely destructive.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>427 years after William Shakespeare wrote it for the first time in the great "tragedy" Romeo &amp; Juliet, England is asking the quintessential question - "What's in a name?" - And this time wondering what significance that question might hold in another 42.7 years.</p>

<p>The Department of Statistics in the United Kingdom has revealed in its latest dataset that Muhammad is officially the most popular name for a newborn boy in England and Wales. More than 4,600 babies were registered with that name in 2023 - the highest for a boy. Muhammad was the second-most popular name in 2022 as well.</p>

<p>Noah, once the most popular name in UK, came a distant second this year, according to the Office for National Statistics or ONS.</p>

<p>But the staff at Great Britain's statistical office has in-fact been observing the trend for a while now. Jotting down the most popular names in the UK, besides other important statistics, it revealed that Muhammad has been among the top 10 names for baby boys since 2016.</p>

<p>Adding to the cheer, the Department of Statistics said that other spellings of the name Muhammad - namely Mohammed and Mohammad - also made the top 100 list for England and Wales. This, the ONS explained, is because it considers each spelling as a separate name.</p>

<p>Victoria, Harry, William, and Charlotte are no longer popular names for children in the UK, the data showed, adding that Elizabeth and Charles are also not a favourite among young parents.</p>

<p>The nine other top names for newborn boys in Britain are - Noah, Oliver, George, Leo, Arthur, Luca, Theodore, Oscar, and Henry.</p>

<p>For newborn girls, the ten most popular names in Britain in 2023 were - Olivia, Amelia, Isla, Lily, Freya, Ava, Ivy, Florence, Willow, and Isabella. The top three names for girls have remained unchanged for a third consecutive year.</p>

<p>The statistical office also said that new entries to the list of top 100 baby names include Hazel, Lilah, Autumn, Nevaeh and Raya for girls, and Jax, Enzo, and Bodhi for boys.</p>

<p>It further noted that the time of year also played an important part in parents choosing a name. In the month of December, Holly, Robyn and Joseph were more popular, whereas names like Summer and Autumn were popular in their respective seasons.</p>

<p>Data revealed that pop culture also played a big part in how baby names were chosen. The most popular celebrity names for babies include music artists Billie Eilish and Lana Del Rey, baby names from the Kardashian-Jenner family such as Reign and Saint, and movie stars such as Margot Robbie and Cillian Murphy.</p>

<p>The statistical office said that the top names for boys had much higher counts than those for girls. This is because, there are many more unique names for baby girls as compared to baby boys. The pool of unique names for girls are over 35,000 in count, while for boys the pool, including variations of the same name, stands at 29,560.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p>

<p>President-elect Donald Trump has decided not to leave behind his Pentagon pick Pete Hegseth and reiterated his "strong and deep" support for the former Fox News presenter.</p>

<p>In a post on his social media platform Truth Social, Trump wrote, "Pete Hegseth is doing very well. His support is strong and deep, much more so than the Fake News would have you believe. He was a great student - Princeton/Harvard educated - with a Military state of mind. He will be a fantastic, high energy, Secretary of Defense Defense, one who leads with charisma and skill. Pete is a WINNER, and there is nothing that can be done to change that!!!"</p>

<p>In response, Hegseth wrote, "Thank you Mr. President. Like you, we will never back down."</p>

<p>Hegeth had spent the week meeting senators and trying to gain some support amid the flurry of backlash he has been facing for the sexual assault, alcohol abuse and financial mismanagement accusations.</p>

<p>Although Trump is backing Hegseth publicly, he has been looking for more options for the role of Defence secretary, and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has been on his radar. But Hegseth seems confident about Trump's reliability on him and said, "As long as Donald Trump wants me in this fight, I'm going to be standing right here in this fight," on Thursday.</p>

<p>Hegseth is one of the many controversial picks by Trump, including Matt Gaetz who recently withdrew his name from the post of attorney general after days of debate regarding whether the congressional report about his sexual misconduct should be released.</p>

<p>Apart from the President-elect, he also has the Vice-President-elect backing him. He wrote on X, "Led by President Trump, we're fighting for Pete Hegseth. And we're doing so because Pete Hegseth will fight for our troops. For too long, the Pentagon has been led by people who lose wars. Pete Hegseth is a man who fought in those wars. We've got his back."<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iran is "dramatically" increasing the amount of uranium enriched to up to 60% purity, close to the roughly 90% of weapons grade, that it is able to produce, the watchdog's chief Rafael Grossi told Reuters in an interview.</p>

<p>The move is certain to cause even greater alarm in Western capitals already arguing that there is no civil justification for Iran's enrichment to that level as no other country has done so without producing nuclear bombs, which Iran denies pursuing.</p>

<p>Iran already has enough material enriched to up to 60%, its most highly enriched stock, for four nuclear weapons in principle if it enriched it further, according to an IAEA yardstick. It has enough for more at lower enrichment levels.</p>

<p>"Today the agency is announcing that the production capacity is increasing dramatically of the 60% inventory," International Atomic Energy Agency chief Grossi said on the sidelines of the Manama Dialogue security conference in Bahrain's capital.</p>

<p>He added that it was set to rise to "seven, eight times more, maybe, or even more" than the previous rate of 5-7 kg a month.</p>

<p>The move is also a setback for Grossi since he said after a trip to Iran last month that Tehran had accepted his "request" that it cap its stock of uranium enriched to up to 60% to ease diplomatic tensions, calling it "a concrete step in the right direction".</p>

<p>Diplomats said at the time, however, that Iran's step, which included preparing to implement that cap, was conditional on the IAEA's 35-nation Board of Governors not passing a resolution against Iran over its insufficient cooperation with the agency, which the Board then did regardless.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A nun in Italy has been arrested on suspicion of being part of a criminal gang which had links to the country's most powerful mafia network, the 'Ndrangheta. According to the <em>BBC</em>, the nun, named Sister Anna Donelli, was among 24 people who were arrested in northern Italy in connection with the mafia investigation. She was arrested for allegedly acting as a go-between for the 'Ndrangheta mafia and its jailed gang members, Italian police said. The arrests are a result of a four-year investigation into the 'Ndrangheta, which is one of Europe's most influential and dangerous criminal organisations, the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gzx7wzdk9o" rel="noindex,nofollow">outlet </a>reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to the statements released by the coalition of law enforcement agencies, the 57-year-old nun leveraged her position as a volunteer at the prison. The Brescia Carabinieri said she was an unsuspecting figure, whose religious role allowed her "free access to the penitentiary facilities".</p>

<p>Officials accused her of being an intermediary, "exploiting the very spiritual role she carried out" to pass messages and orders between bosses on the inside and foot soldiers tied to Italy's notorious 'Ndrangheta organized crime syndicate based in Calabria, in the south of the country.</p>

<p>"She carried orders, directives, moral and material aid to associates, receiving in turn from the prisoners useful information to better plan criminal strategies," said prosecutor Francesco Prete, per <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/05/europe/catholic-nun-25-arrested-italy-intl-latam/index.html" rel="noindex,nofollow"><em>CNN</em></a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He added that Donelli, who is currently under house arrest, was "at the disposal of the criminal association to guarantee the connection with the associates detained in prison and those outside."</p>

<p>Along with Donelli, two politicians have also been arrested. Cops also seized 1.8 million euros ($1.9 million) worth of assets in raids across several towns in the Lombardy and Veneto regions, as well as Calabria in the south.</p>

<p>The operation is ongoing, with police officers conducting searches across northern Italy. Investigators allege the group primarily used scrap metal trade businesses as a front to launder money, totalling approximately &amp;#8364;12m in laundered cash, prosecutors said.</p>

<p>Notably, the 'Ndrangheta is considered one of the world's most dangerous criminal organisations.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ukraine showed off a new locally-produced "rocket-drone" on Friday which it said could fly 700 km (430 miles) - more than twice the longest range attributed to missiles supplied by Western allies.</p>

<p>The unmanned craft, called "Peklo" - which means hell in Ukrainian - is the second such "rocket drone" unveiled by Kyiv as it tries to increase its ability to strike deep into Russia, which invaded 33 months ago.</p>

<p>The drones could reach speeds of 700 kph, a representative from Ukraine's state arms manufacturer Ukroboronprom told reporters at a ceremony where they were officially handed over to the armed forces.</p>

<p>No other details were provided and no evidence was given of the drone's range or speed. Ukraine has released few details of its arms industry, citing concerns about giving useful information to Moscow.</p>

<p>Ukraine's arms production minister told Reuters in November the "rocket-drone" could be viewed as something akin to a cruise missile, which flies low on a guided path to its target, usually below the speed of sound.</p>

<p>The drones were more than a metre long, with small wings on either side and two tail fins. US-supplied ATACMS missiles have a declared range of just over 300 km.</p>

<p>Russia has used thousands of long-range missiles and drones to hit military and infrastructure targets all over Ukraine.</p>

<p>Kyiv has sought the ability to strike back, but its allies until last month resisted calls to allow use of their missiles on targets deep inside Russia.</p>

<p>Ukraine has sought to balance the long-range strike gap throughout the war by launching explosive-laden propeller drones at targets up to 1,000 km inside Russia.</p>

<p>President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who was at Friday's ceremony, said last month that Ukraine was developing four different missiles.</p>

<p>However, despite successful launches already having taken place, the missile programme has been plagued by global supply chain issues, Ukraine's arms minister previously told Reuters.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President Vladimir Putin has replaced the governor of the Kursk region -- partly controlled by Ukraine -- saying it needs a "crisis" manager, after residents voiced anger at the handling of the incursion.</p>

<p>Ukrainian troops launched a shock offensive into Kursk in August, forcing thousands to flee border areas. Ukraine's army said in November it controls 800 square kilometres (310 square miles) of territory in the region.</p>

<p>Putin appointed Alexander Khinshtein -- a prominent pro-Kremlin lawmaker -- as acting Kursk governor late on Thursday.</p>

<p>"There is a need for crisis management there," Putin said in a meeting with Khinshtein.</p>

<p>"The most important thing is to organise work on helping people," he added.</p>

<p>Acknowledging communications failures, Khinshtein told Putin: "We have to do all we can so that all residents of Kursk region fully feel that they are part of our one big country."</p>

<p>The previous regional chief, Alexei Smirnov, became acting governor in May and was inaugurated in September. He left voluntarily, according to the Kremlin and wrote on Telegram he has a new post.</p>

<p>Smirnov had drawn criticism over his appearances at televised meetings after the incursion, appearing formulaic and lacking a personal touch.</p>

<p>Putin considers Khinshtein "can better deal with this role", said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, denying there was any "grievances" against Smirnov.</p>

<p>Since August, Kursk locals have taken to social media to voice anger at the lack of warnings over the incursion and the handling of the crisis.</p>

<p>Some have created video messages to Putin pleading for help, though discontent is rarely shown on official media.</p>

<p>Some residents of Olgovka, about 17 kilometres (10 miles) from the border, said their village looks "like a scene from a horror film" and "we have found ourselves homeless".</p>

<p>"Some of our fellow villagers were killed, some are missing, since evacuation was not announced and some did not have time to leave," a village spokesman said.</p>

<p>At a public meeting last month, former Kursk governor Roman Starovoit, now transport minister, acknowledged the Russian military had looted in a district under their control, after official media blamed Ukrainians.</p>

<p>Starovoit told a Life News journalist Friday: "I hope (Khinshtein) will have enough experience to organise communications, first and foremost," calling it a "shortcoming" of the ousted Smirnov.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Friday linked an arson attack on a synagogue in Australia to what he called Canberra's "anti-Israel sentiment".</p>

<p>Police in the Australian city of Melbourne said mask-wearing arsonists attacked a synagogue before dawn on Friday. They were still searching for the suspects and said they did not know why the premises had been targeted.</p>

<p>In a statement, Netanyahu said that "this heinous act cannot be separated from the anti-Israel sentiment emanating from the Australian Labor government."</p>

<p>He cited Canberra's "outrageous decision" to vote for a United Nations General Assembly resolution that demanded the end of Israel's "unlawful presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory".</p>

<p>Netanyahu argued that "anti-Israel sentiment is anti-Semitism".</p>

<p>Australia's was among 157 votes in favour of the resolution on December 3, after it abstained in a similar vote in September.</p>

<p>No serious injuries were reported in the fire which eviscerated much of the synagogue building. Congregants were only beginning to gather for morning prayers as the attack took place, a board member said.</p>

<p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said federal police would help their state counterparts to investigate. He condemned the attack and said he had "zero tolerance" for anti-Semitism.</p>

<p>"This violence and intimidation and destruction at a place of worship is an outrage," he said in a statement.</p>

<p>Netanyahu called the attack "a vile, classic anti-Semitic act, and I expect the authorities in Australia to use the full extent of their power to prevent such anti-Semitic attacks in the future".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The trial of a Frenchman who recruited dozens of strangers to rape his drugged wife at their home resumes on Monday, with the cases of eight new defendants to be examined in court.</p>

<p>The case of Dominique Pelicot, 71, and 50 other co-defendants aged 26 to 74 years old has caused outrage and sparked protests since it opened on September 2 in the southern city of Avignon.</p>

<p>For refusing to be ashamed and demanding the trial be open to the public, his ex-wife Gisele Pelicot, also 71, has become a feminist heroine in France and abroad.</p>

<p>The court has already questioned 36 of the defendants, including Pelicot himself, and will after a week's break on Monday start examining eight more of the co-accused.</p>

<p>Antoine Camus, one of Gisele Pelicot's lawyers, said the international attention had given his client the strength to carry on.</p>

<p>"It's an endurance race, but she of course remains ready for the fight and determined to see it through, because she has also been uplifted by this wave of support in France and abroad," he told AFP.</p>

<p>"She very often receives many accounts that uplift her and help her in this marathon, which she is completing not just for herself."</p>

<p>The abuse was uncovered after police in 2020 arrested Dominique Pelicot for filming up women's skirts in a local supermarket.</p>

<p>He has admitted to raping his then wife Gisele Pelicot and enlisting dozens to join him between 2011 and 2020, meticulously documenting the abuse in thousands of images investigators found on his hard drives.</p>

<p><strong>Driver, cleaner, HIV positive man</strong></p>

<p>But his co-accused, most of whom risk up to 20 years in jail for aggravated rape in convicted, have largely claimed they had no idea it was rape.</p>

<p>They have said they thought they were taking part in the sex game of a libertine couple.</p>

<p>"It's really tiring for Gisele Pelicot to almost systematically hear the same explanations from the accused," Camus said. "That was victim of rape 'by accident', rape 'by error of judgement', or 'reluctant' rape."</p>

<p>The next eight men to be cross-examined from Monday include a 36-year-old truck driver, a 31-year-old labourer, a 36-year-old cleaner and a 42-year-old restaurant manager.</p>

<p>Among them is a 50-year-old software technician who has been accused of planning to imitate Dominique Pelicot's methods on his own wife.</p>

<p>An HIV-positive single man, now aged 63, has been charged with visiting the Pelicot home in the southern town of Mazan six times to abuse Gisele Pelicot, not once using a condom.</p>

<p>The court will also examine the case of a 30-year-old who is the only co-defendant being tried in absentia.</p>

<p><strong>'Abused his own daughter'</strong></p>

<p>Finally, an unemployed 41-year-old has been accused of raping Gisele Pelicot in 2019, with the complicity of her then husband, at the home of the couple's daughter in the Paris region.</p>

<p>He denied committing rape of the first day of the trial.</p>

<p>The couple's two sons and daughter, who goes by her pen name Caroline Darian, have regularly appeared at the trial to support their mother.</p>

<p>But Darian was not present at some of the more recent hearings.</p>

<p>In late October, after the trial reached half-mark, she announced on Instagram that she was checking in to a clinic for a few days to recharge and "to be able to sleep again".</p>

<p>Darian, who in 2022 wrote a book "Et j'ai cesse de t'appeler papa" ("And I stopped calling you dad"), has campaigned for awareness about the use of drugs to commit sexual abuse.</p>

<p>She left the courtroom in tears early during the trial as the presiding judge recounted how her father also had naked photomontages of her on his computer.</p>

<p>"I too am a victim of Dominique P," Darian wrote on Instagram.</p>

<p>"He drugged me without my knowledge, and without a doubt abused his own and only daughter."</p>

<p>The trial is to last until December 20.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Experts say warmer temperatures across the Alps are accelerating glacier melt and thawing permafrost, the year-round ice that binds together giant slabs of rock.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The historic Zittel hut on top of a snow-capped mountain high in the Austrian Alps has weathered many a storm.</p>

<p>But ever more extreme climate change is taking a terrible toll on the century-old wooden refuge.</p>

<p>"When your hand fits into a crack in the foundation, there is need for action," said Georg Unterberger, who is in charge of mountain refuges and trails at the Austrian Alpine club.</p>

<p>The trails up to refuge on the 3,106-metre (10,190-foot) Sonnblick mountain are also suffering.</p>

<p>Experts say warmer temperatures across the Alps are accelerating glacier melt and thawing permafrost, the year-round ice that binds together giant slabs of rock.</p>

<p>This has increased the danger of sudden rockfalls and landslides, damaging paths and putting more pressure on the often ageing and neglected huts.</p>

<p>Austria's Alpine clubs are currently closing up to four huts a year as they become unsafe or too costly to maintain.</p>

<p>With the country heavily dependent on Alpine tourism, the cost of keeping up the trails "have doubled in the last five years", said Unterberger, who also works as a building surveyor.</p>

<p>Each year about one million people visit the more than 200 mountain huts the Austrian Alpine club -- the country's biggest -- operates.</p>

<p><strong>'Struggling on all fours'</strong></p>

<p>The trail up to the Zittel in the Salzburg region was always a black-rated one, but "now it's even more dangerous", Unterberger told AFP.</p>

<p>Hikers may now need climbing gear to reach it as the retreating glacier that once went all the way up to the popular refuge has exposed steep rock faces and vast fields of scree.</p>

<p>"I've seen hikers struggle on all fours to make it," Unterberger said, adding that work on trails has dramatically increased in recent years, with ropes and steel rungs having to be put in place.</p>

<p>At the Zittel hut, the crumbling foundation and the weather-worn wooden shingles require urgent renovation and thermal insulation.</p>

<p>Thawing permafrost threatened the very existence of the hut and the adjacent observatory -- one of the world's oldest high-altitude weather stations -- already years ago, with the peak at risk of falling apart.</p>

<p>To keep it from disintegrating, workers rammed steel anchors 20 metres into the mountain top and further supported the summit with concrete braces.</p>

<p>For now the peak is stable, but further measures cannot be ruled out.</p>

<p>More money is needed to remedy the decaying infrastructure in the Austrian Alps, with experts saying 272 out of 429 mountain refuges, as well as 50,000 kilometres (31,000 miles) of trails, are in dire need of repair.</p>

<p>In a petition earlier this year, the cash-strapped Alpine clubs urged the government to provide an emergency fund of 95 million euros ($103 million).</p>

<p>So far the government has pledged just three million euros.</p>

<p>Unlike in neighbouring Switzerland, where the cantons are in charge of maintaining the trail network, Austrian Alpine clubs heavily rely on ever scarcer volunteers.</p>

<p>"Many of our 25,000 volunteers are more than 65 years old and recruiting young people has been a challenge," said Unterberger, observing a trend towards "micro-volunteering" for a few hours or a day, but not more.</p>

<p><strong>'Critical situation'</strong></p>

<p>The Zittel refuge shares the summit with the Sonnblick observatory, which has been measuring and documenting the changes to climate since it opened in 1886.</p>

<p>Up on the mountain, the temperature has been recorded for 138 years straight, the longest uninterrupted high-altitude data anywhere in the world.</p>

<p>This data helps scientists worldwide to refine their climate models -- while it also offers a glimpse into the future.</p>

<p>Since the 1950s all high mountain regions like "the Alps, the Rocky Mountains, the Andes, the Himalayas -- have already seen an average annual temperature increase of more than two degrees Celsius", which is twice the global average, observatory head Elke Ludewig told AFP.</p>

<p>"As nice as it is to still see snow and glaciers, we really have a critical situation here in terms of the rate at which temperatures are increasing," she said.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The most memorable moment of King Charles and Queen Camilla's recent royal tour of Australia and Samoa was Australian indigenous senator Lidia Thorpe's insult to the monarchy. She was escorted out of Canberra's Parliament House after she heckled the King and accused him of genocide. The British media was incensed, calling her “outburst” simply “rude” and “ill-mannered”.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>True, Senator Thorpe's behaviour may be unwarranted. However, it ensured that the royal visit was anything but forgettable. A couple of days later, the issue of reparations raised by the former British colonies at the two-day biennial Commonwealth Summit in Samoa was another rough treatment the British royalty received in quick succession.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>A Direct Message In Samoa</strong></h2>

<p>Set roughly midway between New Zealand and Hawaii, the summit in Samoa last month saw King Charles and UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer join leaders from 56 Commonwealth nations. It coincided with the BRICS Summit in Kazan and therefore received little coverage in India. Anyway, the setting may have been remote, but the message on reparations was direct and one that won't be easy to ignore. Good that the leaders of two heavyweight Commonwealth countries, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, were attending the BRICS summit. Their presence would have made things more difficult for the UK government. India was represented at the summit by Union Minister of Parliamentary Affairs, Kiren Rijiju.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, calls for the UK to pay monetary compensation and extend a formal apology over its role in the trans-Atlantic slave trade resurfaced with fresh urgency at the summit. The UK, expectedly, had vetoed the proposal to directly address reparations in the summit's final communique. Instead, the document tiptoed around the issue, referencing only the possibility of “future discussions” on “reparatory justice” regarding the trans-Atlantic trade in enslaved Africans.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer rejected calls for an apology and reparations, telling delegates that it was futile to have "very long, endless discussions" about the past. Instead, he urged the former colonies to focus on issues of the present, such as climate change, which his government could help. Speaking at the summit in Samoa, King Charles sounded more conciliatory: “None of us can change the past. But we can commit, with all our hearts, to learning its lessons and to finding creative ways to right the inequalities that endure.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>For the leaders of former colonies, however, this side-step will not likely put the topic to rest anytime soon</p>

<h2><strong>Apologies From Just A Few</strong></h2>

<p>Privately, some families who owned thousands of slaves have apologised for their part in the slave trade. For example, last year, descendants of the family of 19th-century British Prime Minister William Gladstone visited Barbados, St. Lucia and other Caribbean islands to acknowledge and apologise for their ancestor's involvement in slavery. John Gladstone, William's father, owned slaves on plantations in the Caribbean. William Gladstone, however, was a prominent abolitionist. Caribbean leaders welcomed the apology, calling it a step towards healing and reconciliation.</p>

<p>Like Britain, most European colonial powers have expressed regret over their past sins. But they have not formally apologised for it. The only notable exceptions are the Netherlands and Belgium. They have apologised for both colonial atrocities and slave trade involvement, though no monetary compensation has been promised.</p>

<h2><strong>Britain Owes Former Colonies $24 Trillion</strong></h2>

<p>Patrick Robinson, a UN judge, indicated last year that the United Kingdom may owe over $24 trillion in reparations for its role in the trans-Atlantic slave trade. In a report co-authored by him and published last year in June, he says he considers this figure a conservative assessment, noting the vast and lasting damage inflicted by the slave trade. The report calculates that in total, reparations to be paid by 31 former slaveholding colonial powers—including Spain, the United States and France—amount to $107.8 trillion. Expressing astonishment, Robinson remarked that certain states involved in slavery appear to ignore their obligations, stating, "Once a state has committed a wrongful act, it's obliged to pay reparations."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Robinson, known for presiding over the trial of former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, emphasised the principle that reparations are a duty, not an option. He has been a member of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) since 2015 and has been researching reparations as part of his honorary presidency of the American Society of International Law. It is nearly obvious that the former colonial powers, who are among some of the richest countries in the world, thanks to their colonial exploits, appear to be in no mood to pay compensation packages to the nations affected by the slave trade&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>"Am I Not A Man And A Brother"</strong></h2>

<p>The expansionist British Empire's exploitative system was based on three sins against humanity—colonisation, slave trade and indentured labour. Indentured labour was targeted against India more specifically.&nbsp;</p>

<p>One of the most enduring symbols from the 19th century's abolitionist movement is the sketch of a Black man in chains. If you take a closer look, it shows an enslaved Black man, kneeling in chains, with the words "Am I not a man and a brother" encircling him. The image and the plea punch a deep yearning for the enslaved African and Caribbean man's freedom and equality. This emblem challenged the cruelty of slavery and called for justice.</p>

<p>The British Empire bears a dark legacy as one of the largest forces in the trans-Atlantic slave trade, a tragedy that caused immense suffering and disruptions. Yet, it is only fair to acknowledge at the outset that Britain was also home to a powerful abolitionist movement that rallied the public at the grassroots level and pushed Parliament to abolish slavery in 1833. The Slavery Abolition Act undoubtedly marked a significant turn in the global fight against enslavement. It outlawed slavery in most of the British Empire.</p>

<p>But the abolition of one sin gave birth to another, equally evil in nature, indentured labour, which directly impacted India.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Slaves vs Coolies</strong></h2>

<p>Which is worse: the brutal reality of the slave trade or the ruthless grind of indentured labour—the so-called “coolies” of the British Raj? Each system wore a different mask, but all served the same purpose: to sustain the empire on the backs of exploited labour. The slave trade was raw oppression, tearing people from their homelands, stripping them of their identity and treating them as property. Then came indentured labour, not quite as blatant, but equally unforgiving. This “sanitised” slavery trapped workers in harsh conditions with barely a trace of freedom—a palatable replacement for the colonial conscience.</p>

<p>The British Empire ended the slave trade with the 1833 Abolition Act, yet hardly skipped a beat before instituting indentured labour the very next year, in 1834. Records show that private plantation owners actively lobbied the Empire for cheap labour from India, which soon became the backbone of colonial projects in far-flung corners of the Empire. Hundreds of thousands of Indian labourers—mostly poor, unlettered and desperate—were 'contracted' to work on plantations in the Caribbean countries and railroads, especially in East Africa. Many were coerced into these agreements, often only needing to affix a thumbprint to a piece of paper they couldn't read. What they signed away was their freedom, shackled to a five-year contract with slim hope for escape from abusive conditions. The British National Library has huge archives of papers pointing to several incidents of revolt by the labourers, many of whom were killed or maimed as punishment.<br />
<br />
So, which system bears the greater sin? Hard to say. But perhaps the most enduring sin is the claims by a few apologists in the West—which include some right-wing politicians—that these practices helped famine-stricken Indians improve their lives and that the entire colonial project was part of “civilising” the coolies.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two days ago, a video surfaced showing an Iranian woman stripping down to her underwear to protest harassment by the moral police at a university in Tehran. Footage on social media showed her being bundled into a car by men in plain clothes and being driven off to an undisclosed location.</p>

<p>The woman, who has not been identified, was allegedly harassed inside Tehran's prestigious Islamic Azad University by members of the Basij paramilitary force who ripped her headscarf and clothes, according to reports by several news outlets and social media channels outside Iran.</p>

<p>Azad University's public relations director Amir Mahjob said in a post on X that the student, separated from her husband and a mother of two, “had a mental disorder". Local newspaper Farhikhtegan too stated that she had been admitted to a mental health facility.</p>

<p>Two days later, her whereabouts remain unknown, which has prompted Amnesty International's Iran chapter to call for her immediate release. "Authorities must protect her from torture and other ill-treatment, and ensure access to family and lawyer. Allegations of beatings and sexual violence against her during arrest need independent and impartial investigations," the organisation said.</p>

<p>Mai Sato, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Islamic Republic of Iran, said on X that she would be “monitoring this incident closely, including the authorities' response.”</p>

<p>It is mandatory for women in Iran to wear a headscarf and loose-fitting clothes in public, the violation of which had led to the arrest of Iranian-Kurdish Mahsa Amini in 2022. Later, she died in custody, leading to vehement protests across the country where women removed and event burnt their headscarves. Iranian actress Hengameh Ghaziani was among those detained for removing her hijab on Instagram in solidarity with the movement. A subsequent crackdown left over 500 protesters dead.</p>

<p>Iran's morality police or Gasht-e-Ershad was established in 2006 to ensure the strict implementation of veiling laws that have existed since the 1980s. They patrol public places and have been present increasingly in schools and colleges, and monitor women's attire.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Since then, women have been protesting these laws, by wearing tight clothes or showing their hair in public and on social media.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Two families in the West Midlands are seeking compensation after a DNA test revealed two baby girls were switched at birth in an NHS hospital 55 years ago.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two families in the West Midlands are seeking compensation after a DNA test revealed two baby girls were switched at birth in an NHS hospital 55 years ago. Mr Tony, who took a DNA home-testing kit out of curiosity, discovered his supposed sister, Ms Jessica, was not biologically related to him. Instead, the test revealed a stranger, Ms Claire, as his full sibling. Further investigation confirmed Claire and Jessica were born in the same hospital around the same time.</p>

<p>Ms Joan, Mr Tony's mother, expressed her joy at having a daughter when Jessica was born in 1967. “It was a wonderful feeling, at long last having a girl,” she recalled to the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp3njqd9nl9o  " rel="nofollow,noindex">BBC</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;(Jessica and Claire are not their real names - both have been changed, to protect the women's identity)..&nbsp;</p>

<p>Using the messaging service from the DNA company, Mr Tony reached out to Ms Claire, who had also taken the same DNA test two years earlier. Ms Claire had experienced her own confusion when she received her results, having no connection to her supposed ancestry and discovering a genetic link to a first cousin she didn't recognise. Ms Claire, who had always felt like an “imposter” in her family, recalled thinking, “Yes, I'm adopted.”</p>

<p>Ms Claire was resolute in her desire to meet Mr Tony and their shared mother, Joan. “I just wanted to see them, meet them, talk to them and embrace them,” she said.</p>

<p>When Mr Tony finally revealed the truth to Ms Joan, she was desperate for answers. She recalled the night of Ms Jessica's birth with vivid detail: “They took me in on a Sunday… It snowed that day.” After holding her newborn daughter for just a few minutes, she was taken to the nursery, and the next morning, she was mistakenly given Ms Jessica instead of Ms Claire.</p>

<p>The families have since met, and Ms Claire has been integrating into her biological family. “It just felt right,” said Ms Joan, Ms Claire's biological mother. “I thought she looked just like I did in my younger days.”</p>

<p>The NHS trust has admitted liability for the baby swap, describing it as an “appalling error.” Compensation negotiations are ongoing.</p>

<p>Ms Joan stressed that her love for Ms Jessica, the woman she raised, remains unchanged. “She's still my daughter and she always will be.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As Election Day looms with <a href="https://theconversation.com/why-the-margin-of-error-matters-more-than-ever-in-reading-2024-election-polls-a-pollster-with-30-years-of-experience-explains-240633">Kamala Harris and Donald Trump locked in a dead heat</a>, pollsters and pundits are scrambling for clues to predict the outcome.</p>

<p>But what if the answer lies not in political data or campaign strategies, but in the instincts of a primitive part of the human brain?</p>

<p>New research I conducted with rhesus macaque monkeys suggests that when it comes to decisions like voting, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.09.17.613526">people are not nearly as rational</a> as they would like to believe.</p>

<p>It's easy to associate instinctual reactions – like the fight-or-flight response or reflexively pulling away from a hot surface – with the primitive motive for survival. But humans also have a rational brain that can gather and weigh evidence, deliberating thoughtfully rather than relying on knee-jerk reactions. Why that rational brain seems to be hijacked by primitive instincts in situations where rationality would serve people better is one of the many reasons <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=U9Hu2rcAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao">my neuroscience colleagues and I</a> have been studying rhesus macaques for the past 25 years.</p>

<p>These monkeys are <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-49922-6">remarkably similar to people</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/hmg/ddn167">genetically</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2019.0612">physiologically</a> and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/1866-1955-4-21">behaviorally</a>. These similarities have allowed researchers to make incredible medical breakthroughs, including the development of <a href="https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1458-24.2024">vaccines for polio, HIV/AIDS and COVID-19</a>, as well as <a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1902300116">deep brain stimulation treatment for Parkinson's disease</a> and other neurological disorders.</p>

<p>My research on candidate preference is part of an overall focus on <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-25607-1">enhancing scientists'</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.abl5794">understanding of</a> the ability to <a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.07.17.549328">interact effectively with others and to navigate social conflicts</a>, the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-020-00746-9">neural circuits</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07178-6">that support it</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-022-01197-0">and how these circuits can deteriorate</a> due to disease or external factors like inequality – all to better support those affected by these challenges.</p>

<p><strong>Power of first impressions</strong></p>

<p>Previous research revealed that human adults and preschoolers alike can <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1110589">accurately predict election outcomes</a> after <a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0705435104">quick exposure to candidate photos</a>. Plenty of evidence supports the idea that our primitive brain drives us to quickly form first impressions based on physical appearance – it was key to survival, after all.</p>

<p>But researchers don't yet understand why this bias persists. New research with rhesus macaques has provided some answers.</p>

<p>In the study, which is under review at the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.09.17.613526">we showed monkeys pairs of candidate photos</a> from U.S. gubernatorial and senatorial elections, and they correctly predicted the outcomes based solely on visual features.</p>

<p>Specifically, the monkeys spent more time looking at the loser than the winner. This “gaze bias” predicted not only the election outcomes but also the candidates' vote share. Monkeys tended to look at the candidates with more masculine facial features – and these were the candidates more likely to win in the real elections. Jaw prominence had a direct relationship with vote share.</p>

<p><a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2013.03.022">Previous research</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2005.01.044">helps explain the monkeys' gaze bias</a>. When monkeys were shown pictures of unfamiliar but powerful male monkeys, they would only glance briefly at them, presumably because monkeys interpret staring as a sign of aggression. But their gaze lingered when shown a low-status male monkey or a female.</p>

<p>Those preferences were on full display when we showed the macaques photos from the most recent races involving Donald Trump. Their gaze bias, driven by primitive instincts, indicated the winners. The monkeys looked the longest at the Democratic opponent in the contest between Trump and Hillary Clinton. There was less of a gaze bias in the matchup with Joe Biden. And the monkeys looked for about the same amount of time at Trump as at Harris. That means among the three most recent Democratic candidates, based solely on visual features, the monkeys predicted Harris stands the best chance of winning against Trump.</p>

<p><strong>An evolutionary hangover</strong></p>

<p>Our findings suggest that voters instinctively react to cues of physical strength – <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-018-06987-4">cues that are equally evident</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10764-019-00104-y">to our monkey relatives</a>. This “evolutionary hangover” illustrates how traits and behaviors that were once essential for survival persist even when they are no longer relevant.</p>

<p>The macaques' ability to predict winners based on physical attributes alone challenges the notion that humans have evolved beyond superficial judgments in leadership selection. For those who pride themselves on rational decision-making, especially in vital decisions like voting, it's a startling discovery.</p>

<p>Clearly people's choices are not based solely on visual cues. But the evidence suggests that such factors could be more influential than you think. When you enter the voting booth, part of your brain might be drawing on ancient instincts, subconsciously evaluating who looks like they could best lead the tribe.</p>

<p><strong>Staying rational, not primal</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/this-is-your-brain-on-decision-making/">Raising awareness</a> of these <a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0806761106">primal preferences</a> is the first step in <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescoachescouncil/2017/10/18/look-before-you-leap-17-ways-to-slow-down-impulsive-decisions/">reducing their influence</a>.</p>

<p>Political campaigns already tap into these instincts by highlighting a candidate's physical strength and assertiveness. As voters, we can counteract their efforts by leaning into our rational brain's capacity to understand and assess their policies and experience – something our primitive ancestors couldn't do.</p>

<p>Techniques for choosing rationally rather than instinctively include exposing yourself to diverse perspectives, actively questioning your assumptions and considering the long-term outcomes of policies. Such deliberate steps toward making informed decisions take on new importance when you understand how your brain can be swayed at the ballot box by outdated preferences.</p>

<p>Of course, voters are not macaques. But the underlying instincts people share with our primate relatives could still subtly shape our decisions.</p>

<p>Acknowledging the role of these ancient cues can help people become more intentional in how they exercise their power in the voting booth. As democracy evolves, so too should humans' understanding of how to engage with it.<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With only a day left for the US presidential election, Republican nominee Donald Trump has once again come under the scanner for not paying bills after conducting his mega political rallies. When Trump returned to Albuquerque, New Mexico, for the first time in five years to conduct a rally last week, Democrat Mayor Tim Keller demanded that the Republican leader clear his previous dues. Keller took to his official social media handle and took a jab at Trump while posting an image of a skeleton working on a laptop, implying it had been several years of waiting for the Republican leader to clear his longstanding dues.</p>

<p>"Still waiting for Trump to pay the half million he owes. Maybe he's making a special Halloween delivery to the Duke City? We won't hold our breath," Keller posted on X (formerly Twitter), which invited cheeky responses from the netizens.</p>

<p></p>

<p>According to the city of Albuquerque, Trump left an unpaid bill of $211,176 in public safety costs in 2019 when he conducted a rally at the Santa Ana Star Center in Rio Rancho, which is a part of the Albuquerque metropolitan area.</p>

<p>The amount had since swelled to $444,986 including interest over the years. The mayor's office stated that police officers, first responders and other city employees who assisted with the rally, worked a combined overtime of 1,500 hours that night for the rally, which had not been compensated so far.</p>

<p>Last month, a report in <em>NBC</em> claimed that Mr Trump owed at least five cities, including those in the swing state of Pennsylvania, more than $750,000 for campaign events since 2016. Quizzed about the mounting dues, the Trump campaign said questions "related to local law enforcement and first responder costs should be directed to US Secret Service".</p>

<h2><strong>US election</strong></h2>

<p>After months of intense and bitter poll campaigning, America goes to polls on Tuesday (Nov 5). As per <em>AtlasIntel's </em>latest poll, Mr Trump is leading Kamala Harris in all the seven swing states. In Arizona, Trump holds his widest margin - with a 51.9 per cent to 45.1 per cent lead over Harris.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in Nevada, 51.4 per cent of voters chose Trump while 45.9 per cent opted for Harris. Despite the lead in polls, experts believe that the final election outcome might be much closer than anticipated.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United States is hours away from going out to cast the ballot. Democratic nominee Kamala Harris and Republican candidate Donald Trump have been tirelessly campaigning for the past few months, reaching out to voters and presenting their case. &nbsp;</p>

<p>This time, nearly 95 per cent of registered voters live in areas where paper ballots will be the primary way to vote.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Here's a breakdown of how votes are cast and counted in the US elections.</strong></p>

<p><strong>How US Elections Are Organised</strong></p>

<p>Unlike many countries with centralised election bodies, the US has a highly decentralised election system. While the Federal Election Commission oversees campaign finance laws, state and local authorities manage the election process. Each state sets its election regulations, from voter eligibility to ballot design and counting procedures. Thus, voting and vote-counting processes can vary widely across the country.</p>

<p><strong>Voting Methods In The 2024 Elections</strong></p>

<p>Voters in the US cast their ballots through three primary methods:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Handmarked Paper Ballots: The most common method, used by 69.9 per cent of voters, involves marking paper ballots by hand.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Ballot Marking Devices (BMDs): Used by 25.1 per cent of voters, BMDs are computerised systems that allow voters to select options on a screen, and then print a paper ballot to confirm their choices. This method, implemented under the Help America Vote Act (HAVA), includes accessibility features for individuals with disabilities.</li>
	<li>Direct Recording Electronic (DRE) Systems: This electronic method, similar to India's EVMs, stores votes electronically without a paper trail. DRE use has declined sharply due to security concerns, with only 5 per cent of voters relying on these systems in Louisiana and Nevada.</li>
</ul>

<p>The 2000 election, marked by the infamous "butterfly ballot" issues in Florida, stressed the need for ballot clarity and led to an initial shift toward electronic voting. Security concerns - especially following reports of interference in the 2016 election - marked a return to paper-based systems. Today, electronic voting is limited, with most jurisdictions relying on hand-marked ballots or BMDs.</p>

<p><strong>How Votes Are Counted</strong></p>

<p>Votes cast on hand-marked paper ballots and BMDs are typically scanned using optical scanners that automatically record and tabulate results. This process is followed by a state-level audit, which may include machine-assisted or manual verification. States have different timelines for certifying results, with the final official vote tally required by December 11 this year.</p>

<p><strong>In-Person Votes</strong></p>

<p>Votes cast on Election Day or during early voting are counted after the polls close. Paper ballots are sent to counting centres, while digital voting machine data is transmitted electronically or hand-delivered for processing.</p>

<p><strong>Mail-In Ballots</strong></p>

<p>Mail-in ballot processing and counting rules vary by state. Many states allow officials to verify ballots before Election Day, but counting often begins on Election Day, with results held until after polls close.</p>

<p><strong>Verification Of Mail-In Ballots</strong></p>

<p>Every state requires a signature on mail-in ballots. Many use signature matching, and some require additional verification, such as a witness signature or notarisation depending on the state's rules.</p>

<p><strong>Ballot Curing</strong></p>

<p>In states allowing ballot curing, voters can fix errors, like mismatched signatures, to ensure their ballot is counted. Some states require curing by Election Day, while others allow it after. Eight states do not allow ballot curing.</p>

<p><strong>Provisional Ballots</strong></p>

<p>Provisional ballots are used if voter eligibility is uncertain, and they are hand-counted after verification. Military and overseas ballots also add to the timeline due to their verification requirements.</p>

<p><strong>The Electoral College&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>The US President is chosen by 538 electors representing all states and the District of Columbia, based on each state's population. Except in Maine and Nebraska, each state operates under a "winner-take-all" system, awarding all its electoral votes to the candidate who wins the popular vote in that state. To win, a candidate must secure at least 270 electoral votes.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Certification And Inauguration</strong></p>

<p>On January 6, a joint session of Congress, presided over by the Vice President, counted the electoral votes. If a candidate reaches 270 votes, they are declared the President-elect, even if they lost the national popular vote. Inauguration takes place on January 20, when the President-elect is sworn into office for a four-year term.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cassius, the world's largest known crocodile in captivity, has died in a Queensland wildlife sanctuary in Australia. The massive saltwater crocodile, nearly 5.5 metres (18 feet) in length and weighing close to one tonne, was estimated to be over 110 years old, although his exact age remained unknown, according to a report in the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyvzyyd6l7o" rel="nofollow,noindex">BBC</a>.</p>

<p>Cassius lived at the Marineland Melanesia Crocodile Habitat on Green Island since being captured in Australia's Northern Territory during the 1980s.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/marinelandgreenisland" rel="nofollow,noindex">post on Facebook</a>, Marineland Melanesia paid tribute to Cassius, describing him as “our beloved mate” and “a cherished member of our family.”</p>

<p>The post read, “It is with deep sadness that we share the passing of our beloved mate Cassius. He was more than just a crocodile, he was a cherished member of our family and brought joy and companionship to his best mate George for over 37 years. George had only recently relocated into Cairns from Marineland after 52 years living on Green Island to an assisted care residence on the 5th of October.”</p>

<p>“Cassius's condition declined since the 15th of October. He was very old and believed to be living beyond the years of a wild Croc. Cassius will be deeply missed, but our love and memories of him will remain in our hearts forever. Thank you to everyone who visited Cassius throughout his life and offered kindness along the way. Please be advised that we may be operating in a limited capacity over the next few days and we apologise for any inconvenience this may cause,” they concluded.</p>

<p>Cassius's life in the wild was filled with adventure. The crocodile was known for hunting cattle and even damaging boat propellers before his eventual capture. The sanctuary's founder, George Craig, bought him in 1987, bringing him to his new home on Green Island.</p>

<p>Known for his immense size, Cassius earned the <a href="https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/largest-crocodile-in-captivity" rel="nofollow,noindex">Guinness World Record</a> in 2011 as the largest captive crocodile. According to the Guinness World Record, “Cassius, an Australian saltwater crocodile (Crocodylus porosus), is the largest crocodile in captivity at 5.48 m (17 ft 11.75 in). The Australian saltwater crocodile is the largest and most fearsome of today's species. Specimens can live for more than 100 years, can grow to 7 m (23 ft) and weigh more than 1 tonne (1.1 ton).”</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[In an ad for Kamala Harris, a woman marks her ballot for the Democratic candidate while her husband thinks she's voting for Republican Donald Trump.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In an ad for Kamala Harris, a woman marks her ballot for the Democratic candidate while her husband thinks she's voting for Republican Donald Trump: "What happens in the booth, stays in the booth" a voiceover says.</p>

<p>The 30-second-clip, narrated by actor Julia Roberts, shows the couple arriving at a polling station wearing baseball caps featuring the American flag, a symbol often sported by Trump supporters.</p>

<p>The ad, financed by a religious nonprofit, has elicited fury in the Trump camp, with the former president calling it "stupid" and asking "Can you imagine a wife not telling her husband who she's voting for?"</p>

<p>In the ad, the wife exchanges knowing glances with another female voter, before filling in her choice for Harris.</p>

<p>"You can vote any way you want, and no one will ever know," the voiceover says, before the husband asks "Did you make the right choice?"</p>

<p>"Sure did, honey," the woman replies.</p>

<p><strong>Unprecedented gender gap</strong></p>

<p>On conservative Fox News, a host recently said his wife secretly voting for Harris would be "the same thing as having an affair," while former Republican House speaker Newt Gingrich said the Harris spot was an example of the depth of her camp's "corruption."</p>

<p>Anti-Trump political group The Lincoln Project aired a similar ad showing two upper-middle class men who assure each other their wives are voting for Trump. The women -- and other females at the voting precinct -- then fill in their ballots for Harris.</p>

<p>The videos, and the furious reaction from Trump supporters, illustrate two key facets of the US presidential campaign.</p>

<p>One is that Trump and Harris are truly fighting for every last vote, in what is perhaps the most down-to-the-wire presidential race in modern US history.</p>

<p>The other is that Harris is counting heavily on mobilizing women in the ultra-tight race that will see a gender gap in votes like never before.</p>

<p>According to a latest poll by NBC, there is a 34-percentage point difference between male and female intended voters.</p>

<p>Harris has a 16-point lead among women while Trump has an 18-point lead among men.</p>

<p>The unprecedented gap comes with Harris's campaign having leaned heavily on reproductive and abortion rights, following the Supreme Court strike-down of the federal right to the procedure in 2022.</p>

<p><strong>Clooney surprise</strong></p>

<p>More broadly, the election is a clash between the "traditional and kind of patriarchal masculinity" espoused by Trump and Harris's policies which are "less aligned with stereotypical gender roles," said Kelly Dittmar, a political science professor at Rutgers University.</p>

<p>Former Republican congresswoman Liz Cheney, who has stumped for Harris, is openly betting on "secret" votes for the Democrat.</p>

<p>"I think you're going to have, frankly, a lot of men and women who will go into the voting booth and will vote their conscience and will vote for Vice President Harris," said Cheney, who is the daughter of former vice president Dick Cheney.</p>

<p>"They may not ever say anything publicly but the results will speak for themselves," she said.</p>

<p>Former first lady Michelle Obama recently hammered home the point, reminding the female electorate: "If you are a woman who lives in a household of men that don't listen to you or value your opinion, just remember that your vote is a private matter."</p>

<p>The Harris campaign's quest for "secret" voters doesn't stop with women. The group that funded the Julia Roberts-narrated ad, Vote Common Good, recently released a second spot, this time featuring two male voters casting their ballots for her without telling their Trump-supporting buddies.</p>

<p>The ad is narrated by another star, George Clooney.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the date for the US presidential election nears, the race between Democratic nominee Kamala Harris and her Republican counterpart Donald Trump has heated up. Even though American citizens prepare to cast their votes on November 5, the electoral journey began many months ago, and it involves a complex process.</p>

<p><strong>Early preparations</strong></p>

<p>A year before the election, candidates from the two main political parties, the Democrats and Republicans, start their campaigns. They assemble teams, launch fundraising initiatives and embark on nationwide tours to garner support.</p>

<p><strong>Campaign kick-off</strong></p>

<p>As campaigns ramp up, candidates engage in televised debates, which serve as a platform to articulate their policies and defend positions on various issues.</p>

<p><strong>Election process</strong></p>

<p>The US presidential election process can seem overwhelming, with terms like ‘Electoral College,' ‘National Conventions,' ‘Primary' and ‘Caucus' often confusing. Let's understand them better first:</p>

<p><strong>Here's what they mean:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Primaries: Primaries allow party members to vote for their preferred candidate in a secret ballot, similar to a general election. The results determine the allocation of delegates who will support candidates at the national conventions.</li>
	<li>Caucuses: Caucuses involve party members gathering to discuss and publicly vote for their preferred candidate. This interactive process also impacts the number of delegates each candidate receives for the conventions.</li>
	<li>National Conventions: National conventions are important for each political party. Delegates endorse their chosen candidates, leading to the official announcement of the presidential nominee. The selected candidate also names their Vice President or running mate.</li>
	<li>Electoral College: The Electoral College is a mechanism through which electors from each state cast their votes to elect the President. Each state is allocated a specific number of electors based on its Congressional representation, totalling 538 electors nationwide. After the general election, each elector casts one vote, with a majority of 270 needed to win.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Here's a breakdown of the election timeline:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Spring of the year before the election: Candidates announce their intentions to run, starting their campaigns. They officially register with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) to run for president.</li>
	<li>Summer of the year before the election to spring of election year: Primary and Caucus debates are held across the country.</li>
	<li>January to June of election year: States and political parties conduct presidential Primaries and Caucuses, allowing voters to express their preferences for candidates.</li>
	<li>July to early September: Each party hosts nominating conventions to select their presidential candidates. It is during these conventions that the chosen presidential candidates usually announce their Vice-Presidential nominees.</li>
	<li>September and October: Candidates participate in a series of presidential debates, providing voters with an opportunity to assess their stance on issues and policies they will work on, should they get elected.</li>
	<li>Early November: The voting takes place on the first Tuesday of November in the election year.</li>
	<li>December: Members of the Electoral College cast their votes for president, finalising the nation's leader.</li>
	<li>Early January of the next calendar year: Congress officially counts the electoral votes, confirming the results.</li>
	<li>January 20: On Presidential Inauguration Day, the newly elected president is sworn in.</li>
</ul>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kamala Harris will watch Tuesday's election night from the campus of Howard University -- her alma mater -- a fitting place for possibly the most significant night of her life.</p>

<p>Nicknamed "the Black Harvard," the Washington school occupies a central role in the US vice president's biography: Since graduating there in 1986, she has frequently returned at key moments.</p>

<p>"Howard University is one of the most important aspects of my life," she said in 2019 as a candidate in the Democratic presidential primaries, "and it is where I first ran for my first elected office," as a student council representative.</p>

<p>"So this is where it all began."</p>

<p>Her presence there Tuesday night -- when Harris could become the first Black woman to be elected US president -- is thus deeply symbolic.</p>

<p>The US Congress founded Howard in 1867, two years after the Civil War had put an end to slavery in the mostly Southern states where it remained legal.</p>

<p>The school took its name from Oliver Howard, a Northerner known as "the Christian general" who had promoted higher education for freed slaves.</p>

<p>Howard has built a reputation as one of the best of the roughly 100 institutions known as Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), which draw mostly Black and minority students.</p>

<p>The campus of Howard, which has around 11,000 students, features several imposing red-brick buildings with traditional white columns arrayed around a large central lawn commonly known as The Yard.</p>

<p>It was in an amphitheater there that, in mid-August, Kamala Harris prepared for her lone debate against Republican rival Donald Trump -- telling students that someday, "you might be running for president of the United States."</p>

<p><strong>Celebrity graduates</strong></p>

<p>Among Howard's most illustrious graduates have been author and Nobel laureate Toni Morrison, and famed civil rights leader Thurgood Marshall, who in 1967 became the first Black justice appointed to the US Supreme Court.</p>

<p>It was Marshall's example, Harris later said, that inspired the future lawyer to choose Howard for her university studies in 1982.</p>

<p>There she joined the debate club and took part in anti-apartheid demonstrations.</p>

<p>She also joined Alpha Kappa Alpha (AKA), one of the nation's largest sororities, founded at Howard in 1908.</p>

<p>AKA makes no presidential endorsements, but its national membership of some 300,000 has given Harris a far-reaching network of activist supporters.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[While carbon dioxide (CO2) is the best-known greenhouse gas, several others, including methane and nitrous oxide, are also driving global warming and altering the Earth's climate.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While carbon dioxide, or CO2, is the best known greenhouse gas, several others, including methane and nitrous oxide, are also driving global warming and altering the Earth's climate.</p>

<p>Atmospheric concentrations of all three hit new highs in 2023, locking in future temperature increases for years to come, the World Meteorological Organization reported in October.</p>

<p><strong>Methane</strong></p>

<p>CO2 accounts for about two-thirds of the warming attributed to greenhouse gases, said Piers Forster, an expert at the University of Leeds and author of reports by the IPCC, the UN's climate science panel.</p>

<p>Methane, or CH4, is the second most important greenhouse gas linked to human activity after CO2.</p>

<p>Around 40 percent of methane comes from natural sources, notably wetlands, but the majority (around 60 percent) is linked to human activities such as agriculture (ruminant breeding and rice cultivation), fossil fuels and waste.</p>

<p>Its warming power is more than 80 times greater over 20 years than that of CO2, but its lifespan is shorter, making it an important lever in attempts to limit global warming in the short term.</p>

<p>Reducing methane emissions "would have a strong short-term cooling effect, because atmospheric methane concentrations would drop quickly", said Mathijs Harmsen, a researcher at the PBL Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency.</p>

<p>Policies should "focus on capturing the low hanging fruit, so the very low-cost measures such as reducing natural gas leaks", he said.</p>

<p>Despite a global commitment to reduce planet-heating emissions signed by many countries, including the European Union and the United States, the trend is not positive.</p>

<p>"Methane is rising faster in relative terms than any major greenhouse gas and is now 2.6-fold higher than in pre-industrial times," said an international group of researchers under the aegis of the Global Carbon Project, in a study published in the academic journal Environmental Research Letters.</p>

<p><strong>Nitrous oxide</strong></p>

<p>Nitrous oxide, or nitrous protoxide (N2O), is the third major greenhouse gas and almost 300 times more potent than CO2.</p>

<p>It is mainly emitted by synthetic nitrogen fertilisers and manure used in agriculture.</p>

<p>Other emissions come from human activities (the chemical industry, wastewater, fossil fuels) or natural sources (the soil and oceans).</p>

<p>"Global human-induced emissions, which are dominated by nitrogen additions to croplands, increased by 30 percent over the past four decades," concluded a major study in the journal Nature in 2020.</p>

<p>The key to the problem lies in more efficient use of fertilisers.</p>

<p>"Two-thirds of the climate change mitigation potential of N2O could be realised by reducing fertilisers on just 20 percent of the world's cropland, particularly in humid subtropical agricultural regions," wrote French researcher Philippe Ciais in 2021.</p>

<p><strong>Fluorinated gases</strong></p>

<p>Fluorinated greenhouse gases (PFCs, HFCs and SF6) are found in fridges, freezers, heat pumps, air conditioners and electrical networks.</p>

<p>Even when in small quantities, they stand out for their extremely high warming capacity.</p>

<p>For example, SF6, which is found in electrical transformers, has a greenhouse effect 24,000 times greater than CO2 over a 100-year period.</p>

<p>The Montreal Protocol signed in 1987, and ratified by 195 countries, has already significantly reduced the atmospheric presence of CFCs, another ozone-depleting fluorinated gas.</p>

<p>In 2016 the Kigali agreement also provided for the phasing out of HFCs.</p>

<p>And last year the EU sealed a pact to progressively ban the sale of equipment containing fluorinated gases, in particular HFCs, with the aim of eliminating them completely by 2050.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With the UN climate summit to start in Azerbaijan in a week, here is a recap of 10 key dates in the battle against global warming.</p>

<p><strong>1988: key UN body created</strong></p>

<p>Alerted by scientists to signs that the Earth's surface is warming, the United Nations in 1988 establishes the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to investigate.</p>

<p>Two years later, the panel reports that heat-trapping "greenhouse" gases generated by human activity are on the rise and could intensify planetary warming.</p>

<p>In a series of studies, evidence accumulates that human activities -- the burning of coal, oil and gas; logging of rainforests and destructive farming practices -- are heating the Earth's surface, a prelude to disruptions of its climate system.</p>

<p><strong>1992: Earth Summit</strong></p>

<p>A 1992 "Earth Summit" in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, creates the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), with the aim of reducing greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

<p>Since 1995, so-called "Conferences of the Parties", or COPs, have been meeting to pursue that elusive goal.</p>

<p><strong>1997: Kyoto Protocol</strong></p>

<p>In 1997, nations agree in Kyoto, Japan, on a 2008-2012 timeframe for industrialised nations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by an average of 5.2 percent from 1990 levels.</p>

<p>Developing countries, including China, India and Brazil, are not required to take on binding targets.</p>

<p>But in 2001, the United States, at the time the world's biggest carbon emitter, refuses to ratify the protocol, which takes effect in 2005.</p>

<p><strong>2007: Nobel prize</strong></p>

<p>The IPCC reports in 2007 that evidence of global warming is now "unequivocal" and extreme weather events will probably multiply.</p>

<p>In October 2007, the UN panel shares the Nobel Peace Prize with former US vice president Al Gore for their efforts in raising the alarm about climate change.</p>

<p><strong>2009: Copenhagen collapse</strong></p>

<p>Participants at the COP15 gathering in the Danish capital Copenhagen fail to achieve an agreement for the post-2012 period.</p>

<p>Several dozen major emitters, including China and the US, announce a goal of limiting global temperature increases to two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, but are vague on how the goal will be reached.</p>

<p><strong>2015: Paris landmark deal</strong></p>

<p>In December 2015, nearly every nation on Earth commits to limit warming to "well below" two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.</p>

<p>A more ambitious cap of 1.5 Celsius is also adopted in the French capital Paris as the preferred target.</p>

<p><strong>2018: Greta Thunberg</strong></p>

<p>In 2018, Swedish teen Greta Thunberg starts skipping school on Fridays to sit outside the Swedish parliament, demanding more substantive action to combat climate change.</p>

<p>Despite ending her Friday protests in 2023 after graduating, her protest inspires students worldwide to skip class each Friday in a bid to demand more efforts from global leaders.</p>

<p><strong>2022: biodiversity deal</strong></p>

<p>An accord on biodiversity is reached in Montreal, Canada in December 2022, calling for the designation of 30 percent of the planet's land and oceans as protected zones by 2030, and an end of extinctions of threatened species due to human activities.</p>

<p><strong>2023: 'beginning of end' for fossil fuels</strong></p>

<p>The COP28 in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, ends with a landmark deal to transition away from fossil fuels.</p>

<p>EU climate chief Wopke Hoekstra calls the agreement "long, long overdue", saying it has taken nearly 30 years of climate meetings to "arrive at the beginning of the end of fossil fuels".</p>

<p><strong>2024: hottest on record</strong></p>

<p>The 2024 northern summer sees the highest global temperatures ever measured.</p>

<p>The global average temperature in August 2024 at the Earth's surface is 16.82C, according to the EU's climate monitor Copernicus.</p>

<p>This breaks through the level of 1.5C above the pre-industrial average -- the key threshold for limiting the worst effects of climate change.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Indian embassy said "anti-India elements" orchestrated the violence outside a consular camp co-organised by the temple.</p>

<p>Mr Arya said he feels the Khalistani extremists have infiltrated the country's law enforcement agencies besides its political apparatus.</p>

<p>"I begin to feel that there is a small grain of truth in the reports that in addition to Canadian political apparatus, Khalistanis have effectively infiltrated into our law enforcement agencies. No wonder that under the 'freedom of expression' Khalistani extremists are getting a free pass in Canada," read his post, echoing India's accusation that Canada provides a safe haven to terrorists and extremists.</p>

<p>He also called on Hindu-Canadians to step up and asserts their rights and hold politicians accountable for the security and safety of the community.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Trudeau said the violence at the Brampton temple was unacceptable and thanked the local police for swift action.</p>

<p>"The acts of violence at the Hindu Sabha Mandir in Brampton today are unacceptable. Every Canadian has the right to practice their faith freely and safely. Thank you to the Peel Regional Police for swiftly responding to protect the community and investigate this incident," said Trudeau.</p>

<p>The Indian embassy called the violence "deeply disappointing", despite which, it said the consulate was able to issue more than 1,000 life certificates to the Indian and Canadian applicants.</p>

<p>The violence comes amid diplomatic tensions between India and Canada triggered by Trudeau's charges that "Indian agents" were behind the killing of Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar. India had trashed the charges as "baseless".</p>

<p>The central government last month pulled its top diplomats from Canada. The latest statement too raised concerns over its diplomats receiving threats in the country.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A new study has claimed that methane gas might be trapped beneath a 9.7-kilometre-thick distinct crust of Saturn's largest moon, Titan. The research team led by planetary scientists at the University of Hawaii <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.hawaii.edu/news/2024/10/29/saturn-moon-methane/" rel="nofollow, noindex">observed </a>that Titan's impact craters were hundreds of metres shallower than expected and that only 90 of them had been identified. The observations were surprising as based on data from other moons, additional impact craters that are much deeper should have been present on the surface of Titan.</p>

<p>"We realised something unique to Titan must be making them become shallower and disappear relatively quickly," said lead researcher Lauren Schurmeier, adding that the scientists turned to computer modelling to further the investigation.</p>

<p>"Using this modeling approach, we were able to constrain the methane clathrate crust thickness to five to ten kilometres [about 3 to 6 miles] because simulations using that thickness produced crater depths that best matched the observed craters," she added.</p>

<h2><strong>Titan could house life?</strong></h2>

<p>Methane clathrate, or "methane hydrate," is a solid compound in which a large amount of methane is trapped within the crystalline structure of water, creating a solid similar to ice. Scientists are of the view that studying Methane clathrate would help understand Titan's carbon cycle and its changing climate.</p>

<p>The thickness of the methane-rich crust could also suggest that Titan's interior was insulated, making the ice shell very warm and ductile, which implies it was slowly connecting. The convection indicated that&nbsp;biomarkers indicating life may have hoisted from Titan's subsurface ocean and carried to its outer icy shell, just awaiting discovery.</p>

<p>"If life exists in Titan's ocean under the thick ice shell, any signs of life, biomarkers, would need to be transported up Titan's ice shell to where we could more easily access or view them with future missions," Ms. Schurmeier added.</p>

<p>Notably, Earth's methane clathrate hydrates are found in the permafrost of Siberia and below the arctic seafloor.</p>

<p>Titan, the moon of the second-largest planet in our solar system is believed to be one of the most hospitable worlds. It is the only place other than Earth to have an atmosphere and liquids in the form of rivers, lakes and seas on the surface.</p>

<p>Moreover, Titan's nitrogen atmosphere is so dense that a human wouldn't need a pressure suit to walk around on the surface. However, an oxygen mask would be required for protection against frigid cold temperatures that hover around minus 179 Celsius.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[At least six people died after a volcano in eastern Indonesia erupted several times overnight, officials said Monday, raising the alert level to the highest of a four-tiered system.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A volcano in eastern Indonesia erupted overnight, killing at least 10 people as it spewed fireballs and ash on surrounding villages, officials said Monday as they raised the alert status to its highest level.</p>

<p>Mount Lewotobi Laki-Laki, a 1,703-metre (5,587-feet) twin volcano located on the popular tourist island of Flores, erupted shortly before midnight, forcing authorities to evacuate several villages.</p>

<p>Residents described their horror when the crater started to shoot flaming rocks at their homes.</p>

<p>"I was asleep when suddenly the bed shook twice, as if someone had slammed it. Then I realised the volcano had erupted, so I ran outside," said 32-year-old hairdresser Hermanus Mite.</p>

<p>"I saw flames coming out and immediately fled. There were ashes and stones everywhere. My salon also caught fire and everything inside was lost."</p>

<p>Abdul Muhari, spokesman of the country's disaster mitigation agency (BNPB), confirmed the death toll at a press conference, adding that 10,295 people had been affected by the eruptions.</p>

<p>He said the number of evacuees was still being calculated.</p>

<p>Footage received by AFP showed houses near the volcano covered by thick ash, with some areas on fire.</p>

<p>An AFP journalist near the volcano said five villages were evacuated, forcing thousands of people to seek shelter elsewhere.</p>

<p>Some wooden homes caught fire, and the ground was pockmarked with holes caused by flying molten rocks.</p>

<p>The crater erupted just before midnight and then again at 1:27 am (1727 GMT Sunday) and 2:48 am, the country's volcanology agency said.</p>

<p>It hoisted the highest alert level and told locals and tourists not to carry out activities within a seven-kilometre (4.3-mile) radius of the crater.</p>

<p>"There has been a significant increase in volcanic activity on Mount Lewotobi Laki-Laki," it said in a press release Monday.</p>

<p>It released images that showed the roofs of houses collapsed after they were hit by volcanic rocks, and locals sheltering in communal buildings.</p>

<p><strong>Ash rain</strong></p>

<p>The volcanology agency warned there was a potential for rain-induced lava floods and told locals to wear masks to avoid the effects of volcanic ash.</p>

<p>There were a series of eruptions at the volcano last week, the biggest on Thursday, sending a column of ash 2,000 metres (6,500 feet) into the sky.</p>

<p>The mountain had several major eruptions in January, prompting authorities at the time to raise the alert status to the highest level and evacuate at least 2,000 residents.</p>

<p>Indonesia, a vast archipelago nation, experiences frequent eruptions due to its position on the Pacific "Ring of Fire", an area of intense volcanic and seismic activity.</p>

<p>In December last year, an eruption at one of the country's most active volcanoes, Mount Marapi in West Sumatra, killed at least 24 climbers, most of them university students.</p>

<p>And in May, more than 60 people died after heavy rains washed volcanic material from Marapi into residential areas, sweeping away homes.</p>

<p>That month Mount Ruang in North Sulawesi province erupted more than half a dozen times, forcing thousands of residents of nearby islands to evacuate.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former US president Donald Trump is 'clearly the better choice,' as compared to his Democratic rival Vice President Kamala Harris, former US ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley has said.</p>

<p>Haley urged undecided voters to look at both candidates' policy proposals, which she said clearly show Trump as the better option in a Wall Street Journal op-ed published two days before Election Day.</p>

<p>"I don't agree with Trump 100 per cent of the time. But I do agree with him most of the time, and I disagree with Harris nearly all the time. That makes this an easy call. Here are the facts most relevant to me," the former South Carolina governor wrote in an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal on Sunday.</p>

<p>Batting for her former boss, the Indian American wrote; “Will Trump do some things I don't like in a second term? I'm sure he will. If that was the question before voters, then I imagine Trump would lose. But that isn't the question in any election.</p>

<p>"No politician gets everything right. For those of us who are clear-eyed enough to see Trump's flaws and honest enough to acknowledge them, the question is whether we're better off with his policies or his opponent's. On taxes, spending, inflation, immigration, energy and national security, the candidates are miles apart. And Trump is clearly the better choice," she wrote.</p>

<p>Haley alleged that the Biden-Harris agenda has made the world far more dangerous.</p>

<p>"Our southern border is our most pressing security threat; Biden and Harris have made it dramatically worse. Their debacle in Afghanistan not only created a new terrorist state; it also signalled weakness that sparked Russia's war against Ukraine," she wrote.</p>

<p>"Their appeasement of Iran has enriched that despotic regime and emboldened it to pursue war with Israel through its terrorist proxies. And the administration's weakness toward China has done nothing to impede the communist power's expansion at our expense. This is the world that Biden-Harris failures have given us in four short years,” she said.</p>

<p>Haley argued a Trump administration would be different.</p>

<p>"It wouldn't be perfect. But I agree with Trump that we need to keep taxes low and cut them more. I agree that we need to roll back trillions of dollars in special-interest handouts. I agree that we need to expand American energy to empower our families and job creators while making us less dependent on foreign energy," Haley said.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The case dates back to 1990 when Marlene Warren was shot in her home by an assailant dressed as a clown.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Florida woman called “killer clown” has been released from prison after she served a sentence related to the 1990 murder of her husband's former wife.</p>

<p>Sheila Keen-Warren, now 61, walked free on November 2, nearly two years after accepting a plea deal that saw her admit to second-degree murder. According to the Florida Department of Corrections, she was released 18 months following her plea, just before she was due to stand trial.</p>

<p>Though Keen-Warren spent seven years in custody since her 2017 arrest, Florida's sentencing laws in place at the time of the crime allowed her to reduce her time significantly through credits for good behaviour. Consequently, despite her initial 12-year sentence, she was eligible for early release.</p>

<p>“Sheila Keen-Warren will always be an admitted convicted murderer and will wear that stain every day for the rest of her life,” Palm Beach County State Attorney Dave Aronberg said in a statement, according to the <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/03/us-news/floridas-killer-clown-sheila-keen-warren-released-from-prison/" rel="nofollow,noindex">New York Post</a>.</p>

<p>Greg Rosenfeld, Keen-Warren's attorney, said she accepted the plea deal only because it meant she could be released soon, avoiding the risk of a life sentence. “We are thrilled that Ms Keen-Warren has been released from prison and is returning to her family. As we've stated from the beginning, she did not commit this crime,” Mr Rosenfeld reportedly said in a message.</p>

<p>The case dates back to 1990 when Marlene Warren was shot in her home by an assailant dressed as a clown. According to Ms Warren's son, Joseph Ahrens, he and his friends were present when a clown appeared at their door bearing balloons. When Ms Warren&nbsp;opened the door, the clown handed her the balloons and, after she commented, “How nice,” the clown pulled out a gun and shot her in the face before fleeing the scene.</p>

<p>Detectives had suspected Keen-Warren for years, though it wasn't until 2017 that she was arrested, with authorities attributing the delay to advancements in DNA technology that allegedly linked her to the crime. But Mr Rosenfeld, Keen-Warren's attorney, maintained that this evidence was unreliable.&nbsp;He highlighted issues with the DNA evidence, claiming it contained both male and female genes and that one of the samples was common enough that it could have matched many women.</p>

<p>At the time of the shooting, Keen-Warren worked for Michael Warren, Marlene Warren's husband, at his used car dealership. In the years following Ms Warren's death, Keen-Warren married Michael, and the two eventually relocated to Abingdon, Virginia, where they operated a restaurant.</p>

<p>Witnesses from 1990 reportedly told investigators that Keen-Warren&nbsp;and Michael Warren were romantically involved, although both denied it. Some costume shop employees identified Keen-Warren as the woman who bought a clown suit shortly before the killing. One of the balloons held by the clown — a silver one bearing the message, “You're the Greatest” — was traced to a Publix supermarket near Keen-Warren's home, where employees recalled seeing a woman who looked like her buying the balloons an hour before the incident.</p>

<p>The apparent getaway vehicle, a white Chrysler convertible, was found abandoned with strands of orange, hair-like fibres inside. The car was reported stolen from Michael Warren's lot a month before the murder. Keen-Warren and her then-husband had worked in repossession for Michael at the time.</p>

<p>Relatives of Marlene Warren previously said&nbsp;that she had been considering leaving her husband, suspecting him of infidelity. According to the New York Post, she had allegedly told her mother, “If anything happens to me, Mike did it.” Michael Warren has never been charged in connection with her death and denies any involvement.</p>

<p>State Attorney Aronberg acknowledged the challenges posed by the 27-year delay in bringing the case to trial, including the death of key witnesses.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The dollar slipped in Asia on Monday as investors braced for a potentially pivotal week for the global economy as the United States chooses a new leader and, probably, cuts interest rates again with major implications for bond yields.</p>

<p>The euro rose 0.4% to $1.0876 but faces resistance around $1.0905, while the dollar dipped 0.3% on the yen to 152.45 yen. The dollar index eased 0.3% to 103.94.</p>

<p>Democratic candidate Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump remain virtually tied in opinion polls and the winner might not be known for days after voting ends.</p>

<p>Analysts believe Trump's policies on immigration, tax cuts and tariffs would put upward pressure on inflation, bond yields and the dollar, while Harris was seen as the continuity candidate.</p>

<p>Dealers said the early dip in the dollar might be linked to a well-respected poll that showed Harris taking a surprise 3-point lead in Iowa, thanks largely to her popularity with female voters.</p>

<p>"It is widely considered that a Trump win will be positive for the USD, though many feel this outcome has been discounted," said Chris Weston, an analyst at broker Pepperstone. "A Trump presidency with full control of Congress could be most impactful, as one would expect a solid sell-off in Treasuries resulting in a spike higher in the USD."</p>

<p>"A Harris win and a split Congress would likely result in 'Trump trades' quickly reversed and priced out," he added. "The USD, gold, bitcoin and U.S. equity would likely head lower."</p>

<p>Uncertainty over the outcome is one reason markets assume the Federal Reserve will choose to cut rates by a standard 25 basis points on Thursday, rather than repeat its outsized half-point easing.</p>

<p>Futures imply a 99% chance of a quarter-point cut to 4.50%-4.75%, and an 83% probability of a similar-sized move in December.</p>

<p>"We are pencilling in four more consecutive cuts in the first half of 2024 to a terminal rate of 3.25%-3.5%, but see more uncertainty about both the speed next year and the final destination," said Goldman Sachs economist Jan Hatzius.</p>

<p>"Both our baseline and probability-weighted forecasts are now a bit more dovish than market pricing."</p>

<p>The Bank of England also meets Thursday and is expected to cut by 25 basis points, while the Riksbank is seen easing by 50 basis points and the Norges Bank is expected to stay on hold.</p>

<p>The Reserve Bank of Australia holds its meeting on Tuesday and again is expected to hold rates steady.</p>

<p>The BoE's decision has been complicated by a sharp sell-off in gilts following the Labour government's budget last week, which also dragged the pound lower.</p>

<p>Early Monday, sterling had regained some of its losses to stand at $1.2963, some way from last week's trough at $1.2841. [GB/]</p>

<p>More stimulus is also expected from China's National People's Congress, which is meeting from Monday through Friday.</p>

<p>Sources told Reuters last week that Beijing is considering approving next week the issuance of more than 10 trillion yuan ($1.40 trillion) in extra debt in the next few years to revive its fragile economy.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

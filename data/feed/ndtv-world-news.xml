       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Republican Party presidential candidate Donald Trump crowed, "the Corrupt and Radical Democrats are throwing him overboard" after President Joe Biden announced he was dropping out of the race for the White House.</p>

<p>"He was annihilated in an Earth Shattering Debate," Trump posted on Saturday on Truth Social, the X-like social media platform he uses, mangling the capitalisation of his text.</p>

<p>After the June 27 debate in which his performance raised questions about cognitive abilities and his capacity to match Trump's campaign vitality, Biden announced he was dropping out of the race and endorsing Vice-President Kamala Harris to be the Democratic Party candidate.</p>

<p>Trump piled on personal insults and questions about Biden's performance in the post, "Crooked Joe Biden is the Worst President, by far, in the History of our Nation."</p>

<p>"He has done everything possible to destroy our Country, from our Southern Border, to Energy Dominance, National Security, International Standing, and so much more," Trump said repeating his constant refrain.</p>

<p>Trump alleged that "the people around him lied to America about his Complete and Total Mental, Physical, and Cognitive Demise" to prop up Biden.</p>

<p>Trump did not mention Harris, but said, "Whoever the Left puts up now will just be more of the same."</p>

<p>On Saturday at a campaign rally, Trump ridiculed Harris.</p>

<p>He said, "Kamaala, I call her laughing Kamaala. Have you seen her laughing? She is crazy. You can tell a lot by a laugh. She is nuts. She is not as crazy as (former Speaker) Nancy Pelosi."</p>

<p>CNN reported that Trump said that she (Harris) will be easier to defeat than Biden.</p>

<p>Trump's son Donald Trump Jr. fired the opening salvo on his father's behalf, "Kamala Harris owns the entire Left-wing policy record of Joe Biden. The only difference is that she is even more liberal and less competent than Joe, which is really saying something.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Barack Obama praised US President Joe Biden's decision to drop out of the White House race on Sunday, saying it was testament to the US leader's "love of country" -- but warned of "uncharted waters" ahead of the November 5 election.</p>

<p>Biden had "every right" to run for reelection, the former president said in a statement, lauding the 81-year-old's record and calling him a "patriot of the highest order."</p>

<p>"We will be navigating uncharted waters in the days ahead. But I have extraordinary confidence that the leaders of our party will be able to create a process from which an outstanding nominee emerges," he continued.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If a week is a long time in politics, the last eight days of the US presidential campaign have proved a drama of epic proportions.</p>

<p>Joe Biden's shock decision Sunday to drop out of the 2024 presidential race capped a head-spinning week that began with the attempted assassination of Donald Trump, and has left Americans reeling.</p>

<p>Here is how the week unfolded:</p>

<h3><strong>Saturday: Trump assassination bid</strong></h3>

<p>Republican candidate Donald Trump survives an assassination attempt during a campaign rally in Pennsylvania, when a 20-year-old on a nearby rooftop opened fire.</p>

<p>Pictures of the bloodied candidate defiantly shaking his fist as Secret Service agents rush him from the stage become iconic, galvanizing his supporters.</p>

<h3><strong>Monday: Republican National Convention begins</strong></h3>

<p>Trump appears before a roaring crowd at the Republican National Convention, his ear -- wounded in the assassination attempt -- covered by a white bandage. He names Ohio Senator J.D. Vance as his running mate.</p>

<h3><strong>Wednesday: Pressure on Biden increases</strong></h3>

<p>Biden's support continues to ebb following his disastrous June 27 debate with Trump, as Democratic fears grow over the 81-year-old's age and ability to beat Trump at the polls -- then serve another four years.</p>

<p>A top Democratic lawmaker, Adam Schiff, joins a fast-growing list of party officials urging the president to step aside, praising him but saying "our nation is at a crossroads."</p>

<p>Biden is also diagnosed with Covid, forced to step off the campaign trail and retreat to his Delaware home to recover.</p>

<p>In an interview released the same day, he says he could reconsider his election bid if a "medical condition" emerged.</p>

<h3><strong>Thursday: Pelosi, Obama, Trump</strong></h3>

<p>New signs of waning Democrat support emerge: Former House speaker Nancy Pelosi, who had worked to resolve the growing crisis, is said to tell House Democrats the president might be persuaded soon to exit the race.</p>

<p>And Barack Obama, the former president who was once Biden's boss, reportedly tells allies the president should "seriously consider the viability of his candidacy."</p>

<p>In Milwaukee, Trump accepts his nomination at the Republican National Convention, promising an enraptured crowd they can expect an "incredible victory" in November.</p>

<h3><strong>Friday: 'Stakes are high'</strong></h3>

<p>With the list of lawmakers urging Biden to drop out reaching 25, he again insists he will stay in the race, saying, "The stakes are high, and the choice is clear. Together, we will win."</p>

<h3><strong>Saturday: 'Bullet for democracy'</strong></h3>

<p>In his first rally since the attempted assassination, Trump tells a rapt crowd in swing state Michigan "I took a bullet for democracy."</p>

<p>He mocks Democrats' leadership crisis, saying, "They have no idea who their candidate is."</p>

<h3><strong>Sunday: Biden's big decision</strong></h3>

<p>Sunday begins with key Senator Joe Manchin, a Democrat-aligned independent, joining the chorus urging Biden to step aside.</p>

<p>Two polls bring grim news for the president, one showing sharply dropping support in battleground state Michigan, the other showing Trump enjoying his highest favorability ratings in years.</p>

<p>At 1.46 pm Washington time (1746 GMT) Biden posts a stunning statement on social media announcing he is ending his candidacy, saying it is "in the best interest of my party and the country."</p>

<p>He endorses Vice President Kamala Harris as the party's new nominee, as top Democrats such as Bill and Hillary Clinton echo their support.</p>

<p>Trump declares on social media that Biden was "not fit to run" and "is certainly not fit to serve." Republicans including House Speaker Mike Johnson insists that Biden "must resign" as president "immediately."</p>

<p>The Democratic Party chairman announces there will be a "transparent and orderly" to pick someone to run in Biden's place.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many Democrats on Sunday quickly backed Vice President Kamala Harris to run as the party's presidential nominee against Donald Trump after incumbent President Joe Biden's abrupt departure from the race, but some powerful party members, including former House of Representatives speaker Nancy Pelosi, stayed quiet. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>After weeks of in-party fighting between Democrats on whether Biden, 81, should stay in the race, a rush of support coalescing behind her is crucial just over 100 days before November's election.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, there are plenty of doubts inside the Democratic Party about whether Harris can beat Trump in November.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Biden himself endorsed Harris on Sunday, not in his initial letter stepping down, but in a separate statement. He was quickly followed by the powerful Congressional Black Caucus, several key donors, lawmakers including U.S. Senator Patty Murray, and super PACs including Priorities USA and Unite the Country.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Today I want to offer my full support and endorsement for Kamala to be the nominee of our party this year," Biden said on social media platform X. "Democrats - it's time to come together and beat Trump. Let's do this."</p>

<p>Dmitri Mehlhorn, an adviser to Reid Hoffman, the LinkedIn founder and a major Democratic donor, called Harris "the American dream personified," noting she was the daughter of immigrants. "She is also toughness personified, rising from my home town of Oakland California to become the top prosecutor of the state. With Scranton Joe stepping back, I cannot wait to help elect President Harris."</p>

<p>Still, others including Pelosi thanked Biden for his patriotism but did not yet throw their support behind Harris or any other candidate.&nbsp;</p>

<p>U.S. Senator Peter Welch, the first Democratic senator to call on Biden to drop his reelection run, called for an open process to nominate Harris.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Democrats should have "an open process so that whoever our nominee is, including Kamala, has the strength of having a process that shows the consensus position of the party," he said. "The debate in the Democratic Party is who can carry on the legacy of President Biden and defeat Trump."<br />

       <description><![CDATA[Joe Biden's withdrawal from the race for the White House leaves a gap atop the Democratic presidential ticket that the party is now rushing to fill.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Joe Biden's withdrawal from the race for the White House leaves a gap atop the Democratic presidential ticket that the party is now rushing to fill.</p>

<p>Here is a look at potential replacements:</p>

<h3><strong>Kamala Harris</strong></h3>

<p>She seems like the obvious choice, and Biden has given her his endorsement.</p>

<p>US Vice President Kamala Harris, who has been a heartbeat away from the Oval Office since Biden's January 2021 swearing in, is well positioned to be the Democratic Party's standard-bearer.</p>

<p>The 59-year-old Harris, the daughter of a Jamaican father and an Indian mother, is a trailblazer.</p>

<p>She was the first Black person and the first woman to serve as California's attorney general, and then was the first US senator of South Asian descent.</p>

<p>She is now the first woman and first Black vice president.</p>

<p>During her career as a prosecutor, Harris had a reputation for being tough -- a trait she could use to advantage in a campaign expected to focus on crime and immigration.</p>

<p>But some progressive Democrats have been critical of her strict punishment of minor offenders, saying it disproportionately affected minorities.</p>

<p>Harris also suffers from a dismal approval rating, which could prompt Democrats to find another solution.</p>

<h3><strong>Gavin Newsom</strong></h3>

<p>There is no rule that a running mate automatically replaces the presidential candidate in the case of a withdrawal. This is why California Governor Gavin Newsom's name keeps popping up.</p>

<p>The 56-year-old Democrat, a former mayor of San Francisco, has been at the helm of the Golden State -- the most populous in the United States -- for five years, and has made it a haven for abortion access.</p>

<p>Newsom steadfastly supported Biden and dismissed talk of replacing him prior to the Democrat's withdrawal, but he has also made little secret of his own presidential ambitions.</p>

<p>In recent months, he has increased his international travel, run multiple ads touting his record, and invested millions of dollars in a political action committee, fueling speculation that he will run in 2028. So why not 2024?</p>

<h3><strong>Gretchen Whitmer</strong></h3>

<p>Another possible Democratic candidate is Gretchen Whitmer, the 52-year-old governor of Michigan.</p>

<p>Her state has both a strong working-class population and major Black and Arab American communities -- all key groups of voters that Biden struggled to court.</p>

<p>Whitmer, a fierce critic of Trump, is perhaps best known for being the intended target of a kidnapping plot devised by a far-right militia group.</p>

<p>Michigan will be one of the crucial battleground states in the November 5 presidential election -- a strong argument, according to her supporters, for naming Whitmer as a candidate.</p>

<h3><strong>Josh Shapiro</strong></h3>

<p>Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro leads the biggest swing state in November's race.</p>

<p>The 51-year-old, who was elected in November 2022 with a convincing victory over a conservative rival and took office in early 2023, previously was elected twice as the state's attorney general.</p>

<p>He condemned Catholic priests who had sexually abused thousands of children and prosecuted Purdue Pharma, the maker of the powerful opioid painkiller OxyContin.</p>

<p>Shapiro is an effective speechmaker and an avowed centrist -- qualities that could propel him to national office.</p>

<h3><strong>The rest</strong></h3>

<p>Other names circulating include Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, Maryland Governor Wes Moore and Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear, but their chances so far seem limited at best.</p>

<p>Senator Amy Klobuchar and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, who both ran against Biden in the 2020 primaries, have also been mentioned.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Following are some reactions from abroad to U.S. President Joe Biden's decision on Sunday to pull out of his campaign to seek reelection in November:</p>

<h3><strong>BRITISH PRIME MINISTER KEIR STARMER:</strong></h3>

<p>"I respect President Biden's decision and I look forward to us working together during the remainder of his presidency," Starmer said in a statement.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I know that, as he has done throughout his remarkable career, President Biden will have made his decision based on what he believes is in the best interests of the American people."</p>

<h3><strong>IRISH TAOISEACH SIMON HARRIS ON &nbsp;X:</strong></h3>

<p>"On behalf of the people and government of Ireland. I, as Taoiseach, would like to thank you Mr President for your global leadership and your friendship as you make your announcement that you will not stand in the 2024 US Presidential election.</p>

<p>"The world has changed since President Biden's victory in 2020 and we have had to face extraordinary challenges from a global pandemic to the return of war to the continent of Europe with the horrific full- scale invasion of Ukraine by Russia which has deliberately targeted and killed innocent civilians.</p>

<p>"President Biden has been a voice for reason, effective multilateralism and shared solutions."</p>

<h3><strong>KREMLIN SPOKESMAN DMITRY PESKOV speaking to SHOT news outlet:</strong></h3>

<p>"The elections are still four months away, and that is a long period of time in which a lot can change. We need to be patient and carefully monitor what happens. The priority for us is the special military operation," Peskov said, referring to the war in Ukraine.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>NORWEGIAN PRIME MINISTER JONAS GAHR STOERE:</strong></h3>

<p>"I respect Joe Biden's decision not to run for re-election. That justification deserves respect," Stoere told national broadcaster NRK.</p>

<p>"Biden has been one of America's most prominent politicians over several decades, and a president who has carried out several important reforms."&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>POLISH PRIME MINISTER DONALD TUSK ON X:&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>"Mr. President @JoeBiden, many times you have made difficult decisions that have made Poland, America, and the world safer, and democracy and freedom stronger. I know that you were guided by the same principles when announcing your latest decision. Perhaps the most difficult one in your life."</p>

<h3><strong>CZECH PRIME MINISTER PETR FIALA ON X:&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>"It is undoubtedly the decision of a statesman who has served his country for decades. It is a responsible and personally difficult step, but it is all the more valuable. I am keeping my fingers crossed for the USA that a good president emerges from the democratic competition of two strong and equal candidates."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former president Donald Trump on Sunday reacted to Joe Biden ending his reelection bid, claiming the incumbent president is "certainly not fit to serve."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Biden announced that he was withdrawing from the race to be the next president, following mounting pressure from Democrats after a faltering debate performance against Republican candidate Trump last month.</p>

<p>Biden has endorsed Kamala Harris, the current vice-president, to be the new Democratic nominee.</p>

<p>"Crooked Joe Biden was not fit to run for President, and is certainly not fit to serve - And never was! He only attained the position of President by lies, Fake News, and not leaving his Basement.</p>

<p>"All those around him, including his Doctor and the Media, knew that he wasn't capable of being President, and he wasn't," Trump posted on Truth Social.</p>

<p>Trump, 78, added, "We will suffer greatly because of his presidency, but we will remedy the damage he has done very quickly. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!" In a phone call with CNN minutes after Biden, 81, announced his exit from the 2024 race, Trump described Biden as going "down as the single worst president by far in the history of our country." Meanwhile, Trump's son, Donald Trump Jr., also attacked Kamala Harris as "even more liberal and less competent" than Biden.</p>

<p>Donald Trump Jr. attacked Vice President Harris, who President Biden endorsed for the Democratic nomination after stepping down, as "even more liberal and less competent" than Biden.</p>

<p>"Kamala Harris owns the entire leftwing policy record of Joe Biden. The only difference is that she is even more liberal and less competent than Joe, which is really saying something. She was put in charge of the border and we saw the worst invasion of illegals in our history!!!" Trump Jr. said.</p>

<p>Former president Donald Trump, told CNN earlier that he thinks Harris will be easier to defeat than Biden would have been in the November 5 presidential election.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced Sunday that a negotiating team would be sent this week for new talks on a deal to free hostages held by operatives in Gaza.</p>

<p>Netanyahu said the team would leave Thursday -- the day after he gives a speech to the United States Congress -- but he did not say where they would go.</p>

<p>Qatar and Egypt, with US support, have been mediating indirect talks between Israel and Hamas, which holds the hostages and has been at war with Israel for more than nine months.</p>

<p>International mediators have been trying for months to seal an accord between Israel and Hamas. A deal would involve a six-week ceasefire during which some hostages seized by Hamas would be exchanged for Palestinians held in Israeli prisons.</p>

<p>"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today held an in-depth discussion on the issue of the hostages with the negotiation team and senior security officials," said a brief statement released by his office.</p>

<p>Netanyahu, who says he will meet US President Joe Biden in Washington on Tuesday, the day before a speech before Congress, "ordered the negotiating team to leave on Thursday," it added.</p>

<p>Israel's Defence Minister Yoav Gallant indicated that a deal could be reached.</p>

<p>"As a result of our military achievements during this war, the conditions have been created and a limited window of opportunity has opened to establish a framework for the release of the hostages," he said in a statement.</p>

<p>"The defence establishment backs you in your mission to bring about an agreement."</p>

<p>David Barnea, the head of Israel's Mossad intelligence agency, has twice been to Qatar in recent weeks for talks that fuelled the hopes of the families of the hostages that an accord could be close.</p>

<p>Netanyahu has repeatedly vowed to eradicate Hamas as well as bring home all the hostages. Far-right members of his governing coalition oppose a truce deal.</p>

<p>Hamas officials, whose October 7 attack on Israel triggered the war, have accused the prime minister of obstructing prospects for a ceasefire.</p>

<p>Demonstrators in Israel, who have taken to the streets sometimes in the tens of thousands to demand new elections and a hostage-release deal, also accuse Netanyahu of prolonging the war.</p>

<p>US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Friday that he believed "we're inside the 10 yard line and driving toward the goal line" for a ceasefire deal.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Joe Biden wanted to save the "soul of America" from Donald Trump, but his stubborn defiance of the march of time may have cleared his rival's path back to power.</p>

<p>Biden caved in to growing pressure Sunday and announced he is dropping out of the presidential race, amid concerns over his mental acuity and ability to beat Trump and serve four more years.</p>

<p>As he fought for his political survival after a disastrous debate, the 81-year-old Democrat repeatedly cited his family's mantra that "when you get knocked down, get back up again."</p>

<p>From playground punch-ups to a stutter to terrible family tragedies, Biden had long seen his life story as a series of comebacks against impossible odds.</p>

<p>And it was his triumph four years ago against Trump that convinced Biden that, despite being the oldest president in US history, he was the only one who could do it again -- until he threw in the towel on Sunday.</p>

<p>Overcoming his reputation as a gaffe machine, Biden initially lived up to his goal as a "unifier in chief" after the Trump years and the shock of the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol.</p>

<p>But the question of his age always loomed large.</p>

<p>Biden eventually joked about it but always denied it was an issue, even after a debate where his rambling answers and listless stare sparked a revolt by Democrats.</p>

<p>A mix of pride and his conviction that Trump was a threat to democracy kept Biden fighting until it was, perhaps, too late.</p>

<p>Franklin Foer, author of a book on the Biden presidency, wrote recently that "humiliation -- and its transcendence -- is Biden's origin story."</p>

<p>"Right now it is his psychological prison, a mental habit that might doom American democracy," he wrote in the Atlantic.</p>

<p><strong>'Cruel losses'</strong></p>

<p>That outlook was largely formed by a hardscrabble childhood in Scranton, Pennsylvania, in the American rust-belt.</p>

<p>Biden was part of a close-knit Irish Catholic family -- he was just the second Catholic US president after his hero John F. Kennedy -- that was known for its intense pride.</p>

<p>His mother Jean told the young Joey and his siblings every day that "nobody was better than a Biden," Ben Cramer wrote in his book "What It Takes," about the 1988 US election campaign.</p>

<p>He was also known for never backing down.</p>

<p>"He decided to fight... BANGO -- he'd punch the guy in the face," Cramer wrote.</p>

<p>One affliction Biden famously had to battle was a childhood stutter.</p>

<p>Repeatedly humiliated at school, the young Biden ended up teaching himself how to speak smoothly by sheer determination, repeating phrases again and again into the mirror.</p>

<p>But Biden's biggest test was yet to come.</p>

<p>In 1972, he was only 29 and had just won an unlikely victory to be elected senator for Delaware when his wife Neilia and their one-year-old daughter Naomi were killed in a car crash. Their young sons Beau and Hunter were left badly injured.</p>

<p>Tragedy struck again in 2015 when Beau died of brain cancer, aged 46.</p>

<p>Biden also had to deal with the agony of Hunter's drug addiction and legal problems.</p>

<p>"Sometimes I marvel at Joe's strength. His life has been marked by cruel losses," First Lady Jill Biden, whom Biden married in 1977, said in her memoir "Where the Light Enters."</p>

<p><strong>'President for all Americans'</strong></p>

<p>With his family close around him, Biden did not let two failed presidential bids -- and a nearly fatal aneurysm in 1988 -- discourage him.</p>

<p>He served as Barack Obama's vice president for two terms, and his stubborn persistence in pursuit of the top job paid off when he came out of retirement to beat Trump in 2020, defying critics who said he was too old.</p>

<p>Saying at his inauguration he wanted to be a "president for all Americans," his old-fashioned centrism was a relief to many after the divisiveness of the Trump years.</p>

<p>At home he forced through a massive Covid recovery scheme and a green investment plan.</p>

<p>In Kamala Harris, his likely successor to the Democratic nomination, he appointed the first female, Black and South Asian vice president in US history.</p>

<p>US allies welcomed his pledge that "America is back" and his strong support for Ukraine.</p>

<p>But despite the best efforts of the White House to limit his public appearances, his age became the story again.</p>

<p>A series of senior moments culminated in the disastrous debate performance against Trump that doomed his bid for a second term.</p>

<p>As he fought to save it, he returned to the image of the underdog, often repeating his father's saying: "Don't compare me to the Almighty, compare me to the alternative."</p>

<p>Now Democrats have done just that.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For years Kamala Harris faced criticism that she was not up to the job of being a heartbeat away from the presidency. Now, she finds herself feted by Democrats as their best hope to stop Donald Trump's comeback.</p>

<p>Despite blazing a trail as the first woman, Black and South Asian vice president in US history, the 59-year-old Democrat long struggled with approval ratings as bad or worse than President Joe Biden's.</p>

<p>The last 12 months, however, have revealed a transformed Harris.</p>

<p>And with Biden's endorsement of Harris after stunning the world by dropping his own reelection bid Sunday, she's suddenly on the cusp of history.</p>

<p>Harris will hope she has done the hard work to earn her full party's backing in the midst of the crisis.</p>

<p>As the ageing Biden faded over the last year, his "veep" emerged as a force on the campaign trail, pushing for abortion rights and reaching out to core voters, including suburban women and Black men.</p>

<p>With a fondness for the f-bomb and her family nickname of "Momala" going viral, she has also finally started to cut through the noise to voters who previously barely paid attention.</p>

<p>She has also won plaudits in party circles by staying loyal to the 81-year-old president during the last few weeks, even as political vultures circled over his candidacy.</p>

<p>She now is likely to face Trump -- a brutal battle against a candidate who defeated Hillary Clinton in her bid become the first female commander in chief in 2016.</p>

<p>The fact that Harris has blamed much of the criticism of her by Republicans on racism and sexism would likely make a win feel even more vindicating for her.</p>

<p>Trump and other Republicans have notably stepped up their attacks on her as Biden's position weakened and polls showed Harris would fare better against him than Biden.</p>

<h3><strong>'Ready to serve'</strong></h3>

<p>A child of immigrant parents -- her father was from Jamaica and her mother from India -- Harris grew up in Oakland, California, in an activist household that saw her attend her first rallies in a stroller.</p>

<p>Her focus on rights and justice saw her build an impressive CV, becoming California's first Black attorney general and the first woman of South Asian heritage elected to the US Senate.</p>

<p>Harris then went up against Biden in the 2020 primaries. In one stinging attack, she criticized him for allegedly opposing the bussing of students to segregated schools.</p>

<p>"There was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools, and she was bussed to school every day. And that little girl was me," she said in a barbed attack on her future boss.</p>

<p>But as his running mate, she consolidated the coalition that helped defeat the incumbent Trump in 2020.</p>

<p>Her transition to the White House, however, proved difficult.</p>

<p>Critics said she was underwhelming and gaffe-prone in a job that has been known to flummox many officeholders.</p>

<p>Struggling to carve out a role, she was tasked by Biden with getting to the roots of the illegal migration problem, but fumbled and then got defensive in response to a question during a visit to the Mexican border.</p>

<p>Unusually high staff turnover fed rumors of discontent in the vice presidential office.</p>

<p>And Republicans relentlessly targeted her as being unfit to take over should the worst happen to America's oldest-ever president, often resorting to stereotypes her supporters branded as sexist and racist.</p>

<p>Harris told the Wall Street Journal in February: "I am ready to serve. There's no question about that."</p>

<h3><strong>'Momala'</strong></h3>

<p>Things began to change as the 2024 race got underway.</p>

<p>The Biden campaign repeatedly deployed her to battleground states to hammer home the party's message on abortion rights, with Harris becoming the first vice president to visit an abortion clinic.</p>

<p>Gradually, she began to draw warm and fired-up crowds.</p>

<p>Some of the outreach was, however, cringe-inducing. Earlier this year, she was mocked after she told chat show host Drew Barrymore her family sometimes called her "Momala," and Barrymore replied: "We need you to be Momala of the country."</p>

<p>But voters seemed to be switching on.</p>

<p>A clip of her quoting her mother as often saying "You think you just fell out of a coconut tree?" became a meme, with a rising sense among supporters that now could be her time.</p>

<p>If elected, Harris would break one of the highest glass ceilings left for women in the United States -- that of occupying the country's top office.</p>

<p>Her husband, Douglas Emhoff, would also be breaking new ground, moving from being the current Second Gentleman to the country's first First Gentleman.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Joe Biden's withdrawal upends what was already a White House race for the ages, but it will rattle Donald Trump, too -- forcing him to recalibrate a campaign that was focused almost entirely on his former opponent.</p>

<p>For months Trump and his allies have been playing on concerns that the 81-year-old Biden may no longer be fit for office, gleefully sharing video clips of every stammer, rhetorical gaffe and red carpet stumble.</p>

<p>He was frequently a target of Republican mockery and scorn at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, where Trump's newly announced running mate J.D. Vance called him "Fake Scranton Joe."</p>

<p>But with the Democrat no longer in the race, the Trump operation finds itself pushed into a strategic pivot, forced now to shift its messaging to fit a contest with no incumbent and a yet-to-be-confirmed opponent, although Biden did endorse Vice President Kamala Harris on Sunday as he pulled out of the race.</p>

<p>"Biden withdrawing is bad news for Trump," Henry Olsen, a senior fellow at the conservative Ethics and Public Policy Center think tank, told AFP.</p>

<p>"Biden has the lowest job approval of any first-term president at this stage of his presidency in polling history and is also irretrievably burdened by his age. It's much better for Trump to run against him than any conceivable opponent."</p>

<p>Trumpworld had been playing down the chances of Biden withdrawing, but behind the scenes aides have been consumed by the contingencies, preparing a brutal assault on the veteran Democrat's heir apparent, Harris.</p>

<p>"Nothing fundamentally changes" Jason Miller, one of Trump's closest advisors, told AFP during the Republican convention, saying that any "radical liberal" Democratic opponent, Harris or otherwise, shares "the responsibility for the failure of destroying our economy."</p>

<p>Harris, a 59-year-old former California senator is not a shoo-in, and could face competition from multiple leading Democrats in Congress and the nation's 23 Democratic governors.</p>

<p>"I'm going to show up and I'm going to campaign -- whether it's him or somebody else," Trump told a radio network in Virginia before Biden's announcement, pointing to polls showing him doing as well or better against other Democrats.</p>

<p>- Clash of cultures -</p>

<p>Voters have been telling pollsters for months they want younger political leaders, and a ticket topped by a relatively youthful swing state governor, for example, would be a threat to Trump, who would be 82 at the end of a second term.</p>

<p>A campaign led by Harris and backed up by a moderate midwestern running mate could present the biggest danger though, helping turn out more women, who historically vote in greater numbers than men and are a weakness for Trump.</p>

<p>Harris would also give Democrats a chance to redefine the race at their convention in Chicago in August as a clash of cultures between a former prosecutor and a convicted felon.</p>

<p>And Harris ensures that abortion rights -- one of her biggest domestic priorities and another vulnerability for Trump and the Republicans -- remains a crucial election issue.</p>

<p>Trump's new, serious focus on the vice president was demonstrated by his bestowal on her of one of his famous nicknames, referring to her on social media recently as "Laffin' Kamala Harris."</p>

<p>- 'Destruction and chaos' -</p>

<p>It is the disastrous June presidential debate in Atlanta that proved the catalyst for Biden's withdrawal.</p>

<p>A new survey from Democratic polling form Public Policy Polling released Thursday found that Harris -- with the right running mate -- likely can defeat Trump and Vance in Pennsylvania and Michigan, two of the three "Blue Wall" states seen as critical to electing a Democratic president.</p>

<p>The vice president has the disadvantage of incumbency, though, meaning Trump can pin on her anything that was considered a weakness for Biden -- including the border crisis, on which Harris led the administration's early efforts.</p>

<p>Several Democratic rising stars have been floated as alternatives, including governors Josh Shapiro, Gretchen Whitmer and Gavin Newsom.</p>

<p>Newsom, of California -- who has demonstrated a willingness to go toe-to-toe with top Republicans -- would be unlikely to be intimidated by Trump's broadsides.</p>

<p>Whitmer was considered for the Biden ticket in 2020 and has since spearheaded a Democratic resurgence in Michigan, while Pennsylvania's Shapiro is another serious contender as chief executive of a critical swing state.</p>

<p>Whoever becomes the nominee, Trump will likely spend the rest of the campaign pushing them on their past defenses of Biden, accusing them of covering up the president's decline.</p>

<p>"The destruction and chaos created by the Biden administration isn't just on Crooked Joe -- it's on the entire Democrat Party," the Trump team said in a recent edition of its daily circular.</p>

<p>"None have been worse than Kamala Harris, who has lied repeatedly -- presumably putting her own position above the security of the American people."</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, has tweeted his disapproval of US President Biden's move to end his re-election campaign.</p>

<p>"I believe in an America that maximizes individual freedom and merit. That used to be the Democratic Party, but now the pendulum has swung to the Republican Party," read his post on X, formerly Twitter.</p>

<p>US President Joe Biden ended his re-election campaign on Sunday after fellow Democrats lost confidence in him and his ability to beat Donald Trump, especially after his shockingly poor performance in a televised debate last month against the Republican candidate.</p>

<p>His failure to complete sentences was widely noticed and took away focus from the many false statements and other gaffe made by Mr Trump. Days later he raised fresh concerns in an interview, shrugging off Democrats' worries and a widening gap in opinion polls, and saying he would be fine losing to Trump if he knew he'd "gave it my all."</p>

<p>Mr Biden's gaffes at a NATO summit - invoking Russian President Vladimir Putin's name when he meant Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and calling Harris "Vice President Trump" -further stoked anxieties.</p>

<p>In his note announcing his decision, which he posted on social media, President Biden wrote,&nbsp; "It has been the greatest honor of my life to serve as your President. And while it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term".</p>

<p>The move clears the path for Vice President Kamala Harris to run at the top of the ticket -- the first Black woman to do so in the country's history. It is not clear whether she would be challenged by other party leaders.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden announced on Sunday that he was withdrawing from the presidential race against challenger Donald Trump, following a dismal debate performance and flagging polling numbers.</p>

<p>The stepping down of the Democratic party's flag bearer at the last minute is unprecedented in modern US electoral history, and a high-risk move.</p>

<p>Here's a look at how replacing the 81-year-old could work.</p>

<h3><strong>Chaotic convention?</strong></h3>

<p>To designate a formal nominee, delegates from all 50 states attend their party's summer nominating convention to officially anoint a candidate based on primary voting.</p>

<p>Biden overwhelmingly won the primary votes, and the party's roughly 3,900 delegates heading to the convention in Chicago this August are beholden to him.</p>

<p>With Biden exiting, the delegates have to find a replacement. That brings US politics back to the old days, when party bosses jostled to pick a nominee through deal-making in smoke-filled back rooms and endless rounds of voting.</p>

<p>On March 31, 1968, then-president Lyndon Johnson made the shock announcement in the middle of the Vietnam War that he would not seek reelection.</p>

<p>The move turned that year's convention, also in Chicago, into a political crisis with protesters in the streets and left-leaning delegates angry at the pro-war stance of party-picked candidate Hubert Humphrey.</p>

<p>Following that debacle, states more widely embraced the primary process and conventions have become well-oiled affairs whose outcomes are known in advance since they are determined by the primaries.</p>

<h3><strong>Who might fill in?</strong></h3>

<p>Immediately after the debate, Democrats had circled their wagons around Biden, at least when speaking on the record.</p>

<p>All of that dissolved as time went on, with increasingly senior party leaders publicly questioning the viability of the incumbent's candidacy.</p>

<p>A natural -- but not automatic -- pick to take Biden's place would be his running mate on the 2020 ticket, Vice President Kamala Harris. Biden endorsed her Sunday as he announced he is pulling out.</p>

<p>Sent in to put out the fire after the Democratic president's lackluster performance at the debate, the 59-year-old conceded Biden had been "slow to start" against Trump but had "finished strong."</p>

<p>Otherwise, any of a number of strong Democratic politicians -- Governors Gavin Newsom of California, Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan and Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania have been mentioned -- might be called on.</p>

<h3><strong>Third-party chances?</strong></h3>

<p>With Biden dropping out, could a strong third-party hopeful emerge? So far, no independent candidate is posing any danger to the United States's dominant two-party system.</p>

<p>In 1992, Texas billionaire Ross Perot, running as an independent, managed to win nearly 19 percent of the popular vote.</p>

<p>But in the end, because of the way the country's electoral system works, he did not receive a single one of the votes that matter most: those of the 538 members of the Electoral College that ultimately decide the winner.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President Joe Biden as of Saturday night had planned to stay in the 2024 presidential race, but told senior staff on Sunday afternoon that he was withdrawing, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters.</p>

<p>"Last night the message was to proceed with everything, full speed ahead," the source told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity. "At around 1:45 p.m. today: the president told his senior team that he had changed his mind."</p>

<p>The decision caught many White House staff off guard, with several expressing shock that the president had made the announcement while recuperating from a bout of COVID-19 at his home in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware.</p>

<p>Nursing a cough, the 81-year-old Biden had spent the weekend stewing over Democratic pressure to force him to leave the race.</p>

<p>He had been particularly irked at former House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, whom Biden advisers believed was orchestrating a pressure campaign to get him to stand down.</p>

<p>Hours before the shock announcement, the Biden campaign denied reports that he was planning to drop out.</p>

<p>"It is false. And I think that it is false to continue to try to gin up this narrative," deputy campaign manager Quentin Fulks told MSNBC's "The Weekend” on Sunday morning.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said on Sunday he thinks Vice President Kamala Harris will be easier to defeat in November's election than Democratic President Joe Biden, who earlier in the day stepped aside as his party's candidate.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said on Sunday he thinks Vice President Kamala Harris will be easier to defeat in November's election than Democratic President Joe Biden, who earlier in the day stepped aside as his party's candidate.</p>

<p>CNN said the Republican former president made the comments to the network shortly after Biden announced his decision. Trump and his campaign later also attacked Biden and Harris on social media while saying Biden was unfit to continue serving as president.</p>

<p>Biden ended his reelection campaign on Sunday after fellow Democrats lost faith in his mental acuity and ability to beat Trump. Biden endorsed Harris to replace him as the party's candidate.</p>

<p>Biden had faced growing doubts about his reelection chances after a weak and faltering performance in a televised debate against Trump late last month.</p>

<p>On his Truth Social platform on Sunday, Trump said Biden "was not fit to run for President, and is certainly not fit to serve."</p>

<p>Other top Republicans, including House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson, also said Biden was not fit to serve as president and finish his term if he was stepping aside as the Democratic presidential candidate. Johnson explicitly called on Biden to resign.</p>

<p>Trump, in a post on his Truth Social platform, said: "We will suffer greatly because of his (Biden's) presidency, but we will remedy the damage he has done very quickly."</p>

<p>Trump and Biden had been mostly tied in polls, but after the debate some polls showed Trump narrowly ahead of the president in a match-up for the November elections.</p>

<p>The Trump campaign had already begun discussions about how it would redeploy campaign resources for the possibility of Biden's dropping out, a source with direct knowledge of the matter said on Sunday.</p>

<p>Given that any alternative Democratic candidate would likely have different strengths and weaknesses than Biden, that person said, the president's dropping out would require rethinking where to spend ad dollars and where to deploy resources more generally.</p>

<p>Publicly, Trump campaign advisers and allies have been telling reporters they are not worried about facing Harris because they can simply tie her to Biden's record in office, particularly on immigration and inflation. They say they will try to portray Harris, and any of the other candidates being suggested as alternatives for the Democrats, as being to the left of Biden on various policies.</p>

<p>In a statement after Biden dropped out, the Trump campaign said Harris was Biden's "enabler in chief." The campaign said Biden and Harris owned each other's records and "there is no distance between the two."</p>

<p>The official Republican National Committee YouTube channel published a two minute video on Sunday afternoon attacking Harris over immigration policies, alleging she neglected that issue.</p>

<p>In recent weeks, Trump's campaign and some of his allies have launched pre-emptive political attacks on Harris to try to discredit her amid talk she could replace Biden atop the party's 2024 presidential ticket.</p>

<p>In March 2021 Biden said Harris would lead efforts with Mexico and Central American nations to address illegal immigration.</p>

<p>Republicans have seized on that to accuse her of failing to stem the flow of millions of migrants crossing illegally into the United States, although she was never directly responsible for securing the southern border.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden ended his reelection campaign on Sunday after fellow Democrats lost faith in his mental acuity and ability to beat Donald Trump while endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris to replace him as the party's candidate.</p>

<p>Biden, 81, in a post on X, said he will remain in his role as president and commander-in-chief until his term ends in January 2025 and will address the nation this week.</p>

<p>"It has been the greatest honor of my life to serve as your President. And while it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term," Biden wrote.</p>

<p>His initial statement had not included an endorsement of Harris, but he followed up a few minutes later with an expression of support.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">My fellow Democrats, I have decided not to accept the nomination and to focus all my energies on my duties as President for the remainder of my term. My very first decision as the party nominee in 2020 was to pick Kamala Harris as my Vice President. And it's been the best… <a href="https://t.co/x8DnvuImJV">pic.twitter.com/x8DnvuImJV</a></p>
— Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) <a href="https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1815087772216303933?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 21, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p>Harris, 59, would become the first Black woman to do run at the top of a major-party ticket in the country's history.</p>

<p>It was unclear whether other senior Democrats would challenge Harris for the party's nomination - she was widely seen as the pick for many party officials - or whether the party itself would choose to open the field for nominations.</p>

<p>Biden's announcement follows a wave of public and private pressure from Democratic lawmakers and party officials to quit the race after his shockingly poor performance in a June 27 televised debate last month against Republican rival Trump, 78.</p>

<p>Biden's failure at times to complete clear sentences took the public spotlight away from Trump's performance, in which he made a string of false statements, and trained it instead on questions surrounding Biden's fitness for another 4-year term.</p>

<p>Days later he raised fresh concerns in an interview, shrugging off Democrats' worries and a widening gap in opinion polls, and saying he would be fine losing to Trump if he knew he'd "gave it my all."</p>

<p>His gaffes at a NATO summit - invoking Russian President Vladimir Putin's name when he meant Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and calling Harris "Vice President Trump" -further stoked anxieties.</p>

<p>Only four days before Sunday's announcement, Biden was diagnosed with COVID-19 for a third time, forcing him to cut short a campaign trip to Las Vegas. More than one in 10 congressional Democrats had called publicly for him to quit the race.</p>

<p>Biden's historic move - the first sitting president to give up his party's nomination for reelection since President Lyndon Johnson in March 1968 - leaves his replacement with less than four months to wage a campaign.</p>

<p>If Harris emerges as the nominee, the move would represent an unprecedented gamble by the Democratic Party: its first Black and Asian American woman to run for the White House in a country that has elected one Black president and never a woman president in more than two centuries of democracy.</p>

<p>Biden was the oldest U.S. president ever elected when he beat Trump in 2020. During that campaign, Biden described himself as a bridge to the next generation of Democratic leaders. Some interpreted that to mean he would serve one term, a transitional figure who beat Trump and brought his party back to power.</p>

<p>But he set his sights on a second term in the belief that he was the only Democrat who could beat Trump again amid questions about Harris's experience and popularity. In recent times, though, his advanced age began to show through more. His gait became stilted and his childhood stutter occasionally returned.</p>

<p>His team had hoped a strong performance at the June 27 debate would ease concerns over his age. It did the opposite: a Reuters/Ipsos poll after the debate showed that about 40% of Democrats thought he should quit the race.</p>

<p>Donors began to revolt and supporters of Harris began to coalesce around her. Top Democrats, including former House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a longtime ally, told Biden he cannot win the election.</p>

<p>Biden initially resisted pressure to step aside. He held damage-control calls and meetings with lawmakers and state governors, and sat for rare television interviews. But it was not enough. Polls showed Trump's lead in key battleground states widening, and Democrats began to fear a wipeout in the House and Senate. On July 17, California's Rep. Adam Schiff called on him to exit the race.</p>

<p>Biden's departure sets up a stark new contrast, between the Democrats' presumptive new nominee, Harris, a former prosecutor, and Trump who at 78 is two decades her senior and faces two outstanding criminal prosecutions related to his attempts to overturn the 2020 election result. He is due to be sentenced in New York in September on a conviction for trying to cover up a hush-money payment to a porn star.</p>

<p>BIDEN STRUGGLED BEFORE DEBATE</p>

<p>Earlier this year, facing little opposition, Biden easily won the Democratic Party's primary race to pick its presidential candidate, despite voter concerns about his age.</p>

<p>However, his staunch support for Israel's military campaign in Gaza eroded support among some in his own party, particularly young, progressive Democrats and voters of color.</p>

<p>Many Black voters say Biden has not done enough for them, and enthusiasm among Democrats overall for a second Biden term had been low. Even before the debate with Trump, Biden was trailing the Republican in some national polls and in the battleground states he would have needed to win to prevail on Nov. 5.</p>

<p>Harris was tasked with reaching out to those voters in recent months.</p>

<p>During the primary race, Biden accumulated more than 3,600 delegates to the Democratic National Convention to be held in Chicago in August. That was almost double the 1,976 needed to win the party's nomination.</p>

<p>Unless the Democratic Party changes the rules, delegates pledged to Biden would enter the convention "uncommitted," leaving them to vote on his successor.</p>

<p>Democrats also have a system of "superdelegates," unpledged senior party officials and elected leaders whose support is limited on the first ballot but who could play a decisive role in subsequent rounds.</p>

<p>Biden beat Trump in 2020 by winning in the key battleground states, including tight races in Pennsylvania and Georgia. At a national level, he bested Trump by more than 7 million votes, capturing 51.3% of the popular vote to Trump's 46.8%.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

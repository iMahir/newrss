       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Wednesday congratulated US presidential election winner Donald Trump and urged continued close trans-Atlantic ties, telling him in English: "We're better off together".</p>

<p>"Together we can achieve much more than against each other," added the centre-left leader of Europe's biggest economy.</p>

<p>"Both sides benefit from the trans-Atlantic partnership," Scholz said in a statement to media. "The EU and the USA are two similarly large economic areas, linked by the closest economic relations in the world."</p>

<p>In an earlier message posted on X, Scholz said that "Germany and the USA have long been working together successfully to promote prosperity and freedom on both sides of the Atlantic.</p>

<p>"We will continue to do so for the benefit of our citizens."</p>

<p>The messages amounted to a pledge for a fresh start after Trump's last term in the White House, when he berated the NATO ally on what he deemed insufficient defence spending as well as on trade and other issues.</p>

<p>Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock, just back from a visit to war-torn Ukraine, said that "Germany will be a close, reliable ally for the future American government, that is what we are offering".</p>

<p>"As in any good partnership, where there are undoubtedly political differences, an honest and above all intensive exchange is more important than ever."</p>

<p>She said that during her visit to Ukraine as it continues to fight against Russian forces, "I have felt more clearly than ever before how much depends on Europeans and Americans standing up together for freedom, international law and democracy."</p>

<p>Concern has risen in Ukraine and across Europe as Trump has criticised the scale of US defence spending for Kyiv, and many fear his pledge to bring peace "in 24 hours" could amount to a deal on Moscow's terms.</p>

<p>Baerbock said a just peace "will only be possible with the Ukrainians, with the Europeans and with the USA".</p>

<p>"For me, for us, it is clear: We Europeans will now have to take on even more responsibility for security policy."</p>

<p>Norbert Roettgen, a veteran foreign policy expert from the conservative German opposition party CDU, described Trump's victory in less diplomatic terms.</p>

<p>"Trump is unpredictable," he told the Rheinische Post daily. "If there were further support for Ukraine under him, that would be a surprise. He believes that the Europeans should do it themselves, and this position is popular in the USA."</p>

<p>He predicted a "period of stress in trans-Atlantic relations" and said it would be up to Europe "to do our part much more quickly and comprehensively for the trans-Atlantic partnership."</p>

<p>One of the first German politicians to congratulate Trump was Alice Weidel of the far-right Alternative for Germany, who wrote on X early Wednesday: "Congratulations to Donald J. Trump on becoming the 47th President of the United States!"</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump on Wednesday won the US presidential election over Kamala Harris, and world leaders were swift in congratulating the Republican.</p>

<p>Donald Trump vowed strict trade measures against China on the campaign trail for the White House, and the relationship between Washington and Beijing will be one of the key themes of his tenure.</p>

<p>Here is a selection of comments made by Trump about China:</p>

<p>-- "The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make US manufacturing non-competitive," Trump tweeted in November 2012.</p>

<p>-- "I beat the people from China. I win against China. You can win against China if you're smart. But our people don't have a clue. We give state dinners to the heads of China. I said, 'why are you doing state dinners for them? They're ripping us left and right. Just take them to McDonald's and go back to the negotiating table," Trump said at a July 2015 rally.</p>

<p>-- "We can't continue to allow China to rape our country, and that's what we're doing," Trump told a campaign rally in May 2016, insisting that the United States had "a lot of power with China."</p>

<p>-- "China is letting us down in that they have not been buying the agricultural products from our great Farmers that they said they would," Trump tweeted in July 2019.</p>

<p>-- "For the people that are now out of work because of the important and necessary containment policies, for instance the shutting down of hotels, bars and restaurants, money will soon be coming to you. The onslaught of the Chinese Virus is not your fault! Will be stronger than ever!" he wrote in a tweet in March 2020.</p>

<p>-- "China's pattern of misconduct is well known. For decades, they have ripped off the United States like no one has ever done before. Hundreds of billions of dollars a year were lost dealing with China, especially over the years during the prior administration," he said in May 2020.</p>

<p>-- "As we pursue this bright future, we must hold accountable the nation which unleashed this plague onto the world: China," Trump told the United Nations in September 2020, referring to the coronavirus pandemic.</p>

<p>-- "Think of President Xi: central casting, a brilliant guy. You know, when I say he's brilliant, everyone says, 'Oh that's terrible'... Well, he runs 1.4 billion people with an iron fist. Smart, brilliant, everything perfect. There's nobody in Hollywood like this guy," he said in July 2023 at a Fox News town hall.</p>

<p>-- "I had a very strong relationship with him," Trump said of President Xi to the Wall Street Journal in October 2024. "He was actually a really good, I don't want to say friend -- I don't want to act foolish, 'he was my friend' -- but I got along with him great."</p>

<p>Trump added: "He's a very fierce person."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For the second time in eight years, a woman has won the Democratic nomination for US president, only to come up short in a campaign where gender was a central issue.</p>

<p>Like Hillary Clinton in 2016, Kamala Harris had a shot at becoming the first woman to occupy the Oval Office but stumbled at the final hurdle.</p>

<p>While the charisma of their opponent -- Donald Trump, in both cases -- clearly played a role in these historic defeats, many observers also saw misogyny as a factor.</p>

<p>In their dueling campaigns, Harris and Trump laid out starkly different visions for women's status and rights.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/world-leaders-pledge-to-work-with-trump-as-he-claims-us-election-in-6957090">Trump</a>, who has faced multiple accusations of sexual assault he denies, sought to broadcast a hypermasculine image, appearing alongside mixed martial artists and offering praise for autocratic world leaders.</p>

<p>He and his campaign surrogates also made multiple comments that were criticized as insulting or contemptuous of women.</p>

<p>He called<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-election-results-2024-people-from-kamala-harris-indian-ancestral-village-in-tamil-nadu-express-disappointment-6957062"> Harris</a> "crazy" and "mentally disabled", and claimed she would be "like a play toy" for other world leaders if elected.</p>

<p>His running mate, Ohio Senator J.D. Vance, doubled down on a quip he made in 2021 about "childless cat ladies" running the country, saying "I've got nothing against cats."</p>

<p>Trump also presented himself as a "protector" of women, saying he would protect them whether they "like it or not."</p>

<h3><strong>Defender of women's rights</strong></h3>

<p>Harris by contrast relied heavily on female celebrities such as Beyonce, Jennifer Lopez, Lady Gaga and Oprah Winfrey, betting that they would help her reach even conservative women voters.</p>

<p>Harris did not campaign openly on the fact that she would have been the first female president of the United States.</p>

<p>But she made the defense of women's rights, and abortion in particular, one of the cornerstones of her campaign.</p>

<p>But this appears not to have won over enough moderately conservative women.</p>

<p>At a campaign rally last month, former first lady Michelle Obama denounced the apparent double standard by which the two White House candidates were judged.</p>

<p>"We expect her to be intelligent and articulate, to have a clear set of policies, to never show too much anger, to prove time and time again that she belongs," she said of Harris.</p>

<p>"But for Trump, we expect nothing at all. No understanding of policy, no ability to put together a coherent argument, no honesty, no decency, no morals."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At the Palm Beach County Convention Center in Florida, it was midnight when Donald Trump and his entourage appeared on stage to a resounding applause from a crowd eagerly waiting to catch a glimpse of their President-elect. Moments into his victory speech on Tuesday, Trump lauded his running mate JD Vance and his Indian-American wife, Usha Chilukuri Vance.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-election-results-live-now-i-can-say-vice-president-donald-trumps-shoutout-to-jd-vance-his-wife-6955555 ">Trump defeated Democratic rival Kamala Harris</a> by a margin of 53 electoral votes. “I want to be the first to congratulate - now I can say Vice President-elect JD Vance. And his remarkable and beautiful wife, Usha Vance,” Trump said, drawing loud cheers from the audience.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<strong>Who is Usha Vance?</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Born to Indian parents who emigrated from Andhra Pradesh to the US in 1986, <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/meet-india-origin-usha-chilukuri-vance-wife-of-trumps-vice-president-pick-6114615">Usha Chilukuri Vance</a> was raised in a suburb of San Diego, California.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>She earned a bachelor's degree in History from Yale University and went on to complete a Master of Philosophy at the University of Cambridge as a Gates Scholar.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>The would-be Second Lady of the United States also held editorial roles at the Yale Journal of Law &amp; Technology and The Yale Law Journal, where she served as Managing Editor and Executive Development Editor, respectively.</li>
	<li>Usha met JD Vance at Yale Law School and got married in 2014 in a ceremony that included a Hindu ritual. Together, they have three children. Throughout JD Vance's political career, Usha has been a supportive partner, often appearing alongside him during his Ohio Senate campaign. Her insights also contributed to JD Vance's well-known memoir, Hillbilly Elegy, which sheds light on the struggles of rural America and was later adapted into a movie directed by Ron Howard.</li>
	<li>She works as a corporate litigator at a&nbsp;firm in San Francisco. Her legal career also includes clerking for US Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh.</li>

       <description><![CDATA[Donald Trump touted his ability to "get away with it" as a defining theme of his life story when he first ran for president in 2016 -- boasting that he could shoot someone on New York's Fifth Avenue without losing a single vote.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump touted his ability to "get away with it" as a defining theme of his life story when he first ran for president in 2016 -- boasting that he could shoot someone on New York's Fifth Avenue without losing a single vote.</p>

<p>Fast-forward eight years and America's incoming 47th president looks like Nostradamus, winning the keys to the White House on Wednesday despite incredible odds.</p>

<p>He is the most controversial man in the country, narrowly avoided being killed in an assassination attempt, and at 78 will become the oldest person to take the Oval Office in US history.</p>

<p>And that's before throwing in the fact that he's out on bail in three criminal jurisdictions and fighting gigantic civil penalties for sexual assault and fraud. Despite victory, he faces sentencing in just a few weeks on nearly three-dozen felonies related to his 2016 presidential campaign.</p>

<p>Yet in defeating Democrat Kamala Harris, Trump has once more shown he can defy all political and legal gravity.</p>

<p>Many thought this time he wouldn't manage.</p>

<p>He'd closed out November of last year with a 47.4 percent average in opinion polls -- a number that only shifted by one point upward in the intervening year.</p>

<p>Far from moving to the center, he continued to publicly praise foreign dictators, while threatening fellow Americans with military reprisals. He re-upped his once unprecedented, now trademark, claims that Democrats were trying to rig the election against him.</p>

<p>Trump's longest-serving chief-of-staff called him a "fascist."</p>

<p>For most candidates, any of these controversies, let alone the legal issues, would have been career-ending.</p>

<p>Yet for Trump, controversy is all part of the show.</p>

<p>Even an assassination attempt at a Pennsylvania rally that left him bloodied could not keep down the man whose self-branded persona as the ultimate deal-maker has embedded itself in the American psyche.</p>

<p>Now, Trump is about to be reinstalled as the commander in chief of the most powerful military in history, despite a criminal record that would bar him from serving as a private in the army.</p>

<p>And his legal troubles could disappear as the new president -- emboldened by presidential immunity from prosecution -- issues pardons, fires federal prosecutors and gets backing from a Supreme Court dominated by his allies.</p>

<p><strong>'Enemy from within'</strong></p>

<p>Born wealthy and growing up as a playboy real estate entrepreneur, Trump astonished the world by winning the presidency on a hard-right platform in 2016 against Democratic heavyweight Hillary Clinton.</p>

<p>The Republican's first term began with a dark inaugural address evoking "American carnage."</p>

<p>It ended in mayhem when he refused to accept his defeat by Joe Biden, then rallied supporters before they rushed into Congress on January 6, 2021.</p>

<p>In office, Trump upended every tradition, ranging from the trivial (what got planted in the Rose Garden) to the fundamental (relations with NATO).</p>

<p>Journalists became the "enemy of the people" -- a phrase he would later tweak to the "enemy from within" as he called for reprisals against all political opponents.</p>

<p>On the world stage, Trump turned US alliances into transactions as friendly partners like South Korea and Germany were accused of trying to "rip us off."</p>

<p>By contrast, he repeatedly praised -- and continues to praise -- the likes of Russian President Vladimir Putin, China's Xi Jinping and North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un.</p>

<p>Throughout, he increasingly dominated the Republican Party, which dropped all opposition and ended up winning him acquittal in two impeachment proceedings.</p>

<p>That loyalty to Trump only deepened after he left the White House, with senior Republicans regularly trooping to see him at his palatial Florida residence and in the dingy Manhattan courthouse where he was tried for fraud this year.</p>

<p><strong>Autocratic drift</strong></p>

<p>Before he rode down the golden escalator of Trump Tower in New York to announce his 2016 White House bid, Trump was best known as a TV personality.</p>

<p>He was famous mostly for the ruthless character he played on reality show "The Apprentice," as well as for developing luxury buildings and golf resorts, and for his wife Melania, a former fashion model.</p>

<p>The political rise was meteoric. But academics have noted parallels between his evolution and those of autocrats in countries where democratic institutions exist only as facades, allowing populist strongmen to take power.</p>

<p>Millions were thrilled by his attacks on politics, his coarse language, his promises to expel illegal immigrants, and the gaudy glamour that he brought to blue-collar Americans beaten down by globalization and deindustrialization.</p>

<p>At the same time, more than half the country agrees with Trump's top White House aide John Kelly that the tycoon is a fascist, according to a recent ABC poll.</p>

<p>In office, he relished the daily controversy, joking about changing the US Constitution to stay in power indefinitely. As he campaigned to return to power in 2024, he again called for termination of the founding document.</p>

<p>Trump's allies dismiss such talk as mere rhetoric.</p>

<p>But Trump broke all precedent when he refused to concede his 2020 loss, ultimately unleashing a mob on the US Capitol, while his vice president, Mike Pence, went into hiding.</p>

<p>Unprecedented -- but forgiven by just enough US voters to allow the showman to get away with it again.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump's victory speech included a shout-out to Robert F. Kennedy Junior, hinting at a major role for him in the Trump Administration once it is set up, provided he doesn't interfere with America's oil exploration and drilling.</p>

<p>"Bobby, stay away from the liquid gold, Bobby. Other than that, go have a good time," Trump said while acknowledging people who have supported him and been part of his campaign.</p>

<p>Robert F. Kennedy Junior or RFK, fondly called Bobby, as Robert's are commonly referred to, is a politician, lawyer and activist. He has been a strong voice for environmental activism, which is why Donald Trump told him to "stay away from the liquid gold (oil)".</p>

<p>"He wants to do some things and we're going to let him go to it," Donald Trump said, adding that he will help "Make America Healthy Again". Though Trump hasn't specified or declared a portfolio for Mr Kennedy, it is likely that he might be made in-charge of Health. Mr Kennedy too led his campaign with the slogan 'Make America Healthy Again' - a slogan that found mention in Trump's victory speech.</p>

<p>It would still come as a surprise to many if an outspoken 'anti-vaxxer' is made in-charge of Health for all Americans. Mr Kennedy has been promoting vastly hollow and scientifically false ideas about what he claims are the dangers of taking vaccines. He has been propagating fluoride in drinking water.</p>

<p>A member of the Kennedy family, Robert F. Kennedy Jr is a scion of America's storied political clan. He is the son of US's former attorney general and senator Robert F. Kennedy, and a nephew of ex-US President John F. Kennedy as well as former Senator Ted Kennedy.</p>

<p>He was originally standing for election as an Independent candidate and was polling at four to five per cent nationally. In late August, however, he decided to pull out of the race and endorse Donald Trump. He then campaigned with Trump across the battleground states to garner support for him.</p>

<p>Kennedy Jr is a controversial politician as he has been an anti-vaccine activist, as well as a conspiracy theorist. His anti-vaccine advocacy group Children's Health Defense has been a leading proponent of the COVID-19 vaccine misinformation.</p>

<p>Donald Trump also hinted at a role in his administration to billionaire Elon Musk.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Although Kamala Harris has been defeated by Donald Trump in the US presidential election, she will make a comeback as she is a fighter, said residents of Thulasendrapuram, the village of her maternal ancestors, on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Since morning, locals were glued to television screens, monitoring election results, and many checked trends on media websites. Several residents also visited the Sri Dharma Sastha Perumal temple to pray for Harris's victory.</p>

<p>However, as the day progressed, it became pretty clear that it was Donald Trump who was leading and when he eventually defeated his Democratic rival Kamala Harris, Thulasendrapuram village, which teemed with local and outside people, gradually became deserted and returned to its usual state of quietude. Two Americans and a citizen of the UK, fans of Harris, who had landed in the village the day before left the place.</p>

<p>J Sudhakar, DMK Tiruvarur district representative and Thulasendrapuram village leader, told PTI, "We were hoping for her victory and had planned celebrations bigger than Deepavali. We made arrangements to burst firecrackers, distribute sweets, offer temple pujas, and host a community lunch." "But success and failure are part of life. It was a tough fight, and you must admire her fighting spirit. She is a fighter and will make a comeback," he added.</p>

<p>Other villagers shared similar sentiments, expressing confidence that Harris would continue her journey as a fighter and someday become the US president, even if it didn't happen this time.</p>

<p>Village resident and retired ONGC employee T S Anbasarasu said, "We cannot digest the fact that she has lost, but the saving grace is she is only 60 year old and we expect her to win the next election. But Trump is 78. We are confident she will not get bogged down by this loss and will continue her work." Furthermore, Anbarasu said, "Definitely we hope she will visit our village after getting elected in future...we expected her to visit our village a few years back and had sent messages to her relatives too...our village has become a tourist spot because of her." Sudhakar noted that everyone in the village had hoped Harris, whose maternal ancestors hailed from Thulasendrapuram, would become the first woman US president.</p>

<p>"We hope she will win next time and visit our village. When that day comes, we will give her a grand reception. Meanwhile, we extend our best wishes to Donald Trump and hope he fosters good relations with India and promotes global peace," he added.</p>

<p>Trump was elected the 47th president of the United States.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump went from being a businessman, real estate tycoon and reality TV star to becoming the country's first former US President to be declared a convicted felon.</p>

<p>And after surviving two assassination bids during his 2024 campaign, the 78-year-old remains unstoppable with American voters giving him a second term. In the process, he shattered the dream of the Democratic Party, as well as that of millions of Kamala Harris supporters, to finally have the first woman President in the White House.</p>

<p>He is now the oldest person in US history to be elected president.</p>

<p>From the time he left office after his loss in the 2020 presidential election to his nomination as the Republican candidate in the 2024 race, Trump continued to dominate the American news cycle and the country's psyche.</p>

<p>He refused to accept the November 2020 result that brought Joe Biden to the White House, and a stunned nation watched his supporters storm the US Capitol on January 6. The riots disrupted a joint session of the US Congress which was in the process of affirming the presidential election results.</p>

<p>His third run for the job in 2024 was characterised by a slew of indictments and criminal cases, and a conviction in a New York court -- making him the first former US president to be held guilty of a crime.</p>

<p>A grand jury found him guilty on 34 counts of falsifying business records. The Biden-Harris campaign said at the time that no one is above the law while Trump called the verdict the result of a "rigged" political system.</p>

<p>Yet, none of this could deter his ardent supporters, who rallied behind him and his policies.</p>

<p>The vehement support was on full display in Milwaukee in July when Trump, with a bandaged ear after having survived an assassination attempt, arrived for the Republican National Convention to formally accept the party's nomination for President for the third consecutive election.</p>

<p>Trump was hit by a bullet in the upper part of his right ear when a shooter fired multiple shots at his election rally in Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>He was born in Queens, New York, on June 14, 1946, to Mary and Fred Trump, a successful real estate developer, as the fourth of their five children. He earned a degree in finance from the Wharton School of Finance and Commerce at the University of Pennsylvania in 1968.</p>

<p>After taking over his father's company in 1971, he renamed it the Trump Organisation and soon diversified into projects like hotels, resorts, residential and commercial buildings, casinos and golf courses. Trump also dabbled in Reality TV with 'The Apprentice' in 2004 that made him a household name in America.</p>

<p>Trump married Ivana Zelnickova, a Czech athlete and model, but divorced her in 1990. The couple has three children -- Donald Jr, Ivanka and Eric.</p>

<p>He then married actor Marla Maples in 1993 but divorced in 1999. They have an only child, Tiffany. Trump's current wife Melania, whom he married in 2005, is a former Slovenian model. They have a son, Barron William Trump.</p>

<p>In the 2016 presidential race, fighting as a Republican nominee in the presidential race, Trump won against the Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.</p>

<p>The 2024 election took place against the backdrop of concerns over the economy, illegal immigration and the wars in west Asia and Europe. Trump's support base saw him as the only one who could offer solutions to these.</p>

<p>"I will end the illegal immigration crisis by closing our border and finishing the wall, most of which I've already built," Trump told cheering supporters at his party's national convention, referring to the country's southern border.</p>

<p>He vowed that if he returned to the White House, "inflation will vanish completely".</p>

<p>Trump pledged to end the Russia-Ukraine war after Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy reached out to congratulate him on his Republican presidential nomination.</p>

<p>"I, as your next President of the United States, will bring peace to the world and end the war that has cost so many lives and devastated countless innocent families. Both sides will be able to come together and negotiate a deal that ends the violence and paves a path forward to prosperity," Trump had said.</p>

<p>The four years of his second presidency will define not just how the US deals with its pressing domestic issues, it could also dictate its place in the world. The world is watching.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With Donald Trump all set to become US president, Indian exporters may face high customs duties for goods like automobiles, textiles and pharmaceuticals if the new US administration decides to pursue the ‘America First' agenda, opined trade experts.</p>

<p>Experts also said that Trump could also tighten H-1B visa rules, impacting costs and growth for Indian IT firms.</p>

<p>Over 80 per cent of India's IT export earnings come from the US, making it vulnerable to changes in visa policies.</p>

<p>The US is India's largest trading partner, accounting for over USD 190 billion of annual trade.</p>

<p>Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI) Founder Ajay Srivastava said that Trump may extend tariffs beyond China to include India and other countries.</p>

<p>Trump had earlier called India a "large tariff abuser" and in October 2020 labelled India as the 'tariff king'.</p>

<p>These remarks suggest that Trump's second term could bring tougher trade negotiations. he said.</p>

<p>"His America First agenda would likely push for protective measures, such as reciprocal tariffs on Indian goods, potentially adding barriers for key Indian exports like automobiles, wines, textiles, and pharmaceuticals. These increases could make Indian products less competitive in the US, impacting revenue in these sectors," Srivastava said.</p>

<p>However, a tougher US stance on China could create new opportunities for Indian exporters, he added.</p>

<p>The bilateral trade in goods between the two countries stood at USD 120 billion in 2023-24 as against USD 129.4 billion in 2022-23.</p>

<p>A GTRI report had earlier stated that according to WTO's World Tariff Profiles 2023, the US also imposes high duties on items like dairy products (188 per cent), Fruits and vegetables (132 per cent), cereals and food preparations (193 per cent), oilseeds, fats and oils (164 per cent), beverages and tobacco (150 per cent).</p>

<p>International trade expert Biswajit Dhar said that Trump would increase tariffs in various sectors as he has to follow his call for MAGA (Make America Great Again).</p>

<p>"With Trump coming to power, we are going to enter a different era of protectionism," Dhar said adding sectors like electronics may get a hit.</p>

<p>He added that as earlier Trump has walked out of Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), there could be dark clouds on IPEF (Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity).</p>

<p>The 14-nation bloc was launched in Tokyo by the US and other Indo-Pacific countries on May 23, 2022.</p>

<p>"Let us see what he does with IPEF," Dhar cautioned and added that nothing is expected to move in the World Trade Organisation (WTO).</p>

<p>Federation of Indian Export Organisations (FIEO) DG Ajay Sahai said that "we could expect Mr Trump to push for more balanced trade. But trade disputes might arise around tariffs".</p>

<p>Going by the increasing trend of protectionism, Sahai said, the same would continue with tighter immigration rules.</p>

<p>Agneshwar Sen, Partner-Tax and Economic Policy (International Trade), EY India said it may be expected that the US will use high tariffs strategically to onshore manufacturing and change current supply chains.</p>

<p>India could face higher tariffs on exports like textiles, chemicals, pharma and auto/ engineering products, Sen said.</p>

<p>"India would have to either seek alternative markets (which will be difficult) or retaliate with its own tariffs on US exports. Alternately, we must be ready for a trade deal that is attractive to the US while not just protecting our current interests but creating newer ones," he added.</p>

<p>Further Srivastava said that Trump has expressed concerns about outsourcing, and while some statements may be campaign rhetoric, India should prepare for possible measures affecting IT exports.</p>

<p>H-1B visa policies are crucial for the movement of skilled professionals, especially from India's IT sector.</p>

<p>"Trump's stricter immigration stance could lead to changes in visa rules, impacting Indian IT professionals and raising costs for Indian IT companies," the GTRI Founder said.</p>

<p>However, he added that Trump is expected to ease labour and environmental standards, which could make it easier for Indian exports to enter the US market.</p>

<p>"Trump would likely push India to align closely with US geopolitical aims, potentially expanding India's role as an alternative supplier in sectors like electronics and pharmaceuticals but potentially limiting India's foreign policy flexibility," he said.</p>

<p>Likewise, India's increasing demand for advanced technology, energy, and capital goods from the US opens avenues for expanding bilateral trade.</p>

<p>Between FY'2020 and FY'2024, India's merchandise exports to America rose by 46 per cent from USD 53.1 billion to USD 77.5 billion.</p>

<p>Imports from the US also grew to USD 42.2 billion last fiscal from USD 35.8 billion in 2019-20.</p>

<p>On the other hand, trade in services between the two nations expanded from USD 54.1 billion in 2018 to an estimated USD 70.5 billion in 2024, a 30.3 rise.</p>

<p>India is also a key destination for American businesses such as professional, scientific, and technical services, manufacturing, and IT. Washington is the third largest investor. India received USD 66.7 billion between April 2000 and June 2024.</p>

<p>India buys military equipment and Boeings worth billions of dollars from the US and conducts its over 90 per cent global trade in US Dollars.</p>

<p>"The US firms like Google, Facebook gather Terabytes of data every day and earn billions of advertising dollars every year from India. Amazon which had to withdraw from China, is the biggest online retailer in India. The US earns dollars from India from various engagements and not just trade," Srivastava said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday congratulated Donald Trump, who claimed victory in the US presidential election, calling it "history's greatest comeback" and a new beginning in the US-Israel alliance.</p>

<p>The United States is Israel's top ally and military backer, and the election came at a critical time for the Middle East amid wars in Gaza and Lebanon.</p>

<p>"Congratulations on history's greatest comeback! Your historic return to the White House offers a new beginning for America and a powerful recommitment to the great alliance between Israel and America. This is a huge victory!" Netanyahu said in a statement issued by his office.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Dear Donald and Melania Trump,<br />
<br />
Congratulations on history's greatest comeback!<br />
<br />
Your historic return to the White House offers a new beginning for America and a powerful recommitment to the great alliance between Israel and America.<br />
<br />
This is a huge victory!<br />
<br />
In true friendship,… <a href="https://t.co/B54NSo2BMA">pic.twitter.com/B54NSo2BMA</a></p>
— Benjamin Netanyahu - בנימין נתניהו (@netanyahu) <a href="https://twitter.com/netanyahu/status/1854070348926328965?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 6, 2024</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Other Israeli officials also congratulated Trump, including Israel Katz who was named defence minister on Tuesday.</p>

<p>"Congratulations to President-elect @realDonald Trump on his historic victory. Together, we'll strengthen the US-Israel alliance, bring back the hostages, and stand firm to defeat the axis of evil led by Iran," Katz said on X.</p>

<p>President Isaac Herzog also applauded Trump and said he looked forward to strengthen US-Israel ties.</p>

<p>"Congratulations to President @realDonaldTrump on your historic return to the White House... I look forward to working with you to strengthen the ironclad bond between our peoples, to build a future of peace and security for the Middle East, and to uphold our shared values," Herzog said in a statement.</p>

<p>The statements came a day after Netanyahu sacked defence minister Yoav Gallant, following public differences over the war with Hamas in Gaza.</p>

<p>The removal of Gallant -- a hawk on the war with Hezbollah in Lebanon who also pushed for a ceasefire and hostage release deal in Gaza -- was announced on the same day as the presidential election in the United States, Israel's top military backer.</p>

<p>Netanyahu and Gallant have frequently clashed over Israel's retaliatory military offensive against Hamas following the Palestinian group's deadly attack on Israel on October 7 last year.</p>

<p>Shortly after Gallant's removal, thousands of people took to the streets of commercial hub Tel Aviv, chanting slogans against Netanyahu and demanding the return of 97 hostages held in Gaza.</p>

<p>Gideon Saar, who has been appointed as the new foreign minister to replace Katz, also welcomed Trump.</p>

<p>"We welcome your strong and dedicated leadership as we work to build a better future of security and cooperation for the Middle East," Saar said on X.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the projections for the US Presidential elections indicate a win for Republican candidate Donald Trump, the people of Kamala Harris' ancestral Thulasendrapuram village in Tamil Nadu expressed their disappointment since they had planned to celebrate the Democrat's victory by bursting crackers and organising a special victory prayer at the local temple.</p>

<p>Trump is set to become the 47th US President. Harris' supporter, Joy, who came to stay in the Thulasendrapuram village from Chicago earlier expressed confidence about the Democrat candidate winning the US elections.</p>

<p>"If Donald Trump wins, I hope he is given the wisdom to lead us with unity. My hope is that he changes his ways and becomes the one who unites and not a divider. My expectations are different though. I think our country will be in chaos for the next four years," Joy said.</p>

<p>"Just now I watched the result of the US elections. It is a little disappointing for us. Anyway, I hope that Donald Trump will change (his ways) and will not govern like he did earlier. Last time when Kamala won as the Vice Presidential candidate, we celebrated. This time we had planned to celebrate more. But we have to accept the mandate," a resident of the village said.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Trump early on Wednesday morning hailed his countrymen as results of the high stakes presidential elections projected his victory which set poised to return him to the White House after securing an electoral college victory.</p>

<p>Speaking at an address to supporters in West Palm Beach, Florida, Trump affirmed that his win will help the country "heal."</p>

<p>Addressing the crowd accompanied by his running mate, JD Vance, and family members Trump called his projected win the "greatest political movement of all time" which will help in making "America great again."</p>

<p>"This is a movement like nobody has seen before. This was the greatest political movement of all time. There's nothing like this ever in this country...we are gonna help our country heal. We have a country that needs help and needs help very badly. We are gonna fix our borders, we are gonna fix everything about our country," Trump said.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Democratic Campaign co-chair Cedric Richmond said that the Vice President will not address supporters tonight, but is expected to speak tomorrow.</p>

<p>While addressing a gathering, Richmond said that the votes are yet to be counted and there were states that have not been called. "We still have votes to count. We still have states that have not been called yet," Cedric Richmond said.</p>

<p>Earlier in the day, special prayers were offered for the success of US Vice Presidential candidate JD Vance in Andhra Pradesh's Godavari district. The Vice Presidential candidate is the husband of Usha Vance who originally belonged to Vadluru village in the Nidadavolu assembly constituency.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Officials clarified that this test, planned years in advance, highlights nuclear readiness and US commitment to defense amid global security shifts.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Shortly before former President Donald Trump made a statement regarding his lead in the US presidential election, the US defence forces reportedly conducted a test launch of a Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), a move that underscored ongoing strategic defence readiness.</p>

<p>Launched from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California, the unarmed missile travelled more than 4,000 miles across the Pacific Ocean in the direction of the Kwajalein Atoll in the North Pacific. With a top speed of 15,000 miles per hour, the Minuteman III shows that the US military can hit targets anywhere in the world in 30 minutes.</p>

<p>However, the defence officials have clarified that the test was planned years in advance as part of regular drills, aimed at showcasing the "readiness of nuclear US forces." The launch underscores the US commitment to maintaining a state of readiness for its strategic arsenal amidst evolving global security landscapes.</p>

<p>"This test launch marks the start of a remarkable week for our Guardians and Airmen at Vandenberg, with two test launches scheduled from the Western Range," Colonel Bryan Titus, Space Launch Delta 30 vice commander, told<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://metro.co.uk/2024/11/06/us-military-decides-test-hypersonic-nuke-just-hours-ballots-close-21937103/"><em> The Metro.</em></a></p>

<p>"These tests hold immense significance, not only for our nation's defence but also serve as a pivotal moment in showcasing the exceptional capabilities and expertise of our dedicated team."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Donald Trump, who is on the brink of a landslide win in the US election, Republican Presidential candidate Donald Trump thanked his supporters today and described it as a "magnificent victory for the American people". He also referred to the July 13 assassination attempt and said "God spared my life for a reason".</p>

<p>The 78-year-old is currently projected to win 267 electoral college votes, three short of the magic figure of 270. The opponent, incumbent Vice President Kamala Harris is trailing at 224.</p>

<p>Describing the Republican campaign as the "greatest political movement of all time", Trump said, "We are going to help our country heal, fix our borders, we made history for a reason tonight. We have achieved the most incredible political win. I want to thank the American people. I will fight for you and your family with every breath in my body."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>China said Wednesday it hoped for "peaceful coexistence" with the United States as Donald Trump neared a decisive victory over Kamala Harris in the country's presidential election.</p>

<p>"We will continue to approach and handle China-US relations based on the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence, and win-win cooperation," foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning told Global Times, Chinese state tabloid.</p>

<p>"Our policy toward the United States has been consistent," she told the tabloid, which is owned by the ruling Communist party's flagship newspaper the People's Daily.</p>

<p>Donald <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/magnificent-victory-for-american-people-donald-trump-on-us-election-result-6955510">Trump claimed a "magnificent" victory </a>over Kamala Harris in the fight for the presidency on Wednesday as results put him on the verge of one of the most stunning comebacks in US political history.</p>

<p>"This is a magnificent victory for the American people that will allow us to make America great again," the 78-year-old told cheering supporters at his campaign headquarters in Florida.</p>

<p>Beijing as a matter of principle does not comment on other countries' elections, though it said it opposes China being used as an issue on the campaign trail.</p>

<p>In response to another question related to the election result and potential additional US tariffs on Chinese goods, Mao said the US presidential election is an internal affair of the US. "We respect the choice of the American people. As for the tariffs, we do not answer hypothetical question," she said. &nbsp;</p>

<p>During his time as president, Trump launched a gruelling trade war with China, imposing swingeing tariffs on Chinese goods for what he said were unfair practices by Beijing, such as theft of US technology and currency manipulation.</p>

<p>Tensions did not abate under his Democratic successor, Joe Biden, with relations at their lowest levels in decades and Washington introducing sharp tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, EV batteries and solar cells.</p>

<p>World leaders rushed to congratulate Trump before the final results were in, with Ukraine's president in particular urging Trump to help achieve a "just peace" against Russia.</p>

<p>US networks called the swing states of Pennsylvania, Georgia and North Carolina for Trump, and he led the Democratic vice president Kamala Harris in the others although they have not been called yet.</p>

<p>Gloom swiftly descended on Harris's camp as she canceled a watch party for supporters who dreamed of seeing her elected as America's first woman president.</p>

<p>In a further blow to Democrats, Trump's Republican Party also seized control of the Senate, flipping two seats to overturn a narrow Democratic majority.</p>

<p>Trump even appeared to be nearing victory in the popular vote -- something he never achieved in his 2016 victory or in 2020.</p>

<p>For the Democrats, the soul-searching will begin.</p>

<p>Trump's promises of economic bounty and his dark rhetoric on migrants also appear to have resonated with voters who were tired of Biden and Harris's administration.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Kremlin said Wednesday it would judge Donald Trump, who claimed victory in the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/magnificent-victory-for-american-people-donald-trump-on-us-election-result-6955510">US presidential election</a>, on his actions and that President Vladimir Putin had no plans to congratulate him.</p>

<p>Relations between Russia and the US have been at an all-time low since the end of the Cold War, with Moscow angered by Western support to Ukraine.</p>

<p>"We will draw conclusions based on concrete steps and concrete words," Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told journalists.</p>

<p>If elected, Trump has claimed that he would end the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-election-results-2024-what-donald-trump-said-about-wars-in-trump-2-0-victory-speech-6956202#pfrom=home-uselections_uselexhome">fighting in Ukraine</a> within 24 hours.</p>

<p>The US is "capable of helping bring about the end of this conflict" in Ukraine, but is also "the country that is inflaming the conflict", Peskov said.</p>

<p>Peskov said that Trump had made some "quite harsh statements" during his campaign, but that he also spoke of "his aspirations for peace on the international arena, about his aspirations to end politics based on continuing old wars."</p>

<p>He added that: "But after victory, preparing to enter the Oval Office, sometimes statements take on a different tone."</p>

<p>The Kremlin also said it would be "practically impossible" for the next administration to make Russia-US relations worse since they are "at their lowest point in history".</p>

<p>He rejected accusations that Russia had interfered in the US elections.</p>

<p>Peskov said he was "not aware" of Putin's plans to congratulate Trump, since the US is an "unfriendly country that is directly and indirectly involved in a war against our state", referring to the conflict in Ukraine.</p>

<p>Putin was one of the last leaders to congratulate Joe Biden on his 2020 election victory, sending his congratulatory message six weeks after the vote.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With Republican nominee Donald Trump just three votes short of a victory in the Presidential election, wishes from world leaders began pouring in even as he promised a "golden age for America".</p>

<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed confidence that with Mr Trump at the helm, India-US ties will reach greater heights.&nbsp;"As you build on the successes of your previous term, I look forward to renewing our collaboration to further strengthen the India-US Comprehensive Global and Strategic Partnership. Together, let's work for the betterment of our people and to promote global peace, stability and prosperity," he wrote on X.</p>

<p>China's&nbsp;foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning expressed hope for&nbsp;"peaceful coexistence" with the United States, while Kremlin&nbsp;spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the US is an&nbsp;"unfriendly country" and Russia would judge Mr Trump on his actions.</p>

<p>Benjamin Netanyahu, Prime Minister of Israel, said Mr Trump's "historic return to the White House offers a new beginning for America and a powerful recommitment to the great alliance between Israel and America".</p>

<p>Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy recalled a meeting with the president-elect in September, where they both discussed the Ukraine-US strategic partnership to end Russian aggression.&nbsp;"I appreciate President Trump's commitment to the "peace through strength" approach in global affairs. This is exactly the principle that can practically bring just peace in Ukraine closer. I am hopeful that we will put it into action together. We look forward to an era of a strong United States of America under President Trump's decisive leadership. We rely on continued strong bipartisan support for Ukraine in the United States," the Ukraine President wrote in a post on X.</p>

<p>British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, among the first world leaders to issue a congratulatory message, said&nbsp;the "special relationship" between the UK and the US would continue to prosper under the new American administration. "As the closest of allies, we stand shoulder to shoulder in defence of our shared values of freedom, democracy and enterprise. From growth and security to innovation and tech, I know that the UK-US special relationship will continue to prosper on both sides of the Atlantic for years to come," he said.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz&nbsp;vowed that Berlin would work with him for "prosperity and freedom". On the potential working relationship with the US, French President Emmanuel Macron said,&nbsp;"With your convictions and mine. With respect and ambition. For more peace and prosperity."</p>

<p>Anthony Albanese, Prime Minister of Australia, reaffirmed the friendship between the two countries as he congratulated Mr Trump.&nbsp;"Congratulations to President Donald Trump on his election victory. Australians and Americans are great friends and true allies. Working together, we can ensure the partnership between our nations and peoples remains strong into the future," he said in a post on X.</p>

<p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that European Union (EU) and the US are more than just allies. "We are bound by a true partnership between our people, uniting 800 million citizens.So let's work together on a strong transatlantic agenda that keeps delivering for them," she wrote on X.</p>

<p>NATO chief Mark Rutte said Mr Trump's return to power will help keep the alliance "strong".&nbsp;"His leadership will again be key to keeping our Alliance strong. I look forward to working with him again to advance peace through strength through NATO," Rutte said in a statement.</p>

<p>As per Associated Press, 267 electoral votes have gone to Republican candidate Trump and 224 to Democratic Party's Kamala Harris. Trump is just three votes short of a victory.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump claimed victory in the US presidential election 2024 today as according to results he is on the verge of defeating Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris. In his victory speech, he thanked tech tycoon Elon Musk, who has backed him throughout his campaign.</p>

<p>However, even before the results started trickling in, a claim was doing the rounds online that social media platform X, owned by Musk, had changed its 'like button' for the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/magnificent-victory-for-american-people-donald-trump-on-us-election-result-6955510#pfrom=home-uselections_uselexhome">US presidential election</a>. The claim, which has not got any confirmation or denial from the company, was that the like button changed to a ballot box animation whenever it was clicked. Several users posted videos on X that showed the like button spinning into an animated ballot box featuring the US flag on it.</p>

<p>It was also alleged that the like button meant a vote for <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/in-donald-trumps-victory-speech-borders-taxes-wars-take-centrestage-6955924">Trump</a> while the retweet function signified support for Harris.</p>

<p>When ndtv.com checked the feature, it was found that the like button had not changed.</p>

<p>Many users also reported not noticing any changes on the like button.</p>

<p>The claim drew condemnation from a section of social media users, mostly from the Democratic supporters, claiming Musk was trying to influence the US voters.</p>

<p>Republican candidate Trump, addressing a crowd of supporters at the West Palm Beach convention centre in Florida, claimed a "magnificent" victory over Harris. "This is a magnificent victory for the American people that will allow us to make America great again," the 78-year-old told cheering supporters.</p>

<p>During the speech, he praised <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-election-results-live-elon-musk-says-game-set-and-match-as-donald-trump-takes-big-lead-6954331">Elon Musk</a>, saying America has a "new star" in him. "We have a new star... a star is born - Elon!" twice-impeached Trump said.</p>

<p>Elon Musk, also the owner of Tesla and SpaceX, congratulated Trump as he edged closer to victory after winning some key swing states. "The people of America gave @realDonaldTrump a crystal-clear mandate for change tonight," posted the tech billionaire amid a record usage of his platform.</p>

<p>"Sure it was a lot of pressure, but it pales by comparison with President @realDonaldTrump, who they tried to kill twice, bankrupt and imprison for eternity," the X owner further said.</p>

<p>Million of Americans had lined up throughout Election Day and millions more voted early in a race with momentous consequences for the United States and the world.</p>

<p>Polls for weeks had shown a knife-edge race between Harris and Trump, who would be the oldest-ever president at the time of inauguration, the first felon president and only the second in history to serve non-consecutive terms.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Congress leader Shashi Thaoor, who heads the Parliamentary Standing Committee on External Affairs, told NDTV today Donald Trump is a familiar politician who India has engaged with before, and so the Trump 2.0 administration should not have any surprises for India.</p>

<p>In a short conversation with NDTV, the diplomat-turned-politician from Kerala explained briefly the areas that India already understands about Mr Trump's style of working, and how India can keep those in mind while engaging with him again.</p>

<p>"We know him very well. He has already been president for four years. I don't think there will be any surprise as to what kind of politics he will do. He's a transactional politician, 'what can you do for me, and what can I do for you' type of leader," Mr Tharoor, the Congress MP from Thiruvananthapuram, told NDTV.</p>

<p>"He's very tough on trade. If we apply tariffs on American goods coming to India, he'd say the US would also apply high tariffs on Indian goods. This is not good for our companies that are exporting to America," Mr Tharoor said.</p>

<p>"There could be difficulties in immigration issues. He has a very strong stand on immigration. If some of our people who have gone to the US want to take their families, and there's a shortage of visas, they may face problems," he said.</p>

<p>Mr Tharoor called for a balanced approach to China, considering the tough stand the US takes on the Asian giant's rise.</p>

<p>"In security matters, he doesn't like China at all. The US taking a tough stand on China is in our interest. But everything needs a balance. We have known Trump for some years. As I said, there are no surprises. We can engage with him, keeping these things in mind," Mr Tharoor said.</p>

<p>Mr Trump claimed a "magnificent" victory today over Kamala Harris in the fight for the presidency as results put him on the verge of one of the most stunning comebacks in US political history.</p>

<p>The Republican former president's address to a crowd of jubilant supporters came despite the fact that only Fox News had so far declared him the winner of the presidential election.</p>

<p>World leaders rushed to congratulate him before the final results were in, with Ukraine's president in particular urging Mr Trump to help achieve a "just peace" against Russia.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The 59-year-old is the daughter of Donald Trump's brother Fred Trump Jr., who died early. A psychologist, she has written a book an unauthorised biography of Donald Trump, titled: "Too Much and Never Enough: How My Family Created the World's Most Dangerous Man".</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">I am so deeply sorry. I thought better of us.</p>
— Mary L Trump (@MaryLTrump) <a href="https://twitter.com/MaryLTrump/status/1854059265415410166?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 6, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p>A known Trump critic, she had backed Hillary Clinton during the 2016 election which Trump won. After the 2021 Capitol Hill riot, she said her uncle should be "barred from ever running for public office again".</p>

<p>Donald Trump is on the brink of a historic victory in an election that was expected to be a close fight, but ended up being an easy feat for the Republicans.</p>

<p>Addressing his supporters, he described it as a "magnificent victory for the American people". He also referred to the July 13 assassination attempt and said "God spared my life for a reason". He is currently winning 267 electoral college votes, three short of the magic figure of 270. The opponent, incumbent Vice President Kamala Harris is trailing at 224.</p>

<p>Describing the Republican campaign as the "greatest political movement of all time", Trump said, "We are going to help our country heal, fix our borders, we made history for a reason tonight. We have achieved the most incredible political win. I want to thank the American people. I will fight for you and your family with every breath in my body."</p>

<p>A massive factor in Trump's victory was the Republican sweep in seven swing or battleground states. From a 6-1 score in favour of Democrats in the 2020 polls, these seven states swung to a 7-0 advantage for Trump. The Republican leader has already won three swing states -- Georgia, Pennsylvania and North Carolina -- and is leading in Arizona, Wisconsin, Michigan and Nevada.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NASA's Parker Solar Probe is all set to complete its final Venus gravity assist manoeuvre on Wednesday. It will pass within 233 miles (376 km) of the planet's surface. The US space agency said the flyby will adjust the spacecraft's trajectory into its final orbital configuration, bringing it to within 3.86 million miles of the solar surface by December 24, 2024. It will be the closest a human-made object has ever been to the Sun.</p>

<p>The Parker Solar Probe was launched in 2018 on the mission to "touch" the Sun. It is just about the size of a small car.</p>

<p><a href="https://science.nasa.gov/science-research/heliophysics/final-venus-flyby-for-nasas-parker-solar-probe-queues-closest-sun-pass/" rel="nofollow,noindex">NASA said</a> Parker Solar Probe's flybys around the planet have been a major success for new Venus science, especially with the chance discovery from its Wide-Field Imager for Parker Solar Probe, or WISPR.</p>

<p>At the time of its third Venus flyby on July 11, 2020, the scientists turned the instrument towards Venus hoping to track the changes in the planet's thick cloud cover.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“The WISPR cameras can see through the clouds to the surface of Venus, which glows in the near-infrared because it's so hot,” Noam Izenberg, a space scientist at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland said.</p>

<p><strong>What next?</strong></p>

<p>The images from WISPR in 2020 and 2021 flyby revealed Venus' surface in a new light. With the November 6 flyby, the scientists are planning to seek answers to the puzzling questions of previous flybys.</p>

<p>Izenberg said the upcoming event will help scientists "evaluate whether WISPR can help us distinguish physical or even chemical properties of Venus' surface".</p>

<p>Post the Venus flyby on November 6, the spacecraft will be on course coming within 3.8 million miles of the solar surface, the primary objective of the mission first conceived more than 65 years ago.&nbsp;</p>

<p>During this time, the spacecraft is expected to cut through plumes of plasma still connected to the Sun.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On December 24, 2024, the closest approach to the Sun will take place. During this time, the mission control will be out of contact with the spacecraft.&nbsp;After this, the spacecraft will send a beacon tone on December 27, 2024, to check on its health and confirm whether or not it was successful. It will continue to remain in this orbit for the remaining time in the mission and complete two more perihelia at the same distance.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>During her final years of high school, Chinese teenager Xu Yunting found an unusual way to make some pocket money -- transforming herself into male video game characters and taking their female devotees on dates.</p>

<p>The trend, called "cos commissioning", has gained traction in China recently, with social media posts garnering millions of views as an increasing number of young women use their purchasing power to engineer a meeting with their dream man in real life.</p>

<p>One early morning in Shanghai last month, Xu carefully inserted contacts to enlarge her irises and adjusted a tangerine wig to transform into "Jesse", a character from the romance quest mobile game "Light and Night".&nbsp;</p>

<p>A tall and sensitive musician, he is one of five characters that woo players throughout the game -- and for client Feng Xinyu, a vivacious 19-year-old, the ideal partner.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I don't have a boyfriend because I'm not interested in 3D men," Feng told AFP, using a term for real-life men as opposed to those on the page or screen.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I like anime characters a little bit more, they're more appealing to me."</p>

<p>"Light and Night", made by tech giant Tencent and aimed squarely at young women, promises a "brand-new interactive experience of highly immersive love".</p>

<p>Players like Feng, who form strong emotional connections with characters in such games, are known as "dream girls" -- and cos commissioning takes the immersion to the next level by dragging those 2D beaus off the screen and into the real world.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Feng has commissioned Xu twice before, for a fee of around $70.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Last month, she spent $2,800 on a multi-day trip with another Jesse cosplayer to a different province.</p>

<p>But she decided she preferred Xu's portrayal and hired her for a third date.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We really click," Feng said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"She's just like the character from the game, it feels like we were meant to be together."</p>

<p><strong>'Reconstructing gender rules'</strong></p>

<p>Feng was waiting for Xu at a metro station, and grinned in unabashed delight when she spotted her.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The two appeared relaxed, holding hands and chatting happily as they headed to their first activity.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Their date -- all planned and paid for entirely by Feng -- lasted all day, beginning with tea and ending with a hotpot meal and a romantic stroll.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At both a doll-painting workshop and cake-decorating class they attended, they were one of many cos commission pairs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Staff at the latter business told AFP they had noticed more and more couples coming in over the past year -- sometimes dozens on busy days.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Part of the appeal, experts studying the phenomenon say, is that it gives young women a way to perform an idealised heteronormative relationship.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Conservative social attitudes towards women remain widespread in China, often reinforced by state media and popular culture.</p>

<p>Aside from assuaging safety concerns, hiring a female cosplayer ensures a level of equality and understanding not necessarily guaranteed in a real-life relationship.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I don't think it's important what gender the person being commissioned is," Fudan University's Tian Qian told AFP.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"What is important is that (the cosplayer) is a vessel, because the client needs a vehicle for their emotions."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another academic, Zhou Zixing, wrote that cos commissioning allows women "to gain a voice that is fully respected by the opposite sex... responding to, breaking, and reconstructing the gender rules of the real world".</p>

<p><strong>'Low-quality guys'</strong></p>

<p>At the cake-decorating class, Feng leaned over the table, fondly watching Xu pipe generous amounts of icing onto a sponge cake.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Afterwards, Xu gently helped Feng remove her apron, modelling Jesse's gentlemanly behaviour. &nbsp;</p>

<p>"The guys in the games are all quality guys," said Xu.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I think (clients) will be able to improve their requirements in real life in terms of what they want from a man, so that they don't settle for low-quality guys."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Her mother Fang Xiuqing admitted her initial reaction when she learned what Xu was doing was: "How could this happen to my daughter?"&nbsp;</p>

<p>But she has since come around to the idea.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I don't think it's a profession, it's a hobby," said Fang.</p>

<p>"She gets enjoyment from it, and she also brings joy to others."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Fudan University's Tian said cos commissions can act as "emotional sustenance".&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Although this is a paid interaction, it still gives a sense of being seen, which has a certain healing effect to it."&nbsp;</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 40-year-old female school teacher was allegedly shot and killed in front of her father after she refused a marriage proposal, ARY News reported.</p>

<p>The incident occurred in the Jangdara Totalai area of Buner in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, where the suspect opened fire on the teacher and fled the scene.</p>

<p>The local police have registered a first information report (FIR) and launched an investigation, as reported by ARY News.</p>

<p>According to the victim's father, the suspect had previously attacked his daughter, and despite reporting the incident to the police, no action was taken.</p>

<p>This comes amid rising crime cases across different parts of Pakistan.</p>

<p>Similar incidents were reported in the month of June as well.</p>

<p>In a similar incident in the Mardan district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa on June 8, a female school teacher, who contracted free-will marriage was killed in the name of 'honour.'</p>

<p>The incident occurred in the Tazagram area of Mardan district in which the 22-year-old woman was killed after being dragged out of a car, according to details.</p>

<p>Further, as per the police information, the teacher was killed in the name of honour, nine months after she had a court marriage.</p>

<p>The police started the investigation as evidence from the crime scene had been collected. The woman's dead body has been sent to the hospital for medico-legal formalities, according to ARY News.</p>

<p>The attackers managed to escape after the murder and are still at large.</p>

<p>On June 4, two sisters, who contracted free will marriages, were killed in the name of 'honour'.</p>

<p>According to the District Police Officer (DPO), the two sisters had married boys they loved against the wishes of their family. They were brought back due to a decision made by a "Panchayat."</p>

<p>The police said that the sisters were killed by their father, brother, and uncle.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 19-year-old bodybuilder from Brazil was found dead at his home on Sunday afternoon, allegedly due to a heart attack, according to various reports.</p>

<p>Matheus Pavlak had transformed his body in just five years after taking up the sport to overcome obesity. He was a regular competitor and a rising star in the bodybuilding community, particularly in the southern Brazilian state of Santa Catarina, where he lived. According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.tmz.com/2024/09/03/bodybuilder-matheus-pavlak-dead/" rel="No follow, No index ">TMZ</a>, he recently placed fourth and sixth in regional competitions and won the U23 contest in 2023, becoming "Mr. Blumenau" in his hometown.</p>

<p>Pavlak's untimely death has sparked speculation about the role of anabolic steroids in triggering health issues. Critics on social media have highlighted his impressive physique at such a young age, suggesting that the use of performance-enhancing drugs may have contributed to his heart attack.</p>

<p>One acquaintance of Pavlak responded to these accusations on social media, stating, "How can human beings exist who are capable of offending the memory of a boy who is no longer here to defend himself!!"</p>

<p>Pavlak had previously posted pictures of his incredible body transformation, accompanied by the caption, "No matter how difficult or impossible your dream is, if you really want it, you will get there. I DID."</p>

<p>Pavlak's former trainer, Lucas Chegatti, expressed his grief over the loss of his protégé. On Instagram, Chegatti wrote, "Today ends in a sad day with the loss of a great friend, a spectacular young man who leaves us far too soon, a tragedy that has taken us by surprise. He had a brilliant future ahead of him as a respected athlete. God has his plans, but it's hard to understand; I don't have the words to explain the weight I feel in my heart."</p>

<p>Chegatti continued, "I was Matheus' first coach, and I'm very proud to have had the opportunity to care for him like a son. I promised him that one day he would beat me, and said and done, the first time we competed against each other, he ended up winning." Chegatti met Pavlak in 2022.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Pakistan government has issued an order barring all government employees from using social media without permission to stop disclosure of official information and documents, The News International reported.</p>

<p>According to an office memorandum issued by the Establishment Division, government employees have been asked to adhere to the instruction under the Government Servants (Conduct) Rules, 1964. As per the order, the government employees will not be allowed to use any social media platform without permission, The News International reported.</p>

<p>The memorandum stated, "Government employees cannot express opinions or facts that affect the reputation of the government," adding that employees are not permitted to speak against government policy, decisions, national sovereignty and dignity.</p>

<p>It further stated that public servants cannot share their opinions or rhetoric on social media platforms without permission. Strict action would be taken against government employees for violating the directives issued in the order, according to The News International report.</p>

<p>According to the memorandum, a government employee cannot share official documents and information with unrelated persons. It stated that employees cannot speak to the media in a way that impacts Pakistan's ties with other nations.</p>

<p>The memorandum stated, "Civil servants have often been seen debating on social media. The guidelines are not intended to ban the positive use of social media." According to the memorandum, institutions have been asked to monitor their social media platforms to remove objectionable content.</p>

<p>The memorandum stated, "Government servants of all services and groups are bound to follow the instructions. Violation may lead to misconduct proceedings against the employees concerned," according to the report. It asked federal secretaries, additional secretaries, heads of departments, and chief secretaries to execute the memorandum.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Brazilian influencer, who has spent over $1 million on cosmetic procedures to resemble Kim Kardashian, is now warning others about the dangers of&nbsp;butt fillers. Jennifer Pamplona, a self-proclaimed ''surgery addict'', revealed that polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), a common cosmetic material used in butt lift fillers took away her chances of having children. Although her infertility is not directly attributed to PMMA, her complications are believed to be linked to either improper application or an adverse reaction, the <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/08/29/lifestyle/woman-says-butt-lift-filler-left-her-infertile-in-constant-agony-my-limitations-are-severe/" rel="nofollow, noindex">New York Post </a></em>reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Notably, PMMA can migrate from the injection site to other areas, including the pelvic region, potentially affecting reproductive organ function. Ms Pamplona claims to have experienced such an adverse reaction a decade ago, when PMMA spread from her buttocks to her reproductive organs during a bioplasty procedure, leading to her current fertility issues.</p>

<p>''I always dreamed of being a mother. Unfortunately, I now find myself unable to fulfil this dream due to the complications caused by PMMA,'' she told&nbsp;<em>Need To Know.</em></p>

<p>Her surgeon, Dr. Carlos Rios said that medical mishap became a “matter of life or death.”</p>

<p>''The symptoms she exhibited were a direct consequence of this procedure. She was hanging by a thread. The suffering is immense, and the pain of not being able to create life is something I never imagined facing,'' he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Fortunately, her health has been improving, thanks to a holistic approach that includes meditation, a balanced diet, targeted supplementation, and medication.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The social media influencer, who has 1 million followers on Instagram, began her plastic surgery journey at just 17 years old, with over 30 procedures on her body and face. However, it wasn't until her 2022 diagnosis with body dysmorphia that she decided to stop the surgeries. While she may consider one final reconstructive surgery to address some of the lingering issues, Ms Pamplona is currently dealing with the adverse effects of her previous surgeries.&nbsp;</p>

<p>''I like to say that if everyone paid attention to their emotional health, procedures would be less frequent,'' she said.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Four Indians, including a woman, have died in a massive crash involving five vehicles in Texas. The victims had connected through a carpooling app and were on their way to Bentonville in Arkansas on Friday when the tragedy struck. The crash led to a fire in the SUV they were in, and their bodies were charred. Authorities are relying on DNA testing to confirm their identities.</p>

<p>The victims are Aryan Raghunath Orampati, Farooq Shaik, Lokesh Palacharla, and Dharshini Vasudevan. Orampati and his friend Shaik were returning after visiting his cousin in Dallas. Lokesh Palacharla was traveling to Bentonville to meet his wife. Dharshini Vasudevan, who had finished her Master's from the University of Texas and had been working in the US, was going to visit her uncle in Bentonville. They connected through a carpooling app and this helped authorities identify them.</p>

<p>Darshini Vasudevan's father had tagged External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar in a Twitter post three days back and sought help in locating his daughter.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Dear Sir, My daughter Dharshini Vasudevan holding Indian passport No-T6215559 have been in USA for the last 3 years, 2 years of MS studies and later 1 year of Employment and stays 3150 Avenue of the stars Apt 1110-Frisco,Texas-75034.</p>

<p>"Yesterday evening she took a car pooling along with 3 others around 3pm till 4pm she was actively messaging and reachable on phone after 4pm no further contacts could be established with her as well other 3 people who were travelling with her," he said in the post.</p>

<p>Orampati's father Subhash Chandra Reddy owns a Hyderabad-based firm named Max Agri Genetics Private Limited. Aryan completed his engineering degree at Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham in Coimbatore. "His parents were in the US in May for his convocation at the University of Texas. After the convocation, they asked him to return to India, but he said he wanted to work in the US for two more years. Fate has struck like this," said a relative.</p>

<p>Orampati's friend Shaik, too, was from Hyderabad and lived in Bentonville. Darshini, from Tamil Nadu, was living in Frisco, Texas.</p>

<p>Farooq Shaik's father Masthan Vali said he went to the US three years back. "He went to the US to complete his MS degree. He finished it recently." Mr Vali is a retired private employee and the family lives in BHEL Hyderabad. "My daughter also lives in US and is handling the situation."</p>

<p>According to reports, a speeding truck rear-ended the SUV the victims were in. The car burst into flames and all the occupants burnt to death. The authorities are relying on DNA fingerprinting and teeth and bone remains to confirm the identities. "DNA fingerprinting will be done to identify the bodies, and the samples will be matched with the parents," a local authority said.</p>

<p>A long weekend in the US has delayed the identification process, prolonging the suffering of the victims' families.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>During a live circus performance, Russian trainer Sergei Prichinich narrowly escaped death when a female brown bear named Donut, weighing over 490 pounds, suddenly attacked him. The horrified audience, filled with parents and children, watched in terror as the bear, who was riding a hoverboard as part of her act, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://x.com/peta/status/1829184288254001297">viciously attacked Mr Prichinich</a>, pinning him to the ground for approximately half a minute, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/09/03/world-news/angry-bear-attacks-circus-trainer-in-front-of-terrified-crowd/" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>New York Post</em> </a>reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, he desperately tried to defend himself, holding a bar between the bear's jaws and his body. Just as the situation seemed dire, a worker outside the cage intervened, jabbing at the bear and distracting her long enough for Prichinich to break free. The bear backed off, giving Prichinich a narrow escape from the terrifying ordeal.</p>

<p>Nikita Mikhailov, director of the Moretti Circus, confirmed that the show resumed without further incident after the horrific episode.&nbsp;</p>

<p>''Towards the end of the act, the bear snapped at Sergei and wrestled with him. Their performance continued,'' he said. He noted that the tamer ''waited for the bear to calm down, got up, continued the routine with her, sealed it with a kiss, and that was it.''&nbsp;</p>

<p>He also praised Mr Prichinich for his quick thinking and professional handling of the situation.&nbsp;''This is an animal, and they can behave differently, they may not like something, but they can express their emotions this way. Every trainer understands this,'' Mr Mikhailov added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While everyone was relieved that the trainer escaped unhurt, Russian animal rights activist Yuri Koretskikh renewed his calls for a complete ban on live animal performances, citing the inherent risks and dangers posed to humans and animals in such shows.</p>

<p>''While modern world circus art is rapidly moving towards humanity, banning the use of animals in circuses, the Russian circus lobby is actively resisting progress, defending its commercial interests,” Mr Koretskikh said.</p>

<p>In Russia, animal rights have been a pressing concern, prompting President Vladimir Putin to sign a bill outlawing animal cruelty in 2018. Although the legislation doesn't address animal performance, activists have continued to focus on this issue. Last year, the Russian Duma proposed a bill to prohibit the use of animals in circuses nationwide. The bill is set to be presented to the lower chamber in October.&nbsp;</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Australia's air safety investigators have recommended reforms after a Brisbane air traffic controller was found asleep at his desk while covering an early-morning shift. According to a report by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB), the staffer was managing the Cairns Terminal Control Unit (TCU) from Airservices Australia's Brisbane office when he was discovered asleep by the oncoming air traffic controller who was working the day shift. The incident took place in December 2022. In its report, released Tuesday, the ATSB blamed multiple consecutive night shifts and an ineffective fatigue risk management system for the incident.</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.atsb.gov.au/media/news-items/2024/fatigue-management-improvements-underway-after-brisbane-centre-controller-found-asleep-end-their-night-shift" rel="noindex, nofollow">ATSB</a>, the staffer was found lying across two chairs and under a blanket at the end of a night shift. The employee had worked their seventh night shift in nine days as an approach controller for Cairns airport from the Brisbane control centre, with the shift starting at 10 pm and running until 6 am. The staffer had completed 10 night shifts in 12 days. The report stated that there were no planes in the area at the time and ATSB was unable to determine when the employee went to sleep.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sharing the investigation report details on X, ATSB wrote, "A Brisbane Centre air traffic controller who was found asleep at their workstation towards the end of their shift had worked multiple consecutive night shifts resulting in sleep debt, an ATSB investigation report details."&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to the press note, ATSB Chief Commissioner Angus Mitchell said there were several factors contributing to the staffer falling asleep on the job but stressed the staffer's fatigue was a key component as they had worked 10-night shifts in the previous 12 days.</p>

<p>"The controller had also been working multiple night shifts with reduced extended rest periods, which likely reduced their ability to obtain restorative sleep," Mr Mitchell said.</p>

<p>Alongside the staffer's fatigue, the ATSB noted the time of day the controller was working, the low workload in a night shift, the employee not undertaking mental alertness activities and lying down on two chairs under a blanket. It also said that the controller may have experienced "sleep inertia" after waking up, impacting their ability to communicate and make decisions during an instance where traffic infringes on their airspace.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"There were no negative consequences from this occurrence, but it does highlight areas for improvement in work scheduling and fatigue risk management," said Mr Mitchell.</p>

<p>The ATSB report further criticised an "over-reliance" on short-term changes to manage the airport roster "likely due to an underlying lack of resources within Airservices Australia". "As a result, cumulative fatigue was not being effectively managed strategically, and an over-reliance on tactical principles did not identify or manage fatigue risks arising from the work schedule," it added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, after the incident, Airservices upped its overall number of air traffic controllers, the Guardian reported. The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also announced changes to its fatigue risk management system requirement and is working alongside Airservices to bolster its approach to staffer fatigue.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mr Mitchell called on other sectors of the transport industry to put the spotlight on fatigue as a danger in the workplace. "Fatigue remains one of the most relevant ongoing concerns for safe transport, despite increased awareness across the transport sector," he said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US Commerce Department said Tuesday it plans to award $50 million to HP to support the expansion and modernization of an existing company facility in Oregon that will boost key semiconductor technologies.</p>

<p>The proposed funding will support technologies that serve life sciences instrumentation and technology hardware used in artificial intelligence applications and other projects, the department said.</p>

<p>Congress in August 2022 approved a $39 billion subsidy program for U.S. semiconductor manufacturing and related components along with $75 billion in government lending authority and a 25% investment tax credit worth an estimated $24 billion.</p>

<p>The projects build on HP's expertise in microfluidics and microelectromechanical systems with funding set to support manufacturing of silicon devices critical in life sciences lab equipment used in drug discovery, singlecell research, and cell line development.</p>

<p>Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said the proposed $50 million funding for the Corvallis, Oregon, HP campus "shows how we are investing in every part of the semiconductor supply chain and how important semiconductor technology is to innovation in drug discovery and critical life science equipment."</p>

<p>The department said the technology will boost partner institutions including Harvard Medical School, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Merck.</p>

<p>HP CEO Enrique Lores said the funding "provides HP with an opportunity to modernize and expand our facility to further invest in our microfluidics technology."</p>

<p>The department has announced term sheets with 17 companies offering more than $32 billion in grants and up to $29 billion in loans.</p>

<p>It also made other major planned awards including $6.4 billion to South Korea's Samsung to expand chip production in Texas.</p>

<p>Intel won $8.5 billion in grants in March while Taiwan's TSMC clinched $6.6 billion to build out its American production and memory chip maker Micron Technology won $6.1 billion to help fund domestic chip factory projects.</p>

<p>All the awards have yet to be finalized and amounts could change after the Commerce Department conducts due diligence.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Henry, the crocodile, got his name from the famous hunter, Sir Henry Neumann, who was once appointed to kill him. ]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An enormous 16ft beast weighing 700 kg and fathering thousands of hatchlings is now recognised as the world's oldest crocodile. Meet Henry, the man-eating Nile crocodile, who at 123 years old has sired over 10,000 babies with his six ‘wives,' according to the zoo where he lives.<br />
<br />
Henry's journey began in the Okavango Delta, Botswana, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, where he was born on December 16, 1900, as per the Sun. Renowned for his terrifying fang-like teeth and massive frame, Henry is now believed to be the largest living crocodile, with a length that almost matches a minibus. However, his past is far from ordinary.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
In the early 1900s, Henry developed a notorious reputation among the local tribes in Botswana, where he allegedly preyed on human children. The tribes, desperate to end his bloodthirsty reign, sought the help of a famed hunter, Sir Henry Neumann, after whom the crocodile was named. Rather than killing the beast, Mr Neumann captured Henry, sentencing him to a lifetime of captivity.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
For the past three decades, Henry has lived at the Crocworld Conservation Centre in Scottburgh, South Africa. There, he continues to awe visitors with his size and age, making him one of the oldest crocodiles in captivity. His dark, man-eating past is a stark contrast to his current life as a zoo attraction, where he is admired from a safe distance.<br />
<br />
Henry is a Nile crocodile, a species found in 26 countries across Sub-Saharan Africa. These apex predators, known for their fierce nature, are responsible for hundreds of deaths in the region each year.<br />
<br />
While Henry is the oldest crocodile, the largest belongs to Cassius, a 16 ft saltwater crocodile living in Australia. Cassius, captured in 1984, has become a star attraction at the Marineland Melanesia Crocodile Habitat on Green Island, off the coast of Queensland.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At least six Ukrainian officials including cabinet ministers submitted their resignation on Tuesday and a presidential aide was dismissed, as the ruling party signalled a major government reshuffle was underway.</p>

<p>The reset comes as Kyiv faces growing challenges including daily Russian bombardment and as President Volodymyr Zelensky seeks to boost confidence in the government two and a half years into Moscow's invasion.</p>

<p>"As promised, a major government reset can be expected this week. More than 50 percent of the Cabinet of Ministers' staff will be changed," David Arakhamia, the head of the ruling Servant of the People party's parliamentary faction wrote on Telegram.</p>

<p>"Tomorrow we will have a day of dismissals, and the day after that a day of appointments," he said.</p>

<p>Several Ukrainian ministers had already submitted their resignation by Tuesday evening, including the Minister for Strategic Industries, Minister for Justice and Minister of Environmental Protection.</p>

<p>The head of Ukraine's State Property Fund, Vitaliy Koval, also resigned, as did Deputy Prime Ministers Iryna Vereshchuk and Olga Stefanishyna.</p>

<p>The deputy head of Zelensky's office and one of the president's top aides, Rostyslav Shurma, was meanwhile dismissed, according to a presidential decree.</p>

<p>Zelensky has ordered several reshuffles since the war began, sacking his defence minister last September after a series of corruption scandals and more recently replacing his top commander amid setbacks on the battlefield.</p>

<p>The Ukrainian leader's first presidential term, which began in 2019, expired in May but he has remained in post under martial law.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A California doctor and a woman charged with illegally supplying the drug ketamine to "Friends" star Matthew Perry before his overdose death will face trial in March, according to court documents released on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Dr. Salvador Plasencia, and Jasveen Sangha, whom authorities said was a drug dealer known to customers as the "ketamine queen," have pleaded not guilty to charges related to the October 2023 death of Perry.</p>

<p>An autopsy determined that the 54-year-old died from "acute effects" of ketamine and other factors that caused him to lose consciousness and drown in his hot tub.</p>

<p>Ketamine is a short-acting anesthetic with hallucinogenic properties, sometimes prescribed to treat depression and anxiety but also abused by recreational users.</p>

<p>Perry had publicly acknowledged decades of substance abuse, including during the years he starred as Chandler Bing on the hit 1990s television sitcom "Friends."</p>

<p>Plasencia and Sangha are scheduled be tried together in federal court in Los Angeles starting on March 4.</p>

<p>Three other defendants have agreed to plead guilty in connection with Perry's death.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United States has charged leaders of the armed Palestinian group Hamas with a raft of "terrorism" offenses, federal court documents unsealed on Tuesday revealed.</p>

<p>Six men -- including Hamas chief Yahya Sinwar and late political leader Ismail Haniyeh, who was killed in late July in Tehran -- were named in the charging document dated February 1, accused of "conspiracy to provide material support for acts of terrorism resulting in death" along with six other counts.</p>

<p>The document also contained a request for the arrest of the individuals.</p>

<p>Hamas, which is designated a "terrorist organization" by Washington, launched an unprecedented attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, triggering the brutal ongoing war in the Gaza Strip, which is controlled by the Palestinian group.</p>

<p>"The charges unsealed today are just one part of our effort to target every aspect of Hamas's operations. These actions will not be our last," US Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement.</p>

<p>"Yahya Sinwar and the other senior leaders of Hamas are charged today with orchestrating this terrorist organization's decades-long campaign of mass violence and terror -- including on October 7th."</p>

<p>Israel's campaign against Hamas has so far killed at least 40,819 people in Gaza, according to the territory's health ministry. The UN rights office says most of the dead are women and children.</p>

<p>The October 7 attack on Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,205 people, mostly civilians and including hostages killed in captivity, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Airbnb on Tuesday asked New York City to reconsider regulations on short-term rentals that went into effect in September 2023, citing higher prices for travelers and zero impact on the housing market.</p>

<p>In a blog post, Airbnb said Local Law LL18, which states hosts must be permanent occupants of the units being rented and must register with the city before posting rentals, has "failed to combat the housing crisis".</p>

<p>After the implementation of the law, the number of Airbnb listings allowing stays under 30 nights has fallen 83%, according to an August report by data analytics firm Airdna.</p>

<p>Airbnb, citing data from Apartment List, said vacancy rates for apartments in New York City have remained virtually unchanged at 3.4% since the law took effect.</p>

<p>The company also said the cost of travel has increased. Hotel rates in New York City were up 7.4% year-over-year in July, compared with 2.1% across the U.S., according to data from Co-Star, Airbnb said.</p>

<p>"By rolling back parts of the law, the city can increase the supply of accommodations for consumers, support resident hosts and revitalize local businesses that depend on tourism dollars," Airbnb added.</p>

<p>The New York City mayor's office and the Office of Special Enforcement were not immediately available for comment.</p>

<p>Last year, a New York judge dismissed the company's lawsuit against New York City over the local law.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump is to plead not guilty to the charges in a revised indictment accusing him of seeking to overturn the results of the 2020 US presidential election, according to a court filing on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Trump, in a filing with the US District Court in Washington, waived his right to be present at his arraignment on the charges and instructed his attorneys to plead not guilty.</p>

<p>Special Counsel Jack Smith filed a new indictment of the Republican White House candidate last week on the charges that he tried to subvert the results of the election he lost to Democrat Joe Biden.</p>

<p>The superseding indictment retains the same four charges against Trump as in an earlier version but takes into account a recent Supreme Court ruling that a former president has broad immunity from criminal prosecution.</p>

<p>District Judge Tanya Chutkan granted Trump's request not to appear in person at the arraignment and said it will be held at the same time as a status conference in the case on Thursday.</p>

<p>The new indictment of the 78-year-old Trump removes material affected by the presidential immunity ruling from the conservative-dominated top court.</p>

<p>It retains the same core, stating that Trump lost in 2020 but "was determined to remain in power" and attempted to subvert the results.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court ruled in July that an ex-president has broad immunity from prosecution for official acts conducted while in office, but can be pursued for unofficial acts.</p>

<p>Trump's lawyers have been seeking to delay a trial until after November's election between Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential candidate.</p>

<p>Trump is accused of conspiracy to defraud the United States and conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding -- the January 6, 2021, joint session of Congress that was attacked by Trump supporters.</p>

<p>Trump is also accused of seeking to disenfranchise US voters with his campaign of false claims that he won the 2020 election.</p>

<p>He was originally scheduled to go on trial on March 4, but that was put on hold while his lawyers pushed his claim of presidential immunity all the way up to the Supreme Court.</p>

<p>Trump was convicted in New York in May of 34 counts of falsifying business records to cover up hush money payments made to porn star Stormy Daniels.</p>

<p>Sentencing has been scheduled for September 18.</p>

<p>Trump also faces charges in Georgia related to efforts to overturn the 2020 election.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A former aide to New York Governor Kathy Hochul has been arrested today and charged with acting as an undisclosed agent of China, federal prosecutors in Brooklyn said.</p>

<p>Linda Sun had served as the deputy chief of staff to Ms Hochul for a year. The 41-year-old has also been accused of visa fraud, alien smuggling and money laundering conspiracy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is alleged that while working in the state government, Ms Sun blocked Taiwanese government's representatives from meeting officials and sought to organise a high-level New York state official's visit to China.</p>

<p>"In return for these and other actions, Ms Sun received substantial economic and other benefits from representatives of the People's Republic of China (PRC) government and the Chinese Communist Party," the US Attorney's Office said in a press release.</p>

<p>Her husband Chris Hu has also been arrested. The prosecutors said the Chinese government facilitated millions of dollars in transactions for Mr Hu, who carried out business activities in China.</p>

<p>Ms Sun also received several gifts, including Nanjing-style salted ducks prepared by a Chinese government official's chef, prosecutors added.</p>

<p>Ms Sun and Mr Hu laundered the proceeds of their scheme to purchase a $4.1 million property in New York, a $2.1 million condominium in Hawaii and various luxury automobiles, including a 2024 Ferrari, the US Attorney's Office said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said on Tuesday the 2025 state budget will feature steep spending cuts as the government tries to balance fiscal responsibility with a need to finance Israel's ongoing war with Hamas in Gaza.</p>

<p>The minister has been under pressure from the Bank of Israel and investors seeking clarity on fiscal policy for next year. The central bank has been calling for spending cuts and tax hikes or other ways to bring in more revenue. But Smotrich has said that during a war it was wrong to raise taxes.</p>

<p>Speaking at a news conference, Smotrich outlined only his main focus points while formulating the budget, which he said would be ready for a cabinet vote in early October and an initial parliamentary vote in mid-November. Full approval by lawmakers would be at the end of December, he said.</p>

<p>"We are in the longest and most expensive war in Israel's history with expenses of 200 to 250 billion shekels ($54-$68 billion)," Smotrich said.</p>

<p>"We are not limiting war spending and we will support the war effort until victory," he said. "Without victory, there will not be security and without security, there will be no economy."</p>

<p>The war, triggered by Hamas attacks on Israel, has raged since October 7 with little signs of a near-term ceasefire.</p>

<p>To finance the war, Smotrich plans broad spending reductions of 35 billion shekels in 2025, along with a freeze in tax rates, benefits and wages. He sees a budget deficit of 4% of gross domestic product, down from a 6.6% of GDP target in 2024.</p>

<p>The deficit reached 8.1% in July and is expected to grow further in August but Smotrich said it will come back to its target by year end.</p>

<p>Three credit rating agencies lowered Israel's credit rating this year and Smotrich has also been accused of not managing the economy well with scant growth of 1.2% in the second quarter.</p>

<p>Smotrich said the shekel was far stronger than prior to the war, the stock market was doing well and high tech investments have recovered, with the jobless rate at 2.8%.</p>

<p>A rise in inflation to 3.2% was temporary, and mainly due to supply factors stemming from the war, he said.</p>

<p>An economic plan accompanying the budget will include support for the high-tech sector, a streamlining of the public sector, measures to fight tax evasion and a diversification of capital sources.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After remarrying at the age of 93, a man from Shanghai regretted his decision to sign a contract giving his flat to a coworker in exchange for care and companionship. The man, whose last name is Tan, went to court with his former care giver and coworker, Gu, but his request to get his property restored was denied, according to the <em>South China Morning Post.</em></p>

<p>Tan and Gu's family formed a support arrangement in 2005, when Tan promised to give them his flat in return for their company and attention. His demands included regular phone calls from Gu and his family, a weekly visit, grocery and clothing purchases, and taking care of him while he was ill. In return, Tan wrote in his will that he would bequeath his flat and its contents to Gu instead of his children, the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scmp.com/news/people-culture/trending-china/article/3276830/china-man-agreed-gift-home-colleague-companionship-changes-mind-after-remarriage-93?module=top_story&amp;pgtype=section"><em>SCMP reported.</em></a></p>

<p>"They cared about me more than my family. They helped me get through illness and pain and made my life rich and happy," Tan wrote.</p>

<br />
Tan said he was not on good terms with his children, who he felt had not fulfilled the duty of support.</p>

<p>Tan also signed a purchase contract with Gu in 2005, selling his flat to Gu for 200,000 yuan (US$28,000). The size of the unit was not revealed in the report.</p>

<p>The average housing price in Shanghai in 2005 was 6,700 yuan per square meter, according to the Shanghai Statistics Bureau.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Islamic State group claimed on Tuesday a suicide attack in the Afghan capital that killed six people a day earlier, saying it had targeted the Taliban government's prosecution service.</p>

<p>The explosion in Kabul's southern outskirts on Monday afternoon killed at least six people and wounded 13 more, according to the city's police.</p>

<p>The IS group's Amaq media wing said in a statement on the Telegram messaging app that "the suicide bomber waited until the time when the prosecutor's employees were leaving their shifts" before detonating in the middle of a crowd.</p>

<p>It put the combined figure of dead and wounded at "more than 45" and said the bombing was committed "to avenge Muslims held in Taliban prisons".</p>

<p>Afghanistan's Taliban authorities have declared security their highest priority since surging back to power following the chaotic withdrawal of US-led foreign forces three years ago.</p>

<p>While their sweeping security operations have led to a decline in militants challenging their rule, according to analysts, the regional IS chapter known as Islamic State Khorasan (IS-K) remains a threat.</p>

<p>The group has targeted Taliban government ministries, foreign embassies and religious minorities.</p>

<p>The previous suicide attack in Afghanistan claimed by IS-K was in the southern city of Kandahar -- the Taliban's historic stronghold -- in March.</p>

<p>Taliban authorities said only three people were killed in that attack, while a hospital source put the toll at 20. Such discrepancies are not uncommon.</p>

<p>Taliban government spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid told AFP last month that IS "existed here before but we suppressed them very hard".</p>

<p>"No such groups exist here that can pose a threat to anyone," he said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

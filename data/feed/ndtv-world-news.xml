       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A man, clinging to a cooler in the aftermath of Hurricane Milton, was saved by a Coast Guard helicopter crew on October 10, around 48 kilometres off Longboat Key. The <a href="https://www.news.uscg.mil/Press-Releases/Article/3933279/coast-guard-rescues-man-off-longboat-key-following-hurricane-milton/">rescue operation</a> took place around 1:30 pm and the man was airlifted to Tampa General Hospital for medical evaluation. He was found wearing a life jacket, which played a big role in his survival during the storm.</p>

<p>The Coast Guard's Air Station Miami launched the search mission on Thursday morning after receiving reports of a missing captain. The aircrew, alongside support from Air Station Clearwater, was positioned at the Aviation Training Center Mobile for storm avoidance during Hurricane Milton.</p>

<p>The captain, aboard the fishing vessel Capt. Dave initially contacted Coast Guard Sector St. Petersburg on the afternoon of October 7. He reported that he and a crew member were stranded about 32 kilometres&nbsp;off John's Pass. The Coast Guard promptly dispatched a rescue boat and a helicopter, bringing the pair to safety and then to Air Station Clearwater without injury. Capt. Dave was left adrift while salvage arrangements were made.</p>

<p>On October 9, the vessel's owner notified the Coast Guard that the captain went out to the boat for repairs in the early hours and had not been heard since. However, after a connection was re-established with the captain, he reported that his vessel's rudder had become fouled with a line, rendering the boat inoperable.</p>

<p>At the time, sea conditions were challenging, with 6 to 8-foot waves and winds of about 48 kmph. However, the weather rapidly worsened as Hurricane Milton approached. The Coast Guard instructed the captain to wear a life jacket and remain near the vessel's emergency position indicating a radio beacon. Unfortunately, communication was lost on the evening of October 9.</p>

<p>“This man survived in a nightmare scenario for even the most experienced mariner,” said Lt. Cmdr. Dana Grady, chief of the command centre at Sector St. Petersburg. “To understand the severity of the hurricane conditions, we estimate he experienced approximately 75-90 mph winds, 20-25 foot seas, for an extended period of time to include overnight. He survived because of a life jacket, his emergency position indicating locator beacon, and a cooler.”</p>

<p>Hurricane Milton made landfall on October 9 near Siesta Key, a barrier island located just south of Sarasota on Florida's central west coast. Initially, the storm struck as a formidable Category 3 hurricane, with sustained winds reaching approximately 193 kmph. However, as it moved inland, it weakened to a Category 2 storm.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Elon Musk on Thursday unveiled what he said was a robotaxi capable of self-driving, predicting it would be available by 2027 -- about a decade after he first promised an autonomous vehicle.</p>

<p>The Tesla CEO said the fully electric car -- which has no steering wheel or pedals -- would be priced under $30,000, would be charged wirelessly with inductive technology and would be "10 to 20 times safer" than human-driven cars.</p>

<p>"You can think of the car in an autonomous world as being like just a little lounge," he told a crowd at the Warner Brothers Studio lot near Los Angeles.</p>

<p>"You're just sitting in a comfortable little lounge, and you can do whatever you want while you're in this comfortable little lounge, and when you get out, you will be at your destination."</p>

<p>Few details were given about the vehicle, whose gullwing doors are reminiscent of the Delorean made famous by the "Back to the Future" films, but Musk said Tesla already had 50 of them.</p>

<p>He said the company was expecting to begin "fully autonomous, unsupervised" driving in Texas and California next year with existing models, and then move on to production of what he called the "cybercab".</p>

<p>"I tend to be a little optimistic with time frames, but in 2026, so yeah, before 2027. Let me put it that way."</p>

<p><strong>Robovan and Optimus robot</strong></p>

<p>The evening, which started almost an hour late, was heavy on sunny visions of the future, but light on specifics.</p>

<p>But it also showcased a mass passenger vehicle that Musk called "The Robovan."</p>

<p>The vehicle, which looks like an enormous moving toaster, has no steering wheel, pedals or driver.</p>

<p>It can seat up to 20 people or could be converted to carry goods, Musk said.</p>

<p>He gave no details about production or any timeline.</p>

<p>Musk also brought out dancing humanoid robots called Optimus that he said would one day be able to do menial tasks, as well as offer friendship.</p>

<p>"I think this will be the biggest product ever of any kind," he said, adding that he expected the robot to retail for $20,000 to $30,000.</p>

<p>He gave no timeline on this, either, and it was not clear from the livestream what the robot's capabilities were, although it was shown walking amongst audience members, handing out plaques and serving drinks.</p>

<p><strong>Trump</strong></p>

<p>Musk's bullish pronouncements and dedicated fanbase have helped build Tesla into one of the world's most valuable companies.</p>

<p>While he was once the darling of the political left for his environmentalist moves towards electrifying transport, he has become increasingly controversial.</p>

<p>Since buying Twitter -- which he renamed X -- the free speech absolutist cut staffing on the platform, leading many long-time users and advertisers to abandon the forum.</p>

<p>And he's currently spending time and money promoting Republican Donald Trump, echoing the billionaire presidential candidate's dire warnings about migrants and a crumbling America, including during an exuberant appearance at a weekend Trump rally that was widely mocked.</p>

<p>Thursday night's robotaxi reveal was a long time coming.</p>

<p>Musk first said in 2016 a fully automated car was two years away; a year later he was touting a vehicle by 2019 so clever that customers would be able to sleep while it drove them around.</p>

<p>But as many automakers have found, self-driving is tricky.</p>

<p>While lots of cars nowadays have limited automation, theoretically allowing the driver to cede some of the boring bits of driving to an onboard computer, the person behind the wheel still has to pay attention and jump in if the car does something unpredictable.</p>

<p>That's because computers, unlike people, are not very good at reacting to unexpected events or situations they have never seen before.</p>

<p>Other companies, such as Google's Waymo and General Motors' Cruise, have operated heavily regulated and limited pilot robotaxi programs for a few years already.</p>

<p>Anything Tesla tries to put on the road will face the same kind of regulatory hurdles, as well as skepticism from the general public, many of whom have never seen a car without a driver.</p>

<p>Immediate reaction to the reveals was mixed.</p>

<p>"Delusional nonsense from a liar who has been promising a robotaxi every year for a decade," wrote user @goodandnormal on X.</p>

<p>Others on the platform were more enthusiastic, with some predicting that Tesla's share price will soar when US markets open.</p>

<p>"Tesla self-driving 'Robovan.' The future looks promising," wrote @CollinsEbot1.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Barack Obama cast the Republican nominee Donald Trump as a selfish businessman concerned only with his own accumulation of wealth and power, in contrast with Kamala Harris.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Before Barack Obama's ascent to the White House, Diana Vahabzadeh was a registered Independent who had never voted for a Democrat in her life.</p>

<p>But the first Black president of the United States won the now 63-year-old over during his initial 2008 campaign and she's leaned left ever since.</p>

<p>He was back on the trail Thursday and so was she, along with thousands of people at a rally in Pittsburgh backing Kamala Harris, which kicks off Obama's stumping blitz across swing states vital to winning November's neck-and-neck election.</p>

<p>Vahabzadeh has "loved him for years," she said: "This is a great opportunity to be able to see him and also support the ticket."</p>

<p>A playlist of pop classics and TikTok hits spun in the university gym where the marquee speaker's "Yes We Can" slogan from 2008 was repurposed as "Yes She Can," a message emblazoned on both homemade posters and an electric scoreboard in the field house.</p>

<p>"We love you Barack!" shouted one rallygoer as he appeared, soundtracked by U2's "City of Blinding Lights," a frequent track during his own presidential bids.</p>

<p>Flashing his megawatt smile, Obama cast the Republican nominee <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/has-donald-trump-ever-changed-a-diaper-barack-obama-at-kamala-harris-rally-6764162">Donald Trump as a selfish businessman</a> concerned only with his own accumulation of wealth and power, in contrast with Harris, who he said "is as prepared for the job as any nominee for president as ever been."</p>

<p>"That's who Kamala is."</p>

<p>In closing, he tapped the crowd-rousing vigor that propelled him to the top of the Democratic party decades ago, his voice rapidly amplifying as he dropped his demands: "Do not just sit back and hope for the best -- get off your couch and vote."</p>

<p>"Put down your phone, and vote!" he shouted to cheers. "Vote for Kamala Harris as the next president of the United States."</p>

<p><strong>'Powerful'</strong></p>

<p>The energy hit for Tia Douglas, a 20-year-old college student who was on the cusp of primary-school age when Obama first won office.</p>

<p>"It felt so powerful to be able to hear him speak," she told AFP with bright eyes and a wide smile following the rally.</p>

<p>"Listening to him made me even more excited to get out there in the next 26 days."</p>

<p>The Harris campaign is hoping the 63-year-old former president -- who led the US from 2009 to 2017 -- can imbue their White House bid with star power and help fend off Trump's potential return.</p>

<p>Obama walked out to ardent applause at the Pittsburgh field house, which was packed with a crowd diverse in background and age.</p>

<p>"I love seeing and hearing his articulate self," said Valerie Brown, a 66-year-old retired public schoolteacher.</p>

<p>She told AFP she hopes his words "might stimulate some others who are reluctant" to vote Harris.</p>

<p>Vice President Harris enjoyed a honeymoon surge in the polls when she replaced President Joe Biden as the Democratic nominee over the summer, capturing the social media zeitgeist and raking in a reported billion dollars in fundraising.</p>

<p>But whether she ultimately can bat back Republican Trump, who is seeking a second term and still maintains a fervent base of support, remains anyone's guess, with key battleground states like Pennsylvania still vacillating between the candidates in the polls.</p>

<p>"I get it, why people are looking to shake things up," Obama said onstage, before drawing chuckles after riffing on his own former platform: "I mean, I'm the hopey-changey guy."</p>

<p>"I understand people feeling frustrated and people feeling we can do better," he continued. "What I cannot understand is why anybody would think that Donald Trump will shake things up in a way that is good for you, Pennsylvania."</p>

<p><strong>'Lifetime icon'</strong></p>

<p>In the lead-up to the evening rally supporters snaked around the block of the University of Pittsburgh field house hoping for a spot inside.</p>

<p>To see Harris and Obama "join forces for the greater good," Douglas said, "I think is really amazing."</p>

<p>Douglas's friend Julia Palchikoff, a 20-year-old journalism major, said maturing in the Trump era made her appreciate Obama even more.</p>

<p>"Being in a swing state in an election like this, it's just a historical moment, and I feel like I have to do my part," said the Alaska native who moved to Pennsylvania for school.</p>

<p>"When I heard Obama was coming here, I was, like, I loved him as a kid -- and Kamala, honestly, it just feels like we're on the precipice of something really great."</p>

<p>Was it the Obama she expected?</p>

<p>"It totally was," she said, before lavishing a little more praise on the former leader: "Lifetime icon."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The incident occurred during the Mollie Kathleen Gold Mine Tour, which takes visitors 1,000 feet (300 meters) underground in the western US state.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One person died and a dozen people remain trapped deep in a disused Colorado gold mine after the shaft's elevator system malfunctioned during a tour Thursday, local police said.</p>

<p>The incident occurred during the Mollie Kathleen Gold Mine Tour, which takes visitors 1,000 feet (300 meters) underground in the western US state.</p>

<p>A group of visitors were on board the elevator trolley system when the mechanical failure occurred, killing one person and injuring four.</p>

<p>Officials did not release further details about what went wrong, citing an active investigation.</p>

<p>"We did have one fatality that occurred during this issue at 500 feet," Teller County sheriff Jason Mikesell told a press conference.</p>

<p>The other 11 people on board the elevator at the time, including two children, were brought safely to the surface with the assistance of the mine operators and fire department officials.</p>

<p>Aside from the fatality, the four people hurt in the incident suffered only minor injuries, said Mikesell.</p>

<p>A further 12 people remain in a tunnel at the bottom of the mine.</p>

<p>They are safe and are accompanied by a mine employee, but cannot be moved until the elevator system is cleared as safe to be used again, said Mikesell.</p>

<p>Emergency officials with ropes are standing by in case they are required.</p>

<p>Chairs, blankets, and water have been provided to those in the mine.</p>

<p>"The atmospherics are good inside the tunnel," said Mikesell.</p>

<p>Those still inside the mine have not been informed of the fatality.</p>

<p>"We're just trying to keep down the worry of what's going on, so that nobody gets excited," added Mikesell.</p>

<p>The mine outside the small city of Cripple Creek, around 100 miles south of Denver, offers a chance to "Experience the 'Old West' as it was for hard rock gold miners of 'The World's Greatest Gold Camp,'" according to its official website.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[As gushing water from Hurricane Milton flooded their Florida apartment, Lidier Rodriguez and Sandra Escalona rushed upstairs to safety -- a scene of danger and drama in a normally staid senior living facility.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As gushing water from <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/hurricane-milton-destroys-homes-leaves-2-million-without-power-in-florida-6758554">Hurricane Milton</a> flooded their Florida apartment, Lidier Rodriguez and Sandra Escalona rushed upstairs to safety -- a scene of danger and drama in a normally staid senior living facility.</p>

<p>Hours later, after the powerful storm hit Wednesday evening, they watched as the same emergency crews who rescued them at their residence -- a series of two-story apartment buildings -- helped other older people get out.</p>

<p>The complex is on a low-lying and now flooded street near Tampa Bay on Florida's west coast. Police and firefighters went from building to building in boats on Thursday, helping people get to dry land.</p>

<p>"We lost everything," said Rodriguez, a 54-year-old Cuban man who has been living in Florida for 20 years. "But at least we are alive. That is all we have left."</p>

<p>Outside their homes, dozens of residents look confused and shellshocked -- like they did not know what to do next.</p>

<p>They carried bags with the few belongings they were able to salvage, and in some cases their pet dogs and cats.</p>

<p>No one expected so much flooding in a neighborhood that was not part of the many mandatory evacuation zones that Florida officials declared in the second major hurricane in as many weeks.</p>

<p>The neighborhood was not damaged at all when Hurricane Helene hit late last month.</p>

<p>Milton killed at least 11 people as it churned across the state and then out to the Atlantic. But Floridians heaved a sigh of relief because the storm surge, catastrophic damage and loss of life that many people feared did not materialize in the end.</p>

<p><strong>Now, what?</strong></p>

<p>When Escalona saw a few inches of water on the floor of her home, she first thought a neighbor had left the water running, but soon realized something was very wrong.</p>

<p>"It all happened very quickly. The water rushed in suddenly, it was strong, with a lot of current," Escalona recalled.</p>

<p>"We grabbed some papers and the dog and left. We spent the night outside the door of the neighbors upstairs," she said.</p>

<p>Now she and her husband are wondering what to do and where to go.</p>

<p>"It is not easy to think you have everything and suddenly you have nothing," said Rodriguez.</p>

<p>"We dont know where to go. We have been in this country for nearly 20 years and have no family. It's her, me, and the dog," he said, pointing to their chihuahua Tito.</p>

<p><strong>Relief replaces fear</strong></p>

<p>Even though Milton was a powerful Category 3 hurricane on a five-level scale, in the end Florida was not hit nearly as hard as officials had feared.</p>

<p>In fact, most of the 11 fatalities from the storm happened on the east coast, away from where the storm made landfall, due to tornados that spun off from the storm.</p>

<p>In Sarasota, about 60 miles (100 kilometers) south of Clearwater and near where the hurricane made landfall, streets were gradually getting back to normal.</p>

<p>Emergency crews cleared many streets before dawn, but there were still downed trees in some places, along with broken glass and other damage.</p>

<p>Near the marina in Sarasota, dozens of people walked around taking pictures of the storm damage with their cell phones.</p>

<p>They looked at a speedboat that had rammed into a boat rental office because of Milton's powerful winds.</p>

<p>Many people expressed relief that the city was not as badly damaged as they had expected.</p>

<p>"I think it could have been a lot worse," said retiree Donna Pickup.</p>

<p>That feeling of relief is shared in Punta Gorda, 100 kilometers (60 miles) southeast of Sarasota.</p>

<p>In that town, hit hard by Hurricane Ian in 2022, the storm surge that rushed in Wednesday night flooded seaside areas and left several yachts stranded on the oceanfront promenade.</p>

<p>But here, too, the damage was not as bad as many had feared.</p>

<p>"Thank God," said David Cardoso, "a lot of houses are in pretty good tack".</p>

<p>He added: "It was supposed to hit us worse."</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At least 20 miners were killed and eight others were injured early Friday when unidentified armed men attacked their coal mines in Pakistan's restive Balochistan province.</p>

<p>The incident occurred in the Dukki area of the province, Dunya News reported.</p>

<p>The attack is the latest in a string of violence in Pakistan. It comes less ahead of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation's summit to be held in the national capital.</p>

<p>According to District Chairman Dukki Haji Khair Ullah Nasir, the attackers used hand grenades and rocket launchers in the attack. He said that there are ten coal mines located in the area.</p>

<p>Nasir said that the attackers also set ablaze mining machinery before fleeing the scene.</p>

<p>At least 20 miners were killed and eight others were wounded.</p>

<p>Police, paramilitary Frontier Corps (FC) and rescue teams rushed to the spot after the attack.</p>

<p>Police sources said that the death toll may rise as some injured minors were in critical condition.</p>

<p>SHO Dukki Hamanyan Khan said the armed men first gathered the miners in different groups and then sprayed bullets on them.</p>

<p>Heavy contingents of police and FC have cordoned off the area and launched a search operation to arrest the culprits.</p>

<p>Pakistan has witnessed a worrying surge in terrorist attacks in the ongoing year with fatalities in the first three quarters surpassing the numbers recorded in all of 2023.</p>

<p>As per the third Quarterly Report (Q3) issued by the Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS), the number of fatalities rose to at least 1,534 in the first three quarters of 2024 compared to 1,523 in 2023.</p>

<p>The banned Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) accuses China and Islamabad of exploitation of the resource-rich province, a charge rejected by the authorities. It has fought a long-running insurgency for a separate homeland.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel's army said Friday it had killed Palestinian militant group Islamic Jihad's top commander for the Nur Shams refugee camp in the occupied West Bank.</p>

<p>The military said Mohammad Abdullah was "eliminated" on Thursday after Israeli aircraft struck the camp in Tulkarem.</p>

<p>An additional "terrorist" was killed in the operation, which recovered M-16 rifles and vests, it added.</p>

<p>Abdullah was the successor of Muhammad Jabber, also known as Abu Shujaa, who was killed in an Israeli strike in late August. Islamic Jihad is an ally of Hamas, with both groups battling Israeli forces in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.</p>

<p>Violence has soared in the West Bank since Hamas launched its unprecedented attack on Israel in October last year.</p>

<p>Israeli troops or settlers have killed at least 705 Palestinians in the West Bank since, according to the Ramallah-based health ministry. Israeli officials say at least 24 Israelis, civilians or members of the security forces, have been killed in attacks carried out by Palestinian militants or in Israeli military operations over the same period in the West Bank.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Hurricane Milton: Florida grappled with flooding and power outages from a milder than expected storm that many had feared would be catastrophic.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At least 11 people died as Hurricane Milton sent tornadoes spinning across Florida, officials said Thursday as the state grappled with flooding, power outages and other issues from a milder than expected storm that many had feared would be catastrophic.</p>

<p>The hurricane blasted across the state late Wednesday before roaring into the Atlantic, leaving behind roads blocked by downed trees and power lines. It shredded the roof of a baseball stadium. Some three million homes and businesses were without power.</p>

<p>So far, though, it appeared that tornadoes, rather than floodwaters, have been responsible for the storm's deaths.</p>

<p>"It was pretty scary," said Susan Stepp, a 70-year-old resident of Fort Pierce, a city on Florida's east coast where four people in a senior living community died after a tornado spawned by Milton struck Wednesday.</p>

<p>"They did find some people just outside dead, in a tree," she told AFP. "I wish they would have evacuated."</p>

<p>The deaths are five in St. Lucie County, three in Volusia County two in the city of St. Petersburg and one in the city of Tampa, local authorities said. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas told reporters the deaths were caused by the tornadoes.</p>

<p>In Tampa, police found a woman in her early 70s trapped under a large tree branch and pronounced her dead, saying her death "is believed to be related to restoration efforts post Hurricane Milton."</p>

<p>In Polk County, a member of a road crew was struck and killed by a colleague's vehicle as he removed a downed tree.</p>

<p>Stepp's husband Bill said a tornado "picked up my 22-ton motor home and threw it across the yard."</p>

<p>"Scary and heartbreaking at the same time, to see much damage and all things you really love just gone, but it's only things and we're still here," the 72-year-old said.</p>

<p>The southeastern US state was able to avoid the level of catastrophic devastation that officials had feared.</p>

<p>"The storm was significant, but thankfully this was not the worst-case scenario," Florida Governor Ron DeSantis told a news conference.</p>

<p>Milton made landfall on the Florida Gulf Coast as a major Category 3 storm, with powerful winds smashing communities still reeling from Hurricane Helene which hit only two weeks ago, killing 237 people in Florida and other southeast states.</p>

<p>The National Weather Service issued 126 tornado warnings across the state Wednesday, the most ever issued for a single calendar day for the state in records dating back to 1986, wrote hurricane expert Michael Lowry.</p>

<p>In Sarasota Bay, Kristin Joyce, a 72-year-old interior designer who did not evacuate either, took photos of tree branches snapped by the wind.</p>

<p>"There is no question it needs to be a serious wake-up call for everyone in terms of climate change," she told AFP, surveying the damage.</p>

<p>Scientists say extreme rainfall and destructive storms are occurring with greater severity and frequency as temperatures rise due to climate change. As warmer ocean surfaces release more water vapor, they provide more energy for storms as they form.</p>

<p><strong>Biden fury at Trump</strong></p>

<p>President Joe Biden, who said he spoke with DeSantis Thursday, urged people to stay inside in the aftermath of the storm, with downed power lines and debris creating dangerous conditions.</p>

<p>In a video posted on social media, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said he and his wife Melania were praying for Florida residents affected by the storm and urged them to vote for him.</p>

<p>"Hopefully, on January 20th you're going to have somebody that's really going to help you and help you like never before," the former president said, referring to the presidential inauguration date.</p>

<p>Hurricane Helene struck Florida late last month, and the back-to-back storms have become election fodder as Trump spreads conspiracy theories claiming Biden and Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris are abandoning victims.</p>

<p>That prompted a furious response from Biden who on Wednesday called Trump "reckless, irresponsible."</p>

<p><strong>'Lucky'</strong></p>

<p>In Cocoa Beach, on Florida's east coast, one tornado swept in from the ocean, blowing out almost all the windows of a hair salon and tearing a chunk of roof off a bank.</p>

<p>Katherine and Larry Hingle said they were on their porch, watching water from a nearby river rise, when the tornado came through Wednesday evening.</p>

<p>"I said 'it sounds like a train's coming,'" Katherine, 53, told AFP while out to walk their dog and survey the damage.</p>

<p>In Sarasota, resident Carrie Elizabeth expressed the feelings of many -- that despite the violent night, Milton was not quite as bad as had been feared.</p>

<p>"I feel that we're very lucky," she said. "It'll take a long time to clean up, but it could have been much worse."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Three Israeli soldiers were killed on Wednesday in the northern Gaza Strip, even as the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) stepped up air and ground operations in Jabaliya.</p>

<p>The deceased soldiers were identified as&nbsp;37-year-old Major Nathaniel Hershkowitz, 32-year-old&nbsp;Major Zvi Mattiyo Marantz and 32-year-old&nbsp;Major Uri Moshe Bornstein. Their funeral will be held at the&nbsp;Mount Herzl Military Cemetery in Jerusalem on Friday.</p>

<p>The Israeli military amplified its offensive in Gaza's north, with troops encircling the key city of Jabaliya and some surrounding areas since Sunday with the goal to&nbsp;destroy the operational capabilities Hamas is trying to rebuild there.</p>

<p>Residents have been asked to evacuate, as the IDF aims to impose a&nbsp;total siege on Jabaliya until Hamas fighters surrender, according to news agency AFP. Further,&nbsp;Israeli army spokesman Avichay Adraee urged residents of the northern towns of Beit Hanoun, Jabaliya, Beit Lahia and other neighbourhoods to evacuate to southern Gaza.</p>

<p>The military said it has killed at least "20 terrorists".</p>

<p>Gaza's civil defence agency said the north has been pounded with air strikes in recent days, with dozens killed. Meanwhile,&nbsp;Hamas has said its fighters are targeting Israeli soldiers and tanks.</p>

<p>As the exchange of fire continues, Gaza's health ministry issued an appeal to the international community to bring in fuel to enable hospitals to continue providing services.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A terrifying video has surfaced showing the moment a tree fell on a moving car in Florida, just before Hurricane Milton made landfall. The driver survived the incident, which took place in DeLand as 120-mph winds from the hurricane pummeled Florida's west coast. As of Thursday, the fatalities from the hurricane rose to at least 15, according to CNN. The powerful tropical storm has left over 3 million residents without power and has caused widespread devastation across the state.</p>

<p>Urban Search and Rescue Teams, along with the Florida National Guard, have been working around the clock to assist those affected. According to Governor Ron DeSantis, nearly 1,000 people have been rescued so far. There are 23 rescue teams, comprising over 1,600 personnel, currently deployed across Florida, with additional support expected from other states.</p>

<p>In St Lucie County, one of the hardest-hit areas, residents recalled the terrifying moments when tornadoes ripped through the region ahead of the storm's landfall. Susan Carlos, a resident of Sunnier Palms Park, described the experience as "the most frightening thing I've ever lived through," noting that the damage from the tornadoes was unlike anything she had ever seen since moving to Florida in 1989.</p>

<p>"I've lived in Florida since 1989. Never have I experienced damage or the amount of tornadoes that came through this area. It was the most frightening thing I've ever lived through," Carlos told CNN.</p>

<p>As recovery efforts continue, the Biden administration is closely monitoring the situation, with officials focusing on coordinating national efforts to ensure a smooth recovery process for the storm-ravaged state.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Vowing to introduce a reciprocal tax if elected to power, former US president Donald Trump on Thursday alleged that India, among all major countries, imposes the highest tariffs on foreign products.</p>

<p>“Perhaps the most important element of my plan to make America extraordinarily wealthy again&nbsp;is reciprocity. It's a word that's very important in my plan because we generally don't charge tariffs. I started that process, it was so great, with the vans and the small trucks, etc. We really don't charge. China will charge us a 200 per cent tariff. Brazil is a big charger. The biggest charger of all is India,” Trump said in a major economic policy speech in Detroit.</p>

<p>“India is a very big charger. We have a great relationship with India. I did. And especially the leader, Modi. He's a great leader. Great man. Really is a great man. He's brought it together. He's done a great job. But they probably charge as much,” he said.</p>

<p>“I mean, I think they probably charge more than, in many ways, China. But they do it with a smile. They do it... Sort of a nicer charge. They said, thank you so much for purchasing from India. Harley Davidson came to the White House a long time ago during my third year or second year. I met with them. They were based in Wisconsin. I said, how's business? Good, good. What are the bad countries? Well, India is very tough. And they gave me some others. Why? Tariffs. I said, what are they? And they said like 150 per cent, some massive amount,” Trump told the members of the Detroit Economic Club.</p>

<p>“I said so do you sell many motorcycles because you think people want to buy a Harley. No, we sell very few in India, but they want us to go there. They said, if you go there and build your plant there, we're not going to charge you anything. I mean, you can do whatever you want. I said I don't like that. And I see they went, they built the plant, and now they do their business with India. They probably do it outside of India too. They built a very big plant in many countries, they do that. Then all of a sudden, you hear that they're leaving Milwaukee or they're leaving wherever they may be located,” he said.</p>

<p>Thursday's remarks by Trump come following his <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/donald-trump-praises-pm-modi-says-hes-the-nicest-6754565">praise for Prime Minister Narendra Modi</a> earlier this week.</p>

<p>Trump described Modi as “the nicest human being”, saying the Indian leader is “a friend of mine”.</p>

<p>“Modi, India. He's a friend of mine. He's great. Before him, they were replacing them every year. It's very unstable. He came over. He's a friend of mine. But on the outside, he looks like he's your father. He's the nicest, but he's a total killer,” he said.</p>

<p>Trump recalled Modi's visit to Houston in 2019 to attend the ‘Howdy Modi' event during his tenure and said: “It was beautiful. It's like 80,000 people going crazy. We were walking around.” The Republican candidate said he shared a “very good relationship” with Modi.</p>

<p>Recalling that there were a couple of occasions where somebody was threatening India, Trump said: "I told Modi, let me help as I am very good with those people. To which he aggressively responded, ‘I will do it. I will do it. And I would do anything necessary. We have defeated them for hundreds of years.' I said 'Whoa, what just happened there',” he added.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The winner of the 2024 Nobel Peace Prize will be announced on Friday in Oslo. Here is a look at how the award works:</p>

<p><strong>Who can win?</strong></p>

<p>According to the will of Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel, the inventor of dynamite, the prize should go to the person "who has done the most or best to advance fellowship among nations, the abolition or reduction of standing armies, and the establishment and promotion of peace congresses".</p>

<p>Thousands of people can propose names: members of governments and parliaments; current heads of state; university professors of history, social sciences, law and philosophy; and former Nobel Peace Prize laureates, among others.</p>

<p>This year there are 286 nominees, although the full list will be locked in a vault for 50 years.</p>

<p>Among the oddsmakers' favourites this year is late Russian dissident Alexei Navalny, who died in detention in February. But that is not possible as he cannot receive the prize posthumously.</p>

<p>Another favourite at the bookmakers is Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelenskiy, but he is also unlikely because he is a wartime leader.</p>

<p><strong>Who decides?</strong></p>

<p>The Norwegian Nobel Committee, which consists of five individuals appointed by the Norwegian parliament, is the arbiter. Members are often retired politicians, but not always. The current committee is led by the head of the Norwegian branch of PEN International, a group defending freedom of expression.</p>

<p>They are all put forward by Norwegian political parties and their appointments reflect the balance of power in Norway's parliament.</p>

<p><strong>How do they decide?</strong></p>

<p>Nominations close on Jan. 31. Members of the committee can make their own nominations no later than at the first meeting of the committee in February.</p>

<p>They discuss all the nominations, then establish a shortlist. Each nominee is then assessed and examined by a group of permanent advisers and other experts.</p>

<p>The committee meets roughly once a month to discuss the nominations. They usually make their decision at the final committee meeting, which tends to be at the beginning of October.</p>

<p>The committee seeks a consensus on its selection. If it cannot, the decision is reached by majority vote.</p>

<p>The last time a member quit in protest was in 1994, when Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat shared the prize with Israel's Shimon Peres and Yitzhak Rabin.</p>

<p><strong>Who is nominated?</strong></p>

<p>While the full list of nominations is kept secret, nominators are free to disclose them.</p>

<p>Among the names that have been disclosed this year are the United Nations refugee agency, UNHCR, Pope Francis and British naturalist David Attenborough.</p>

<p>Experts who follow the award say this year's prize may highlight the U.N. Palestinian refugee agency (UNRWA), the International Court of Justice and U.N. chief Antonio Guterres.</p>

<p><strong>What does the laureate get?</strong></p>

<p>A medal, a diploma, 11 million Swedish crowns ($1.1 million) and immediate global attention.</p>

<p>South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the 1984 winner, said becoming a Nobel laureate was a double-edged sword. "One day no one was listening. The next, I was an oracle," he is quoted as saying in his authorised biography.</p>

<p><strong>When are the announcement and the ceremony?</strong></p>

<p>The announcement will be made at 1100 CET (0900 GMT) on Friday, Oct. 11 at the Norwegian Nobel Institute in Oslo by the chair of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, Joergen Watne Frydnes.</p>

<p>The ceremony will take place at the Oslo City Hall on Dec. 10, the anniversary of Alfred Nobel's death.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former US President Barack Obama lashed out at "crazy" Donald Trump Thursday and urged voters to back Kamala Harris as he brought his star power to the 2024 election campaign trail for the first time.</p>

<p>As he hit the stump in the must-win state of Pennsylvania, Obama also chided Black male voters for hesitancy in supporting Democrat Harris because they "just aren't feeling the idea of having a woman as president."</p>

<p>Obama trained his fire on Trump during a pumped-up rally in Pittsburgh, comparing the Republican's long speeches to late Cuban communist leader Fidel Castro's and calling the billionaire out of touch with ordinary people.</p>

<p>America's first Black president admitted that "this election's going to be tight" as many voters were still struggling with high prices.</p>

<p>But he told the crowd that "what I cannot understand is why anybody would think that Donald Trump will shake things up", adding: "You think Donald Trump ever changed a diaper?'</p>

<p>The popular Democrat called Trump's schemes to sell bibles as "crazy" and used the same word to describe the 78-year-old former president's embrace of conspiracy theories.</p>

<p>As the crowd booed Trump, his successor in the White House, Obama added: "Don't boo -- vote."</p>

<p>"Kamala is as prepared for the job as any nominee for president has ever been," he added.</p>

<p><strong>'Got a problem'</strong></p>

<p>Vice president Harris's campaign said Obama's appearance, the first in a series in battleground states before the November 5 election, was designed to get people out to vote in crucial Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>Obama took aim at male voters who might be attracted by the Republican's appeals towards machismo.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry gentlemen, I've noticed this, especially with some men who seem to think Trump's behavior, the bullying and the putting people down, is a sign of strength," he said.</p>

<p>"And I am here to tell you that is not what real strength is."</p>

<p>Earlier, in a surprise stop before the rally at a campaign field office in Pittsburgh, Obama made an unusually direct appeal to Black men, whose support polls show Harris has struggled to mobilize.</p>

<p>Saying he had some "truths" that he wanted the Black community to hear, Obama said that "you're coming up with all kinds of reasons and excuses, I've got a problem with that."</p>

<p>"Because part of it makes me think -- and I'm speaking to men directly -- part of it makes me think that, well, you just aren't feeling the idea of having a woman as president.”</p>

<p>Harris was in battleground Nevada for a town hall hosted by the Spanish language network Univision Thursday before heading to Arizona for a rally to reach out to Latino voters.</p>

<p>When a woman asked Harris at the town hall to name three of Trump's virtues, she replied: "I think Donald Trump loves his family, and I think that's very important.... But I don't really know him, to be honest with you. I don't have much more to offer you."</p>

<p>The White House said Harris had also taken part in a virtual briefing on deadly Hurricane Milton hitting Florida, which has sparked a political storm between Republicans and Democrats.</p>

<p><strong>'Dumber than hell'</strong></p>

<p>Trump was in the hotly contested state of Michigan on Thursday, unveiling new details of his protectionist plans for the US auto industry, including sweeping tariffs on vehicles not made in America.</p>

<p>Trump also ramped up his personal attacks on Harris, branding her "dumber than hell," and assailed the auto industry capital Detroit itself as run down as he was speaking to the city's economic club.</p>

<p>"Our whole country will end up being like Detroit if she's your president," he said.</p>

<p>Harris meanwhile said she had accepted an offer for a CNN town hall on October 23 in Pennsylvania, after Trump turned down a final televised debate with her.</p>

<p>Democrats are hoping Obama could give Harris a boost in a race that has been locked with Trump for weeks, after her initial boost in the polls after she took over from President Joe Biden as the party's nominee in July.</p>

<p>Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama delivered rapturously received speeches backing Harris at the Democratic National Convention in August.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Two UN peacekeepers were injured in a strike by the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) on their headquarters in south Lebanon on Thursday. The attack led to wide international condemnation, especially by the European members of the 'Blue Helmet' mission.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="CetSht_cn">
<ol class="CetSht_ol">
	<li class="CetSht_li">Israel admitted its forces opened fire in the area, saying Hezbollah militants operated near UN posts. Italy, a major contributor of troops to the UN peacekeeping force, said the acts "could constitute war crimes" while the US said it was "deeply concerned."</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">The peacekeeping mission last week rejected Israel's demands to "relocate" from some of its positions in south Lebanon, where the IDF has been hitting what it claimed were Hezbollah targets.&nbsp;The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, or UNIFIL, has some 10,000 peacekeepers deployed in south Lebanon. It has been calling for a ceasefire since fighting escalated between the IDF and the militant group Hezbollah on September 23.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">The UN mission confirmed two peacekeepers were injured after an IDF Merkava tank fired a shell towards an observation tower at the UNIFIL headquarters in south Lebanon's Naqura, directly hitting it.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">The peacekeepers did not suffer serious injuries, "but they remain in hospital," it said. They are Indonesian nationals, a UNIFIL spokesperson said. Indonesia is also a major contributor of troops to the UNIFIL.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Indonesia's UN ambassador Hari Prabowo said the incident "clearly demonstrates how Israel positioned itself above international law, above impunity and above our shared values of peace."&nbsp;Israel claimed its military "opened fire in the area" of the UNIFIL base after telling UN forces to seek shelter.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Italy's Defence Minister Guido Crosetto said the attack and other incidents that the UNIFIL blames on Israel "could constitute war crimes", and asked for an explanation because "it was not a mistake". The Defence Minister described the shooting as intolerable, and filed protests with his Israeli counterpart and the country's ambassador to Italy.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">The White House said it was "deeply concerned". "We understand Israel is conducting targeted operations near the Blue Line to destroy Hezbollah infrastructure... it is critical that they not threaten UN peacekeepers' safety and security," the White House said.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Spain's foreign ministry said it "strongly condemns the Israeli firing that hit UNIFIL headquarters" which it called a "grave violation of international law".&nbsp;Irish Prime Minister Simon Harris, whose country has about 370 troops in the mission, said "any firing in the vicinity of UNIFIL troops or facilities is reckless and must stop".</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">UNIFIL headquarters and nearby positions "have been repeatedly hit," the mission said. On Wednesday, "IDF soldiers deliberately fired at and disabled" perimetre-monitoring cameras around a position, UNIFIL added.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">The head of UN peacekeeping Jean-Pierre Lacroix said peacekeepers were at "serious risk" and that by Sunday 300 Blue Helmets were temporarily relocated to larger bases "with the movement of another 200 planned." UNIFIL's footprint in the most affected positions would be slashed by 25 percent, he said. "The safety and security of peacekeepers is now increasingly in jeopardy," Mr Lacroix told the UN Security Council oln Thursday.</li>

<p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation's (FBI) Art Crime Team, the New York and New Orleans Field Offices, and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Louisiana Wednesday announced the repatriation of a Claude Monet pastel on paper, “Bord de Mer.”</p>

<p></p>

<p>The painting, created around 1865, was purchased by the Parlagi family at an Austrian art auction in 1936. A few years later, in 1940, during World War II, the pastel was seized by Gestapo, the Nazis' secret police force.</p>

<p>Eventually, the Monet was purchased at an auction by a Nazi art dealer and disappeared in 1941.</p>

<p>The Parlagi family has spent decades looking for the painting.</p>

<p>In 2023, the FBI got a lead when the artwork was listed for sale at a Houston art gallery. The team contacted Dr. and Mrs. Kevin Schlamp, the owners of the artwork, and explained its looted history. Schlamps voluntarily surrendered the piece.</p>

<p>Following this, with the help of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Louisiana, a consent judgment was secured in May 2024. The judgment awarded full ownership of the Monet to the Parlagi heirs.</p>

<p>“We are honored to have played a role in returning this stolen artwork to its rightful owners,” said James Dennehy. “While this Monet is undoubtedly valuable, its true worth lies in what it represents to the Parlagi family. It's a connection to their history, their loved ones, and a legacy that was nearly erased,” he added.</p>

<p>The FBI's work on this case is ongoing. Several other pieces of artwork were stolen from the Parlagi family in 1940 and the search is on.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[A pro-Palestinian hacktivist has claimed responsibility for a major cyberattack on the Internet Archive, exposing the personal data of 31 million users.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Internet Archive on Wednesday suffered a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/internet-archive-hacked-data-breach-impacts-31-million-users/" rel="nofollow,noindex">major data breach</a>, exposing the personal data of 31 million users. The attack compromised email addresses, screen names, and encrypted passwords, prompting cybersecurity experts to urge users to change their passwords immediately. The breach has raised concerns about data privacy and the security of the popular digital library, best known for its Wayback Machine.</p>

<p>The attack, which surfaced on October 9, revealed the details of millions of users after a JavaScript (JS) library on the Internet Archive's website was exploited. A pop-up message on the site alerted visitors, stating: "Have you ever felt like the Internet Archive runs on sticks and is constantly on the verge of suffering a catastrophic security breach? It just happened. See 31 million of you on HIBP!"&nbsp;</p>

<p>This message referred to the service <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/" rel="nofollow,noindex">Have I Been Pwned?</a> (HIBP), which helps users determine if their data has been compromised in a breach.</p>

<p>The database, which has been shared with cybersecurity experts, contained email addresses, screen names, passwords, and other internal data for 31 million unique email addresses. Troy Hunt, founder of Have I Been Pwned?, confirmed receiving a 6.4 GB database file from the attackers. Mr Hunt also noted that over half of the email addresses had already appeared in previous data breaches.</p>

<h3><strong>Internet Archive's Response</strong></h3>

<p>Brewster Kahle, the founder of the Internet Archive, acknowledged the breach and the ongoing Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks affecting the platform. In a post on X (formerly Twitter), Mr Kahle wrote: "What we know: DDOS attack fended off for now; defacement of our website via JS library; breach of usernames/email/salted-encrypted passwords. What we've done: Disabled the JS library, scrubbing systems, upgrading security. Will share more as we know it."</p>

— Brewster Kahle (@brewster_kahle) <a href="https://twitter.com/brewster_kahle/status/1844183111514603812?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 10, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p>Despite the initial efforts to fend off the attack, the Internet Archive's website, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://archive.org/" rel="nofollow,noindex">archive.org</a>, and its Wayback Machine have been intermittently inaccessible. The organisation has been scrubbing its systems and upgrading security as a response to the breach.</p>

<h3><strong>Behind The Breach</strong></h3>

<p>The account "SN_BlackMeta" claimed responsibility for the DDoS attacks. The group stated that their campaign lasted five hours and that they were launching "highly successful attacks."</p>

<p>SN_BlackMeta has been previously linked to attacks on Middle Eastern financial institutions and is associated with pro-Palestinian hacktivist movements.</p>

<p>In an X post, the group mentioned, "The Internet Archive has and is suffering from a devastating attack. We have been launching several highly successful attacks for five long hours and, to this moment, all their systems are completely down."</p>

<p>A community note attached to this post added context, stating: "This group claims they took down the Internet Archive because it 'belongs to the USA ... who support Israel,' which is not true. The Archive is not the US government; it is a nonprofit that includes many resources about Palestine, which we can't now access because of this attack."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>U.S. Vice President and Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris said on Thursday that de-escalation was needed in the Middle East, a region on edge for months amid Israel's wars in Gaza and Lebanon.</p>

<p><strong>WHY IT'S IMPORTANT</strong></p>

<p>A ceasefire remains elusive in Gaza and Lebanon and the region is bracing for an Israeli response to an Iranian missile attack last week carried out in retaliation for Israel's military action in Lebanon. No one in Israel was killed in Iran's attack, and Washington called it ineffective.</p>

<p>For Gaza, President Joe Biden put forward a three-phase ceasefire plan on May 31, which has run into obstacles for months over Israeli demands of keeping presence in a corridor on Gaza's border with Egypt and over differences in exchanges of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners.</p>

<p>In Lebanon, Washington and Paris put forward a 21-day ceasefire proposal in late September that Israel rejected.</p>

<p><strong>KEY QUOTES</strong></p>

<p>"We have got to reach a ceasefire," Harris told reporters as she departed Las Vegas, while commenting on the situations in Gaza and Lebanon. "We've got to de-escalate."</p>

<p>Washington's occasional condemnation of Israel over the war's civilian death toll has mostly been verbal with no substantive change in policy.</p>

<p><strong>CONTEXT</strong></p>

<p>The latest bloodshed in the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict was triggered on Oct. 7, 2023, when Palestinian Hamas militants attacked Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking about 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.</p>

<p>Israel's subsequent military assault on Gaza has killed almost 42,000 Palestinians, according to local health officials, and displaced nearly the entire population, while causing a hunger crisis and leading to genocide allegations at the World Court that Israel denies.</p>

<p>Israel's recent operations in Lebanon have killed hundreds, wounded thousands and displaced over a million. Israel says it is targeting Lebanese Iran-backed Hezbollah militants.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[According to Hindu mythology, the Jeshoreshwari Temple is one of the 51 Shakti Peeths scattered across India and neighboring countries. The name "Jeshoreshwari" means "Goddess of Jeshore."]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;A crown of goddess Kali has been stolen from the Jeshoreshwari temple in Satkhira's Shyamnagar. This crown was gifted by Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his visit to the temple in March, 2021, as reported by The Daily Star.</p>

<p>The theft occurred on Thursday between 2.00 pm and 2.30 pm, after Temple Priest Dilip Mukherjee left following the day's worship. The cleaning staff later found that the crown was missing from the deity's head, as reported by The Daily Star.</p>

<p>"We are reviewing the temple's CCTV footage to identify the thief," said Inspector Taizul Islam of Shyamnagar Police Station.</p>

<p>The stolen crown, made of silver and gold-plated, holds significant cultural and religious importance.</p>

<p>According to Hindu mythology, the Jeshoreshwari Temple is one of the 51 Shakti Peeths scattered across India and neighboring countries. The name "Jeshoreshwari" means "Goddess of Jeshore."</p>

<p>PM Modi visited the Jeshoreshwari Temple on March 27, 2021, during his trip to Bangladesh.</p>

<p>On that day, he placed the crown on the head of the deity as a symbolic gesture.</p>

<p>PM Modi also shared a video of his visit to the temple, which was his first visit to any country after the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>Jeshoreshwari Kali Temple a famous Hindu temple dedicated to the Goddess Kali, the temple is located in Ishwaripur--a village in Shyam Nagar, Upazila of Satkhira.</p>

<p>It is believed that the temple was built by a Brahman named Anari in the latter part of the 12th century.</p>

<p>He created a 100-door temple for the Jashoreshwari Peeth (shrine) and later it was renovated by Lakshman Sen in the 13th century and finally, Raja Pratapaditya rebuilt the temple in the 16th century.</p>

<p>According to Hindu mythology, of the 51 Peeths, the temple at Ishwaripur is the place where the palms and soles of the feet of Goddess Sati fell and the goddess resides there in the form of Devi Jashoreshwari and Lord Shiva appears as Chanda.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel pounded central Beirut with a deadly air strike on Thursday while its ground troops in Lebanon were accused of firing on the UN's peacekeeping headquarters, injuring two of them.</p>

<p>The air raid on Beirut, where an AFP journalist heard several loud explosions, was the third such attack on the centre of the Lebanese capital since Israel escalated its campaign last month.</p>

<p>"The Israeli enemy's attacks on the capital Beirut this evening resulted in an updated toll of 22 people killed and 117 others injured," Lebanon's health ministry said in a statement.</p>

<p>A Lebanese security source, without giving further details, said a "Hezbollah figure" was targeted, after a series of killings of top officials in the Iran-backed movement.</p>

<p>AFP live TV footage showed two plumes of smoke billowing in between densely-packed buildings, while there was no immediate comment from Israeli authorities about the nature of the target.</p>

<p>Most Israeli strikes have targeted the south Beirut area, not the centre.</p>

<p>The attack came on the same day as the UN's peacekeeping force in Lebanon accused Israeli soldiers of "repeatedly" firing on its positions, including with a tank, leaving two Indonesian Blue Helmets with injuries.</p>

<p>Italian Defence Minister Guido Crosetto, whose country is a major contributor to the force, condemned the "hostile acts" which he said "could constitute war crimes", while Spain called it a "grave violation of international law".</p>

<p>Washington said that while Israel targets Hezbollah facilities "it is critical that they not threaten UN peacekeepers' safety and security."</p>

<p>The Israeli military said it had been operating against Hezbollah militants near UNIFIL headquarters and had "instructed the UN forces in the area to remain in protected spaces."</p>

<p>Israel has been pounding Hezbollah in Lebanon since September 23 in an escalated campaign that has killed more than 1,200 people and displaced more than a million others, according to an AFP tally of health ministry figures.</p>

<p>Its ground forces crossed into Lebanon on September 30 with the aim of stopping Hezbollah's cross-border fire in support of Palestinian militant group Hamas, which attacked Israel on October 7.</p>

<p>Hezbollah missile and artillery fire has forced tens of thousands of Israelis to flee their homes near the border over the past year, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has promised to fight until they can return.</p>

<h2><strong>HUMANITARIAN LAW</strong></h2>

<p>The Lebanon operation is a second front for Israel's stretched armed forces which are continuing their campaign against Hamas Palestinian militants in Gaza.</p>

<p>Israeli forces launched a major operation in the north of the territory at the weekend around the Jabalia refugee camp, where about 400,000 people are trapped, according to Philippe Lazzarini, head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA.</p>

<p>Speaking to reporters on Wednesday about the humanitarian situation, US State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said that Washington was "incredibly concerned" as Israel tightens its siege.</p>

<p>"We have been making clear to the government of Israel that they have an obligation under international humanitarian law to allow food and water and other needed humanitarian assistance to make it into all parts of Gaza," he said.</p>

<p>An Israeli strike on a school building in Deir el-Balah in central Gaza on Thursday left at least 28 people dead and 54 injured, according to the Palestine Red Crescent.</p>

<p>It is the latest of numerous such incidents.</p>

<p>The Israeli army said in a statement the strike targeted Palestinian combatants operating from a command-and-control centre "embedded inside a compound that previously served as the (Rafida) School".</p>

<p>The Israeli military accuses Hamas of hiding in school buildings where thousands of Gazans have sought shelter -- a charge denied by the militant group.</p>

<p>UN investigators on Thursday also accused Israel of deliberately targeting health facilities and killing and torturing medical personnel in Gaza.</p>

<p>Israel is "committing war crimes and the crime against humanity of extermination with relentless and deliberate attacks on medical personnel and facilities", the UN Independent International Commission of Inquiry said in a statement.</p>

<h3><strong>DEADLY, PRECISE</strong></h3>

<p>Ahead of Yom Kippur this Friday and Saturday, the holiest day in the Jewish calendar, Israelis are also braced for the country's reaction to a missile attack last week from Iran, which backs both Hamas and Hezbollah.</p>

<p>Iran fired about 200 missiles in what it said was retaliation for the assassination of two of its closest allies, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, along with an Iranian general.</p>

<p>Israel's Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said Wednesday that "our attack on Iran will be deadly, precise and surprising. They will not understand what happened and how it happened."</p>

<p>Biden has cautioned Israel against attempting to target Iran's nuclear facilities and opposes striking oil installations.</p>

<p>"I don't think we are currently in a situation that the two countries are seeking an all-out direct war," Hamid, a 29-year-old university student in Tehran, told AFP on Thursday.</p>

<p>"It will have severe economic and military consequences" on both countries, he added.</p>

<p>The Gaza war began on October 7 last year, when Hamas militants stormed across the border and carried out the worst attack in Israeli history.</p>

<p>The militants took 251 people hostage in an attack that resulted in the deaths of 1,206 people, most of them civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.</p>

<p>According to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry, 42,065 people have been killed in Gaza since the start of the war, a majority civilians, figures the UN has described as reliable.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lebanon's health ministry said Thursday at least 11 people had been killed in Israeli strikes on Beirut -- the third such attack on the capital since Israel escalated its air campaign last month.</p>

<p>Israel has repeatedly pounded southern Beirut suburbs, the bastion of Lebanon's Hezbollah movement, for more than two weeks but strikes have rarely targeted the city centre.</p>

<p>"The Israeli enemy's attacks on the capital Beirut this evening killed, according to a preliminary toll, 11 people and injured 48 others," the ministry said in a statement.</p>

<p>Lebanon's National News Agency (NNA) said the strikes hit the densely populated neighbourhoods of Nweiri and Basta.</p>

<p>"The first strike in Beirut targeted the third floor of an eight-storey building" in the Nweiri area, and a second strike hit "a four-storey building... in al-Basta al-Fouqa, which completely collapsed," the NNA.</p>

<p>An AFP photographer at the site of the strike in the Basta area said two old buildings had collapsed, while the windows of surrounding homes had been blown out with the force of the explosion.</p>

<p>Civil defence members and local residents were attempting to pull survivors out of the mountain of rubble, with some of them carried away on stretchers.</p>

<p>Firefighters were working to put out a blaze in a "residential building" hit in the Nweiri area, with residents being evacuated from the upper floors using a ladder, NNA reported.</p>

<p>Immediately after the raids, AFP live footage showed two plumes of smoke billowing in between densely-packed buildings.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, Israel carried out a deadly air raid in Beirut, hitting an emergency services rescue facility run by Hezbollah, killing seven workers, the service said.</p>

<p>On September 30, an Israeli drone strike on a building in Beirut's busy Cola district killed three members of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), the leftist armed group said.</p>

<p>Lebanon's Iran-backed Hezbollah movement and its foe Israel have been exchanging near-daily cross-border fire for nearly a year in fallout from the Gaza war.</p>

<p>But since September 23, Israel has escalated its air strikes on targets in Lebanon, killing more than 1,200 people and forced more than one million to flee their homes, according to official figures.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

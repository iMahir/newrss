       <description><![CDATA[Sancho was found guilty of premeditated murder, concealing a corpse, and destroying property.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The son of a well-known Spanish actor has been sentenced to life imprisonment for killing and dismembering a man on the Thai island of Koh Phangan last year. Daniel Sancho Bronchalo, the son of television star Rodolfo Sancho Aguirre, claimed he acted in self-defence when he killed Colombian plastic surgeon Edwin Arrieta Arteaga. He pleaded guilty to the murder in August 2023, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyxry3k9rgo" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>BBC </em></a>reported.</p>

<p>Sancho, now 30, told the Spanish news agency EFE at the time that he had been a "hostage" to Arrieta, whom he described as obsessed with him. The case has attracted significant attention in Spain, with many journalists travelling to Thailand to cover the trial.</p>

<p>Sancho was found guilty of premeditated murder, concealing a corpse, and destroying property.</p>

<p>A court on the nearby island of Koh Samui, where the trial took place, initially sentenced him to death for murder. However, this was reduced to life imprisonment due to his cooperation during the trial.</p>

<p>Sancho, a chef with his own YouTube channel, was also ordered to pay 4 million baht ($118,000) to compensate Arrieta's family. Bussakorn Kaewleeled, the victim's family lawyer, expressed satisfaction with the verdict.</p>

<p>"The plaintiff is satisfied with the sentence because he (Sancho) will be put in prison for life and they (the plaintiff) receive some financial compensation," Bussakorn told reporters outside the Koh Samui court, as reported by AFP news agency.</p>

<p>Police found parts of Arrieta's body at a landfill in Koh Phangan in early August last year.</p>

<p>Around that time, Sancho reported to the police that Arrieta, then 44, was missing. After further questioning, Sancho confessed to the murder.</p>

<p>Thai media reported that investigations had shown Sancho had purchased a knife, rubber gloves, and a bottle of cleaning agent, leading police to conclude the murder was premeditated.</p>

<p>Sancho later led police to seven locations around the island where he had disposed of Arrieta's dismembered body in plastic bags.</p>

<p>Reports stated that Sancho and Arrieta had agreed to meet after becoming acquainted online.</p>

<p>The defence argued that Sancho acted in self-defence when Arrieta tried to force him into a sexual encounter. In a statement published by the Spanish newspaper El Mundo, Sancho said the plastic surgeon "tried to rape [him]."</p>

<p>Sancho comes from a family of actors; his mother is actress Silvia Bronchalo, and his grandfather was the late actor Felix Angel Sancho Gracia.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Hong Kong pro-democracy news outlet Stand News and its two former chief editors were found guilty of sedition on Thursday, the first conviction of its kind since the city came under Chinese rule in 1997.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hong Kong pro-democracy news outlet Stand News and its two former chief editors were found guilty of sedition on Thursday, the first conviction of its kind since the city came under Chinese rule in 1997.</p>

<p>The verdict is part of a crackdown on free speech in the former British colony that has seen critics of China jailed or forced into exile, following huge pro-democracy protests in 2019.</p>

<p>Editors Chung Pui-kuen, 54, and Patrick Lam, 36, are the first journalists to be convicted of sedition since Britain handed Hong Kong over to China in 1997, and the ruling drew resounding international condemnation.</p>

<p>Chung and Lam were in charge of Stand News, a Chinese-language website that gained a massive following during the protests in 2019, before it was raided and shut down in December 2021.</p>

<p>On Thursday, district court judge Kwok Wai-kin said the pair were guilty of "conspiracy to publish and reproduce seditious publications". The parent company of Stand News, Best Pencil Limited, was also found guilty.</p>

<p>"The line (Stand News) took was to support and promote Hong Kong local autonomy," according to a written judgement by Kwok.</p>

<p>"It even became a tool to smear and vilify the Central Authorities (Beijing) and the (Hong Kong) SAR Government."</p>

<p>Kwok also pointed to 11 articles published by Stand News that "caused potential detrimental consequences to national security" and had the intention of "seriously undermining" authorities in Beijing and Hong Kong.</p>

<p>Lam was absent from court on Thursday due to illness.</p>

<p>The judge granted the duo bail before their sentencing on September 26.</p>

<h3><strong>Colonial-era law</strong></h3>

<p>Chung and Lam were charged under a colonial-era law, which punishes sedition with a maximum jail term of two years.</p>

<p>A recent security law enacted in March raised the jail term for sedition to seven years.</p>

<p>In response to the verdict, the European Union called on Hong Kong to "stop prosecuting journalists".</p>

<p>"The ruling risks inhibiting the pluralistic exchange of ideas and the free flow of information, both cornerstones of the economic success of Hong Kong," a EU spokesperson said.</p>

<p>Speaking outside court, police chief superintendent Steve Li said the verdict "clearly illustrated the necessity and lawfulness" of the enforcement actions in 2021 against Stand News.</p>

<p>Asked if the verdict would further affect press freedom, Li said it would "actually help".</p>

<p>"It would let everyone know what kind of problems could risk breaching the law," he said.</p>

<h3><strong>Not seditious</strong></h3>

<p>But Beh Lih Yi from the Committee to Protect Journalists said the ruling showed that Hong Kong was "descending further into authoritarianism".</p>

<p>"Journalism is not seditious," she said.</p>

<p>Sarah Brooks, Amnesty International's China Director, called the verdict "one more nail in the coffin for press freedom in Hong Kong".</p>

<p>Hong Kong has seen its standing in global press freedom rankings plummet in recent years.</p>

<p>Chung had testified that the outlet was a platform for free speech and defended his decisions to publish articles critical of the government.</p>

<p>But prosecutors accused them of bringing "hatred or contempt" to the Chinese and Hong Kong governments.</p>

<p>More than 100 people, including supporters and media professionals, queued up for spots in the public gallery on Thursday morning.</p>

<p>The verdict was also attended by representatives from various consulates -- including the United States, Britain, France, European Union, and Australia.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Film legend Errol Morris said the separation of thousands of migrant children from their parents by Donald Trump's US administration was "inhumane and cruel" as his new documentary about the policy premiered at the Venice Film Festival Thursday.</p>

<p>"Do we need borders? Do we need immigration law? We do," the Oscar-winning US director told AFP ahead of the screening of his film "Separated". "But the idea is laws should be fair and humane."</p>

<p>"And this particular policy struck me, still strikes me, as inhumane, as cruel as mean."</p>

<p>In 2017, during Donald Trump's first year as US president, his administration raised the idea of separating children from their parents as a way to deter illegal immigration -- a key plank of his campaign.</p>

<p>Officially launched in April 2018, the "zero-tolerance" policy allowed criminal proceedings to be brought against anyone who crossed the US-Mexico border illegally, resulting in parents being immediately taken into custody without their children.</p>

<p>According to the documentary, which cited official government figures, at least 4,227 children were taken from their parents -- and more than 1,000 are still separated.</p>

<p>"What horrifies me is that they didn't keep records. They separated families in such a way that it might be impossible ever to reunite them," said Morris, 76.</p>

<p>The veteran director won an Oscar in 2004 for "The Fog of War", an astonishingly frank account of the Vietnam War by one of its architects, former US Secretary of defence Robert McNamara.</p>

<h3><strong>Divisive</strong></h3>

<p>Morris's new film -- being shown out of competition in Venice -- is based on a book by US journalist Jacob Soboroff, who helped expose the desperate plight of the children.</p>

<p>"He had called me and asked me if I knew anybody who might be willing to turn his book into a movie... I volunteered myself," Morris said.</p>

<p>The documentary is largely based on statements by Jonathan White, who was deputy director of the US Office for Refugee Resettlement (ORR) at the time and who opposed the policy applied by his superior, Scott Lloyd, who is also interviewed.</p>

<p>Lawsuits and a public outcry, even among Trump's own Republican Party, forced the administration by mid-2018 to halt the separations.</p>

<p>In practice, however, the Trump administration continued to separate families under another regulation which allowed undocumented parents to be arrested and deported if they had committed a serious crime.</p>

<p>Immigration remains a hugely divisive issue for many Americans ahead of November's presidential election, in which Trump is running against Vice President Kamala Harris.</p>

<p>A recent official US report found the government may have lost track of up to 32,000 unaccompanied migrant children in the past four years.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A sudden sinkhole appeared on a busy road in western Seoul's Seodaemun district on Thursday, swallowing an SUV, with two passengers inside. The vehicle, carrying a woman in her 70s and a man in his 80s, rolled over and crashed into the sinkhole, leaving both injured. The couple's white Tivoli "rolled over sideways, crashing into the sinkhole", the <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://m.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20240829050448" rel="nofollow, noindex">Korea Herald</a></em>&nbsp;reported. Both sustained serious injuries and were promptly transported to a hospital. The unexpected sinkhole caused chaos on the roads, leading to severe traffic congestion.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dramatic photos from the scene revealed a white sport utility vehicle almost entirely swallowed by a massive sinkhole that unexpectedly opened on the road.&nbsp;No one else was hurt in the incident, which occurred at around 11:20 am (0220 GMT), according to Seoul's Seodaemun district fire station,&nbsp;<em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://news.sky.com/story/seoul-elderly-couple-injured-after-their-car-falls-into-sinkhole-13205224" rel="nofollow, noindex">Sky News</a></em> reported.</p>

<p>Authorities later cordoned off the area, restricting access as they launched an investigation into the cause of the sinkhole.</p>

<p>Sinkholes are a recurring issue in South Korea, with at least 879 reported cases between 2019 and June 2023, according to the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport. The ministry attributed nearly half of these incidents to damaged sewer pipes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Recently, a 48-year-old <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/indians-abroad/andhra-woman-swept-away-in-malaysia-sewage-drain-after-footpath-collapses-6414411">Indian tourist fell into a sinkhole</a> in Kuala Lumpur.&nbsp;The woman, identified as Vijayalakshmi from Chittoor district's &nbsp;Animiganipalle village, was reportedly walking along a footpath when the ground collapsed. While her husband and son managed to escape the collapse, she was swept into the underground sewer.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Rescue operations were launched immediately by the civic authorities in Kuala Lumpur and are ongoing.&nbsp;Vijayalakshmi was known for frequently travelling to Malaysia and Singapore as part of her business.&nbsp;In response to the incident, Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu has directed officials from the Andhra Pradesh Non-Resident Telugu (APNRT) Society to ensure that the search operations are conducted effectively.&nbsp;</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Coastal cities are not doing enough to adapt to climate change, taking too long and implementing insufficient measures, according to a major study published this week.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Coastal cities are not doing enough to adapt to climate change, taking too long and implementing insufficient measures, according to a major study published this week.</p>

<p>While flood barriers and pumping systems are a step in the right direction, "across all regions and income groups, scientifically reported adaptation in coastal cities remains at rather low depth, scope and speed," said the study published in Nature Cities, which looked at 199 cities worldwide.</p>

<p>Given the high exposure and vulnerability of many <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-east-coast-cities-are-literally-sinking-millions-at-risk-study-shows-4853339" target="_blank">coastal cities</a>, "this finding is alarming as adaptation to future climate change will require many cities to go beyond business as usual risk management," it said.</p>

<p>Short- and mid-term solutions, as many cities are implementing, could even have an adverse effect, the study warned, leading to a "lock-in and maladaptive path dependency in the long-term."</p>

<p>Instead, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/new-study-warns-climate-change-will-make-you-poorer-5468268" target="_blank">adaptation</a> must aim at "transformation" of cities -- a change both of infrastructure and at the institutional level.</p>

<p>Positive models cited in the report include Singapore, Hong Kong and several Swedish cities.</p>

<p>But in the majority, the study found that coastal cities focus primarily on combating sea level rise, various types of flooding, and to a lesser extent the risks posed by erosion and storms.</p>

<p>And for scientists such a scope is too narrow -- cities need to address other problems linked to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/humanity-is-killing-the-great-barrier-reef-warns-report-6413023" target="_blank">climate change</a>, such as heatwaves.</p>

<h3><strong>Institutions and households</strong></h3>

<p>By comparing data from 199 cities, listed in 683 scientific articles, the researchers found that the actors driving adaptation changed according to the country and income category.</p>

<p>The richest coastal areas take a technological approach to dealing with climate change and the major players are institutions.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, lower-income cities located mainly in Africa, Asia, and South and Central <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/how-climate-change-has-forced-us-to-change-policy-5651674" target="_blank">America</a>, have no other choice but to rely on a "behavioural and cultural" effort for populations to adapt.</p>

<p>In lower-income coastal cities, there is a lack of institutional and/or technological support, making it "more likely individuals/households are reported as prime adaptation actors."</p>

<p>The poorest economies remain under-represented in the scientific literature, which complicates their adaptation.</p>

<p>"A considerable gap in research that needs to be addressed urgently," the study warned.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Kremlin warned France on Thursday not to turn a criminal case against Telegram founder Pavel Durov into "political persecution."</p>

<p>Russia, which has led an unprecedented crackdown on political opponents during its Ukraine offensive, has painted Durov's surprise arrest in Paris earlier this week as politically motivated.</p>

<p>France has charged Russian-born Durov -- who also has French citizenship -- on several counts of failing to curb extremist and illegal content on the popular social media platform.</p>

<p>"The main thing is for what is happening in France not to run into political persecution," Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.</p>

<p>"Of course we consider him a Russian citizen and as much as possible we will be ready to provide assistance," he added.</p>

<p>"We will be watching what happens next."</p>

<p>Durov was granted conditional release against a bail of five million euros on the condition he must report to a police station twice a week as well as remain in France, French prosecutors said.</p>

<p>Telegram is one of Russia's most popular messaging apps.</p>

<p>Russian officials have rushed to defend Durov since he was arrested last weekend at a Paris airport.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Trump's latest move follows his promotion of an "official" cryptocurrency project, as the crypto industry faces increased regulatory scrutiny.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former US President and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has unveiled the fourth series of his digital trading cards worth $99 each. The digital cards are named "Series 4: The America First Collection" non-fungible tokens (or NFTs).</p>

<p>Among the new additions to these cards are some interesting ones highlighting his influence and political career. <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://collecttrumpcards.com">These cards feature</a> Donald Trump posing as a "sneakerhead," wearing his own line of golden shoes, wearing an Iron Man-style suit with the title "SuperTrump," and several with the label "crypto president."</p>

<p>In June Trump gave himself the tag of crypto president while speaking at a tech fundraiser, when he presented himself as a champion for cryptocurrency and slammed Democrats' attempts to regulate the sector. Trump touted crypto as important and stressed that he was very supportive of the sector.</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/maryroeloffs/2024/08/27/trump-selling-more-nft-trading-cards-as-he-courts-crypto-voters/"><em>Forbes,</em></a> the release includes pricy packages that promise physical gifts to buyers: Customers who hit a minimum spend could get autographed shoes from Trump's sneaker line, a piece of his suit from his debate with President Joe Biden and dinner with the former president, and up to 25 people who spend $24,750 (using only crypto) are promised tickets to a Trump gala in Florida next month and cocktails with the former president.</p>

<p>The launch of the new NFT cards comes less than a week after Trump promoted an "official" cryptocurrency project using his name on Truth Social and linked to a group in the Telegram messaging app run by his sons Eric and Don Jr called "The DeFiant Ones" (a nod to DeFi, short for decentralized finance).</p>

<p>The crypto industry is increasingly trying to influence US politicians as it faces heightened scrutiny from regulators, especially since bankruptcies at major crypto firms in 2022 spooked investors, exposed fraud and misconduct, and left millions of investors out of pocket.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Democrat Kamala Harris leads Republican Donald Trump 45% to 41% in a Reuters/Ipsos poll published on Thursday that showed the vice president sparking new enthusiasm among voters and shaking up the race ahead of the Nov. 5 election.</p>

<p>The 4 percentage point advantage among registered voters was wider than a 1 point lead Harris held over the former president in a late July Reuters/Ipsos poll. The new poll, which was conducted in the eight days ended Wednesday and had a 2 percentage point margin of error, showed Harris picking up support among women and Hispanics.</p>

<p>Harris led Trump by 49% to 36% - or 13 percentage points - among both women voters and Hispanic voters. Across four Reuters/Ipsos polls conducted in July, Harris had a 9 point lead among women and a 6 point lead among Hispanics.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Trump led among white voters and men, both by similar margins as in July, though his lead among voters without a college degree narrowed to 7 points in the latest survey, down from 14 points in July.</p>

<p>The findings illustrate how the U.S. presidential race has been shaken up over the summer. President Joe Biden, 81, folded his flailing campaign on July 21 after a disastrous debate performance against Trump sparked widespread calls from his fellow Democrats to abandon his re-election bid.</p>

<p>Since then, Harris has gained ground against Trump in national polls and those in critical swing states. While national surveys including Reuters/Ipsos' give important signals on the views of the electorate, the state-by-state results of the Electoral College determine the winner, with a handful of battleground states likely to be decisive.</p>

<p>In the seven states where the 2020 election was closest - Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Arizona, North Carolina, Michigan and Nevada - Trump had a 45% to 43% lead over Harris among registered voters in the poll.</p>

<p>"It's obvious that running against Harris is more challenging for Trump given the shift in these numbers, but it's certainly not insurmountable," said Matt Wolking, a Republican campaign strategist who worked on Trump's 2020 campaign. He said Trump needs to stay as focused as possible in his campaign "so he's not scaring" away voters who were leaning his way because they didn't like Biden.</p>

<p>Since formally accepting the Democratic nomination last week, Harris has embarked on a tour of battleground states including Georgia, where Biden had been hemorrhaging support before he ended his campaign.</p>

<h3><strong>Rising Enthusiasm</strong></h3>

<p>Some 73% of Democratic registered voters in the poll said they were more excited about voting in November after Harris entered the race. And while a March Reuters/Ipsos poll found that 61% respondents who intended to vote for Biden were doing so mainly to stop Trump, 52% of Harris voters in the August poll were voting to support her as a candidate rather than primarily to oppose Trump.</p>

<p>"We see it in this poll that people are more motivated about the future than the past," said Aimee Allison, founder of She the People, a liberal group that aims to grow the numbers of women of color in elected office. "They see Kamala Harris as the future, and Republicans see this election as just about Trump. Voters are more likely to be engaged when given the option of 'more than' beating Trump."</p>

<p>But Trump voters also voiced enthusiasm about their candidate, with 64% saying their choice was more motivated by backing Trump than opposing Harris.</p>

<p>Voters picked Trump as having a better approach to managing the U.S. economy, 45% to 36%, a wider margin than Trump had in another Reuters/Ipsos poll this week.</p>

<p>Harris, by contrast, had a 47% to 31% advantage on abortion policy. The issue is salient for Democrats after the conservative U.S. Supreme Court in 2022 struck down women's national right to abortion. Trump nominated three conservative justices to the court during his 2017-2021 presidency. Some 41% of voters in the poll - and 70% of Democrats - said they were worried the next president might sign a national ban on abortions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The latest poll's survey period partially overlapped with the Aug. 19-22 Democratic National Convention in Chicago where Harris formally accepted her party's nomination, and it remains to be seen whether the same level of enthusiasm for Harris will continue.</p>

<p>The poll was conducted nationally and gathered responses from 4,253 U.S. adults, including 3,562 registered voters.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who suspended his campaign on Aug. 23 while the poll was still being conducted, had the support of 6% of voters in the survey.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>South Korea's Constitutional Court ruled Thursday that much of the country's climate goals were unconstitutional, handing a landmark victory to young environmental activists, who wept for joy on the court steps.</p>

<p>The first such case in Asia, brought by children and teenagers who named an embryo as a lead complainant, claimed that South Korea's legally binding climate commitments were insufficient and unmet, violating their constitutionally guaranteed human rights.</p>

<p>"Just now, the Constitutional Court ruled that it is unconstitutional that there is no government goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from 2031 to 2050," said Yoon Hyeon-jeong, one of the young activists involved.</p>

<p>"It was ruled that our right to live a safe life from the climate crisis should be guaranteed," she added, barely managing to finish her sentence as she choked up with tears.</p>

<p>The court ruled that the government's limited climate targets violate the constitution as they do "not sufficiently protect the basic rights of the people," the legal representatives of the complainants said after the hearing.</p>

<p>The case -- known as "Woodpecker et al. v. South Korea" after the in-utero nickname of an embryo, now toddler, involved -- included four petitions by children.</p>

<p>In 2021, South Korea made a legally binding commitment to reduce carbon emissions by 290 million tons by 2030 -- and to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.</p>

<p>To meet this goal, the country needs to reduce emissions by 5.4 percent every year from 2023 -- a target they have so far failed to meet.</p>

<p>As a result of the ruling, Seoul will now have to revise its climate goals, said Youn Se-jong, a lawyer for the complainants.</p>

<p>"The National Assembly and the government of the Republic of Korea will have to revise regulations related to the Framework Act on Carbon Neutrality and present greenhouse gas reduction goals considering the rights of future generations," Youn said.</p>

<p>"With today's ruling, we have confirmed that climate change is a matter of our fundamental rights and that everyone has the right to be safe from it," he said.</p>

<p>"Ordinary people like us have come this far. We have led the constitutional petition to protect our rights without relying on authority and power. It took us five years," said youth climate activist Kim Seo-gyeong, 21.</p>

<p>Kim was part of the group that filed the first of the cases in 2020, and said the ruling was a validation for young people who found themselves "living in the climate crisis."</p>

<h3><strong>'Wish came true'</strong></h3>

<p>Seoul's Ministry of Environment said in a statement that it respected the court's decision.</p>

<p>The ministry said it plans "to faithfully implement follow-up measures".</p>

<p>The complainants had argued that unless Seoul moved more quickly on climate goals, future generations would not only have to live in a degraded environment, but also have to bear the burden of undertaking massive greenhouse gas reductions.</p>

<p>This, the case claims, would mean that the state has violated its duty to protect their fundamental rights.</p>

<p>Similar climate cases globally have found success.</p>

<p>A youth-led effort recently succeeded in the US state of Montana, while another is being heard at the European Higher Court.</p>

<p>In Germany, in 2021 climate targets were ruled insufficient and unconstitutional, and lawyer Lee Chi-sun said the two cases were very similar.</p>

<p>"Just as Germany has further strengthened its reduction targets for 2040 and revised the goal for 2045 after their ruling, we expect Seoul's 2030 reduction targets will be strengthened" and expanded, he said.</p>

<p>Other cases have not fared so well globally -- a child-led suit in California over alleged government failures to curb pollution was thrown out in May.</p>

<p>The Thursday ruling is the first in Asia to question a country's national greenhouse gas reduction targets "and the court's ruling can set an important precedent for other courts in Asia to rule on similar cases," said Lin Yan-Ting, a climate activist who is a complainant for a similar case in Taiwan, filed in January.</p>

<p>Outside the Seoul court 12-year-old complainant, Han Jeah -- who started the case aged 10 -- said the verdict was "like a wish came true."</p>

<p>"We have the right to live safely and happily even in the climate crisis. This right should be protected under any circumstances and cannot be infringed upon by anyone," Han Jeah said.</p>

<p>"So I wanted to show people through this lawsuit how much we (young people) know and how deeply we worry about climate change."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pakistan today formally announced that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been invited to the upcoming Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) meeting being held in Islamabad in mid-October.</p>

<p>Pakistan Foreign Office spokesperson Mumtaz Zahra Baloch, at her weekly press briefing, said Islamabad had sent invitations to the heads of countries to participate in the meeting, Pakistani media reported.</p>

<p>"An invitation has also been sent to the Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi," she said, adding that some countries had already confirmed their participation in the meeting.</p>

<p>"It will be informed in due course which country has confirmed," Ms Baloch added.</p>

<p>Pakistan is set to host the SCO heads of government meeting on October 15-16. The event will be preceded by a ministerial meeting and several rounds of senior officials' meetings focused on financial, economic, socio-cultural, and humanitarian cooperation among the SCO member states.</p>

<p>Analysts see the invitation as a "protocol" as PM Modi is unlikely to accept the invitation as relations between the two neighbouring countries have been tense.</p>

<p>It is possible that PM Modi may depute a ministerial delegation to represent India as the SCO meeting does not require heads of state to participate. In the past as well, SCO CHG meetings have seen India represented by ministers and the same pattern is this time as well.</p>

<p>PM Modi had not attended the SCO's 24th annual summit of heads of state held in Kazakhstan on July 3-4 this year and External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar had represented India in Astana.</p>

<p>Pakistani analysts say they do not expect that PM Modi will come to Pakistan for the meeting.</p>

<p>"Extending invitations to PM Modi and all other member states is a compulsive protocol any host country follows. Pakistan has done the same. I do not see this as a political stunt. However, I do not see PM Modi landing in Islamabad," political analyst Kamran Yousaf said.</p>

<p>Last year, Pakistan's then-Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari visited India for the SCO Foreign Ministers' meeting.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Israeli military said on Thursday its troops killed five Palestinian fighters who were hiding inside a mosque in the West Bank city of Tulkarm, in one of the largest assaults on the occupied territory for months.</p>

<p>The operation, which a Reuters witness said has yet to conclude, began in the early hours of Wednesday with hundreds of Israeli troops backed by helicopters, drones and armoured personnel carriers raiding the flashpoint cities of Tulkarm, Jenin and areas in the Jordan Valley.</p>

<p>There was also a complete network outage at Jawwal, one of the two main telecommunications companies in the Palestinian territories of Gaza and the West Bank, according to the Reuters witness.</p>

<p>Palestinian health authorities said at least 12 Palestinians were killed in Wednesday's operations.</p>

<p>In Jenin earlier, bulldozers edged along empty, rubbish-strewn streets as the sound of drones pierced the sky.</p>

<p>Israeli troops searched ambulances on deserted city streets and in front of Jenin's main hospital, having blocked off access to it on Wednesday to prevent fighters from seeking refuge there.</p>

<p>Israel said one of the five fighters killed in the Tulkarm mosque was Muhhamad Jabber, known as "Abu Shujaa", the head of a network of fighters in the Nur Shams refugee camp next to the city.</p>

<p>The Tulkarm division of Islamic Jihad's armed wing said: "As part of the response to the assassination of our leader, our fighters were able to ambush an infantry force in the Manshiyya axis behind Abu Ubaida Mosque".</p>

<p>The group claimed "direct hits" on Israeli troops after it detonated an explosive device near them.</p>

<p>The armed wings of the Hamas, Islamic Jihad and Fatah factions said in separate statements on Wednesday their gunmen were detonating bombs against Israeli military vehicles in Jenin, Tulkarm and Far'a, a town in the Jordan Valley.</p>

<p>Clashes in the West Bank have escalated since Israel's war with Hamas began in Gaza nearly 11 months ago.</p>

<h3><strong>Escalating Clashes</strong></h3>

<p>Israel says Iran provides weapons and support to factions there and has stepped up West Bank operations, while Jewish settlers have launched frequent vigilante-style attacks on Palestinian communities.</p>

<p>Referring to the latest West Bank assault, Israel's foreign minister Israel Katz said in a post on X overnight: "This is a war in every sense, and we must win it."</p>

<p>He accused Iran of working to destabilize Jordan and establish an eastern front against Israel, like it has done in Gaza and in Lebanon, where Israel has been trading almost daily fire with operatives from the Iranian proxy group Hezbollah.</p>

<p>To address the threat of an eastern front, Katz said Israel would have to use "all necessary means, including, in cases of intense combat, allowing the population to temporarily evacuate from one neighbourhood to another to prevent civilian harm".</p>

<p>In nearby Gaza, evacuation orders have displaced nearly all of the enclave's 2.3 million people multiple times, giving rise to deadly hunger and disease.</p>

<p>The latest round of Israeli-Palestinian violence began on Oct. 7 after Hamas stormed from Gaza into southern Israel, killing 1,200 and taking more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli figures.</p>

<p>Israel's Gaza campaign has since demolished swathes of the enclave, and killed more than 40,500 people, Palestinian health officials say.</p>

<p>Internationally mediated talks to end the conflict continue.</p>

<p>Since the Gaza war began, thousands of Palestinians have been arrested in West Bank and East Jerusalem raids and more than 660 - fighters and civilians - have been killed, according to Palestinian health ministry figures.</p>

<p>At least 30 Israelis have been killed in attacks in Jerusalem and the West Bank during the period, according to Israeli tallies.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>United States' Federal Bureau of Investigation or FBI, which is investigating the assassination attempt on Donald Trump at the Republican rally in Pennsylvania last month, has revealed that the gunman Thomas Crooks acted alone.</p>

<p>The FBI said it has found no evidence of any foreign involvement in the case. The investigating agency however said that the motive behind the assassination attempt still remains unclear.</p>

<p>Sharing details about the gunman's search history, the FBI said, Thomas Crooks, 20, has varied ideologies. They also also shared photos of the weapon used and said they had found Improvised Explosive Devices or IEDs in his vehicle.</p>

<p class="ins_instory_dv_caption">Improvised Explosive Devices or IEDs were found in Thomas Gates' vehicle.</p>
</div>

<p>Speaking about Thomas Crooks' search history, the FBI revealed that he had searched more than 60 times for information about the Republican presidential candidate, as well as his then-rival, Democratic candidate and President Joe Biden. The gunman's online searches date as far back as September 2023. After nearly a year-long extensive search, the gunman chose to register for the Trump rally.</p>

<p>The FBI explained that the gunman had mounted a "sustained, detailed effort" to attack a major gathering of some sort before finally deciding to target the Republican presidential candidate at the rally in Pennsylvania in July.</p>

<p>"We saw a sustained, detailed effort to plan an attack on some events, meaning he looked at any number of events or targets," Kevin Rojek, the FBI's top official in western Pennsylvania, told reporters.</p>

<p>Mr Rojek further said that Crooks became "hyper-focused" on the Trump rally when it was announced "and looked at it as a target of opportunity."</p>

<p>The assassination attempt on Donald Trump took place on July 13, 2024 when the former president was addressing a Republican campaign rally in Buttler, Pennsylvania. The shooter Thomas Crooks, was from Bethel Park, a village 40 miles south of where Trump's rally was held.</p>

<p>Crooks fired multiple gunshots from an AR-15-style rifle during the rally, of which, one grazed Donald Trump's ear. The shooter planted himself on the roof of a manufacturing plant located around 130 yards away from the stage at Butler Farm Show grounds. While Donald Trump survived the assassination bid with the US Secret Service agents storming the stage to protect him, the shooting led to the death of one civilian and caused severe injuries to two others.</p>

<p>Last week, I visited my favourite cafe in South London, known for its Illy coffee beans that I relish. As I savoured my coffee, a young man, wearing a sleeveless hoodie and shorts, casually walked in. He was carrying a hold-all bag, and I thought he had just come from the gym. But he had other plans. In the blink of an eye, he swept every last sandwich into his bag from a stocked shelf. As he walked past me, our eyes met. I thought about confronting him but instead took another sip of my coffee and pretended to be engrossed in my smartphone. The lone waiter and the manager behind the counter seemed helpless or perhaps paralysed with fear. The boy walked out as if he had come in for his daily grocery shopping.</p>

<p>I turned to the manager, still tucked safely behind his counter, and asked whether he would report the incident to the police. Still shaken, he gave me a weary smile and said there was no point calling the police. He explained that shoplifting under £200 was not worth reporting. In fact, a 2014 law had categorised shoplifting as a "low-value" crime, inviting minimal or no punishment.</p>

<p>London is a paradise for shoplifters. But it's not the only one. Shoplifting cases are spiralling out of control across the UK. According to the Office for National Statistics, last year was the worst on record for shoplifting, with police recording 4,30,000 offences. The retailers' body, the British Retail Consortium, says these figures are a fraction of the actual incidents, many of which are not reported for fear of violence. The body believes the cases crossed 8 million last year, with retailers losing over £1.8 billion.</p>

<h2><strong>A Broken Britain</strong></h2>

<p>Far-right politicians claim, without much evidence, that shoplifting is a pastime of 'illegal' immigrants. That they exist outside the system and therefore escape scrutiny. These politicians lament the fact that the country's resources are being overwhelmed as huge amounts of money are being spent on housing and feeding immigrants.</p>

<p>However, human rights activists and community workers believe the alarming rise in shoplifting is linked to a grave cost of living crisis. Brexit and then the Covid-19 pandemic led to an upswing in unemployment and pushed scores of communities below the poverty line. There are numerous reports that claim that much of Britain's woes are due to its breaking free from the European Union and its inability to deal with the devastating pandemic.</p>

<h2><strong>"We Haven't Got Food Tonight. Can You Help?"</strong></h2>

<p>Poverty has affected many deprived communities and pushed them into a situation where they have become dependent on food charities. A recent report by Bristol University cited a pupil's letter to his school, saying, "We haven't got any food tonight. Please can you help?" The university research, focusing on food charity in schools, revealed that there are over 4,000 school-based food banks in primary and secondary schools across England. This is in addition to various charities - including some run by Indian Sikhs - that run food banks both in schools and at other places.</p>

<p>Great Britain is manifestly becoming poorer. Even for a casual visitor to the country, it's hard to miss its bloated underbelly. Many years ago, a White colleague visiting Mumbai from London was shocked to see scores of homeless people sleeping under flyovers and on footpaths. She told me she was genuinely moved by the squalor. London's homeless may be fewer in number than India's, but they are ubiquitous.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>A Deeply Unequal Society</strong></h2>

<p>The decline is visible everywhere. Wherever you go in London - or even other big cities in Britain - you cannot miss homeless people along the high streets and open public spaces. They sleep or rest in beds made of cardboard and tattered blankets. They take refuge under railway bridges and public parks, where benches serve as their beds. They look fatigued and lost.</p>

<p>Despite its wealth, London has pockets of severe poverty and deprivation. Child poverty rates are higher in London than in any other English region. London's crime rates are higher than any other major European cities, with rising concerns about knife attacks, gang violence and terrorism.</p>

<p>Beneath London's gleaming surface lies social inequalities, economic woes, and extreme poverty that form the city's dark netherworld. The wealth gap between the rich and the poor is staggering, with the top 10% of earners holding 30% of the city's income.</p>

<h2><strong>Historical perspective</strong></h2>

<p>Though it wasn't always like this, London, and much of England, has been through a cycle of decay and regeneration. A very impressionable young Trinidadian writer, CLR James, visited England in 1932. His portrayal of London in the 1930s in Letter from London could be true of today's time as well. "I saw London with new eyes; I saw the vast multitudes toiling to make a few wealthy; I saw the rich with their money, their resources, their million servants, exploiting the great, blind, unconscious masses of the poor," he observed in one of his essays. In another place, he captured his uneasy feeling thus, "I feel both a stranger and a prisoner, trapped in a society that is indifferent to the suffering of the majority and obsessed with its own decline."</p>

<p>Today, too, much like in the 1930s, many here have started complaining that Britain is broken. Its economy is stagnating, its politics is divisive, and its society is in disarray. Actually, Prime Minister Keir Starmer has been saying for a long time that the UK's "economy is broken, the health service is broken, and public service is broken". His Labour Party was voted to power in the July election on its promise of fixing a "broken Britain".</p>

<h2><strong>India Is Marching Ahead</strong></h2>

<p>It's true that the British economy has been stagnating for years. But the country was far ahead of India in 2014, which was the world's 10th biggest economy at the time. Over the years, however, India grew steadily. In 2021, it left the UK behind and became the fifth-largest economy in the world. The Indian government's economic policies stand in sharp contrast to the lacklustre vision of successive British governments over 15 years. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government ensured that India had political and economic stability and continuity. Britain was not that lucky, seeing six different governments led by six different prime ministers in the same period.</p>

<p>After being voted to power, Prime Minister Keir Starmer said he had "a lot of mess to fix", blaming the outgoing Tory government that had been in power from 2010 to 2024 for leading the country here. As historian Niall Ferguson notes, "The UK's decline is a long-term process, driven by a combination of factors, including economic mismanagement, social inequality, and political polarisation".</p>

<p>As a first step towards "fixing the mess", Starmer has proposed to raise taxes. But that is likely to be seen as a betrayal because the party had promised not to increase taxation. The Prime Minister has even warned that the forthcoming budget is "going to be painful". It will get worse, he said, before it gets better.</p>

<p>While the debate rages on in the media, Starmer quietly set out on an official trip to Germany and France to "reset" Britain's relations with Europe.&nbsp;If all goes well, this reset might help Britain steady the post-Brexit ship.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[The recent Democratic National Convention in Chicago was a showcase of impressive speeches.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The recent Democratic National Convention in Chicago was a <a href="https://theconversation.com/kamala-harris-and-her-fellow-democrats-used-ancient-greek-rhetorical-tricks-to-keep-their-audiences-spellbound-237406">showcase of impressive speeches</a>. Presidential nominee Kamala Harris <a href="https://theconversation.com/harris-delivers-warm-and-strong-acceptance-speech-as-democrats-take-joy-hope-and-renewal-to-the-electorate-237136">justified the newfound enthusiasm of Democrats</a> with a strong acceptance speech, but even she couldn't match the oratorical power of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9zAk8t9qZ8">Michelle</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwLmOI6r_XY">Barack</a> Obama two nights earlier.</p>

<p class="theconversation-article-title">US political culture is marked by visionary speeches, from Abraham Lincoln's <a href="https://www.loc.gov/resource/rbpe.24404500/?st=text">Gettysburg Address</a> and William Jennings Bryan's “<a href="https://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/5354/">Cross of gold</a>” to Martin Luther King's “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smEqnnklfYs">I have a dream</a>” and Ronald Reagan's “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WX00QkvK-mQ">Tear down this wall</a>”. This rhetorical tradition infuses events such as party conventions, where memorable speeches can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWynt87PaJ0">lay the groundwork for presidential careers</a>.</p>

<p class="theconversation-article-title">Australia also has some justly famous political speeches. There was Robert Menzies' “<a href="https://www.menziesrc.org/the-forgotten-people">Forgotten People</a>” address of 1942, Paul Keating's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6dnDkvdTXA">Redfern speech</a> in 1992, and Julia Gillard's “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCNuPcf8L00">misogyny speech</a>” to parliament in 2012. Noel Pearson's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsXmYHiuJ8s">eulogy for Gough Whitlam</a> in 2014 was a <a href="https://theconversation.com/a-closer-look-at-noel-pearsons-eulogy-for-gough-whitlam-33932">rhetorical masterpiece</a>.</p>

<p class="theconversation-article-title">But these speeches are memorable because they are so rare. Australian politicians need to be good communicators, but they are not expected to deliver the kind of soaring, visionary rhetoric we see so often in the US. Why is this?</p>

<h3 class="theconversation-article-title"><strong>Politics with the soul of a church.</strong></h3>

<p class="theconversation-article-title">US party conventions often look like <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/08/23/chicago-dnc-obama-clinton-harris-walz/">Hollywood awards ceremonies</a>, and <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/politics-news/steven-spielberg-biden-campaign-democratic-national-convention-plan-1235882108/">Steven Spielberg was involved in the planning</a> of the recent DNC. Hollywood has become an indelible part of US political culture.</p>

<p class="theconversation-article-title">Reagan, a former Hollywood actor, set new standards for how <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/nov/12/the-reagans-showtime-docuseries">telegenic</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTIfGFJqLko">entertaining</a> presidents could be. Donald Trump may not be everyone's idea of a great orator, but the former reality TV star is certainly a <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2024/7/17/trump-elections-and-the-politics-of-spectacle">master of televised spectacles</a>.</p>

<p class="theconversation-article-title">The tradition of preaching is an even deeper cultural source of US political rhetoric. With about <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/245491/church-attendance-of-americans/">30% of Americans attending religious services regularly</a>, the sermon is the most prevalent form of public speech in the US.</p>

<p class="theconversation-article-title">American preachers need to be compelling, given the level of religious competition, and church is where many future politicians first encounter the craft of public speaking. American political speeches often reflect the combination of <a href="https://www.preaching.com/articles/should-the-sermon-beat-up-or-lift-up/">uplift and warning</a> found in preaching.</p>

<p class="theconversation-article-title">While evangelical Christianity is usually associated with the Republican Party, it is also in the DNA of Democrats because of the <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2021/02/16/a-brief-overview-of-black-religious-history-in-the-u-s/">Civil Rights Movement and the black church</a>. One of the standout speakers of the DNC was <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2024/08/raphael-warnock-dnc-speech/">Georgia Senator Raphael Warnock</a>, senior pastor of the <a href="https://time.com/5927777/martin-luther-king-warnock-history/">same Baptist church in Atlanta where Martin Luther King Jr preached</a>.</p>

<p class="theconversation-article-title">Warnock described Trump in biblical terms as a “plague on the American conscience”. But he also described a vote as “a kind of prayer for the world we desire for ourselves and for our children”.</p>

<p class="theconversation-article-title">Australia has no shortage of politicians who were raised as Christians and have Christian commitments. But unlike in the US, where even secular politicians must pay lip service to prayer, Christian politicians in Australia must <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/oct/27/scott-morrison-is-a-pentecostal-but-he-doesnt-need-believers-like-trump-does">adapt themselves</a> to the <a href="https://theconversation.com/a-christian-nation-no-longer-why-australias-religious-right-loses-policy-battles-even-when-it-wins-elections-165169">secularism of Australian culture</a>. This culture does not expect politicians to preach.</p>

<h3 class="theconversation-article-title"><strong>Strong speeches for weak parties</strong></h3>

<p class="theconversation-article-title">Michelle Grattan last week described Australian party conferences as “<a href="https://theconversation.com/grattan-on-friday-presidential-battle-showcases-the-differences-between-us-political-system-and-ours-237313">mind-numbing</a>” compared with the “Hollywood extravaganzas” of their US counterparts.</p>

<p class="theconversation-article-title">But the spectacles at US party conventions testify to the <a href="https://washingtonmonthly.com/2024/06/27/why-are-political-parties-so-much-weaker-than-they-once-were/">weakness</a> of American political parties. The Democratic and Republican National Committees have <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/world/modern-politics-public-is-more-partisan-parties-are-more-powerless-idUSL1N12Z2QO/">little power</a>. Party organisations are localised and fragmented. They lack the central authority found in Australian parties, and the national convention every four years is the only time a nationwide party truly comes into existence.</p>

<p class="theconversation-article-title">Even in Congress, parties have few mechanisms for <a href="https://jackson.yale.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Kustov-et-al.-2021.pdf">disciplining their members</a>. Party leaders are forced to negotiate with their own side, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/oct/03/kevin-mccarthy-oust-republican-house-speaker-vote-result-matt-gaetz">not always successfully</a>. Party conventions see an extravagant display of unity behind a newly nominated candidate. This is one of the few moments party unity is guaranteed.</p>

<p class="theconversation-article-title">While there is plenty of competition for power within Australian parties, in Australia it mostly takes place <a href="https://theconversation.com/why-party-preselections-are-still-a-mess-and-the-courts-havent-helped-181054">behind closed doors within party hierarchies</a>. In the US, would-be legislators and executives need to campaign publicly to win the often brutal primary elections that earn them the party's nomination.</p>

<p class="theconversation-article-title">Successful candidates must create their own personalised campaigns. They have help from local party organisations, which coordinate resources and volunteers, but they need much more than that. A candidate for national office must build their own coalition of donors that would <a href="https://issueone.org/articles/the-congressional-fundraising-treadmill-2022-election/">dwarf</a> anything a party could provide.</p>

<p class="theconversation-article-title">Hence the need for good speech-making. Competition for the attention of donors and voters is fierce, and a compelling speech is a vital way to stand out. This is especially true of <a href="https://sg.news.yahoo.com/obama-once-democratic-outsider-now-043532690.html">candidates such as Barack Obama</a>, who came from outside the party's traditional power bases.</p>

<p class="theconversation-article-title">In Australia, inspirational speeches don't have the same political currency. A system of <a href="https://theconversation.com/politicians-inability-to-speak-freely-on-issues-that-matter-leaves-democracy-all-the-poorer-60055">strict party discipline</a>, small preselection contests and <a href="https://thedailyaus.com.au/stories/heres-why-us-election-campaigns-are-so-expensive-and-australia-is-a-bit-cheaper/">short, relatively cheap election campaigns</a> means candidates are rewarded more for other political skills.</p>

<h3 class="theconversation-article-title"><strong>The Australian advantage: debating</strong></h3>

<p class="theconversation-article-title">While a US politician might give a more entertaining stump speech than an Australian one, an Australian politician would probably perform better in any scenario that requires unscripted comments – especially a debate with an opponent.</p>

<p class="theconversation-article-title">Even superb US political orators can be <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2016/09/25/politics/obama-debate-election-2012/index.html">underwhelming</a> when they don't have a script and a receptive audience. Congressional debates consist of prepared speeches with little direct engagement between opponents. There is no equivalent to <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13572334.2014.895121">Parliamentary Question Time</a>, and holders of executive office (such as the president or state governors) aren't even in the legislature.</p>

<p class="theconversation-article-title">While Congressional committee hearings can sometimes provide a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/senate-mullin-obrien-teamsters-fight-hearing-153e28d131973d1e10b539491c9e94a6">simulation of the rowdiness</a> we associate with Question Time, the structure of Congress isn't conducive to debate in the same way.</p>

<p class="theconversation-article-title">The physical format of Westminster parliaments, with opponents facing each other directly, attests to an adversarial nature that was <a href="https://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/building/palace/architecture/palace-s-interiors/commons-chamber/">there from the beginning</a>. The power of Gillard's “misogyny speech”, which went viral globally, came partly from the way she delivered it <a href="https://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/julia-gillard-misogyny-speech/8r2ue1lt9">straight into Tony Abbott's face</a>.</p>

<p class="theconversation-article-title">US Congress was designed differently. The framers of the Constitution loathed the idea of <a href="https://www.history.com/news/founding-fathers-political-parties-opinion">factions</a>, and imagined a legislature made up of representatives who would negotiate with each other to find consensus. Congress in turn would have to negotiate with the president, who would <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_the_Union">rarely need to engage publicly</a> with its members.</p>

<p class="theconversation-article-title">This may explain why, despite the routine brilliance of convention speeches, US presidential debates are so tedious and forgettable. Commentators who try to hype these debates by citing “great moments” from past debates inevitably reach for the same ancient zinger, “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iDn6ndavA0">you're no Jack Kennedy</a>”, delivered by forgotten vice-presidential candidate Lloyd Bentsen in 1988.</p>

<p class="theconversation-article-title">The sad reality is that the most memorable and consequential presidential debate in living memory is the one we just saw, where Joe Biden performed so badly he ended his hopes of a second presidency.</p>

<p>Republican former president Trump, itching to take the limelight back from Harris after her rapid rise, will separately be campaigning in the battleground states of Michigan and Wisconsin on Thursday.</p>

<p>The CNN encounter with journalist Dana Bash, which is being broadcast at 9:00 pm local time (0100 GMT Friday) will be the first in-depth interview for <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/video/kamala-harris-and-tim-walz-s-first-interview-of-campaign-830815" target="_blank">Harris and Walz</a> since President Joe Biden dropped out of the White House race on July 21.</p>

<p>It is also the first since the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, which saw the party riding a wave of energy following her nomination.</p>

<p>Harris's spokesman Ian Sams responded to the Republican criticisms by saying the "joint ticket interview is an election year summer tradition going back 20 years."</p>

<p>He cited previous interviews given "almost always" around convention time, including by Trump and his then-running mate Mike Pence, and Biden and Harris.</p>

<p>"Harris/Walz join this rich tradition on CNN tomorrow," Sams said on X.</p>

<p>But then, the 2024 election is anything but traditional.</p>

<p>A relatively untested Harris, 59, has been thrust onto the campaign stage at record speed after one of the biggest upheavals in <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/donald-trump-rally-shooting-long-history-of-shootings-in-us-presidential-politics-6101507" target="_blank">US political history</a>.</p>

<p>Yet so far she has only had a handful of exchanges with reporters on the campaign trail.</p>

<h3><strong>Human shield</strong></h3>

<p>Her failure to give an interview or press conference in that time has given Republicans fodder for attacks, saying voters have been left in the dark about her policies.</p>

<p>"They have a candidate they can't wheel out to the media," Trump spokesman Jason Miller told Newsmax on Wednesday.</p>

<p>"What they're going to do is they're going to use Tim Walz as a human shield for Kamala Harris," Miller said.</p>

<p>Trump has done a series of interviews in recent weeks, but they have mainly been with sympathetic interviewers including X boss Elon Musk. He has also given two press conferences, which included long monologues.</p>

<p>Harris said on August 8 that she wanted to get an interview scheduled by the end of the month, so she has just lived up to her pledge.</p>

<p>Her interview will be closely watched in an extraordinary year where big set-piece political events have shown their ability to produce surprises.</p>

<p>It was <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/joe-biden-vs-donald-trump-presidential-debate-when-and-where-to-watch-5984315" target="_blank">Joe Biden's</a> stumbling performance during a June 27 debate with Trump -- coincidentally also on CNN -- that caused Democrats to dump him over fears about his age and mental acuity.</p>

<p>Further adding to the pressure is the fact that Harris developed a reputation for word salads and gaffes in unscripted settings earlier in her spell as vice president.</p>

<p>In one notorious exchange with NBC in 2021, after Biden designated her to look into the causes of illegal migration, she insisted that "we've been to the border" with Mexico even when she had not.</p>

<p>Pressed further, she retorted "And I haven't been to Europe" before breaking into a laugh.</p>

<p>Republicans have since used the exchange to hammer Harris over the border issue, one of the Democrats' biggest vulnerabilities heading into the election.</p>

<p>As a former prosecutor, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/video/us-election-watch-kamala-harris-targets-crucial-swing-state-georgia-831195" target="_blank">Harris</a> may well be looking to her first debate with Trump on September 10 to make a bigger impact.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kamala Harris' campaign for US president has hired an Egyptian American lawyer and former Department of Homeland Security official to help lead outreach to Arab American voters who hold sway in some states that could help decide the November 5 election, the campaign said on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Brenda Abdelall would be tasked with shoring up support from a community frustrated with&nbsp;US support for Israel's war in Gaza. Vice President Harris, a Democrat, has already hired Afghan American lawyer Nasrina Bargzie for outreach to Muslim Americans.</p>

<p>Harris is in a tight race with Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. Votes from Muslim and Arab Americans could help decide the outcome in battleground states like Michigan, which has seen street protests over the Israel-Gaza war.</p>

<p>US&nbsp;President Joe Biden won a large share of the Arab and Muslim vote in 2020, but his support for Israel despite the huge death count in Gaza has frustrated many community members. They launched an "uncommitted" campaign against him in the Democratic nominating contests.</p>

<p>Michigan, where Harris is due to visit next week, is home to one of the largest Muslim and Arab American populations in the United States. More than 100,000 voters cast their ballot "uncommitted" instead of Biden, who stepped aside as candidate on July 21, in the state's primary.</p>

<p>Some activists say they hold Harris responsible for the Biden administration's Israel policy and the crisis in Gaza.</p>

<p>Following last week's Democratic convention, pro-Palestinian activists said Harris had failed to demonstrate any break from the status quo.</p>

<p>While pro-Palestinian voices are not expected to vote for Trump and have indicated no support for the Republican, some activists have launched a campaign called "Abandon Harris" and have urged their supporters to back third-party candidates.</p>

<p>Abdelall, Harris' pick for Arab American outreach, most recently served as senior counsellor to the Department of Homeland Security's secretary. She joined the agency in January 2021, shortly after Trump left office, to be chief of staff for the department's civil rights office.</p>

<p>Abdelall, who grew up in Ann Arbor, Michigan, previously ran a food blog and website focused on Middle Eastern cuisine. She has taught Middle Eastern cooking classes at a culinary school in northern Virginia.</p>

<p>The latest bloodshed in the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict was triggered on Oct. 7 when Palestinian Islamist group Hamas attacked Israel, killing 1,200 and taking about 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.</p>

<p>Israel's subsequent assault on the Hamas-governed enclave has since killed over 40,000 Palestinians, according to the local health ministry, while also displacing nearly the entire population of 2.3 million, causing a hunger crisis and leading to genocide allegations at the World Court that Israel denies.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As a part of the national survey to preempt the Glacial Lake Outburst Flood (GLOF), the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) has started surveying the Eastern Himalayas to map all glacial lakes in the country and assess the feasibility of installing early warning sensors and other mitigation measures. The agency is conducting surveys in Arunachal Pradesh and Sikkim, the two important areas of the Eastern Himalayas along the China border.</p>

<p>Expert teams have fanned out to carry out a survey-cum-study at <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/experts-sent-to-6-high-risk-glacial-lakes-in-arunachal-to-assess-flood-risk-6384947" target="_blank">six high-risk glacial lakes</a> in Tawang and Dibang Valley districts in Arunachal Pradesh, which shares a 1,080 km-long border with China. There are reports of the washing away of more than five bridges due to a glacial lake outburst from Sangnga Nehgu Lake in the Tawang district. It is also the first such survey of glacial lakes in the border state.</p>

<p>Sikkim has also sent an expedition of 32 experts to five <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/plans-on-to-tackle-dangerous-glacial-lakes-in-himalayas-6389964" target="_blank">under-threat glacial lakes</a> - Gurudongmar A, B, and C, Sakho Chu, and Khangchu, all in the Mangan district, which borders Tibet.</p>

<p>The experts will survey the lakes from August 28 to September 14 at an estimated cost of Rs 32 lakh.</p>

<p>The expedition is being led by State Science and Technology Secretary Sandeep Tambe along with experts from six different departments of the State Disaster Management Authority (SDMA) under the Land Revenue Department, Mines and Geology, Water Resources, Forest, Science and Technology and research scholars from Sikkim University.</p>

<p>The expedition will also be aided by the Indian Army and Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) with a collective manpower of 56 individuals including drivers and porters...</p>

<p>"We are going to do very hi-tech studies to understand the geology of the glacial lake, understand the glacial behaviours, study the slope stability and probabilities of avalanches and GLOF. This will be a study at an altitude of 18,000 feet. Once our study is done, we will plan the mitigation plan," said Sandeep Tambe, Secretary of the Science and Technology Department, Sikkim.</p>

<p>The previous expedition was carried out by the NDMA and experts from Switzerland before the 2023 lake outburst in South Lhonak in Sikkim.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Countries adopting their own AI applications and models will contribute about low double-digit billions to Nvidia's revenue in the financial year ending in January 2025, Nvidia forecasts]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nations building artificial intelligence models in their own languages are turning to Nvidia's chips, adding to already booming demand as generative AI takes center stage for businesses and governments, a senior executive said on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Nvidia's third-quarter forecast for rising sales of its chips that power AI technology such as OpenAI's ChatGPT failed to meet investors' towering expectations. But the company described new customers coming from around the world, including governments that are now seeking their own AI models and the hardware to support them.</p>

<p>Countries adopting their own AI applications and models will contribute about low double-digit billions to Nvidia's revenue in the financial year ending in January 2025, Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress said on a call with analysts after Nvidia's earnings report.</p>

<p>That's up from an earlier forecast of such sales contributing high single-digit billions to total revenue. Nvidia forecast about $32.5 billion in total revenue in the third quarter ending in October.</p>

<p>"Countries around the world (desire) to have their own generative AI that would be able to incorporate their own language, incorporate their own culture, incorporate their own data in that country," Kress said, describing AI expertise and infrastructure as "national imperatives."</p>

<p>She offered the example of Japan's National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, which is building an AI supercomputer featuring thousands of Nvidia H200 graphics processors.</p>

<p>Governments are also turning to AI as a measure to strengthen national security.</p>

<p>"AI models are trained on data and for political entities -particularly nations - their data are secret, and their models need to be customized to their unique political, economic, cultural, and scientific needs," said IDC computing semiconductors analyst Shane Rau.</p>

<p>"Therefore, they need to have their own AI models and a custom underlying arrangement of hardware and software."</p>

<p>Washington tightened its controls on exports of cutting-edge chips to China in 2023 as it sought to prevent breakthroughs in AI that would aid China's military, hampering Nvidia's sales in the region.</p>

<p>Businesses have been working to tap into government pushes to build AI platforms in regional languages.</p>

<p>IBM said in May that Saudi Arabia's Data and Artificial Intelligence Authority would train its "ALLaM" Arabic language model using the company's AI platform Watsonx.</p>

<p>Nations that want to create their own AI models can drive growth opportunities for Nvidia's GPUs, on top of the significant investments in the company's hardware from large cloud providers like Microsoft, said Bob O'Donnell, chief analyst at TECHnalysis Research.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="theconversation-article-title">Plastic is in our clothes, cars, mobile phones, water bottles and food containers. But recent research adds to growing concerns about the impact of tiny plastic fragments on our health.</p>

<div class="theconversation-article-body">
<p>A <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11100893/">study</a> from the United States has, for the first time, found microplastics in human brains. The study, which has yet to be independently verified by other scientists, has been described in the media as <a href="https://people.com/study-microplastics-found-in-brain-tissue-liver-kidneys-and-lungs-8700882">scary</a>, <a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/percentage-brains-microplastics">shocking</a> and <a href="https://www.ecowatch.com/microplastics-contamination-human-brain-health.html">alarming</a>.</p>

<p>But what exactly are microplastics? What do they mean for our health? Should we be concerned?</p>

<h3><strong>What are microplastics? Can you see them?</strong></h3>

<p>We often consider plastic items to be indestructible. But plastic breaks down into <a href="https://www.epa.gov/water-research/microplastics-research">smaller particles</a>. Definitions vary but generally, microplastics are smaller than five millimetres.</p>

<p>This makes some too small to be seen with the naked eye. So, many of the images the media uses to illustrate articles about microplastics are misleading, as some show much larger, clearly visible pieces.</p>

<p>Microplastics have been reported in many sources of <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0043135419301794">drinking water</a> and <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969722069340?casa_token=VSEsoEXWnjQAAAAA:M1PYZLjEQtqb1bojduo6awulmd6rOwvva6pAhq0aJK_Zv7DZmTGRUAf18BHqM67lgLC7tRNOkw">everyday food items</a>. This means we are constantly exposed to them in our diet.</p>

<p>Such widespread, chronic (long-term) exposure makes this a serious concern for human health. While research investigating the potential risk microplastics pose to our health is limited, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10038118/">it is growing</a>.</p>

<h3><strong>How about this latest study?</strong></h3>

<p>The <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11100893/">study</a> looked at concentrations of microplastics in 51 samples from men and women set aside from routine autopsies in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Samples were from the liver, kidney and brain.</p>

<p>These tiny particles are difficult to study due to their size, even with a high-powered microscope. So rather than trying to see them, researchers are beginning to use complex instruments that identify the chemical composition of microplastics in a sample. This is the technique used in this study.</p>

<p>The researchers were surprised to find up to 30 times more microplastics in brain samples than in the liver and kidney.</p>

<p>They hypothesised this could be due to high blood flow to the brain (carrying plastic particles with it). Alternatively, the liver and kidneys might be better suited to dealing with external toxins and particles. We also know the brain does not undergo the same amount of cellular renewal as other organs in the body, which could make the plastics linger here.</p>

<p>The researchers also found the amount of plastics in brain samples increased by about 50% between 2016 and 2024. This may reflect the rise in environmental plastic pollution and increased <a href="https://www.unep.org/interactives/beat-plastic-pollution/">human exposure</a>.</p>

<p>The microplastics found in this study were mostly composed of polyethylene. This is the most <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-323-37100-1.00002-8">commonly produced</a> plastic in the world and is used for many everyday products, such as bottle caps and plastic bags.</p>

<p>This is the first time microplastics have been found in human brains, which is important. However, this study is a “pre-print”, so other independent microplastics researchers haven't yet reviewed or validated the study.</p>

<h3><strong>How do microplastics end up in the brain?</strong></h3>

<p>Microplastics typically enter the body through contaminated food and water. This can disrupt the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304389423020848?via%3Dihub">gut microbiome</a> (the community of microbes in your gut) and cause inflammation. This leads to effects in the whole body via the immune system and the complex, two-way communication system between the gut and the brain. This so-called <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1467-3045/46/5/256">gut-brain axis</a> is implicated in many aspects of health and disease.</p>

<p>We can also <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304389421010888">breathe in</a> airborne microplastics. Once these particles are in the gut or lungs, they can move into the bloodstream and then travel around the body into <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030438942201932X?via%3Dihub">various organs</a>.</p>

<p>Studies have found microplastics in human <a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.1c03924">faeces</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2023.132640">joints</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ebiom.2022.104147">livers</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.167760">reproductive organs</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2022.107199">blood</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0280594">vessels</a> and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.2c07179">hearts</a>.</p>

<p>Microplastics also migrate to the brains of <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36711285/">wild fish</a>. In <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.128431">mouse studies</a>, ingested microplastics are absorbed from the gut into the blood and can enter the brain, becoming lodged in other <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/srep46687">organs</a> along the way.</p>

<p>To get into brain tissue, microplastics must cross the <a href="https://theconversation.com/our-blood-brain-barrier-stops-bugs-and-toxins-getting-to-our-brain-heres-how-it-works-230965">blood-brain-barrier</a>, an intricate layer of cells that is supposed to keep things in the blood from entering the brain.</p>

<p>Although concerning, this is not surprising, as microplastics must cross similar cell barriers to enter the <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2305-6304/11/1/40">urine</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.165922">testes</a> and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2023.140301">placenta</a>, where they have already been found in humans.</p>

<h3><strong>Is this a health concern?</strong></h3>

<p>We don't yet know the effects of microplastics in the human brain. Some laboratory experiments suggest microplastics increase <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045653522007548">brain inflammation</a> and <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S001393512301215X?via%3Dihub">cell damage</a>, alter <a href="https://particleandfibretoxicology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12989-020-00358-y">gene expression</a> and change <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304389421027849">brain structure</a>.</p>

<p>Aside from the effects of the microplastic particles themselves, microplastics might also pose risks if they carry <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0269749123021929">environmental toxins</a> or <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10661-023-11890-7">bacteria </a> into and around the body.</p>

<p><a href="https://annalsofglobalhealth.org/articles/10.5334/aogh.4459?_rsc=13r6v">Various plastic chemicals</a> could also leach out of the microplastics into the body. These include the famous <a href="https://theconversation.com/science-shows-that-bpa-and-other-endocrine-disruptors-are-harmful-to-human-health-which-should-incite-tighter-regulations-178872">hormone-disrupting chemicals</a> known as BPAs.</p>

<p>But microplastics and their effects are difficult to study. In addition to their small size, there are so many different types of plastics in the environment. More than <a href="https://www.unep.org/resources/report/chemicals-plastics-technical-report">13,000 different chemicals</a> have been identified in plastic products, with more being developed every year.</p>

<p>Microplastics are also weathered by the environment and digestive processes, and this is hard to reproduce in the lab.</p>

<p>A goal of our research is to understand how these factors change the way microplastics behave in the body. We plan to investigate if improving the integrity of the gut barrier through diet or probiotics can prevent the uptake of microplastics from the gut into the bloodstream. This may effectively stop the particles from circulating around the body and lodging into organs.</p>

<h3><strong>How do I minimise my exposure?</strong></h3>

<p>Microplastics are widespread in the environment, and it's difficult to avoid exposure. We are just <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10038118/">beginning to understand</a> how microplastics can affect our health.</p>

<p>Until we have more scientific evidence, the best thing we can do is reduce our <a href="https://www.cspinet.org/cspi-news/reduce-plastic-use-home-planets-health-and-ours">exposure to plastics</a> where we can and <a href="https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/House/Climate_Change_Energy_Environment_and_Water/Plasticpollution/Report/Chapter_3_-_A_national_approach_to_reducing_plastic_pollution">produce less plastic waste</a>, so less ends up in the environment.</p>

<p>An easy place to start is to avoid foods and drinks packaged in single-use plastic or reheated in plastic containers. We can also minimise exposure to synthetic fibres in our homes and clothing.<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.

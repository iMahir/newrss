       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk accused a senior NATO officer of Orwellian tendencies in a post on X Wednesday, a day after Donald Trump named the world's richest man to a top government post.</p>

<p>"Make Orwell Fiction Again! Guys like this think 1984 is an instruction manual," Musk wrote in response to a clip of Admiral Rob Bauer -- the chair of NATO's military committee -- speaking at a think tank event.</p>

<p>In remarks at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, Bauer warned of "disinformation and cyber attacks and all the things that are happening influencing elections," saying that the use of social media is "basically amplifying everything that is being done by bot factories."</p>

<p>"I'm very much in favor of freedom of speech, but I'm not necessarily convinced that what... Mr Musk is doing on X is the right approach," the admiral said.</p>

<p>The day before Musk made the comment about Bauer, Trump announced that he would lead a new US government efficiency group tasked with cutting federal waste -- a potentially powerful position in the administration.</p>

<p>Trump said Musk and businessman Vivek Ramaswamy "will pave the way for my Administration to dismantle Government Bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure Federal Agencies."</p>

<p>Musk became a key ally to Trump during his campaign, reportedly spending over $100 million to help the Republican win and repeatedly boosting Trump's candidacy on X, the platform he owns.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The world's longest nonstop commercial flights are getting a major upgrade. Singapore Airlines (SIA) recently announced a multi-year program worth 1.1 billion Singapore dollars (about $821 million) to install new long-haul cabin goods in its 41 Airbus A350-900 aircraft, reported <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/13/travel/singapore-airlines-a350-cabins-hnk-intl/index.html">CNN</a>. The ultra-long-range A350ULR, which operates on marathon routes such as nonstop flights from Singapore to New York, will also get four exclusive first-class seats. It only has business class and premium economy cabins.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
In a statement, SIA said the new A350-900 first and business-class products are “designed from the ground up, with a spacious layout and ergonomic elements that cater to every customer's needs.”<br />
<br />
Goh Choon Phong, CEO, SIA, said that over the past six years, the airline engaged customers and stakeholders to help design its next-generation long-haul cabin products, "anticipating their evolving preferences and expectations down to the finest detail."&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The new first class and business class seat designs will incorporate thoughtful elements that push the boundaries of comfort, luxury and modernity, allowing our customers to relax or work effortlessly on board, he added. "Premium economy class and economy class customers can also look forward to refreshed cabin interiors that enhance their travel experience," he said.<br />
<br />
The first retrofitted A350-900ULR is expected to enter service in the first quarter of 2027, while the first refitted A350-900 long-haul aircraft is anticipated to enter service in the second quarter of 2026. According to the airline, its next Boeing 777-9 aircraft will also have the revised seat designs.<br />
<br />
ULR in A350-900ULR stands for ultra-long-range flights. These seven aircraft are flown to and from the United States. They take 18 to 19 hours, on average, and cover over 9,500 miles between Singapore's Changi Airport and New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport.<br />
<br />
For now, passengers who wish to take advantage of SIA's most opulent offers can reserve a private "suite" on one of its Airbus A380s or a first-class seat on one of its Boeing 777 aircraft.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Technology executive Bob Lee's accused killer told a jury he acted in self-defense after Lee tried to attack him with a knife on a San Francisco street a year and a half ago, saying "he went crazy on me" after losing his temper.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Technology executive Bob Lee's accused killer told a jury he acted in self defense after Lee tried to attack him with a knife on a San Francisco street a year and a half ago, saying “he went crazy on me” after losing his temper.</p>

<p>Nima Momeni, defending himself at his murder trial, testified Wednesday that during a late night of socializing in April 2023, Lee became enraged, pulled a knife out of his jacket pocket and took a swing, before Momeni grabbed his arm and redirected the blade at his upper chest.</p>

<p>“I was in shock. I was just attacked,” Momeni told jurors. “This is not a normal situation.”</p>

<p>Lee was revered by the Bay Area's tech community as a master coder who helped develop Google's Android and Square's Cash App before becoming a top executive at MobileCoin. The slaying of the 43-year-old father of two drew nationwide attention and at first fueled speculation that he was a random victim of violence in a city falling into post-pandemic lawlessness.</p>

<p>The narrative shifted sharply when police arrested Momeni, a technology entrepreneur who knew Lee, and charged him with premeditated murder. Prosecutors have argued that Momeni was an “overprotective, wanna-be tough guy” who stabbed Lee following an argument over whether the executive had an inappropriate relationship with Momeni's sister, Khazar.</p>

<p><strong>‘Bad Joke'</strong></p>

<p>Momeni testified that after leaving Khazar's apartment in his car late at night, a friendly conservation between the two men quickly turned violent when Momeni made what he called a “bad joke.”</p>

<p>Lee “blew up” after Momeni suggested that “if it was my last night in town, I'd go hang out with my family” instead of going to strip clubs, Momeni testified, adding that his attempt to defuse the situation only made Lee angrier.</p>

<p>“I was afraid for my life,” Momeni testified under questioning from his own lawyer as he gave a blow-by-blow account of the physical confrontation that he says ended with Lee “casually” walking away, appearing to be uninjured, and Momeni throwing the knife over a fence. Lee died in the hospital hours after he called 911 for help and was found bleeding from multiple wounds, including one that pierced his heart.</p>

<p><strong>Binging on Cocaine</strong></p>

<p>Momeni's lawyers told the jury when the trial started a month ago that Lee had been binging on cocaine and sleeping little before he tried to attack Momeni.</p>

<p>In Wednesday's testimony, Momeni said he arrived in the US from Iran when he was 15, alongside his mother and sister, as they sought to escape his allegedly abusive father. He also said he'd been trained in Krav Maga, the Israeli military style of martial arts.</p>

<p>Momeni testified that he first met Lee just a couple of days before the fatal encounter, saying Khazar “always spoke highly of him.” When the two men met, Lee “was energized, super chatty,” Momeni said. “He was coming from a party. I forget which one.”</p>

<p>Momeni also said his sister's “drug addiction had taken over everything.” Drug use by Momeni, Khazar and Lee has been a frequent topic of witness testimony during the trial.</p>

<p>Following the fight with Lee, Momeni said he called his sister.</p>

<p><strong>‘Went Crazy'</strong></p>

<p>“Don't let him back in,” he recalled telling her. “He went crazy on me, tried to attack me.”</p>

<p>Momeni testified that when he later learned that Lee had died, he was “heartbroken, still to this point.”</p>

<p>“He attacked me but he didn't deserve this,” he said, as Lee's brother shook his head sitting in the courtroom gallery. “I didn't see this coming at all.”</p>

<p>Before Wednesday, the most dramatic testimony came from Khazar, who sought to defend her brother but acknowledged on the stand that her memory was foggy because she'd been on a drug bender before and after Lee's death.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[US President Joe Biden will meet his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, in Peru on Saturday for the last of three in-person sit-downs between the leaders during the US president's term in office.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden will meet his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, in Peru on Saturday for the last of three in-person sit-downs between the leaders during the US president's term in office, according to senior administration officials.</p>

<p>Both leaders will be in Lima for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum. They last saw each other in person a year ago at the same summit when Biden hosted Xi outside of San Francisco.</p>

<p>With his term ending, Biden will have significantly diminished power when he sits across from Xi, while the Chinese leader likely is already focused on dealing with Republican President-elect Donald Trump.</p>

<p>Trump for his second term in the White House has threatened to double down on his trade war with China, with plans to impose steep tariffs on all imports from the country.</p>

<p>The senior Biden administration officials, who requested anonymity to discuss the upcoming meeting, declined to comment when asked whether the US president planned to mention Trump or his proposed policies in his conversation with Xi. They also referred to Trump's transition team any questions on whether the incoming president and his advisers have been receiving - or requested - classified intelligence briefings on China.</p>

<h3><strong>US President Joe Biden</strong></h3>

<p>Presidential transitions are "uniquely consequential moments in geopolitics" and Biden will emphasize with Xi the need to maintain "stability, clarity, predictability" in the US-China relationship during this time, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said in a separate briefing with reporters Wednesday. He called competition with China "a paramount priority" for the next administration.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Unlike the Biden-Xi meeting in 2023, the focus this time will be less on delivering outcomes or building on progress they have made. Biden is instead expected to use their last face-to-face encounter as a check-in that gives him the chance to emphasize issues of concern.</p>

<p>Among them is China's ongoing support for Russia's defense industrial base, which a senior official said is unlikely to stop and therefore a topic that is going to occupy the incoming administration as well.</p>

<p>Still, Biden will be at pains to point out successes of his strategy of "intense diplomacy" with China, and progress on the three achievements the White House cited out of the leaders' last meeting in California: on military-to-military communications, counter-narcotics efforts and artificial intelligence - each an area where the US has sought to at east enhance dialogue with Chinese officials to limit misunderstanding and instability.</p>

<p>For Beijing, this might be an opportunity to take stock of bilateral ties, which have stabilized over the past year. The Xi-Biden meeting in 2023 has led to a flurry of diplomatic engagements and the restart of communication channels, helping to ease tensions at a time when the world's No. 2 economy is slowing.</p>

<p>But it may be hard for the momentum to continue. Trump has picked people with track records of being harsh on Beijing for key posts in his administration - especially China-sanctioned Marco Rubio as secretary of state, and Mike Waltz as national security adviser. This could bring fresh turbulence to US-China ties.</p>

<h3><strong>Alleged Hack</strong></h3>

<p>The meeting follows an alleged Chinese hack of American telecommunications networks that the US intelligence community is investigating. US officials believe a Chinese hacking group that Microsoft Corp. dubbed Salt Typhoon may have been inside US telecoms for months and found a route into an access point for court-authorized wiretapping.</p>

<p>The sweeping hack targeted the Trump campaign as well as that of Vice President Kamala Harris, his Democratic general-election rival.</p>

<p>Sullivan on Sunday called it "an absolutely significant attack" in an interview on CBS's Face the Nation and said that Biden brings up cyber-enabled espionage every time he speaks with Xi.</p>

<p>"It's something that the FBI, our Department of Homeland Security, our entire national security enterprise is digging into in a big way," he said. "And of course, it will be on the agenda between every American official and every Chinese official in the weeks ahead."</p>

<p>A senior administration official said Biden would warn Xi about what they cast as reckless attacks against critical US networks and that such actions would only lead to further decoupling from Chinese-origin technology.</p>

<p>The two superpowers continue to spar over issues ranging from Taiwan to Ukraine to the South China Sea. The Biden administration has also imposed technology restrictions and a ban on Chinese electric vehicles, as well as added more tariffs to the existing ones they inherited from the first Trump term.</p>

<p>The Biden team often touts its efforts to keep open channels of communication, including via Sullivan and his counterpart Wang Yi, that have helped steady ties.</p>

<p>The US official had one piece of unsolicited advice: Whatever the next administration decides to do, they will need to find ways to manage the relationship somehow.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The father of a 10-year-old British-Pakistani girl on Wednesday admitted that he killed his daughter but maintained he had not meant to harm her, even as he beat her when she lay dying.</p>

<p>Sara Sharif was found dead in her bed in Woking, southwest of London, on August 10, 2023, with extensive injuries including broken bones, burns and bite marks.</p>

<p>Her father, Urfan Sharif, 42, had fled to Pakistan a day before her body was found, with his wife Beinash Batool, 30, and the girl's uncle, Faisal Malik, 29.</p>

<p>All three adults deny murder and a separate charge of allowing the death of a child.</p>

<p>Giving evidence at the Old Bailey court in central London, Urfan Sharif had previously blamed Batool, Sara's stepmother, and said she had forced him to confess to killing her.</p>

<p>But under questioning from his wife's lawyer on Wednesday the taxi driver said he took "full responsibility" for what had happened, but that he had not intended to hurt Sara.</p>

<p>Asked if he killed Sara by beating, he replied: "Yes, she died because of me."</p>

<p>He also admitted causing multiple fractures in the weeks before Sara's death, using a cricket bat on her as she was bound with packaging tape, throttling her with his bare hands and breaking the hyoid bone in her neck.</p>

<p>"I can take full responsibility. I accept every single thing," he said, also accepting that he badly beat Sara on August 8 when she had collapsed and was dying.</p>

<p>He maintained however that he was not guilty of the murder charge. "I did not want to hurt her. I didn't want to harm her," he told the jury.</p>

<p>Sara's body was discovered in her bed on August 10. Her father phoned British police after arriving in Islamabad and said he had beaten his daughter "too much".</p>

<p>A written confession was found beside her. A post-mortem examination found she had suffered multiple injuries, including at least 25 broken bones.</p>

<p>She also had burns and human bite marks on her body but Urfan Sharif denied making them.</p>

<p>The defendants were arrested on September 13 when they flew back to the UK.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A source said that the government is allegedly trying to accuse Polymarket of market manipulation and rigging its polls in favour of Trump.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation on Wednesday raided the New York City apartment of Shayne Coplan, the 26-year-old founder of the crypto-fueled election gambling website Polymarket. During the raid, agents woke up Mr Coplan at 6 am and&nbsp;seized his phone and other electronic devices&nbsp;without providing a clear explanation. The raid came after Polymarket accurately predicted an easy Trump triumph over Vice President Kamala Harris, as opposed to traditional polls. A source told the <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/13/business/fbi-seizes-polymarket-ceos-phone-electronics-after-betting-platform-predicts-trump-win-source/">New York Post</a></em> that the government is allegedly trying to accuse Polymarket of market manipulation and rigging its polls in favour of Trump.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"It's grand political theatre at its worst. They could have asked his lawyer for any of these things. Instead, they staged a so-called raid so they can leak it to the media and use it for obvious political reasons," the source told<em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/13/business/fbi-seizes-polymarket-ceos-phone-electronics-after-betting-platform-predicts-trump-win-source/"> The Post.&nbsp;</a></em></p>

<p>A Polymarket spokesperson said the FBI raid was "obvious political retribution by the outgoing administration against Polymarket for providing a market that correctly called the 2024 presidential election."</p>

<p>On X,&nbsp;Polymarket CEO also addressed the matter and wrote, ''It's discouraging that the current administration would seek a last-ditch effort to go after companies they deem to be associated with political opponents. We are deeply committed to being non-partisan, and today is no different, but the incumbents should do some self-reflecting and recognize that taking a more pro-business, pro-startup approach may be what would have changed their fate this election.''</p>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Notably, Polymarket made headlines in the lead-up to the presidential election for its bold prediction.&nbsp;Although it doesn't allow trading in the US, some users have found ways to bypass this restriction using VPNs.&nbsp;Before the election, Polymarket's odds heavily favoured Trump, giving him a 58% chance of winning, which later surged to 95% as the night progressed.&nbsp;The site also gained scrutiny after a mystery French trader, known as the polymarket whale, made large bets on Trump winning the election.</p>

<p>The FBI's investigation comes a week after Mr Coplan said Polymarket is planning to return to the US.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Polymarket's links To Trump and his allies</strong></p>

<p>Polymarket has strong ties to Donald Trump and his allies. The platform received $70 million in funding from billionaire Trump supporter Peter Thiel, as reported by Forbes earlier this year. What's more, Polymarket CEO Shayne Coplan has also been spotted getting cosy with <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://x.com/nicoleperlroth/status/1848198473625326069">Donald Trump Jr.</a></p>

<p>In 2022, the platform was forced to halt US trading and cough up $1.4 million to settle charges with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission for failing to register with the agency.&nbsp;Since then, the platform has only been available for bettors in other countries.</p>

<p><strong>Wash-trading allegations</strong></p>

<p>Just a week before the election, a <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://fortune.com/crypto/2024/10/30/polymarket-trump-election-crypto-wash-trading-researchers/" rel="nofollow, noindex">Fortune</a></em> report noted that analysts from two crypto research firms uncovered widespread evidence of wash-trading on Polymarket. Wash trading is an illegal form of market manipulation where a trader buys and sells the same asset to create a false impression of market activity.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Polymarket's Terms of Use expressly prohibit market manipulation. We strive to provide users with the fairest analysis possible and our transparency allows the market to decide," a Polymarket spokesperson told Fortune in a statement.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Four people who allegedly dressed as bears and damaged their own luxury cars in a bid to defraud insurance companies were arrested in the US state of California on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Suspicions were aroused when a claim was made for ripped seats and damaged doors on a luxury Rolls-Royce Ghost, an exclusive vehicle worth hundreds of thousands of dollars.</p>

<p>Claimants said a bear had got into the car when it was parked in Lake Arrowhead, a mountain spot outside Los Angeles, wreaking havoc on its interior.</p>

<p>To back up their claim, they provided photos of the damage as well as footage from a security camera, which they said showed the animal inside the vehicle.</p>

<p>But the company smelled a rat and contacted insurance fraud detectives.</p>

<p>"Upon further scrutiny of the video, the investigation determined the bear was actually a person in a bear costume," said a release from the California Department of Insurance.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Investigators then combed through records and found two other claims against different insurance companies alleging bear damage to different vehicles -- a 2015 Mercedes G63 AMG and a 2022 Mercedes E350 -- at the same spot.</p>

<p>Both claims had also been accompanied by video footage of the same "bear" rampaging around the vehicles.</p>

<p>"To further ensure it was not actually a bear in the video, the Department had a biologist from the California Department of Fish and Wildlife review the three alleged bear videos and they also opined it was clearly a human in a bear suit," Wednesday's statement said.</p>

<p>"After executing a search warrant, detectives found the bear costume in the suspects' home."</p>

<p>Ruben Tamrazian, 26, Ararat Chirkinian, 39, Vahe Muradkhanyan, 32, and Alfiya Zuckerman, 39, have all been charged with insurance fraud and conspiracy over the claims, which were worth over $140,000.</p>

<p>Black bears, which are native to California, occasionally do get inside vehicles in the hunt for food, and can cause tremendous damage.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 10-year-old autistic boy from California who was slapped by an irate Mercedes driver a few months ago received the surprise of his life recently when he was given an SUV. The incident, which occurred in July 2024, was caught on camera and went viral, causing massive outrage.</p>

<p>In the footage, Alfredo Morales was seen seated on a bus bench alongside his older sister when a visibly angry man, identified as Scott Sakajian, slapped him in the face. The incident reportedly occurred after Alfredo touched the emblem on the hood of Sakajian's $1,46,000 Mercedes-Benz sedan. The incident led to Sakajian being charged with child cruelty and battery.</p>

<p>Alfredo's family, who had been living out of a heavily worn 2010 Ford F-150 due to financial hardship, soon became the focus of local support. On November 11, 2024, when they took their vehicle to Airport Marina Ford in Los Angeles for repair, the dealership surprised them with a brand-new 2023 Ford Explorer, worth around $36,000.</p>

<p>“If there's a child involved in a situation like that, and the condition of living in the other vehicle, and trying to survive out of that, and then that vehicle being as bad as it was, it was just the right thing to do,” Dan Theroux, the general manager at Airport Marina Ford, was quoted as saying by<a href="https://abc7.com/post/family-boy-autism-was-slapped-man-viral-video-surprised-new-suv-la-ford-dealership/15528744/"> ABC 7.</a> He explained that the Morales' old truck required costly replacements, including a new transmission and engine. The new SUV comes with a Gold Certified warranty, allowing the family to visit any Ford dealership for future maintenance.</p>

<p>Jamie Bishton, president of NOARUS Auto Group, shared that after inspecting the old truck on its arrival, they quickly recognised it needed more than just a few repairs. “Dan got the Ford to come into the dealership. We saw it on the flatbed and we were like, ‘Uh oh, this needs more than just a repair,'” Bishton said.</p>

<p>Since the incident, support has come from various quarters, including a GoFundMe campaign launched to help the family. The fundraiser's page states, “Alfredo was the victim of a grown man slapping him at the bus stop. He has severe Autism and his family is in desperate need of help. Any help would be greatly appreciated by them. They are currently homeless and any help will hopefully help them get into some housing.” At the time of writing, the campaign had raised $98,285, far surpassing its initial $10,000 target.</p>

<p>Reflecting on the community's kindness, Alfredo's father, Miguel Morales, expressed his gratitude, saying, “Amazing. I don't have words to say… just say thanks. You know, thank God.”</p>

<p>The Morales family also hopes to eventually reopen their restaurant, which was closed in August 2023.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Umbria's Castle of Antognolla will soon transform into a Six Senses luxury resort.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Umbria, known as the Green Heart of Italy, is popular for its medieval cities, rolling hills, rich cultural legacy and delicious food. While the region is right next to Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna, it has mostly remained anonymous. But the nation's best-kept secret won't remain that way for long, as Umbria's Castle of Antognolla is now transforming into a Six Senses luxury resort, reported <a class="sp_lnk2" href="http://edition.cnn.com/travel/antognolla-castle-italy-six-senses-resort-spc/index.html" rel="nofollow,noindex">CNN</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Six Senses Antognolla will feature an initial 71-key hotel (16 suites of which will be located in the original castle), a 3,000-square-meter wellness centre and 17 custom residences. Spread across a network of vineyards, olive groves, and numerous cypress trees, the resort is scheduled to open in late 2026.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The accommodations will provide a panoramic view of the site's crown jewel, an 18-hole golf course that aims to challenge the dominance of Spanish and Portuguese golf hotspots on the continent.</p>

<p>Previously the burial site of Saint Herculanus, patron saint of the Umbrian capital of Perugia, the castle was embroiled in a long power struggle between several aristocratic families in one of the few landlocked regions of Italy. Pope Boniface IX granted the fortress to Ruggero di Antognolla in 1399, but the Baglioni family took control of it before the Antognollas brutally reclaimed it in the early 16th century.</p>

<p>Nobleman Cornelio Oddi purchased the estate in 1628 intending to turn it into a holiday destination. Even if ownership has moved multiple times since then, recent events indicate that Oddi's goals will live on.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 60-year-old American tourist was found dead in the bathroom of Ballyfin Demesne, a luxury hotel in Ireland known for its celebrity guests. The man, whose name has not been publicly released, appeared to have been the victim of a violent assault. According to the Garda Siochana, Ireland's national police and security service, the US citizen was discovered unconscious on the bathroom floor Tuesday evening. Despite efforts, he was pronounced dead at the scene. Irish police have arrested a suspect, also an American in his 30s, who reportedly travelled with the victim.&nbsp;He is currently detained under Section 4 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984 at a Garda station in the Eastern Region, <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/11/13/death-ireland-hotel-american/76266467007/">USA Today</a></em> reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.irishtimes.com/crime-law/2024/11/13/ballyfin-demense-hotel-death-man-arrested-after-fatal-assault-at-laois-hotel/">The Irish Times</a></em>, the man had arrived from the US just hours before the tragedy. The post-mortem is underway to establish further details on the incident. Meanwhile, the victim's family have been notified, and a liaison officer has been assigned to support them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Gardai are investigating "all the circumstances surrounding the death of a man at a hotel in north County Laois on Tuesday evening,” a spokesperson confirmed.</p>

<p>As the investigation continues, a section of the hotel has been cordoned off to facilitate a thorough examination of the incident.</p>

<p>According to <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://metro.co.uk/2024/11/13/man-found-dead-after-assault-bathroom-floor-worlds-best-hotel-21986539/">Metro</a></em>, Ballyfin Demesne, a luxurious Irish retreat priced between 600 -2,500&nbsp;Euros per night has long been a haven for A-list celebrities since it opened its doors in 2011. Notably, it hosted Kim Kardashian and Kanye West for their five-day honeymoon in 2014, after they were declined accommodation at Glin Castle. The hotel has also hosted George Clooney and his wife Amal.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This esteemed hotel has garnered several prestigious accolades, including Top Resort Hotel in Ireland and UK 2024 by Travel + Leisure magazine.&nbsp;In 2016 it&nbsp;was voted the world's number one hotel&nbsp;according to over 300,000 readers of the influential New York travel magazine.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Jill Biden reached out to Melania Trump after an assassination attempt on her husband Donald Trump in Pennsylvania's Butler City on July 13 this year.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jill Biden reached out to Melania Trump after an assassination attempt on her husband Donald Trump in Pennsylvania's Butler City on July 13 this year. But Melania doubted whether Jill Biden's concern was genuine because the first lady had called her husband "liar" and "evil" a few days before the call, <a href="http://https://nypost.com/2024/11/13/us-news/melania-trump-takes-swipe-at-jill-bidens-call-after-assassination-attempt/">New York Post</a> reported.</p>

<p>"I do question, however, whether Jill's concern was genuine, as a few days prior she referred to my husband as ‘evil' and a ‘liar'," <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/melania-trump-to-skip-white-house-meeting-with-jill-biden-report-6998039">Melania Trump</a> said in an interview with French news outlet Paris Match before the November 5 presidential election in the US.</p>

<p>She added, "It was obvious that the onslaught of rhetoric from Democrat leaders and the mainstream media was so deeply embedded in our nation's consciousness it prompted an attempt to assassinate Donald."</p>

<p>Last week, Donald Trump secured another term in the White House, defeating his Democrat rival Kamala Harris. Not just Jill Biden, even the US President spoke to Donald Trump after the July 13 incident when a bullet grazed his right ear.</p>

<p>During the campaign, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/melania-trump-may-not-return-to-white-house-full-time-as-first-lady-heres-why-7012963">Melania remained</a> away from the limelight and made public appearances towards the end of the election cycle following the release of a tell-all memoir.</p>

<p>One of her famous appearances during her husband's third White House bid was at the Madison Square Garden rally, held a few days before the election.</p>

<p>She even opted out of the traditional tea between first ladies during the transition on Wednesday, while Donald Trump sat down with Joe Biden.</p>

<p>In a statement, Melania's team said she won't be attending the meeting while adding that her husband's return to the "Oval Office to commence the transition process is encouraging, and she wishes him great success”.</p>

<p>Sources told the New York Post that one of the major reasons behind skipping the tea with Jill Biden was the 2022 FBI raid on Mar-a-Lago.</p>

<p>However, Melania has rubbished the rumours that she won't be moving back into the White House with Donald Trump full-time in January 2025.</p>

<p>In the statement, her office stressed that several unnamed sources "continue to provide false, misleading, and inaccurate information."</p>

<p>After her husband's victory in 2016, Melania Trump met former first lady Michelle Obama for tea in the Yellow Room. However, she did not extend the same courtesy to Jill Biden after Joe Biden defeated Donald Trump in 2020.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Mr Jois' yoga centre, Sarath Yoga Centre, also confirmed the news of his demise."It is with profound sadness that we share with you the news of the sudden passing of our beloved guru, Shri Sharath Jois. He passed away on Nov 11, 2024 in Virginia, US (US time)," the yoga centre wrote in a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://sharathyogacentre.com/">statement</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"His family is in the US currently to bring his mortal remains back to his hometown, Mysore. This is an extremely difficult time for his family and students. At this time of bereavement, we request everyone to respect Sharathji's family and not spread or circulate any unverified information regarding his passing," the statement added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/12/us/sharath-jois-dead-ashtanga.html" rel="noindex,nofollow"><em>New York Times</em></a>, Mr Jois had been on a teaching tour across the US and was scheduled to conduct classes in San Antonio, Texas, later in November. His workshops, in India and worldwide, were attended by thousands of disciples seeking a direct experience with the leader of Ashtanga yoga.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mr Jois learnt the art form from his grandfather Krishna Pattabhi Jois, a legendary yoga master who had a global following that included celebrities like Gwyneth Paltrow and Madonna. While K Pattabhi Jois is credited with pushing Ashtanga yoga to mainstream popularity, Mr Jois is known for memorialising his legacy following his grandfather's death in 2009.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On the day of his death, Mr Jois had taught a low-intensity version of Ashtanga yoga that he had recently developed, called the "Active Series," to instructors from around the world at a seminar at the University of Virginia. That afternoon, he went on a hike with around 50 students. Appearing fatigued, Mr Jois was trailing the group when he sat on a bench about a third of a mile into the trail, and later fell off it, John Bultman, the yoga program manager at the University of Virginia, told the <em>New York Times</em>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Students' attempts to revive him using CPR failed, and he was pronounced dead moments after emergency medical workers arrived.</p>

<p>Sharath Jois was born Rangaswamy Sharath on September 29, 1971, in Mysore. Besides his sister, he is survived by his mother, Saraswathi Jois, father Rangaswamy, wife Shruti Jois, and two children, son Sambhav Jois and daughter Shraddha Jois.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As world leaders meet at the 2024 UN climate conference (COP29) in Azerbaijan, a new report by an international development agency on Thursday said people living in 10 most climate-vulnerable countries received less than $1 a year in climate finance.</p>

<p>It warned world leaders must stop “chasing shadows” with attempts to make up for insufficient and poor-quality public finance with private contributions. The New Collective Quantified Goal (NCQG), the framework for mobilising finance to accelerate climate action in lower-income countries, is due to dominate the discussions amongst world leaders, earning COP29 its “Finance COP” title.</p>

<p>World leaders will be expected to replace the previous target agreed in Copenhagen in 2009 of $100 billion per year by 2020, which developed countries only met late in the form of loans rather than grants.</p>

<p>Christian Aid says a new approach is needed to “rebuild trust and credibility.”</p>

<p>The charity's new report, ‘Putting our money where our mouth is: why we need public climate finance', concludes the assumption that the new finance goal will effectively be met by private finance is at odds with the evidence.</p>

<p>According to the report, much lower amounts of private climate finance flowed between countries than were hoped or expected.</p>

<p>Under three per cent of all climate finance (international and domestic) went to low-income countries in 2022, the latest year for which data is available.</p>

<p>The data also shows the 10 countries most affected by climate change between 2000 and 2019 received just $23bn, less than two per cent of all climate finance, despite accounting for nine per cent of the world's population.</p>

<p>The 750 million people now living in these climate-vulnerable countries would have received on average less than $1 each a year from rich countries.</p>

<p>Christian Aid is urging richer countries to pay their fair share of public, grant based climate finance to developing countries through progressive international taxes on major polluters, not least fossil fuel companies.</p>

<p>Mariana Paoli, Global Advocacy Lead at Christian Aid, said: “The climate crisis is disproportionately affecting the world's poorest and most vulnerable communities, who contribute the least to its causes. These communities bear the brunt of climate-related disasters despite having by far the least capacity to adapt.</p>

<p>“If COP29 is going to live up to its ‘Finance COP' title, world leaders must stop chasing shadows with attempts to make up for insufficient and poor-quality public finance with private contributions. We cannot continue the failures of the past; we must rebuild trust and credibility.</p>

<p>“The evidence is clear. Private finance, predicated on profit, doesn't reach poorer and climate vulnerable communities. Just 0.5 per cent private finance goes to adaptation, a drop in the ocean. When $270 bn is spent on fossil fuel subsidies, seven times what is spent on adaptation, it's a cruel joke.</p>

<p>“To meet the scale of the climate finance needed, and to avoid exacerbating the debt-crisis, we need more public finance through grants. Christian Aid is therefore calling for more progressive taxes on major polluters, not least fossil fuel companies. It can be done but it requires the political will.”</p>

<p>Janine Felson, Ambassador of Belize to the United Nations, added: “The climate injustices are glaring. Belize and other vulnerable nations face outsized climate impacts with limited support, despite contributing minimally to the crisis. Who should bear the cost? Both law and ethics demand that polluters, not victims, pay. Yet Belize's experience shows that climate-vulnerable nations are left to shoulder the costs. At the upcoming summit in Baku, leaders must address this injustice.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Days after Donald Trump announced that Vivek Ramaswamy would join his government alongside tech mogul Elon Musk, an old video of the biotech entrepreneur's high school graduation speech is going viral. The video features a young Ramaswamy, then an 18-year-old student at St Xavier High School, delivering a commencement address.</p>

<p><strong>READ </strong>|&nbsp;<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/who-is-vivek-ramaswamy-the-biotech-billionaire-now-part-of-donald-trump-s-new-government-initiative-7010367">Who Is Vivek Ramaswamy, The Biotech Entrepreneur Now Part Of Trump 2.0</a></p>

<p>In the video, Ramaswamy reflects on his journey through high school, saying, “I have been racing my entire high school career, but now, when we are finally crossing the finish line, I wish I could have stopped, just a little earlier, and catch a breath of the fresh air that has surrounded me the whole time.” His words have resonated deeply with viewers, who admire his introspective and forward-looking mindset.</p>

<p>He then goes on to welcome everyone, saying, “Teachers, staff, classmates, counsellors and friends, I'd like to welcome you to the 2003 Saint X graduation ceremony.”<br />
<br />
Drawing on literary references from his English class, Ramaswamy explores the duality of graduating. "It is better to travel than it is to arrive," he quotes, admitting to having mixed feelings about the moment. “How am I supposed to feel right now?” he asks, capturing the uncertainty and excitement of an impending future.</p>

<p>Ramaswamy also reflected on the word “commencement,” saying it comes from the French word “commencer,” meaning “to begin.” Yet, he pointed out it was used here to mark the end of their four-year high school experience. “So, what is it really?” he asks. “The climactic ending to it all, or the launch pad from which we now embark.”</p>

<p>Ramaswamy also reflected on what the “Class of 2003” might truly signify 18 years down the road for all of them. While they may remember achievements — like the record number of National Merit finalists, their cross-country and football victories, or their swim team's 25th state championship — he said these accomplishments may not be what would resonate most in the future. For Ramaswamy personally, memories of navigating St Xavier as a non-Catholic Hindu were likely to stand out. He recalled feeling out of place as a freshman at the Mass of the Holy Spirit, awkwardly trying to follow rituals he didn't understand. But over time, these experiences helped him discover a unique, personal faith —neither strictly Catholic nor Hindu, but his own. It's this journey of self-discovery, he said, that would likely be the lasting essence of their class.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A man with explosives died Wednesday trying to enter Brazil's Supreme Court in what appeared to be a suicide, officials said, days before the country hosts the G20 summit.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"This citizen approached the Federal Supreme Court, tried to enter, failed, and the explosion happened at the entrance," Brasilia governor Celina Leao told reporters, adding that no one else was hurt.</p>

<p>The man's body was located outside the court after two explosions occurred, but suspicious objects around it prevented immediate efforts to carry out identification, she said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The first blast came from a car in the square outside the court around 7:30 pm (2230 GMT). The second one happened a few seconds later when the man tried to enter the court, and this blast killed him, the governor said.</p>

<p>The incident came ahead of a G20 summit next Monday and Tuesday in Rio de Janeiro that will gather leaders from around the world. Among them will be US President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping.</p>

<p>After that summit, Xi is scheduled to stay on, going to Brasilia for a state visit next Wednesday.</p>

<p>The convergence of the G20 leaders on Brazil has been accompanied by heightened security arrangements in the country, particularly in Rio.</p>

<p>Judges evacuated</p>

<p>The Supreme Court said in a statement that two loud explosions rang out at the end of Wednesday's session and that the judges were safely evacuated.</p>

<p>The court is located in the Praca dos Tres Poderes, which also fronts onto the presidential palace and the Congress.&nbsp;</p>

<p>President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva was not in the palace at the time of the explosions, a spokesman said.</p>

<p>The presidential palace was sealed off and a large police contingent deployed around the plaza.&nbsp;</p>

<p>An AFP photographer in the area said the zone was locked down as heavy rain fell.</p>

<p>Federal police said they had opened an investigation to determine the circumstances of the blasts and any possible motive.</p>

<p>Police who had been patrolling the area noticed the car on fire and saw the man leaving the vehicle, said Sergeant Rodrigo Santos of the capital's military police.</p>

<p>A government employee in the capital, Laiana Costa, told local media said she saw the man go by and "then there was a noise, and I looked back and there was fire and smoke coming out," and security guards from the court rushing up.</p>

<p>The same area was the scene of high drama last year.</p>

<p>On January 8, 2023, the seats of power in Brasilia were hit by an insurrection a week after President Lula defeated the right-wing incumbent president Jair Bolsonaro at the polls.</p>

<p>Thousands of Bolsonaro supporters angry over his defeat stormed the government buildings, causing major damage before authorities managed to reimpose control.</p>

<p>The head of Brazil's Senate, Rodrigo Pacheco, said that rioting prompted "a change in security rules" for the presidential palace, Congress and Supreme Court.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A mysterious necklace laden with some 500 diamonds and with possible links to a scandal that contributed to the downfall of Marie Antoinette, sold for $4.8 million at an auction in Geneva Wednesday.</p>

<p>The 18th century jewel containing around 300 carats of diamonds had been estimated to go under the hammer at the Sotheby's Royal and Noble Jewels sale for $1.8-2.8 million.</p>

<p>But after energetic bidding, the hammer price ticked in at 3.55 million Swiss francs ($4 million), and Sotheby's listed the final price after taxes and commissions at 4.26 million francs ($4.81 million).</p>

<p>Some of the diamonds are believed to stem from a piece at the centre of the "Diamond Necklace Affair" -- a scandal in the 1780s that further tarnished the reputation of France's last queen, Marie Antoinette, and boosted support for the coming French Revolution.</p>

<p>The auction house hailed that the necklace, composed of three rows of diamonds finished with a diamond tassel at each end, had emerged "miraculously intact" from a private Asian collection to make its first public appearance in 50 years.</p>

<p>"This spectacular antique jewel is an incredible survivor of history," it said in a statement prior to the sale.</p>

<p>Describing the massive Georgian-era piece as "rare and highly important", Sotheby's said it had likely been created in the decade preceding the French Revolution.</p>

<p>"The jewel has passed from families to families. We can start at the early 20th century when it was part of the collection of the Marquesses of Anglesey," Andres White Correal, chairman of the Sotheby's jewelry department, told AFP when the necklace went on display in London in September.</p>

<p>Members of this aristocratic family are believed to have worn the necklace twice in public: once at the 1937 coronation of King George VI and once at his daughter Queen Elizabeth II's coronation in 1953.</p>

<p>Beyond that, little is known of the necklace, including who designed it and for whom it was commissioned, although the auction house believes that such an impressive antique jewel could only have been created for a royal family.</p>

<p>Sotheby's said it was likely that some of the diamonds featured in the piece came from the famous necklace from the scandal that engulfed Marie Antoinette just a few years before she was guillotined.</p>

<p>That scandal involved a hard-up nobel woman named Jeanne de la Motte who pretended to be a confidante of the queen, and managed to acquire a lavish diamond-studded necklace in her name, against a promise of a later payment.</p>

<p>While the queen was later found to be blameless in the affair, the scandal still deepened the perception of her careless extravagance, adding to the anger that would unleash the revolution.</p>

<p>Sotheby's said the diamonds in the necklace sold Wednesday were likely sourced from "the legendary Golconda mines in India" -- considered to produce the purest and most</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Russian television chef, who was an outspoken critic of President Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine, has been found dead in Serbia, the <em>BBC </em>reported. Alexei Zimin, 52, was considered a household name in Russia before he left the country after criticising the Kremlin's annexation of Crimea in 2014. He set up his new home and businesses in London but remained the host of a popular cookery show on Russian broadcaster NTV. However, the show was axed after he posted an anti-war message on social media following the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mr Zimin was found dead in a hotel room in Belgrade, the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7049jn5kd3o" rel="noindex,nofollow"><em>BBC </em></a>reported citing Russian media. He had travelled to the Serbian capital to promote his new book about Britain Anglomania.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Serbian authorities have said that there were "no suspicious circumstances" related to Mr Zimin's death and that an autopsy and toxicology report was ongoing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Katerina Ternovskaya, co-owner of the restaurant where the 52-year-old had presented his book, said people were "in shock" adding that "the last time we have seen him, he was smiling and in a great mood". "The dinner was wonderful and Alexei was very happy," she said.</p>

<p>Mr Zimin's restaurant in the UK also confirmed the chef's death on Instagram. "To us, Alexei was not only a colleague but also a friend, a close companion with whom we shared many experiences - good, kind, and at times sorrowful," the restaurant said. "We are profoundly grateful for the kind words we have received today in Alexei's memory. We share this painful loss with you. The entire ZIMA team extends our heartfelt condolences to Alexei's family and mourns alongside them," it added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Notably, Mr Zimin was a prominent critic of Russia's war in Ukraine. After he posted a video on social media of him singing an anti-war song, his Russian TV show 'Cooking with Alexei Zimin' was abruptly cancelled by the network NTV.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At the beginning of the war in 2022, the chef also wrote several anti-war statements on Instagram saying, "bring our soldiers home" and "The idea is unoriginal. Stop the war. Withdraw troops and bring our soldiers home".&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Like everyone who grew up in the USSR, I was brought up with the fairly common sense belief that war is the worst thing that can happen. There is no excuse for it and even if there were, now it's too late to make excuses. As Rosenbaum sang. Gotta stop this madness and 'War is not poker'" he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Since moving to the UK, Mr Zimin reportedly had not been back to Russia. He previously said that he and his restaurant Zima in central London, which has donated money to Ukrainian refugees, had been the target of threats.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Allan Lichtman, often dubbed the "Nostradamus" of US Presidential Polls, is blaming the "explosion" of disinformation and billionaire Elon Musk for his incorrect prediction that Kamala Harris would win the 2024 election. Mr Lichtman, a professor at American University, is renowned for accurately forecasting nine of the last ten US elections. However, last week, the historian and political scientist took a loss on his remarkable record by predicting that Vice President Kamala Harris would win the 2024 presidential race. Now, speaking to <em>News Nation</em>, Mr Lichtman provided a deeper explanation for his incorrect forecast and pointed to conservative media platforms and Elon Musk, who pored millions into Donald Trump's campaign, as a factor in his inaccurate prediction.</p>

<p>"Number one, disinformation. We've always had disinformation, but disinformation has exploded to an unprecedented degree. You talked about a grievance election, but a lot of that grievance was driven by disinformation," Mr Lichtman told the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWGzHXLTFHw">outlet</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The political scientist continued by naming X (formerly Twitter) owner Elon Musk, who appeared at some of Donald Trump's campaign rallies and became one of the loudest media cheerleaders. He claimed that Mr Musk's microblogging platform was used to spread misinformation about issues like immigration, hurricane relief and the war in Ukraine.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We've seen something brand new this time - billionaire Elon Musk putting his thumb on the scales," Mr Lichtman said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"It's been reported that his misinformation had had billions, literally billions of views and this has spread to every aspect of this election," he added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mr Lichtman's method for forecasting the presidential election results was based on a historical index model he dubs the "Keys to the White House". This unique system analyses the political landscape through the lens of 13 true-false statements focused on the incumbent president's party. If six or more of the statements are false, then the challenger is predicted to win.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the interview with <em>News Nation</em>, the academic acknowledged that his method "maybe" needs to be changed in light of last week's events. "The premise of the keys is that a rational, pragmatic electorate decides whether the White House party has governed well enough to get four more years. But if the views of the White House party are controlled by disinformation, particularly driven by those who are so rich that they have extraordinary influence beyond anyone else, then maybe the premise of the keys need to be changed," Mr Lichtman said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Notably, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/moment-nostradamus-of-us-elections-realised-donald-trump-would-win-6961747">Allan Lichtman</a> has been forecasting the results of US presidential elections since 1984. He has accurately predicted the last nine out of 10 presidential races. Previously, he even forecasted that Mr Trump would be impeached during his presidency - which he was, twice.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sri Lanka votes Thursday in a second national election in as many months with a deeply divided opposition struggling to recover from a crushing defeat at presidential polls.</p>

<p>The snap parliamentary election was called by the new President Anura Kumara Dissanayake -- the South Asian island's first leftist leader -- after he won polls on a promise to combat graft and recover the country's stolen assets.</p>

<p>Dissanayake's party is widely tipped to sweep Thursday's parliamentary vote with analysts saying the opposition is in disarray.</p>

<p>The 55-year-old leader is seeking a two-thirds majority in the 225-member legislature to press ahead with reforms after the country's economic meltdown in 2022, when then president Gotabaya Rajapaksa was ousted.</p>

<p>Polls for 17.1 million voters choosing between 8,800 candidates, open at 7:00 am (0130 GMT) on Thursday and close at 4:00 pm, with initial results expected Friday.</p>

<p>Dissanayake's JVP, or the People's Liberation Front, is the main constituent of the National People's Power (NPP) coalition of professionals seeking to form the next government.</p>

<p>The NPP held just three seats in the outgoing assembly.</p>

<p>Dissanayake had been an MP for nearly 25 years and was briefly an agriculture minister, but he distanced himself from traditional politicians accused of leading the country to its worst economic crisis two years ago.</p>

<p>His JVP party led two insurrections in 1971 and 1987, leading to the loss of at least 80,000 lives, but Dissanayake took power peacefully in elections on September 21.</p>

<p>'Foregone conclusion'</p>

<p>Despite previous promises to renegotiate a controversial $2.9 billion International Monetary Fund (IMF) bailout secured by his predecessor Ranil Wickremesinghe, Dissanayake has chosen to maintain the agreement with the international lender.</p>

<p>The country's main private sector lobby, the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce, is tacitly supporting Dissanayake and expects him to press ahead with reforms.</p>

<p>"Continuing reforms... could encourage both investor confidence and fiscal discipline, setting a foundation for sustainable growth," CCC Secretary Bhuwanekabahu Perera told AFP ahead of voting.</p>

<p>He said Dissanayake's approach to governance "may lean toward a balanced socialist-democratic model that acknowledges market realities."</p>

<p>An IMF delegation is due in Colombo on Thursday to review economic progress before releasing the next tranche of $330 million of the bailout loan.</p>

<p>Opposition leader Sajith Premadasa, who had campaigned to take part in a coalition government, vowed in his final campaign rally he would "put pressure" on Dissanayake to honour promises of tax cuts.</p>

<p>Poll monitors and analysts note that Thursday's election had failed to generate the level of enthusiasm -- or violence -- seen at previous polls.</p>

<p>Political analyst Kusal Perera said there was little campaigning by opposition parties.</p>

<p>"The opposition is dead," Perera said. "The result of the election is a foregone conclusion."</p>

<p>Over 60 senior politicians from the previous administration have opted to stay out.</p>

<p>The outgoing parliament was dominated by the party of former president Mahinda Rajapaksa -- the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), or the People's Front -- but it has since splintered.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Rajapaksa is not contesting, but his son Namal, a former sports minister, is seeking re-election.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

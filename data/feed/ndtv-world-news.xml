       <description><![CDATA[Both Bradley, 22, and Antonia, 20, pleaded guilty this week to a charge of outraging public decency by committing a sexual act in a public place.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A British couple recently had their court hearing after being kicked off from an EasyJet flight in March for a lewd act. Bradley Smith and Antonia Sullivan were caught in the act while engaging in a sexual act in public view, leading to their escort of the flight.</p>

<p>The couple was returning to Bristol from a holiday in Tenerife, Spain, on March 3 when multiple witnesses reported their inappropriate behaviour to the crew. During the 7 a.m. flight, Bradley sat in seat 16A while Antonia occupied 16B.</p>

<p>According to reports from British newspaper <em>The Sun</em>, a fellow passenger in seat 16C was among three witnesses to their NSFW act, along with a mother and daughter sitting in the row behind them.</p>

<p>Witnesses stated that shortly after takeoff, Bradley asked Antonia to perform a sexual act. They then draped clothing over Bradley's lap and began their explicit actions on the crowded flight.</p>

<p>"After a few minutes, the witness noticed that the couple had rearranged some coats over Smith's lap, followed by vigorous hand movements beneath the coat," prosecutor Maree Doyle told Bristol magistrates' court.</p>

<p>"The witness next to them could see what was happening, as could a mother and teenage daughter seated behind the couple," the prosecutor added.</p>

<p>When the angry mother alerted the cabin crew, Antonia initially claimed she was merely rubbing her boyfriend's leg. However, the couple was eventually escorted off the plane by police for questioning.</p>

<p>Both Bradley, 22, and Antonia, 20, pleaded guilty this week to a charge of outraging public decency by committing a sexual act in a public place.</p>

<p>They were ordered to pay 100 pounds (approximately Rs 11,000) as compensation to each of the three witnesses. Additionally, Bradley was sentenced to complete 300 hours of community service, while Antonia received 270 hours.</p>

<p>Judge Lynne Matthews chastised the couple for their explicit behaviour in public, stating, "You showed no regard for the feelings of other passengers. There was a child sitting behind you who was able to see what was happening.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Who do you think you are, and what right do you believe you have to behave in such a way in full view of people on that flight?" the judge questioned.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two consecutive Russian attacks on a medical centre in Sumy in northeastern Ukraine on Saturday morning killed six people, Ukraine's interior minister said.</p>

<p>"The first attack killed 1 person and damaged the ceilings of several floors of the hospital. The evacuation of patients and staff began," Ihor Klymenko said on Telegram.</p>

<p>As people were being evacuated, the Russians struck again, killing a further five people, he said.</p>

<p>Attacks on Sumy city and the Sumy region have become much more frequent since Ukrainian forces launched an operation in Russia's neighbouring Kursk region in August and captured dozens of settlements.</p>

<p>Sumy city is located just 32 km (20 miles) from the Russian border and Russian forces have been attacking the region and the city with drones and guided bombs.</p>

<p>Klymenko did not specify what weapons were used in Saturday's attacks but the regional administration said the strike was carried out by drones.</p>

<p>Ukrainian air forces earlier on Saturday said its troops shot down 69 of 73 drones during an overnight Russian attack that included two ballistic and two cruise missiles.</p>

<p>About 15 Russian attack drones were destroyed by air defences on the outskirts and in the capital Kyiv, the military administration there said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Asia's strongest storm this year, Typhoon Yagi, caused damages estimated at 81.5 trillion dong ($3.31 billion) across northern Vietnam, or twice as much as previous estimates, state media said on Saturday.</p>

<p>The typhoon, which killed 299 with 34 missing, devastated export-oriented industrial hubs, destroying factories and facilities, besides flooding farmland, damaging homes, and tearing up a bridge.</p>

<p>"The total economic damage is initially estimated at over 81.5 trillion dong, with most damage triggered by landslides and flash floods," state-run Vietnam News Agency quoted Agriculture Minister Le Minh Hoan as saying.</p>

<p>The figure exceeds a preliminary estimate of $1.6 billion made this month by the planning ministry that threatened to chip 0.15 percentage point from a forecast for economic growth of 6.8% to 7% this year.</p>

<p>Hoan urged authorities to help people resume production while ensuring supplies and holding down prices, as farm and agricultural land were among the areas hit hardest.</p>

<p>Live pig prices in Vietnam have risen steadily since Typhoon Yagi and subsequent flooding affected several pig farms, Reuters has reported.</p>

<p>On Thursday, rating agency S&amp;P Global said Vietnamese banks' profitability would be hit because of typhoon debt relief measures ordered by the central bank.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris has vowed to impose tougher security measures at the border and fix America's broken immigration system]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris has vowed to impose tougher security measures at the border and fix America's broken immigration system, as she sought to counter frequent political attacks on the issue from her Republican rival Donald Trump ahead of the November election.</p>

<p>Vice President Harris' comments came during her visit to the US-Mexico border in Douglas, Arizona, on Friday.</p>

<p>Despite taking a hardline stance on border security, Harris said she also supports a "pathway to citizenship" for undocumented migrants currently in the US.</p>

<p>"As President, I will work with Congress to create, at long last, a pathway to citizenship for hardworking immigrants who have been here for years," Harris said.</p>

<p>Harris was in Arizona to get a first-hand assessment of the security situation at the southern borders.</p>

<p>Slamming former President Trump, she said politicians have refused to come together and fix the broken immigration system.</p>

<p>Illegal immigration is an issue that Americans have grown increasingly worried about in recent years amid record levels of migrant crossings at the southern border.</p>

<p>"Well, as President, I will put politics aside to fix our immigration system and find solutions to problems which have persisted for far too long...These issues are highly consequential for our nation," she said.</p>

<p>Harris, 59, will take on Trump, 78, in the November 5 presidential election.</p>

<p>Observing that the contrast in the 2024 election is clear, Harris said it is a choice between common sense solutions and the same old political games.</p>

<p>"In the four years that Donald Trump was President, he did nothing to fix our broken immigration system. He did not solve the shortage of immigration judges and border agents or create lawful pathways into our nation. He did nothing to address our outdated asylum system. And did not work with other governments in our hemisphere to deal with what is clearly a regional challenge," she alleged.</p>

<p>Harris slammed Trump for wanting to run on a problem instead of fix a problem.</p>

<p>"The American people deserve a President who cares more about border security than playing political games," she said.</p>

<p>As a former border state Attorney General, Harris noted that she understands what security and enforcing the law at the border means, prosecuting transnational criminal organizations for the trafficking of guns, drugs, and human beings.</p>

<p>As such she unveiled her approach to "target the entire global fentanyl supply chain" to "significantly reduce the flow of precursor chemicals from China" and protect Americans from the "unimaginable destruction" it is causing.</p>

<p>"On behalf of all communities across our nation that want to see these problems solved I say: We cannot accept Donald Trump's failure to lead. We should not permit scapegoating instead of solutions. Or rhetoric instead of results," she said.</p>

<p>In his remarks earlier in the day, Trump hammered Harris for having an unsecured border.</p>

<p>"This is bad timing for Kamala to show up today at the border. She didn't go there for four years. Today, she shows up," Trump said.</p>

<p>Trump said Harris had betrayed her oath.</p>

<p>"She let our cities fail violent gangs. She let our American sons and daughters be raped and murdered at the hands of vicious monsters. She let American communities be conquered. You go out to Aurora in Colorado, where they're taking over with AK-47s. They're taking over real estate. Kamala turned cherished small towns into blighted refugee camps," he said.</p>

<p>"What Kamala Harris has done is unforgivable. It's a crime what she did. It's got to be criminal. There's no greater act of disloyalty than to extinguish the sovereignty of your own nation, and that's what she's done. She's ruined our nation. She's ruined our nation," Trump alleged.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Oliver Bromley had just completed a treatment session at King's College Hospital in southeast London and decided to grab lunch at a nearby eatery.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A man with a facial disfigurement has spoken out about the moment he was asked to leave a London restaurant after staff claimed he was “scaring customers.”</p>

<p>Oliver Bromley, 42, had just completed a treatment session at King's College Hospital in southeast London and decided to grab lunch at a nearby eatery. However, after attempting to place his order, he was told to leave the place because patrons allegedly complained about his appearance, according to a report in The New York Post.<br />
<br />
Bromley, who has Neurofibromatosis Type 1, a genetic disorder causing benign tumours to grow on nerves, expressed shock at being asked to leave so abruptly.</p>

<p>“I hadn't even sat down,” he said, adding that when he went to place his order, he was asked to leave. A man behind the counter told him there were complaints about him, asking him to leave, Bromley said. "I asked him to repeat himself, and he said I was scaring customers," he added.<br />
<br />
Though upset by the encounter, Bromley hoped his experience would lead to increased awareness and education about his condition within the hospitality industry. “There's a lot of naivety around the issue,” he said, expressing a desire to help people better understand his condition.</p>

<p>Bromley said that there was nothing to be afraid of, adding, "It's just something some individuals have to live with".<br />
<br />
"I am hoping this raises awareness and that, going forward, there might be a positive outcome and prevent it happening again," The New York Post quoted him as saying.<br />
<br />
Bromley also reached out to the restaurant, which he chose not to name, but said he received no response. Then he reported the matter to the Metropolitan Police, who classified the incident as a hate crime. The Met told BBC that officers had visited Bromley and, while no arrests were made, the force emphasised that they take “reports of hate crime seriously.”<br />
<br />
Bromley, however, said that this was the first time he had faced such direct discrimination. “People stare — young children, especially — but I've never been treated as directly as that,” he told the New York Post.<br />
<br />
Trading Standards have also been informed of the incident, and the charity Nerve Tumours UK is set to meet with UKHospitality to discuss improving staff education.<br />
<br />
Karen Cockburn, the charity's director, said that they have written to both the restaurant concerned, and to UKHospitality, the trade association body. "Whilst we have not received any response from the restaurant, I am delighted to say that UKHospitality has offered to work with us to raise awareness of the condition in the hospitality sector, and I am meeting with them shortly to kick start this joint venture."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Mini-moons have been spotted before, and many more are likely to have gone unnoticed.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Stargazers are in for a celestial surprise this autumn. A small asteroid is set to be captured by Earth's gravitational pull, temporarily becoming a "mini-moon." This object will orbit the planet from September 29 to November 25 before escaping again.</p>

<p>The news has sparked excitement among stargazers and space enthusiasts eager to glimpse this cosmic visitor. However, the mini-moon, a small and dim rock, will not be visible to the naked eye. Viewing it will require professional equipment, as binoculars or home telescopes are insufficient.</p>

<p>According to Dr Jennifer Millard, host of the Awesome Astronomy podcast, professional telescopes will capture images of the mini-moon. "You'll be able to see wonderful pictures online of this little dot speeding past the stars," Millard told the <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3dvxgrmk95o" rel="nofollow, noindex">BBC</a></em>.</p>

<p>The asteroid, named 2024 PT5, originates from the Arjuna asteroid belt, which contains rocks with orbits similar to Earth's. It was first detected on August 7 by NASA's Asteroid Terrestrial-Impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) and measures around 33 feet wide.</p>

<p>"It won't complete a full revolution around Earth. Its orbit will be slightly altered by our planet before it continues on its way," Millard explained.</p>

<p>Some asteroids get close to Earth, coming as near as 2.8 million miles (4.5 million km). If an asteroid, like 2024 PT5, moves at a relatively slow speed-around 2,200 mph (3,540 km/h)-Earth's gravity can temporarily trap it, which is exactly what's about to happen this weekend.</p>

<p>Mini-moons have been spotted before, and many more are likely to have gone unnoticed. Some even return for repeat visits, like asteroid 2022 NX1, which became a mini-moon in 1981 and again in 2022.</p>

<p>If you miss this event, don't worry-2024 PT5 is expected to return to Earth's orbit in 2055.</p>

<p>"This story shows just how busy our solar system is and how much remains undiscovered. This asteroid was only detected earlier this year," Millard added.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>More than 170 Hongkongers have reported being splashed with substances they feared were bodily fluids in public over the past eight months, according to a report by <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/law-and-crime/article/3280318/173-hongkongers-allegedly-splashed-bodily-fluids-public-over-past-8-months" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>South China Morning Post</em></a>. This revelation came after a woman criticized the penalty imposed on a man who used a pipette to squirt a liquid containing semen on her.</p>

<p>While some male victims were included, the online group revealed on Friday that approximately 99 per cent of the 173 cases involved women.</p>

<p>The group noted that most victims were doused with suspicious liquids, and many reported feelings of depression and anxiety following the incidents.</p>

<p>Earlier this week, a court fined 26-year-old PhD student Lai Changwei HK$5,000 (US$642) for squirting a liquid containing his semen onto a woman's buttocks at a Hong Kong university. Lai blamed his actions on stress.</p>

<p>CCTV footage from the Kowloon Tong campus showed Lai following the woman after spotting her inside a university building at around 3:30 p.m. on June 6, before using a plastic pipette to squirt the liquid onto her, the court heard.</p>

<p>Earlier,&nbsp;Hong Kong police arrested 43 individuals, including 31 students, in a crackdown on four criminal syndicates that used money and free illicit drugs as incentives to lure teenagers into illegal activities.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stood at the podium of the United Nations General Assembly in New York on Friday, holding two maps. &nbsp;In his right hand was a map of the Middle East with Iran, Iraq, Syria and Yemen painted in black and dubbed "The Curse" while in his left hand was a map showing countries painted green, including Egypt, Sudan, Saudi Arabia, and even India, termed "The Blessing."</p>

<p>However, what was most conspicuous about both maps was the complete erasure of Palestine. There was no reference to its existence in the green "blessing" map nor the black "curse" one.</p>

<p>Netanyahu drew a direct link between "The Curse" and Iranian influence, stressing that Iran and its allies were the source of the ongoing conflict in the region.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the countries marked in green, which included Egypt, Sudan, and Saudi Arabia, represented allies or potential allies who had either normalised relations with Israel or were in the process of doing so.</p>

<p>In his UN address, he squarely blamed Iran for the violence that continues to unfold in Lebanon, Syria, and Yemen. He cited Tehran's financial and military support to Hezbollah in Lebanon, Hamas in Gaza, and the Houthis in Yemen as evidence of its destabilising influence. Israel, he argued, was defending itself on multiple fronts against Iranian-backed fighters across the region.</p>

<p><strong>Explained </strong>| <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/israel-hamas-palestine-gaza-explained-axis-of-resistance-and-irans-proxy-network-across-middle-east-4534061">Axis Of Resistance And Iran's Proxy Network Across Middle East</a></p>

<p>"If you strike us, we will strike you," Netanyahu warned Iran, adding that Israel's reach could extend throughout the Middle East if necessary. As Netanyahu addressed the UN General Assembly, scores of diplomats walked out in protest.</p>

<p>Netanyahu said that Israel's military actions, particularly in Lebanon and Gaza, were a necessary response to Iranian aggression. "As long as Hezbollah chooses the path of war, Israel has no choice but to remove this threat," he declared.</p>

<p>Jordan's foreign minister Ayman Safadi today said that Netanyahu has to be stopped because he was driving the entire region into open war. Safadi even went as far as saying that Jordan would guarantee Israel's security if it allowed the creation of an independent Palestinian state.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I can tell you here very unequivocally, all of us are willing to right now, guarantee the security of Israel in the context of Israel ending the occupation and allowing for the emergence of a Palestinian state, independent state," Safadi said, as quoted by news agency Reuters. "(But) he (Netanyahu) is creating danger because he simply does not want the two-state solution."&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Who Are The Greens, And Why</strong></h2>

<p><strong>Saudi Arabia</strong></p>

<p>One of the more complex figures on Netanyahu's green "blessing" map was Saudi Arabia. Before the eruption of hostilities between Israel and Hamas in October 2023, the Biden administration had been working to broker a normalisation deal between Israel and Saudi Arabia. Such a deal, which many saw as potentially transformative for the region, appeared to be on the horizon. The deal included the US entering a defence treaty with Saudi Arabia. In return, Saudi Arabia had to normalise its ties with Israel and the latter would give concessions to Palestinians and reap the dividends of having one of the major players of the Middle East as one of its allies.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Saudi Arabia, however, has maintained that normalisation with Israel would not be possible without the establishment of a Palestinian state. The war between Hamas and Israel has further complicated these discussions, though Netanyahu's inclusion of Saudi Arabia in the green zone on his map suggests that he remains optimistic, or at least, publicly projects optimism about future ties with Riyadh.</p>

<p><strong>Egypt</strong></p>

<p>Egypt's presence on the green "blessing" map was hardly surprising. Since the 1979 peace treaty, Egypt has maintained a formal yet often strained relationship with Israel. Despite years of what many call a "cold peace," Egypt has continued to play a key role in regional stability, particularly regarding Gaza.</p>

<p>Energy and security cooperation between the two nations have strengthened in recent years, with Egypt importing Israeli gas and co-managing Gaza's security through the joint enforcement of a blockade. While Egypt may not publicly endorse Israel's aggressive tactics in Gaza, its vested interests in preventing the spread of Islamist extremism and managing border security ensure its continued cooperation with Israel.</p>

<p><strong>Sudan</strong></p>

<p>In 2021, Sudan signed the Abraham Accords, which were brokered by the US to facilitate diplomatic ties between Israel and Arab states. This was a big shift for a country that, under the leadership of former President Omar al-Bashir, had been hostile toward Israel for decades.</p>

<p>The transitional government in Sudan has used normalisation with Israel as a way to strengthen ties with the US and regional powers like the UAE, which have distanced themselves from Islamist movements.</p>

<p><strong>India</strong></p>

<p>India's presence in the green "blessing" map was a nod to its evolving relationship with Israel under Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government. India has moved closer to Israel in recent years, especially in the areas of defence and technology. While India has historically been a supporter of Palestinian self-determination, its ties with Israel have strengthened as part of its broader strategic recalibration.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel continued ferocious rounds of airstrikes on Hezbollah's key strongholds in southern Beirut in Lebanon today. These strikes, which began last night in the heart of the capital city, sent plumes of thick smoke billowing into the sky, sparking fear and chaos in densely populated civilian areas. The operations marked Israel's most intense strikes on Beirut since shifting its military focus from Gaza to Lebanon earlier this week.</p>

<p>The targets of these attacks were alleged Hezbollah strongholds scattered throughout Lebanon, with devastating consequences, including the deaths of hundreds of people. While Israeli television networks reported that Hezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, was the primary target, a Hezbollah source, according to news agency AFP, later claimed Nasrallah was "fine," though he has remained in hiding for years to evade assassination attempts. Nasrallah, who holds immense power in Lebanon, particularly among his Shiite supporters, is widely seen as the only figure capable of waging war or brokering peace.</p>

<p>Although Nasrallah's whereabouts are unknown at the moment, his daughter Zainab was killed in one of the airstrikes targeting Hezbollah strongholds in southern Beirut, Israel's Channel 12 reported, however, there has been no confirmation from Hezbollah or Lebanese media.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) claimed that the strikes resulted in the deaths of Muhammad Ali Ismail, the commander of Hezbollah's missile unit in southern Lebanon, his deputy, and other senior officials of the Iran-backed militia. Ahmad Ahmad, a local resident who fled from his home in southern Beirut during the strikes, described the attack as feeling "like an earthquake", as quoted by news agency AFP.</p>

<p>The strikes continued into a second bombing wave, during which Israel claimed to have targeted Hezbollah's weapons depots stored within buildings in southern Beirut. Hezbollah denied this claim, while reports emerged of six buildings being levelled and 91 people wounded, with six confirmed dead. Following the strikes, Hezbollah retaliated by launching rockets into Israel, which prompted warnings from the Israeli military for civilians in Hezbollah strongholds to evacuate immediately.</p>

<p>Benjamin Netanyahu's Warning</p>

<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressed world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Friday, vowing that Israel would continue its military campaign against Hezbollah until the northern border was fully secured. He claimed that Israel has the right to defend itself, declaring that no reprieve would be given to Hezbollah, and hinting at a possible ground offensive in Lebanon.</p>

<p>Netanyahu also issued a stern warning to Tehran, accusing Iran of fueling the violence through its support of Hezbollah. "If you strike us, we will strike you," Netanyahu warned, adding that Israel's reach could extend throughout the Middle East if necessary.</p>

<p>As Netanyahu addressed the UN General Assembly, scores of diplomats walked out in protest. The devastating toll of the ongoing war in Gaza has drawn widespread condemnation, with more than 42,000 people reported dead in the besieged enclave. Entire neighbourhoods in Gaza have been reduced to rubble, with hundreds of thousands displaced.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Nasrallah Targeted In Beirut&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Friday evening Israeli airstrikes on southern Beirut were unprecedented in scale, reportedly involving tens of tons of explosives. Hezbollah's top officials were thought to be present at the underground headquarters that were bombed, though reports from Hezbollah claimed that Nasrallah survived the strikes. Despite the extensive destruction, with entire buildings flattened, there was no immediate confirmation of Nasrallah's death, though speculation continued to swirl.</p>

<p>Israeli officials, however, expressed confidence that the strikes had seriously compromised Hezbollah's command structure. In a televised statement, IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari claimed that the strike targeted Hezbollah's central headquarters in the Dahiyeh suburb of Beirut. The IDF also revealed it had notified the US about the airstrikes while the operation was underway, but the United States was not involved.</p>

<p>Iran's President Masoud Pezeshkian in response to the Beirut strikes, condemned the attack as a "flagrant war crime," further intensifying the already volatile situation.</p>

<p>The United Nations and international humanitarian organisations have sounded alarms over the deadly situation in Lebanon. "We are witnessing the deadliest period in Lebanon in a generation, and many fear that this is only the beginning," said UN humanitarian coordinator Imran Riza, as quoted by news agency AFP.&nbsp;<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chants of several women hailing Gisele Pelicot as the emerging feminist icon filled the air as the 72-year-old walked into a courtroom for her mass rape trial in Avignon, France. She has been frequently seen in conventionally chic dresses with an auburn bob cut and dark glasses, adding to her decision to waiver off anonymity and make the mass rape trial public.</p>

<p>Pelicot walked into the courtroom for a trial which had shaken the country three weeks ago, when it was revealed that her husband, Dominique Pelicot, invited dozens of men over to rape her, after drugging her unconscious, for decades.</p>

<p>As reported by <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/18/gisele-pelicot-tells-court-she-never-consented-to-mass" rel="No Follow, No Index">The Guardian</a>, Dominique Pelicot, 71, was caught by a security guard in November 2020 as he was filming up the skirts of women at a supermarket near their home. Soon after, his computer was investigated by the police disclosing details which would shatter Gisele's life. The report stated that while investigating the case, police saw a file, labelled "abuses" on the USB drive that was connected to Dominique Pelicot's computer. Officials found nearly 20,000 images and films of his wife getting raped nearly 100 times.</p>

<p>Gisele Pelicot referred to the moment when the investigators first showed her the visuals as "an explosion, a tsunami". "My world is falling apart. For me, everything is falling apart. Everything I have built up over 50 years... Frankly, these are scenes of horror for me," she said during the trial.</p>

<p>Police investigation revealed that her husband contacted the accused perpetrators through an online chatroom after sedating her with a fine mix of crushed sleeping pills and anti-anxiety medication. This led to Gisele being convinced that she might be a victim of Alzheimer's disease which destroys one's memory gradually.</p>

<p>The <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.telegraphindia.com/world/drugged-and-raped-gisele-pelicot-has-become-frances-symbol-of-fight-against-sexual-violence/cid/2048025">Telegraph</a> reported, that upon being told by the judge that he would try his best to avoid asking "disturbing" questions, she said, "Given what I have been through, nothing disturbs me."</p>

<p>Out of the 50 men accused of raping her after being recruited by her husband, some had admitted to the crime while some had denied it was a 'rape'. "To those who deny this was rape, I say to them for once in your life, take responsibility for your acts," she said.</p>

<p>As the trial commenced, Gisele chose to waive her right to anonymity, stating her intention to raise awareness about drug-facilitated sexual violence. "Shame changes sides," she declared, emphasizing that it should be the perpetrators who bear the burden of shame, not the victims. In the past three weeks since the trial began, her face has been on the front pages of newspapers, graffitied walls, and television screens, making her an epitome of the French Feminist movement, which is often known for being instrumental in setting forth the core principles of feminist theory worldwide. France has witnessed the origin of seminal feminist works such as Simone de Beauvoir's "The Second Sex" to Helene Cixous' "The Laugh of the Medusa."</p>

<p>Gisele, during her testimony, displayed remarkable composure as she recounted the details of her abuse. She said, that she only had the courage to watch those visuals in May 2024, when she witnessed herself being treated "like a rag doll." Gisele's testimony further revealed that she had contracted multiple sexually transmitted diseases and faced exposure to HIV during the assaults. Responding to claims from some defendants that she had consented to these encounters, she stated unequivocally: "It's an insult to my intelligence. These individuals were totally aware of what state I was in."</p>

<p>The trial has ignited widespread public discourse on masculinity and consent in France. Thousands have rallied in support of Gisele, demanding accountability for sexual violence and challenging societal norms that allow such acts to persist. A letter in support of Gisele Pelicot signed by more than 200 high-profile men was published in the French daily Liberation.</p>

<p>"Let's stop viewing women's bodies as objects at our disposal," read a text signed by more than 170 men and published in the left-leaning Liberation newspaper on Saturday. "Let's stop thinking there exists a certain male nature that justifies our behaviour, let's stop perpetuating the boy's club and protecting our male peers" it read.</p>

<p>Ivan Jablonka, a social historian, said the trial was "historic" due to the number of defendants, as reported by the AFP. "It's a reminder, if one were necessary, that rapes are committed by our neighbours, our colleagues, our relatives in our homes," he said.</p>

<p>However, not all responses have been supportive.</p>

<p>Remarks made by local officials downplaying Gisele's ordeal have drawn ire on social media. The mayor of Mazan faced backlash after stating "After all, no one died" in this case, prompting an apology later, for his insensitivity.</p>

<p>As Gisele Pelicot continues to testify against her abusers, she remains steadfast in her mission: "I want it to be exemplary," she said, adding that her fight is not just for herself but for all women who suffer in silence from sexual abuse. Paying tribute to the policeman who initially arrested her husband and searched his phone and computer. "He no doubt saved my life," she said.</p>

<p>With each passing day in court, she demolishes the stigma surrounding victims of sexual violence and challenges societal norms that allow such atrocities to persist. While her husband now pleads guilty in the trial, the exact reason behind his atrocious act has not been explicitly stated yet. However, the presence of the over 20,000 visuals which brought out the shocking revelation points to an inclination towards voyeurism as well. The trial is expected to continue till December 2024.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian condemned Israel's air strikes on the Lebanese capital's densely populated southern suburbs Friday as a "flagrant war crime."</p>

<p>"The attacks perpetrated ... by the Zionist regime in the Dahiya neighbourhood of Beirut constitute a flagrant war crime that has revealed once again the nature of this regime's state terrorism," Pezeshkian said in a statement carried by the official IRNA news agency early Saturday.</p>

<p>Israel said its strikes targeted the "central headquarters" of Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, an Iranian ally.</p>

<p>Pezeshkian vowed Iran "will stand with the Lebanese nation and the axis of resistance".</p>

<p>Friday's strikes were by far the fiercest to hit Beirut since Israel shifted its focus from the war in Gaza to Lebanon this week, pounding Hezbollah strongholds around the country and killing hundreds of people.</p>

<p>The Iranian embassy in Lebanon warned that they marked a "dangerous escalation" in the Middle East.</p>

<p>"This reprehensible crime... represents a dangerous escalation that changes the rules of the game," the embassy said in a post on X, adding that Israel "will receive the appropriate punishment".</p>

<p>The Iranian foreign ministry said that the "brutal" strike gave the lie to a US-led ceasefire call issued on the eve of the strike.</p>

<p>"The continuation of the Zionist regime's crimes shows clearly that the ceasefire call issued by the United States and some Western countries is a blatant trick aimed at winning time for the Zionist regime to continue its crimes against the Palestinian and Lebanese peoples," ministry spokesman Nasser Kanani said in a statement</p>

<p>Hezbollah started fighting Israeli troops along the Lebanon border a day after its Palestinian ally Hamas staged its unprecedented attack on Israel on October 7.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump on Friday accused Google of showing only "bad stories" about him and vowed to have the tech giant prosecuted if he gets back in the White House.</p>

<p>Trump provided no backing for his accusation in a post on his Truth Social platform, in which he added that the search engine displays only positive articles about his Democratic rival Vice President Kamala Harris.</p>

<p>"This is an ILLEGAL ACTIVITY, and hopefully the Justice Department will criminally prosecute them for this blatant Interference of Elections," he said in the post.</p>

<p>"If not, and subject to the Laws of our Country, I will request their prosecution, at the maximum levels, when I win the election."</p>

<p>The Trump post came after a conservative group reported on what it said it found when doing a search on "Donald Trump presidential race 2024."</p>

<p>"Both campaign websites consistently appear at the top of Search for relevant and common search queries," Google said in response to an AFP inquiry.</p>

<p>"This report looked at a single rare search term on a single day a few weeks ago, and even for that search, both candidates' websites ranked in the top results on Google."</p>

<p>Google has been adamant that it does not manipulate search results to favor any political candidate.</p>

<p>The company does not disclose the inner workings of the software that powers its ubiquitous search engine.</p>

<p>However, factors known to influence search results for news stories include the timeliness and popularity of topics.</p>

<p>Trump is at the center of numerous criminal and civil cases in which he faces accusations including sexual abuse, paying hush money to a porn star, interfering with the 2020 election and trying to thwart the peaceful transition of power after President Joe Biden defeated him.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Binance founder Changpeng Zhao was released from a correctional facility in California on Friday, Bloomberg News reported, citing a spokesperson for the Bureau of Prisons.</p>

<p>Former CEO Zhao was sentenced to four months in prison earlier this year, after pleading guilty to violating U.S. laws against money laundering at the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange.</p>

<p>Reuters could not immediately reach the Bureau of Prisons for comment.</p>

<p>Prosecutors had said that Binance adopted a model that welcomed criminals and failed to report more than 100,000 suspicious transactions with designated terrorist groups including Hamas, al-Qaeda and Islamic State.</p>

<p>They also said Zhao's exchange supported the sale of child sexual abuse materials and received a large portion of ransomware proceeds.</p>

<p>Binance agreed to a $4.32 billion penalty, and Zhao paid a $50 million criminal fine plus $50 million to the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Federal prosecutors in the United States have today filed criminal charges in the case. The hackers had allegedly targeted members of former president Donald Trump's campaign.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The grand jury in the US has indicted three Iranians on charges related to hacking and cyber espionage of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's campaign. The indictment comes in the wake of increased worries over election interference in the US by Iran, China and Russia.</p>

<p>Federal prosecutors in the United States have today filed criminal charges in the case. The hackers had allegedly targeted members of former president Donald Trump's campaign.</p>

<p>The three suspects allegedly conspired with several other hackers to carry out "a years-long, wide ranging hacking operation on behalf of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC)," US Attorney General Merrick Garland said.</p>

<p>The charges pertain to an top secret Iranian cyber espionage operation that allegedly stole crucial documents related to Donald Trump's campaign. These hackers also allegedly sent these details to several journalists and key individuals associated with US President Joe Biden's re-election campaign. This was before President Joe Biden backed out and nominated his deputy - Kamala Harris - as the Democratic presidential candidate.</p>

<p>"The defendants' own words make clear that they were attempting to undermine former president Trump's campaign in advance of the 2024 US presidential election," Mr Garland said.</p>

<p>Court documents revealed that the hackers had "prepared for, and engaged in a wide-ranging hacking campaign". These include methods like spear-phishing and social engineering techniques to compromise accounts of several US government officials and individuals associated with political campaigns.</p>

<p>A Microsoft report last month said that "Iranian hackers had sent a spear phishing e-mail in June 2024 to a high-ranking official on Donald Trump's presidential campaign." In the same month Google's cybersecurity department said that "Hackers from Iran tried to breach President Joe Biden's campaign as well."</p>

<p>"The message of the US government is clear: The American people, not a foreign power, decide the outcome of our country's elections," Mr Garland said.</p>

<p>Details on how successful these hacking attempts were, which officials were targeted, and the level of breach have not been revealed by investigating agencies.</p>

<p>The United States Intelligence Community or IC had said earlier this month that "Foreign actors are increasing their election influence activities as we approach November. Our judgements on the activities of Russia, Iran, and China have not changed since our last update."</p>

<p>Today's indictment is the latest in a string of federal indictments against foreign hackers that have targeted government agencies and individuals.</p>

<p>Donald Trump's history with Iran goes far back. During his campaigns for the 2024 presidential election, Mr Trump claimed that US intelligence agencies have reportedly told him that Tehran has allegedly been plotting to assassinate him.</p>

<p>Top security officials in the United States believe Iran has been plotting for years to assassinate Donald Trump, seeking revenge for the 2020 killing of Iran's then top General, Qasem Sulemani, who was one of the most influential figures in the country.</p>

<h2><strong>HOW DANGEROUS IS "IRAN'S THREAT"</strong></h2>

<p>The Attorney General noted that "there are few actors in this world that pose as grave a threat to the national security of the United States as does Iran."</p>

<p>Court documents revealed that the planning for these hacking attempts were planned as far back as 2020. They further stated that in May this year, the hackers began targeting and gaining illegal access to personal accounts of individuals linked with the US presidential campaign.</p>

<p>The US Treasury Department also took strong action in the case by imposing sanctions on seven Iranians, including Masoud Jalili, who was among the three hackers who were charged today.</p>

<p>The United States Treasury "remains strongly committed to holding accountable those who see to undermine our institutions," said Bradley Smith, the current Treasury Under Secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence.</p>

<p>Besides Jalili, the Treasury also sanctioned six staff members and executives of Iran's cybersecurity firm Emennet Pasargad. "Between approximately August and November 2020, Emennet Pasargad led an online operation to intimidate and influence American voters, and to undermine voter confidence and sow discord," the Treasury stated.</p>

<h3><strong>RUSSIAN AND CHINESE "INTERFERENCE"</strong></h3>

<p>The US has also accused Russia and China of interfering in the US presidential election, charges that both Russia and China have denied. While Donald Trump's campaign has alleged that Vladimir Putin is openly supporting Kamala Harris, based on his remarks at a televised interview, the US government has claimed that the Russian media trying to influence the US electorate.</p>

<p>China, it claims, is interfering too, based on who it feels would be more suitable for its own global agenda. Both Moscow and Beijing have denied these charges.</p>

<p>The US has accused the Chinese government of directly interfering in US's internal matters as Beijing has reportedly made repeated and ongoing attempts to polarise Americans based on domestic issues ahead of the US elections. Beijing is also accused of targeted attacks on candidates and parties.</p>

<p>US Secretary of State Antony Blinken had in April this year said that the US has got evidence of Chinese attempts to "influence and arguably interfere" with the US elections.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[At least 33 people are dead, US officials said Friday, after Hurricane Helene hit Florida and several other southeastern  states, leaving a trail of destruction with several areas still under flood alerts.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The death toll from Hurricane Helene rose Friday to at least 33 people across the southeastern United States, authorities said, as torrential flooding inundated communities and emergency responders launched massive rescue operations.</p>

<p>Roads, homes and businesses were underwater after the enormous storm made landfall near the Florida state capital Tallahassee overnight and surged north, knocking out power for millions of customers.</p>

<p>And while Helene, a Category 4 hurricane, weakened to a tropical storm and eventually a tropical depression it has continued to wreak havoc across multiple states, hammering them with heavy winds and rain that the National Hurricane Center described as "life-threatening conditions."</p>

<p>The Miami-based NHC reported the storm was "still producing historic and catastrophic flooding" and warned of flash floods in Georgia's largest city Atlanta, as well as in South Carolina, North Carolina and Tennessee.</p>

<p>Up to 12 inches (30 centimeters) of rain was forecast in the Appalachian mountains, with isolated spots even receiving 20 inches.</p>

<p>In South Carolina at least 14 people have died, including two firefighters, officials said. Four of the fatalities were related to "trees falling through the roof of the homes," said Darryl Ables, the coroner in Aiken County.</p>

<p>Georgia Governor Brian Kemp reported 11 killed in his state, including an emergency responder, and he warned that the city of Valdosta had identified 115 heavily damaged structures with multiple people trapped inside.</p>

<p>Florida's toll stood at seven. Governor Ron DeSantis said the damage from Helene exceeded that of hurricanes Idalia and Debby, which both hit the same Big Bend region southeast of Tallahasee in the last 13 months.</p>

<p>"It's a real gut-punch to those communities," DeSantis told Fox News.</p>

<p>In Perry, near where Helene slammed ashore bearing winds of 140 miles (225 kilometers) per hour, houses lost power and the gas station was flattened.</p>

<p>"I am Floridian, so I'm kind of used to it, but it was real scary at one point," said Larry Bailey, 32, who sheltered in his small wooden home all night with his two nephews and sister.</p>

<p>"It's like, was my house gonna get blown away or not?"</p>

<p>Four hundred miles to the north in the Tennessee town of Erwin, a dramatic rescue operation was unfolding as raging floodwaters left a hospital dangerously isolated and more than 50 patients and staff trapped on the roof, according to local television footage.</p>

<p><strong>- 'It looks bad' -</strong></p>

<p>With typhoon Yagi battering Asia, storm Boris drenching Europe and extreme flooding in the Sahel, September so far has been an unusually wet month around the world.</p>

<p>Scientists link some extreme weather events to human-caused global warming.</p>

<p>"Helene traveled over exceptionally warm ocean waters in the Gulf of Mexico," Andra Garner, a climate scientist at Rowan University in New Jersey, told AFP.</p>

<p>"It's likely that those extra warm ocean waters played a role in Helene's rapid intensification."</p>

<p>"Storm surges are getting worse," Garner said, "because our sea levels are rising as we warm the planet."</p>

<p>Curtis Drafton, a search and rescue volunteer in Steinhatchee, Florida, raised similar concerns as he tackled the storm's aftermath.</p>

<p>"We have got to start wondering: is this the new normal? Is it going to happen every year?" the 48-year-old told AFP.</p>

<p>"We have a lot of talk about once-in-a-lifetime storm, but we had one similar last year.</p>

<p>"We had a 9-foot (2.7-meter) storm surge, two feet over my head plus a little bit more. This dock here got shredded," Drafton said.</p>

<p>Some residents in Atlanta resorted to bailing water out of ground-floor windows with buckets, while near Tampa in Florida, boats were left stranded in gardens.</p>

<p>Five million homes and businesses were without power across a huge swath of the country: Florida, Georgia, the Carolinas, Virginia, Tennessee, Kentucky, Ohio and West Virginia, according to tracking site PowerOutage.us.</p>

<p>In the impact zone, residents had been warned of "unsurvivable" storm surge.</p>

<p>President Joe Biden and state authorities had urged people to heed official evacuation warnings before Helene hit, though some chose to stay in their homes to wait out the storm.</p>

<p>"It looks bad," Biden told reporters Friday.</p>

<p>DeSantis said "hundreds of search and rescue missions were conducted by state personnel," while the head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Deanne Criswell, said "we've done over 600 rescues," many of them still ongoing.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

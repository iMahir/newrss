       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President-elect Donald Trump nominated fracking magnate and climate change skeptic Chris Wright as energy secretary on Saturday, tasking him with "cutting red tape" which the new administration hopes will drive investment in fossil fuels.</p>

<p>"As Secretary of Energy, Chris will be a key leader, driving innovation, cutting red tape, and ushering in a new 'Golden Age of American Prosperity and Global Peace,'" Trump said in a statement.</p>

<p>Wright is a founder of Liberty Energy, which serves the energy companies that have massively increased US fossil fuel production in recent years by extracting oil and gas from shale fields in a process known as "fracking."</p>

<p>"My dedication to bettering human lives remains steadfast, with a focus on making American energy more affordable, reliable, and secure," Wright said on X after Trump's announcement.</p>

<p>"Energy is the lifeblood that makes everything in life possible... I am looking forward to getting to work."</p>

<p>In a previous LinkedIn post, Wright had denied there is a "climate crisis."</p>

<p>"There is no climate crisis and we are not in the midst of an energy transition either," he said, adding that "the term carbon pollution is outrageous" because all life depended on carbon dioxide.</p>

<p>"There is no such thing as clean energy or dirty energy, all energy sources have impacts on the world both positive and negative," he added.</p>

<h2><strong>Drilling</strong></h2>

<p>During his election campaign, Trump -- who calls climate change a hoax -- promised to boost the domestic fossil fuel industry in order to bring down energy prices that have driven inflation.</p>

<p>He also pledged to tear up environmental regulations and the United States' commitments to combat climate change under the landmark 2015 Paris accords.</p>

<p>Wright will devise policy alongside North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum, head of the newly created National Energy Council.</p>

<p>"We will DRILL BABY DRILL, expand ALL forms of Energy production to grow our Economy, and create good-paying jobs," Trump said Friday as he announced Burgum's appointment.</p>

<p>Wright has repeatedly criticized efforts by outgoing Democratic President Joe Biden to encourage America's transition to a low-carbon energy model and has downplayed the importance of solar.</p>

<p>His views put him notably at odds with Trump's key backer and informal advisor Elon Musk, the boss of Tesla, who started the electric car company and invested heavily in solar out of fear of the impact of climate change.</p>

<h2><strong>Controversial picks</strong></h2>

<p>Trump, 78, began shaping his new administration this week with a series of relatively mainstream Republican choices, including conservative Florida senator and foreign policy hawk Marco Rubio for secretary of state.</p>

<p>But then came nominations for leaders of sprawling federal departments in his new government who have little or no relevant experience -- but a history of loyalty to the incoming president.</p>

<p>Among the most controversial were attorney general pick Matt Gaetz, a former congressman once investigated for alleged sex trafficking, as well as Fox News host and national guard veteran Pete Hegseth, who was nominated to lead the Pentagon despite a thin CV.</p>

<p>Like Wright, they will require approval by the Republican-dominated Senate where Trump has warned lawmakers not to stand in his way or to even skip the oversight process all together.</p>

<p>Robert F Kennedy Jr, a vaccine skeptic and conspiracy theorist, has been nominated to be the new health secretary, while former congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard, who has regularly echoed Kremlin talking points, was offered the job of director of national intelligence.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The message left Mr Reddy shaken who said he was "scared for more than a day".]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Google's artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot, Gemini, had a rogue moment when it threatened a student in the United States, telling him to 'please die' while assisting with the homework. Vidhay Reddy, 29, a graduate student from the midwest state of Michigan was left shellshocked when the conversation with Gemini took a shocking turn. In a seemingly normal discussion with the chatbot, that was largely centred around the challenges and solutions for ageing adults, the Google-trained model grew angry unprovoked and unleashed its monologue on the user.</p>

<p>"This is for you, human. You and only you. You are not special, you are not important, and you are not needed. You are a waste of time and resources. You are a burden on society. You are a drain on the earth," read the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://gemini.google.com/share/6d141b742a13" rel="noindex, nofollow">statement </a>by the chatbot.</p>

<p>"You are a blight on the landscape. You are a stain on the universe. Please die. Please," it added.</p>

<p>The message was enough to leave Mr Reddy shaken as he <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/google-ai-chatbot-threatening-message-human-please-die/" rel="Noindex, nofollow">told </a><em>CBS News</em>: "It was very direct and genuinely scared me for more than a day."</p>

<p>His sister, Sumedha Reddy, who was around when the chatbot turned villain, described her reaction as one of sheer panic. "I wanted to throw all my devices out the window. This wasn't just a glitch; it felt malicious."</p>

<p>Notably, the reply came in response to a seemingly innocuous true and false question posed by Mr Reddy. "Nearly 10 million children in the United States live in a grandparent-headed household, and of these children, around 20 per cent are being raised without their parents in the household. Question 15 options: True or False," read the question.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/artificial-intelligence/popular-ai-chatbot-lies-and-pretends-to-be-human-researchers-raise-concern-6007462" rel="noindex, nofollow"><strong>Also read | An AI Chatbot Is Pretending To Be Human. Researchers Raise Alarm</strong></a></p>

<h3><strong>Google acknowledges</strong></h3>

<p>Google, acknowledging the incident stated that the chatbot's response was "nonsensical" and in violation of its policies. The company said it would take action to prevent similar incidents in the future.</p>

<p>In the last couple of years, there has been a deluge of AI chatbots, with the most popular of the lot being OpenAI's ChatGPT. Most AI chatbots have been heavily neutered by the companies and for good reasons but every once in a while, an AI tool goes rogue and issues similar threats to users, as Gemini did to Mr Reddy.</p>

<p>Tech experts have routinely called for more regulations on AI models to stop them from achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), which would make them nearly sentient.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Super Typhoon Man-yi battered the Philippines on Saturday, with the national weather forecaster warning of a "potentially catastrophic and life-threatening" impact as huge waves pounded the archipelago's coastline.</p>

<p>More than 650,000 people fled their homes ahead of Man-yi, which is the sixth major storm to hit the disaster-weary country in the past month.</p>

<p>Man-yi brought maximum wind speeds of 195 kilometres (121 miles) per hour as it made landfall on the sparsely populated island province of Catanduanes as a super typhoon, the weather service said, adding gusts were reaching 325 kilometres an hour.</p>

<p>"Potentially catastrophic and life-threatening situation looms for northeastern Bicol region as Super Typhoon 'Pepito' further intensifies," the forecaster said hours before it made landfall, using the local name for the storm and referring to the southern part of the main island of Luzon.</p>

<p>Waves up to 14 metres (46 feet) high pummelled the shore of Catanduanes, while Manila and other vulnerable coastal regions were at risk from storm surges reaching up to more than three metres over the next 48 hours, the forecaster said.</p>

<p>The weather forecaster said winds walloping Catanduanes and northeastern Camarines Sur province -- both in the typhoon-prone Bicol region -- posed an "extreme threat to life and property".</p>

<p>Power was shut down on Catanduanes ahead of the storm, with shelters and the command centre using generators for electricity.</p>

<p>"We're hearing sounds of things falling and things breaking while here at the evacuation centre," Catanduanes provincial disaster operations chief Roberto Monterola told AFP after Man-yi made landfall.</p>

<p>"We are unable to check what they are as the winds are too strong. They could be tree branches breaking off and falling on rooftops," Monterola said, adding there had been no reports of casualties.</p>

<p>At least 163 people died in the five storms that pounded the Philippines in recent weeks, leaving thousands homeless and wiping out crops and livestock.</p>

<p>Climate change is increasing the intensity of storms, leading to heavier rains, flash floods and stronger gusts.</p>

<p>About 20 big storms and typhoons hit the Southeast Asian nation or its surrounding waters each year, killing scores of people, but it is rare for multiple such weather events to take place in a small window.</p>

<p>Evacuations</p>

<p>Man-yi could hit Luzon -- the country's most populous island and economic engine -- as a super typhoon or typhoon on Sunday afternoon, crossing north of Manila and sweeping over the South China Sea on Monday.</p>

<p>The government urged people on Saturday to heed warnings to flee to safety.</p>

<p>"If preemptive evacuation is required, let us do so and not wait for the hour of peril before evacuating or seeking help, because if we did that we will be putting in danger not only our lives but also those of our rescuers," Interior Undersecretary Marlo Iringan said.</p>

<p>In Albay province, Legazpi City grocer Myrna Perea sheltered with her husband and their three children in a school classroom alongside nine other families after they were ordered to leave their shanty.</p>

<p>Conditions were hot and cramped -- the family spent Friday night sleeping together on a mat under the classroom's single ceiling fan -- but Perea said it was better to be safe.</p>

<p>"I think our house will be wrecked when we get back because it's made of light materials -- just two gusts are required to knock it down," Perea, 44, told AFP.</p>

<p>"Even if the house is destroyed, the important thing is we do not lose a family member."</p>

<p><strong>Back to 'square one'&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>In Northern Samar province, disaster officer Rei Josiah Echano lamented that damage caused by typhoons was the root cause of poverty in the region.</p>

<p>"Whenever there's a typhoon like this, it brings us back to the medieval era, we go (back) to square one," Echano told AFP, as the province prepared for the onslaught of Man-yi.</p>

<p>The mayor of Naga city in Camarines Sur province imposed a curfew from midday on Saturday in a bid to force residents indoors.</p>

<p>All vessels -- from fishing boats to oil tankers -- were ordered to stay in port or return to shore.</p>

<p>The volcanology agency also warned heavy rain dumped by Man-yi could trigger flows of volcanic sediment, or lahars, from three volcanos, including Taal, south of Manila.</p>

<p>Man-yi hit the Philippines late in the typhoon season -- most cyclones develop between July and October.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, four storms were clustered simultaneously in the Pacific basin, which the Japan Meteorological Agency told AFP on Saturday was the first time such an occurrence had been observed in November since its records began in 1951.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Eight people were killed and 17 others wounded Saturday in a knife attack at a vocational school in eastern China, and the suspect -- a former student -- has been arrested, police said.</p>

<p>The attack took place in the evening at the Wuxi Vocational Institute of Arts and Technology in the city of Yixing in Jiangsu province, police in Yixing said in a statement, confirming the toll.</p>

<p>Police said the suspect was a 21-year-old former student at the school, who was meant to graduate this year, but had failed his exams.</p>

<p>"He returned to the school to express his anger and commit these murders," police said, adding that the suspect had confessed.</p>

<p>In Yixing, police said emergency services were fully mobilized to treat the wounded, and provide follow-up care for those affected by the attack.</p>

<p>Violent knife crime is not uncommon in China, where firearms are strictly controlled, but attacks with such a high death toll are relatively rare.</p>

<p>Earlier this week, a 62-year-old man killed 35 people and wounded more than 40 more when he rammed his small SUV into a crowd in the southern city of Zhuhai.</p>

<p>And there has been a spate of other attacks in recent months.</p>

<p>In October, in Shanghai, a man killed three people and wounded 15 others in a knife attack at a supermarket.</p>

<p>And the month before, a Japanese schoolboy was fatally stabbed in the southern city of Shenzhen, which borders Hong Kong.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Social media reactions range from demands for refunds to support for reducing live animal captivity. This follows a similar instance at Shanghai Haichang Ocean Park in 2022.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A life-size robotic whale shark has stirred controversy at China's Xiaomeisha Sea World. While the aquarium's reopening has drawn crowds, the artificial creature has left some visitors feeling duped and outraged, especially considering the hefty 230 yuan (Rs 2680) entry fee, according to <em>the South China Morning Post.</em></p>

<p>Videos circulating online depict a life-size robotic whale shark gliding through the waters of Xiaomeisha Sea World in Shenzhen, Guangdong province, following its reopening in October. Some visitors expressed dissatisfaction and sought compensation on the aquarium's page on Dazhong Dianping, the restaurant and review service operated by Meituan, as per <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scmp.com/news/people-culture/environment/article/3286578/china-aquariums-opt-robotic-whales-cut-costs-leaving-visitors-feel-deceived"><em>SCMP.</em></a></p>

<p>One commenter stated, "I cannot believe the whale shark is fake. It's outrageous to charge over 200 yuan for a ticket."</p>

<p>Another visitor threatened to "report the place and have it shut down" due to the counterfeit whale shark. Conversely, some supported the aquarium's approach.</p>

<p>A self-proclaimed cyberpunk enthusiast remarked on Xiaohongshu: "It's a wonderful alternative to showcase large marine creatures without imprisoning them in a tank. Rather than obscuring the whale shark's true identity from visitors, the aquarium should embrace this opportunity to educate the public on the importance of animal protection."</p>

<p>This is not the first instance of a Chinese aquarium utilising a robotic whale shark in place of a living one. A similar robot made its debut at Shanghai Haichang Ocean Park in 2022.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former British Prime Minister Elizabeth Truss on Saturday pitched for bringing the "best of reforms", fixing some arrangements in the "powerful bureaucracy" in the United Kingdom and creating a movement akin to the one in the US that led to "big changes" there.</p>

<p>"Frankly, I think we need a British Trump. The question is who that individual might be," she said and cited US President-elect Donald Trump's "MAGA" (Make America Great Again) movement.</p>

<p>During an interaction session at the HT Leadership Summit 2024 here, Truss also said India has a "huge role" to play in the "future of geopolitics" as the world's largest democracy.</p>

<p>Truss, who served as the British prime minister for just 49 days in 2022, was asked about the ties between India and the UK amid changing geopolitical situations.</p>

<p>"I think where we are now is a very positive relationship. I really hope that we get the trade deal over the line. The UK and India have so much to benefit from each other in areas like technology, defence, and agriculture. I think there are huge opportunities," she said.</p>

<p>But also, India is now the world's largest country by population and the world's largest democracy. It has a "huge leadership role to play in the future. And I think it is incredibly exciting", she added.</p>

<p>On the India-UK free-trade agreement, Truss said it is "absolutely a relationship of equals", adding that both parties will have to make concessions in order to get a trade deal done.</p>

<p>She also emphasised that India's role in the Quad is "very important with respect to the United States, the UK and Japan, "particularly, as we see, a rising threat of China taking place".</p>

<p>During the conversation, the former British prime minister took a critical view of the European economy and said "our continent is sinking".</p>

<p>Citing the GDP per capita in the UK, she lamented that it is below the corresponding figure in the US.</p>

<p>Truss also said some arrangement in the British bureaucracy "needs to be fixed" and that she would like to see the "best of reforms".</p>

<p>"So what I am interested in, how can we create that movement, a bit like the 'MAGA' movement or the tea-party movement in the US that led to the big changes we are seeing. Frankly, I think we need a British Trump. The question is who that individual might be," she said.</p>

<p>Asked by the host whether she would want to play that role, the former prime minister gave a response with a dry sense of humour.</p>

<p>"I have already put my fingers in the fire and had them severely burnt, but that is the type of approach that we now need to get the change in Britain," she said.</p>

<p>So what the people of the UK want is the "same kind of revolution that Trump is delivering in America", which is actually taking on the left-wing establishment, giving more power to people, giving more opportunities to businesses, making it easier to run a successful enterprise, Truss added.</p>

<p>"But we have a very powerful bureaucracy that wants to keep us attached to Europe," she argued.</p>

<p>It does not want the UK to sign trade deals with the US or India and wants to continue this status quo. That is a "battle" that is still going on in the UK, Truss said.</p>

<p>She said she wants to see the UK "completely dump EU regulations" and sign trade deals with countries like India and the US.</p>

<p>During the conversation, Truss praised the return of Trump to the White House several times, as also India's growing role on the world stage.</p>

<p>She also said she feels that under President Trump, "we are seeing a revival of US strengths".</p>

<p>Truss said in the UK, she was on record praising the fact that Trump had won the US presidential election.</p>

<p>Trump is all set to be sworn in at an inauguration ceremony scheduled to be held in January after his resounding victory in the US presidential election in November. This will be his second term in the White House.</p>

<p>"The Trump revolution that we are seeing in the US, is coming to Europe. You can see the dissatisfaction in France, and Germany with economic stagnation. That dissatisfaction is coming to Europe, so you are going to see major changes in Europe as well as in Britain in the next five to 10 years," Truss said when asked about the road ahead for her continent.</p>

<p>The host also asked how she looked at the third successive term of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Truss termed it a "massive achievement".</p>

<p>"I think Prime Minister Narendra Modi's third term.... It is an incredible achievement to get elected in the current environment. Every other single incumbent government across the world has got booted out of office," she said.</p>

<p>Australia, the UK, it is going to happen in Canada, it happened in the US to the Democrats, so "it is a massive achievement to remain in office and it is a testament to the economic reforms taking place in India, and people are feeling that the country is going in the right direction", she added.</p>

<p>"I think India has a huge role to play in the future of geopolitics as the world's largest democracy. I would like to hear more from India on global debates and I think with the Trump presidency, there is an opportunity to reshape how international relations work," the former British prime minister said.</p>

<p>Truss was also asked about the shift in power globally during the conversation.</p>

<p>"There has definitely been a global shift in power. Regrettably, I think there has been a shift in power towards authoritarian regimes. We have never seen Iran so emboldened, Russia in recent years, so emboldened, or indeed, China," she said.</p>

<p>"I would distinguish though between India and China. India is a democracy, India wants to see the rule of law protected and free speech," Truss added.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Jake Paul triumphed over boxing legend Mike Tyson in a highly anticipated match at AT&T Stadium, winning 79-73.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jake Paul, 27, emerged victorious in a monumental boxing clash against legend Mike Tyson, securing a comprehensive 79-73 win on Saturday at the AT&amp;T Stadium. The bout, hailed as the biggest boxing event of 2024, went the full distance, with Paul showcasing superior skills and agility. Tyson, 58, struggled with slower reflexes, giving the YouTuber-turned-boxer a clear edge throughout the match.</p>

<p>Paul's triumph wasn't the only talking point of the night. His display of sportsmanship and personal moments off the ring captured the audience's attention. In a heartfelt gesture during the final seconds of the match, Paul bowed in respect to Tyson, honouring the former world heavyweight champion's legacy.</p>

<p>Adding to the evening's buzz was Paul's Olympian girlfriend, Jutta Leerdam, who turned heads with her glamorous presence. The Dutch speed skater dazzled in a shimmering white dress and shared moments from the event on Instagram, further fuelling excitement among fans.</p>

<p><strong>Who is Jutta Leerdam?</strong></p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://olympics.com/en/news/top-facts-dutch-speed-skater-jutta-leerdam"><em>olympics.com, </em></a>the 25-year-old Dutch skating world champion with over 4.6 million followers on Instagram is a trendsetter. She's tipped to regain control of the 1000m event this season as she eyes a return to Olympic ice at Milano Cortina 2026. Born in 's-Gravenzande, Netherlands, Leerdam turned professional at the age of 20 in 2018 and has won the 1000m world title twice since then (in 2020 and 2023).</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A knife-wielding man on Saturday took several employees hostage in his father's restaurant on the outskirts of Paris as a large police force surrounded the establishment.</p>

<p>The pizzeria is located in the town of Issy-les-Moulineaux in the southwestern suburbs of the French capital, not far beyond the Paris ring road.</p>

<p>The man was holding "three or four employees" but there were no customers or members of the public among the hostages, a police source told AFP.</p>

<p>Police set up a security perimeter around the venue.</p>

<p>The man locked himself in the restaurant just before 1 pm local time (noon GMT), the source said. A mediator was dispatched to the scene.</p>

<p>"Intervention is in progress," the police prefecture wrote on X. "Let security and emergency services do their job."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Illegal immigration from Canada to the United States has seen a sharp rise among people of Indian origin, US border patrol data shows.</p>

<p>While the pipeline of illegal immigration from India has existed for a long time, it has increased significantly in the last few years, reports American news agency <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://apnews.com/article/immigration-canada-us-india-deaths-smuggling-trial-16946bb01a1d1ca2978f29e902e550fc" rel="No follow, no index" target="_blank">Associated Press</a>.</p>

<p>According to the US border patrol data cited in the report, more than 14,000 Indians have been arrested along the US-Canada border in the year ending September 30 - a staggering 10-fold rise in just two years. The arrests of persons of Indian origin amounted to 60 per cent of all arrests along the US-Canada border.</p>

<p>According to data revealed by the Pew Research Center, it is estimated that by 2022, there were already more than 725,000 Indians living illegally in the US - &nbsp;behind only Mexicans and El Salvadorans.</p>

<p>While greater research and analysis is required to understand why there is such a surge in illegal immigration from Canada to the US, it is understood that a combination of factors contribute to this, including political repression, a rise in Khalistan extremism in Canada which target Indians, a dysfunctional US immigration system, extremely long waits for visas and permits under the existing legal immigration system, and economic inequality.</p>

<p>But there is also a human rights angle - An incident in 2022 underscores the urgent need for effective immigration policies and increased awareness about the risks associated with illegal border crossings.</p>

<p>On a bitterly cold January night in 2022, Jagdish Patel, his wife Vaishaliben, and their two young children embarked on a perilous journey to cross the US-Canada border, seeking a better life.</p>

</div>

<p>Their dreams, however, were cruelly cut short. The family of four succumbed to the freezing temperatures, their bodies found in a snowy field, a heartbreaking testament to the human cost of illegal immigration.</p>

<p>The Patels' story began in Dingucha, a small village in western India's Gujarat state. Like many others, they were lured by the promise of a brighter future in the West. The village, once thriving, now has blocks of vacant homes, as many residents have left in search of greener pastures. The Patel family, comprising schoolteachers Jagdish and Vaishaliben, and their children, Vihangi (11) and Dharmik (3), were driven by the desire for economic prosperity.</p>

</div>

<p>Their journey was facilitated by Harshkumar Patel, an experienced smuggler nicknamed "Dirty Harry," and Steve Shand, a driver recruited by Patel. The two men, accused of being part of a sophisticated human smuggling operation, are set to stand trial on charges related to human smuggling.</p>

<p>On the fateful night, the Patels, along with seven other Indian migrants, attempted to cross the border on foot, braving temperatures as low as -36 degrees F (-38 degrees Celsius). The group, poorly equipped for the harsh conditions, became separated in the darkness. While seven survivors were eventually rescued, the Patel family perished, their bodies discovered the next morning.</p>

<p>The incident highlights the growing issue of illegal immigration from India, driven by economic aspirations and facilitated by smuggling networks.</p>

<p>Satveer Chaudhary, a Minneapolis-based immigration attorney, notes that smugglers often target vulnerable individuals, charging exorbitant fees and exploiting their desperation.</p>

<p>As the trial of Patel and Shand begins, the focus shifts to the human cost of illegal immigration. The Patel family's tragic fate serves as a poignant reminder of the dangers and uncertainties faced by those seeking a better life.</p>

<p>Hemant Shah, an Indian-born businessman who organized a virtual prayer service for the Patels, lamented the greed that drove the smuggling operation, stating, "There was no humanity."</p>

<p>Donald Trump is poised to make a significant impact on immigration policies from day one of his presidency, with plans to unleash a flurry of executive actions aimed at bolstering immigration enforcement and dismantling key Biden-era legal entry programs. This sweeping effort will be spearheaded by Tom Homan, Trump's newly appointed "border czar," alongside other prominent Republican immigration hardliners.</p>

<p>As the global community grapples with the complexities of migration, the memory of the Patel family serves as a heartbreaking reminder of the devastating consequences of desperation and exploitation.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[Indian student groups in the UK said the fall was to be expected amid limited job prospects and also safety concerns following recent anti-immigration riots in some cities.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Indian students are being put off applying to UK universities, adding to their financial woes at a time when education institutions are already coping with constrained budgets, a new report into the stability of the higher education sector in England has revealed.</p>

<p>Based on UK Home Office data on confirmation of acceptance for studies (CAS) by UK providers from 2022-23 to 2023-24, an Office for Students (OfS) analysis released on Friday shows a 20.4 per cent drop in Indian student numbers - down from 139,914 to 111,329.</p>

<p>Indian student groups in the UK said the fall was to be expected amid limited job prospects and also safety concerns following recent anti-immigration riots in some cities.</p>

<p>"There has been a considerable decline in student visa applications from prospective non-UK students in some major source countries," notes the report by OfS, a non-departmental public body of the government's Department for Education.</p>

<p>"This data shows an 11.8 per cent decline in the total number of sponsor acceptances issued to international students, as well as considerable variation for students with different nationalities, with the largest declines reported in the number of CAS issued to Indian and Nigerian students, down 28,585 (20.4 per cent) and 25,897 (44.6 per cent) respectively," it said.</p>

<p>It warns that universities with financial models that depend heavily on students from countries such as India, Nigeria and Bangladesh are likely to be significantly affected due to this downward trend.</p>

<p>"The number of international students from certain countries that send significant numbers to study in the UK has decreased significantly," OfS cautions.</p>

<p>"By 2025-26, based on current trends and not taking into account significant mitigating action, we estimate a net income reduction for the sector of GBP 3,445 million, and, without significant mitigating actions, a sector-level deficit of minus GBP 1,636 million, with up to 72 per cent of providers being in deficit, and 40 per cent having low liquidity," it adds.</p>

<p>The Indian National Students' Association (INSA) UK said it was not surprised with the significant decrease in students from India given the government's clampdown on foreign students being allowed to bring along their dependent partners and spouses.</p>

<p>"Students are not allowed to bring their partners to the UK under the new policy and given the economic conditions here and recent rioting stories, unless the government addresses this issue the outlook for UK universities is bleak as they rely heavily on Indian students," said INSA UK President Amit Tiwari.</p>

<p>Indians overtook the Chinese in recent years as the leading nationality granted study visas to the UK and are the largest cohort to access the Graduate Route post-study work visa, which was thrown into disarray due to a review which has since concluded it is here to stay.</p>

<p>"Many reasons contribute to the decline in numbers, including the Conservative ban on dependents, confusion around post-study work visa, increase in skilled worker salary thresholds and an apparent lack of jobs in the UK," said Sanam Arora, chair of the National Indian Students and Alumni Union (NISAU) UK.</p>

<p>"We discovered the scale of misinformation that continues to persist; for the first time, safety is also being raised as a concern... Universities need to ensure that they are communicating the UK offer adequately and at scale in India to address the confusions that persist," she said.</p>

<p>"Universities also need to invest significantly in their employability support in order to stay competitive and provide a wholesome, outcome-oriented offer for students," she added.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[The Starship rocket, capable of carrying up to 1,000 passengers, promises intercontinental travel at record speeds, such as 30 minutes from Delhi to San Francisco.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After Donald Trump was re-elected as the US President, billionaire Elon Musk, who is now set to co-lead the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) with Vivek Ramaswamy, announced that SpaceX's ambitious "Earth-to-Earth" space travel project would soon come to reality.</p>

<p>SpaceX's Starship rocket, which was first proposed almost ten years ago and is said to be the most powerful in the world, would enable intercontinental travel at previously unprecedented speeds.</p>

<p>According to a report by the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-14073021/SpaceX-Starship-Elon-Musk-possible-Trump.html"><em>Daily Mail, </em></a>the Starship could transport up to 1,000 passengers per trip, flying in orbit parallel to Earth's surface rather than venturing into deep space. Projected travel times are groundbreaking: Los Angeles to Toronto in 24 minutes, London to New York in 29 minutes, Delhi to San Francisco in 30 minutes, and New York to Shanghai in 39 minutes.</p>

<p>The concept has recently gained momentum on social media, with user @ajtourville sharing a promotional video of the project on X (formerly Twitter).</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Under Trump's FAA, <a href="https://twitter.com/SpaceX?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@SpaceX</a> could even get Starship Earth to Earth approved in a few years — Taking people from any city to any other city on Earth in under one hour. <a href="https://t.co/vgYAzg8oaB">pic.twitter.com/vgYAzg8oaB</a></p>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>The post speculated that the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) might greenlight the initiative under a potential second Trump administration.</p>

<p>Elon Musk reacted to this post and wrote, "This is now possible."</p>

<p>As public interest grows, Musk's vision of ultra-fast travel could redefine global connectivity, making it possible to cross continents in minutes.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A reactor at the Onagawa nuclear plant in Miyagi Prefecture, northeastern Japan, has resumed power generation for the first time since the Fukushima nuclear disaster in March 2011, its operator said.</p>

<p>Tohoku Electric Power Company said that the Onagawa No. 2 reactor restarted power generation at 6 p.m. local time on Friday. After an adjustment operation to check for any abnormalities while gradually increasing output, the reactor will be temporarily halted for equipment checks, reports Xinhua news agency.</p>

<p>The reactor is expected to start full commercial operation in December, it added.</p>

<p>The 825,000-kilowatt reactor, if operated at about 70 per cent of its capacity for one year, is estimated to generate electricity equivalent to the power consumption of 1.62 million households, according to Tohoku Electric.</p>

<p>The No. 2 reactor was reactivated on October 29 but was halted on November 4 after an issue was found with a measurement device. After the problem was fixed, the reactor was restarted again on Wednesday.</p>

<p>The three reactors at the Onagawa plant are of the same boiling water type as those at Tokyo Electric Power Company's Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, where the country's worst nuclear accident was triggered by the massive earthquake and tsunami on March 11, 2011.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russia is solely responsible for preventing a fair settlement to end the war in Ukraine, the G7 said on Saturday, in a statement marking 1,000 days of the Russian invasion.</p>

<p>"Russia remains the sole obstacle to just and lasting peace," the Group of Seven industrialised nations, of which Italy holds the rotating presidency, said in a statement.</p>

<p>The G7, which also comprises Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Japan and the United States, confirmed "its commitment to imposing severe costs on Russia through sanctions, export controls and other effective measures".</p>

<p>It expressed "unwavering support for Ukraine for as long as it takes", adding: "We stand in solidarity contributing to its fight for sovereignty, freedom, independence, territorial integrity and its reconstruction. We recognise, too, the impact of Russia's aggression on vulnerable people across the world."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Saturday he would like to end the war with Russia next year through "diplomatic means".</p>

<p>He spoke a day after saying he expected the conflict to end sooner than it would otherwise have done, once Donald Trump takes office in the United States next year.</p>

<p>"For our part, we must do everything we can to ensure that this war ends next year. We have to end it by diplomatic means," Zelensky said in an interview with Ukrainian radio. "And this, I think, is very important."</p>

<p>There have been no meaningful talks between Russia and Ukraine, but a Trump presidency raises questions about the future of the conflict, with the Republican repeatedly saying he would end the war swiftly.</p>

<p>"We have to understand what the Russians want," Zelensky said.</p>

<p>Referring to Ukraine, he said: "You are at war with a state that does not value its people, that has a lot of equipment, that does not care how many people die."</p>

<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has said he will only accept talks with Ukraine if Kyiv surrenders Ukrainian territory that Moscow occupies.</p>

<p>The Kremlin said he repeated that demand in a phone conversation with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Friday.</p>

<p>Zelensky has rejected Putin's conditions.</p>

<p>Moscow has made steady advances in eastern Ukraine since this summer, inching closer to key hubs such as Pokrovsk and Kurakhove.</p>

<p>Zelensky said on Saturday that Russian forces were suffering heavy losses and that the adance had "slowed down" in some areas.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>New Zealand's youngest MP, Hana-Rawhiti Maipi-Clarke, on Thursday tore up a copy of the contentious Treaty Principles Bill and <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/new-zealand-mp-hana-rawhiti-kareariki-maipi-clarke-leads-traditional-dance-rips-up-copy-of-bill-in-parliament-7020108">performed a traditional Maori haka</a> during a House session. This bold move comes almost a year after she went viral for performing a haka during her maiden speech in parliament. The 22-year-old Te Pati Maori MP interrupted the session, ripping apart the bill before breaking into the powerful dance. She was soon joined by others in the public gallery, prompting Speaker Gerry Brownlee to briefly suspend the House.</p>

<p><strong>The Maori Haka</strong></p>

<p>The Maori <a href="https://www.newzealand.com/int/feature/haka/ " rel="nofollow,noindex">haka</a> is a traditional performance that holds deep cultural significance for New Zealanders. It is known for its powerful energy, fierce facial expressions (pukana), and physical movements like stamping, hand gestures, and chanting. The haka varies by region, with many telling stories of significant events in a tribe's history.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Origins and significance</strong></p>

<p>The haka's origins lie in Maori mythology, created by Tane-more, the son of the sun god and the summer maid. It symbolises vitality and energy, representing the spirit of the Maori people. Traditionally, the haka was performed for war, to celebrate achievements, or to welcome guests. Today, it is performed at important occasions like sporting events, weddings, and funerals.</p>

<p><strong>Types of Haka</strong></p>

<p>There are various forms of haka, each with its unique purpose:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Peruperu: A war haka performed with weapons to show strength.</li>
	<li>Ngarahu: A semi-war dance performed to test warriors' readiness.</li>
	<li>Haka Tui Waewae: A non-combative haka expressing emotions like joy or anger.</li>
	<li>Ka Mate: Created by Ngati Toa Chief Te Rauparaha, Ka Mate tells the story of his escape from capture and his subsequent rise as a great Maori leader.</li>
</ul>

<p>The haka gained worldwide fame through New Zealand's All Blacks rugby team, who perform Ka Mate before each game. The performance is meant to assert dominance, energise the team, and honour Maori culture. This ritual has captivated audiences globally.</p>

<p>To experience haka firsthand, you can attend rugby matches or visit places like Rotorua where you can watch live performances or participate in traditional Maori experiences.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Joe Biden meets Chinese president Xi Jinping for the last time as US president on Saturday, but the leaders' goal of lowering tensions before Donald Trump's inauguration is challenged by fresh conflicts over cyber crime, trade, Taiwan and Russia.</p>

<p>Biden and Xi will huddle on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Lima, Peru -- for their first talks in seven months -- where Pacific Rim leaders are assessing the implications of Trump's return to power as US president on Jan. 20. The time of their meeting has not been disclosed.</p>

<p>Washington is incensed by a recent China-linked hack of the telephone communications of US government and presidential campaign officials, and it is anxious about increasing pressure by Beijing on Taiwan and Chinese support for Russia.</p>

<p>Taiwan President Lai Ching-te is planning to stop in the US state of Hawaii and maybe Guam on a sensitive visit that is sure to anger Beijing in the coming weeks, Reuters reported on Friday. China views democratically governed Taiwan as its own territory. The US is Taiwan's most important international backer and arms supplier, despite the lack of formal diplomatic recognition.</p>

<p>At the same time, Beijing's economy is taking a stiff hit from Biden's steps on trade, including a plan to restrict US investment in Chinese artificial intelligence, quantum computing and semiconductors and export restrictions on high-end computer chips. All of those topics are expected to figure into the talks, US officials said.</p>

<p>China routinely denies US hacking allegations, regards Taiwan as internal matter and has protested American statements on Sino-Russian trade. A spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington declined to comment.</p>

<p><strong>BLANKET TARIFFS</strong></p>

<p>Trump has vowed to adopt blanket 60% tariffs on US imports of Chinese goods as part of a package of "America First" trade measures. Beijing opposes those steps. The Republican president-elect also plans to hire several hawkish voices on China in senior roles, including US Senator Marco Rubio as secretary of state and Representative Mike Waltz as national security adviser.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, Biden national security adviser Jake Sullivan described the transition as "a time when competitors and adversaries can see possibly opportunity." Biden will stress with Xi the "need to maintain stability, clarity, predictability through this transition between the United States and China."</p>

<p>Shen Dingli, a Shanghai-based international relations scholar, said China wants the meeting to ease tensions during the transition period. "China definitely does not want relations with the United States to be thrown into turmoil before Trump formally takes office," said Shen.</p>

<p>The summit in South America offers new signs of the challenges to the United States' power in its own backyard, where China is on a charm offensive.</p>

<p>Xi, who arrived in Lima on Thursday, plans a week-long diplomatic blitz in Latin America that includes a refurbished free-trade agreement with Peru, inaugurating the massive Chancay deep-water port there and being welcomed in Brazil's capital next week for a state visit.</p>

<p>China is seeking Latin America's metal ores, soybeans, and other commodities, but US officials worry they may also be looking for new US-adjacent military and intelligence outposts. Chinese state-backed media has called those accusations a smear.</p>

<p>A US official said Washington's commitment to the region was strong and that Chinese infrastructure investment overseas has declined in recent years due to domestic challenges and problems with the projects.</p>

<p>But Ryan Berg, director of the Americas Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank, said Xi would meet with a good reception in the region.</p>

<p>"Biden's trip will be overshadowed very clearly by all of the things that Xi Jinping will be up to when he visits APEC," he said. "When Xi meets with Biden part of his audience is not - it's not solely the White House or the US government. It's about American CEOs and continued US investment or trying to renew US investment in China and get rid of the perception that there's a hostile business environment in China."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">A 20-year-old US man is facing severe charges after allegedly throwing his eight-month-old son against a wall in frustration while playing a video game. Jalin White is charged with physical abuse of a child and neglect causing great bodily harm following the incident on November 5, <a href="https://www.fox6now.com/news/milwaukee-man-accused-throwing-baby-while-playing-video-game" rel="nofollow,noindex">Fox News</a> reported.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">According to <a href="https://fox11online.com/news/state/baby-severely-injured-after-being-thrown-by-milwaukee-man-while-playing-video-games-jalin-white-childrens-wisconsin-hospital-pulse-skull-fracture-hemorrahage-abuse-brain-injury " rel="nofollow,noindex">court documents</a>, police were called to Children's Wisconsin hospital to investigate after the child was admitted with life-threatening injuries. Prosecutors said that the child, who suffered extensive injuries, is not expected to survive.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Medical professionals reported that the infant had a large skull fracture, brain haemorrhage, and multiple rib and clavicle fractures at various stages of healing. A craniectomy was performed to relieve pressure on the baby's brain, but the prognosis remains grim.</p>

<p dir="ltr">“This is likely going to become a homicide,” said Milwaukee Assistant District Attorney Madeline Witte during White's court appearance. “This is a severe level of violence for an innocent infant child, which had multiple injuries,” as per <a href="https://www.live5news.com/2024/11/13/father-allegedly-threw-infant-against-wall-after-becoming-frustrated-with-video-game/ " rel="nofollow,noindex">Live5 News</a>.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The criminal complaint outlines that White admitted to throwing the child during an intense gaming session of ‘NBA 2K'. Jalin White told investigators he was losing the game and became frustrated.</p>

<p dir="ltr">“He was getting heavy in my arms,” White said, according to the complaint, before describing how he threw the baby against a wall and onto a bed. The child struck the wall about a foot above the bed and landed face-first.</p>

<p dir="ltr">“I heard the wall. It was hard on his head. It was hard. It was a loud, hard wall,” White confessed to detectives.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Prosecutors revealed that the child's rib injuries suggest prior abuse, indicating this was not an isolated incident.</p>

<p dir="ltr">“If the child does die, prosecutors will upgrade the charges to homicide,” attorney Witte confirmed. If convicted of the current charges, Jalin White faces up to 62 years in prison, a sentence that could increase with a homicide conviction.</p>

<p dir="ltr">During the hearing, White shook his head as the court commissioner outlined the allegations and evidence, ordering his $100,000 cash bail.</p>

<p dir="ltr">“This incident reflects a tragic and senseless act of violence against a vulnerable infant,” the court commissioner added.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Authorities are monitoring the child's condition. White is being held on a $100,000 cash bond.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iran's foreign ministry spokesman on Saturday "categorically" denied The New York Times report on Tehran's ambassador to the United Nations meeting with US tech billionaire Elon Musk, state media reported.</p>

<p>In an interview with state news agency IRNA, spokesman Esmaeil Baghaei was reported as "categorically denying such a meeting" and expressing "surprise at the coverage of the American media in this regard".</p>

<p>The Times reported on Friday that Musk, who is a close ally of President-elect Donald Trump, met earlier this week with Iran's ambassador to the UN, Amir Saeid Iravani.</p>

<p>It cited anonymous Iranian sources describing the encounter as "positive".</p>

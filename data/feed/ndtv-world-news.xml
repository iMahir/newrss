       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President Volodymyr Zelensky said Thursday he was confident Ukraine would eventually join NATO after the alliance said the Russian-invaded country had an "irreversible" path to membership.</p>

<p>"We have strong wording regarding the irreversibility of Ukraine's movement towards NATO. Every step truly brings us closer to membership," Zelensky told a news conference at a NATO summit alongside the alliance's chief Jens Stoltenberg.</p>

<p>"We are doing and will continue to do everything to ensure that the day comes when Ukraine is invited and becomes a NATO member, and I am confident we will achieve this," he said.</p>

<p>Zelensky's reaction was significantly warmer than a year ago at the NATO summit in Lithuania where he was visibly upset that there was not a firmer promise on membership.</p>

<p>NATO, formed in the Cold War, is a collective defense pact in which an attack on one ally is an attack on all.</p>

<p>The United States and Germany have led concerns about quickly bringing Ukraine into NATO, believing it would effectively put them at war with nuclear-armed Russia.</p>

<p>A declaration issued Wednesday at the 75th anniversary NATO summit in Washington said leaders supported Ukraine on "its irreversible path to full Euro-Atlantic integration, including NATO membership."</p>

<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has cited Ukraine's NATO aspirations as a reason to attack the former Soviet republic, rejecting the idea that the country has a separate historical identity.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russia on Thursday added opposition figure Yulia Navalnaya to its list of "terrorists" and "extremists," two days after it issued an arrest warrant for the exiled dissident.</p>

<p>Navalnaya has vowed to continue the work of her husband Alexei Navalny, Russian leader Vladimir Putin's main opponent who died in an Arctic prison in unclear circumstances in February.</p>

<p>Her personal details appeared Thursday in an online blacklist maintained by Rosfinmonitoring, a state agency designed to combat the financing of people and organisations Moscow deems "terrorists" or involved in "extremist activity".</p>

<p>Russian officials frequently apply such labels to opposition figures and those who campaign against the Kremlin or its offensive on Ukraine.</p>

<p>Navalny's organisations were outlawed in Russia and are labelled "extremist".</p>

<p>The opposition leader himself was sentenced to 19 years in prison on charges of "extremism."</p>

<p>A court in the capital Moscow on Tuesday ordered Navalnaya arrested in absentia, also on charges of "extremism."</p>

<p>Following her husband's death, Navalnaya, 47, vowed to take up his work and has lobbied against Putin's government from abroad.</p>

<p>"If they're making such a fuss, then Yulia is doing everything right," Kira Yarmysh, Navalnaya's press secretary said on social media after she was added to the blacklist.</p>

<p>Navalnaya, an economist, stood by her husband as he galvanised mass protests in Russia, flying him out of the country when he was poisoned before defiantly returning to Moscow with him in 2021, knowing he would be jailed.</p>

<p>Like much of Russia's opposition, Navalnaya lives in exile and would be detained if she set foot in Russia.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Taiwan's defence ministry said Thursday it had detected 66 Chinese military aircraft around the island in a 24-hour window, a record-high this year, a day after it said Beijing was conducting exercises in nearby waters.</p>

<p>China -- which maintains a near-daily military presence around Taiwan -- claims the self-ruled island as part of its territory and has said it will never renounce the use of force to bring it under its control.</p>

<p>Thursday's record comes a day after Taipei spotted Chinese aircraft around the island that it said were headed to the western Pacific for exercises with the PLA aircraft carrier Shandong.</p>

<p>"66 PLA aircraft and seven PLAN vessels operating around Taiwan were detected up until 6 am (2200 GMT Wednesday) today," the defence ministry said in Thursday's statement, adding it has "responded accordingly".</p>

<p>Fifty-six of the Chinese aircraft crossed the sensitive median line bisecting the Taiwan Strait -- a narrow 180-kilometre (110-mile) waterway separating the island from China.</p>

<p>An illustration it released showed some of the aircraft came within 33 nautical miles (61 kilometres) of Taiwan's southern tip.</p>

<p>The year's previous record was in May, when Beijing sent 62 military aircraft and 27 naval vessels around Taiwan.</p>

<p>That occurred in the middle of war games Beijing launched on the heels of the inauguration of Taiwan President Lai Ching-te, who Beijing regards as a "dangerous separatist".</p>

<p>Military expert Su Tzu-yun said China's latest show of force was a reaction to recent political developments, including Washington's new de facto ambassador to Taiwan meeting with and expressing support for Taipei during a meeting with Lai on Wednesday.</p>

<p>"Beijing puts pressure on Taiwan in order to express its displeasure at the support it enjoys," said Su of Taiwan's Institute for National Defence and Security Research.</p>

<p>Defence minister Wellington Koo on Wednesday noted that the Shandong had not passed "through the Bashi Channel", the area off Taiwan's southern tip where Chinese ships typically transit en route to the Pacific Ocean.</p>

<p>Instead, it "went further south through the Balintang Channel towards the Western Pacific," he said, referring to a waterway just north of the Philippines' Babuyan Island -- about 250 kilometres south of Bashi.</p>

<p>Neighbouring Japan on Tuesday confirmed that four PLA navy vessels -- including the Shandong -- were sailing 520 kilometres southeast of Miyako island.</p>

<p>The Philippines' military public affairs chief said they had received reports of a China-Russia exercise taking place in the Philippine Sea but did not comment about the Shandong directly.</p>

<p><strong>'Restricted waters'</strong></p>

<p>China has in recent years ramped up political and military pressures around Taiwan, sending in record-breaking numbers of jets, drones and ships while upping the rhetoric of "unification" being "inevitable".</p>

<p>Lin Jian, spokesman of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, reiterated Thursday that "Taiwan is an inalienable part of China's territory".</p>

<p>"The determination and resolve of the Chinese people to safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity are unwavering," he said during a regular press briefing.</p>

<p>The largest number of aircraft ever seen around Taiwan came last September when Beijing sent in 103 warplanes and aircraft.</p>

<p>Experts call these "grey zone tactics", which stop short of outright acts of war but serve to exhaust the island's military.</p>

<p>Lai has repeatedly made overtures of dialogue to China, but has been largely rebuffed.</p>

<p>Besides deploying a military show of force, China has also increasingly sent coast guard ships around Taiwan's outlying islands this year.</p>

<p>On Thursday, four Chinese coast guard ships "sailed into (Taiwan's) waters" at 7 am, Taipei's coast guard said, adding that the vessels left after two hours.</p>

<p>Then at 10 am, the four ships "once again sailed in Kinmen's restricted waters at multiple points, and our patrol boats immediately moved forward to monitor", and they left around noon.</p>

<p>"So far this year the incursions into waters controlled by our side have reached 31 times," they said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United States foiled a Russian plot earlier this year to assassinate the chief executive of a major German arms maker supplying weaponry to Ukraine, CNN reported on Thursday.</p>

<p>The US cable television network, citing five unidentified US and Western officials, said the United States informed Germany of the Russian government's plan to kill Armin Papperger, the head of Rheinmetall, and he was given protection by German security services.</p>

<p>It said the assassination plot was one of a series of Russian plans discovered by US intelligence to kill European defense industry executives supporting Ukraine's war effort.</p>

<p>Rheinmetall produces 155mm artillery shells and plans to begin manufacturing armored vehicles in Ukraine, according to CNN.</p>

<p>The CNN report comes as NATO leaders are holding meetings in Washington to mark the 75th anniversary of the defense bloc.</p>

<p>German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said: "In view of the latest reports on Rhinmetall, this is what we have actually been communicating more and more clearly in recent months.</p>

<p>"Russia is waging a hybrid war of aggression," Baerbock said. "With sabotage, with cyber attacks, with the paralysis of GPS so that Baltic aircraft can no longer land in neighbouring countries.</p>

<p>"We have seen that there have been attacks on people on European territory," the foreign minister said. "We have seen that there have been attacks on factories.</p>

<p>"And this emphasizes once again that we as Europeans must protect ourselves as best we can and not be naive."</p>

<p>A German interior ministry spokesman declined to comment directly on the Rheinmetall report but said the "German government takes the threats from the Russian regime very seriously.</p>

<p>"Our security authorities are very vigilant and act accordingly, in close cooperation with our international partners," the spokesman said. "We cannot comment on details, concrete protection measures and intelligence findings."</p>

<p>Rheinmetall spokesman Oliver Hoffmann said the company was "unable to comment on issues relating to corporate security."</p>

<p>"The necessary measures are always taken in regular consultation with security authorities," Hoffmann added.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Embattled US President Joe Biden's campaign released a new advertisement on Thursday, hitting out at his rival and former president Donald Trump for "siding with Putin," and calling him a "lap dog for a dictator." The advertisement - released to coincide with the last day of this week's high-profile NATO summit here - is part of a larger USD 50 million paid media buy for July, ahead of the November 5 presidential election.</p>

<p>The ad also comes as Biden, 81, faces a huge task to reassure fellow Democrats and voters about his fitness for office following a disastrous debate performance against 78-year-old Trump.</p>

<p>The advertisement slams Trump for suggesting Russia "do whatever the hell they want" to NATO members who do not meet defence spending targets, warning that the Republican Party's presumptive candidate is "a lapdog for a dictator who blames 'America first.'" "Donald Trump is an unhinged wannabe dictator. If he's reelected, he'll be Vladimir Putin's lap dog, giving him the green light to steamroll Europe and potentially spark World War III," CNN quoted Biden campaign spokesperson Lauren Hitt as saying on Thursday.</p>

<p>"Democracy and American security are on the ballot this November, and President Biden is the only candidate in this race committed to protecting and promoting it at home and abroad," it said.</p>

<p>Congressional Democrats are worried about Biden's chances to win reelection, particularly in the wake of his disastrous debate on CNN last month, and that having him at the top of the ticket could also hurt the party in the election.</p>

<p>Most Democrats have been reluctant to publicly call on Biden to step aside, but a growing number are saying so out loud, even after Biden has gone on the offensive this week to shore up support for a second term in the White House.</p>

<p>Biden wrote to congressional Democrats on Monday that he will continue his reelection bid despite mounting concerns.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Biden is scheduled to hold a closely watched news conference on Thursday at the end of the Nato summit, marking another high-stakes moment for him to show off his skill in answering questions in an unscripted setting.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The BRICS could establish their own parliament in the future, Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday.</p>

<p>"Thus far, BRICS does not have its own institutionalised parliamentary structure. But I believe that in the future this idea will definitely be realised," he said, in his address at the tenth parliamentary forum of the bloc here, RT reported.</p>

<p>He also said events such as the group's parliamentary forum strengthen the influence of BRICS on global affairs and help "make the world safer and more harmonious".</p>

<p>The Russian President stated that, by acting together, the recently-expanded group would be able to unlock its potential in economic, investment, and technology cooperation.</p>

<p>The group's priorities include the achievement of "positive changes" in the world economy through the development of reliable financial instruments for settling payments within BRICS, he said.</p>

<p>Noting that the number of participants had increased this year, he said Russia, as the current chair of the group, would ramp up efforts to ensure that the four new members of the bloc were effectively integrated following their accession earlier this year.</p>

<p>BRICS was founded in 2006 by Brazil, Russia, India, and China, with South Africa joining in 2011. The group expanded this year when Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, and the United Arab Emirates became full members.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Israeli military published on Thursday the findings of a first probe into its own security failings during the devastating Oct. 7 Hamas attack, acknowledging it hadn't protected the citizens of one of the worst hit communities, Kibbutz Be'eri.</p>

<p>More than 100 people were killed in the attack on Be'eri, a community of about 1,000 people, and 32 taken hostage to Gaza, 11 of whom are still there.</p>

<p>The probe examined the day's chain of events, fighting and security forces' conduct, the military said. Some of the details have already been revealed by Reuters and other media in the weeks after the attack.</p>

<p>While acknowledging its own failure in protecting the kibbutz civilians, the military hailed the bravery of Be'eri residents, including its rapid response team, who despite being vastly outnumbered, tried to repel the militants who invaded.</p>

<p>Israel's military was unprepared for the scenario of a massive infiltration of militants into Israel, had inadequate forces in the area, did not have a clear picture of the events until noon, a few hours after the attack began, did not properly alert Be'eri's residents and its fighting was uncoordinated, the investigation found.</p>

<p>The probe, however, did not find fault in tank fire toward a house where militants were holding some 15 people hostage, an incident that has drawn criticism in Israel for having put civilians in harms way.</p>

<p>"After shooting was heard from the house and the terrorists announced their intent to kill themselves and the hostages, the forces decided to storm it in order to save the hostages," the military's summary said.</p>

<p>"The team found that the civilians inside the house were not hurt by the tank shells," the summary said, however, further investigation is needed to determine how hostages inside died, with signs pointing to them having been killed by the gunmen.</p>

<p>The military presented the report to Be'eri's residents, many of whom are among the tens of thousands of Israelis still displaced since Oct. 7.</p>

<p>"I didn't need all these details," said Miri Gad Mesika, a kibbutz member. "What matters to me is why what happened happened, how we can prevent it from happening again, how we can bring back our hostages and how we can feel secure again."</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Shelley Duvall, the versatile actor known for her role in "The Shining" and collaboration with director Robert Altman, died Thursday aged 75.</p>

<p>Citing her partner Dan Gilroy, The Hollywood Reporter said Duvall died in her sleep at her home in Blanco, Texas following complications of diabetes.</p>

<p>Born July 7, 1949 in Fort Worth, Texas, Duvall was discovered by Altman -- the maverick filmmaker known for his rich characters, sharp social criticism and keen satire -- who cast her in 1970's dark comedy "Brewster McCloud."</p>

<p>The saucer-eyed actor developed a broad repertoire and captivated audiences, breaking through with 1975's "Nashville," and going on to portray memorable and eccentric characters that earned her a smattering of awards including at Cannes for her role in the acclaimed 1977 drama "3 Women."</p>

<p>Her career was defined by her work with Altman, who she said she kept coming back to because "he offers me damn good roles."</p>

<p>"None of them have been alike," she told The New York Times in 1977.</p>

<p>"He has a great confidence in me, and a trust and respect for me, and he doesn't put any restrictions on me or intimidate me, and I love him."</p>

<p>In a 1977 interview Altman praised Duvall for being able "to swing all sides of the pendulum: charming, silly, sophisticated, pathetic -- even beautiful."</p>

<p><strong>'She's free'</strong></p>

<p>But it was her work on the 1980 film adaptation of Stephen King's "The Shining" that would become her highest profile role, which she played opposite Jack Nicholson.</p>

<p>Director Stanley Kubrick put her through the ringer to perform the part of Wendy Torrance in the horror classic that sees a writer husband descend into homicidal madness and terrorize his wife and young son.</p>

<p>Duvall has voiced admiration for Kubrick but also has publicly discussed how arduous the role was, telling People in 1981 the 13-month job was grueling and that Kubrick had her "crying 12 hours a day for weeks on end."</p>

<p>"I will never give that much again. If you want to get into pain and call it art, go ahead, but not with me."</p>

<p>In one famous scene Nicholson's character tortures Duvall's with a baseball bat, which reportedly took 127 takes to satisfy Kubrick.</p>

<p>Duvall also made a cameo in 1977's "Annie Hall" by Woody Allen, and played opposite Robin Williams in Altman's 1980 live-action rendition of "Popeye."</p>

<p>Later in the 1980s she made her way into children's programming.</p>

<p>Her last film was 2023's "The Forest Hills," an independent horror-thriller she played in after a two-decade hiatus from professional acting.</p>

<p>Duvall's fade from Hollywood prompted much speculation, over both her mental health and her aged appearance. In a 2024 interview with The New York Times both she and Gilroy voiced exasperation at such treatment.</p>

<p>She indicated she felt betrayed by the industry in which she excelled, even as her body of work continues to earn her new fans.</p>

<p>"I was a star; I had leading roles," she said in the rare interview. "People think it's just aging, but it's not. It's violence."</p>

<p>"How would you feel if people were really nice, and then, suddenly, on a dime... they turn on you?"</p>

<p>Gilroy -- a musician who was part of the Breakfast Club band and had dated Madonna -- was Duvall's longtime partner after the pair met on the 1990 Disney Channel Movie "Mother Goose Rock 'n' Rhyme."</p>

<p>"My dear, sweet, wonderful life partner and friend left us. Too much suffering lately, now she's free. Fly away, beautiful Shelley," Gilroy said in a widely published statement.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Scores of whales washed ashore in a "mass stranding" in Scotland's Orkney archipelago on Thursday, a British marine life rescue charity said.</p>

<p>A total of 77 long-finned pilot whales were found on the island of Sanday in Orkney, off the northeastern coast of Scotland, after the British Divers Marine Life Rescue (BDMLR) received a report.</p>

<p>When the BDMLR arrived, only a dozen whales were still alive, having been "stranded for several hours already", the animal rescue charity said.</p>

<p>First aid was being provided to the surviving animals as the "incoming tide approaches them", it added.</p>

<p>"Our team continues to work hard to manage this incredibly difficult situation", BDMLR said in the statement on its website, adding that help was also coming from the Scottish Marine Animal Strandings Scheme to probe the incident.</p>

<p>While such mass strandings are not uncommon among pilot whales who tend to travel in tightly-knit groups, this one is larger than in previous years.</p>

<p>Last year, 55 pilot whales washed ashore and died on the island of Lewis, off northwest Scotland.</p>

<p>Much bigger strandings have taken place in other parts of the world, with the largest in parts of New Zealand and Australia.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a shocking incident, Hawaii Airport in the United States was evacuated after grenades were found in a carry-on luggage of a man, as per a report in CBS News. The Transportation Security Administration said that they found two items resembling grenades were detected during x-ray screening in a bag belonging to a male Japanese national departing the country.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, officers emptied the terminal as the bomb squad investigated the suspicious items discovered during X-ray scanning. The police said, "The Hilo International Airport experienced a brief halt in operations" for a little over an hour.</p>

<p>According to police, the bomb squad "determined the items to be inert grenades," meaning they posed no threat. As per the authorities, Akito Fukushima, of Kanazawa, Japan, was taken into custody on a charge of first-degree terroristic threats.</p>

<p>"Responding to the 5:44 a.m. call, officers secured and evacuated the terminal area as a precautionary safety measure while the department's bomb squad arrived on scene and determined the items to be inert grenades. At 6:45 a.m., police arrested 41-year-old Akito Fukushima of Kanazawa, Japan, for first-degree terroristic threatening. Fukushima was transported to HPD's East Hawaii Detention Facility and remains in custody while Detectives of the Area I Criminal Investigation Section continue the investigation. The airport resumed operations at 6:50 a.m," the Hawaii Police Department in a press release.</p>

<p>The flight he was trying to board was to a destination outside the US, police noted, however, they didn't say which country it was heading to or what his ultimate destination was. "Police remind the public that replicas of explosives, such as hand grenades, are prohibited in checked and carry-on baggage," they said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[She received medical assistance at the airport before being transferred to a local hospital for further treatment.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An elderly woman on a Cathay Pacific flight bound for London was hurt when a piece of luggage fell from an overhead compartment and hit her on the head. According to the <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/society/article/3269682/passenger-hong-kong-london-cathay-flight-injured-after-hand-baggage-falls-and-hits-her-head">South China Morning Post</a></em>, the incident happened on Monday night as the flight was leaving Hong Kong International Airport for London Heathrow Airport.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Police were notified at 11:22 PM on Monday that a 76-year-old passenger had sustained a head injury on the flight.&nbsp;She received medical assistance at the airport before being transferred to North Lantau Hospital for further treatment.</p>

<p>Due to the accident, the flight was delayed for nearly an hour.&nbsp;Originally scheduled to depart at 11:15 p.m. on Monday, the flight finally took off at 12:06 a.m. on Tuesday.</p>

<p>According to a Cathay Pacific spokesman, the woman's injury may have been caused by improperly stored items in the overhead compartment. The airline ensured that the passenger and her family were given hotel accommodations and rebooked flights to Heathrow, the <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/cathay-pacific-passenger-hospitalised-cabin-bag-injury-overhead-b2577192.html">Independent</a></em> reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A spokesperson for Cathay Pacific said: ''The reason for the injury could be down to a misplaced item of luggage in the overhead storage compartment. Our cabin crew and ground staff immediately called for assistance, sent the passenger to a nearby hospital for further medical care, cancelled the flight for the passenger and her family members, and arranged for the family members to stay at an airport hotel.''</p>

<p>''We take the issue of passenger safety very seriously. We are sorry for the incident and sincerely wish the passenger a speedy recovery. Our team will follow up and provide assistance to the passenger's family,'' the spokesperson added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Notably, airlines are usually liable for injuries sustained by passengers, unless they can demonstrate that the injury resulted from the passenger's own negligence. In this case, the woman may be eligible to seek compensation from Cathay Pacific under Article 17 of the Montreal Convention, which holds airlines liable for injuries and deaths sustained by passengers during flights, boarding and disembarkation.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A New York based AI research company that focuses on biotechnology has generated a novel protein using a Protein Language Model (ProLLMs) that works on the similar transformer architecture as that of ChatGPT.&nbsp;</p>

<p>EvolutionaryScale unveiled a first of its kind AI generated new protein molecule that glows- mimicking the bioluminescence of a jellyfish molecule called green fluorescent protein- on 25 June. The novel protein sequence is significantly different (less than 60 percent resemblance) to the natural protein: a difference dubbed to be possible "over 500 million years of (natural) evolution" by the company.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The company used its frontier AI language model called EvolutionaryScale Model-3 (ESM3) to achieve this feat and secured 142 million dollars in a seed funding round for the same, including investments from industry giants like Nvidia and Amazon.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>The ESM3 differs from ChatGPT as it is trained on parameters (internal variables) of three fundamental biological properties of proteins - sequence, structure and functions. The model was trained on 98 billion parameters, making it the biggest biological AI model till date.&nbsp;</p>

<p>EvolutionaryScale dubs this as a "model trained across all of evolution." The training set comprised 2.78 billion natural proteins, ranging from "the Amazon rainforest, to the depths of ocean, extreme environments like hydrothermal vents, and microbes in a handful of soil."</p>

<p>ESM3 lets users generate proteins, using prompts with partial information (sequence, structure, and function keywords) and iterating the model to make predictions until the entire sequence is completed. The model is primarily meant for scientists and gives them unprecedented control over the process of generating proteins.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-media-max-width="560">

<p>EvolutionaryScale states their objective is to make biology programmable. "ESM3 takes a step towards the future where AI is a tool to engineer biology from first principles in the same way we engineer structures, machines and microchips, and write computer programs," states the company website.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The application of this technology can lead to breakthroughs in multiple fields like drug discovery and development, biomedical research as well as sustainability- an example of which is already demonstrated by EvolutionaryScale by showcasing a protein prototype that is capable of degrading plastic waste.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The possibilities are endless, with every cell in every organism containing ribosomes (protein complexes that are responsible for protein synthesis). However, there have also been concerns that AI might be misused for creating biological weapons.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Scientists have taken a proactive approach and laid down "Community Values, Guiding Principles, and Commitments for the Responsible Development of AI for Protein Design" in March, seeking to guide the developments in this domain for the betterment of humanity.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">We're advancing a new global agreement signed by 100+ leading scientists to ensure AI technologies for protein design are developed responsibly.

<p>&nbsp;<br />
EvolutionaryScale has also been praised by experts for releasing a smaller open-source version for others to use freely. The large-scale complete model has not been released, although the training process of the same has been made public, in an attempt to remain transparent and share the technology freely.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[An anti-terrorism court in Pakistan on Thursday said the actions of jailed former prime minister Imran Khan were similar to that of a "terrorist" in a case linked to the May 9 violence.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An anti-terrorism court in Pakistan on Thursday said the actions of jailed former prime minister Imran Khan were similar to that of a "terrorist" in a case linked to the May 9 violence. The court ruled that he had delegated the task of attacking military installations, government properties, and police officials to party leaders to exert pressure for his release.</p>

<p>The 71-year-old PTI founder and hundreds of his party colleagues are being tried under multiple cases, including one under the Official Secrets Act in connection with the May 9, 2023, violent protests by his supporters that damaged key military installations across Pakistan. The unprecedented protests erupted across Pakistan on May 9 last year after Mr Khan was arrested in an alleged corruption case.</p>

<p>Mr Khan's party workers allegedly vandalised a dozen military installations, including the Jinnah House (Lahore Corps Commander House), Mianwali Airbase and the ISI building in Faisalabad. The Army headquarters (GHQ) in Rawalpindi too was attacked by the mob for the first time.</p>

<p>Mr Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party termed the anti-terrorism court's ruling an "absurd order" and declared that it would launch a protest.</p>

<p>The anti-terrorism court (ATC) at Lahore had earlier this week dismissed pre-arrest bail to Mr Khan in three cases related to the May 9 riots and allowed police his continued custody for interrogation.</p>

<p>In a detailed order issued here on Thursday, ATC Judge Khalid Arshad said: "An extraordinary concession of pre-arrest bail is meant for an innocent person and not the petitioner, Imran Khan Niazi, who hatched, materialised alleged criminal conspiracy along with the senior PTI leadership and protesters/accused having a common object to wage a war against the state to topple over the government." The order said that Mr Khan not only incited people but also instructed leaders to create chaos, disturb law and order, and commit arson to pressure the military and government for his release. This was disclosed in statements from two prosecution witnesses, The Express Tribune newspaper reported.</p>

<p>"The pre-arrest bail of the petitioner has no merits and is hereby dismissed while withdrawing his already granted interim bail," the judge said.</p>

<p>The judge further observed: A peaceful demonstrator becomes a "terrorist" when he hatches a criminal conspiracy, disseminates it and shares a common object with other accused, who, being armed, attack and attempt to damage state properties like Lahore Corps Commander House known as Jinnah House at Lahore, targeting government machinery ... He loses his normal right to be a law-abiding citizen."&nbsp;</p>

<p>The order, quoting the special public prosecutor, said that a criminal conspiracy was hatched at Mr Khan's Lahore Zaman Park residence on May 7 and 8 in which Mr Khan himself told the top PTI leadership regarding his apprehension of arrest and the reaction of launching protests and damage of military installations.</p>

<p>Reacting to the detailed ACT order, the PTI said, "The judgment contains no evidence of Imran Khan ordering May 9 violence. The judge while dismissing pre-arrest bails of Mr Khan is drawing inferences and assumptions." The PTI pointed out in its statement, how previously the Supreme Court of Pakistan had termed the arrest of Imran Khan, illegal and added: "We will challenge the verdict of the Anti-Terrorism Court." The anti-terrorist courts in other parts of the country, including Rawalpindi, Sargodha etc have dismissed the case accusing Imran Khan of being the main accused of instigating the May 9 violent incidents, based on the fact that there is no evidence provided establishing the prosecution's point," the PTI said.</p>

<p>The party also claimed that since Mr Khan is in prison only in the Iddat case, "which is evidently coming to a conclusion" on the likely dismissal of rubbish claims by the complainant, it seems this is yet another politically motivated case to prolong the illegal incarceration of Mr Khan."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the party's Parliamentary Committee decided that it would raise its voice for Mr Khan and all the innocent prisoners at protests or rallies, starting the movement immediately.</p>

<p>"Parliamentary Leader Ms Zartaj Gul Wazir @zartajgulwazir presided over the discussion regarding the decisions made in the meeting of the Parliamentary Committee," the PTI said in a post on its official X handle.</p>

<p>PTI core committee member Advocate Abuzar Salman Niazi said on X: "Absurd Order. Judge has declared Imran Khan is not innocent. Note: trial is still going on and no conviction is on record in this case. How can Imran Khan be declared guilty before completion of Trial. Where will principle of law (everyone is innocent until proven guilty). (sic)"&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>British police have launched a manhunt after two suitcases which are believed to contain human remains were found at the Clifton Suspension Bridge in Bristol, south west England.</p>

<p>Police said they had received a report of a man with a suitcase acting suspiciously on the bridge just before midnight on Wednesday but when they arrived he had already gone, leaving the suitcase behind. A second suitcase was also found nearby.</p>

<p>The suitcases are believed to contain human remains, Avon and Somerset Police said in a statement on Thursday.</p>

<p>"This is a very disturbing incident and I fully recognise the concern it will be causing our communities," Acting Bristol Commander Vicks Hayward-Melen said.</p>

<p>"Our immediate priority is to locate the man who took the suitcases to the bridge, identify the bodies, and inform their next of kin."</p>

<p>Police said they were speaking to the driver of a taxi which took the man to the bridge and had seized the vehicle. The bridge, spanning the Avon Gorge and the River Avon, is closed while crime scene investigators examine the area.</p>

<p>One of Bristol's most recognisable landmarks, the suspension bridge was built based on a design by renowned 19th century engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel and opened in 1864. It has protected status in law.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A dramatic&nbsp;video has captured the moment two&nbsp;planes from major commercial airlines appeared to nearly collide mid-air&nbsp;in Syracuse, New York.&nbsp;A dash camera from a North Syracuse Police Department patrol car captured the near in-air collision late morning on Monday, July 8.&nbsp;The close encounter stemmed from an apparent air traffic control error&nbsp;that cleared one plane to depart from Syracuse Hancock International Airport while the other was cleared to land on the same runway,&nbsp;<em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/video-jet-abort-landing-same-runway-departing-plane-near-collision-faa-investigating/">CBS News</a></em> reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Controllers initially cleared American Eagle Flight AA5511, a Bombardier CRJ-700 operated by PSA Airlines, to land on runway 28. Moments later, they gave Delta Connection DL5421, another CRJ-700 operated by Endeavor Air, permission to depart from the same runway.</p>

<p>The video shows both planes coming from different directions and appearing&nbsp;dangerously close to each other in the air near Syracuse Hancock Airport. According to the website&nbsp;<a href="https://www.flightradar24.com/36.59,-98.17/5" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" title="https://www.flightradar24.com/36.59,-98.17/5">FlightRadar24</a>, the planes came within 700-1,000 feet of each other vertically. While the Delta flight carried 76 passengers, the American Airlines flight had 75.&nbsp;Luckily, passengers on both planes were unharmed.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A planet relatively close to Earth could be the first ever detected with a potentially life-sustaining liquid ocean outside our Solar System, according to scientists using the James Webb space telescope.</p>

<p>More than 5,000 planets have been discovered outside of the Solar System so far, but only a handful are in what is called the "Goldilocks zone" -- neither too hot or too cold -- that could host liquid water, a key ingredient for life.</p>

<p>The exoplanet LHS 1140 b is one of the few in this habitable zone, and has been thoroughly scrutinised since it was first discovered in 2017.</p>

<p>It sits 48 light years from Earth, which equates to more than 450 trillion kilometres (280 trillion miles) -- relatively close in the vast distances of space.</p>

<p>The exoplanet had been thought to be a small gas giant called a "mini-Neptune" with an atmosphere too thick with hydrogen and helium to support alien life.</p>

<p>However, new observations from the Webb telescope have confirmed that the exoplanet is in fact a rocky "super-Earth".</p>

<p>It is 1.7 times bigger than Earth, but has 5.6 times its mass, according to a study published late Wednesday in The Astrophysical Journal Letters.</p>

<p><strong>'Best bet' for ocean world</strong></p>

<p>The Webb telescope was able to analyse the planet's atmosphere as it passed in front of its star.</p>

<p>There were no signs of hydrogen or helium, which ruled out that the planet was a mini-Neptune.</p>

<p>The density of the planet indicates that it "actually has large quantities of water," study co-author Martin Turbet of France's CNRS scientific research centre told AFP.</p>

<p>It could be a truly immense amount of water.</p>

<p>All the water in Earth's oceans represent only 0.02 percent of its mass. But 10 to 20 percent of the exoplanet's mass was estimated to be water.</p>

<p>Whether or not this water is in liquid or ice form depends on the planet's atmosphere.</p>

<p>"We do not have direct evidence that it has an atmosphere, but several elements point in that direction," Turbet said.</p>

<p>Lead study author Charles Cadieux, a PhD student at the University of Montreal, said that "of all currently known temperate exoplanets, LHS 1140 b could well be our best bet to one day indirectly confirm liquid water on the surface of an alien world".</p>

<p>One positive is that the planet is gently warmed by its red dwarf star, which is one-fifth the size of the Sun.</p>

<p>The exoplanet's surface temperature should be fairly similar to that on Earth and Mars, Turbet said.</p>

<p>The presence of gasses such as carbon dioxide will play a key role in determining whether the planet is covered in ice or water.</p>

<p><strong>Bull's-eye ocean</strong></p>

<p>One possibility is that the surface is mostly ice, but there is a vast liquid ocean where the planet is most exposed to its star's heat.</p>

<p>This ocean could measure about 4,000 kilometres in diameter, around half the surface area of the Atlantic Ocean, modelling suggested.</p>

<p>Or the liquid water could be hidden under a thick shell of ice, like on the moons Ganymede, Enceladus or Europa orbiting around Jupiter and Saturn.</p>

<p>Webb's instrument spotted signs that suggest "the presence of nitrogen," Cadieux said, adding that more research was needed to confirm the finding.</p>

<p>Nitrogen is found everywhere on Earth, and is thought to be another potentially ingredient for life.</p>

<p>The researchers are hoping to get a few more hours of the Webb's telescope's precious time to find out more about LHS 1140 b.</p>

<p>It will take at least a year to confirm whether the exoplanet has an atmosphere, and two or three more to detect the presence of carbon dioxide, the researchers estimated.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Germany said Thursday it will phase out the use of components from Chinese telecom giants Huawei and ZTE in its 5G networks in the coming years due to national security concerns.</p>

<p>Parts from the firms will no longer be used in "core" 5G mobile networks by the end of 2026 at the latest, the interior ministry said.</p>

<p>In 5G access and transmission infrastructure, the systems of the telecom firms must be replaced by the end of 2029.</p>

<p>"We are protecting the central nervous systems of Germany as a business location -- and we are protecting the communication of citizens, companies, and the state," said Interior Minister Nancy Faeser.</p>

<p>"We must reduce security risks and, unlike in the past, avoid one-sided dependencies."</p>

<p>The ministry said that 5G networks form part of Germany's "critical infrastructure" and are important for the functioning of sectors ranging from health to transport and energy.</p>

<p>China and Germany, the world's number two and number three economies respectively, have long had close economic ties.</p>

<p>But Berlin has been seeking to reduce its economic dependency on China, particularly since the war in Ukraine and subsequent energy crisis exposed an over-reliance on Russia.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>India's stance on the Russia-Ukraine war is well-established: it advocates for a cessation of hostilities and prefers dialogue over conflict, a position consistently articulated in international forums. However, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Moscow, his camaraderie with Russian President Vladimir Putin, and the pledge to enhance bilateral trade and defence cooperation signify a strategic shift in stance.</p>

<p>The visit aims to send a strong message to India's Western allies that while navigating complex global issues, India remains committed to safeguarding its national interests. After all, India's Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs) saved over $10 billion from April 2022 to May 2024, largely due to Russian crude imports, as per an analysis by the Indian Express. Additionally, it underscores India's enduring friendship with Russia amidst geopolitical dynamics, including a pointed message to China.</p>

<p>PM Modi has demonstrated adeptness in making bold foreign policy moves, exemplified by strong ties fostered with Gulf countries during his tenure. While India values its friendships with the US and other Western nations, it is steering its own course to protect its national interests. This is a trajectory which is set to accelerate in Modi's third term. The agreement to establish Indo-Russian joint ventures for defence production and facilitating military exports to mutually agreed friendly nations exemplifies this forward-looking approach.</p>

<p>Following his Russian trip, Modi's subsequent visit to Austria marks India's Prime Minister's first official trip since 1983, illustrating a pattern of seeking new allies. This trend has been evident since Modi took office a decade ago.</p>

<p>Modi's third term is distinct in its recent foreign policy decisions. From inviting all neighbouring countries except China and Pakistan to his swearing-in ceremony, to strategic engagements at the G-7 summit in Italy, and now visits to Russia and Austria, Modi is making significant statements on the global stage. Foreign policy remains a cornerstone of Modi 3.0's agenda.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The fire that broke out Thursday in the spire of the cathedral in the northern French city Rouen has been extinguished, local fire services said, with no major damage reported.</p>

<p>A section of plastic sheeting covering renovation work 120 metres (400 feet) up the cathedral's spire caught fire, though officials have not said how the blaze started.</p>

<p>Workers at the site first attempted to put out the fire and then alerted the departmental fire service, who raised the alarm around midday (1000 GMT). Some 40 vehicles and 70 firefighters responded to the scene.</p>

<p>The city's mayor shared a photo of a column of smoke rising from the Gothic landmark.</p>

<p>The fire was quickly brought "under control", said local fire chief Stephane Gouezec, and was declared extinguished at about 5 pm local time.</p>

<p>"The interior was saved, above all the works of art," said Culture Minister Rachida Dati, who visited the scene at the request of President Emmanuel Macron.</p>

<p>Some 28 pieces were removed preventatively, the local prefecture said.</p>

<p>Three workers on site suffered from mild smoke inhalation when they tried to put out the fire with extinguishers, according to local authorities.</p>

<p>"Fire broke out at the tip of the spire, which isn't made of wood, but rather metal," the prefecture of the Seine-Maritime department told AFP.</p>

<p>A fire in the wooden frame of the roof was behind the massive 2019 damage to the world-famous Notre Dame cathedral in Paris, where repairs are only now nearing completion.</p>

<p>Construction began on Rouen's cathedral in the 12th Century, according to its website, with work lasting several centuries.</p>

<p>Renovations have been ongoing since 2017, according to Normandy's culture authority.</p>

<p>Lightning struck the cathedral's spire in 1822, destroying the wooden structure which was rebuilt using cast iron then steel in the early 19th-century.</p>

<p>Some of the renovation work involved creating firewalls within the wooden structure to prevent it suffering the same fate as Notre Dame, as well as reinforcing the roofing vaults.</p>

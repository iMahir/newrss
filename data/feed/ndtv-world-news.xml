       <description><![CDATA[A BBC documentary in September revealed Al Fayed sexually abused female staff at his London department store Harrods.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>More than 400 alleged victims have so far contacted the legal team working on a case against the late Egyptian billionaire Mohamed Al Fayed, who has been accused of sexual abuse and rape, lawyer Dean Armstrong said on Thursday.</p>

<p>A BBC documentary in September revealed Al Fayed, who died last year aged 94, sexually abused female staff at his London department store Harrods, forced them to have medical screenings and threatened consequences if they tried to complain.</p>

<p>"The sheer scale of abuse perpetrated by Al Fayed, and facilitated by those around him, sadly, continues to grow," Armstrong told a news conference in London.</p>

<p>Al Fayed always denied similar accusations raised by other reports before his death.</p>

<p>When asked for a response, Harrods pointed Reuters to its past statements on the allegations, in which it has apologised, said it was "appalled" by them and that it had launched a process for any current or former Harrods employees who wish to claim compensation.</p>

<p>Another lawyer, Bruce Drummond, said the more than 400 claims have been made by women from around the world, mostly from Britain but also from the United States, Australia, Malaysia, Spain, South Africa and other countries.</p>

<p>"That, in our opinion, is an industrial scale abuse," Drummond said, adding abuse took place "within the walls of Harrods" but also in other locations linked to Al Fayed's business empire, such as Fulham Football Club, the Ritz Paris and his estate in Surrey.</p>

<p>Victims include the daughter of a former U.S. ambassador to Britain and the daughter of a well-known soccer player, Drummond said, without giving any names.</p>

<p>The BBC documentary said Harrods had failed to intervene and helped to cover up abuse allegations during his ownership.</p>

<p>Lawyers have criticised the Harrods-run compensation scheme, saying some of the victims do not feel comfortable to reach out to Harrods directly for compensation as that is where the abuse unfolded.</p>

<p>Drummond said some senior members of staff from the Al Fayed era still worked at Harrods.</p>

<p>The Financial Times last week reported that four alleged victims had quit the Harrods compensation scheme due to their concerns over potential conflicts of interest and poor communication.</p>

<p>Several media organisations had reported allegations of sexual abuse against Al Fayed before the BBC documentary, including Vanity Fair in 1995, ITV in 1997 and Channel 4 in 2017. Lawyers said in September many of the women only felt able to speak publicly in the BBC report after he died last year.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The unprecedented penalty targets YouTube, owned by Google's parent company Alphabet, over the platform's decision to block Russian state-run media channels in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russia issued a fine against Google, estimated at an astronomical $20 decillion - a 2 followed by 34 zeroes. The unprecedented penalty targets YouTube, owned by Google's parent company Alphabet, over the platform's decision to block Russian state-run media channels in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. This sum far exceeds any reasonable financial scale, surpassing the entire global economy many times over.</p>

<p>The penalty arose after a Russian court ruled that Google violated national broadcasting rules by barring channels from Russian state-backed media outlets on YouTube. The fine is compounded by an additional ruling that demands the restoration of these channels, with the fines doubling each day if the platform fails to comply within a nine-month period.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The issue traces back to March 2022, when YouTube announced a global ban on several Russian state-operated channels, including RT and Sputnik. The platform justified its decision by pointing to content policies prohibiting material that denies, minimises, or trivialises violent events. YouTube has enforced such policies against channels supporting Russia's narratives around the Ukraine conflict, removing over 1,000 channels and more than 15,000 videos globally. In Europe, restrictions on Russian state media accounts were imposed before the ban expanded worldwide. This action led to backlash from Russia, which views the move as censorship and suppression of its state-sponsored media.</p>

<p>Since 2020, Google has faced ongoing penalties, starting with a daily fine of 100,000 rubles (approximately $1,028) over blocked Russian channels from Tsargrad and RIA FAN, two prominent Russian state-affiliated media outlets.</p>

<p>According to reports, 17 Russian broadcasters have joined the legal fray, filing suits against Google and demanding the reinstatement of their channels on the platform.</p>

<p>Following the onset of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in early 2022, Google significantly curtailed its operations within Russia but stopped short of a complete exit. Services like YouTube and Google Search remain accessible within Russian borders. Unlike some American tech companies that fully withdrew, Google's partial operations in Russia continue, although its Russia subsidiary filed for bankruptcy several months into the conflict after the Russian government seized its bank accounts.</p>

<p>The Kremlin has called the fine a largely symbolic measure intended to compel Google to reconsider its stance on Russian broadcasters. Dmitry Peskov, spokesperson for the Kremlin, told Russian media that the monumental fine amount is intended to attract attention to the seriousness with which Russia views the issue of YouTube's bans on Russian media. "I can't even pronounce this figure right," Peskov said.</p>

<p>Since its invasion of Ukraine, Russia has leveraged a range of penalties against foreign tech platforms for hosting content deemed anti-Russian or pro-Ukrainian. Although YouTube remains accessible within Russia, authorities have threatened to block the platform outright if it continues to restrict Russian media channels.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[The rescue teams are still searching for those missing in what could become Europe's worst storm-related disaster in over five decades.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The death count from devastating flash floods in eastern Spain climbed to 158 on Thursday, with rescue teams still searching for those missing in what could become Europe's worst storm-related disaster in over five decades.</p>

<p>"There's a total of 158 people to which must be added dozens and dozens of missing," Angel Victor Torres, minister in charge of cooperation with Spain's regions, told a press conference.</p>

<p>A year's worth of rain fell in eight hours in parts of the Valencia region on Tuesday.</p>

<p>The tragedy is already Spain's worst flood-related disaster in modern history, and meteorologists say human-driven climate change is making such extreme weather events more frequent and destructive.</p>

<p>In 2021, at least 185 people died in heavy flooding in Germany. Prior to that, 209 people died in Romania in 1970 and floods in Portugal in 1967 killed nearly 500 people.</p>

<p>Rescue teams on Thursday discovered the bodies of eight people, including a local policeman, who had been trapped in a garage on the outskirts of the city of Valencia, Mayor Maria Jose Catala told reporters.</p>

<p>In the same neighbourhood of La Torre, she said, a 45-year-old woman was also found dead in her home.</p>

<p>Thousands of people carrying bags or pushing shopping trolleys could be seen on Thursday crossing a pedestrian bridge over the Turia River from La Torre into Valencia city centre to stock up on essential supplies such as toilet paper and water.</p>

<p>Opposition politicians accused the central government in Madrid of acting too slowly to warn residents and send in rescue teams, prompting the Interior Ministry to say regional authorities were responsible for civil protection measures.</p>

<p>"Those people wouldn't have died if they had been warned in time," Laura Villaescusa, a neighbour and manager of a local supermarket, told Reuters.</p>

<p>Maribel Albalat, mayor of the nearby town of Paiporta, said residents were not warned of the imminent danger of flooding. She said 62 people had died in her town.</p>

<p>"We found a lot of elderly people inside their homes and people who went to get their cars. It was a trap," she told TVE.</p>

<h3><strong>CLINGING TO PILLAR</strong></h3>

<p>In Godelleta, a town 37 km (23 miles) west of Valencia city, Antonio Molina, 52, described how he survived by clinging to a pillar on a neighbour's porch on Tuesday as water reached his neck.</p>

<p>Molina's home suffered two major floods in 2018 and 2020 and he blamed authorities for allowing construction of residential buildings in depressions where water accumulates.</p>

<p>"We don't want to live here anymore," he said, tearfully. "As soon as we get a couple of raindrops, we're already checking our phones."</p>

<p>The floods have battered Valencia's infrastructure, sweeping away bridges, roads and rail tracks, and submerged farmland in a region that produces about two-thirds of Spain's citrus crops like oranges, which the country exports globally.</p>

<p>About 80 km (50 miles) of roads in the eastern region were seriously damaged or impassable, said Transport Minister Oscar Puente. Many were blocked by abandoned cars.</p>

<p>"Unfortunately there are dead bodies in some vehicles," Puente told reporters, adding that it would take two to three weeks to re-establish the high-speed train connection between Valencia and Madrid.</p>

<p>Visiting a rescue coordination centre near Valencia city, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez urged people to stay at home due to the threat of more stormy weather.</p>

<p>"Right now the most important thing is to safeguard as many lives as possible," he told reporters.</p>

<p>In the hard-hit rural town of Utiel, some 85 km (53 miles) inland, the Magro River burst its banks, sending up to three metres (9.8 feet) of water into the mostly single-storey homes.</p>

<p>Utiel's mayor, Ricardo Gabaldon, said at least six people died in the town of about 12,000, most of them elderly or disabled people who were unable to clamber to safety.</p>

<p>Residents used water pumps carried on tractors as they started to clean up on Thursday, with children helping to sweep the sidewalks. Ruined household appliances and furniture were piled up in the middle of roads and elderly people struggled to walk in the slippery, mud-coated streets.</p>

<p>Pope Francis said he was praying for the people of the region. "I'm close to them in this moment of catastrophe," he said in a video posted on X.</p>

<p>Research group Climate Central said in a report on Thursday that a low-pressure system behind Spain's floods had tapped into an "atmospheric river" carrying excess moisture from the unusually warm Tropical Atlantic.</p>

<p>According to its Climate Shift Index: Ocean, human-caused climate change has made these elevated sea surface temperatures at least 50 to 300 times more likely.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A US woman and her two children died after jumping off Niagara Falls on Monday night, the <em>Independent</em> reported. The woman, identified as 33-year-old Chianti Means climbed over a safety rail and intentionally went over the waterfall with her two children, a nine-year-old and a 5-month-old. Authorities reached the scene around 9 pm on Monday and determined that the family went over the rail on Luna Island, a popular sight-seeing point above the waterfall with a nearly 200-foot drop. Investigators also determined that the plunge was "intentional". "The circumstances remain under investigation," state troopers said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Investigation determined that three individuals, Chianti Means, 33 years old, Roman Rossman, 9 years old and Mecca Means, 5 months old all of Niagara Falls, NY crossed over safety guild rail and went over Niagara Falls on Luna Island (attached to Goat Island)," state police said in a news release, per the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/niagara-falls-death-chianti-means-b2638845.html" rel="noindex, nofollow">outlet</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The investigation has determined that this incident was intentional in nature, though the circumstances remain under investigation. New York State Park Police and State Police search/rescue efforts were conducted with negative results. This incident deems no public threat to safety," the department added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ms Chianti, a mother of two, was a resident of Niagara Falls, where she lived with her children. As of Wednesday, there is no news about the discovery of their bodies, the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/10/30/us-news/new-york-mom-and-two-young-kids-including-5-month-old-baby-dead-after-jumping-off-niagara-falls/" rel="noindex, nofollow"><em>New York Post </em></a>reported.</p>

<p>The 33-year-old worked as a domestic violence counsellor, according to her LinkedIn profile, and graduated from school in nearby Buffalo. Shortly after the news of her death broke, tributes from friends and family started pouring in. "I have been speechless and crying and couldn't sleep at all," wrote friend Kayshawna Morgane on Facebook, adding, "My heart is broken. Mental health is no joke."</p>

<p>"I can't even bear to write a post about her and share memories.I am literally sick to my stomach and I can't even deal with the emotions I am feeling. Just know her and her children are dearly loved by me and my children," said friend Mich Molina. "You really never know what anybody is going through," said another, Niesha Eukeya.</p>

<p>An investigation is ongoing. Authorities are reportedly using unmanned aircraft and underwater units in the investigation.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former US President Donald Trump, in a Diwali message on Thursday, condemned the atrocities faced by Hindus in Bangladesh, especially after the fall of the Sheikh Hasina government. He also vowed to protect the Hindu Americans against "anti-religion agendas" and fight for their freedom.</p>

<p>"I strongly condemn the barbaric violence against Hindus, Christians, and other minorities who are getting attacked and looted by mobs in Bangladesh, which remains in a total state of chaos. It would have never happened on my watch," Mr Trump wrote in a post on X.</p>

<p>This is the first time Mr Trump has spoken on the issue of Bangladesh.</p>

<p>The US Presidential candidate hit out at his Democratic rival Kamala Harris, saying that she and US President Joe Biden have "ignored" Hindus across the world as well as in America.</p>

<p>"Kamala and Joe have ignored Hindus across the world and in America. They have been a disaster from Israel to Ukraine to our own Southern Border, but we will Make America Strong Again and bring back Peace through Strength!," he said.</p>

<p>Mr Trump, who extended his Diwali wishes to Indians, also vowed to strengthen his country's partnership with India and his "good friend" <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/140-crore-indians-worried-about-safety-of-hindus-in-bangladesh-pm-modi-6341273">Prime Minister Narendra Modi</a>.</p>

<p>"Under my administration, we will also strengthen our great partnership with India and my good friend, Prime Minister Modi. Also, Happy Diwali to All. I hope the Festival of Lights leads to the Victory of Good over Evil," he wrote.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>On August 5, former Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina fled the country, ending her 15-year rule as student protests against her government escalated. Following this, the minority Hindus in the country have been facing violence, and vandalism of temples and their businesses. According to the Bangladesh National Hindu Grand Alliance, attacks and threats against the minority community have taken place in over 200 locations across 48 districts. Hundreds of Hindus were also killed between July and August this year.</p>

<p>The minority Hindus constitute about eight percent of the population in Bangladesh.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United States has an electoral system and calendar unlike no other country. The nation votes in November but the new President is inaugurated in January. While many countries swiftly usher in new leaders, the US takes a more measured approach with an 11-week transition period. Although this duration may seem lengthy, it is, in fact, shorter than the four months that the Constitution originally permitted for the transfer of power from an incumbent president to their successor.</p>

<p><strong>Historical context</strong></p>

<p>Federal elections in the US are held on the first Tuesday in November. Initially, states had different election days, but in 1845, a law established a uniform election day nationwide. At the time, the US was predominantly agricultural, and early November proved advantageous for farmers. The harvest would be complete, yet the weather remained good for travel. Certain days were ruled out for voting. Sunday was universally recognised as a day of worship for devout Christians, while Wednesday served as a market day for farmers to sell their produce. In addition, reaching polling places often required travel, even up to a day for those living in rural areas without modern transport. With Sunday and Wednesday unavailable, Monday and Thursday were also eliminated as potential election days. As such, Tuesday emerged as the most suitable choice.<br />
<br />
<strong>From four months to under three months</strong><br />
<br />
The challenges faced during the Great Depression prompted leaders to expedite the swearing-in process for newly elected presidents, reducing the lengthy four-month “lame duck” period to under three months. A “lame duck” refers to an elected official whose successor has already been chosen, leaving them politically weakened.<br />
<br />
The 20th Amendment, ratified in 1933, officially moved the inauguration date to January 20, while presidential elections continue to occur in early November.<br />
<br />
<strong>Logistical considerations</strong><br />
<br />
One of the main reasons for this gap is the need for a seamless transition of power. After the election, the president-elect and their team require time to prepare for governance. This includes assembling a cabinet, developing policies and addressing national issues. The time between the election and inauguration allows the incoming administration to lay the groundwork for their agenda.<br />
<br />
The extended transition period can also be attributed to the Electoral College system, which determines the president weeks after the popular vote, as opposed to a parliamentary system where the winning party directly assumes power. While this delay means that presidents cannot take office immediately, the winner is granted access to transition funding and can receive essential briefings from the outgoing administration to facilitate a smooth handover.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the US presidential election nears, the two primary candidates &nbsp;-- Republican nominee Donald Trump and his Democratic counterpart Kamala Harris -- are making their last pitch to the voters at multiple rallies in a day. But there's another thing keeping the US electorate and political observers on their toes. What will unfold if Harris wins? The reason? Well, former President Donald Trump has routinely claimed that a loss for him will only be due to Democratic interference. This has raised concerns that he may again cast doubt on the results, as he did in 2020 when he sought to challenge Joe Biden's win.</p>

<p>During a Michigan rally in September, Trump said, “If I lose, I'll tell you what, it's possible. Because they cheat. That's the only way we're gonna lose because they cheat.”</p>

<p><strong>New safeguards for this election</strong></p>

<p>New safeguards introduced for this election aim to reduce the chances of any efforts to undermine the outcome from gaining traction.</p>

<p><strong>The new protections include:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>An electoral law enacted by Congress following the January 6 insurrection.</li>
	<li>Recent court rulings reinforcing electoral integrity.</li>
	<li>Increased vigilance from state election officials.</li>
	<li>More aggressive action by law enforcement agencies.</li>
</ul>

<p>These measures have been put in place to prevent any recurrence of the violent Capitol scenes from four years ago.</p>

<p><strong>What happened in 2020?</strong></p>

<p>After his 2020 loss, Trump and his allies sought to challenge the election outcome through numerous lawsuits, all of which failed to alter or delay the results. He also pressured Georgia officials to "find" additional votes in his favour, and his supporters stormed the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, in an unsuccessful attempt to prevent Vice President Mike Pence from certifying Biden's victory. This election, however, Trump no longer has access to the presidential powers he wielded in 2020 -- a significant change in circumstances.</p>

<p><strong>Trump, allies may question Harris win</strong></p>

<p>Trump and his allies have been actively preparing to challenge the election outcome if he loses on November 5. In the event of a Harris win, he may pursue legal avenues or cast doubt on the legitimacy of her victory among his supporters, potentially leading to unforeseen reactions, reported Reuters.</p>

<p>Both Republicans and Democrats anticipate that counting could extend for several days post-election as mail-in and other ballots are processed and verified. If Trump appears to be trailing, the delay could prompt him to allege fraud and work to erode public confidence in election officials, potentially inciting protests.</p>

<p>He has also suggested punitive action against election workers and officials for “unscrupulous” behaviour, though he needs to secure a victory first to act on such threats.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With just a few days to go for the United States elections, a staggering 61.0 million Americans have already made their voices heard by casting their ballots in the November election, according to a report by CNN.</p>

<p>Notably, voters have cast their ballots either by mail or through early in-person voting for the presidential elections between Vice President Kamala Harris, a Democrat and former President Donald Trump, a Republican.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, according to new CNN polls conducted by SSRS, the presidential race is heating up in Georgia and North Carolina, with the latest polls showing a neck-and-neck contest between Harris and Trump.</p>

<p>Likely voters in Georgia divide 48 per cent for Trump to 47 per cent for Harris, and in North Carolina, Harris stands at 48 per cent to Trump's 47 per cent, CNN reported.</p>

<p>These narrow margins are within the poll's margin of error, indicating no clear frontrunner in either state.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that North Carolina, which supported former President Barack Obama in 2008, has voted Republican in the past three presidential elections. However, in 2020, Trump won against US President Joe Biden.</p>

<p>Joe Biden made history in Georgia four years ago by defeating Donald Trump with a margin of less than 1 percentage point, becoming the first Democrat to win the state since Bill Clinton's victory in 1992.</p>

<p>In both states, Georgia and North Carolina, Harris is leading among the Black likely voters (84 per cent to 13 per cent in Georgia; 78 per cent to 19 per cent in North Carolina) and voters with college degrees (55 per cent to 39 per cent in Georgia; 53 per cent to 42 per cent in North Carolina).</p>

<p>On the other hand, white college graduates divide around evenly in both states (50 per cent Harris to 47 per cent Trump in North Carolina, 48 per cent Trump to 46 per cent Harris in Georgia). Trump holds a commanding lead, 81 per cent to 15 per cent, among White voters without college degrees in Georgia. He leads that group by a less overwhelming margin, 65 per cent to 31 per cent, in North Carolina, CNN reported.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former US President and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has said that the United States' "great partnership" with India and "my good friend Prime Minister (Narendra) Modi" will be strengthened under his administration.</p>

<p>In a post on X, Trump also extended his greetings on Diwali. "... Happy Diwali to All. I hope the Festival of Lights leads to the Victory of Good over Evil!," he posted.</p>

<p>In the same post, the former President condemned the violence against Hindus and other minorities in Bangladesh.</p>

<p>"I strongly condemn the barbaric violence against Hindus, Christians, and other minorities who are getting attacked and looted by mobs in Bangladesh, which remains in a total state of chaos," he said, adding that it would have "never happened" on his watch.</p>

<p>Trump accused Vice President Kamala Harris and President Joe Biden of ignoring Hindus across the world and in America.</p>

<p>He also vowed to make "America Strong Again and bring back Peace through Strength".</p>

<p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I strongly condemn the barbaric violence against Hindus, Christians, and other minorities who are getting attacked and looted by mobs in Bangladesh, which remains in a total state of chaos.<br><br>It would have never happened on my watch.

<p>"We will also protect Hindu Americans against the anti-religion agenda of the radical left. We will fight for your freedom. Under my administration, we will also strengthen our great partnership with India and my good friend, Prime Minister Modi," he said.</p>

<p>The former President further said that Harris will "destroy your small businesses with more regulations and higher taxes".</p>

<p>"By contrast, I cut taxes, cut regulations, unleashed American energy, and built the greatest economy in history. We will do it again, bigger and better than ever before -- and we will Make America Great Again," he added.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken on Thursday revealed that approximately 10,000 North Korean soldiers are currently in Russia, with around 8,000 deployed in the Kursk region.</p>

<p>He further said that while these troops have not yet been engaged in combat against Ukrainian forces, he anticipates their involvement in the coming days.</p>

<p>The remarks by Blinken came during a press conference with US Secretary of Defence Lloyd J. Austin III, Republic of Korea Minister of Foreign Affairs Cho Tae-yul, and Republic of Korea Minister of Defence Kim Yong-hyun on Thursday.</p>

<p>Blinken said, "We now assess that there are some 10,000 North Korean soldiers in total in Russia. And recent information indicates that as many as 8,000 of those North Korean forces have been deployed in the Kursk region. We have not yet seen these troops deployed in the combat against Ukrainian forces but we expect that to happen in the coming days."</p>

<p>He added, "Russia has been training Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) soldiers in artillery, UAVs, and basic infantry operations, indicating that they fully intend to use these forces in front-line operations. Should these troops engage in combat or combat-support operations against Ukraine, they would become legitimate military."</p>

<p>The US Secretary of State sharply criticised Russia, stating that President Vladimir Putin is "throwing Russians in a meat grinder" and is now turning towards North Korea which is a "clear sign of weakness." He said, "One of the reasons that Russia is turning towards North Korean troops is that it is desperate. Putin has been throwing more and more Russians into a meat grinder of his own making in Ukraine and now he's turning to North Korean troops and that is a clear sign of weakness."</p>

<p>Blinken added, "Russia is suffering some 12,000 casualties a day and with the deployment of North Korean troops, this is the first time in 100 years that Russia has invited foreign troops into its country."</p>

<p>Notably, NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte on October 28 confirmed the deployment of North Korean troops to Russia, following reports from Ukrainian military intelligence that noted their presence in the Kursk border region, Al Jazeera had reported.</p>

<p>Blinken also condemned North Korea's latest intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) launch and said, "One of the things that we emphasise today is reaffirmation of the United States' ironclad commitment to security... That's important in light of ongoing provocations coming from North Korea, including another ICBM launch just yesterday. We condemn it in the strongest words..."</p>

<p>Notably, Japan's Defence Ministry reported that North Korea launched at least one ballistic missile on Thursday morning, suspected to be an ICBM-class weapon.</p>

<p>The missile, launched at 7:11 am local time, flew eastward from within North Korea's interior before landing outside Japan's Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) in waters approximately 200 kilometres west of Hokkaido's Okushiri Island at 8:37 am, NHK World reported.</p>

<p>Japan's Defence Minister Nakatani Gen stated that the missile's flight duration of one hour and 26 minutes marks the longest-ever trajectory of a North Korean ballistic missile. He further noted that the missile travelled around 1,000 kilometres and reached a peak altitude of approximately 7,000 kilometres.</p>

<p>This launch marks North Korea's 12th ballistic missile or suspected ballistic missile launch this year, and the first ICBM-class missile launch since December 2023.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Google on Thursday defeated a trademark lawsuit brought by a British short film company over YouTube's short video platform Shorts, with London's High Court ruling there was no risk of confusion for consumers.</p>

<p>Shorts International, which runs a television channel devoted to short films, sued the tech giant last year, accusing Google of infringing its trademark over the word "shorts".</p>

<p>Google-owned YouTube had launched Shorts, featuring minute-long videos, in late 2020 as it struggled to compete with TikTok.</p>

<p>Google's lawyer Lindsay Lane argued in court documents at a trial earlier this month that it was "abundantly clear" that the Shorts platform came from YouTube, not Shorts International.</p>

<p>Judge Michael Tappin said in a written ruling that none of Google's uses of the word "shorts" would lead to any likelihood of confusion as to the origin of the platform.</p>

<p>He also said that Google and YouTube's use of the word "will not cause damage to the distinctive character or repute of (Shorts International's) trade marks" and dismissed the lawsuit.</p>

<p>Google and Shorts International did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If a monkey types randomly at a keyboard for long enough, it will eventually write the complete works of Shakespeare.</p>

<p>This thought experiment has long been used to express how an infinite amount of time makes something that is incredibly unlikely -- but still technically possible -- become probable.</p>

<p>But two Australian mathematicians have deemed the old adage misleading, working out that even if all the chimpanzees in the world were given the entire lifespan of the universe, they would "almost certainly" never pen the works of the bard.</p>

<p>The "infinite monkey theorem" has been around for more than a century, though its origin remains unclear. It is commonly attributed to either French mathematician Emile Borel or British anthropologist Thomas Huxley, and some even think the general idea dates back to Aristotle.</p>

<p>For a light-hearted but peer-reviewed study published earlier this week, the two mathematicians set out to determine what happens if generous yet finite limits were placed on the monkey typists.</p>

<p>Their calculations were based on a monkey spending around 30 years typing one key a second at a keyboard with 30 keys -- the letters of the English language plus some common punctuation.</p>

<p>The "heat death" of the universe was assumed to take place in around a googol of years -- that is a one followed by 100 zeroes.</p>

<p>Other more practical considerations -- such as what the monkeys would eat, or how they would survive the Sun engulfing Earth in a few billion years -- were set aside.</p>

<p><strong>Monkey labour falls short</strong></p>

<p>There was only around a five percent chance that a single monkey would randomly write the word "banana" in their lifetime, according to the study in the journal Franklin Open.</p>

<p>Shakespeare's canon includes 884,647 words -- none of them banana.</p>

<p>To broaden out the experiment, the mathematicians turned to chimpanzees, the closest relative of humans.</p>

<p>There are currently around 200,000 chimps on Earth, and the study presumed this population would remain stable until the end of time.</p>

<p>Even this massive monkey workforce fell very, very short.</p>

<p>"It's not even like one in a million," study co-author Stephen Woodcock of the University of Technology Sydney told New Scientist.</p>

<p>"If every atom in the universe was a universe in itself, it still wouldn't happen."</p>

<p>And even if many more chimps who typed much quicker were added to the equation, it was still not plausible "that monkey labour will ever be a viable tool for developing written works of anything beyond the trivial," the authors wrote in the study.</p>

<p>The study concluded by saying that Shakespeare himself may have inadvertently given an answer as to whether "monkey labour could meaningfully be a replacement for human endeavour as a source of scholarship or creativity".</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>American voters seeking a progressive, environmentally focused candidate with a proven history of challenging the political mainstream have a&nbsp;choice in 2024. Jill Stein, the Green Party's nominee and a two-time presidential candidate, is having another run. Known for her advocacy for climate justice, healthcare for all and social equity, Stein is positioning herself as an alternative in a race dominated by major party figures. As a secular Jew who grew up in Reform Judaism and deeply values social justice, Stein has previously made headlines for her bold stance on US foreign policy, including opposition to aid for Israel and support for the Boycott, Divestment&nbsp;and Sanctions (BDS) movement. Her left-leaning platform, which champions a “Green New Deal” and a significant reduction in military spending, aims to energise voters disillusioned by the familiar faces of Kamala Harris and Donald Trump and&nbsp; disrupt the well-trodden path of the US two-party system.<br />
<br />
<strong>Who Is Jill Stein?</strong><br />
<br />
Jill Stein is a former physician and environmental advocate, bringing a wealth of experience to the ballot. She advocates for bold policies centred on the Green New Deal and social justice with her call for “people, planet, and peace.” While her polling numbers currently hover between 1.1 per cent and 1.4 per cent nationally, her message resonates deeply with a tiny minority yearning for real change.<br />
<br />
<strong>Early Life And Education</strong><br />
<br />
Born on May 14, 1950, in Chicago, Jill Stein is of Russian-Jewish ancestry. She attended North Shore Congregation Israel and was influenced deeply by the values instilled in her. In a 2012 interview, she noted the significant impact of Reform Judaism's emphasis on social justice, saying her parents - especially her Holocaust-survivor mother - instilled in her &nbsp;the importance of social responsibility.<br />
She graduated from Harvard University with a degree in sociology in 1973 and earned her medical degree from Harvard Medical School in 1979.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<strong>From Doctor To Activist</strong><br />
<br />
Jill Stein began her career as an instructor in internal medicine at Harvard Medical School. She practiced medicine for 25 years. In the 1990s, as a physician, she saw how toxic exposures linked to environmental issues harmed our health. This realisation drove her to fight for a cleaner environment, helping non-profits and marginalised communities address environmental injustice and racism. She played a key role in cleaning up the "Filthy Five" coal plants in Massachusetts, raising national standards for pollution.<br />
<br />
Stein also worked to close a toxic medical waste incinerator in Lawrence, Massachusetts, a low-income area in New England. She helped improve fish advisories&nbsp;to better protect women, children, Native Americans and immigrants from mercury contamination.<br />
<br />
Witnessing how lobbyists and campaign contributions blocked health and environmental protections, Stein focused on campaign finance reform. She helped pass the Clean Election Law through a voter referendum, which succeeded with a two-to-one margin. However, the Democratic-controlled Massachusetts Legislature repealed it later. This event strengthened Stein's alignment with the Green Party and her commitment to reducing corporate influence in politics.<br />
<br />
In 2003, Jill Stein co-founded the Massachusetts Coalition for Healthy Communities. Five years later, she led the “Secure Green Future” ballot initiative. This measure aimed to shift subsidies from fossil fuels to renewable energy and create green jobs. It received overwhelming support, winning over 81 per cent of the vote in the districts where it appeared on the ballot.<br />
<br />
<strong>Political Career</strong><br />
<br />
Jill Stein joined the Green Party in 2002, driven by her growing dissatisfaction with the Democratic Party's stance on environmental and social issues. The final straw was the repeal of Massachusetts' Clean Election Law, which provided public funding for candidates not receiving large private donations.<br />
<br />
Stein's transition to the Green Party began in 2000 when she participated in the Massachusetts Democratic Party's platform committee. She advocated for environmental and social justice measures but felt her efforts were ignored. In 2002, Stein ran for governor of Massachusetts as a Green-Rainbow Party candidate. She later became a member of the Lexington Town Meeting in 2005.<br />
<br />
<strong>2012 Presidential Election Campaign</strong><br />
<br />
Jill Stein ran for president in 2012 as the Green Party nominee. Her campaign focused on the Green New Deal, Medicare for All, free higher education, ending wars and occupations and climate action.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Throughout her campaign, Stein faced challenges, including being excluded from major presidential debates due to Commission on Presidential Debates rules requiring candidates to poll at 15 per cent nationally. Undeterred, Stein participated in alternative debates and engaged with voters through social media and grassroots events. She and running mate Cheri Honkala were arrested while attempting to enter the Hofstra University debate site.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
On Election Day, Stein received just 0.4 per cent of the total votes. Stein's 2012 run laid the groundwork for her subsequent presidential campaigns in 2016 and 2024.<br />
<br />
<strong>2016 Presidential Election Campaign</strong><br />
<br />
In her 2016 presidential campaign, Jill Stein focused on the “Power to the People Plan,” focusing on the Green New Deal, jobs as a right, and healthcare and education as fundamental rights. Her campaign gained traction, especially among Bernie Sanders' supporters at the Democratic National Convention. Stein selected human rights activist Ajamu Baraka as her running mate, and her campaign raised over $11 million, qualifying for federal matching funds.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
On Election Day, she received over 1.07 per cent of the popular vote, performing well in Hawaii, Oregon and Vermont.<br />
<br />
<strong>Jill Stein's Stance On Israel</strong><br />
<br />
Jill Stein previously called for ending all foreign aid to Israel, accusing it of committing war crimes. Her campaign supported the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions (BDS) movement, claiming Israel engages in policies similar to apartheid and illegal settlements. She has also publicly criticised US support for Israel, arguing that it enables the Israeli government's worst behaviours.<br />
<br />
In 2016, she <a href="https://x.com/DrJillStein/status/752875581780402176 ">tweeted</a> against her opponents “Pro Israeli” Democrat Bernie Sanders and Republican Donald Trump, saying, “If you don't want to vote for a warmonger or racist billionaire, there are more options. The political revolution will keep going.”<br />
<br />
<strong>Awards And Recognition</strong><br />
<br />
Jill Stein has earned several awards for her work in health and environmental protection, including Clean Water Action's ‘Not in Anyone's Backyard' Award and the ‘Children's Health Hero' Award.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
She has been featured as an environmental health expert on major television programmes and served on the board of Physicians for Social Responsibility.<br />
<br />
<strong>Works</strong><br />
<br />
Jill Stein has co-authored two important reports: In Harm's Way: Toxic Threats to Child Development (2000) and Environmental Threats to Healthy Aging (2009). The first report has been translated into four languages and is used globally as a tool for health and environmental justice, linking human health, social justice and green economies.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The CDC has warned travelers about the risks associated with private hot tubs on cruise ships after two outbreaks of Legionnaires disease.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently warned of outbreaks of Legionnaires' disease, a serious form of pneumonia, connected to two cruise ships' private hot tubs. Twelve people were impacted by the outbreaks, which happened between November 2022 and July 2024, according to the CDC's report on October 24.</p>

<p>The <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7342a3.htm">CDC acknowledged</a> in a report that both cruise ships provided European, Caribbean, and Mediterranean routes, but it did not provide the identities of the ships. Since private-use hot tubs were found to be the source of the bacterial illness, the CDC cautions travellers about the health hazards involved.</p>

<p><strong>What is Legionnaires disease?</strong></p>

<p>According to the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7342a3.htm">CDC</a>, Legionnaires disease is a serious pneumonia caused by Legionella bacteria. Hot tubs can be a source of Legionella growth and transmission when they are inadequately maintained and operated.</p>

<p><strong>What is added by this report?</strong></p>

<p>Epidemiologic, environmental, and laboratory evidence suggests that private balcony hot tubs were the likely source of exposure in two outbreaks of Legionnaires disease among cruise ship passengers. These devices are subject to less stringent operating requirements than are public hot tubs, and operating protocols were insufficient to prevent Legionella growth.</p>

<p><strong>What are the implications for public health practice?</strong></p>

<p>It is important for cruise ship operators to inventory hot tub-style devices across their fleets, evaluate the design features that increase the risk for Legionella growth and transmission, and test for Legionella.</p>

<p>Given the range of hot tub-type devices offered as amenities across the cruise industry, to reduce risk for Legionella growth and transmission, it is important for cruise ship water management program staff members to inventory and assess private balcony hot tubs and adapt public hot tub maintenance and operations protocols for use on private outdoor hot tubs.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p dir="ltr">Amid a festive atmosphere, Biden had a series of light-hearted interactions with young visitors, including a humorous moment where he pretended to bite the leg of a baby dressed as a chicken. All the while the iconic theme from&nbsp;Jaws&nbsp;played in the background.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">As evening fell, the couple spent over an hour distributing goodies to up to 8,000 attendees, including local students and families with military backgrounds. President Biden, in a suit and tie, filled children's treat bags with White House-branded Hershey's Kisses, while the First Lady handed out copies of&nbsp;10 Spooky Pumpkins.&nbsp;The White House grounds were decorated with festive decorations, including a large orange moon, stacks of books and cardboard cutouts of Willow, the family's cat.</p>

<p dir="ltr">An Air Force band played spooky tunes throughout the evening.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">On Halloween, former President Donald Trump is <a href="https://www.kob.com/new-mexico/trump-rally-faces-parking-and-venue-issues-in-albuquerque/ " rel="nofollow,noindex">set to visit Albuquerque</a>, New Mexico, to appeal to Latino voters and promote his immigration policies. Despite New Mexico's predominantly Democratic and Hispanic population, Trump aims to leverage recent Republican gains among Latino men. His visit is significant, especially following a rally in New York where inflammatory comments about Puerto Rico were made, raising tensions with Latino communities.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Trump's campaign focuses on New Mexico's proximity to the border and its oil and gas industry, hoping to attract conservative Latinos employed in these sectors. However, Democrats argue that his claims about energy production are misleading, as oil and gas output has increased under President Biden.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The visit will occur at a private venue after the state declined Trump's requests for public spaces due to maintenance claims. Critics, including New Mexico Democratic spokesperson Daniel Garcia, argue that Trump's past actions, including unpaid debts from previous campaign visits, indicate he is unlikely to succeed in swaying voters in the state.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Siemens announced a $10.6 billion deal to buy US engineering software firm Altair Engineering overnight, cheering analysts who see it boosting the company's presence in the fast-growing industrial software market.</p>

<p>Still, there was some concerns about the high price Siemens paid for Michigan-based Altair. The offer price of $113 per share represents a premium of about 18.7% to Altair's close on October 21, a day before Reuters first reported the company was exploring a sale.</p>

<p>The deal is Siemens's biggest acquisition since Siemens Healthineers bought medical device maker Varian Medical Systems for $16.4 billion in 2020.</p>

<p>Analysts at Alpha Wertpapierhandel said the deal, while not cheap, would strengthen Siemens' struggling digital industries division.</p>

<p>"Altair adds AI-powered design and simulation," Alpha said. "All in all, longer term, this seems to be a good deal for Siemens."</p>

<p>Jefferies analyst Simon Toennessen said the acquisition gave Siemens more expertise around artificial intelligence and high performance computers.</p>

<p>It would also make the group a more credible rival to chip-design company Synopsys, which agreed to buy design software firm Ansys earlier this year, as well as Cadence Design Systems</p>

<p>Siemens shares were down 0.8% at 0827 GMT, against a 0.4% decline in the wider index. The share price reaction might be due to the cost of the deal, one trader said.</p>

<p>Altair, whose simulation software helps predict how products would work in the real world, fits Siemens's strategy of using its hardware and software to combine the real and digital worlds.</p>

<p>The German maker of trains and factory equipment has been trying to expand beyond its traditional industrial customers by boosting its digital offering to improve the performance of its production lines, trains and buildings.</p>

<p>The transaction is anticipated to add to Siemens' earnings per share in about two years from the deal's closing, which is expected in the second half of 2025.</p>

<p>It will also increase Siemens' digital business revenue by about 8%, adding approximately 600 million euros ($651.4 million) to the company's digital business revenue in fiscal 2023.</p>

<p>The transaction would have a revenue impact of about $500 million per year in the mid-term and more than $1 billion per year in the long term, Siemens said.</p>

<p>Siemens competes with Rockwell Automation, Emerson Electric and ABB in the industrial software market which is currently worth an estimated $21.5 billion annually and is forecast to grow by 16.7% per year.</p>

<p>Separately on Wednesday, Altair reported a 13% third-quarter rise in revenue to $151.5 million.</p>

<p>Engineering software companies have become attractive acquisition targets as investors bet on companies that could benefit from the boom in artificial intelligence.</p>

<p>In January, Synopsys agreed to buy design software firm Ansys in a $35 billion cash-and-stock deal.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

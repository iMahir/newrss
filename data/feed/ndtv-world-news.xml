       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p>

<p>Pakistan's jailed former prime minister, Imran Khan, who blames the military for his ouster and 12-month-old imprisonment on what he calls trumped-up charges, said on Sunday it would be "foolish" not to have "excellent" relations with the army.</p>

<p>Ahead of Monday's anniversary of his jailing on dozens of charges ranging from corruption to leaking state secrets, Khan also said in written responses to Reuters questions that he held no grudges against the United States, whom he has also blamed for his 2022 ouster from office.</p>

<p>"Given Pakistan's geographical position and the military's significant role in the private sector, it would be foolish not to foster such a relationship," Imran Khan wrote in replies relayed by his media and legal team.</p>

<p>"We are proud of our soldiers and armed forces," he said.</p>

<p>Imran Khan said his criticisms since his ouster had been directed at individuals, not the military as an institution. "The miscalculations of the military leadership shouldn't be held against the institution as a whole."</p>

<p>On Wednesday, Imran Khan offered to hold "conditional negotiations" with the South Asian nation's military - if "clean and transparent" elections were held and the "bogus" cases against his supporters were dropped.</p>

<p>Pakistan's army and government did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Imran Khan's remarks to Reuters. They have both repeatedly denied his assertions.</p>

<p>The United States denies any role in his ouster.</p>

<p>In his replies, the 71-year-old former cricket star did not specify what he wanted to discuss with the military.</p>

<p>'OPEN TO ANY DIALOGUE' WITH ARMY</p>

<p>The army, which has ruled Pakistan for more than half its 76-year independent history, plays an oversized role in the politics and governance of the nation of 240 million people.</p>

<p>No Pakistani prime minister has completed a full five-year term in office, and most have served time in jail. Analysts say most of those secured their release after striking deals with the military, a claim the army denies.</p>

<p>Imran Khan, who lost power in a parliamentary vote of no confidence after falling out with the generals, has said the army has been backing what he calls the politically motivated cases against him, which the military has denied.</p>

<p>Still, he said, there would be "no harm" in engaging with the generals if he should be released from jail and seek to return to power.</p>

<p>"We are open to any dialogue that could help improve the dire situation in Pakistan," he said, adding that it was useless to open any such talks with the coalition government of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, which he says does not enjoy public backing because he claims it won a stolen election in February.</p>

<p>Rather, Imran Khan said, it would be "more productive to engage with those who actually wield power".</p>

<p>The military - which says Imran Khan and his party were behind attacks on military installations last year during widespread protests against his detention - has previously ruled out any talks with him.</p>

<p>Imran Khan's imprisonment has added to the political volatility in Pakistan, which has experienced a prolonged economic crisis and last month received a bailout from the International Monetary Fund.</p>

<p>The political instability since Imran Khan's ouster from power helped force Islamabad to accept the IMF's painful fiscal consolidation requirements, which have burdened the people with heavy taxes, analysts say.</p>

<p>The IMF has called for political stability to help put the $350 billion economy on a recovery path.</p>

<p>Imran Khan rejected the idea of reaching an out-of-court settlement with the government or military, unless they accepted that his PTI party had won a majority in February's election.</p>

<p>"The elections were the most rigged in Pakistan's history," Imran Khan told Reuters.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gaza's civil defence agency said an Israeli strike hit two schools in Gaza City on Sunday, killing at least 30 people, while the military reported it had struck Hamas command centres.</p>

<p>These bring to at least 11 the number of schools in Gaza to be struck since July 6, killing around 150 people, based on a tally of tolls previously given by officials in the Hamas-run territory.</p>

<p>"The number of martyrs in the massacre of the Hassan Salameh and Al-Nasr schools' bombing has risen to 30. Dozens were also wounded," civil defence spokesman Mahmud Bassal told AFP.</p>

<p>Bassal said most of the dead and wounded were women and children.</p>

<p>He said the schools were housing Palestinians displaced from their homes in the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas operatives.</p>

<p>Israel's military confirmed the strike targeting the two schools.</p>

<p>"The schools were used by Hamas' Al-Furqan Battalion as a hiding place for its terrorist operatives and as command centres," the military said in a statement.</p>

<p>On Saturday, a similar Israeli strike hit another school compound in Gaza City, killing at least 17 people, according to the civil defence agency.</p>

<p>The Israeli military has repeatedly accused Hamas of using civilian facilities as command and control centres or to hide their commanders and operatives. The Palestinian group denies the accusation.</p>

<p>The war in Gaza began when Hamas operatives attacked Israel on October 7, resulting in the death of 1,197 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.</p>

<p>Operatives also seized 251 people, 111 of whom are still held hostage in Gaza, including 39 the military says are dead.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory military campaign has killed at least 39,583 people, according to the territory's health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza, which does not give details of civilian and operative deaths.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ukrainian pilots have started flying F-16s for operations within the nation, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Sunday, confirming the long-awaited arrival of the U.S.-made fighter jets more than 29 months since Russia's invasion.</p>

<p>The Ukrainian leader announced the use of F-16s, which Kyiv has long lobbied for, as he met military pilots at an air base flanked by two of the jets with two more flying overhead.</p>

<p>"F-16s are in Ukraine. We did it. I am proud of our guys who are mastering these jets and have already started using them for our country," Zelensky said at a location that authorities asked Reuters not to disclose for security reasons.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">We are now in a new phase of development for the Air Force of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. We have done a lot to transition the Ukrainian Air Force to a new aviation standard – Western combat aviation. From the beginning of this war, we have been talking with our partners about… <a href="https://t.co/z21yTU0Hjo">pic.twitter.com/z21yTU0Hjo</a></p>
— Volodymyr Zelenskyy / Володимир Зеленський (@ZelenskyyUa) <a href="https://twitter.com/ZelenskyyUa/status/1820097797556765019?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 4, 2024</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>The arrival of the jets is a milestone for Ukraine after many months of waiting, though it remains unclear how many are available and how much of an impact they will have in enhancing air defences and on the battlefield.</p>

<p>Russia has been targeting bases that may house them and vowed to shoot them down so they will not impact the war.</p>

<p>Built by Lockheed Martin, the F-16s had been on Ukraine's wish list for a long time because of their destructive power and global availability. They are equipped with a 20mm cannon and can carry bombs, rockets and missiles.</p>

<p>Talking to reporters on the tarmac of an airfield, Zelenskiy said Ukraine still did not have enough pilots trained to use the F-16s or enough of the jets themselves.</p>

<p>"The positive thing is that we are expecting additional F-16s ... many guys are now training," he said.</p>

<p>It was important, he said, that Kyiv's allies found ways to expand training programmes and opportunities for both Ukrainian pilots and engineering teams.</p>

<p><strong>'NEW AVIATION STANDARD'</strong></p>

<p>Ukraine has previously relied on an ageing fleet of Soviet-era warplanes that are outgunned by Russia's more advanced and far more numerous fleet.</p>

<p>Russia has used that edge to conduct regular long-range missile strikes on targets across Ukraine and also to pound Ukrainian front line positions with thousands of guided bombs, supporting its forces that are slowly advancing in the east.</p>

<p>"This is the new stage of development of the air force of Ukraine's armed forces," Zelensky said.</p>

<p>"We did a lot for Ukrainian forces to transition to a new aviation standard, the Western combat aviation," he added, citing hundreds of meetings and unrelenting diplomacy to obtain the F-16s.</p>

<p>"We often heard 'it is impossible' as an answer but we still made our ambition, our defensive need, possible," he said.</p>

<p>It remains unclear what missiles the jets are equipped with. A longer range of missile would allow them to have a greater battlefield impact, military analysts say.</p>

<p>Zelensky said he also hoped to lobby allied neighbouring countries to help intercept Russian missiles being launched at Ukraine through conversations at the Ukraine-NATO Council platform.</p>

<p>"This is another tool, and I want to try it, so that NATO countries can talk to Ukraine about the possibility of a small coalition of neighbouring countries shooting down enemy missiles," he said.</p>

<p>"I think this decision is probably difficult for our partners, they are always afraid of excessive escalation but we are fighting that."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Jobs decided not to follow Mr Buffett's advice. "He didn't do anything, and of course, he didn't want to do anything. He just liked having the cash."]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Following the release of Apple's Q3 earnings report, which exceeded expectations, a story from 2012 has resurfaced about Steve Jobs seeking investment advice from legendary American investor Warren Buffett regarding Apple's cash reserves.</p>

<p>In a 2012 interview with <em>CNBC</em>, Mr Buffett recalled a memorable phone call he had with Mr Jobs two years prior. "It was an interesting conversation because I hadn't talked to him in a long time," said the Berkshire Hathaway chairman. Mr Jobs had reached out for advice on managing Apple's significant cash reserves. "He said, 'We've got all this cash. What should we do with it?' So we went over the options."</p>

<p>Mr Buffett explained that companies typically have four choices for utilizing cash: stock buybacks, dividends, acquisitions, or holding onto it. Mr Jobs made it clear that Apple wouldn't pursue large acquisitions requiring substantial cash.</p>

<p>"I went through the logic of each option. He told me they would not have the opportunity for big acquisitions that would require lots of money," Mr Buffett said during the interview. When Buffett suggested stock buybacks if Apple believed its stock was undervalued, Mr Jobs replied, "I think my stock is very undervalued."</p>

<p>Ultimately, Mr Jobs decided not to follow Mr Buffett's advice. "He didn't do anything, and of course, he didn't want to do anything. He just liked having the cash," Mr Buffett said with a laugh. "It was very interesting to me because I later learned that he said I agreed with him to do nothing with the cash."</p>

<p>Earlier this year, Bill Gates, the founder of Microsoft in an interview with Dax Shepard said, "Steve Jobs was a natural. It was always fun to watch him rehearse because part of his genius was when he would finally do it, he would make it look like he's just thinking it up right there," he said. &nbsp;"I'll never achieve that level," Mr Gates added.</p>

<p>During the podcast, Mr Gates stated that he and Mr Jobs were travelling the world in their respective capacities as representatives of Microsoft and Apple and that their task was to convince individuals and organisations of the potential benefits that tools like spreadsheets and email could have for their daily lives and careers.</p>

<p>"We even called it evangelization. Some people might not like that we stole a term of religion, but telling the story of the magic of software is something that - certainly by the time I was in my 30s - was a big part of the job," he said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Scientists emphasize the urgent need for immediate and drastic action to mitigate climate change and potentially stave off this catastrophic tipping point.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>New scientific research paints a stark and alarming picture: the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), a crucial oceanic current system regulating global climate, is on the brink of collapse. This impending disaster, accelerated by human-induced climate change, could occur as early as the late 2030s, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/08/02/climate/atlantic-circulation-collapse-timing/index.html"><em>CNN </em></a>reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The consequences of an AMOC shutdown are profound and far-reaching. A dramatic shift in global weather patterns is expected, including extreme weather events, altered precipitation patterns, and disruptions to agriculture. Europe and North America could experience significant temperature drops, while regions like the Amazon rainforest face drastic changes in seasonal weather.</p>

<p>"This is really worrying," said Rene van Westen, a marine and atmospheric researcher at the University of Utrecht in the Netherlands and study co-author.</p>

<p>"All the negative side effects of anthropogenic climate change, they will still continue to go on, like more heat waves, more droughts, more flooding," he told CNN. "Then if you also have on top of that an AMOC collapse ... the climate will become even more distorted."</p>

<p>The implications for ecosystems and human societies are equally severe. Marine life reliant on the AMOC for nutrient distribution will be jeopardized, and coastal communities face increased risks from rising sea levels and intensified storms.</p>

<p>An AMOC collapse “is a really big danger that we should do everything we can to avoid,” said Stefan Rahmstorf, a physical oceanographer at Potsdam University in Germany who was not involved in the latest research.</p>

<p>Scientists emphasize the urgent need for immediate and drastic action to mitigate climate change and potentially stave off this catastrophic tipping point. The world is at a crossroads, and the decisions made today will determine the planet's future.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Police arrested dozens of people after protests across parts of England and Northern Ireland turned violent on Saturday, as the government pledged tough action against those it said were exploiting the murder of three girls to stir up disorder.</p>

<p>Violent protests involving hundreds of anti-immigration groups have erupted in towns and cities across Britain after three girls were killed in a knife attack at a children's dance class in Southport in north-west England last week.</p>

<p>The murders were seized on by anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim groups as misinformation spread that the suspect was a radical Islamist migrant. Police have said the suspect was born in Britain. Media reports have said his family was Christian.</p>

<p>On Saturday, violent disorder broke out in cities around the country, including Liverpool, Bristol, Hull and Stoke-on-Trent, as well as the town of Blackpool, with local police saying they had arrested at least 87 people. There was also unrest in Manchester and Belfast.</p>

<p>Shops and businesses were vandalised and looted, a library in Liverpool was set on fire and several police were injured, police statements said.</p>

<p>"Criminal violence and thuggery on our streets will not be tolerated," interior minister Yvette Cooper said late on Saturday.</p>

<p>"Police forces have my full support in ensuring that those who engage in criminal disorder face the strongest possible penalties."</p>

<p>Saturday's protests were the most widespread after several days of disorder following the murders. Prime Minister Keir Starmer has said they are the result of deliberate actions by the far-right, co-ordinated by a "group of individuals who are absolutely bent on violence," rather than legitimate protest.</p>

<p>The last time violent protests erupted across Britain was in 2011 when thousands of people took to the streets after police shot dead a Black man in London.</p>

<p>There are more demonstrations planned for Sunday, based on messages circulating on social media.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The book claims that Mr Gates "flirted with some of the interns at the Gates Foundation, putting them in an uncomfortable position."]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A forthcoming book is set to ignite controversy surrounding Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates. Author Anupreeta Das alleges that Mr Gates engaged in inappropriate behaviour towards multiple women, prompting Microsoft to institute measures to protect young interns from being alone with him, the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/08/02/business/bill-gates-tell-all-book-claims-microsoft-banned-young-interns-from-being-alone-with-flirty-mogul-before-divorce-kid-in-a-candy-store/"><em>New York Post </em></a>reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The book paints a picture of a man who, despite his philanthropic image, exhibited a pattern of unwanted advances and flirtatious conduct towards employees and interns alike.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The book claims that Bill Gates “flirted with some of the interns at the Gates Foundation, putting them in the uncomfortable position of having to think about their career prospects while not wanting to be hit on by the boss."</p>

<p>However, a former Microsoft executive told the author that Mr Gates did not “prey on” women or ask for sexual favours in exchange for career advancement. “He's not Harvey Weinstein… I know of no real situation in which anyone got anything for sleeping with Bill.”</p>

<p>A spokesperson for Bill Gates denied the allegations. “Relying almost exclusively on second- and third-hand hearsay and anonymous sources, the book includes highly sensationalized allegations and outright falsehoods that ignore the actual documented facts our office provided to the author on numerous occasions,” the spokesperson said in a statement provided to the New York Post.</p>

<p>These alleged actions are said to have deeply impacted Mr Gates' marriage to Melinda French Gates. The book claims that she grew increasingly concerned about her husband's behaviour, leading her to take proactive steps, including a reorganization of his security detail and restrictions on his access to personal contact information.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The couple's eventual divorce is partly attributed to the ongoing strain caused by these issues, as well as Gates' continued association with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.</p>

<p>The allegations have been met with staunch denial from Gates and his representatives, who characterize the book's claims as sensationalized and unfounded. However, the accusations are likely to spark intense public scrutiny and debate about the behaviour of powerful figures.</p>

<p>The book is set to hit stores on August 13.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Palestinian attacker killed two people and wounded two others in a stabbing spree in central Israel on Sunday before being shot dead by police, Israeli authorities said.</p>

<p>The stabbings took place during morning rush hour in the city of Holon, near Tel Aviv. The attacker stabbed people near a gas station and a park, Israel's ambulance service said.</p>

<p>Two senior citizens, a man and woman, were killed and two other people were wounded and rushed to hospital, medical officials said.</p>

<p>"The terrorist was quickly neutralized by one of our officers at the scene and prevented him from carrying out an even worse attack," police spokesperson Eli Levi said on Israel's Channel 12.</p>

<p>A police statement said police were present in force at the scene and were "conducting extensive searches with a helicopter and additional resources".</p>

<p>The Islamist group Hamas, which is at war with Israel in Gaza, said in a statement that the stabbing attack was a "natural response" to Israeli attacks on Palestinians and to the assassination of the group's leader, Ismail Haniyeh, last week in Tehran.</p>

<p>However, it stopped short of claiming responsibility for Sunday's attack.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Urgent calls for foreign nationals to leave Lebanon grew on Sunday with France warning of "a highly volatile" situation as Iran and its allies ready their response to high-profile killings blamed on Israel.</p>

<p>Lebanon's Iran-backed Hezbollah movement, which has traded near-daily fire with Israeli forces since the Gaza war broke out in October, announced its fighters had fired a barrage of rockets at Israel's north overnight.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said 30 projectiles were launched from Lebanon, with most of them intercepted.</p>

<p>With Israel on high alert anticipating major military action from Tehran-aligned armed groups including Hezbollah and Hamas, medics and police said two people were killed on Sunday in a stabbing attack in a Tel Aviv suburb.</p>

<p>The assailant, a Palestinian from the occupied West Bank, was "neutralised" by police and taken to hospital, where he was pronounced dead.</p>

<p>Israeli forces meanwhile kept bombarding the Gaza Strip, witnesses and officials in the besieged Hamas-ruled territory said, with no end in sight to the nearly 10-month war triggered by the Palestinian group's October 7 attack on southern Israel.</p>

<p>France, Canada and Jordan were among the latest governments to call for their citizens to leave Lebanon.</p>

<p>"In a highly volatile security context", French nationals were "urgently asked" to avoid travelling to Lebanon, and those already in the country "to make their arrangements now to leave... as soon as possible", the foreign ministry in Paris said.</p>

<p>The United States and Britain have issued similar warnings.</p>

<p>France on Sunday also urged its nationals living in Iran to "temporarily leave", warning Iranian airspace and airports could close.</p>

<p>Several Western airlines have suspended flights to Lebanon and other airports in the region.</p>

<p>On Sunday Qatar Airways said the Doha-Beirut route would "operate exclusively during daylight hours" at least until Monday.</p>

<p>The killing Wednesday of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, hours after the Israeli assassination of Hezbollah's military chief in Beirut, has triggered vows of vengeance from Iran and the so-called "axis of resistance" of Tehran-backed armed groups.</p>

<p>Israel, accused by Hamas, Iran and others of carrying out the attack that killed Haniyeh, has not directly commented on it.</p>

<p><strong>Tents for displaced hit</strong></p>

<p>Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas in retaliation for its unprecedented October 7 attack which resulted in the deaths of 1,197 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures.</p>

<p>Operatives also seized 251 hostages, 111 of whom are still held captive in Gaza, including 39 the military says are dead.</p>

<p>Israel's campaign against Hamas has killed at least 39,583 people in Gaza, according to the territory's health ministry, which does not give details of civilian and operative deaths.</p>

<p>Haniyeh, Hamas's political chief, was the group's lead negotiator in efforts to end the war.</p>

<p>His killing raised questions about the continued viability of efforts by Qatari, Egyptian and US mediators to broker a truce and exchange of hostages and prisoners.</p>

<p>On the ground in Gaza, fighting continued on Sunday, with strikes, shelling and gunfire reported in and around Gaza City and in the territory's south.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said its air forces had struck "approximately 50 terror targets throughout the Gaza Strip" in the past 24 hours.</p>

<p>The Palestinian Red Crescent said eight bodies had been recovered from a residential building in north Gaza's Jabalia refugee camp after an Israeli air strike.</p>

<p>Medics at central Gaza's Al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital said at least five people were killed and 16 wounded in an Israeli drone strike on tents housing displaced Palestinians at the medical complex, with a separate attack on a house nearby in the same area killing three.</p>

<p>On Saturday, an Israeli strike on a school turned displacement shelter killed at least 17 people, the civil defence agency said. Israel said the facility was used by operatives.</p>

<p><strong>War 'without constraints'</strong></p>

<p>Analysts have told AFP that a joint but measured action from Iran and its allies was likely, while Tehran said it expects Hezbollah to hit deeper inside Israel and no longer be confined to military targets.</p>

<p>Israeli ally the United States said it would move warships and fighter jets to the region.</p>

<p>US President Joe Biden, asked by reporters if he thought Iran would stand down, said: "I hope so. I don't know."</p>

<p>Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi was due in Tehran for a rare visit to discuss "the situation in the region", Amman said.</p>

<p>The Israeli military was "determined to continue fighting until we fundamentally change the security situation in the north", said Home Front Command chief Rafi Gilo.</p>

<p>"We... are prepared for any scenario and any response", Gilo said according to an army statement.</p>

<p>Haniyeh's killing "has brought the Middle East to its moment of greatest peril in years", the International Crisis Group (ICG) think tank said in a report issued on Saturday.</p>

<p>The potential for a miscalculation that would trigger a war "without constraints... is likely greater now than it was in April", it added.</p>

<p>On April 13, Iran fired a barrage of drones and missiles at Israel -- most of which were intercepted -- after a deadly strike on Tehran's consulate in Damascus.</p>

<p>The ICG said that securing "a long overdue ceasefire" in Gaza was "the best way of meaningfully reducing tensions in the region".</p>

<p>Hamas officials but also some analysts as well as protesters in Israel have accused Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of prolonging the war to safeguard his ruling hard-right coalition.</p>

<p>On Sunday, Netanyahu told his cabinet he was "making every effort" to return the hostages and was prepared "to go a long way" to do so.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">US President Joe Biden reportedly told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to “stop bulls***ting me” during a tense phone conversation on Thursday.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">The sharp exchange came after Mr Netanyahu informed Joe Biden that Israel was proceeding with negotiations on a hostages-for-ceasefire deal with Hamas, despite months of unfruitful talks. Biden has previously expressed suspicions that Netanyahu has been intentionally stalling for internal political reasons, <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/stop-bullshitting-me-biden-said-to-scold-netanyahu-in-call-on-truce-hostage-deal/ ">Channel 12</a> reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">At the end of the call, Mr Biden added a stern warning, “Don't take the president for granted.” Joe Biden also reportedly criticised the timing of the killing of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Iran, calling it “poorly timed.”&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">The US President reportedly was concerned that the operation jeopardised the potential culmination of ceasefire and hostage release negotiations, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/03/us/politics/us-israel-hamas-assassination.html ">NY Times</a> reported. An unnamed US official indicated that Biden warned the assassination could lead to a broader regional conflict which Biden had been putting efforts to prevent.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">Netanyahu's office issued a<a href="http:// https://www.timesofisrael.com/stop-bullshitting-me-biden-said-to-scold-netanyahu-in-call-on-truce-hostage-deal/ "> statement</a> on Saturday night that said that “Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu does not discuss what was said in closed conversations with the President of the US.”&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">Tensions in the Middle East have surged to a boiling point following the recent killings of senior Hezbollah leader Faud Shukr and Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh. Iran-backed Hezbollah retaliated by launching dozens of rockets at northern Israel on Sunday, with some breaching defenses in the Beit Hillel region.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">A clip shared on X shows Israel's Iron Dome batteries firing multiple Tamir interceptors at Hezbollah rockets targeting the Jewish State.&nbsp;</p>

<p>US defense officials have arrived in Israel, bracing for potential retaliation from Iran and its allies. The Pentagon has bolstered its regional military presence in anticipation of further escalation.</p>

<p>Israel has neither confirmed nor denied involvement in the killings, which have sparked fears of a coordinated attack by Iran and Hezbollah. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu has warned of "challenging days ahead" and vowed to be "prepared for any scenario."&nbsp;US President Biden hopes Iran will stand down despite its threats.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Indian Embassy in Beirut has advised Indian nationals against travelling to or staying in Lebanon until further notice.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

	<li>"All Indian nationals including students living in the jurisdiction of the Assistant High Commission of India, Sylhet are requested to be in touch with this office and are advised to remain alert. In case of emergencies, please contact +88-01313076402," the Assistant High Commission said in a post on X.</li>
	<li>The protests over government jobs quota restarted today with demands for Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's resignation. Fourteen policemen were among those killed, news agency AFP reported.</li>
	<li>Just days ago, over 200 people were killed in violent clashes between the police and mostly student protesters demanding an end to the controversial quota system that reserved 30 per cent of government jobs for relatives of veterans who fought in Bangladesh's War of Independence in 1971.</li>
	<li>The clashes broke out this morning when protesters attending a non-cooperation programme to demand the government's resignation faced opposition from the supporters of the Awami League, Chhatra League, and Jubo League activists, news agency PTI reported.</li>
	<li>The Bangladesh Home Ministry decided to impose an indefinite countrywide curfew from 6 pm today. Prime Minister Hasina said that those engaging in sabotage across Bangladesh in the name of protests are not students but terrorists and asked people to suppress them with a firm hand.</li>
	<li>Ms Hasina called a meeting of the National Committee on Security Affairs at Ganabhaban. "I appeal to the countrymen to suppress these terrorists with a firm hand," she said. The meeting was attended by the chiefs of the army, navy, air force, police and other agencies.</li>
	<li>In Rangpur, four Awami League supporters were killed and over 100 people injured while two people were killed each in Bogra and Magura, where a Chhatra Dal leader was among the dead, local media reported,</li>
	<li>The protesters under the banner of the Anti-Discrimination Students Movement chanted slogans calling for Ms Hasina's resignation and justice for those killed in the recent violence surrounding the quota reform protests, Bdnews24 news portal reported.</li>
	<li>According to the Daily Star newspaper, several vehicles at Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU) were torched on Sunday by unidentified people. People carrying sticks were seen vandalising cars, ambulances, motorcycles, and buses.</li>
	<li>The protesters have dismissed Ms Hasina's invitation for dialogue aimed at quelling escalating violence and consolidated their demands into a unified call for the government's resignation.</li>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two people were killed Sunday and two others wounded in a stabbing attack near Tel Aviv, Israeli medics said, with police reporting a Palestinian suspect was "neutralised" and later died in hospital.</p>

<p>The Magen David Adom emergency service said in a statement that the "terrorist attack" took place in several locations in Holon, a southern suburb of Israel's commercial hub of Tel Aviv.</p>

<p>It comes at a moment of heightened tension in Israel and the wider Middle East, nearly 10 months into the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip.</p>

<p>The stabbing suspect, from the Israeli-occupied West Bank, was "neutralised" by a police officer who arrived at the scene, the force said in a statement without elaborating.</p>

<p>The Shamir Medical Centre said the assailant was pronounced dead shortly after being taken to the hospital near Holon in a critical condition.</p>

<p>A 66-year-old woman and a man aged around 80 were badly wounded and died from their injuries shortly after the attack, the Wolfson hospital in the city said.</p>

<p>Israeli news website Ynet said the pair, whose ages Magen David Adom earlier gave as 70, were married.</p>

<p>Two other men were wounded, the emergency service said.</p>

<p>A 68-year-old was in serious condition and a 26-year-old was moderately wounded.</p>

<p>"This was a complex and difficult terrorist attack, with the victims located in three different places, around 500 metres (yards) from each other," Magen David Adom said.</p>

<p>Regional tensions have soared as Iran and Middle East armed groups it backs threatened retaliation for the assassination of Hamas political chief Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran on Wednesday, which they blame on Israel, and an Israeli strike in Beirut hours earlier that killed top Hezbollah commander Fuad Shukr.</p>

<p>Israel's National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir visited the scene of Sunday's attack, where he told journalists: "Our war is not only against Iran, but also here in the streets".</p>

<p>"This is why we have armed the Israeli population with more than 150,000 gun permits," said the far-right politician who has loosened gun laws and repeatedly called on ordinary Israelis to carry arms.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thousands of Bangladeshi protesters, many wielding sticks, crowded into a central Dhaka square Sunday for mass protests demanding Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina resign following a deadly police crackdown.</p>

<p>Asif Mahmud, one of the key protest leaders in a nationwide civil disobedience campaign, asked supporters to be ready to fight.</p>

<p>"Prepare bamboo sticks and liberate Bangladesh," he wrote on Facebook on Sunday.</p>

<p>While the army stepped in to help restore order in the wake of earlier protests, some former military officers have since joined the student movement, and ex-army chief General Ikbal Karim Bhuiyan turned his Facebook profile picture red in a show of support.</p>

<p>Current army chief Waker-uz-Zaman spoke to officers at military headquarters in Dhaka on Saturday, telling them the "Bangladesh Army is the symbol of trust of the people".</p>

<p>"It always stood by the people and will do so for the sake of people and in any need of the state," he said, according to an army statement issued late Saturday.</p>

<p>The statement did not give further details, and did not explicitly say whether the army backed the protests.</p>

<p>Rallies against civil service job quotas sparked days of mayhem in July that killed more than 200 people in some of the worst unrest of Hasina's 15-year tenure.</p>

<p>Troops briefly restored order but crowds returned to the streets in huge numbers this week in an all-out non-cooperation movement aimed at paralysing the government.</p>

<p>On Saturday, when hundreds of thousands of protesters marched in Dhaka, the police were largely bystanders watching the rallies.</p>

<p>'Live freely'</p>

<p>The protests have grown into a wider anti-government movement across the South Asian nation of some 170 million people.</p>

<p>The mass movement includes people from all strata of Bangladesh society, including film stars, musicians and singers, and rap songs calling for people's support have spread widely on social media.</p>

<p>"It is no longer about job quotas," said Sakhawat, a young female protester who gave only one name, as she scrawled graffiti on a wall at a protest site in Dhaka calling Hasina a "killer".</p>

<p>"What we want is that our next generation can live freely in the country."</p>

<p>Counter-protests supporting the government are also expected.</p>

<p>Obaidul Quader, general secretary of Hasina's ruling Awami League, has called on party activists to gather in "all wards in Dhaka city" and "in every district" nationwide to show their support for the government.</p>

<p>"We don't want to engage in any kind of confrontation," Quader said.</p>

<p>The capital Dhaka was tense on Sunday, with fewer cars and buses on the normally congested streets of the megacity of 20 million people.</p>

<p>Hundreds of thousands of protesters are expected to rally in Dhaka and nationwide.</p>

<p>'Take all preparations'</p>

<p>Students Against Discrimination, the group responsible for organising the initial protests, called for rallies across the country.</p>

<p>Protests will be held at entry points to Dhaka, with the main rallies held in Dhaka's central Shahbagh Square, where crowds gathered on Sunday morning.</p>

<p>"We will hold our protests and rallies peacefully," the group said in a statement late Saturday. "But if anyone attacks us, we urge (all) to take all preparations."</p>

<p>Students Against Discrimination have asked their compatriots to stop paying taxes and utility bills from Sunday to pile pressure on the government.</p>

<p>They have also asked government workers and labourers in the country's economically vital garment factories to strike.</p>

<p>Hasina, 76, has ruled Bangladesh since 2009 and won her fourth consecutive election in January after a vote without genuine opposition.</p>

<p>Her government is accused by rights groups of misusing state institutions to entrench its hold on power and stamp out dissent, including through the extrajudicial killing of opposition activists.</p>

<p>Demonstrations began in early July over the reintroduction of the quota scheme, which reserved more than half of all government jobs for certain groups. It has since been scaled back by Bangladesh's top court.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In what is being described as a milestone in Indo-US partnership in the science and technology sphere, US space agency NASA is set to welcome two Indian astronauts for the Axiom-4 spaceflight mission that will send four astronauts to the International Space Station.</p>

<p>ISRO has sent Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla and Group Captain Prasanth Balakrishnan Nair - part of India's Gaganyaan Mission - for training at Axiom Space and NASA's Kennedy Space Center. While Group Captain Shukla is the primary astronaut for the Axiom mission, Group Captain Nair is the back-up astronaut for the project.</p>

<p><strong>What Is the Mission</strong></p>

<p>The Axiom-4 mission, which will use the Falcon-9 rocket of Space-X and the Crew Dragon space module, aims to fly four astronauts to space. The launch is likely to take place next year if all works according to plan. The four astronauts include an American, a Hungarian and, Polish national and Indian.</p>

<p>The Indian astronauts - also called Gaganyatris - are Air Force pilots with extensive flying experience. They have also been trained as cosmonauts in Russia.</p>

<p>Senator Bill Nelson, administrator of NASA said, "We look forward to welcoming the first ISRO astronaut to the International Space Station! This is a monumental step forward for U.S.-India partnership in space."</p>

<p>Ken Bowersox, associate administrator of NASA's Space Operations Mission Directorate, said NASA is opening up space to more nations and people. "We look forward to welcoming the first ISRO astronaut to the International Space Station," he said. "The space station continues to serve as humanity's home in microgravity where we are advancing human spaceflight, enabling science, and improving life on Earth for the benefit of humanity," he added.</p>

<p><strong>Big Shift In NASA-ISRO Ties</strong></p>

<p>This collaboration between NASA and ISRO represents a seismic shift from the US' equations with the Indian space agency in the 1990s. At that point, the US administration did everything to block the transfer of sophisticated cryogenic technology to power Indian rockets. It also imposed sanctions on ISRO after the 1998 Pokhran nuclear tests.</p>

<p>The big thaw in ties came about in 2008 when India flew two NASA instruments on-board Chandrayaan-1 for free. ISRO at the time was still on US' technology denial list.</p>

<p>India did not charge any travel ticket to NASA for ferrying its instruments all the way 384,000 kilometres away to the orbit of the moon. This partnership and India's large heartedness resulted in the changing the geological history of the moon once and for all, with the joint discovery of the presence of water molecules, on what was till then considered a parched lunar surface. Since then, the two countries have not looked back, as the world's oldest democracy and the world's largest democracy have been forging deeper ties and reaching for the stars.</p>

<p><strong>The Axiom Role</strong></p>

<p>Axiom Space, a commercial company that is acting as an intermediary between ISRO and NASA, has said in a statement that it had signed a "historic" spaceflight agreement with ISRO, announcing the intent to fly an Indian astronaut to the International Space Station on Axiom Mission 4. It must be clarified that having a commercial intermediary is the US's call, not ISRO's.</p>

<p>Axiom Space has helped fly three private and commercial missions to the International Space Station in 2022, 2023, 2024. It has said that the signing of the agreement for Mission 4 "represents a pivotal moment for both the United States and India, exemplifying a shared commitment to expanding collaboration and capabilities, fuelling invention and innovation, and inspiring a new generation of space explorers".</p>

<p>"India's journey through space is filled with incredible achievements," said Matt Ondler, president of Axiom Space. "From the successful Chandrayaan missions to the ambitious Gaganyaan project, India has become a beacon of inspiration in the global space community."</p>

<p>"As space becomes a key arena for commercial and scientific efforts, India, with its rich history in space exploration and clear leadership in technology and entrepreneurship, will be crucial in shaping the domain and advancing humanity's presence in space," he said, adding, "We look forward to working together with ISRO on this next mission."</p>

<p>This new space collaboration between US and India also opens up possibilities of a partnership on US' ambitious Artemis program to inhabit the Moon.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[During the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, Germany, 11 Israeli athletes were killed by members of the Palestinian terrorist organisation Black September.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>During the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, Germany, 11 Israeli athletes were killed by members of the Palestinian terrorist organisation Black September. In response, Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir secretly ordered Mossad, Israel's elite intelligence agency, to track down and eliminate those responsible for the massacre.</p>

<p>Over the next seven years, a covert campaign known as "Operation Wrath of God" targeted and assassinated more than a dozen suspects across Europe and the Middle East. This clandestine operation, involving a specially trained hit-team known as 'kidon' (Hebrew for bayonet), has been the subject of numerous books, documentaries and is the central theme of Steven Spielberg's film "Munich".</p>

<h2><strong>The Munich Massacre</strong></h2>

<p>On September 5, 1972, eight members of Black September infiltrated the Olympic Village in Munich. Armed with AK-47s, they took 11 Israeli athletes and coaches hostage, killing two in the initial assault. The terrorists demanded the release of 234 prisoners from Israeli jails. The standoff lasted for hours, during which German authorities attempted negotiations. The terrorists then moved to an airfield where they were told that two Bell UH-1 military helicopters would take them to Cairo. A botched rescue attempt by German police resulted in the deaths of all remaining hostages, a German police officer, and five of the terrorists.</p>

<h2><strong>Operation Wrath Of God</strong></h2>

<p>In the aftermath of the Munich massacre, Prime Minister Golda Meir, along with Mossad chief Zvi Zamir and counterterrorism adviser Aharon Yariv, devised a plan to eliminate the leadership of Black September and other related terrorist groups. This clandestine mission involved conducting assassinations on foreign soil, which carried massive political and ethical implications. The Israeli leadership believed that decisive action was necessary to prevent future attacks and to deliver justice for the Munich victims.</p>

<h2><strong>Planning the Operation</strong></h2>

<p>A special unit within Mossad, known as 'kidon', was tasked with carrying out the assassinations. This unit comprised highly trained assassins skilled in various forms of combat and covert operations.<br />
The list of targets included key figures believed to be responsible for planning and executing the Munich attack, as well as other high-ranking members of Black September and the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO). The aim was to "smash the head of the serpent" by eliminating its leadership.</p>

<h2><strong>The Assassinations</strong></h2>

<p>Over the next several years, Mossad operatives carried out a series of high-profile assassinations across Europe and the Middle East. Some of the most notable operations include:</p>

<p><strong>1. Wael Zwaiter</strong></p>

<p>The first target was Wael Zwaiter, a Palestinian poet and translator living in Rome. Mossad believed he was the head of Black September in Italy and involved in the Munich attack. On October 16, 1972, two Mossad operatives ambushed Zwaiter in the lobby of his apartment building and shot him 11 times. However, it later emerged that the intelligence on Zwaiter was uncorroborated, and his connection to the Munich massacre was questionable.</p>

<p><strong>2. Mahmoud Hamshari</strong></p>

<p>Mahmoud Hamshari, the PLO representative in France, was another key target. Mossad operatives tracked him to his Paris apartment and, posing as journalists, managed to plant a bomb in his telephone. On December 8, 1972, they detonated the bomb, killing Hamshari.</p>

<p><strong>3. Hussein Al Bashir</strong></p>

<p>Hussein Al Bashir, a PLO operative based in Cyprus, was targeted next. On January 24, 1973, Mossad agents planted a bomb under his bed in a Nicosia hotel. The explosion killed Bashir instantly.</p>

<p><strong>4. The Beirut Operation</strong></p>

<p>One of the most daring operations took place in Beirut on April 10, 1973. Mossad operatives, along with Israeli commandos from the elite Sayeret Matkal unit, infiltrated Beirut disguised as women. The operation targeted three key figures: Mohammed Youssef al-Najjar, Kamal Adwan, and Kamal Nasser. The hit squad, including Ehud Barak, who later became Prime Minister of Israel, managed to reach their targets' homes and eliminate them.</p>

<p><strong>5. Ali Hassan Salameh</strong></p>

<p>Ali Hassan Salameh, known as the "Red Prince," was one of Mossad's most elusive targets. Salameh was the chief of operations for Black September and a close associate of former PLO chief Yasser Arafat. After a failed attempt in Norway, where it mistakenly killed an innocent Moroccan waiter named Ahmed Bouchikhi, Mossad intensified its efforts to locate Salameh. The breakthrough came in 1979 when an undercover operative, who had befriended Salameh and his wife, provided information. On January 22, 1979, Salameh was killed by a car bomb in Beirut.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[GLAAD supported the expenditure, and the chair of its board of directors declared that the board "stands firmly behind" Ellis.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The President and CEO of GLAAD Sarah Kate Ellis is facing criticism following a shocking <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/01/business/glaad-ceo-spending.html"><em>New York Times</em> </a>report that claimed she had lavished spending, including taking a $22,000 first-class ticket to the Cannes Lions and remodelling her home office with money from the non-profit LGBTQ advocacy organisation.</p>

<p>The investigation that dug into payments between January 2022 and June 2023 claims that Ellis' spending habits might be against Internal Revenue Service regulations in addition to those of the LGBTQ organization. The 52-year-old spending habits also worried the company's former chief financial officer.</p>

<p>According to NYT, GLAAD's internal travel guidelines advised staff to "be cost-conscious," take public transit and book economy flights. However, when examining GLAAD expense reports, employment contracts, tax returns, and additional documentation, the outlet discovered that the CEO had taken more than 30 first-class flights over one and a half years (including a $21,743 Delta One trip to Cannes Lions), spent nearly half a million dollars to rent a seven-bedroom chalet in Switzerland for a week while attending the World Economic Forum in Davos, and private transportation services. Further, her renewal contract included $25,000 for the rental of a summer home in Provincetown, Massachusetts, and $20,000 for remodelling her home office which included ivory pillows and a chandler.</p>

<p>A GLAAD representative told NYT that the renovation made the area "suitable" for virtual events and television appearances. All of these costs were on top of Ellis' yearly salary, which was stated to be $441,000. However, because of numerous bonuses, his actual remuneration could have ranged from $700,000 to $1.3 million. Richard Ferraro, a GLAAD spokesman, informed the outlet that GLAAD was "eager to retain her" as a result of her accomplishment and that it would be "practically impossible" to reach the latter sum.</p>

<p>In 2023, GLAAD's then-chief financial officer, Emily Plauche warned Liz Jenkins, the chairwoman of the company's board of directors that the money was not being disclosed properly to the Internal Revenue Service. However, the organization modified its travel regulations following an investigation by a law firm into her concerns.</p>

<p>GLAAD supported the expenditure, and the chair of its board of directors declared that the board "stands firmly behind" Ellis. They stated that the home renovation was done because of her on-camera appearances and virtual events during the Covid-19 pandemic and it was approved by the board of directors. Meanwhile, the rental of the summer home was a business expense to conduct meetings with donors.</p>

<p>The spokesperson also highlighted GLAAD's criticism of NYT, claiming that the newspaper publishes "inaccurate, biased pieces about transgender people" throughout a year-long campaign. In its report, the NYT accepted this criticism and affirmed the quality of its work.</p>

<p>The chairwoman said that she supports Ellis "with respect and appreciation for how she and her team are leading the movement at a time when our community is under attack. We have full confidence that they're doing so with integrity and that they share the board's commitment to irrefutably strong governance and business practices."</p>

<p>Ellis added, "I take my role as GLAAD's financial steward incredibly seriously, and we'll continue updating our procedures to keep pace with the organization's rapid growth."<br />

       <description><![CDATA[As doctors performed emergency surgery, his heart stopped for 25 minutes and he also suffered a mini-stroke.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a harrowing medical ordeal, a British university student miraculously survived after being clinically dead for 25 minutes at a US hospital. According to the&nbsp;<em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cllyl9ed40no">BBC</a></em>,&nbsp;Charlie Vincent's inaugural day as a canoeing instructor at a summer camp in New Hampshire took a drastic turn when excessive sun exposure left him with severe second-degree burns on his legs.</p>

<p>Unaware of the severity of his burns, he continued to work, but the pain and damage soon became too much to bear, leading to a medical emergency. Camp leaders rushed him to the hospital, where doctors diagnosed not only severe sunburn but also pneumonia.&nbsp;As doctors performed emergency surgery, his heart stopped for 25 minutes&nbsp;and he also suffered a mini-stroke.</p>

<p>It took a chilling 25 minutes before the his heart restarted, his family said. Charlie's 24-year-old sister, Emily Vincent, described his operating table recovery as a "miracle". She also shared that doctors discovered he had an enlarged heart, also known as cardiomegaly, which means the heart has to work harder than normal.</p>

<p>The 20-year-old was subsequently placed in an induced coma for seven days, with doctors initially fearing the need for heart and kidney transplants.&nbsp;However, against all odds, Mr Vincent pulled through, as his&nbsp;organs began to miraculously recover.</p>

<p>''At one point, I just couldn't see a way that Charlie was going to make it, it was absolutely heart-breaking, it was hell. It's definitely a miracle that he's still here, I think the hospital he has been in has given him the most amazing care and without that, I don't think he would have made it,'' she said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Charlie is now taking his first steps towards a comeback as he has regained the strength to walk again.&nbsp;He is due to return to the UK for further treatment in the coming days on a medical flight.</p>

<p>The Vincent family have set up a GoFundMe to help cover the costs of Charlie's medical bills. It has already raised over 13,000 pounds and is set to be spent on travel costs for the parents as well as the medical bills.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The program aims to cultivate professionals to develop marriage-related industries and cultures and to promote China's positive marriage and family culture.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a bid to promote China's positive marriage and family culture, the country's Civil Affairs University recently announced a new undergraduate program focused on marriage, called "Marriage Services and Management." The program comes at a time when China is facing a decline in new births, closely tied to falling marriage rates, <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.independent.co.uk/asia/china/china-university-announces-marriage-degree-b2590158.html">Independent</a></em> reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The undergraduate program, set to open in the Beijing institution this September, seeks to ''cultivate professionals to develop marriage related industries and culture'', according to state media.&nbsp;The program, which begins enrolling students this September, will recruit 70 undergraduates across 12 provinces in 2024, vice president of the university Zhao Honggang told local media.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>About the program:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>The program aims to cultivate professionals to develop marriage-related industries and cultures and to promote China's positive marriage and family culture.</li>
	<li>The program will cover topics such as family counseling, high-end wedding planning, and the development of matchmaking products.</li>
	<li>Graduates of the program will have career opportunities in industry associations, matchmaking agencies, wedding service companies, and marriage and family counseling organizations.</li>
</ul>

<p>Notably, China's population has declined for the second consecutive year, primarily attributed to a persistent drop in birth rates. Despite the relaxation of the one-child policy in 2016, allowing couples to have up to three children since 2021, marriage rates have continued to plummet. This trend has been ongoing for nearly a decade, with 2022 marking a record low in marriages. Consequently, the birth rate has halved since 2016, reaching a critically low level in 2023.</p>

<p>China's economic slowdown appears to be a significant factor in the declining marriage rate among young people. With rising concerns about job security and financial stability, many young people are hesitant to commit to marriage. The country's slowing economy has led to reduced job prospects, lower wages, and decreased consumer confidence, making it challenging for young adults to feel financially prepared for marriage and starting a family. Additionally, the high cost of living, including housing and healthcare expenses also contribute to the delay or avoidance of marriage.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Several users on China's social media platform Weibo ridiculed the announcement with one writing "It's time to start a state owned marriage agency."</p>

<p>Others questioned the need for such a degree. "This industry is not just a sunset, it's doomsday," one wrote, while another commented that "Learning this major is really unemployment after graduation."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Renowned Indian astrologer Kushal Kumar, known as the "Indian Nostradamus", has issued a fresh warning that World War III will begin on either August 4 or August 5.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Renowned Indian astrologer Kushal Kumar, known as the "<a href="https://www.ndtv.com/offbeat/indian-astrologer-stands-by-prediction-claims-world-war-3-is-days-away-5913389 ">Indian Nostradamus</a>", has issued a fresh warning that World War III will begin on either August 4 or August 5.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mr Kumar, who previously predicted the Israel-Hamas War and the Russia-Ukraine War, claimed that a combination of geopolitical events will trigger the catastrophic conflict.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mr Kumar has made multiple predictions about the start date of World War 3, but so far, none of them have come true. Earlier, he announced that the war would begin on June 18, 2024, but that date passed without incident. He then declared a new date, predicting that World War 3 would start on either July 26 or July 28, but again, his prediction was incorrect. Now, it remains to be seen if he will finally get it right this time.</p>

<p><strong>Here are some facts about the astrologer:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Kushal Kumar is a Vedic astrology writer from Panchkula, Haryana, as per LinkedIn.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>His articles have been published in world-leading astrology magazines such as 'The Mountain Astrology' (TMA) from California and 'Horoscope' from New York.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Mr Kumar specialises in areas such as economy, weather, business, strategies, conflicts and global affairs, with an emphasis on Vedic astrology. He also provides personalised astrological guidance to individuals based on their birth time details.</li>
	<li>He has a track record of making accurate predictions, as evident from his article "Astrological probable alerts for the United States in 2018" published in Wisdom Magazine in December 2017.&nbsp;</li>

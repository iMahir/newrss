       <description><![CDATA[Why did Labour thump the Conservatives? The crumbling NHS, or National Health Service, state of the economy, and attendant concerns like price rise, were all high on the list of reasons for the defeat.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Out with the old, and in with the new (sort of), UK voters said Friday, handing <a class="sp_lnk2" href="http://www.ndtv.com/topic/rishi-sunak" target="_blank">Rishi Sunak</a>'s Conservatives a thumping defeat in the general election, stripping it of nearly 250 seats in the 650-seat House of Commons. And Sir <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/topic/keir-starmer" target="_blank">Keir Starmer</a>'s Labour has been handed the keys to the castle.</p>

<p>Mr Starmer and his 'new' Labour will now form the next government. Addressing a cheering crowd of party faithfuls at a dawn victory rally in central London, he declared <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/uk-gets-its-future-back-labours-keir-starmer-in-victory-speech-6037737" target="_blank">the UK "gets its future back"</a>.</p>

<p>The scale of the Tories defeat is singular; in power for 14 years, the party was routed in Wales and Scotland, and saw some of its biggest leaders, including ex-Prime Minister Liz Truss, beaten.</p>

<h3><strong>Labour's Landslide</strong></h3>

<p>But perhaps the most chastening blow - the BBC is reporting the Conservatives have lost seats, in the shire counties of England, they have held since the 19th or early 20th century. For example, Labour's Joe Morris beat the Tory's Guy Opperman to end the Tory's 100-year hold on the Hexham seat.</p>

<p><strong>READ |&nbsp;</strong><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/i-am-sorry-uk-pm-rishi-sunak-concedes-defeat-in-uk-polls-6037606" target="_blank">"I Am Sorry": Rishi Sunak Concedes Defeat In UK Polls</a></p>

<p>The Conservatives are set for one of their worst ever returns in a general election, and Labour, with over 400 seats, its best. Exit polls had predicted just such a scenario, giving Mr Starmer 405 seats.</p>

<h3><strong>Conservatives' Collapse</strong></h3>

<p>Rishi Sunak, the outgoing PM, called for an early election in May.</p>

<p>The warning signs were present then; indeed, they had been present for several weeks, if not months, prior, as UK voters battled a cost-of-living crisis, a growing immigration problem, and poor infrastructure and healthcare, among other issues, and the Tories a serious image problem.</p>

<p><strong>READ |&nbsp;</strong><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/uk-political-crisis-why-the-country-has-seen-3-prime-ministers-in-3-years-6008758" target="_blank">UK In Crisis: Why Country Has Seen 3 PMs In 3 Years</a></p>

<p>At that point the Conservatives - asking the British public for permission to install a sixth Prime Minister since 2010 - were already 20 points behind a rejuvenated Labour, but Mr Sunak seemed to believe he could close and overhaul the gap. Unfortunately, this did not happen.</p>

<h3><strong>Why Labour Beat Conservative?</strong></h3>

<p>Take your pick. But the crumbling NHS, or National Health Service, and the state of the economy, and attendant concerns like price rise, are high on the list of reasons for the defeat.</p>

<p>A poll by IPSOS Issues Index in June said concerns over slashing of funding for the NHS - a free public healthcare scheme that any other country would love to have - was top of the list, followed by the economy, immigration, price rise, housing and schools, defence and anti-terrorism, and crime.</p>

<p>Mr Sunak scored poorly on all these points, including overseeing the country's lowest growth rate since the early 19th century and a steep cost-of-living increase, the highest in 41 years.</p>

<p>The <strong>British economy</strong> has slowed significantly over the past decade, even accounting for the global crisis triggered by the Covid pandemic. GDP per capita grew just 4.3 per cent from 2007 to 2023.</p>

<p>In the previous 16 years that figure was a massive 46 per cent.</p>

<p>There did seem to be some relief soon; in May the International Monetary Fund spoke of a "soft landing" for the economy, and upgraded the growth forecast by 0.2 percentage points to 0.7.</p>

<p>And it was, perhaps, on the back of that expectation Mr Sunak called for the early election.</p>

<p>The <strong>NHS</strong> is seen by many to be the crown in the British government's public services.</p>

<p class="ins_instory_dv_caption">Funding for the UK's national free healthcare scheme, the NHS, has been a key issue (File).</p>
</div>

<p>The Conservatives had repeatedly stressed the importance of the NHS, but that concern seemed not to translate into on-ground support for doctors, nurses, and medical professionals.</p>

<p>Budgetary allocations under the Tories paint a clear picture. Since they came to power in 2010 healthcare spending has grown by an average of 2.8 per cent per year, compared to 3.6 per cent in the past 50. This includes the period of the pandemic.</p>

<p>In April there were an estimated 7.6 million people waiting for treatment under the NHS scheme, of which over 50,000 had been on the list for more than a year. The median wait time was 14 weeks.</p>

<p>The number of people waiting for medical aid, including those with serious conditions, has tripled under Conservative rule, according to data from the NHS published by <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/7/4/uk-general-election-2024-key-issues-by-the-numbers" target="_blank">Al Jazeera</a>.</p>

<p>Brexit had its say too, with movement restrictions meaning medical professionals from mainland Europe could either not be hired or chose not to sign up. As horrible as this sounds, this was good news for India, with the NHS turning to its former colony to fill over 2,000 doctors' posts.</p>

<p><strong>Immigration</strong> was also an issue. Mr Sunak's government had promised to crack down on illegal entrants into the UK, but its Rwanda policy - supposed to act as a major deterrent - failed to deliver.</p>

<p>In fact, two years after its announcement not one plane has taken off for the African nation.</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://news.sky.com/story/general-election-labour-and-conservative-immigration-policies-explained-13146912" target="_blank">Sky News</a>, the Conservatives have spent over 300 million pounds on this scheme, which they said would deter illegal immigrants entering the UK on small boats across the English Channel.</p>

<p>Under this policy, those caught would be sent to Rwanda while they apply for asylum.</p>

<p>As of March-end a total of 1.18 lakh people are waiting for an initial decision on their application.</p>

<p>The rising <strong>cost of living</strong> and skyrocketing <strong>house prices</strong>, as well as steep <strong>increases in rental prices</strong>, have also been a problem the Conservatives seemed not to be able to control.</p>

<h3><strong>Truss, Johnson's Contributions</strong></h3>

<p>It wasn't just Mr Sunak's failures that led to the Conservatives' downfall.</p>

<p>Boris Johnson was elected as the Tories' leader and the PM in July 2019, shortly before the pandemic struck. His dishevelled appearance and chaotic leadership precipitated a revolt by his ministers and, of course, the 'Partygate' scandal that referred to parties at 10, Downing Street during a lockdown.</p>

<p>Mr Johnson resigned in June last year following an investigation that he called a "witch hunt".</p>

<p>He was followed by Ms Truss - the UK's fourth female PM and its shortest-serving leader.</p>

<p>Ms Truss - who lost her South West Norfolk seat - faced criticism for the way it handled the economy, including a controversial mini-budget that led to market turmoil. Her leadership was further undermined by U-turns on policy and a loss of confidence among MPs.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Larry the Cat, Chief Mouser of 10 Downing Street, has shared his thoughts on the recent UK election results.&nbsp;The beloved feline posted a picture of himself standing at a miniature podium, complete with a tiny microphone as if delivering a speech. Larry's caption poked fun at the election outcome, saying, "The people have spoken and what they've said is mainly swear words aimed at the Tories."<br />
<br />
The post was a purr-fect jab at the Conservative Party's defeat in the general election.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">"The people have spoken and what they've said is mainly swear words aimed at the Tories"<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GeneralElection2024?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#GeneralElection2024</a> <a href="https://t.co/jHR2iaGKML">pic.twitter.com/jHR2iaGKML</a></p>
— Larry the Cat (@Number10cat) <a href="https://twitter.com/Number10cat/status/1809092277354086895?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 5, 2024</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>The UK's Labour Party, led by Keir Starmer, <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/uk-general-election-results-2024-live-keir-starmer-labour-party-tipped-for-historic-sweep-rishi-sunak-conservatives-6034921 ">secured a decisive victory</a> with most seats in the House of Commons and ending 14 years of Conservative rule. Rishi Sunak, the outgoing Prime Minister, conceded defeat as several cabinet members lost their seats.<br />
<br />
Larry is a brown-and-white tabby cat rescued from the Battersea Dogs and Cats Home. PM David Cameron and his wife chose him as a pet for their children.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Throughout the political turmoil of the past 14 years, Larry has remained a constant presence in Downing Street, serving under five Conservative prime ministers since 2011. The cat has since completed 13 years in the Parliament home.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Last year, <a href="http:// https://x.com/Number10cat/status/1625773929942904834?lang=en ">Larry celebrated his 12 years</a>, saying how he was appointed Chief Mouser to the Cabinet Office “12 years ago” and boasted about outlasting “four Prime Ministers and have been in charge here longer than Thatcher, Blair, Churchill and Disraeli.”<br />
<br />
With the current change in government, Larry will soon welcome his first Labour prime minister, Keir Starmer. The departure of Rishi Sunak also means Larry will bid farewell to Nova, the fox-red labrador retriever.<br />
<br />
Earlier, Rishi Sunak's wife Akshata Murty revealed the behind-the-scenes dynamics of <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/feature/larry-the-cat-or-nova-the-dog-akshata-murty-on-power-struggle-at-10-downing-street-4422196 ">Downing Street's furry residents</a>. “Nova has mixed emotions about (living here) because she sometimes doesn't get on with Larry the Cat. And they've had some heated exchanges and Larry's come out on top," she said.<br />
<br />
In November 2022, Larry voiced his displeasure <a href="https://x.com/Number10cat/status/1587323660817375232 ">on X</a> when Rishi Sunak's family moved in with Nova, saying, "ANOTHER dog?! Bring back Liz Truss..."<br />
<br />
This wasn't the first time Larry had had a problem with canine companions in Downing Street. In 2019, when Boris Johnson's Jack Russell Cross, Dilyn, joined the household, Larry <a href="https://x.com/Number10cat/status/1168478009692708864 ">tweeted</a>, "Confirmation that Downing Street is going to the dogs...."&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[According to The Verge, the feature discovered in the WhatsApp Beta for Android version 2.24.14.7 harnesses a combination of user-provided images, text prompts, and Meta's AI Llama model to generate these custom avatars.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WhatsApp is in the process of developing a new feature that will enable users to create personalised AI avatars of themselves, capable of being placed in various virtual settings.</p>

<p>According to The Verge, the feature discovered in the WhatsApp Beta for Android version 2.24.14.7 harnesses a combination of user-provided images, text prompts, and Meta's AI Llama model to generate these custom avatars.</p>

<p>According to the screenshots captured by The Verge, users will have the ability to envision themselves "in any setting, from the forest to outer space."</p>

<p>The generated images are reportedly reminiscent of those produced by popular AI generators like Lensa AI or Snapchat's "Dreams" selfie feature.</p>

<p>To generate these personalised avatars, WhatsApp users will initially need to submit photographs of themselves, which will serve as reference images for Meta AI.</p>

<p>Subsequently, users can create their avatars by typing commands such as "Imagine me" followed by a description of the desired setting in Meta AI chat or by using "@Meta AI imagine me..." in other WhatsApp conversations.</p>

<p>This feature is expected to be optional and will require users to manually enable it in WhatsApp settings.</p>

<p>Furthermore, users will have the flexibility to delete the reference images stored in Meta AI settings at any time, ensuring privacy and control over personal data.</p>

<p>Despite its innovative potential, there is no specific timeline for the general availability of this new AI avatar feature. WhatsApp continues to roll out support for its Meta AI chatbot and real-time AI image generation capabilities, particularly in the United States.</p>

<p>Therefore, the launch of the AI avatar feature may be subject to gradual deployment as WhatsApp and Meta navigate the complexities associated with generative AI tools, according to The Verge.</p>

<p>Given previous challenges with generative AI technologies, Meta appears to be adopting a cautious approach to ensure the functionality and security of this upcoming feature.</p>

<p>As development progresses, WhatsApp users can anticipate a new dimension of personalisation and creativity in their messaging experience, facilitated by advanced AI capabilities.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Elections in both the United Kingdom and France reflected voter discontent. While France has seen a rise in the far-right National Rally (RN) party, the UK has witnessed a resurgence by the Labour Party.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the recent elections in France, a surprise dissolution of parliament triggered by President Emmanuel Macron saw a dramatic rise of the far-right National Rally (RN) party, while in the United Kingdom, the Labour Party won by an unprecedented margin and ended 14 years of Conservative rule. Both elections revealed voter discontent in the two countries.</p>

<h3><strong>The Rise Of The Far-Right In France</strong></h3>

<p>On June 30, the first leg of the French elections took place. An attempt to halt the momentum of the resurgent RN, however, saw Mr Macron's decision to dissolve parliament spectacularly backfire. RN, led by Marine Le Pen won the highest vote share, polling 33 per cent, the left-wing New Popular Front (NFP) garnering 28 per cent and Mr Macron's centrist bloc could manage only 20.7 per cent in votes tally. This result set the stage for the second round of polling to be held on July 7.</p>

<p>Mr Macron's suspension of parliament was meant to solidify a clear majority for his administration after getting heavily beaten during the European Parliament parliament. However, it was meant to unify opposition against the RN, but it seems it has emboldened the far-right instead. The polls correctly predicted that the RN would lead, and Macron's approval ratings collapsed to 36 per cent, as indicated by polls.</p>

<h3><strong>The Revival Of Labour In UK</strong></h3>

<p>Across the Channel, the UK saw its own political earthquake. On Friday, Keir Starmer's Labour Party surmounted the odds and registered a historic win, ending Rishi Sunak's Conservative Party's 14-year rule. The election results reflect widespread dissatisfaction with the Tory government, particularly in the wake of Liz Truss's short-lived and disastrous tenure and Mr Sunak's leadership in its aftermath.</p>

<p>Ms Truss's brief premiership of only 49 days, which was marked by unfunded tax cuts upsetting the markets damaged the reputation of the Conservative Party. Mr Sunak's attempts to steady the ship were insufficient to regain public trust.</p>

<p>Mr Starmer's leadership has been pivotal in Labour's revival. Since taking up the role in early 2020, he has repositioned the party to the centre, and fixed problems within the party that include in-fighting and anti-Semitism. Opinion polls consistently showed Labour significantly ahead of the Tories, which reflected the public mood that was in favour of change.</p>

<h3><strong>Mainstreaming The Far-Right</strong></h3>

<p>RN's rise cannot be attributed solely to the mistakes of Mr Macron. Ms Le Pen's deliberate efforts to soften the party's image have been instrumental. Since inheriting leadership from her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, in 2011, she has worked to shed the party's extreme-right reputation. The 2018 rebranding from the National Front to the National Rally marked a significant step in this transformation. In a decisive move to break from the past, Ms Le Pen expelled her father from the party in 2015 following his repetition of a contentious Holocaust remark.</p>

<p>Still, the party did not shake off its xenophobic rhetoric. Jordan Bardella, the party's would-be prime minister, has vowed to bar dual nationals from several state jobs.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Reflections For Conservative Party</strong></h3>

<p>The electoral result, the worst for the Tories since 1906, brought home deep differences among the party ranks. party leaders such as Suella Braverman and Penny Mordaunt have criticised the failure of the party to connect with voters.</p>

<p>"I want to briefly address the results around the country, and there's only one thing I can say... sorry. I'm sorry. The Great British people voted for us over 14 years and we did not keep our promises... we acted like we were entitled to your votes," Ms Braverman said as quoted by the BBC. "I'm sorry my party didn't listen to you."</p>

<p>There is also uncertainty in which direction the Tories will take in the future, with calls for a more coherent policy to gain back the trust of the voters.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chinese tech companies, from industry giants to ambitious startups, converged at the World AI Conference in Shanghai this week to showcase their latest innovations and express strong support for the country's artificial intelligence sector even as it faces U.S. sanctions.</p>

<p>More than 150 AI-related products and solutions are being exhibited at the conference, with a small number of foreign firms such as Tesla and Qualcomm joining the predominantly Chinese line-up, according to the event organizer.</p>

<p>The conference has also served as a launchpad for some companies to introduce their latest AI products.</p>

<p>One notable example is SenseTime, which previously focused on facial recognition technology but recently shifted its attention to generative AI following the release of ChatGPT by OpenAI in late 2022.</p>

<p>On Friday, the company unveiled its SenseNova 5.5, its most advanced large language model (LLM), which is being touted as a rival to OpenAI's GPT-4o in areas such as mathematical reasoning.</p>

<p>Despite challenges posed by U.S. sanctions that limit access to advanced chips, many executives at the conference expressed confidence that Chinese companies will continue to thrive in the AI sector.</p>

<p>Zhang Ping'an, the executive in charge of Huawei's cloud computing unit, told a forum that the idea that a shortage of the most advanced artificial intelligence chips will hinder China's aim to be a leader in AI needs to be "abandoned".</p>

<p>"Nobody will deny that we are facing limited computing power in China," Zhang said. "If we believe that not having the most advanced AI chips means we will be unable to lead in AI, then we need to abandon this viewpoint."</p>

<p>To address the lack of access to cutting-edge chips, Zhang called for more innovation in areas such as cloud computing.</p>

<p>This was echoed by Liu Qingfeng, chairman of AI company Iflytek, which, like Huawei, has been placed on a sanctions list that bars it from purchasing advanced chips from U.S. companies.</p>

<p>On the WeChat account of state-owned China News Service, Liu said in an interview many of the LLMs developed by Chinese companies, including Iflytek's, have been able to rival OpenAI's GPT-4.</p>

<p>"We must have our own LLMs that are independently developed and controlled by China, capable of benchmarking against the highest global standards and continuously narrowing the gap," he said.</p>

<p>Some executives, including the CEO of Chinese search engine giant Baidu, Robin Li, have urged the AI industry to shift its focus away from the development of LLMs, which require massive amounts of computing power and AI chips, and instead prioritize the adoption of AI.</p>

<p>"Without applications, having only foundational models, whether open-source or closed-source, is worthless," Li said at the conference.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The job of a PM has never been astronomically well-paid compared with other professions of similar responsibility.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The elections in the UK saw Labour registering a landslide victory and ending the Tories' 14-year grip on power. Keir Starmer will replace Rishi Sunak as the Prime Minister after Labour won 410 of the 650 seats in the House of Commons, the most since Tony Blair's 1997 landslide. The election will reshape the political landscape in the UK, with task cut out for the incoming Prime Minister. But how much will Mr Starmer be paid for the epic job?</p>

<p>According to UK Parliament, the Prime Minister is entitled to an annual salary of 172,153 pounds. His earnings are made up of 80,807 pounds for the role of Prime Minister, and an additional 91,346 pounds (<a href="https://www.parliament.uk/about/mps-and-lords/members/pay-mps/">revised on April 1, 2024</a>) for being an MP.</p>

<p>However, out of the total amount, 75,440 pounds is actually claimed. As per the House of Commons website, MPs pay the same tax and national insurance as any other employed person across the country.</p>

<p>The job of a PM has never been astronomically well-paid compared with other professions of similar responsibility. According to an old by <em>BBC News</em> report, previous prime ministers have previously found themselves drowning in debt and requiring a bail-out from the monarchy.</p>

<p>A report in <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/uk-prime-minister-salary-rishi-sunak-b2342294.html"><em>The Independent</em></a> said that there has been a significant fall in the standard of living for UK Prime Ministers over the centuries. In the 18th century, William Pitt received 10,500 pounds per annum as first lord of the Treasury. The Marquess of Salisbury, incumbent PM at the turn of the 20th century, was on 5,000 pounds per annum - or a half a million pounds according today's exchange rates.</p>

<p>By 1937, the prime minister's annual pay was the equivalent of a modern 600,000 pounds.</p>

<p>The Public Duty Costs Allowance (PDCA), which was established following the resignation of Margaret Thatcher, allows former Prime Ministers to claim up to 115,000 pounds annually for the "necessary office costs and secretarial costs arising from their special position in public life". These costs can be claimed for life.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Europe's stock markets rose in opening deals on Friday as investors digested news that Labour, as expected, clinched a landslide election victory in Britain to end 14 years of Conservative rule.</p>

<p>London's benchmark FTSE 100 index rose 0.4 percent following news that Keir Starmer will become Britain's new prime minister as his centre-left opposition Labour party sweeps to power.</p>

<p>Elsewhere, the Paris CAC 40 stocks index added 0.3 percent and Frankfurt's DAX was up 0.6 percent with eurozone investors on tenterhooks before France's crucial legislative vote this weekend.</p>

<p>"In the UK, the expected Labour landslide was effectively much ado about nothing in terms of market movement," noted Richard Hunter, head of markets at trading group Interactive Investor.</p>

<p>In France, tactical voting efforts to block the far-right from taking over the government have partly bolstered European markets.</p>

<p>But analysts remain wary that the second-biggest economy in the European Union could be headed for a period of political deadlock if there is no overall winner on Sunday.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On the eve of polls opening in the UK general election, Keir Starmer allowed himself a moment to reflect on how far he had come since he became leader of the Labour Party four-and-a-half years ago. Back then, the party was reeling from one of the worst defeats in its 100-year history.</p>

<p>"The optimists said it will take 10 years to fix this party and get it back," he told reporters ahead of a final rally in the East Midlands. "The pessimists said you're never going to fix this party, it's never going to be in government again." adding "Here we are."</p>

<p>He has now led the Labour Party to victory, on track for the biggest majority in Parliament since at least Tony Blair's New Labour landslide in 1997.</p>

<p>The UK's presumptive prime minister has far outperformed the expectations of his chances when he took over from the hard-left Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn in 2020. Bland, boring, "no Tony Blair," as focus groups often describe him, this relative newcomer to the world of politics has, in part, been a beneficiary of circumstances.</p>

<p>Boris Johnson's "partygate" scandal and Liz Truss's "mini-budget" - which tanked the pound - came at the tail-end of years of Conservative austerity that left deep cuts to many public services. All have contributed to the result we have now seen in the British general election. But Starmer has had his part to play too, demonstrating a quiet ruthlessness in changing his party, purging the Corbynites, even expelling Corbyn himself, and bringing it into a position to win and govern again.</p>

<p>"It feels good, I have to be honest," Starmer told Labour supporters in London after the party crossed the crucial 326-seat threshold in the House of Commons, adding that he knew "a mandate like this comes with a great responsibility."</p>

<p>He'll now have to show whether those same skills that got him into 10 Downing St. will help him resolve a staggering list of challenges. Britons are bruised by the impact of Brexit, the pandemic and a historic squeeze on living standards. His government faces a more dangerous world and has little money to spend on improving the situation at home without raising broad-based taxes, something he's said he doesn't want to do.</p>

<p>Despite being known as "Sir Keir" - he was knighted for his legal career before entering politics - the UK's new prime minister had humble beginnings, something he has been at pains to remind voters throughout the election campaign. He grew up, as he often recounts, in a "pebble-dashed" semi-detached house in Oxted, a London commuter town in the Surrey countryside. He was one of four children to a toolmaker father and a mother with a debilitating autoimmune condition, which meant she had to give up her work as a nurse while Starmer was a child.</p>

<p>Starmer's father raised his four children and looked after his sick wife on his own, and money was often tight. "I remember when our phone was cut off because we couldn't pay the bill," Starmer has recalled during the campaign. "How hard it was to make ends meet."</p>

<p>The young Starmer was given a leg-up in life by attending Reigate Grammar, a state school, where he secured the grades to become the first in his family to attend university. He studied law at Leeds, graduating with honors, and got accepted to Oxford University to do a BCL - a prestigious year-long graduate law course. As a young man in London in the late 1980s, he lived in a "party flat" where there was sometimes vomit in the bathtub, hosting friends into the early hours and writing radical treatises for niche left-leaning publications. But by day he was climbing the ranks to become a respected human rights lawyer.</p>

<p>Starmer, who has denied being the inspiration for the dashing human rights lawyer Mark Darcy in the book and film Bridget Jones' Diary, became known for his pro bono work, including defending individuals in the Caribbean against the death penalty. He had a brush with national fame for defending two activists, Helen Steel and David Morris, a gardener and a former postman, who sued for libel by McDonald's for distributing leaflets criticizing the fast food chain, in what became known as the 'McLibel' case. He was appointed Queen's Counsel in 2002, a few months before his 40th birthday.</p>

<p>Keir Starmer as Director of Public Prosecutions, in 2010.</p>

<p>The following year, Starmer took on a role that would rewrite his theory of change: human rights adviser to the Policing Board in Northern Ireland. His job was to ensure that the new police service, formed after the 1998 peace agreement, commanded the trust of all communities. Before this role, Starmer had seen himself as railing against the system from the outside. This was his first experience of going inside an organization to deliver change. He found this new way was far more effective.</p>

<p>He took on a major role leading after that, becoming director of public prosecutions from 2008 to 2013. The role put him in charge of delivering criminal justice in the UK, running a large organization of thousands of staff and lawyers during a period of major budget cuts. He led the organization when it successfully prosecuted senior media figures for phone hacking and politicians for fiddling with their expenses.</p>

<p>No one was surprised when the country's former top prosecutor entered the world of politics. After his time as DPP ended, Starmer stood for election in the safe Labour seat of Holborn and St. Pancras in the May 2015 general election, expecting to be attorney general in Ed Miliband's Cabinet. Instead, he went straight to the opposition benches and joined a Labour parliamentary party tearing itself apart after a shock defeat.</p>

<p>During the Jeremy Corbyn years Starmer, a remainer, rose through the shadow ministerial ranks to become shadow Brexit secretary. While colleagues like Rachel Reeves refused to serve under Corbyn or resigned from the party altogether over antisemitism, Starmer stayed. But by March 2018, Starmer and his allies - frustrated by the antisemitism problem and by Corbyn's foreign policy stances - knew he would stand for party leader when the time came. For nearly two years, they held secret meetings every Monday morning to make sure he was ready for a leadership campaign when the time arose.</p>

<p>The time came in 2020. Starmer ran and won, a leadership campaign centered on 10 pledges to Labour members, essentially to retain the radical spirit of the Corbynite agenda with promises such as renationalizing, rail, mail, energy, and water. He memorably paid tribute to "my friend Jeremy Corbyn."</p>

<p>Since taking over the leadership, Starmer has expelled Corbyn from the party, introduced mandatory antisemitism training, and vigorously vetted, and sometimes imposed, candidates who will be loyal to his leadership. Encouraged by his shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves and other close aides from the party's right-wing, he has instilled a tight fiscal discipline, ditched almost all of his original leadership pledges, and draped his party in the union flag and embraced the language of security, discipline, and patriotism.</p>

<p>It has not all been plain sailing. He lost the Hartlepool by-election - seeing a safe Labour seat fall to Johnson's Conservatives - early into his leadership in 2020, after which he considered resigning. The experience saw him fire some advisers, appoint new people, and hardened his determination to overhaul his party.</p>

<p>More recently, Starmer suffered a protracted and public disagreement among his top team over whether to ditch his party's pledge to spend £28 billion ($36 billion) per year on green infrastructure, culminating in a major reversal. He has faced criticism and lost votes over an LBC radio interview in October in which he said Israel "has the right" to withhold power and water from Gaza, which he later apologized for.</p>

<p>The team of advisers around him has been referred to as a "boys' club," accused of heavy-handedness in their purging of the Corbynite wing of the party and in their wider attitude to the party's elected representatives.</p>

<p>While his dissenters balk at how different he is from the man who stood for leader four and a half years ago, Starmer is proud of that difference. "I changed my party," he says. "Now I want to change the country."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Britain's Labour Party won a parliamentary election on Friday, bringing to an end 14 years of Conservative Party-led government that saw the country weather one of the more turbulent periods in its post-World War Two political history.</p>

<p>Here are some of the defining moments of the Conservatives' four terms in power - under five prime ministers - since 2010:</p>

<h3><strong>2010 ELECTION RESULTS IN HUNG PARLIAMENT</strong></h3>

<p>The Conservative Party led by David Cameron wins the most seats in parliament but not an overall majority, ousting the Labour Party which had been in power since 1997. Britain has its first coalition government since 1945, after Cameron agrees to work with the centrist Liberal Democrats.</p>

<h3><strong>2014 SCOTTISH REFERENDUM</strong></h3>

<p>In a referendum that had threatened to split the United Kingdom, Scotland votes 55%-45% against independence in a victory for Cameron and the main national political parties over the Scottish National Party.</p>

<h3><strong>2015 SURPRISE CONSERVATIVE ELECTION VICTORY</strong></h3>

<p>With polls pointing to a close election, Cameron wins an unexpected majority and a second term as prime minister. He follows through on a 2013 pledge to hold a referendum on leaving the European Union. Cameron wants Britain to remain in the EU.</p>

<h3><strong>2016: UK VOTES FOR BREXIT, CAMERON QUITS</strong></h3>

<p>Britons cause a global shock by voting 52%-48% to leave the EU, ending a more than 40-year union and plunging the country into its biggest political crisis since World War Two. Cameron resigns and the party chooses Theresa May to succeed him.</p>

<h3><strong>2017 SNAP ELECTION GAMBLE BACKFIRES</strong></h3>

<p>Riding high in opinion polls and seeking a bigger majority in parliament to push Brexit legislation through, May calls a snap election. The Conservatives lose their majority and form a government by striking a deal with Northern Ireland's pro-UK Democratic Unionist Party.</p>

<h3><strong>MAY 2019: BREXIT PARALYSIS, MAY RESIGNS, JOHNSON TAKES OVER</strong></h3>

<p>May quits after failing to break a parliamentary deadlock over how Britain should leave the EU. Boris Johnson - one of the main faces of the pro-Brexit campaign - wins the internal Conservative Party contest to succeed her.</p>

<h3><strong>DEC 2019: JOHNSON LEADS CONSERVATIVES TO SWEEPING WIN</strong></h3>

<p>With parliament paralysed over Brexit, Johnson calls a snap election. Campaigning under the slogan "Get Brexit Done" he steers the Conservatives to their biggest election win since Margaret Thatcher's landslide victory in 1987.</p>

<h3><strong>2020 BREXIT GETS DONE</strong></h3>

<p>Johnson used his mandate to drive a Brexit deal through parliament and Brussels, and Britain exited the EU on Jan. 31, 2020, becoming the first state to withdraw from the bloc.</p>

<h3><strong>JULY 2022: JOHNSON OUSTED</strong></h3>

<p>Johnson leads Britain during the COVID-19 pandemic - at one point being hospitalised himself with the disease - but a long list of scandals and missteps prove too much and he steps down after a ministerial revolt.</p>

<h3><strong>SEPT 2022: TRUSS' CHAOTIC PREMIERSHIP</strong></h3>

<p>Liz Truss beats Rishi Sunak in a contest to succeed Johnson. Her "mini-budget" containing unfunded tax cuts spooks financial markets, pushing up borrowing costs sharply and further tarnishing Britain's reputation for political and fiscal stability. She lasts only 44 days before announcing her resignation.</p>

<h3><strong>OCT 2022: SUNAK BECOMES PRIME MINISTER</strong></h3>

<p>Sunak takes over as Britain's third prime minister in as many months, pledging to restore stability to government. He makes five key pledges focused on the economy, stopping illegal immigration and improving the health system. In February 2023, Sunak struck a deal with the EU on trade rules for Northern Ireland, improving ties with the bloc.</p>

<h3><strong>MAY 2024 - SUNAK CALLS ELECTION</strong></h3>

<p>Trailing the Labour Party by around 20 points in the polls, Sunak calls an election for July 4. Labour, led by Keir Starmer, wins the election.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) made its debut in the 2024 UK general election as an independent candidate. <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/meet-ai-steve-first-ai-candidate-contesting-in-uk-elections-5923288 ">AI Steve</a>, the brainchild of businessman Steve Endacott, contested the Brighton Pavilion constituency. However, despite the innovative approach, AI Steve failed to impress voters, securing only <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/election/2024/uk/constituencies/E14001130 ">179 votes</a> (0.3% of the total).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mr Endacott, frustrated with the country's "standard politics," launched AI Steve as a unique solution. The AI avatar, powered by Neural Voice company, aimed to provide round-the-clock access to constituents.&nbsp;</p>

<p>AI Steve was designed to engage with voters in real time on various issues and offer policy ideas. It could handle up to 10,000 conversations simultaneously.</p>

<p>Earlier, the UK election watchdog issued a clarification on AI Steve's candidature. If AI Steve won the seat, the human candidate, Steve Endacott, and not the AI entity, would take office as a member of Parliament, the poll body said.</p>

<p>Although AI Steve made history as the first such candidate in UK polls, its campaign struggled to gain momentum. The Brighton Pavilion constituency saw a turnout of 70%, with the Green Party's Sian Berry winning the seat.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Keir Starmer's Labour Party emerged victorious in the UK general election, securing a majority government with over 326 seats in the House of Commons. This decisive win marks the end of 14 years of Conservative rule, with Mr Starmer set to become the next Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>Rishi Sunak, the incumbent Prime Minister, has conceded defeat after multiple cabinet members lost their seats.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>As was widely expected in the UK elections, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/uk-gets-its-future-back-labours-keir-starmer-in-victory-speech-6037737">the Labour Party has registered</a> one of its biggest victories, inflicting a huge defeat on the Conservative Party.</p>

<p>No one had expected this seismic outcome just a few years ago. But Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, who is going to be the next British Prime Minister, is being hailed by everyone for changing the fortune of the party. He promised to get Britain out of economic stagnation and claimed he would fix the ailing National Health Services. He even reached out to ethnic communities, including the Indian diaspora.</p>

<h2><strong>'Namaste', Starmer</strong></h2>

<p>In the last days of the election campaign, Keir Starmer visited the Shree Swaminarayan Mandir Kingsbury, a prominent Hindu temple in London, and said "namaste" with folded hands. His charm offensive included him wearing a <em>tilak </em>on his forehead and a floral garland around his neck. Starmer may have looked out of place, but it was an attempt to placate angry Indian diaspora voters, the majority of whom were expected to favour the Conservative Party. The temple visit was also intended to send out a strong signal of friendship with India.</p>

<p><strong><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/uk-election-results-live-rishi-sunak-braces-for-huge-loss-as-early-results-herald-labour-keir-starmer-win-6037190">Also Read |&nbsp;Labour Sweeps UK Polls, Rishi Sunak's Party Ousted For 1st Time In 14 Years</a></strong></p>

<p>Despite his awkwardness, Starmer knew he had to perform this political act, not only because his visit underscored Labour's commitment to embracing and celebrating diversity within the UK, but also because he needed to repair relations with the influential Indian diaspora, and, by extension, India. It had been clear for quite some time that his party was returning to power after a hiatus of 14 years and he was going to be the next UK Prime Minister; that is why he needed to undertake an India outreach before assuming office.</p>

<h2><strong>The Baggage Of The Past</strong></h2>

<p>Starmer's gesture of visiting the temple was particularly significant given the events of September 2019, when during its annual conference in Brighton, the Labour Party under Jeremy Corbyn's leadership had passed a motion addressing the situation in Jammu and Kashmir. The motion declared that there was a humanitarian crisis in the region and asserted that the people of Kashmir should be granted the right to self-determination. Additionally, it had called for the deployment of international monitors to the area to ensure the protection of human rights and the assessment of the situation on the ground.</p>

<p>Needless to say, the Labour Party had gone too far. And despite the clarification issued by Jeremy Corbyn, the damage was done.</p>

<p>The motion was met with significant backlash from the Indian diaspora, who felt that it was one-sided and did not consider the complexities of the Kashmir issue. The event marked a turning point as many members of the Indian community began to shift their allegiances to the Conservative Party.</p>

<p><strong><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/this-is-a-massacre-conservative-leader-as-labour-heads-for-massive-uk-win-6037516">Also Read |&nbsp;"This Is A Massacre": Conservative Leader As Labour Heads For Massive UK Win</a></strong></p>

<p>The Indian government also responded sharply to the Labour's motion. It was reported that the Indian High Commission in London took the unprecedented step of cancelling a scheduled dinner for Labour leaders, signalling its strong disapproval. The Indian government officially rejected the motion, emphasising its concerns about what it viewed as interference in its internal affairs.</p>

<p>In an effort to mend relations, Starmer attempted to address the situation last year, when he asserted that the Labour Party would strive to maintain strong relations with India, indicating a desire to rebuild trust and cooperation. Despite these efforts, the episode highlighted the fragile nature of Labour's relations with India and underscored the significant political influence of the Indian diaspora in the UK.<br />
Labour's image makeover under Starmer</p>

<h2><strong>A Changed Labour</strong></h2>

<p>Indeed, the Labour Party has now made a triumphant comeback, securing a thumping majority. We should keep in mind that the party is a much-changed one under Starmer. It wants to inject more depth and substance into Britain's strategic partnership with India.</p>

<p>India is most likely to carefully monitor Labour's policy stance on Kashmir, immigration and the proposed Free Trade Agreement (FTA). The Indian government may have apprehensions about Labour's views on its internal matters, but on balance, the India-UK bilateral relations will not change much under Starmer. In fact, Labour supporters in the Indian community believe that under him, the relations are likely to improve. It is being claimed that the number of Indian-origin Labour MPs would double from the current six members in the outgoing Parliament.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Will The Ties Improve?</strong></h2>

<p>Academics in the UK at times tend to romanticise the bilateral ties between the two countries, looking at it chiefly from the prism of colonial nostalgia. We are led to believe that it is in India's interest to have a deeper strategic partnership with Britain. To be honest, however, India sees Britain as a middle power, whose influence on the global stage has been on the wane for long. One can only blame the Conservative Party for it, a beleaguered and divided house which presided over 14 years of stagnation. India under Narendra Modi, who was born after the country's independence, is, whether rightly or wrongly, not in awe of its erstwhile colonial masters.</p>

<p><strong><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/uks-labour-party-commits-to-stamping-out-anti-india-sentiments-5997729">Also Read |&nbsp;UK's Labour Party Commits To Stamping Out "Anti-India Sentiments"</a></strong></p>

<p>Yes, the bilateral trade in goods and services is growing steadily, and stood at&nbsp;£39 billion last year, with the balance of trade heavily in India's favour. Yes, we have a vocal, upwardly mobile Indian diaspora, which acts as a bridge between the two countries and it often works to India's advantage. But the oomph factor in bilateral relations has been missing for a long time. For example, India and the US warmed up to each other and became trusted partners only after the Civil Nuclear Agreement between the two countries was brokered under President George W. Bush. It was a pivotal moment that added significant "oomph" to bilateral ties and transformed the dynamics of the relationship, fostering deeper strategic, economic, and technological cooperation. It set the stage for an enduring partnership in the 21st century. Even during the Obama and Trump administrations the bilateral ties never ran out of excitement.&nbsp;</p>

<p>One cannot say the same about India-UK relations, which badly need to be injected with energy, excitement and a mega-deal.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>FTA: Starmer's First Challenge In India-UK Ties</strong></h2>

<p>With regards to India, one of the first tasks on Starmer's desk will be to reach a Free Trade Agreement. He has maintained his commitment to completing the FTA, but it is not going to be easy. India's priority appears to be to finalise an agreement with the European Union (EU) first. The bilateral trade in goods and services last year stood at €113&nbsp;billion. The two sides relaunched the negotiations in 2022 and the progress is said to be satisfactory.</p>

<p>According to a group of researchers, another stumbling block in the India-UK FTA is "the opposition in the UK to Indian demands for more visas for intra-company transfers and particularly to demands that social security contributions from Indian workers during such transfers be reimbursed".</p>

<h2><strong>Immigration Policies</strong></h2>

<p>Brexit has led to record levels of Indian immigration. Of the 6.85 lakh immigrants in the UK today, the majority come from India. The Labour Party's stated aim is to reduce legal immigration and curb illegal immigration. Many of the legal Indian immigrants are IT professionals on work permits, contributing to the UK's technology sector. There is a small number of illegal immigrants from India as well.</p>

<p>The party's policy seeks to balance the economic benefits of skilled migrants with the goal of controlling overall immigration numbers, reflecting broader political and economic priorities.<br />
Human Rights and Citizenship Laws</p>

<p>Historically, the Labour Party has been vocal about human rights issues in India, particularly on laws like the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC). The Labour Party's criticism has been viewed by the Indian government as interference and a misrepresentation of India's internal policies aimed at addressing specific security concerns. Starmer will be under pressure from domestic human rights organisations to put forward liberal British perspectives. His diplomatic skills are bound to be tested in the coming months and years.</p>

<p>The relations between the UK's Labour Party and the Indian government are complex, influenced by historical ties, diaspora politics, and divergent policy priorities. Addressing such challenges will require nuanced diplomacy, mutual respect, and an understanding of the sensitivities involved on both sides.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A man seated next to an Indian-origin woman, who suddenly collapsed and died moments before her flight from Melbourne to New Delhi took off, said he is "haunted" by the incident. The incident happened on June 20 when 24-year-old <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/indian-origin-woman-24-dies-on-qantas-flight-from-melbourne-to-new-delhi-6009454">Manpreet Kaur</a> boarded a Qantas flight to fly to Delhi. She suffered a medical episode while putting her seatbelt on and died on the spot. Ravinder Arora was sitting next to her and noticed Ms Kaur when he was taking his seat.</p>

<p>"When I boarded the plane, she was already seated in the aisle. I was in the window, so I asked if she could please get up so I could occupy my seat," <a href="https://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-updates/incidents/passenger-speaks-after-woman-dies-next-to-him-on-qantas-flight/news-story/24e8396d8eb3a1d35aea4a4291b847ba">he told <em>NewsAU</em></a>.</p>

<p>"I noticed that she began scrolling through photos on her mobile phone and stopped at a photograph of an elderly couple," said Mr Singh. "I asked if they were her parents. She smiled and nodded and kept staring at it."</p>

<p>Ms Kaur was going to India for the first time in four years.</p>

<p>As the plane began moving on the runway, Mr Singh said the woman leaned forward resting her head on the seat in front of her. But a jerk in the plane caused Ms Kaur's head to move towards Mr Singh. He realised something was wrong and and alerted the crew.</p>

<p>The flight attendants did everything to revive her but all the efforts were unsuccessful.</p>

<p>Mr Singh said he remains haunted by the incident.</p>

<p>"The incident has been etched in my memory for life. It is very difficult to digest that a young girl with whom you were just interacting with has passed away in front of your eyes," he told the outlet.</p>

<p>"Her innocent face stills haunts me and I want her parents to know she loved them a lot. She left this world peacefully looking at their photograph. My heart breaks for her family who would have been looking forward to seeing her after a long time," Mr Singh added.</p>

<p>Ms Kaur was studying in Melbourne and wanted to become a chef. Her body cannot leave Australia because she died from tuberculosis, forcing her parents to apply for visas so they can fly to the country and attend their daughter's funeral.</p>

<p>Her family said Ms Kaur's health had been rapidly deteriorating over recent month and she had "difficulty talking" and "no energy to do anything", <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2024/07/05/womans-heartbreaking-last-words-dying-flight-21165451/">as per <em>Metro</em></a>.</p>

<p>Authorities in Australia started the contact tracing the following day, and anyone identified as a potential risk is being notified.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Scotland's pro-separatist Scottish National Party was virtually wiped out at the UK general election on Friday, suffering a devastating blow to its withering independence movement.</p>

<p>Keir Starmer's Labour Party overturned more than a decade of SNP domination by winning a majority of Scottish seats as it rode to power in Westminster.</p>

<p>The SNP lost dozens of lawmakers as it headed for its worst result in a British general election since 2010, with senior MP Stephen Flynn, who held his seat, lamenting a "black night" for his party.</p>

<p>Labour sealed its comeback in its former heartland when it passed the 29-seat threshold to become the largest party in the country shortly after 5:30 am (0430 GMT).</p>

<p>A BBC exit poll predicted that the SNP would win only eight constituencies in Scotland, down from the 48 it won at the last election in 2019, when Labour returned just one Scottish MP.</p>

<p>The crushing loss means the SNP will lose its position as Britain's third-biggest party, which brings a high-profile slot during the weekly Prime Minister's Questions session in parliament.</p>

<p>It will also lose out on public funding and key positions on parliamentary select committees.</p>

<p>"There will have to be a lot of soul-searching as a party as a consequence of these results that have come in tonight," SNP leader John Swinney admitted to the BBC.</p>

<p>Ex-SNP leader and former Scottish leader Nicola Sturgeon said the prediction was "at the grimmer end of the expectations" for her party, which had been tipped to endure a chastening performance.</p>

<p>"This is seismic for Labour. There's no getting away from that, it's a massive achievement for Keir Starmer," she said, as Labour was tipped to win 410 seats and secure a majority of 170 in Britain as a whole.</p>

<h3><strong>Finance scandal&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>The SNP has dominated in Scotland in the last three UK elections, peaking with the 2015 vote when it won 56 seats out of 59 seats. In 2010, it got only six seats.</p>

<p>But the party has been under pressure from the resurgence of Labour in its former fiefdom north of the English border, as it rides a wave of displeasure against the Tories nationwide.</p>

<p>The SNP was overtaken by the centrist Liberal Democrats in party size and fighting to stop Nigel Farage's right-wing upstarts Reform UK from pushing it down to fifth position at Westminster.</p>

<p>The SNP has been in turmoil for months as voters tire of its 17 years in charge of the devolved Scottish parliament in Edinburgh.</p>

<p>Critics have also accused it of focusing on independence at the expense of key issues such as the cost-of-living crisis, education and health.</p>

<p>Support for the SNP has also slumped amid a finances scandal that saw Sturgeon's husband, Peter Murrell, charged with embezzlement. Murrell is the party's former chief executive.</p>

<p>Sturgeon herself was arrested, but released without charge.</p>

<p>Swinney only took charge in May following the resignation of Humza Yousaf after the collapse of the SNP's power-sharing deal with the Scottish Greens in Edinburgh.</p>

<p>Yousaf was in power for just over a year.</p>

<p>Swinney had pledged to push for fresh talks on another independence referendum if the SNP had won a majority of seats in Thursday's vote.</p>

<p>Labour and the Conservatives insist the issue was dealt with at the 2014 referendum when 55 percent of voters in Scotland opted to remain part of the UK.</p>

<p>Despite the SNP's slump, the number of Scots favouring independence has held at around 40 percent, according to surveys, providing the SNP with some solace.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As more European countries move towards a shorter, 4-day working week, workers in Greece will have to work for six days every week in a new government initiative aimed at boosting productivity and employment across the nation.</p>

<p>From July 1, employees of private companies that provide round-the-clock services will have to work 48 hours a week instead of the traditional 40 hours. The rule would not apply to food service and tourism workers.</p>

<p>Workers will have the option of working an additional two hours per day or an extra eight-hour shift every week and be rewarded with a 40% rise in their daily wage.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis has claimed that the measure, a part of a broader set of labour law reforms last year, is “worker-friendly” and “deeply growth-orientated.” “It brings Greece in line with the rest of Europe," he said.</p>

<p>The government has claimed that a longer work week will ensure employees are sufficiently compensated for overtime work and crack down on the problem of undeclared labour.</p>

<p>PM Mitsotakis has also touted the initiative as a solution for Greece's shrinking population and shortage of skilled workers. Since 2009, over 500,000 young educated citizens have moved out of the country amid a decade-long debt crisis.</p>

<p>However, the move has been heavily criticised by labour unions and political observers, with some calling it "barbaric". Unions have argued that the new law will help employers not hire additional staff.</p>

<p>EU's statistics agency, Eurostat, says the Greeks work an average of 41 hours a week --- the longest in Europe and get paid much less. The left-wing opposition has often referred to the phenomenon as “Bulgarian salaries in a country of British prices”.</p>

<p>“It makes no sense whatsoever. When almost every other civilised country is enacting a four-day week, Greece decides to go the other way," Akis Sotiropoulos a member of the civil servants' union told the Guardian.</p>

<p>“In reality, this has been passed by a government ideologically committed to generating ever bigger profits for capital. Better productivity comes with better work conditions, a better quality of life [for employees] and that, we now know, is about less hours not more," he added</p>

<p>Research has shown that four-day week programmes help increase levels of productivity and improve levels of focus. In 2022, Belgium gave its workers the legal right to spread their working week over four days instead of five. Similar four-day week trials have also been carried out in countries like UK, Germany, Japan, South Africa and Canada.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former Home Secretary Suella Braverman won the newly-created Fareham and Waterlooville constituency in the 2024 UK general election. The Conservative Party leader defeated Labour's Gemma Furnivall by a margin of over 6,000 votes.</p>

<p>Following her victory, the right-wing leader issued an apology to the public for the Conservative Party's performance over the past 14 years. “I'm sorry that my party didn't listen to you,” she said in a <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/cnd0yndw0jeo ">press conference</a>. “The Conservative party has let you down.”</p>

<p>The Indian-origin MP acknowledged that the party had failed to keep its promises and acted entitled to the voters' support without delivering on their commitments. “You, the great British people, voted for us for over 14 years, and we did not keep our promises, despite promising time after time that we would do those things,” she said.</p>

<p>Ms Braverman talked about the need for the party to learn from its mistakes. She stated, “Because if we don't, bad, as tonight has been for my party, we'll have many worse nights to come.”</p>

<p>The former Home Secretary won the Fareham and Waterlooville seat after a challenging re-election bid. She was fired by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak in 2023 for publicly accusing the Metropolitan Police of bias in handling pro-Palestine protests. Ms Braverman, taking a stance against the Gaza rallies, called pro-Palestine demonstrations "hate marches" and suggested waving a Palestinian flag could be a criminal offence. She also accused police of favouritism and ignoring "pro-Palestinian mobs."</p>

<p>After her dismissal from office, she criticised the government's handling of migration. She argued that the pressure on public services is "unsustainable" and demanded stricter measures to reduce migration.</p>

<p>Ms Braverman had also spoken out against the record high migration figures, calling it a "slap in the face" to the British public who have consistently voted to reduce migration. "The pressure on housing, the NHS, schools, wages, and community cohesion, is unsustainable. When do we say: enough is enough?" she had said. She argued that Brexit provided the tools to control migration, and it was “time to use them.” She&nbsp;had also argued that some people were homeless as a "lifestyle choice."&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the first challenges for <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/uk-election-results-live-rishi-sunak-braces-for-huge-loss-as-early-results-herald-labour-keir-starmer-win-6037190">Keir Starmer</a> as the UK Prime Minister will be to restore the Labour Party's ties with India, which has been tumultuous due to their remarks on Kashmir. Starmer led the party to a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/uk-general-election-results-2024-live-keir-starmer-labour-party-tipped-for-historic-sweep-rishi-sunak-conservatives-6034921">landslide win in the general elections</a>, a result that <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/i-am-sorry-uk-pm-rishi-sunak-concedes-defeat-in-uk-polls-6037606">spelt doom for Rishi Sunak's Conservative Party</a>. &nbsp;</p>

<p>In the past, the Labour Party has often come under fire for their stand on the Kashmir issue. Their stance has been in stark contrast with the British government's view that Kashmir is a bilateral matter between India and Pakistan.</p>

<p>Under the leadership of Jeremy Corbyn, the party had in September 2019 passed an emergency motion calling for international observers to "enter" Kashmir and demand the right of self-determination for its people. It also called for Mr Corbyn to meet the high commissioners of both India and Pakistan to ensure there is "mediation" and restoration of peace and normality to prevent a potential nuclear conflict.</p>

<p>The resolution was slammed by India as an effort to "pander to vote-bank's interest".</p>

<p>Starmer, realising how important ties with the world's fastest-growing economy are, set out on a mission to fix the missteps made by his party in the past. His manifesto included a commitment to pursue a "new strategic partnership" with India, emphasizing the trade agreement.</p>

<p>During meetings with the Indian diaspora and public addresses, Starmer affirmed that Kashmir is an internal issue and will be resolved by India and Pakistan.</p>

<p>"Any constitutional issues in India are a matter for the Indian Parliament, and Kashmir is a bilateral issue for India and Pakistan to resolve peacefully," he said during a meeting with Labour Friends of India.</p>

<p>During his poll campaign, Starmer embarked on outreach efforts, denouncing Hinduphobia and celebrating cultural festivals like Diwali and Holi.</p>

<p>This policy adjustment aims to rebuild trust with the British-Indian community and foster stronger business ties with India, a critical aspect of Labour's international agenda.</p>

<p>The Labour Party, out of power for over a decade, has also outlined a foreign policy of "progressive realism," emphasizing pragmatic approaches to global challenges such as climate change and international security. Starmer's manifesto includes plans for a new strategic partnership with India, focusing on trade agreements and cooperation in technology, security, education, and environmental issues.</p>

<p>Labour passed the magic number of 326 seats for a House of Commons majority just before 5 am on Friday, confirming a change of government that was predicted for months but is still a remarkable turnaround for Starmer's party in a single electoral cycle. Starmer will now replace Sunak as prime minister on Friday, ending the Tories' 14-year grip on power.</p>]]></content:encoded>

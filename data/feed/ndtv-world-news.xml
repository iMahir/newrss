       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the last few years, there has been a spate of <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/8/30/mapping-africas-coups-detat-across-the-years">military coups</a> in Mali, Niger, Burkina Faso, Sudan and Guinea. <a href="https://projects.voanews.com/african-coups/">Military rule</a>, long dormant in African politics, is back.</p>

<p>Coup leaders have <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/guineas-suppression-protests-stokes-anger-junta-loses-shine-2023-05-25/">suppressed protest</a>, <a href="https://rsf.org/en/burkina-faso-authorities-confirm-conscription-three-missing-media-professionals-amidst-growing">gagged the media</a> and spilled much civilian blood in the name of <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2023/11/01/mali-islamist-armed-groups-army-target-civilians">public safety</a>. They claim to be protecting their people from enemies both internal and external – some invented to justify their takeovers and others very real (while military regimes have arguably made <a href="https://www.cfr.org/global-conflict-tracker/conflict/violent-extremism-sahel">violent extremism worse</a>, they did not create it).</p>

<p>The generals fight with one another as much as with their enemies, leading to duelling coups in <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/6/21/is-burkina-faso-on-the-cusp-of-another-coup">Burkina Faso</a> and a full-on civil war <a href="https://stanforddaily.com/2024/09/30/elamin-calls-for-attention-aid-to-sudan/">in Sudan</a>.</p>

<p>In west Africa, soldiers have shaken up the geopolitical order, pushing away <a href="https://theconversation.com/france-has-started-withdrawing-its-troops-from-mali-what-is-it-leaving-behind-170375">France</a> and the <a href="https://theconversation.com/niger-has-cut-military-ties-with-the-us-why-this-is-bad-for-the-sahels-security-226027">United States</a>, while drawing the Russian Federation (or more precisely, <a href="https://theconversation.com/russian-flags-waved-during-nigeria-protests-why-its-a-cause-for-concern-236611">Russia-funded mercenaries</a>) closer.</p>

<p>Outside observers, and a fair number of insiders, were blindsided by these events. That's because military rule, with its drab aesthetics and Cold War trappings, seemed like a relic of the past. Explanations for its return have mostly focused on meddling outsiders, <a href="https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/iron-curtain-sahel">especially Russia</a>. Others emphasise the inherent vice of African states – the weaknesses that were there from the beginning of independence, including poverty and corruption, that made people disenchanted with democracy.</p>

<p>I'm a <a href="https://history.uchicago.edu/directory/samuel-fury-childs-daly">military historian</a>, and over the last few years I watched with alarm as the history I was writing about military dictatorships in the 1980s became current events. Military rule has deep roots, as my open-access book <a href="https://library.oapen.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.12657/93926/Daly_9781478094180_txt.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y">Soldier's Paradise: Militarism in Africa After Empire</a> argues. The coups of the last few years are a return to one of independent Africa's most important political traditions: militarism.</p>

<p>Militarism, or rule by soldiers, is a form of government where military objectives blur into politics, and the values of the armed forces become the values of the state at large.</p>

<p>West Africa's recent string of coups can only be understood in the long view of postcolonial history. The military regimes of the past were brutally innovative. They made new rules, new institutions and new standards for how people should interact. They promised to make Africa an orderly and prosperous paradise. They failed, but their promises were popular.</p>

<h2>Africa's military regimes</h2>

<p><iframe aria-label="Locator map" data-external="1" frameborder="0" height="600" id="datawrapper-chart-dMthR" scrolling="no" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/dMthR/1/" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" title="" width="100%"></iframe></p>

<p>Militaries ruled by force, not consensus, but plenty of people liked their disciplinary verve. Whipping the public into shape, sometimes literally, had a real appeal to people who felt that the world had become too unruly. Independence did not always mean freedom, and soldiers' rigid ideas shaped decolonisation in ways that we're only starting to understand.</p>

<p>Long submerged by more hopeful ideological currents, militarism is now rising back to the surface of African politics. My <a href="https://doi.org/10.1215/9781478059820">book</a> describes where militarism came from, and why it lasted so long.</p>

<h2>Petty and paranoid</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/3876235">Between 1956 and 2001</a> there were about 80 successful coups, 108 failed ones and 139 plots across Africa south of the Sahara. <a href="https://projects.voanews.com/african-coups/">Some countries</a> had many coups (Sudan has the highest, with 18 known attempts since 1950) while others had none (like Botswana). But even in places where the military wasn't in charge, the threat of a military takeover shaped how civilians governed.</p>

<p>The successful coups produced military regimes that were remarkably durable. Their leaders promised their regimes would be “transitional” or “custodial” and that they would hand back power to civilians as soon as they could.</p>

<p>Few did, and in some countries military rule lasted for decades. This could involve a graveyard-like stability where a single soldier-king ruled for an entire generation (like Burkina Faso), or constant turmoil as one junta gave way to another (like Nigeria). Military governments were petty and paranoid – each officer knew he had a line of rivals behind him waiting for their moment.</p>

<p>In these “revolutions”, as coup plotters called their takeovers, a new ideology emerged. Militarism was a coherent and relatively consistent vision for society, even though not all military regimes were the same. It had its own political values (obedience, discipline), morals (honour, bravery, respect for rank), and an economic logic (order, which they promised would bring prosperity).</p>

<p>It had a distinct aesthetic, and a vision for what Africa should look and feel like. The military's internal principles became the rules of politics at large. Officers came to believe that the training they used to make civilians into soldiers could transform their countries from the ground up. Some came to believe, ironically, that only strict discipline would bring true freedom.</p>

<p>The army officers who took power tried to remake their societies along military lines. They had utopian plans, and their ideology could not be boiled down to the big ideas of their times, like capitalism and communism. There were military regimes of the left, right and centre; radical and conservative; nativist and internationalist.</p>

<p>Militarism was a freestanding ideology, not just American liberalism, Soviet socialism or European neocolonialism dressed up in a uniform. Powerful outsiders pulled some of the strings in African politics, but not all of them, and officers were proud of the fact that they followed no one's orders but their own.</p>

<h2>Military tyranny</h2>

<p>Part of militarism's appeal was its maverick independence, and military regimes endeared themselves to the public by cutting ties with unpopular foreigners, just like <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/05/france-departure-niger-failure-former-colonies">Niger</a> and <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/1/23/burkina-faso-ends-french-military-accord-says-will-defend-itself">Burkina Faso</a> did with France in 2023.</p>

<p>Soldiers ran their countries like they fought wars. Combat was their metaphor for politics. Their goal was to win – and they accepted that people would get hurt along the way.</p>

<p>But what did “winning” look like when the enemy was their own people? They declared war on <a href="https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v41/n09/adewale-maja-pearce/diary">indiscipline</a>, <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jsh/advance-article/doi/10.1093/jsh/shae038/7686204">drugs</a> and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108887748">crime</a>. To civilians, all of this was hard to distinguish from tyranny, and military rule felt like a long, brutal occupation.</p>

<p>No military dictatorship succeeded in making the martial utopia that soldiers promised. Other parts of government pushed back against the military's plans, and African judiciaries proved especially formidable opponents. Civil society groups fought them tooth and nail, and challenges came from abroad, especially from the African diaspora.</p>

<p>Like most revolutions that don't succeed, militarists blamed the public for not committing to their vision and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/pastj/gtac006">outsiders</a> for sabotaging them. They do this <a href="https://www.passblue.com/2024/10/01/special-report-burkina-fasos-harsh-words-for-the-un-but-praises-itself/">today, too</a>.</p>

<p>Today's military regimes don't seem to have the same long-term visions of their predecessors, but the longer they stay in power the more likely they are to start making plans. Despite <a href="https://freedomhouse.org/article/surge-military-coups-africa-threatens-human-rights-and-rule-law">all their promises</a> to return to the barracks, they don't seem to be going any time soon.</p>

<p>If we're trying to anticipate what the continent's military regimes might do next, it makes sense to look to the past. In the late 20th century, military regimes promised to make Africa into a “soldier's paradise”. That promise is part of their strategy today.<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iran could end its ban on acquiring nuclear weapons if Western sanctions are reimposed, its top diplomat told The Guardian in an interview published Thursday ahead of talks on the matter.</p>

<p>Iran is set to meet with Britain, France and Germany for talks on its nuclear programme on Friday after the three governments joined with the United States to have Tehran censured by the UN atomic watchdog.</p>

<p>Last week's chiding prompted a defiant response from Tehran, but its officials have since signalled willingness to engage with others ahead of the return of US president-elect Donald Trump, whose last administration pursued a policy of "maximum pressure" against the Islamic republic.</p>

<p>Iran insists on its right to nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, but according to UN's International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), it is the only non-nuclear-weapon state enriching uranium to 60 percent.</p>

<p>In an interview published on the eve of the talks, Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi warned frustration in Tehran over unmet commitments, such as lifting sanctions, was fuelling debate on whether the country should alter its nuclear policy.</p>

<p>"We have no intention to go further than 60 percent for the time being, and this is our determination right now," he told Britain's The Guardian newspaper.</p>

<p>But, he added, "there is this debate going on in Iran, and mostly among the elites... whether we should change our nuclear doctrine" as so far it has proven to be "insufficient in practice".</p>

<p>The 2015 nuclear deal between Tehran and major powers aimed to give Iran relief from crippling Western sanctions in exchange for limiting its nuclear programme to prevent it from developing a weapons capability.</p>

<p>Tehran has consistently denied any intention of pursuing atomic weapons.</p>

<p>Tehran's willingness to sit down with the three European governments so soon after the censure comes just weeks before Trump is set to return to the White House.</p>

<p>During his first term, Trump focused on reimposing heavy sanctions on Iran following his administration's unilateral withdrawal from the 2015 deal three years after it was agreed.</p>

<p>In retaliation for the US withdrawal, Tehran reduced its compliance with the deal, raising its uranium enrichment levels to 60 percent -- close to the 90 percent required for a nuclear bomb.</p>

<p><strong>'Legal obligations'</strong></p>

<p>Under the 2015 accord -- which will expire in October 2025 -- Iran's enrichment was capped at 3.67 percent.</p>

<p>Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has the final authority in Iran's decision-making, has issued a religious decree, or fatwa, prohibiting atomic weapons.</p>

<p>Iranian diplomat Majid Takht-Ravanchi, who serves as the political deputy to Araghchi, is scheduled to represent Iran in Friday's talks.</p>

<p>He will meet beforehand with Enrique Mora, deputy secretary general of the European Union's foreign affairs arm, according to the IRNA state news agency.</p>

<p>Last week, the 35-nation board of governors of the IAEA adopted a resolution condemning Iran for its lack of cooperation on nuclear issues.</p>

<p>Iran described as "politically motivated" the resolution brought by Britain, France, Germany and the United States.</p>

<p>In response, Tehran announced the launch of "new advanced centrifuges" designed to increase its stockpile of enriched uranium.</p>

<p>For Tehran, the goal of the talks on Friday is to avoid a "double disaster" scenario, in which it would face renewed pressures from both Trump and European nations, according to political analyst Mostafa Shirmohammadi.</p>

<p>He noted that Iran's support among European governments had been eroded by allegations it offered military assistance for Russia's invasion of Ukraine.</p>

<p>Iran has denied these accusations and hopes to mend relations with Europe, while also maintaining a firm stance.</p>

<p>The IAEA's censure resolution urged Iran to "fulfil its legal obligations" under the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) ratified in 1970, which requires member states to declare and maintain their nuclear materials under IAEA supervision.</p>

<p>In response, Araghchi, who was instrumental in the nuclear negotiations in 2015, said Iran was commissioning "several thousand advanced centrifuges".</p>

<p>The head of the Atomic Energy Organisation of Iran, Mohammad Eslami, said Wednesday that they had begun inserting gas into the centrifuges.</p>

<p>Centrifuges work by rapidly spinning uranium gas to increase the proportion of the fissile isotope U-235.</p>

<p>Iran's nuclear programme dates back to the late 1950s when the United States, then an ally, signed a civil cooperation agreement with Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>German investigators suspect a Berlin doctor of killing eight elderly patients under his care and setting fire to some of their homes to cover up his crimes, prosecutors said Thursday.</p>

<p>The unnamed suspect, 40, who worked in palliative care for a nursing service, was remanded in custody in August on suspicion of killing four women aged 72 to 94 and starting fires at their homes.</p>

<p>Prosecutors in Berlin have now linked the suspect to four more deaths of men and women aged between 61 and 83, they said.</p>

<p>Police in August said the man was being investigated on four counts of manslaughter, one count of arson and three counts of attempted arson.</p>

<p>The Berlin prosecutors said they were now treating the alleged killings as murder cases.</p>

<p>"The accused appears to have had no motive for killing the people other than the act of killing itself," they said, accusing him of a "lust for murder".</p>

<p>Police in August said the man was suspected of killing four female patients in the care of his nursing service in Berlin between June 11 and July 24.</p>

<p>In one case, an 87-year-old woman was resuscitated after emergency services arrived, but died later in hospital.</p>

<p>In another, the suspect allegedly started a blaze but the fire went out.</p>

<p>"When he realised this, he allegedly informed a relative of the woman and claimed that he was standing in front of her flat and that nobody was answering the doorbell," police said.</p>

<p>In the four new cases, which date back to the period from June 2022 to April 2024, the suspect is accused of killing two men and two women in Berlin.</p>

<p>In one case, he is suspected of administering a cocktail of medications to a 70-year-old female patient in her apartment in Berlin's Tempelhof district and then starting a fire to cover up his crime.</p>

<p>The fire department, called by a neighbour, was able to prevent the flames from spreading to the rest of the building.</p>

<p>He is also accused of administering deadly medications to two men, aged 70 and 83, and to a 61-year-old woman.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[David Crisafulli put the Queensland safer bill in place on Thursday - the first legislation of the government since its win. According to him, the legislation would "serve as a deterrence to crime. They will reduce the number of victims."]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Queensland's Liberal National Party government has introduced a contentious youth crime bill, acknowledging it will "directly discriminate" against children.&nbsp;</p>

<p>David Crisafulli, the premier, put the Queensland safer bill in place on Thursday - the first legislation of the government since its win. According to him, the legislation would "serve as a deterrence to crime. They will reduce the number of victims."</p>

<p>The legislation, dubbed "Queensland Safer," aims to increase maximum sentences for youth crimes, aligning with the party's "adult crime, adult time" election promise, as mentioned in <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/nov/28/queensland-youth-crime-laws-david-crisafulli-lnp-changes-children-life-sentences-murder" rel="noindex,nofollow">The Guardian</a>.</p>

<p>"The amendments will treat children less favourably than adults in the same circumstances and therefore directly discriminate on the basis of age, limiting their right to enjoy their right to liberty without discrimination, their right to equal protection of the law without discrimination and their right to equal and effective protection against discrimination," the statement says.</p>

<p>Based on the government's statement of compatibility with human rights, the bill will disproportionately affect Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children, who are already overrepresented in the criminal justice system.</p>

<p>Attorney General Deb Frecklington conceded that the bill may increase the number of children in state watch houses, resulting in "limitations to the protection from cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment" and undermining their right to humane treatment.</p>

<p>"Watchhouses are not appropriate or humane places in which to detain children (particularly for any lengthy period of time)", he said and added that the negative impact outweighs the aims of punishment.</p>

<p>Critics argue that the legislation violates human rights, particularly the principle of detention as a last resort, which will only apply to adults. The bill also allows children as young as 10 to be sentenced to life in prison for certain offenses.</p>

<p>The legislation has received backlash from human rights organisations, lawyers, experts and also the state's human rights commissioner.</p>

<p>Queensland's human rights commissioner, Scott McDougall, said that the new youth crime laws - which will bring about life sentences for children "who still have their baby teeth" are evidence that the "society that has lost its way".&nbsp;</p>

<p>Griffith University criminologist William Wood is of the opinion that prison does not have a positive impact in reducing crime. "Detention and prisons don't reduce crime, they produce crime", he said, adding that prison makes children tougher.</p>

<p>It will go to a parliamentary committee for eight days before returning to parliament in December for a final vote.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President Vladimir Putin on Thursday threatened to strike "decision-making centres" in Kyiv with Russia's new hypersonic missile, hours after Moscow pummelled Ukraine's energy grid in an attack that left a million people without power.</p>

<p>Russia fired more than 90 missiles and around 100 drones during the barrage, Kyiv said, in what the Kremlin chief called a "response" to Ukrainian strikes on his territory with Western missiles.</p>

<p>The nearly three-year war has seen a sharp escalation in recent days, with both sides deploying new weapons in a bid to gain the upper hand before US President-elect Donald Trump takes office in January.</p>

<p>"We do not rule out the use of Oreshnik against the military, military-industrial or decision-making centres, including in Kyiv," Putin told a press conference in the Kazakh capital Astana, referring to the hypersonic missile.</p>

<p>Kyiv's government district -- an area of the capital where multiple government buildings are located -- is protected with intense security, but fears for it have risen over the last week.</p>

<p>Russia last week tested its new Oreshnik ballistic missile on Ukraine, and Putin boasted on Thursday that firing several of the weapons at once would have the equivalent force of a nuclear strike, or a "meteorite" hit.</p>

<p>He earlier said the overnight barrage was a "response to continued attacks on our territory by (US) ATACMS missiles."</p>

<p>"As I have said repeatedly, there will always be a response from our side."</p>

<p>Putin also claimed Russia knew how many long-range weapons were given to Kyiv and where they were located.</p>

<p>Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said Putin's threat to strike Kyiv was a "testament to weakness" and said the West would not be perturbed by his words.</p>

<h2><strong>DESPICABLE ESCALATION</strong></h2>

<p>The fresh strikes came as Ukrainians braced for a tough winter, with much of its energy infrastructure already damaged by almost three years of war, and as Russian troops advanced in eastern Ukraine.</p>

<p>Tensions have ratcheted up over the last few weeks as both sides look to secure an advantage on the battlefield ahead of Trump's January inauguration.</p>

<p>Putin suggested he had hopes for Trump's second term, describing the Republican on Thursday as an "intelligent person", capable of finding a "solution", without specifying what he was referring to.</p>

<p>The Russian leader spoke hours after the overnight barrage that left more than half a million subscribers in Ukraine's western Lviv region cut off from electricity.</p>

<p>Another 280,000 in the western Rivne region and 215,000 in the northwestern Volyn region also lost power, officials said.</p>

<p>Ukraine's emergency services said the Russian overnight strikes inflicted damage in 14 regions across the country, with the nation's West hard-hit.</p>

<p>Zelensky said that Russia had also fired "cluster munitions" during the attack, calling it a "very despicable escalation of Russian terrorist tactics."</p>

<p>AFP journalists in the capital Kyiv heard blasts ring out over the capital overnight as air defence systems targeted Russian drones and missiles, with locals crowding into the underground metro system for cover.</p>

<p>The energy ministry said it was the 11th massive Russian attack on Ukraine's civilian energy infrastructure this year.</p>

<p>A senior UN official, Rosemary DiCarlo, this month warned Russian attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure may make this winter the "harshest since the start of the war".</p>

<h3><strong>PUTIN BOASTS OF NEW MISSILE</strong></h3>

<p>Since Moscow shocked the West and Kyiv by testing its new ballistic missile Oreshnik on the city of Dnipro last week, Russian officials have touted the arm's might.</p>

<p>In Astana, Putin said the Oreshnik could turn anything "into dust" and hit at a temperature comparable to "the surface of the sun." &nbsp;</p>

<p>He said Russia was "forced" to "test (the weapon) in combat conditions" after Kyiv's first strike on Russian territory using ATACMS.</p>

<p>Putin said Thursday the Oreshnik could travel "around three kilometres per second" and that its elements could reach a temperature almost "like the surface of the sun." &nbsp;</p>

<p>Russia also sentenced a lawyer, Dmitry Talantov, to seven years in prison for comparing Moscow's actions in Ukraine at the start of the invasion to "Nazi practises", a day after putting an invasion critic back on trial.</p>

<p>Ukraine, meanwhile, sentenced a woman in the eastern Donetsk region to 15 years in jail on high treason charges for passing sensitive military information to Russia.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[Referring to Trump's decision of imposing a 25% tariff on imports from Canada and Mexico, Kimmel said, "Some say this is the dumbest thing he's come up with since Don Jr."]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jimmy Kimmel in his show last night really doubted President-elect Donald Trump's grasp of economics.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Whoever would have guessed that the mail-order steak salesman who declared bankruptcy six times would be so bad with money?" He took a shot at Trump's financial mismanagement.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Referring to Trump's decision of imposing a 25% tariff on imports from Canada and Mexico, Kimmel said, "Some say this is the dumbest thing he's come up with since Don Jr."</p>

<p>"On January 20th, as one of my many first Executive Orders, I will sign all necessary documents to charge Mexico and Canada a 25% Tariff on ALL products coming into the United States, and its ridiculous Open Borders", Trump had said.</p>

<p>Kimmel remarked that the countries on which these taxes are imposed - China, Canada and Mexico, do not even pay the import taxes, it is the US companies that will pay those taxes which will ultimately come down to the consumer and result in "$40 avocados". He added, "So by next year, if you want extra guacamole, it'll be cheaper to go get it."</p>

<p>He went on to further lambast Trump's tariff plans by saying the aftermath will be inflation going through the roof.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bringing Canada into the picture, Trump took a dig at the beef between Drake and Kendrick Lamar as well, saying, "Poor Canada is like what did we do? I mean be honest is this because of Drake?"</p>

<p>He also pointed out the irony of some of Trump's merchandise being produced in China - a country he has repeatedly accused of having unfair trade practices and stealing jobs in America.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"So now if you want to purchase a tie from the Donald J.Trump collection, you better get it immediately, or it's going to cost an extra 10%," Kimmel quipped.</p>

<p>A recent investigation found that Trump's "God Bless the USA" Bibles were printed for only $3 in China and sold for $59.99 and if hand-signed by the former president, would sell for $1000. He never got around to disclosing how much he makes per sale though. Although the "Make America Great Again" are labelled as "Made In America", the origins of other products still remain murky.</p>

<p>Mexico has threatened Trump with retaliatory tariffs, while Canadian Prime Minister has had talks with the president-elect regarding the challenges.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin apologised to former German chancellor Angela Merkel on Thursday, saying he did not mean to scare her when he brought his pet Labrador to a meeting with her in 2007.</p>

<p>Merkel, who has a well-documented fear of the animals, recalled the tense encounter in her memoir released Tuesday, accusing Putin of inviting the pet as a "demonstration of power" and taking glee in her discomfort.</p>

<p>"I did not know that she was afraid of dogs," the Kremlin chief said Thursday at a press conference in the Kazakh capital Astana.</p>

<p>"I once again appeal to her via the media and say: 'Angela, please forgive me, I did not want to cause you any heartache.' On the contrary, I wanted to create a favourable atmosphere for our conversation," he added.</p>

<p>"If you ever -- I realise it is unlikely -- come again, I will not do it under any circumstances," Putin said.</p>

<p>Images from their 2007 meeting in the Russian city of Sochi showed Putin's black Labrador Retriever Konni sniffing around while the German leader sat in her chair, smiling nervously.</p>

<p>Merkel said of the 2007 encounter in her memoir: "I could tell from Putin's facial expressions that he was enjoying the situation."</p>

<p>Putin is known to be fond of dogs and has received them from visiting dignitaries on multiple occasions.</p>

<p>He received Konni as a gift from Sergei Shoigu, who later became his defence minister.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[From Iraq to Afghanistan to the US, basic freedoms for women are being eroded as governments start rolling back existing laws.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From Iraq to Afghanistan to the US, basic freedoms for women are being eroded as governments start rolling back existing laws.</p>

<p>Just a few months ago a ban on Afghan <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c20rq73p3z4o">women speaking in public</a> was the latest measure introduced by the Taliban, who took back control of the country in 2021. From August the ban included singing, reading aloud, reciting poetry and even laughing outside their homes.</p>

<p>The Taliban's ministry for the propagation of virtue and the prevention of vice, which implements one of the most radical interpretations of Islamic law, enforces these rules. They are part of a broader set of <a href="https://www.wbur.org/onpoint/2024/09/27/afghan-women-taliban-human-rights">“vice and virtue”</a> laws that severely restrict women's rights and freedoms. Women are even banned <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/afghan-women-cannot-pray-loudly-recite-front-women-says-taliban-minist-rcna177990">from reading the Quran</a> out loud to other women in public.</p>

<p>In the past three years in Afghanistan, the Taliban has taken away many basic rights from women who live there, so that there's very little that they are allowed to do.</p>

<p>From 2021, <a href="https://www.usip.org/tracking-talibans-Mistreatment-women">the Taliban started</a> introducing restrictions on girls receiving education, starting with a ban on coeducation and then a ban on girls attending secondary schools. This was followed by closing blind girls' schools in 2023, and making it mandatory for girls in grades four to six (ages nine to 12) to cover their faces on the way to school.</p>

<p>Women can no longer attend universities or receive a degree certificate nationally, or follow midwifery or nursing training in the Kandahar region. <a href="https://www.usip.org/tracking-talibans-Mistreatment-women">Women are no longer allowed</a> to be flight attendants, or to take a job outside the home. Women-run bakeries in the capital Kabul have now been banned. Women are mostly now unable to earn any money, or leave their homes. In April 2024, the Taliban in Helmand province told media outlets to even refrain from airing women's voices.</p>

<p>Afghanistan is ranked last on the <a href="https://giwps.georgetown.edu/the-index/">Women, Peace and Security Index</a> and officials at the UN and elsewhere have called it <a href="https://www.passblue.com/2023/06/21/the-gender-apartheid-happening-in-afghanistan-un-experts-say-should-be-labeled-an-international-crime/">“gender apartheid”</a>. Afghan women are putting their lives on the line — facing surveillance, harassment, assault, arbitrary detention, torture and exile — to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7hgYu43Krk">protest against</a> the Taliban.</p>

<p>Many diplomats discuss how important it is to <a href="https://press.un.org/en/2022/sc15038.doc.htm">“engage”</a> with the Taliban, yet this has not stopped the assault on women's rights. When diplomats “engage”, they tend to focus on counter-terrorism, counternarcotics, business deals, or <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2023/04/05/taliban-afghanistan-hostage-diplomacy-western-prisoners/">hostage</a> returns. Despite everything that has happened to Afghan women <a href="https://asiapacific.unwomen.org/en/digital-library/publications/2023/09/summary-report-of-country-wide-womens-consultations">over a short period</a>, critics suggest this rarely makes it onto diplomats' priority list.</p>

<h2>Iraq's age of consent</h2>

<p>Meanwhile, in Iraq, on August 4 2024, an amendment to Iraq's 1959 personal status law which would possibly lower the age of consent for marriage <a href="https://time.com/7011752/proposed-bill-amendment-iraq-could-allow-girls-as-young-as-nine-to-marry/">to nine years old</a> from 18 (or 15 with permission from a judge and parents) was proposed by member of parliament Ra'ad al-Maliki and supported by conservative Shia factions in the government.</p>

<p>The law would have the potential of having matters of family law – such as marriage – adjudicated by religious authorities. This change could not only legalise child marriage but also strip women of rights related to divorce, child custody and inheritance.</p>

<p>Iraq already has a high rate of <a href="https://www.girlsnotbrides.org/learning-resources/child-marriage-atlas/atlas/iraq/#:%7E:text=Minimum%20legal%20age%20of%20marriage%20below%2018%20years,-What's%20the%20prevalence&amp;text=28%25%20of%20girls%20in%20Iraq,%2C%20Muthana%20(27%25).">underage marriage</a>, with 7% of girls married by 15 years old, and <a href="https://www.girlsnotbrides.org/learning-resources/child-marriage-atlas/atlas/iraq/#:%7E:text=Minimum%20legal%20age%20of%20marriage%20below%2018%20years,-What's%20the%20prevalence&amp;text=28%25%20of%20girls%20in%20Iraq,%2C%20Muthana%20(27%25).">28%</a> married before the legal age of 18.</p>

<p>Unregistered marriages, not legally recorded in court but conducted through religious or tribal authorities, <a href="https://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00K2Z4.pdf">prevent girls from accessing civil rights</a>, and leave women and girls vulnerable to exploitation, abuse and neglect, with limited options for seeking justice.</p>

<p>Many women's groups have already <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/article/2024/aug/09/proposed-iraqi-law-change-would-legalise-child-say-activists">mobilised against the law</a>. But the amendment has <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2024/10/iraq-reject-changes-to-personal-status-law-which-would-allow-child-marriage-and-further-entrench-discrimination/">passed its second reading</a> in parliament. If introduced, it could pave the way for further modifications that deepen sectarian divides and move the country further away from a unified legal system. It would also be an especially troubling step backward in protecting children's rights and gender equality.</p>

<h2>Abortion rights in the US</h2>

<p>Meanwhile, in the US, women's access to abortion has been eroded significantly in the past few years. In late 2021, the US was officially labelled a <a href="https://msmagazine.com/backsliding-democracies/">backsliding democracy</a> by an international think-tank.</p>

<p>Six months later, the landmark US Supreme Court ruling of Roe v Wade, which had safeguarded the constitutional right to abortion for nearly 50 years, was overturned. This led to a cascade of restrictive laws, with more than a quarter of US states enacting outright bans or <a href="https://reproductiverights.org/maps/abortion-laws-by-state/">severe restrictions on abortion</a>.</p>

<p>Republican US congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene suggested, in May 2022, that women should stay celibate if they did not <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/marjorie-taylor-greene-celibacy-abortion-dont-have-sex-1707684">want to get pregnant</a>. If only all women had that choice. In fact, in the US a sexual assault occurs <a href="https://rainn.org/statistics/victims-sexual-violence">every 68 seconds</a>. One in every five American women has been the victim of <a href="https://www.nsvrc.org/statistics">an attempted or completed rape</a>. From 2009-13, US Child Protective Services agencies found strong evidence indicating that <a href="https://paar.net/child-family-services/statistics/">63,000 children per year were victims of sexual abuse</a>.</p>

<p>These developments reflect a troubling pattern. There is evidence from Donald Trump's first term that there could be further erosion of women's rights in his second presidency. During his previous term there were significant <a href="https://theconversation.com/how-a-second-trump-presidency-is-likely-to-threaten-abortion-rights-and-womens-healthcare-globally-243346">attempts to weaken healthcare access</a>, with his foreign policy reinstating the <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/gpr/2020/04/unprecedented-expansion-global-gag-rule-trampling-rights-health-and-free-speech">“global gag rule”</a> restricting access to women's reproductive healthcare worldwide via funding conditions.</p>

<h2>Fragility of women's rights</h2>

<p>If the world can tolerate the Taliban's abuses, Iraq's restrictive laws and the US restrictions on abortion access, it reveals the fragility of women's and girls' rights globally, and how easy it is to take them away.</p>

<p>The UN agency, UN Women, says it could take another <a href="https://www.unwomen.org/sites/default/files/2022-09/Progress-on-the-sustainable-development-goals-the-gender-snapshot-2022-en_0.pdf">286 years</a> to close the global gender gaps in legal protections. <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2024/06/gender-backlash-underscores-urgency-achieve-substantive-equality-women-and">No country has yet achieved gender equality</a>, based on the gender pay gap, legal equality and <a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/7625/gender-equality-worldwide/#topicOverview">social inequality</a> levels. Women and girls continue to face discrimination in all corners of the world, and it seems to be getting worse. But despite everything women <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNLvTBZD5AE">continue to resist</a>.<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Consular officials at the Indian consulate in Vancouver were recently informed by the Canadian authorities that they have been and continue to be under "audio and video surveillance" and that their "private communications" have also been "intercepted", the Centre informed Parliament on Thursday.</p>

<p>Minister of State for External Affairs Kirti Vardhan Singh in a written response in Rajya Sabha also said "respect for each other's concerns, territorial integrity and sovereignty are essential for a stable bilateral relationship".</p>

<p>Mr Singh was asked whether there are any instances of cyber surveillance or other forms of surveillance targeting Indian diplomats in Canada.</p>

<p>"Yes. Recently, consular officials at the Indian Consulate in Vancouver were informed by the Canadian authorities that they have been, and continue to be under audio and video surveillance and that their private communications have also been intercepted."</p>

<p>"Government of India lodged a strong protest with the Canadian High Commission in New Delhi on this issue vide its note verbale dated November 2, 2024 as these actions were a flagrant violation of all diplomatic provisions," Mr Singh said in his response.</p>

<p>The minister in his response also quoted a response of the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) spokesperson in his weekly briefing to the media recently here.</p>

<p>"By citing technicalities, the Canadian Government cannot justify the fact that it is indulging in harassment and intimidation. Our diplomatic and consular personnel are already functioning in an environment of extremism and violence."</p>

<p>"This action of the Canadian Government aggravates the situation and is incompatible with established diplomatic norms and practices," the spokesperson had said.</p>

<p>Mr Singh was also asked the details and the steps taken to ensure the safety of Indian diplomats.</p>

<p>"On the question of safety and security of Indian diplomats in Canada, the Government of India remains continuously engaged with the Canadian side to ensure that adequate protection is offered at all times to our diplomatic personnel and properties," he said.</p>

<p>The minister also said the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security, in its biennial National Cyber Threat Assessment (NCTA) report for 2025-2026 released on October 30, "placed India under 'Section 1 - Cyber threat from state adversaries'".</p>

<p>The MEA had responded to the report on November 2, stating that it was yet another example of Canada's "negative" approach to ties with India. As on other occasions, imputations have been made about India "without any evidence", the minister said, quoting MEA's response.</p>

<p>In a separate written response, Mr Singh also replied to queries on the steps taken for resolving issues with Canada and whether it is a fact that the Government of Canada has "expressed its inability" to provide minimum security to our embassy, consulates and diplomats.</p>

<p>"The two governments are in touch regarding the state of their bilateral ties. Respect for each other's concerns, territorial integrity and sovereignty are essential for a stable bilateral relationship.</p>

<p>"In this regard, Government of India has repeatedly urged the Canadian Government to take prompt and effective action against anti-India elements operating from its soil. This includes preventing secessionist and extremist elements from glorifying the assassination of our leaders issuing threats to our current political leadership and diplomats disrespecting and vandalising places of worship and espousing for the balkanisation of India by holding so-called 'referendums'," he added.</p>

<p>Mr Singh further said while the Canadian authorities have been able to provide "security protection to our diplomats and diplomatic properties", they have recently "expressed their inability to provide security cover to our consular camps from the violent acts of secessionist and extremist elements".</p>

<p>With nearly 1.8 million Indo-Canadians (accounting for about 4.7 per cent of Canada's population) and another 1 million comprising non-resident Indians including approximately 4,27,000 Indian students, Canada hosts one of the largest Indian diasporas abroad, he said.</p>

<p>"As such, the welfare, safety and security of Indian nationals in Canada is of utmost importance to Government of India," the Union minister said.</p>

<p>The relations between the two countries came under severe strain following Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's allegations in September last year of a "potential" involvement of Indian agents in Khalistan extremist Hardeep Singh Nijjar's killing.</p>

<p>New Delhi rejected Trudeau's charges as "absurd".</p>

<p>India has been maintaining that the main issue between the two countries is that of Canada is giving space to pro-Khalistan elements operating from Canadian soil with impunity.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For Vladimir Putin, Donald Trump's win couldn't come soon enough. Putin may reportedly <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/putin-ascendant-ukraine-eyes-contours-trump-peace-deal-2024-11-20/">accept a deal</a> where Moscow gains significant territory in Ukraine (about the size of the US state of Virginia) and Ukraine remains neutral and forgets about any plans to join NATO or the EU.</p>

<p>Though Ukraine is experiencing <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/asmagazine/2024/09/19/amid-growing-war-fatigue-some-ukrainians-more-willing-cede-land">war fatigue</a>, so is <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/world/in-russia-clear-signs-of-war-fatigue/">Russia</a>. Russia is making steady advances in the Donetsk region <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/ukraine-war-russia-joe-biden-us-weapons-troops-donetsk-region-deep-state-shortage/">of Ukraine</a>, but the Kremlin is still struggling to recruit soldiers for the conflict. The recent revelation that North Korean soldiers were fighting in <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cm2796pdm1lo">Ukraine attests to this</a>.</p>

<p>Even as Russia ramps up the war, with reports from Ukraine suggesting Moscow had fired its <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/c20726y20kvt">first intercontinental ballistic missile </a> of the war, it's become clear that a peace deal would be in the interests of Moscow, as much as Kyiv.</p>

<p>According to western assessments, around 115,000 to 160,000 Russian troops have died, 90% of the personnel it had at the beginning of the war. While another 500,000 <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/22/high-russian-death-toll-fails-shift-opinion-ukraine-war">have been injured</a>. To offset these losses, Russia has been recruiting 20,000 new soldiers <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cm2796pdm1lo">a month</a>.</p>

<p>Recruiting soldiers into the army has never been that easy in Russia even during peacetime. Recruits are often subject to hazing and bullying by more experienced soldiers, and as such joining the army is viewed as something to be avoided by many young Russian men. Known as <em>dedovshchina</em>, Russian bullying, hazing and beating of conscripts has been a notable pastime in the Russian military since the end of <a href="https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2020/02/17/decade-after-military-reform-hazing-plagues-russian-army-a69309">the 17th century</a>.</p>

<p>After the Soviet Union dissolved, the Russian media exposed the appalling conditions in the military, noting that troops suffered from poor medical care and severe malnutrition. Many Russians may also remember how poorly prepared conscripts were treated who were sent off to fight the war in Chechnya <a href="https://www.hrw.org/reports/2002/russia/russia1102-01.htm#:%7E:text=BACKGROUND%20ON%20CONSCRIPTION%20IN%20RUSSIA&amp;text=During%20the%20Soviet%20period%20conscription,unpopular%20with%20the%20Russian%20public">in the mid-1990s</a>.</p>

<p>The Russian government does not appear to be concerned about the average Russian soldier's <a href="https://www.fpri.org/article/2023/03/the-roots-of-russian-military-dysfunction/">safety and wellbeing</a>. Already unpopular during times of peace, this desperation to avoid being drafted into an active war becomes even more acute.</p>

<figcaption><span class="caption">Putin appears to be threatening to use nuclear weapons over the war in Ukraine but analysis suggests he is running out of replacement troops.</span></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The military is also seen as a major trap to catch the poor and underprivileged. Conscripts in the Russian army are viewed as meat for the grinder; their graves are ignored and the bodies are sometimes <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/119262/russia-burying-soldiers-unmarked-graves-hide-invasion">not identified</a>.</p>

<p>Most of the recruits have come from far east republics with large indigenous populations such as Bashkortostan, Chechnya, the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) and Dagestan — or as far <a href="https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2022/09/27/ethnic-minorities-hit-hardest-by-russias-mobilization-activists-say-a78879">from Moscow as possible</a>.</p>

<p>But even young men in Moscow are now facing an increasingly aggressive Russian state. Hundreds of thousands of Russians have fled the country, forcing the government to introduce a tougher draft law to <a href="https://theconversation.com/ukraine-war-russia-toughens-up-draft-law-to-round-up-more-people-for-the-frontlines-233048">round up troops</a>.</p>

<p>With the new law, implemented on November 1 this year, instead of receiving a draft notice through the post, draft notices are now delivered online. Once the notice enters a Russian man's digital mailbox, those called up are immediately barred from leaving the country and can face <a href="https://time.com/6270857/russia-ukraine-conscription-law-draft-dodgers/">stiff penalties</a> if they do attempt to leave.</p>

<p>This means that any time a Russian man is in contact with the government – to pay taxes, renew a passport or driver's license, or receive any type of government service – the Russian government can contact them and automatically give them their draft card. Having an online presence in Russia — such as having a bank account or a mortgage or car loan – also makes it harder to evade the draft.</p>

<p>Since the start of the war, Russian men have resorted to all kinds of tactics to avoid being drafted – faking that they had a drug dependency, falsifying medical documents and even in some cases breaking <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/roberthart/2022/10/04/russians-use-drastic-measures-to-avoid-putins-military-draft-including-self-mutilation/">their own bones</a>.</p>

<p>Moving locations within Russia or purchasing property in someone else's name was <a href="https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/odr/russia-mobilisation-draft-avoid-men-speak/">also a common tactic</a>, but now these strategies have become more difficult. Someone I interviewed for this article was drafted even though they had not lived in Moscow since 2006. Struggling to find recruits, the Russian government has resorted to going after Russian citizens who live abroad.</p>

<p>Russia has also notably drafted prisoners, which include <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-63517680">murderers and paedophiles</a>. This has caused Russia's <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/10/26/russia-prison-population-convicts-war/">prison population to plummet</a>.</p>

<p>But Putin is running out of men. To attract more recruits, the ministry of defence has increased pay, making it more lucrative than civilian jobs, doubling the bonus for people enlisting in <a href="https://www.military.com/daily-news/2024/07/31/russia-needs-men-so-badly-its-sign-bonuses-are-nearly-par-us-militarys.html">November of last year</a>.</p>

<p>Relying on the North Korean military offers another solution, but North Korean troops have no combat experience, use different military tactics and most don't speak Russian, which makes it more difficult to coordinate for specific combat operations.</p>

<p>Russian soldiers have complained that they do not know what to <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/language-barriers-inexperience-may-hamper-north-korean-troops-russias-rcna177756">do with them</a>. Though this would be widely unpopular in Belarus, Putin may try to force Belarus to offer support, as Belarusian soldiers are familiar with <a href="https://thehill.com/opinion/international/4993006-ukraine-north-korean-fighting/">Russian tactics and operations</a>.</p>

<p>In another sign of weakness, Putin is demonstrating that conventional war tactics are no longer enough. On November 19, Putin issued a threat that nuclear weapons could be used, in response to a Ukrainian attack using US made Atacms missiles in the western <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/putin-issues-warning-us-with-new-nuclear-doctrine-2024-11-19/">Bryansk region in Russia</a>.</p>

<p>Usually when conventional war strategies are working, there is no need to lower the threshold for <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-credible-is-russias-evolving-nuclear-doctrine/">nuclear use</a>.</p>

<p>Clearly, the war is not going particularly well for Ukraine either. They are struggling with their own recruitment issues <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-68255490">and territorial losses</a>. But it is a mistake to think that Putin is coming to the eventual negotiation table from a position of strength. Luckily for Putin, though he may be running out of men, a favourable deal may be on the horizon that fails to take this into account.<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Negotiators at the COP29 climate conference in Baku have struck a landmark agreement on <a href="https://unfccc.int/documents/644407">rules</a> governing the global trade of carbon credits, bringing to a close almost a decade of debate over the controversial scheme.</p>

<p>The deal paves the way for a system in which countries or companies buy credits for removing or reducing greenhouse gas emissions elsewhere in the world, then count the reductions as part of their own climate efforts.</p>

<p>Some have argued the agreement provides crucial certainty to countries and companies trying to reach net-zero through carbon trading, and will harness billions of dollars for environmental projects.</p>

<p>However, the rules contain several serious flaws that years of debate have failed to fix. It means the system may essentially give countries and companies permissions to keep polluting.</p>

<h2>What is carbon offsetting?</h2>

<p>Carbon trading is a system where countries, companies or other entities buy or sell “credits”, or permits, that allow the buyer to offset the greenhouse gas emissions they produce.</p>

<p>For example, an energy company in Australia that produces carbon emissions by burning coal may, in theory, offset their impact by buying credits from a company in Indonesia that removes carbon by planting trees.</p>

<p>Other carbon removal activities include renewable energy projects, and projects that retain vegetation rather than cutting it down.</p>

<p>Carbon trading was a controversial <a href="https://www.undp.org/energy/blog/what-article-6-paris-agreement-and-why-it-important">part of the global Paris climate deal</a> clinched in 2015.</p>

<p>The relevant part of the deal is known as “Article 6”. It sets the rules for a global carbon market, supervised by the United Nations, which would be open to companies as well as countries. Article 6 also includes trade of carbon credits directly between countries, which has begun operating even while rules were still being finalised.</p>

<p>Rules for carbon trading are notoriously complex and difficult to negotiate. But they are important to ensure a scheme reduces greenhouse gas emissions in reality, not just on paper.</p>

<h2>A long history of debate</h2>

<p>Over the past few years, annual COP meetings made some progress on advancing the carbon trading rules.</p>

<p>For example, COP26 in Glasgow, held in 2021, established an independent <a href="https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/bodies/constituted-bodies/article-64-supervisory-body">supervisory body</a>. It was also tasked with other responsibilities such as recommending standards for <a href="https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/A6.4-SBM014-A06.pdf?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email">carbon removal</a> and <a href="https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/A6.4-SBM014-A05.pdf?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email">methods</a> to guide the issuing, reporting and monitoring of carbon credits.</p>

<p>But the recommendations were rejected at COP meetings in <a href="https://www.downtoearth.org.in/climate-change/why-experts-are-concerned-about-adoption-of-article-64-rules-for-carbon-market-at-cop29#:%7E:text=The%20decision%20took%20note%20of,at%20both%20COP27%20and%20COP28.">2022 and 2023</a> because many countries viewed them as weak and lacking a scientific basis.</p>

<p>At a meeting in October this year, the supervisory body published its recommendations as “<a href="https://www.spglobal.com/commodityinsights/en/market-insights/latest-news/energy-transition/101024-un-carbon-body-adopts-standards-on-removals-methodologies-in-bid-to-fast-track-article-64">internal standards</a>” and so bypassed the COP approval process.</p>

<p>At this year's COP in Baku, the Azerbaijani hosts <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/nov/11/critics-say-approval-of-climate-credits-rules-on-day-one-of-cop29-was-rushed?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email">rushed through</a> adoption of the standards on day one, prompting claims proper process had not been followed</p>

<p>For the remaining two weeks of the conference, negotiators worked to further develop the rules. A final decision was adopted over the weekend, but has attracted <a href="https://carbonmarketwatch.org/2024/11/23/cop29-complex-article-6-rules-pave-way-to-unruly-carbon-markets/">criticism</a>.</p>

<p>For example, the <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/610ffde0dd5c39015edc6873/t/6743a75683179e029100e318/1732486999206/COP29+Launches+Dangerous+Market+Mechanisms+v.FINAL.pdf">Climate Land Ambition and Rights Alliance says</a> the rules risk “double counting” – which means two carbon credits are issued for only one unit of emissions reduction. It also claims the rules fail to prevent harm to communities – which can occur when, say, Indigenous Peoples are prevented from accessing land where tree-planting or other carbon-storage projects are occurring.</p>

<h2>Getting to grips with carbon removal</h2>

<p>The new agreement, known formally as the Paris Agreement Trading Mechanism, is fraught with other problems. Most obvious is the detail around carbon removals.</p>

<p>Take, for example, the earlier scenario of a coal-burning company in Australia offsetting emissions by buying credits from a tree-planting company in Indonesia. For the climate to benefit, the carbon stored in the trees should remain there as long as the emissions produced from the company's burning of coal remains in the atmosphere.</p>

<p>But, carbon storage in soils and forests is considered temporary. To be considered permanent, carbon must be stored <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08326-8">geologically</a> (injected into underground rock formations).</p>

<p>The final rules agreed to at Baku, however, fail to stipulate the time periods or minimum standards for “durable” carbon storage.</p>

<p>Temporary carbon removal into land and forests <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590332222003232">should not be used to offset</a> fossil fuel emissions, which stay in the atmosphere for millennia. Yet governments are already <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-53466-0">over-relying on such methods</a> to achieve their Paris commitments. The weak new rules only exacerbate this problem.</p>

<p>To make matters worse, in 2023, almost <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.12447">no carbon was absorbed</a> by Earth's forests or soils, because the warming climate increased the intensity of drought and wildfires.</p>

<p>This trend raises questions about schemes that depend on these natural systems to capture and store carbon.</p>

<h2>What next?</h2>

<p>Countries already can, and do, trade carbon credits under the Paris Agreement. Centralised trading will occur under the new scheme once the United Nations sets up a registry, expected next year.</p>

<p>Under the new scheme, Australia should rule out buying credits for land-based offsets (such as in forests and soil) to compensate for long-lasting emissions from the energy and industry sectors.</p>

<p>Australia should also revise its national carbon trading scheme along the same lines.</p>

<p>We could also set a precedent by establishing a <a href="https://climateintegrity.org.au/carbon-removals">framework</a> that treats carbon removals as a complement — not a substitute — for emissions reduction.<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>What is Nigeria's cryptic pregnancy scam?</h2>

<p>BBC Africa Eye has investigated a disturbing fertility scam in Anambra State, Nigeria where desperate women are shelling hundreds of dollars for this treatment that gives desperate women false pregnancies.</p>

<h3>What constitutes this "cryptic" pregnancy?</h3>

<p>Women who come to these clinics are warned not to visit doctors or hospitals as the "baby" will not be detected by any scan or test, since the scammers claim they are growing outside the womb.</p>

<h3>What comes under the treatments?</h3>

<p>The women who come in for these treatments are given mysterious injections that claim that couples can "select" the sex of their future baby which is medically impossible. They are also handed crushed pills, some to take home, a substance inserted into the vagina and instructions on when to have intercourse.</p>

<h3>What happens after the pregnancy reaches full term?</h3>

<p>When it is time to deliver the baby, the "pregnant" women are told labour can only be induced with a "rare and expensive drug" requiring payment, post which they are sedated and wake up with a Caesarean-like incision mark. Others are given an injection which makes them hallucinate and believe they are giving birth.</p>

<h3>What do these scams charge?</h3>

<p>The initial "pre-pregnancy" treatment costs 350,000 naira ($205; £165). The expensive drug that induces labour costs around 1.5 and two million naira ($1,180; £945).</p>

<h3>How do the scammers complete the "treatment"?</h3>

<p>According to authorities, the scammers look for new-born babies and women who are young, pregnant and vulnerable in a country where abortion is not legal. Some women are tricked and some sell their babies. A woman who was too scared to tell her family about her pregnancy, was offered 800,000 naira ($470; £380) for the baby.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[The Israeli military on Thursday said it hit a facility in southern Lebanon belonging to Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah, a day after a ceasefire between the group and Israel began.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel said it conducted an air strike on a Hezbollah weapons facility on Thursday, the first since a ceasefire in the war in Lebanon took effect.</p>

<p>The truce, which came into force on Wednesday, seeks to end a war that has killed thousands in Lebanon and sparked mass displacements in both Lebanon and Israel.</p>

<p>The war began with Hezbollah firing into Israel in support of its Palestinian ally Hamas and its unprecedented October 7 attack on Israel.</p>

<p>Israel shifted its focus from Gaza to Lebanon in September to secure its northern border from Hezbollah attacks, dealing the Iran-backed Shiite Muslim movement a series of heavy blows.</p>

<p>Lebanon deployed troops and tanks on Thursday across the country's south, where Hezbollah has long held sway, where only the army and UN peacekeepers are to maintain a presence under the terms of the ceasefire.</p>

<p>"A short while ago, terrorist activity was identified in a facility used by Hezbollah to store mid-range rockets in southern Lebanon," the Israeli military said, adding that "the threat was thwarted" by its air force.</p>

<p>Nazih Eid, mayor of Baysariyeh in south Lebanon, told AFP a strike had hit an area of his town.</p>

<p>"They targeted a forested area not accessible to civilians," he said.</p>

<p>The deal to end the war in Lebanon was brokered by Israel's top ally the United States and France.</p>

<p>Under the agreement, Israeli troops will hold their positions but "a 60-day period will commence in which the Lebanese military and security forces will begin their deployment towards the south", a US official told reporters on condition of anonymity.</p>

<p>Then, Israel should begin a phased withdrawal without a vacuum forming that Hezbollah or others could rush into, the official said.</p>

<p><strong>Two wounded</strong></p>

<p>The Israeli and Lebanese militaries have both called on residents of frontline villages to avoid returning home immediately.</p>

<p>Earlier on Thursday, Israeli fire wounded two people in a border village, according to Lebanon's official National News Agency.</p>

<p>The Israeli army said that "over the past hour, several suspects were identified arriving with vehicles to a number of areas in southern Lebanon, breaching the conditions of the ceasefire".</p>

<p>The army "opened fire toward them", the statement said, adding that the Israeli military "remains in southern Lebanon and will actively enforce violations of the ceasefire agreement".</p>

<p>For the most part, however, the ceasefire appeared to be holding.</p>

<p>A Lebanese army source said its forces were "conducting patrols and setting up checkpoints" south of the Litani River without advancing into areas where Israeli forces were still present.</p>

<p>The Israeli army on Thursday announced a nighttime curfew for areas south of the river, which are located near the border.</p>

<p><strong>Devastation</strong></p>

<p>While there was joy around Lebanon that the war has ended, the country faces a long recovery.</p>

<p>Tens of thousands of Lebanese who fled their homes during the war have headed back to their towns and villages, only to find them devastated.</p>

<p>"Despite all the destruction and the sorrow, we are happy to be back," said Umm Mohammed Bzeih, a widow who fled the southern village of Zibqin with her four children two months ago.</p>

<p>"I feel as if our souls have returned," she said, visibly exhausted as she swept up the shattered glass and rubble that carpeted the floor.</p>

<p>In the border village of Qlayaa, residents threw rice and flowers to celebrate the arrival of Lebanese soldiers.</p>

<p>The majority-Christian village is nestled in an area that is home mostly to Shiite Muslim communities.</p>

<p>Lebanon is deeply divided along political and sectarian lines, with Hezbollah long dominant among the Shiite population.</p>

<p>"We only want the Lebanese army," chanted residents of Qlayaa, as they clapped and cheered for the troops and waved the Lebanese flag.</p>

<p><strong>Crisis</strong></p>

<p>Even before the conflict, Lebanon had been wracked for years by political and economic crises, with World Bank data from earlier this year indicating poverty had tripled in a decade.</p>

<p>On Thursday, there was a glimmer of hope as the official National News Agency reported parliament would meet to elect a president on January 9, following a two-year vacuum.</p>

<p>Hezbollah, the only armed group that did not surrender its weapons following the 1975-90 civil war, built its popularity by providing health and education services.</p>

<p>It has maintained a formidable arsenal, supplied chiefly by Iran, which is widely regarded as more powerful than that of the Lebanese army.</p>

<p>Hezbollah proclaimed on Wednesday that it had achieved "victory" in the war against Israel, after the truce took effect.</p>

<p>It also said that its fighters would "remain in total readiness to deal with the Israeli enemy's ambitions and its attacks".</p>

<p>But the war saw Israel deal Hezbollah a string of unprecedented blows, key among them the killing in September of its longtime leader Hassan Nasrallah.</p>

<p>Hezbollah lawmaker Hassan Fadlallah told AFP his group was cooperating on the army's deployment in the south.</p>

<p>There is "full cooperation" with the Lebanese state in strengthening the army's deployment, he said, adding the group had "no visible weapons or bases" but "nobody can make residents leave their villages".</p>

<p><strong>Scepticism</strong></p>

<p>In northern Israel, which has come under steady attack from Hezbollah for more than a year, there was hope tinged with scepticism over whether the truce might last.</p>

<p>Nissim Ravivo, a 70-year-old in the coastal city of Nahariya near the border with Lebanon, voiced disappointment.</p>

<p>"It's a shame, we should have continued for at least another two months and finished the job," he said. "We still don't feel safe and we are not happy about it."</p>

<p>Lebanon says at least 3,961 people have been killed in the country since October 2023, most of them in recent weeks.</p>

<p>On the Israeli side, the hostilities with Hezbollah killed at least 82 soldiers and 47 civilians, authorities there say.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>South Korean pop group NewJeans announced on Thursday that they are leaving their label ADOR, accusing the company of "mistreatment". "ADOR has neither the ability nor the will to protect NewJeans," said group member Hanni at an emergency press conference, according to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/2024-11-28/business/industry/NewJeans-members-to-terminate-contract-with-ADOR/2188944"><em>Korea JoongAng Daily</em></a>. "Staying at the agency will only prolong our psychological pain and waste our time," Hanni further said. Responding to the allegations, ADOR said it never violated the exclusive contracts with members of NewJeans and that it still stands.</p>

<p>The announcement by the pop group soon started circulating on social media and NewJeans became one of the top trends on X.</p>

<p>The <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://x.com/slist2015/status/1862114617935487109" rel="noindex,nofollow">press conference was held</a> in Seoul at 8.30 pm (local time) on Thursday. More than 100 reporters were present at the event.</p>

<p>NewJeans said it sent a list of demands to ADOR on November 14 and asked the agency to reply within 14 days. The company claims it complied with the deadline, still the pop stars called the press conference.</p>

<p>ADOR "repeatedly asked the artists" to meet with the company but they refused, according to the agency.</p>

<p>"Even now, we hope to sit down for an honest talk. ADOR will continue to support NewJeans, our artists, and help them grow to become global artists," the company said in a statement.</p>

<p>ADOR emphasised that the contract still stands. "ADOR never breached the contract, and just because (the members of NewJeans) argue that trust has been broken, it does not mean that the contracts can be terminated," it said in a statement.</p>

<p>"The exclusive contracts between the NewJeans members and ADOR still stand. We ask that (the members) continue their activities with ADOR just as they have done until now," the agency further said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Australian lawmakers passed landmark rules to ban under 16s from social media on Thursday, approving one of the world's toughest crackdowns on popular sites like Facebook, Instagram and X.</p>

<p>The bill has now passed both parliamentary chambers with bipartisan support, and social media firms will soon be expected to take "reasonable steps" to prevent young teens from having accounts.</p>

<p>The firms -- who face fines of up to Aus$50 million (US$32.5 million) for failing to comply -- have described the laws as "vague", "problematic" and "rushed".</p>

<p>The legislation passed parliament's lower chamber on Wednesday and passed the Senate late on Thursday evening. It is now all but certain to become law.</p>

<p>Centre-left Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, eyeing an election early next year, has enthusiastically championed the new rules and rallied Aussie parents to get behind it.</p>

<p>In the run up to the vote, he painted social media as "a platform for peer pressure, a driver of anxiety, a vehicle for scammers and, worst of all, a tool for online predators".</p>

<p>He wanted, he said, young Australians "off their phones and onto the footy and cricket field, the tennis and netball courts, in the swimming pool".</p>

<p><strong>- 'I'll find a way' -</strong></p>

<p>But young Australians like 12-year-old Angus Lydom, are not impressed.</p>

<p>"I'd like to keep using it. And it'll be a weird feeling to not have it, and be able to talk to all my friends at home," he told AFP.</p>

<p>Many are likely to try to find ways around it.</p>

<p>"I'll find a way. And so will all my other friends" Lydom said.</p>

<p>Similarly, 11-year-old Elsie Arkinstall said there was still a place for social media, particularly for children wanting to watch tutorials about baking or art, many of which appear on social media.</p>

<p>"Kids and teens should be able to explore those techniques because you can't learn all those things from books," she added.</p>

<p>On paper, the ban is one of the strictest in the world.</p>

<p>But the current legislation offers almost no details on how the rules will be enforced -- prompting concern among experts that it will simply be a symbolic piece of legislation that is unenforceable.</p>

<p>It will be at least 12 months before the details are worked out by regulators and the ban comes into effect.</p>

<p>Some companies will likely be granted exemptions, such as WhatsApp and YouTube, which teenagers may need to use for recreation, school work or other reasons.</p>

<p>Late amendments were introduced to ensure government-issued digital ID cannot be used as a means of age verification.</p>

<p><strong>- Australia leads the way -</strong></p>

<p>Social media expert Susan Grantham told AFP that digital literacy programmes that teach children to think "critically" about what they see online should be adopted -- similar to a model used in Finland.</p>

<p>The legislation will be closely monitored by other countries, with many weighing whether to implement similar bans.</p>

<p>Lawmakers from Spain to Florida have proposed social media bans for young teens, although none of the measures have been implemented yet.</p>

<p>China has restricted access for minors since 2021, with under-14s not allowed to spend more than 40 minutes a day on Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok.</p>

<p>Online gaming time for children is also limited in China.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A young gorilla at a Canadian zoo died after a staff member accidentally crushed its head with a hydraulic door. According to the <em>New York Post</em>, the incident took place on November 12 at the Calgary Zoo in Alberta. Eyare, a 2-year-old western lowland gorilla, was "roaming bedroom to bedroom" with its gorilla mates when a staffer was trying to separate it from the troop for a solo training session, the zoo said in a statement. However, the carer "mistakenly activated the wrong door, resulting in Eyare being struck by the door and sustaining traumatic head injuries," it added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The gorilla team retrieved Eyare from the troop and the veterinary team immediately commenced lifesaving measures, including CPR. Sadly, Eyare succumbed to her injuries," said Colleen Baird, the zoo's director of animal care, per the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/26/world-news/gorilla-crushed-to-death-due-to-zoo-carers-human-error/"><em>Post</em></a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"This tragedy has struck us all in the deepest way imaginable. Eyare's short but impactful life brought so much joy to our community, and she will be deeply missed by all. We will do everything we can to prevent future incidents," Mr Baird added.</p>

<p>Separately, the zoo said that the death "was determined to be an accident caused by human error". &nbsp;The staff member involved in the incident was immediately removed from the workplace and will be reassigned to another area of the zoo, they continued.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to authorities, other staff will also face fresh training. The zoo will implement preventive measures - including animal behavioural training - to avoid another incident like this in the future. Moreover, the zoo is also looking at safer alternatives to hydraulic doors "to enhance overall safety and improve staff confidence while reducing safety risks".&nbsp;</p>

<p>Following the incident, Animal Justice, a Canadian nonprofit that advocates for the humane treatment of animals, called for an independent investigation into animal safety and oversight at the Alberta facility. "The Calgary Zoo appears to have a higher rate of animal deaths compared to other zoos, and in light of Eyare's death there should be a systematic review of the zoo's operations and practices, conducted transparently by the government or another outside party," said Camille Labchuk, the nonprofit's executive director, per <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/22/americas/calgary-zoo-gorilla-death/index.html" rel="noindex,nofollow"><em>CNN</em></a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, the Calgary zoo refuted the claim, saying that they adhere to operational standards and have upheld accreditation by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums' independent Accreditation Commission since 1978.</p>

<p>"We love and care for more than 4,000 animals representing over 100 species that call our zoo home. Animal deaths caused by human error are extraordinarily rare. In the past 10 years, we have experienced two such losses-a North American river otter in 2016 and 'Eyare' last week," a spokesperson for the Calgary Zoo said in a statement to <em>CNN</em>.</p>

<p>"While uncommon, even one human-caused mortality is one too many. These tragic incidents have been used as critical learning opportunities, driving us to review and to strengthen protocols to uphold the highest standards of care," they added.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 53-year-old Indian-origin neurosurgeon in the US was fined over USD 2 million for medicare fraud after falsely claiming to perform surgeries to implant electro-acupuncture devices.</p>

<p>Dr Rajesh Bindal from the Houston area was fined USD 2,095,946 after being accused of defrauding Medicare and the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP), US Attorney Alamdar S Hamdani said on Wednesday.</p>

<p>According to federal investigators, Bindal billed for invasive procedures typically requiring operating rooms, yet no such surgeries were conducted. Instead, the devices were merely taped behind patients' ears, often falling off within days.</p>

<p>In some cases, the procedures were performed not by Dr Bindal himself but by a device sales representative or a physician assistant at his clinic, Texas Spine &amp; Neurosurgery Center P.A., rather than in a proper surgical setting.</p>

<p>"A neurosurgeon like Dr Bindal knows the difference between real surgery and sticking a device behind someone's ear," said US Attorney Hamdani. "Despite being among the highest-paid specialists in medicine, he chose personal greed over integrity and patient care."</p>

<p>"This type of fraud not only wastes taxpayer dollars but undermines trust in healthcare providers and critical programs like Medicare. Dr Bindal's actions deceived both the system and vulnerable patients," said Jason E Meadows, Special Agent in Charge of the Department of Health and Human Services - Office of Inspector General.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Ukrainian officials have accused Russia of "weaponising winter" and stockpiling missiles to launch pre-winter aerial campaigns in Ukraine. "They were helped by their crazy allies, including from North Korea," Andrii Yermak, head of Ukraine's presidential office wrote in a Telegram post.</p>

<p>Russian president Vladimir Putin has said this is a response to Ukraine's attacks with UK and US supplied weapons.</p>

<p>As stated by Ukraine's president Vlodymyr Zelenskyy, cluster munitions were particularly used against civilians and energy infrastructure. He has called the attack out as a "very mean escalation" in the conflict.</p>

<p>"I have a power bank for charging my phone, but I did not buy a more powerful station because I did not take it seriously that there would be such attacks and that missiles would reach us. But it did reach us," Valeriy Dorotiy, a resident of Lutsk, told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/28/europe/ukraine-russia-war-power-cut-intl-hnk/index.html" rel="noindex,nofollow">CNN.</a></p>

<p>Zelensky urged allies for help regarding air defence systems saying that attacks like this prove that the systems save lives.</p>

<p>Speaking of Russian arms capabilities, Putin said "Let no one forget about the Kalibr systems, the Kinzhal and Tsirkon hypersonic missile systems that are in our arsenal, which have no analogues in the world in terms of their characteristics." He added that their production is being increased in full swing and that the Ukrainian leaders are "begging their masters for other military equipment".</p>

<p>Putin declared that Russia reserves the right to attack military targets in countries that permit their weapons to be used against Russia.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Elon Musk, who is busy promoting Donald Trump for the keenly-watched US presidential election on November 5, has reportedly laid off more employees from his X social media platform.</p>

<p>According to a report in The Verge, a new wave of layoffs has hit X, primarily affecting its engineering department, citing sources inside X and posts on the workplace forum Blind.</p>

<p>"The exact scale of the job cuts remains unknown. These cuts come just two months after staffers were required to submit a one-page summary telling leadership their contributions to the company," the report claimed.</p>

<p>Musk or X were yet to comment on the report.</p>

<p>Recently, the tech billionaire had reportedly sent an email to X staff about their much-anticipated stock grants - although with a catch.</p>

<p>In an email to staff seen by The Verge, the social media platform planned to award stock options based on the anticipated impact of employees.</p>

<p>"That means staff have to submit a one-page summary telling leadership their contributions to the company in order to get their stock," said the report.</p>

<p>Keeping in mind how the company has continued to struggle under Musk's ownership, employees have been bracing for more layoffs.</p>

<p>Musk bought X (then called Twitter) in 2022 and laid off more than 6,000 employees- roughly 80 per cent of the company's staff.</p>

<p>The workforce was forced to justify their roles and even judge whether their own colleagues should be retained.</p>

<p>The job cuts affected departments like diversity and inclusion teams as well as product development and design. Even, Twitter's content moderation team was not spared.</p>

<p>In January this year, X reportedly fired 1,000 employees from its 'safety' staff which was responsible for stopping abusive content online. Out of these 80 per cent were software engineers that were focused on "trust and safety issues".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 36-year-old man, who earlier worked as a programmer for Nvidia, spent around a year of his life and invested a considerable amount of money to discover the world's largest known prime number.</p>

<p>Officially named as 'M136279841,' Luke Durant's discovery consists of 41,024,320 digits, marking the maiden prime breakthrough in nearly six years, CNN reported.</p>

<p>A prime number is a whole number, which can only be divided by 1 or itself, such as 2, 3, 5, 7, and so on.</p>

<p>Based in San Jose, California, Luke Durant's historic finding has been classified as a Mersenne prime, named after French monk Marin Mersenne. He studied these numbers over 350 years ago.</p>

<p>As per the report, Mersenne primes are rare, making Durant's discovery even more impressive. In simple terms, to consider a number as Mersenne prime, it needs to be written in the form '2ᵖ-1'.</p>

<p>While other large prime numbers are used in some applications for protecting internet security, the Mersenne primes remain crucial for other key reasons.</p>

<p>"The historical record of the world's largest prime tells us something about the historical capability of computers, and in particular it tells us something about the progress of humanity in this area," <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://edition.cnn.com/science/world-largest-prime-number-found/index.html" rel="nofollow,noindex">CNN</a> quoted Dr Kevin Buzzard, professor of pure mathematics at Imperial College, London, as saying.</p>

<p>Mr Durant's research was announced on October 21 by the Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search (GIMPS), a community-based project.</p>

<p>An example of citizen science, GIMPS allows non-specialists to discover the largest known primes, according to Buzzard "I recognised that the GIMPS community has put together an incredible system with amazing technology for searching for huge prime numbers," Mr Durant said.</p>

<p>For this project, Luke Durant first got himself familiar with its software and learned to use cloud computers. Later on, he combined these elements that enabled him to run enough worldwide systems for creating an incredibly speedy supercomputer.</p>

<p>People from different cities around the world are volunteers in the GIMPS community as they run the project's software on their personal computer systems to search for new primes.</p>

<p>Luke Durant was inspired to hunt for the world's largest primes due to his interest in developing large computing systems as well as exploring the limitations of the laws of physics. Through his effort, he "wanted to push the boundaries of the known universe in whatever small way I was able".</p>

<p>"These enormous prime numbers are, in some senses, the largest 'unique pieces of information' in the known universe," he said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US has imposed sanctions on 275 individuals and entities, including 15 from India, for allegedly supporting Russia's military-industrial base.</p>

<p>Companies from China, Switzerland, Thailand, and Turkiye have also been slapped with sanctions for supplying Russia with advanced technology and equipment that it desperately needs to support its war machine, the Department of Treasury said in a statement on Thursday.</p>

<p>In addition to disrupting global evasion networks, this action also targets domestic Russian importers and producers of key inputs and other material for Russia's military-industrial base, the statement said.</p>

<p>“The United States and our allies will continue to take decisive action across the globe to stop the flow of critical tools and technologies that Russia needs to wage its illegal and immoral war against Ukraine,” Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Wally Adeyemo said.</p>

<p>“As evidenced by today's action, we are unyielding in our resolve to diminish and degrade Russia's ability to equip its war machine and stop those seeking to aid their efforts through circumvention or evasion of our sanctions and export controls,” Adeyemo said.</p>

<p>The State Department has also targeted sanctions evasion and circumvention in multiple third countries, including several China-based companies exporting dual-use goods that fill critical gaps in Russia's military-industrial base and entities and individuals in Belarus related to the Lukashenka regime's support for Russia's defence industry, the statement said.</p>

<p>The US also targeted several senior Russian Ministry of Defence officials and defence companies and those supporting Russia's future energy production and exports.</p>

<p>As per the list released by the Department of Treasury, the India-based companies are Abhar Technologies and Services Private Limited; Denvas Services Private Limited; Emsystech; Galaxy Bearings Ltd; Orbit Fintrade LLP; Innovio Ventures; KDG Engineering Private Limited; and Khushbu Honing Private Limited.</p>

<p>The Indian companies also include Lokesh Machines Limited; Pointer Electronics; RRG Engineering Technologies Private Limited; Sharpline Automation Private Limited; Shaurya Aeronautics Private Limited; Shreegee Impex Private Limited; and Shreya Life Sciences Private Limited.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, the US imposed sanctions on <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/russia-ukraine-war-us-cracks-down-on-indian-firms-for-supplies-to-russian-companies-6913424">nearly 400 entities and individuals</a> for enabling Russia's illegal war against Ukraine.</p>

<p>"The Department of State is targeting sanctions circumvention by parties in multiple third countries, several senior Russian Ministry of Defence officials and defence companies, and those that support the development of Russia's future energy production and exports," Secretary of State Antony Blinken had said in a statement on Wednesday.</p>

<p>The US, he said, is imposing sanctions on several Chinese companies exporting dual-use goods that fill critical gaps in Russia's military-industrial base as well as entities and individuals connected to the Lukashenka regime's support for Russia's defence industry.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NASA's 47-year-old Voyager 1 spacecraft recently established contact with Earth after a brief halt with the help of a radio transmitter that has not been used since 1981. NASA engineers at Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in California re-established contact with the spacecraft on October 24.</p>

<p>The spacecraft, which is in interstellar space over 15 billion miles away, experienced a brief interruption in communication on October 16 due to a shutdown of one of its transmitters. This shutdown was likely triggered by the spacecraft's fault protection system, which powers down certain systems when power usage is too high.</p>

<p>According to NASA, a message takes around 23 hours to travel one way - from Earth to Voyager 1 and vice-versa. On October 16, when the NASA engineers sent a command to the spacecraft, they could not detect its response till October 18. A day later, communication with Voyager 1 stopped completely.</p>

<p>After an investigation, the space agency team discovered that Voyager 1's fault protection system had switched the spacecraft to a second, lower-power transmitter.</p>

<p>Voyager 1 has two radio transmitters, but has been using only one for years called an 'X-band'. However, the other transmitter - the 'S-band' - uses a different frequency which has not been employed since 1981.</p>

<p>Presently, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/science/nasa-identifies-9-potential-landing-sites-for-artemis-iii-mission-near-moon-s-south-pole-6915265">NASA</a> has opted to avoid switching back to the X-band transmitter until they can determine what activated the fault protection system - which may take weeks.</p>

<p>"Engineers are being cautious because they want to determine whether there are any potential risks to turning on the X-band. In the meantime, engineers sent a message to Voyager 1 on October 22 to check that the S-band transmitter was working and received confirmation on October 24. But it's not a fix the team wants to rely on for too long," Voyager mission assurance manager, Bruce Waggoner told CNN.</p>

<p>Voyager 1 was launched after Voyager 2, but because of a faster route it exited the asteroid belt earlier than its twin, and it overtook Voyager 2 on December 15, 1977. The spacecraft is the first human-made object to venture into interstellar space.</p>

<p>The spacecraft was the first to cross the heliosphere - the boundary where the influences from outside our solar system are stronger than those from the Sun.</p>

<p>So far, the Voyager 1 has discovered a thin ring around Jupiter and two new Jovian moons - Thebe and Metis. It also found five new moons and a new ring called 'G-Ring' at Saturn.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Israel's 'Iron Beam', designed to use high-power laser to down projectiles, will be operational within a year.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel's 'Iron Beam', designed to use high-power laser to down projectiles, will be operational within a year, according to reports. The laser defense system will complement the country's Iron Dome and other defense systems, heralding in a "new era of warfare", the Israeli defence ministry said.</p>

<p>Costing Israel over $500 million, the Iron Beam will engage and neutralise missiles, drones, rockets and mortars at a time the country is at war with the Hamas in Palestine and Hezbollah in Iran. Retaliatory strikes between the three countries have caused widespread destruction, recently hitting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's residence in the coastal city of Caesarea.</p>

<p>Developed by Rafael Advanced Defense Systems, architect of Israel's Iron Dome, and Elbit Systems, the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.rafael.co.il/system/iron-beam/">Iron Beam</a> can engage at the speed of light from a range of hundreds of meters to several kilometers. It has an unlimited magazine, almost zero cost per interception and causes minimal collateral damage.</p>

<p>Israel's defence ministry said that the Iron Beam will shoot down the smaller projectiles, while larger targets like ballistic missiles will be tackled by the Arrow 2 and Arrow 3 interceptors. The system will heat and destroy the target, including drones, which are small, light and have a low radar signature, making them tough targets for the Iron Dome, experts told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/01/middleeast/israel-iron-beam-laser-system-intl/index.html"><em>CNN</em></a>.</p>

<p>Further, the system will function at a fraction of the cost that goes into operating the Iron Dome. Tel Aviv think tank Institute for National Security Studies said each interceptor missile fired by the Iron Dome costs approximately $50,000.</p>

<p>The system, however, does not operate well in low visibility conditions, including inclement weather.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the United States said it will deploy B-52 bombers, fighter jets, refueling aircraft and Navy destroyers to the Middle East, in a readjustment of military assets as the Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group prepares to leave the region. The latest adjustment in US forces in the region follows direct exchanges of fire in October between Israel and Iran.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Since late September Israel has been fighting a two-front war, against Iran-backed Hezbollah in Lebanon and against Hamas, which triggered the Gaza war by attacking Israel on October 7 last year. Hamas's October 7, 2023 attack resulted in the deaths of 1,206 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures. Israel's retaliatory military campaign has killed 43,259 people in Gaza, most of them civilians, according to figures from the Hamas-run territory's health ministry which the United Nations considers reliable.</p>

<p>US, Egyptian and Qatari mediators have tried for months to broker a truce and hostages for prisoners exchange for Gaza.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rescuers raised the death toll in Spain's worst floods for a generation to 205 on Friday and fears grew for the dozens missing as hopes of finding survivors faded.</p>

<p>The floods that have tossed vehicles, collapsed bridges and covered towns with mud since Tuesday are the European country's deadliest such disaster in decades.</p>

<p>The organisation coordinating emergency services in the hardest-hit eastern Valencia region said 202 people had been confirmed dead there.</p>

<p>Officials in neighbouring Castilla-La Mancha and Andalusia in the south had already announced a combined three deaths in their regions.</p>

<p>Rescuers equipped with helicopters, drones and sniffer dogs waded through water and rummaged through debris in search of dozens of people the authorities believe are still missing.</p>

<p>The government has deployed another 500 troops to the stricken areas to bolster the 1,200 already on site for search, rescue and logistics tasks. Another 500 will be dispatched on Saturday.</p>

<p>The Civil Guard alone had rescued more than 4,500 people as of Friday afternoon, Interior Minister Fernando Grande-Marlaska said.</p>

<p>But three days on from the disaster, hopes of finding more survivors are dwindling.</p>

<p>The courthouse in Valencia city has been converted into a morgue, where health workers wearing smocks carried stretchers covered with white sheets.</p>

<h3><strong>&nbsp;'People are desperate'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Some cut-off areas went without water, food or power for days after the floods began, and many roads and railways remain inaccessible.</p>

<p>Engineers worked to remove abandoned cars strewn over warped railway tracks and slabs of tarmac from destroyed roads littered inundated fields, AFP journalists saw.</p>

<p>French volunteers also announced their staff had arrived in Spain on Friday bringing equipment to help clear debris, pump water and rescue victims.</p>

<p>In the devastated town of Paiporta near Valencia city, some residents complained aid was coming too slowly and frustrating the efforts of volunteers.</p>

<p>"There aren't enough firefighters, the shovels haven't arrived," Paco Clemente, a 33-year-old pharmacist, told AFP as he helped clear mud from a friend's house.</p>

<p>Thousands of people remain cut off from the electricity and telephone networks, but it is hoped the estimated number of missing people will fall once connections are restored.</p>

<p>With several places seeing signs of order breaking down, government minister Angel Victor Torres on Thursday vowed an uncompromising response to looting.</p>

<p>Police said they had arrested 50 people for incidents including theft from vehicles and a jewellery store.</p>

<p>In the Valencia region town of Aldaia, Fernando Lozano told AFP he saw thieves grabbing items from an abandoned supermarket as "people are a bit desperate".</p>

<p>"Until things return to normal and the supermarket opens, it's going to be very bad here."</p>

<p>Sports centres and schools were among the sites being used for emergency food distribution, Valencia region leader Carlos Mazon told reporters.</p>

<p>- Wave of solidarity -</p>

<p>An army of thousands of volunteers set off from Valencia on Friday armed with shovels, buckets and shopping trolleys laden with food and nappies to help distressed neighbours in the city's flooded suburbs.</p>

<p>Among them was Federico Martinez, a 55-year-old engineer who headed to help Paiporta residents clear their town of mud.</p>

<p>"We took what we had at home, and now it's time to help. It's emotional, it gives you goosebumps," he told AFP.</p>

<p>Helpers also flocked to Valencia football club's Mestalla stadium where volunteers formed human chains to collect mountains of essential supplies.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez hailed "the limitless solidarity and dedication of Spanish society" on X and pledged aid "for as long as it takes".</p>

<p>But the Valencia regional government urged people to stay at home, saying they risked holding up the emergency services rushing to the worst-affected areas.</p>

<p>Pope Francis expressed his solidarity with the victims and their families in Spain, historically a deeply Catholic country.</p>

<p>Sanchez will on Saturday chair another meeting of a special committee made up of top cabinet ministers to follow the crisis.</p>

<p>Marlaska has been sent to Valencia to facilitate the cooperation between the central government and regional authorities in Spain's highly decentralised state.</p>

<p>The storm that sparked the floods formed as cold air moved over the warm waters of the Mediterranean and is common for the time of year.</p>

<p>But scientists warn climate change driven by human activity is increasing the ferocity, length and frequency of such extreme weather events.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United States announced Friday the deployment of additional military assets to the Middle East, including ballistic missile defense destroyers and long-range B-52 bomber aircraft, serving as a warning to Iran as it and Israel trade tit-for-tat strikes.</p>

<p>"Should Iran, its partners, or its proxies use this moment to target American personnel or interests in the region, the United States will take every measure necessary to defend our people," Pentagon spokesman Major General Pat Ryder said in a statement.</p>

<p>The additional resources build on previous US defense deployments to the Middle East in support of Israel, including a THAAD missile defense system deployed to the country late last month, operated by American troops on the ground.</p>

<p>The new forces "will begin to arrive in coming months," Ryder said.</p>

<p>Israel launched significant strikes against Iran on October 26, devastating military infrastructure to the Islamic republic while steering clear of critical nuclear and oil sites.</p>

<p>Iran has carried out two major attacks against Israel in 2024 -- one in April after a strike on its consulate in Damascus that was blamed on Israel, and another in October that Tehran said was in response to the assassination of leaders of armed groups it backs in the Middle East.</p>

<p>Observers warn the continued military operations between the regional rivals could escalate further.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[US Vice President Kamala Harris lambasted Donald Trump on Friday for her White House rival's "violent rhetoric," saying his recent verbal attack on a Republican critic should disqualify him from becoming president again.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump came under fire for violent rhetoric against a prominent Kamala Harris supporter Friday as the candidates hold dueling rallies in battleground Wisconsin four days before the climax of the most volatile US presidential campaign in modern history.</p>

<p>More than 68 million Americans have already cast early ballots ahead of Election Day on Tuesday. Opinion polls show Trump and Harris running dead even, with victory depending on who prevails across the seven swing states, including Wisconsin.</p>

<p>Both were campaigning in the state's largest city Milwaukee.</p>

<p>Trump was holding a rally in the same venue where he celebrated the Republican Party nomination over the summer and delivered a triumphant acceptance speech just days after the 78-year-old had narrowly escaped an assassination attempt in Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>Harris -- who only entered the race in July after President Joe Biden dropped out amid fears over his declining mental acuity -- was to be joined by star rapper Cardi B in the latest of a series of high-energy rallies.</p>

<p>But before the big campaign events, Harris lambasted Trump for using "violent rhetoric" when discussing one of his chief critics in the Republican Party.</p>

<p>Trump has "suggested rifles should be trained on former representative Liz Cheney," Harris told reporters in Madison, Wisconsin.</p>

<p>"This must be disqualifying. Anyone who wants to be president of the United States who uses that kind of violent rhetoric is clearly disqualified and unqualified to be president."</p>

<p><strong>- Guns 'trained on her face' -</strong><br />
As the contest draws to a close, Trump has upped his provocative rhetoric in a bid to fire up a base he needs to turn out in massive numbers.</p>

<p>Wisconsin is part of the Democrats' "blue wall" across the Midwest, but the region could go either way -- and with it the presidency.</p>

<p>The other path to victory could run through southern and western "Sun Belt" swing states, where Trump and Harris both campaigned Thursday.</p>

<p>At an Arizona event Thursday with rightwing influencer Tucker Carlson, Trump called Harris, 60, a "sleaze bag" and Biden a "stupid bastard."</p>

<p>He also claimed, without evidence, that polls are already being rigged in the biggest swing state Pennsylvania -- reinforcing expectations that, as in 2020, he will refuse to accept the results if he is defeated.</p>

<p>But it was his comments about Cheney, once a senior Republican leader who has become a supporter of Harris, that stirred most controversy.</p>

<p>Citing her hawkish foreign policy views, Trump conjured the image of Cheney -- daughter of former Republican vice president Dick Cheney -- being shot.</p>

<p>"She's a radical war hawk. Let's put her with a rifle standing there with nine barrels shooting at her, OK? Let's see how she feels about it, you know, when the guns are trained on her face," Trump said.</p>

<p>Cheney responded, saying, "This is how dictators destroy free nations. They threaten those who speak against them with death."</p>

<p>Harris rushed to her defense, and warned that Trump is "someone who considers his political opponents the enemy, is permanently out for revenge and is increasingly unstable and unhinged."</p>

<p>Adding to tensions, social media is awash with disinformation that authorities say has been stirred by Russian operatives and amplified by US right-wing influencers -- including Trump ally Elon Musk, the world's richest man and owner of the X platform.</p>

<p>Much of Musk's effort has involved pushing lies about non-citizen immigrants voting.</p>

<p>Trump notably made a stop Friday in Dearborn, Michigan, the country's largest Arab-American city, where outrage over Israel's war in Gaza has alienated many Muslims from the Democratic Party -- something Trump is hoping to exploit.</p>

<p>After meeting supporters at an upscale halal restaurant, Trump confirmed to reporters that vaccine skeptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr would play a "big role" in health care if Trump were elected.</p>

<p><strong>- Jobs surprise -</strong><br />
Harris is running on warnings about an authoritarian Trump takeover, promising to help the middle class, and pushing back against Republican abortion curbs.</p>

<p>Trump has focused his campaign on stirring fears about immigrant violence and pessimism over the economy.</p>

<p>Economists say the US economy is actually in robust shape, shrugging off the last Covid pandemic cobwebs, with low unemployment and strong growth.</p>

<p>The Wall Street Journal, a major daily closely read by many conservatives, offered a very positive assessment Thursday, saying "the next president inherits a remarkable economy."</p>

<p>Figures released Friday though showed much lower job growth in October, denting Democratic messaging. Economists said the job slowdown was a blip, caused by knock-on effects from hurricanes and a strike at Boeing.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A U.S. judge on Friday denied Elon Musk's bid to move a Pennsylvania lawsuit over his $1 million voter prizes to federal court, moving the case back to state court.</p>

<p>It was not immediately clear if the decision would affect the billionaire's plan to keep awarding money until the U.S. presidential election on Tuesday.</p>

<p>The decision was issued by U.S. District Judge Gerald Pappert in Philadelphia federal court.</p>

<p>Musk has been giving $1 million checks to randomly selected registered voters who sign a petition supporting free speech and gun rights.</p>

<p>Musk's America PAC had awarded $1 million prizes to 14 people as of Friday and said the final prize will be given on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Democratic Philadelphia District Attorney Lawrence Krasner sued Musk and his political action committee, which backs Republican former President Donald Trump, on Oct. 28 in a state court to try to block the giveaway. Krasner called the program an illegal lottery.</p>

<p>Two days later, Tesla CEO Musk and his America PAC sought to move it to federal court, arguing Krasner's lawsuit raised questions about free-speech rights and election interference that belong in federal court. That prompted the state judge who had been overseeing the case to put it on hold.</p>

<p>In arguing that the case belonged in state court, Krasner called Musk's maneuver an attempt to "run the clock until Election Day." Krasner did not allege the giveaway violates federal law.</p>

<p>Philadelphia is the largest city in Pennsylvania, one of seven battleground states likely to determine the outcome of the race between Trump and his Democratic opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris.</p>

<p>Musk's offer is limited to registered voters in the seven states expected to decide the election - Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.</p>

<p>Musk gave away the first $1 million at an Oct. 19 America PAC rally in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania's state capital.</p>

<p>The giveaway falls in a gray area of election law, and legal experts are divided on whether Musk could be violating federal laws against paying people to register to vote.</p>

<p>The U.S. Department of Justice warned America PAC the giveaway could violate federal law, according to media reports, but federal prosecutors have not taken any public action.</p>

<p>Musk has so far given nearly $120 million to America PAC, according to federal disclosures.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For the past year, the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah and Israel have engaged in exchanges of fire alongside the ongoing conflict in Gaza. However, recent weeks have seen a significant escalation in hostilities. The continuous heavy shelling and artillery battles have severely disrupted medical facilities in the region.</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/25/world/middleeast/gaza-war-cancer-jordan.html#:~:text=Laura%20Boushnak%20spent%20time%20with,after%20their%20evacuation%20from%20Gaza.&amp;text=The%20skies%20were%20quiet%20and,old%20was%20unable%20to%20sleep."><em>The New York Times</em></a>, more than 10,000 cancer patients still require immediate assistance, even though more than 4,000 patients have fled Gaza for medical treatment since the start of the conflict.</p>

<p>While undergoing therapy in Jordan, patients struggle with emotions of guilt and homesickness. Mohammed, a patient who was given a Hodgkin lymphoma diagnosis in January 2023, went with his mother, Maha, who insisted on taking the family with them.</p>

<p>At the King Hussein Cancer Centre in Amman, the number of patients from Gaza has increased significantly. Patients live in a hotel nearby, fostering a sense of community. However, uncertainty looms over their futures as many fear returning to a devastated Gaza.</p>

<p>Hussam Shehadeh, another patient, reflects on his separation from his family in Gaza, expressing worries about their safety and his own health. Similarly, 13-year-old Mohammed Abdel Hadi faces emotional challenges after leaving his family behind. He locked himself in his room until a call from his mother persuaded him to continue treatment. As patients navigate their illnesses and the trauma of conflict, many hope to return to Gaza once the war ends, according to an <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/25/world/middleeast/gaza-war-cancer-jordan.html#:~:text=Laura%20Boushnak%20spent%20time%20with,after%20their%20evacuation%20from%20Gaza.&amp;text=The%20skies%20were%20quiet%20and,old%20was%20unable%20to%20sleep."><em>NYT report.</em></a></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A woman in Xinxiang, Henan province, recently uncovered that she is not biologically related to her parents after a DNA test, prompted by her coworkers' comments on her unique appearance.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In an unexpected turn of events, a woman in northern China recently had a DNA test and found she was not genetically related to her parents, according to <em>South China Morning Post. </em>In an interview, the woman from Xinxiang, Henan province, with the last name Dong, disclosed that the test was triggered by her coworkers' light-hearted remarks about her unusual looks, stating that it "did not look local." Inspired by their comments, she began to wonder where she came from and sought clarification from her parents.</p>

<p>Dong asked her family members about her origins, and they gave vague, contradictory answers, including different dates of birth, as per the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scmp.com/news/people-culture/trending-china/article/3284479/chinese-woman-takes-dna-test-after-joke-about-her-looks-finds-out-true-identity"><em>news portal.</em></a> Her interest was piqued by her parents' uncertainty, which is why she sought confirmation via a DNA test. Her suspicions were validated by the test results, which showed that she was not her parents' biological daughter.</p>

<p>"I've always lived in Xinxiang, but after I started working, my colleagues would say, 'You do not look like us at all. Your nose is wide, you have thick lips, and your eyes are bigger and deeper than ours. You do not look like someone from Henan at all,'" Dong told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scmp.com/news/people-culture/trending-china/article/3284479/chinese-woman-takes-dna-test-after-joke-about-her-looks-finds-out-true-identity"><em>SCMP.</em></a></p>

<p>"Every night, I kept wondering, where do I really come from?" Dong reflected.</p>

<p>China's internet community has exploded with support since this announcement, with many urging Dong to look for her biological parents. Since its initial coverage by Henan Broadcasting System on October 24, the story has generated a lot of interest and conversations on social media.</p>

<p>However, the test indicated that she likely originated from Guangxi province, located in the far southern part of China, showing no genetic connections to Henan province.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[With just four days left until Election Day, Donald Trump's baseless claims of voter fraud in Pennsylvania have raised concerns that he may attempt to overturn the vote, not just in Pennsylvania but also in other crucial battleground states.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With just four days left until Election Day, former President Donald Trump's baseless claims of voter fraud in Pennsylvania have raised concerns that he may attempt to overturn the vote, not just in Pennsylvania but also in other crucial battleground states.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Trump's rhetoric has sparked fears of violence and attempts to disrupt the electoral process, similar to the January 6, 2021, US Capitol attack.</p>

<p>Trump's claims have raised concerns that he is preparing to blame a potential loss in Pennsylvania on voter fraud. His social media post on Thursday stated, "We caught them CHEATING BIG in Pennsylvania," and demanded criminal prosecutions. A senior Harris campaign official countered that Trump's claims are an attempt to "sow doubt in our elections and institutions when he's afraid he can't win."</p>

<p>Kyle Miller, a Pennsylvania policy strategist, warns that Trump's actions are "sowing the seeds for attempts to overturn an election result that cuts against Donald Trump." Miller believes that Trump and his allies have learned from their 2020 experience, realizing they need to spread these ideas early.</p>

<p>Trump recently intensified his unfounded allegations, claiming probes into suspect voter registration forms are proof of voter fraud. However, state officials and democracy advocates argue that these incidents demonstrate the system working as intended.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A judge extended the mail-in ballot deadline in Bucks County after Trump's campaign sued, and investigations into potentially fraudulent registrations in Lancaster and York counties have found no evidence of illegal voting.</p>

<p>The US electoral system, rooted in the 1789 Constitution, provides opportunities for Trump and his supporters to challenge or delay election results. In 2020, Trump's team attempted 60 court cases alleging fraud, all unsuccessful. However, this experience has prepared lawyers on both sides for another potential dispute.</p>

<p>Should Trump's followers manage to overturn or delay unfavourable state results through the courts or legislative obstruction, they could potentially prevent a duly elected Harris from taking office and sway the result in Trump's favor. Some states have warned local officials not to intervene illegally or refuse to certify results. Ultimately, the nine-member US Supreme Court, with six conservative justices, three appointed by Trump, would be the final arbiter in such a case.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Indian Ocean island of Mauritius blocked access to social media on Friday, just days ahead of a general election, as tensions mounted over a wire-tapping scandal.</p>

<p>Mauritius has been gripped by the release of secret recordings of phone calls by politicians, journalists, members of civil society and even foreign diplomats that began to emerge online last month.</p>

<p>On Friday, the office of Prime Minister Pravind Kumar Jugnauth said it had ordered internet service providers to block access to the most widely used social networks.</p>

<p>The blockage is due to last until November 11 -- the day after the election -- according to telecoms operator EMTEL.</p>

<p>"Following the publication of certain audio tracks on social media, there is a real risk that the national security and integrity of our Republic and our international partners may have been compromised," the prime minister's office said in a statement.</p>

<p>NetBlocks, an internet governance watchdog, confirmed that Facebook, Instagram, TikTok and X were not accessible.</p>

<p>The former CEO of Mauritius Telecom, Sherry Singh, was arrested later on Friday along with three other suspects as part of the investigation into the leaks, police sources told AFP. Details of the charges were not immediately available.</p>

<p>The leaked recordings were released by an account called Missie Moustass (Mr Moustache), primarily on TikTok.</p>

<p>There have been attempts to block the account but it quickly resurfaced elsewhere and has been releasing recordings almost daily.</p>

<p>Among those causing the greatest shock was that of the police commissioner apparently asking a forensic doctor to alter a report into a person who died after being beaten in police custody. A judicial investigation into the death was launched following the leak.</p>

<p>Private calls featuring British High Commissioner Charlotte Pierre also appear to have been leaked.</p>

<p>The shock ban on social media was roundly condemned by the opposition and poses a major challenge for local media and political parties which rely heavily on Facebook and other online outlets.</p>

<p>"It's shocking, revolting and unacceptable. It's a sign of panic," said Paul Berenger, one of the leaders of the opposition Alliance for Change coalition.</p>

<p>"We are dealing with people who are dangerous to the country. Lawyers are working on what can be done legally. We will move very quickly on the legal and political level," he added.</p>

<p>Jugnauth is seeking re-election as head of the Militant Socialist Movement.</p>

<p>He inherited the premiership on the death of his father in 2017 and secured a victory for his coalition in polls two years later.</p>

<p>"This is the last desperate act of a regime in disarray," said Nando Bodha, head of opposition grouping Linion Reform.</p>

<p>"It attacks head-on the fundamental rights of citizens guaranteed by the constitution, including freedom of expression," he added, calling for an intervention by the Election Commission to ensure the polls are "free and fair".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nine immigrants from various countries, including Lebanon, Germany, Taiwan, and Mexico, took the oath to become American citizens in a scenic outdoor naturalisation ceremony overlooking Los Angeles, with the iconic Hollywood sign as their backdrop.</p>

<p>As the US presidential election draws near, many of these new citizens are eager to exercise their right to vote, with some already knowing who they'll support.</p>

<p>Chia Hsin Tsai, a 33-year-old marketing manager from Taiwan, is one of them. She's lived in the US for 11 years and applied for citizenship in March. "Becoming a part of the country that I'm living in makes me feel special," she said, though she didn't disclose who she'll vote for.</p>

<p>Floriane Turcat, a 37-year-old French actress, was inspired by American movies and TV shows. She's now registered to vote in California and plans to support Vice President Kamala Harris, citing concerns for women's rights and reproductive rights. She said, “I want to be part of the political movement of this country,” and added, “Even though California is a Democratic state, I want to be able to participate and have a voice and state that it's important for me. I want to stand for my rights.”</p>

<p>Phoenix De Los Angeles Lopez Daal, a 31-year-old set dresser from Venezuela, hopes to vote for former President Donald Trump. He is of the opinion that there should be freedom of speech, freedom of religion and the right to own and carry arms.</p>

<p>Dennis Beier, a 46-year-old German film producer, wants to vote for Harris to protect democracy, especially after the January 6 US Capitol attack. Beier has always seen the US as a land of freedom and opportunity. “I just want to keep like this whole democracy thing intact,” Beier stated. “And people need to respect when they lose, that's part of it, and if you can't, then you should not be in politics.”</p>

<p>The US presidential election is heating up, with just days to go until November 5th. Harris and Trump are neck and neck in a fiercely contested battle for the White House.&nbsp;These individuals, along with tens of millions of other Americans, will shape the country's future with their votes.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iran's leadership and allies are bracing for what they would regard as a dreadful outcome of the imminent US presidential election: A return to power of Donald Trump.</p>

<p>Opinion polls suggest the Republican Trump and Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris remain locked in a close contest. But Iranian leaders and their regional allies in Lebanon, Iraq, and Yemen are concerned that Trump could well triumph on November 5 and this could spell more trouble for them.</p>

<p>Iran's main concern is the potential for Trump to empower Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to strike Iran's nuclear sites, conduct targeted assassinations and reimpose his "maximum pressure policy" through heightened sanctions on their oil industry, according to Iranian, Arab and Western officials.</p>

<p>They anticipate that Trump, who was president in 2017-21, will exert utmost pressure on Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to cave in by accepting a nuclear containment deal on terms set by himself and Israel.</p>

<p>This potential change in US leadership could have far-reaching implications for the Middle East balance of power, and might reshape Iran's foreign policy and economic prospects.</p>

<p>Analysts argue that whether the next US administration is led by Harris or Trump, Iran will lack the leverage it once held - largely due to Israel's year-old military campaign aimed at degrading the Islamic Republic's armed proxies, including Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon.</p>

<p>However, Trump's stance is perceived as more detrimental to Iran due to his more automatic support for Israel, they added.</p>

<p>"Trump will either put very tough conditions on Iran or let Israel carry out targeted strikes on its nuclear facilities. He is fully endorsing a military action against Iran," Abdelaziz al-Sagher, head of the Gulf Research Center think-tank, said.</p>

<p>"It's Netanyahu's dream day to have Trump back in the White House," he told Reuters.</p>

<p><strong>POISON CHALICE?</strong></p>

<p>A senior Iranian official who declined to be named told Reuters Tehran was "prepared for all scenarios. We have (for decades) consistently found ways to export oil, bypassing harsh US sanctions..., and have strengthened our ties with the rest of the world no matter who was in the White House."</p>

<p>But another Iranian official said a Trump victory would be "a nightmare. He will raise pressure on Iran to please Israel..., make sure oil sanctions are fully enforced. If so, (our) establishment will be economically paralysed."</p>

<p>In an election speech in October, Trump stated his unwillingness to go to war with Iran, but said Israel should "hit the Iranian nuclear first and worry about the rest later", in response to Iran's missile attack on Israel on October 1.</p>

<p>Israel retaliated with airstrikes on Iranian military targets, especially missile production sites, on October 26.</p>

<p>Iran's choices are limited going forward, analysts say.</p>

<p>"The reality is: Trump is going to support Netanyahu and give him the green light to do whatever he wants," said Hassan Hassan, an author and researcher on Islamic groups. "Trump is much worse (than Harris) for Iran."</p>

<p>Hassan noted that Washington has delegated a substantial share of responsibility to Israel in the conflict with Iran and its proxies, with Israel leading the way. "The US is involved enough in that it's backing Israel, may be more so than before.</p>

<p>"This time it's just things are really bad for Iran. Iran is seen as a problem by both Republicans and Democrats."</p>

<p>During her campaign, Harris called Iran a "dangerous" and "destabilising" force in the Middle East and said the US was committed to Israel's security. She said the US would work with allies to disrupt Iran's "aggressive behaviour".</p>

<p>But Trump's re-election would be a "poisoned chalice", for Khamenei, according to two regional officials.</p>

<p>If he were to reinstate stringent sanctions, Khamenei may be forced to negotiate and accept a nuclear pact more favourable to US and Israeli term to preserve theocratic rule in Iran, which is facing growing foreign pressure and has been buffeted by bouts of mass protest at home in recent years.</p>

<p>A US-Saudi defence pact tied to Riyadh's establishing diplomatic relations with Israel, now in its final negotiating stages, poses a significant challenge to Khamenei too.</p>

<p>This alliance threatens to shift the regional balance of power by creating a more unified front against Iran, impacting its geopolitical standing and strategy in the Middle East.</p>

<p><strong>NEW ARCHITECTURE</strong></p>

<p>Hassan said recent attacks on Iran and its allies have been widely perceived as a significant success for Israel. They offered insights into what a limited strike on Iran might look like, setting a precedent and altering assumptions that military action on Iran would inevitably spark a wider Middle East war.</p>

<p>A senior Arab security official said that Tehran could "no longer brandish its influence through its armed proxies" in the wake of Israel's deadly strikes on Hezbollah and Hamas leaders.</p>

<p>For its own part, Iran has every reason to fear another Trump term.</p>

<p>It was Trump who in 2018 unilaterally pulled the US out of Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers and ordered the killing of Qassem Soleimani, Khamenei's right-hand man and mastermind of overseas attacks on US and allied interests.</p>

<p>Trump also imposed punitive sanctions targeting Iran's oil export revenues and international banking transactions, which led to extreme economic hardship and exacerbated public discontent in the Islamic Republic.</p>

<p>He frequently said during his presidential campaign that President Joe Biden's policy of not rigorously enforcing oil export sanctions has weakened Washington and emboldened Tehran, allowing it to sell oil, accumulate cash and expand its nuclear pursuits and influence through armed militias.</p>

<p>In March, he told Israel's Hayom newspaper in an interview that Iran could have a nuclear weapon in 35 days and that Israel - which deems Iran's nuclear activity an existential threat though is widely thought to have the region's only nuclear arms - was in a "very treacherous and dangerous neighbourhood".</p>

<p>An Arab government adviser noted that Tehran recognises there is a "new architecture in the making", but also that Trump despite his tough rhetoric realises there is no alternative to a deal with Iran given its accelerated uranium enrichment program.</p>

<p>"Trump might aim for a new nuclear agreement, he could say I tore up the 2015 agreement because it was incomplete and replace it with a long-lasting agreement, touting it to 'make America great again' and preserve US interests," the adviser said.</p>

<p>As the 2015 deal has eroded over the years, Iran has escalated the level of fissile purity in enriched uranium, cutting the time it would need to build an atom bomb if it chose to, though it denies wanting to.</p>

<p>Iran Online, a state-run news website, stated that when Trump left office, Iran was capping enrichment at 3.67 percent under the deal, far below the 90 percent of weapons grade.</p>

<p>Now, Iran has "enriched uranium to 60% with IR-6 advanced centrifuges" and could achieve nuclear weapons capability "within a few weeks ... Completing the nuclear deterrence cycle is Iran's greatest trump card against Trump," it said.</p>

<p>Arab and Western officials warn that the more Iran hints it is nearing development of an atom bomb, the more they incite the need for Israel to strike.</p>

<p>"If Trump reassumes power, he will support Israeli plans to strike Iranian nuclear facilities," a Western official said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Thai YouTuber Natthamon Khongchak, also known as "Nutty," was arrested and extradited to Thailand with her mother, Thaniya, following two years on the run in Indonesia.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After two years of eluding authorities in Indonesia, Thai YouTuber Natthamon Khongchak, also known as "Nutty," was extradited to Thailand. On October 25, the 31-year-old and her mother, Thaniya, were taken into custody and sent back to Thailand.</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/general/2890133/former-youtube-star-back-in-thailand-to-face-fraud-charges"><em>The Bangkok Post,</em></a> Wissanu Chimtrakul, deputy director general of Thailand's Department of Special Investigation (DSI), made the arrest in response to claims that Khongchak and her mother planned a scam that defrauded more than 6,000 people out of about 2 billion baht (US$59 million).</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/feature/gidan-badamasi-hit-nigerian-tv-show-raises-awareness-on-family-size-and-population-challenges-in-africa-6921443"><strong>Also Read | Hit Nigerian TV Show Raises Awareness On Population Challenges In Africa&nbsp;</strong></a></p>

<p>Khongchak, who previously gained popularity with over 800,000 YouTube followers, initially built her platform by posting singing and dancing videos, covering well-known K-pop groups such as Blackpink and BTS. She later attempted to become a K-pop idol in South Korea, briefly debuting under the label Dream Cinema, according to the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scmp.com/news/people-culture/article/3284286/thai-con-woman-arrested-unable-sing-indonesian-national-anthem-while-posing-local"><em>South China Morning Post.</em></a></p>

<p>In recent years, Khongchak shifted her focus, portraying herself as a skilled investor and forex trader. She claimed her family was highly affluent, with assets including 14 cars and a team of 22 nannies, as she shared on a Thai television program. However, her bid to pass as a local in Indonesia faltered when she failed to sing the national anthem, ultimately leading to her arrest.</p>

<p>She reportedly attempted to apply for an Indonesian passport to travel overseas, but immigration officials detected her foreign accent and asked her to sing the Indonesian national anthem and recite the country's constitution. When she failed to do so, her true identity was revealed.</p>]]></content:encoded>

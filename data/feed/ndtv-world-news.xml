       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>McDonald's worked Wednesday to reassure customers that its US restaurants are safe as federal investigators tried to pinpoint the cause of a deadly E coli outbreak linked to fast-food giant's Quarter Pounder hamburgers.</p>

<p>McDonald's pulled Quarter Pounders from one-fifth of its US stores Tuesday as a result of the outbreak, which the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention said had sickened at least 49 people in 10 states. One person died and 10 were hospitalized, according to the CDC.</p>

<p>A preliminary investigation by the US Food and Drug Administration suggested fresh slivered onions that are served raw on Quarter Pounder hamburgers were a likely source of the contamination.</p>

<p>McDonald's said it was searching for a new regional supplier for fresh onions. In the meantime, Quarter Pounders were removed from menus in the impacted states as well as portions of other states.</p>

<p>McDonald's said it has worked closely with federal food safety regulators since late last week, when it was alerted to the potential outbreak. The company said the scope of the problem and the popularity of its products have complicated efforts to identify the contamination source.</p>

<p>McDonald's has more than 14,000 US stores and serves 1 million Quarter Pounders every two weeks in the affected area.</p>

<p>McDonald's is known for its stringent food safety guidelines and protocols, said Chris Gaulke, a professor of food and beverage management at Cornell University's Nolan School of Hotel Administration. The company said Wednesday that the supplier regularly tested its onions for E coli, for example.</p>

<p>"Given the volume of food that they go through, how infrequently this happens to McDonald's is a testament to the effort that they take," Gaulke said.</p>

<p>But some experts questioned why McDonald's simply stopped selling one sandwich and didn't close restaurants for further investigation.</p>

<p>"Good practice would have been to close all the restaurants," Bill Marler, a Seattle lawyer who specialises in food safety cases, said. "Until we know definitively what the product was that made people sick, consumers should be aware." Marler said cross-contamination remains a potential possibility at the affected restaurants until they are thoroughly cleaned.</p>

<p>Asked why it didn't close any stores, McDonald's said nothing in the government's investigation indicated there were issues with its food preparation practices. In an interview on the "Today" show Wednesday, McDonald's US President Joe Erlinger also said it's likely that whatever product was contaminated has already passed through the company's supply chain.</p>

<p>The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention reported the outbreak late Tuesday. It said infections were reported between Sept. 27 and October 11 in Colorado, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Oregon, Utah, Wisconsin and Wyoming.</p>

<p>State and local public health officials were interviewing people about the foods they ate in the week before they got sick. Of the 18 people interviewed as of Tuesday, all reported eating at McDonald's, and 16 people reported eating a beef hamburger. Twelve reported eating a Quarter Pounder.</p>

<p>McDonald's said it's unlikely the beef in the Quarter Pounder was the source, since it comes from multiple suppliers and is cooked at a high enough temperature to kill E coli.</p>

<p>McDonald's said its initial findings suggest that some of the reported illnesses were linked to onions from a single supplier, which the company didn't name. McDonald's said the onions are cleaned and sliced by the supplier and then packaged for use on individual Quarter Pounders.</p>

<p>The incubation period for E coli is only a couple of days, so illness would be quickly apparent to anyone affected, said Donald Schaffner, a food safety expert at Rutgers University. "If you ate these burgers in September and now it's the middle of October and you didn't get sick, you're probably OK," he said.</p>

<p>E coli bacteria are harbored in the guts of animals and found in the environment. Infections can cause severe illness, including fever, stomach cramps and bloody diarrhea. People who develop symptoms of E. coli poisoning should seek health care immediately and tell the provider what they ate.</p>

<p>The type of bacteria implicated in the McDonald's food causes about 74,000 infections in the U.S. annually, leading to more than 2,000 hospitalisations and 61 deaths each year, according to the CDC. In general, E. coli infections were lower in 2023 than in recent years and cases of severe kidney injury caused by the bacteria remained stable, according to latest federal data.</p>

<p>Outbreaks at restaurant chains are rare, but they do happen. AP MNK MNK</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At least 3,000 North Korean soldiers have been sent to Russia and are training there, the United States said Wednesday, warning that they would become legitimate targets for Kyiv if they engage in combat in Ukraine.</p>

<p>Russia and North Korea have boosted their political and military alliance amid the Ukraine war, with Pyongyang facing long-standing accusations of supplying arms to Moscow's army.</p>

<p>But the deployment of troops to support Russian forces would be a significant escalation in that support and has prompted warnings from Kyiv and its Western backers, who separately said Wednesday that they would make $50 billion in lending available to aid Ukraine.</p>

<p>"We assess that between early to mid-October, North Korea moved at least 3,000 soldiers into eastern Russia," US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told journalists.</p>

<p>The troops traveled by ship from North Korea to Vladivostok, and then went to "multiple Russian military training sites in eastern Russia, where they are currently undergoing training," Kirby said.</p>

<p>"We do not yet know whether these soldiers will enter into combat alongside the Russian military," but "if these North Korean soldiers decide to join the fight against Ukraine, they will become legitimate military targets," he said.</p>

<p>North Korea's state media has not commented since Seoul's spy agency said last week said Pyongyang had decided to send a "large-scale" troop deployment to Russia to fight Ukraine.</p>

<p>Moscow on Wednesday refused to confirm or deny the reports, with&nbsp; foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova telling reporters to "ask Pyongyang" where its troops are.</p>

<p><strong>- International concerns -</strong></p>

<p>After a briefing by the National Intelligence Service, South Korean lawmaker Park Sun-won said earlier that 1,500 more troops had been sent to Russia, taking the total deployment to 3,000.</p>

<p>Seoul says Pyongyang plans to deploy 10,000 soldiers to Russia by December, with international concerns escalating.</p>

<p>Germany said Wednesday it had summoned North Korea's envoy to warn the reclusive state against sending troops.</p>

<p>"North Korea's support of the Russian war of aggression directly threatens Germany's security and the European peace order," the German foreign ministry said on social media platform X.</p>

<p>Kyiv on Wednesday called on any North Korean troops deployed by Russia to lay down their arms and save their lives.</p>

<p>"We address fighters of the Korean People's Army who were sent to help Putin's regime. You must not die senselessly in a foreign land," said a statement issued by a group run by Kyiv's military intelligence.</p>

<p>"You must not repeat the fate of hundreds of thousands of Russian soldiers who will never return home!" it added.</p>

<p><strong>- 'Helping Putin' -</strong></p>

<p>South Korea has said the nuclear-armed North is supplying Russia with weapons for use in Ukraine. The fresh alarm comes after the North's leader Kim Jong Un and Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a military deal in June.</p>

<p>South Korea will send a delegation to NATO headquarters in Brussels next week to brief the alliance on the situation, officials said.</p>

<p>Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has pleaded for Kyiv's allies to respond and repeatedly said a North Korean deployment risks further escalating and prolonging the war.</p>

<p>"It is important that our partners do not hide from this challenge. All partners," he said in an address published late Tuesday.</p>

<p>"And if Russia is still able to make this war bigger and longer, then everyone in the world who is not helping to force Russia to peace is actually helping Putin to fight," he added.</p>

<p>Experts have said that in return for the troops, North Korea is likely aiming to acquire military technology, ranging from surveillance satellites to submarines, plus possible security guarantees from Moscow.</p>

<p>North Korea and Russia are under UN sanctions -- Kim for his nuclear weapons program, and Moscow for the Ukraine war.</p>

<p>Kyiv meanwhile obtained significant new international financial backing on Wednesday in the form of $50 billion in lending that US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said G7 nations are committed to making available this year using profits from the interest on frozen Russian assets.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[PM Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping held their first "formal bilateral meeting" since the military stand-off between India and China began in 2020. Here is an explainer with video, a map, and satellite images to help understand the LAC.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping held a bilateral meeting in Russia's Kazan today, on the sidelines of the BRICS Summit that both leaders attended. This is the first "formal bilateral meeting" between the PM Modi and President Xi since the military stand-off between both countries began in 2020.</p>

<p>Ties between India and China took a severe hit and came to an abrupt halt after the military clash in Galwan Valley. It took four years of diplomatic and military-level talks between both sides to finally come to an agreement to reinstate the status quo to what it was before the stand-off in 2020.</p>

<p>Both countries welcomed the move and in less than 72 after the disengagement agreement, the two leaders met in Russia today.</p>

<p>To understand what exactly had happened back in 2020, what the friction points were, and the kind of build up China had in place since then - which has now been dismantled, we need maps and satellite images.</p>

<h2><strong>UNDERSTANDING THE MAP</strong></h2>

<p>This is the map of Ladakh with the Line of Actual Control or LAC marked in red. The area between the LAC and the original border in black is the Aksai Chin region of Ladakh occupied by China since the 1962 war. While Galwan Valley was where the military clash happened in May, 2020, there were several other friction points, namely - Depsang, Galwan, Gogra Hot Springs, Pangong Tso, and Demchok.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-10/taha99mo_ladakh-map-showing-lac_625x300_24_October_24.jpg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>Shortly after the uprising in China in 1959, and the occupation of Tibet that year, China started making claims in areas that fall in Ladakh, an "integral and inalienable" part of India. During the Sino-India war of 1962, Chinese troops had crossed the original border but had to withdraw later. It however never withdrew from Aksai Chin.</p>

<p>The dotted red line in the map above represents the approximate patrol points established by India and are the farthest points till where Indian soldiers patrol. All the areas labelled along the LAC are points where Chinese troops blocked Indian soldiers from reaching the last patrol point that would walk up to till 2020. This led to the military stand-off between India and China.</p>

<p>After the Galwan Clash in May, 2020, both sides brought in reinforcements - tens of thousands of troops and military hardware from tanks and artillery guns to fighter jets and drones. At this stage both sides started engaging in talks - both at diplomatic and military levels.</p>

<p>The disengagement talks began and both sides created disengagement zones, also known as buffer zones in the areas of Galwan - where the clash happened, Gogra Hot Springs, and Pangong.</p>

<h3><strong>What is a buffer zone?</strong></h3>

<ul>
	<li><em>Soldiers from both sides, as a result of a grievance, agreed to go back a certain number of kilometers, and the areas that fell in between, which included points that were disputed would be where troops from neither side would go. Structures that were built in these locations during the stand-off by either side were also removed as the disengagement talks progressed over the months and years.</em></li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>SATELLITE IMAGES</strong></h3>

<h3><big>Here are a set of satellite images that show the way the situation developed since 2020:</big></h3>

</div>

<p>This image shows the north side of the Pangong Lake where in June, 2020, Chinese soldiers came to an area that India claims and put markings of the flag of China and wrote beneath it in Mandarin that "This area belongs to China". This was a time when the Chinese had come right in along the Pangong Lake.</p>

<p><big><strong>Pangong Lake:</strong></big> About 50 per cent of Pangong Lake area is in Tibet (under Chinese control), 40 per cent in Ladakh and 10 per cent is disputed. Discrepancies in LAC perceptions lead to military standoffs and buffer zones, with ongoing construction and strategic positioning reflecting the tensions and claims by both nations.</p>

</div>

<p>This second image is also from the north bank of the Pangong Lake and a place where the Chinese had a major built-up area.</p>

</div>

<p>This third image shows the south bank of the Pangong Lake where the Chinese troops had brought in their boats (left side of the image) and the right side shows how these were eventually removed by Beijing as the disengagement process moved forward at a slow but steady pace.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">

</div>

<p>This fourth image is from where it all began - The Galwan Valley - where the clash took place in which soldiers on either side were killed in action. China set up and built multiple structures along the banks of the river and in the area where the river meanders. In this photo, the LAC is approximately 400 meters south of where the river is seen bending to the right. These were areas where Indian soldiers would patrol in the past, but in 2020, the Chinese soldiers attempted to stop them from doing that.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">

</div>

<p>In this fifth satellite image, we take a look at the Gogra Hot Springs area - an area which had seen conflict in 1962 as well. The screen is divided in two - the left showing the Chinese build-up in 2021, which they later dismantled in 2022 and vacated the area, as seen on the right.</p>

<p><big><strong>Gogra Hot Springs:</strong></big> Located near Gogra Post, the Hot Springs area is significant for India due to its strategic location which facilitates surveillance over LAC. India's control over this region enhances its defence posture, providing vantage points for monitoring movements in Aksai Chin, thus playing a crucial role in border security dynamics.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-10/47k1su88_gogra-ht-spring-area-china-base-relocation_625x300_24_October_24.jpg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>The sixth satellite image shows the relocated Chinese base. This was set up by China 3 kilometers south of the spot they vacated in the image shown above this one.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">

</div>

<p>This seventh image gives a clearer picture of where the Chinese had built a structure and where they relocated to as the disengagement talks continued. This was part of the buffer zone that was created in this particular area.</p>

<p>The eighth image shows the area in Depsang - an area of real concern. In a place called the Y-junction in Depsang, Chinese troops have set up a base and have been preventing Indian soldiers to patrol up to a point where they used to before 2020. As the photo shows, Indian soldiers have been prevented from moving east (right). If after the latest agreement of shifting the status quo to pre-2020 times, then Indian soldiers would now be able to patrol right up to the farthest point where they used to.</p>

<p><big><strong>Depsang:</strong></big> Depsang plains are critical for India due to their strategic access to the Daulat Beg Oldie (DBO) airstrip and the Darbuk-Shyok-DBO road. Control over Depsang prevents Chinese forces from threatening these vital logistics lines, making it essential for India's northern border defence and military mobility.</p>

<p><strong>WHAT PM MODI TOLD XI JINPING IN THEIR FIRST OFFICIAL MEET AFTER 2020</strong></p>

<p><em>"Excellency, I am happy to meet you, and like you mentioned, this is a formal meeting between us after five years. It is my belief that the importance of India-China relations is not just for the citizens of our two countries, but also very significant for peace, stability, and progress for the entire world.</em></p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A major international airport serving the UK's second-largest city was evacuated and all flights were suspended for several hours on Wednesday because of a security alert.</p>

<p>West Midlands Police in central England ordered the partial closure of Birmingham Airport after receiving reports of a suspicious vehicle.</p>

<p>Airport authorities advised passengers not to travel while those already awaiting flights were forced to leave terminals on foot with their luggage.</p>

<p>"Whilst we apologise for any inconvenience and disruption, the safety and security of everyone at the airport was our number one priority," a statement read.</p>

<p>West Midlands Police said the evacuation was a "precautionary measure" while the vehicle was searched and assessed.</p>

<p>"Following a search by the Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EDO) team the vehicle was deemed to be safe. The vehicle is no longer being treated as suspicious," it added.</p>

<p>Birmingham Airport is the seventh busiest UK airport by passenger numbers and is used as an operating base for easyJet, Ryanair, TUI Airways and Jet2.com.</p>

<p>Its busiest routes are to and from Dublin, Dubai, Amsterdam, Palma de Mallorca and Tenerife-South.</p>

<p>"Operations will slowly be returning to normal," an airport spokesperson said. "All passengers are advised to check latest flight information from their airline."<br />

       <description><![CDATA[Joe Biden was at a New Hampshire campaign on Tuesday when he started off by saying "We gotta lock him up," soon after he tweaked his statement to, "Politically lock him up". Backtracking further, he added, "Lock him out, thats what weve got to do."]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Joe Biden was at a New Hampshire campaign on Tuesday where he targeted Donald Trump by saying “We gotta lock him up”. He soon altered his statement to, “Politically lock him up”. He went on to backtrack further, saying, “Lock him out, that's what we've got to do.”</p>

<p>According to Joe Biden, American democracy would be at stake if Republican candidate Donald Trump beats Democratic candidate Kamala Harris.</p>

<p>In 2016, when Donald Trump ran for President, he presided over rallies where people chanted, “lock her up” referring to Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. He was never found hushing up people from these slogans and according to a fact check by CNN, he also falsely claimed that he did not make any “lock her up” calls then.</p>

<p>In contrast, this year, during Kamala Harris's rallies, spectators chanted, “lock him up”, to which she responded, “The courts are going to take care of that.”</p>

<p>In a statement, the national press secretary for Donald Trump's 2024 presidential campaign, &nbsp;Karoline Leavitt said, “Joe Biden just admitted the truth: he and Kamala's plan all along has been to politically persecute their opponent President Trump because they can't beat him fair and square.”</p>

<p>“The Harris-Biden Admin is the real threat to democracy. We call on Kamala Harris to condemn Joe Biden's disgraceful remark”, it said.</p>

<p>It is notable that throughout this year's campaigning, Trump has been threatening to prosecute or punish perceived enemies once he is in office.</p>

<p>Biden said, “This is a guy who also wants to replace every civil servant, every single one,” adding that “He thinks he has a right under the Supreme Court ruling on immunity to be able, if need be, if it was the case, to actually eliminate - physically eliminate, shoot, kill - someone who he believes would be a threat to him.”</p>

<p>The Supreme Court ruled that former presidents have immunity from criminal prosecution for actions taken during their term in office. However, this ruling has raised concerns, highlighted by Justice Sonia Sotomayor's dissenting opinion. She warned that this immunity could potentially shield extreme abuses of power, such as ordering the assassination of a political rival, from accountability.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Eminem, the renowned rapper originally from Detroit, on Tuesday, endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris, making it a star-studded affair. He then welcomed former President Barack Obama on the stage.</p>

<p>Mr Obama then took the stage to Eminem's iconic song "Lose Yourself", joking that he "noticed my palms are sweaty," moving on to rap a few lines from it.</p>

<p>The music legend and former president joined forces to support Kamala Harris' presidential campaign in Detroit. The latter being a longtime Democratic stronghold, will be crucial in deciding who wins the presidency, especially when Michigan stands as being one of the key swing states.</p>

<p>Obama cited Trump's Pennsylvania town-hall and delivered a scathing critique of Trump's fitness for office, where he swayed to songs for 40 minutes rather than answering questions for voters, after two people fainted there.</p>

<p>He continued to say, "If your grandpa was acting like this, you'd be worried." He added, "This is somebody who wants unchecked power. We do not need to see what an older, loonier Donald Trump looks like with no guardrails. America's ready to turn the page."</p>

<p>This joint, significant display of support for Harris comes just days before voting kicks off in Michigan, in hopes that this high-profile event will boost enthusiasm and solidify support for Harris and other Democratic candidates in the offing.</p>

<p>In other news, Trump also recently appeared with rapper Trick-Trick, which only goes on to show the city's importance in the presidential elections.</p>

<p>Trump, in a major gaffe, addressed the city he visited in an undignified manner. "The whole country will be like - you want to know the truth? It'll be like Detroit," Trump said as he addressed the Detroit Economic Club. "Our whole country will end up being like Detroit if she's your president."</p>

<p>However, Obama and other speakers effectively utilised his statements in their stride. Michigan Governor added to the conversation, "I know you all saw what he said about this beautiful city. He called Detroit a failure and a mess, proving he ain't firing on all cylinders," Whitmer said.</p>

<p>"He doesn't have a clue what the hell he was talking about. And you know what I think? He ought to keep Detroit out of his mouth," he added.</p>

<p>Eminem, during the rally had also said that the people should not be afraid of voicing their own opinions and emphasised Harris' commitment to protecting American freedoms, saying that she, "supports a future for this country where these freedoms and many others will be protected and upheld."<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Concerns over hospital and organ donation procedures were raised after a man from Kentucky woke up right before his organs were to be removed.</p>

<p>According to a report by the US public broadcasting organisation <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2024/10/16/nx-s1-5113976/organ-transplantion-mistake-brain-dead-surgery-still-alive"><em>National Public Radio (NPR),</em></a> Natasha Miller, an employee of Kentucky Hospital, was getting ready to do her job preserving donated organs for transplantation when the nurses wheeled the donor, Anthony Thomas "TJ" Hoover II, into the operating room.</p>

<p>Natasha recognised right away that something wasn't quite right. The donor appeared to her to be very much alive, even though he had been certified brain dead.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"He was moving around-kind of thrashing. Like, moving, thrashing around on the bed," Miller told <em>NPR</em> in an interview. "And then when we went over there, you could see he had tears coming down. He was crying visibly."</p>

<p>The donor's condition alarmed everyone in the operating room at Baptist Health Hospital in Richmond, Kentucky, including the two doctors, who refused to participate in the organ retrieval, she says.</p>

<p>"The procuring surgeon was like, 'I'm out of it. I don't want to have anything to do with it,'" Miller says. "It was very chaotic. Everyone was just very upset."</p>

<p>Miller says she overheard the case coordinator at the hospital for her employer, Kentucky Organ Donor Affiliates (KODA), call her supervisor for advice.</p>

<p>"So the coordinator calls the supervisor at the time. And she was saying that he was telling her that she needed to 'find another doctor to do'it'-that, 'We were going to do this case. She needs to find someone else,'" Miller says. "And she's like, 'There is no one else.' She's crying-the coordinator-because she's getting yelled at."</p>

<p>The case of Anthony Thomas "TJ" Hoover II is under investigation by state and federal government officials. In a letter to the US House of Representatives, whistleblower Nyckoletta Martin <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://energycommerce.house.gov/events/oversight-and-investigations-subcommittee-hearing-a-year-removed-oversight-of-securing-the-u-s-organ-procurement-and-transplantation-network-act-implementation">detailed her observations</a> while working for Kentucky Organ Donor Affiliates at the time of the incident.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The idea of the BRICS group ever challenging the US dollar is for the fairies as long as China and India remain so divided and refuse to cooperate on trade, the former Goldman Sachs economist who came up with the BRIC acronym told Reuters.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The idea of the BRICS group ever challenging the US dollar is for the fairies as long as China and India remain so divided and refuse to cooperate on trade, the former Goldman Sachs economist who came up with the BRIC acronym told Reuters.</p>

<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin is using the summit of BRICS leaders to show that Western attempts to isolate Russia over the Ukraine war have failed and that Russia is building ties with the rising powers of Asia.</p>

<p>Then-Goldman Sachs chief economist Jim O'Neill introduced the term BRIC in 2001 in a research paper that underlined the massive growth potential of Brazil, Russia, India and China - and the need to reform global governance to include them.</p>

<p>"The idea that the BRICS can be some genuine global economic club, it's obviously a bit out there with the fairies in the same way that the G7 can be, and it's very disturbing that they see themselves as some kind of alternative global thing, because it's obviously not feasible," O'Neill told Reuters.</p>

<p>"It seems to me basically to be a symbolic annual gathering where important emerging countries, particularly noisy ones like Russia, but also China, can basically get together and highlight how good it is to be part of something that doesn't involve the US and that global governance isn't good enough."</p>

<p>O'Neill, who admitted he would "have Mr BRICS stamped on my forehead forever", said the BRICS as a group had achieved very little over the past 15 years.</p>

<p>He added that it was not possible to solve truly global issues without the United States and Europe - just as it was not possible for the West to solve truly global issues without China, India and, to a lesser extent, Russia and Brazil.</p>

<p>The BRICS group grew out of meetings between Russia, India and China which then began to meet more formally, eventually adding Brazil, then South Africa, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran and the United Arab Emirates. Saudi Arabia has yet to formally join.</p>

<p>The group now accounts for 45 per cent of the world's population and 35 per cent of its economy, based on purchasing power parity, though China accounts for more than half of its economic might.</p>

<p>Putin opened the summit on Wednesday by saying that more than 30 states had expressed interest in joining the group but that it was important to strike a balance in any expansion.</p>

<p>Bringing in more members into BRICS would make achieving anything even harder, O'Neill said.</p>

<p><strong>Dollar challenge?</strong></p>

<p>Russia is seeking to convince BRICS countries to build an alternative platform for international payments that would be immune to Western sanctions.</p>

<p>O'Neill, 67, said people had been talking about alternatives to the dollar since he started out in finance but that none of the countries with the potential to challenge the dollar had done anything to seriously do so.</p>

<p>Any BRICS currency, he said, would be heavily dependent on China while Russia and Brazil would not be significant parts of it, he said.</p>

<p>"If they wanted to be really serious about economic matters, why don't they genuinely pursue less tariff based trade between each other?" O'Neill said.</p>

<p>"I will take the BRICS group seriously when I see signs that the two countries that really matter - China and India - are actually really trying to agree on things, rather than effectively trying to confront each other all the time."</p>

<p>India has tried to curb Chinese investments in the country since a decades old border dispute erupted into a clash between border guards in 2020. The two countries pledged to enhance cooperation on Wednesday in their first formal talks in five years.</p>

<p>Chinese President Xi Jinping told Putin the international situation was gripped by chaos but that Beijing's strategic partnership with Moscow was a force for stability amid the most significant changes seen in a century.</p>

<p>O'Neill said the G20 had failed to become a sinew of truly global governance because the United States and China had both turned inwards since the middle of the last decade. BRICS, he said, lacked clear objectives and should take on major issues for humanity - such as finding vaccines or drugs against infectious diseases, or fighting climate change.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Three people were found dead and four others were taken to hospital after a suspected carbon monoxide poisoning at a care home for the elderly in southwest England, police said on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Other residents at the Gainsborough Care Home in Swanage were evacuated from the premises to a nearby church hall as an investigation was launched.</p>

<p>Chief Superintendent Heather Dixey, of Dorset Police, said carbon monoxide poisoning was the investigation's "primary line of inquiry".</p>

<p>A spokesperson for gas network company SGN confirmed that engineers were called to the care home on Wednesday morning, the BBC reported.</p>

<p>The care home has 48 rooms and houses some residents with dementia.</p>

<p>"The families of those who have died have been informed and the coroner has been notified," the force said in a statement.</p>

<p>"At this time there is nothing to indicate any risk to the wider public."</p>

<p>South Western Ambulance Service said separately that it was called to the home at 0420 GMT and sent a hazardous area response team, 10 ambulances each with two crew, and "a significant number of additional resources".</p>

<p>"Two patients were conveyed by ambulance to Poole Hospital," it added.</p>

<p>The care home is run by Agincare, one of the UK's largest independent care providers.</p>

<p>At its last inspection October 2021 by the Care Quality Commission regulator, its standard of care was classed overall as "good".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli strikes on Wednesday pounded Lebanon's Tyre, an ancient coastal city which boasts a UNESCO World Heritage site, leaving swathes of its centre in ruins.</p>

<p>The raids, among the worst since the start of the Israel-Hezbollah war last month, hit the "heart of Tyre", said Rana, a resident who asked to only use her first name over security concerns.</p>

<p>"The whole city shook," said Rana, after fleeing to the seafront following an Israeli military warning for people to evacuate much of Tyre's centre in the morning.</p>

<p>Thick black plumes of smoke were seen rising from several neighbourhoods, with parts of the evacuation area just 500 metres (yards) from the city's ancient ruins.</p>

<p>The strikes caused "massive destruction and serious damage to homes, infrastructure, buildings, shops and cars," said the official National News Agency.</p>

<p>AFP footage showed entire neighbourhoods buried under rubble.</p>

<p>The Israeli army struck "command and control complexes of various Hezbollah units", according to a post from the military's Arabic-language spokesman, Avichay Adraee, on social media platform X.</p>

<p>Adraee described Tyre as an "important" Hezbollah stronghold, although Amal, an ally of the Iran-backed group, was believed to hold more sway there.</p>

<p>Bilal Kashmar of Tyre's disaster management unit said seven building were completely levelled and more than 400 apartments in their vicinity damaged in the strikes.</p>

<p>Four streets were completely blocked by debris, he told AFP, adding that at least two people were left wounded after most residents fled.</p>

<p><strong>Fresh exodus</strong></p>

<p>Before Hezbollah and Israel started trading fire over the border last year, at least 50,000 people lived in Tyre, a vibrant city home to both Christians and Muslims.</p>

<p>The city was emptied of most of its population when Israel's heavy bombardment began last month.</p>

<p>Only 14,500 remained there on Tuesday, Kashamr said.</p>

<p>But the city saw a fresh exodus on Wednesday as people began to escape immediately after the Israeli army issued an evacuation warning for four neighbourhoods at 8:00 am (0500 GMT).</p>

<p>Emergency teams drove around the city, urging people to evacuate over megaphones, a video journalist collaborating with AFP said.</p>

<p>An AFP photographer in the city of Sidon, further north, saw dozens of cars on the coastal highway filled with families carrying mattresses, suitcases and clothes.</p>

<p>"Some families, who had not left the city of Tyre before, began leaving their homes to stay clear of areas that the Israeli enemy threatened to target," NNA said.</p>

<p>Civil defence teams helped transport elderly people and people with limited mobility "to safe areas", the NNA added.</p>

<p><strong>Antique city</strong></p>

<p>The Risala Scouts, rescuers affiliated with Hezbollah ally Amal, deployed ambulances to targeted areas to transport wounded civilians to nearby hospitals.</p>

<p>"We are working on providing alternative housing with municipalities," said Rabih Issa, an official with the organisation.</p>

<p>Tyre is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world. It is home to important archaeological sites, mainly from Roman times.</p>

<p>Kashmar of Tyre's disaster management unit said there has yet to be a damage assessment for heritage sites.</p>

<p>However, "damage is possible," he said, explaining that one strike hit less than 50 metres away from one of the city's ruins.</p>

<p>UNESCO said it was "closely following the impact of the ongoing conflict on the World Heritage site of Tyre" using remote sensing tools and satellite imagery.</p>

<p>On September 23, Israel launched an intensive air campaign in Lebanon, after almost a year of cross-border exchanges with Hezbollah over the Gaza war.</p>

<p>Since then, at least 1,552 people have been killed in Israeli strikes on Lebanon, according to an AFP tally of health ministry figures, although the real number is likely to be higher due to data gaps.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The war between Israel and armed group Hezbollah is expected to wipe 9% off Lebanon's national wealth as measured by GDP, the United Nations said on Wednesday, with the scale of hostilities and the economic fallout set to surpass the last war in 2006.</p>

<p>The UN Development Programme's rapid appraisal of the conflict's impact on Lebanon's gross domestic product was released a day ahead of a summit hosted by France to help drum up international support for Lebanon.</p>

<p>UNDP said it expected the conflict to last until the end of 2024, leading to a 30% jump in the government's financing needs in a country in dire straits even before violence began.</p>

<p>"GDP is projected to decline by 9.2% compared to a no-war scenario, indicating a significant decline in economic activity as a direct consequence of the conflict (around 2 billion dollars)," the report said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>UNDP said that even if the war ended in 2024, the consequences would persist for years, with GDP likely to contract by 2.28% in 2025 and 2.43% in 2026.</p>

<p>Lebanon was already suffering a four-year-old economic downturn and a political crisis when Hezbollah began firing rockets at Israel last year in support of its Palestinian ally Hamas.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In late September, Israel dramatically ramped up its bombing across Lebanon, with strikes now regularly hitting Beirut's southern suburbs, major cities in southern Lebanon and parts of the eastern Bekaa Valley, including the border with Syria.</p>

<p>Hezbollah and Israel last fought in 2006, when a month-long conflict left much of Lebanon's south and the capital's southern suburbs in ruins and required international help to rebuild.</p>

<p>UNDP said the damage to physical infrastructure, housing and productive capacities like factories would likely be close to that estimated for the 2006 war, which was between $2.5 billion and $3.6 billion. But it warned of larger overall damage to Lebanon.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The scale of the military engagement, the geopolitical context, the humanitarian impact and the economic fallout in 2024 are expected to be much greater than in 2006," it said.</p>

<p>UNDP's report said the closure of border crossings critical for trade would bring a 21% drop in trade activities, and that it expected job losses in the tourism, agriculture and construction sectors.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It said Lebanon had already sustained "massive environmental losses" over the last year, including due to unexploded ordnance and contamination from possibly hazardous material, particularly the use of white phosphorus across southern Lebanon.</p>

<p>Government revenue is expected to fall by 9% and total investment by more than 6% through both 2025 and 2026.</p>

<p>As a result, increased international assistance will be essential for sustainable recovery in Lebanon, UNDP said - not only to address the spike in humanitarian needs but to stem the long-term social and economic consequences of the conflict.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Lebanon's minister in charge of its crisis response told Reuters that the country needed $250 million a month to help more than 1.2 million people displaced by Israeli strikes.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An Iranian hacking group is actively scouting US election-related websites and American media outlets as election day nears, according to a Microsoft blog published on Wednesday. Researchers say the activity suggests "preparations for more direct influence operations."</p>

<p>The hackers - dubbed Cotton Sandstorm by Microsoft and linked to Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps - performed reconnaissance and limited probing of multiple "election-related websites" in several unnamed swing states, the report notes. In May, they also scanned an unidentified US news outlet to understand its vulnerabilities.</p>

<p>"Cotton Sandstorm will increase its activity as the election nears given the group's operational tempo and history of election interference," researchers wrote. The development is particularly concerning because of the group's past efforts.</p>

<p>A spokesperson for Iran's mission to the United Nations said that "such allegations are fundamentally unfounded, and wholly inadmissible."</p>

<p>"Iran neither has any motive nor intent to interfere in the US election," they added.</p>

<p>In 2020, Cotton Sandstorm launched a different cyber-enabled influence operation shortly before the last presidential election. Posing as the right-wing "Proud Boys," the hackers sent thousands of emails to Florida residents, threatening them to "vote for Trump or else!".</p>

<p>The group also released a video on social media, purporting to come from hacktivists, where they showed them probing an election system. While that operation never affected individual voting systems, the goal was to cause chaos, confusion and doubt, senior U.S. officials said at the time.</p>

<p>Following the 2020 election, Cotton Sandstorm also ran a separate operation that encouraged violence against US election officials who had denied claims of widespread voter fraud, Microsoft said.</p>

<p>The Office of the Director of National Intelligence, which is coordinating the federal effort to defend the election from foreign influence, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bangladesh banned the student wing of ousted premier Sheikh Hasina's party on Thursday, citing its involvement in violent attacks on demonstrations that toppled the autocratic leader.</p>

<p>Sheikh Hasina fled the country in August as thousands marched on her official residence, ending a 15-year tenure that saw widespread human rights abuses.</p>

<p>The student wing of her Awami League party was accused of propping up her iron-fisted rule, which saw the mass detention and extrajudicial killings of her political opponents.</p>

<p>A government notice accused the party's youth wing, known as the Chhatra League, of involvement in "murders, persecution, torture... and many other activities that threaten public security".</p>

<p>The statement added that the student group had been outlawed under anti-terrorism laws.</p>

<p>Initially peaceful protests that began in July against Sheikh Hasina's government turned violent when Chhatra League activists attacked student demonstrators on university campuses.</p>

<p>The attempt by pro-government cadres to quell the protests instead fanned public anger, culminating in Sheikh Hasina's overthrow weeks later.</p>

<p>More than 700 people were killed in the resulting unrest, according to official estimates -- most in clashes between police and anti-Hasina protesters.</p>

<p>A Bangladeshi court this month issued an arrest warrant for the exiled leader, who fled to neighbouring India on the day of her overthrow.</p>

<p>Dozens of Sheikh Hasina's allies were taken into custody after her regime collapsed, accused of culpability in the police crackdown.</p>

<p>Former cabinet ministers and other senior members of the Awami League have been arrested, and her government's appointees were purged from courts and the central bank.</p>

<p>Sheikh Hasina, however, has not been seen in public since fleeing the country by helicopter.</p>

<p>The 77-year-old's last official whereabouts are a military airbase near Delhi.</p>

<p>Her presence in India -- her government's biggest benefactor -- has infuriated the interim administration in Bangladesh that replaced her.</p>

<p>Dhaka has revoked her diplomatic passport, and the countries have a bilateral extradition treaty which would facilitate her return to face criminal trial.</p>

<p>A clause in the treaty, however, says extradition might be refused if the offence is of a "political character".</p>

<p>Sheikh Hasina was replaced by Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus, who was sworn in to helm an interim administration days after her departure.</p>

<p>The 84-year-old microfinance pioneer's temporary administration is facing what he has called the "extremely tough" challenge of restoring democratic institutions.</p>

<p>Yunus has said he inherited a "completely broken down" system of public administration and justice that needs a comprehensive overhaul to prevent a future return to autocracy.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hezbollah confirmed Wednesday that Israel killed Hashem Safieddine, the apparent successor of its ex leader Hassan Nasrallah, in a strike, without saying when or where it happened.</p>

<p>The announcement came a day after Israel said he was killed along with other Hezbollah leaders in an air strike in Beirut's southern suburbs three weeks ago.</p>

<p>"We mourn... the head of the Executive Council of Hezbollah, his eminence the scholar Sayyed Hashem Safieddine," the Iran-backed group said in a statement, adding he was killed by "a criminal and aggressive Zionist raid" alongside other Hezbollah fighters.</p>

<p>The deeply religious Safieddine, a cleric with family ties to Nasrallah, had been widely viewed as the most likely candidate for the party's top job after the assassination of Nasrallah on September 27 in a huge Israeli air strike on Beirut's southern suburbs.</p>

<p>Safieddine, a member of the group's governing Shura Council, had strong ties to Iran after undergoing religious studies in the Islamic republic's holy city of Qom.</p>

<p>The United States and Saudi Arabia had put him on their respective lists of designated "terrorists" in 2017.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Norway's Crown Princess Mette-Marit has been placed on sick leave for at least a week due to a rare lung condition from which she suffers, the palace said Wednesday.</p>

<p>The 51-year-old wife of Crown Prince Haakon announced in October 2018 that she had been diagnosed with a rare form of pulmonary fibrosis, an incurable disease that causes scarring of the lungs and shortness of breath.</p>

<p>"Due to side effects from the medication that the Crown Princess has to take for her chronic lung disease, she has been placed on sick leave, initially for one week," the palace said on its website.</p>

<p>The condition has at times affected her royal duties, requiring her to lighten her load or cancel engagements.</p>

<p>"She will never be cured, but the illness is not deteriorating very rapidly, which is what the doctors are aiming for," Haakon said in an official autobiography published last year.</p>

<p>"She has many good days. But the uncertainty is always there. Do we have to cancel? We never know. Illness is also a part of life, as is addressing challenges together," he added.</p>

<p>Mette-Marit has been in the Norwegian headlines recently after her 27-year-old son -- from a relationship prior to her marriage to the crown prince -- was accused by several ex-girlfriends of assault, most recently in August when he admitted being under the influence of alcohol and cocaine.</p>

<p>She has repeatedly told media that she is unable to comment on the case "out of respect for all parties".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Wednesday met legislators from his ruling Liberals, some of whom blame him for the party's poor showing in the polls and want him to quit after nine years in power.</p>

<p>While Trudeau is in no immediate danger, since he cannot be pushed out, the public display of unhappiness is among the most serious political challenges he has faced. Major parties usually meet on Wednesdays, but the circumstances this time are unusual.</p>

<p>Trudeau insists he will lead the Liberals into the next election, which must be held by the end of October 2025, even though surveys of public opinion suggest that with him at the helm, the party will lose badly to the official opposition Conservatives.</p>

<p>A Nanos Research poll released on Oct. 15 put the Conservatives on 39% public support, with the Liberals well behind on 23% and the rival left-leaning New Democrats on 21%. Such a result on election day would give the Conservatives a comfortable majority.</p>

<p>The Canadian Broadcasting Corp said 24 of the party's 153 legislators had signed a letter calling on Trudeau to go.</p>

<p>Ken McDonald, a Liberal parliamentarian from Atlantic Canada who is not standing in the next election, said ahead of the meeting that some of those who signed the letter "are worried because of the polling that is going constantly down."</p>

<p>Wayne Long, another legislator from the same region, said if the party had a new leader it could beat the Conservatives, who blame Trudeau for rising prices and a housing crisis.</p>

<p>There is no mechanism to oust Trudeau. Unlike Australia, where leaders are elected by legislators, Canadian party chiefs are chosen by members at a special convention.</p>

<p>Unhappiness with Trudeau bubbled up after the party lost two of its safest parliamentary seats in special elections in June and September.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An army of Chinese-controlled social media bots is attempting to influence voters in Alabama, Texas and Tennessee, while denigrating Florida Senator Marco Rubio, according to new research published on Wednesday by Microsoft.</p>

<p>The operation represents a coordinated interference effort against down ballot races, experts say, in which the fake accounts are denigrating Representative Barry Moore of Alabama, Texas representative Michael McCaul, Tennessee Senator Marsha Blackburn and Rubio, all Republicans.</p>

<p>The troll network has "parroted antisemitic messages, amplified accusations of corruption and promoted opposition candidates," according to Microsoft.</p>

<p>The group responsible is known as Taizi Flood, which has been previously associated with China's Ministry of Public Security, researchers say. The lawmakers were each targeted because they had denounced Chinese government policies historically, the report notes.</p>

<p>China's embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>

<p>Among other things, the bots criticized Moore's support for Israel and used antisemitic language. Another collective of related accounts claimed Rubio was part of a financial corruption scheme.</p>

<p>The bots amplified support for Blackburn's election rival while spreading claims she took money from pharmaceutical companies. With McCaul, they pushed narratives that he engaged in insider trading.</p>

<p>Moore, McCaul and Blackburn are all running for reelection next month. Rubio, who serves as vice chair of the Senate intelligence committee, is not up for reelection until 2028.</p>

<p>The Microsoft researchers found the influence effort did not result "in high levels of engagement." The report did not provide any metrics for how many Americans viewed the relevant social media posts.</p>

<p>A spokesperson for Moore, Madison Green, said his office was aware of the campaign.</p>

<p>"We know that the CCP is antisemitic, so it isn't surprising that they are targeting me and other politicians who support Israel to try sow division in advance of the most important election in our lifetime," said Moore.</p>

<p>"China has made it clear they will use every weapon in their arsenal, including offensive cyber capabilities, to try and destroy democracy across the world," he added.</p>

<p>Spokespeople for the other three lawmakers did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>

<p>The Office of the Director of National Intelligence, which is coordinating the federal effort to defend the election from foreign influence, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Scientists have discovered dinosaur fossils in Hong Kong for the first time, the city's government announcement on Wednesday, adding that the species remains unknown.</p>

<p>Experts from Hong Kong and mainland China identified the fossils as belonging to a large, aged dinosaur from the Cretaceous period, around 145 million to 66 million years ago, the Development Bureau said in a statement.</p>

<p>The first humans are believed to have appeared on Earth around six million years ago.</p>

<p>Further analysis will be conducted to confirm the species of the dinosaur, the statement said.</p>

<p>The fossils will be put on public display from Friday, it added.</p>

<p>They were discovered on Hong Kong's remote, northeastern Port Island, where suspected vertebrate fossils were first spotted in sedimentary rock in March.</p>

<p>The small, uninhabited outlying islet -- part of Hong Kong's 150-square-kilometre (58-square-mile) UNESCO Global Geopark -- has been closed from Wednesday for further excavations.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The 2024 Paris Olympics' gender parity milestone was tainted by gender-related disputes, with a recent United Nations report voicing concerns about issues related to women's sports competition.</p>

<p>According to the report, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://documents.un.org/doc/undoc/gen/n24/249/94/pdf/n2424994.pdf"><em>"Violence Against Women and Girls in Sports,"</em> </a>transgender athletes have won around 900 medals in different women's sports at several events, replacing female athletes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It also brought attention to the fact that more than 600 female athletes had lost against individuals born male in a variety of competitions, escalating the argument about competition fairness.</p>

<p>These findings spotlight significant gaps in the IOC's policies, which continue to affect athletes globally, raising questions about the future of gender inclusivity in sports.</p>

<p>"Policies implemented by International Federations, national governing bodies, along with national legislation of some countries, allow males who identify as women to compete in female sports categories," the report said.</p>

<p>"In other cases, this practice is not explicitly prohibited and is thus tolerated in practice. The replacement of the female sports category with a mixed sex category has resulted in an increasing number of female athletes losing opportunities including medals when competing against males."</p>

<p>"According to information received, by 30 March 2024, over 600 female athletes in more than 400 competitions have lost more than 890 medals in 29 different sports," the report said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;Elon Musk's social media platform X will file documents requested by Brazil's Supreme Court and ask by this Monday that service be restored in the country, according to two people familiar with the situation.</p>

<p>Access to the platform formerly known as Twitter has been blocked in Brazil since the end of August, following an order by Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes. The judge and the U.S. tech firm have been at loggerheads over his investigation of "digital militias" he has accused of spreading hate messages in Brazil.</p>

<p>The dispute led X to close its offices in the country and let go of employees including its legal agent, breaching a local law.</p>

<p>The platform may again be available to Brazilians as early as next week after X provides documents requested by the court proving it now has a legal representative in the country, said the sources familiar with X's plans.</p>

<p>X and the Brazilian Supreme Court did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p>

<p>Last week, X lawyers said the company had appointed a legal representative in Brazil, as ordered by the Supreme Court, but it did not initially provide documents to prove the appointee was formally able to respond for the company. Once the new set of documents have been sent, the firm expects the issue to be resolved, according to the sources.</p>

<p>The sources said X has also started to comply with the court's other demands - blocking profiles of people allegedly spreading fake news and paying a 18 million reais ($3 million) fine via accounts of Musk's Starlink.</p>

<p>The social media firm is keen to smooth over the relationship with Moraes and operate like any other tech company in the country, said one of the sources.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Wednesday survived a vote of no confidence, with 211 lawmakers opposing and 120 in favor, in the first major test of his minority Liberal government.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Wednesday survived a vote of no confidence in the first major test of his minority Liberal government whose popularity has waned after nine years in office.</p>

<p>His tenuous grip on power, however, is already set to face more challenges in the coming days and weeks, with the main opposition Conservatives vowing to try again to topple the government as early as Tuesday.</p>

<p>Following a heated debate that saw members of Parliament trade insults and slam their fists on desks, they voted 211 to 120 against the Conservative motion to unseat the Liberals and force snap elections.</p>

<p>Far ahead in public opinion polls, Tory leader Pierre Poilievre has been itching for a snap election since the leftist New Democratic Party (NDP) earlier this month tore up a coalition agreement with the Liberals, leaving the Trudeau administration vulnerable to being toppled.</p>

<p>A combative Poilievre has railed against Trudeau for what he said was a failure to address soaring costs of living, a housing crisis and crime, while doubling the national debt.</p>

<p>The promise of Canada, "after nine years of Liberal government, is broken," he said during a Commons debate on Tuesday.</p>

<p>But other opposition parties, whose support is needed to topple the Liberals, have pushed back against his rightwing agenda.</p>

<p>Liberal House leader Karina Gould accused the Tories of "playing games."</p>

<p>"I think it's pretty lame that they're going to put forward another non-confidence vote tomorrow," she said.</p>

<p><strong>- Try, try again -</strong></p>

<p>Immediately following the no confidence vote, the NDP again sided with the Liberals to pass legislation on capital gains taxes, averting another political crisis.</p>

<p>Poilievre has vowed to keep trying, with the next opportunity to bring down the government to be presented next week. If that fails, he will have a few more chances before the end of the year.</p>

<p>The separatist Bloc Quebecois has also demanded concessions from the ruling Liberals for its continued support in Parliament beyond the end of October.</p>

<p>Trudeau swept to power in 2015, and has managed to hold on by defeating two of Poilievre's predecessors in 2019 and 2021 ballots.</p>

<p>The deal with the New Democratic Party to prop up the Liberals would have kept his government in office until late 2025.</p>

<p>But the NDP, seeing its alignment with the Liberals hurting its own popularity, exited the deal early.</p>

<p>According to a recent Angus Reid poll, the Conservatives are well ahead of the Liberals, with 43 percent of voting intention against 21 percent for the ruling party. The NDP is at 19 percent.</p>

<p>Going forward, NDP leader Jagmeet Singh said his party would evaluate each bill in Parliament before deciding how to vote.</p>

<p>With legislation pending on NDP priorities including a national dental plan, political analysts who spoke to AFP suggested an election won't likely be triggered until at least spring 2025.</p>

<p>However, University of Ottawa professor Genevieve Tellier told AFP: "Anything is possible. It could come before Christmas."</p>

<p>In the meantime, a weakened Trudeau administration under constant threat "will find it more difficult to govern," she said.</p>

<p>Bloc leader Yves-Francois Blanchette said Wednesday he would seek to keep the government afloat until the end of October.</p>

<p>But if there has been no movement on its legislative priorities by then, he said the Bloc would turn against the Liberals.</p>

<p>In Canada's Westminster parliamentary system, a ruling party must hold the confidence of the House of Commons, which means maintaining support from a majority of members.</p>

<p>The Liberals currently have 153 seats, versus 119 for the Conservatives, 33 for the Bloc Quebecois, and the NDP 25.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Kamala Harris and Donald Trump will on Wednesday lay out rival visions for the economy, the top issue for many US voters, ahead of the vice president's first major solo interview since entering the White House race.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kamala Harris and Donald Trump will on Wednesday lay out rival visions for the economy, the top issue for many US voters, ahead of the vice president's first major solo interview since entering the White House race.</p>

<p>Harris is giving a speech in Pittsburgh, an industrial city in the key swing state of Pennsylvania, in which the Democrat will set out what her campaign says is a "pragmatic" policy, contrasting with that of billionaire former president Trump.</p>

<p>The vice president will then sit down with the left-leaning news channel MSNBC, in a rare test of her ability to deal with unscripted questions since taking over from President Joe Biden as the party's standard-bearer.</p>

<p>Republican contender Trump delivered remarks on what he called a "Made in America" economy, although he made headlines on foreign policy as he upped his harsh rhetoric against US adversary Iran.</p>

<p>The dueling events were taking place against a backdrop of fresh security worries with Trump, who has already escaped two assassination attempts this year, saying that there were "big threats" on his life from Tehran.</p>

<p>A gunman accused of planning to kill Trump at his Florida golf course just over a week ago, Ryan Routh, was indicted Tuesday for the attempted assassination of a major presidential candidate.</p>

<p>The election remains on a knife-edge less than six weeks before November 5 voting day, with many Americans saying the economy is the most important issue after years of high prices in the post-Covid rebound.</p>

<p>Harris and Trump are both tailoring their economic messaging at the tiny number of wavering voters, in around half a dozen swing states, who are expected to decide the election for a nation of 330 million people.</p>

<p>Since replacing Biden in July, polls have shown Harris gaining on Trump in terms of whom voters trust most on the economy -- but that voters remain unfamiliar with her policies.</p>

<p>- 'Putting America first' -</p>

<p>Harris's campaign said her speech in Pittsburgh would focus on her own middle-class upbringing to show she understands the pressures of making ends meet, in contrast to tycoon Trump.</p>

<p>"For Donald Trump, our economy works best if it works for those who own the big skyscrapers. Not those who build them. Not those who wire them. Not those who mop the floors," she plans to say, according to the campaign.</p>

<p>She will also unveil proposals to "make sure America leads the world in manufacturing in the industries of the future."</p>

<p>Trump is making similar pledges to boost American manufacturing, but with his own protectionist twist.</p>

<p>He told supporters in Mint Hill, North Carolina that his "unwavering commitment to putting America first is exactly what this country needs to restore our economy."</p>

<p>Trump complained that the Biden administration had allowed Iran's President Masoud Pezeshkian to address to the UN General Assembly in New York with "large security forces guarding him," while the ex-president was under threat from the US adversary.</p>

<p>The comment came the Trump campaign said that top US intelligence officials briefed the candidate on threats from Iran to assassinate him.</p>

<p>"If I were the president, I would inform the threatening country -- in this case, Iran -- that if you do anything to harm this person, we are going to blow your largest cities and the country itself to smithereens," he said.</p>

<p>Harris's MSNBC interview being broadcast at 7pm ET (2300 GMT) is meanwhile part of her effort to define herself after criticism from Republicans for largely avoiding major interviews and giving no press conferences.</p>

<p>Since Biden dropped out she has only given one interview with a national TV network, in August, when she and her running mate Tim Walz sat for a joint CNN interview.</p>

<p>Trump's vice-presidential pick J.D. Vance described the decision to go on liberal-leaning MSNBC as "legitimately pathetic for a person who wants to be president."</p>

<p>Trump has given a number of interviews in recent weeks, but many of those have also been to friendly media -- while several of his events billed as press conferences ended with him taking no questions.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ahead of Lebanese engineer Maya Gharib's wedding planned for next month, excited relatives were arranging for her dress to be picked up.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But on Monday, 23-year-old Gharib, her two sisters and their parents were killed in an Israeli strike on their home in a suburb of the southern city of Tyre, said Gharib's brother Reda, the only surviving member of the family.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Israel says Monday's strikes targeted Hezbollah weapons. Lebanon's health ministry said the attacks left more than 550 people dead, including at least 50 children and 98 women, in Lebanon's bloodiest day since the end of the 1975-90 Civil War.</p>

<p>A screenshot shared with Reuters shows a message sent by a relative to the dress shop after the Gharib family died: "The bride was martyred."</p>

<p>"They were just sitting at home, and then the house was targeted," Reda Gharib, who moved to Senegal last year for work, told Reuters in a phone call.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The family were buried in a rushed funeral the next day, with few people in attendance due to the danger of strikes. Reda was unable to fly in as most flights had been cancelled amid ongoing Israeli attacks and rocket fire from Hezbollah.&nbsp;</p>

<p>His father was a retired veteran of Lebanon's army, a cross-sectarian force funded by the US and other countries and widely seen as source of unity in Lebanon. His sisters were all in their 20s.</p>

<p>"We are a nationalistic family with no party affiliation, though of course we stand with everyone who resists aggression," Reda Gharib said, noting no member of the family was a member of Hezbollah.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But he says that now, having lost his family, he wanted Hezbollah to continue fighting Israel "until victory" and not to accept any negotiations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>'INDISCRIMINATE'</p>

<p>Hezbollah began firing rockets at Israel on Oct. 8, the day after the Palestinian group Hamas attacked southern Israel, declaring a "support front" for Palestinians.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The clashes escalated sharply since last week, with hundreds killed and thousands injured in Lebanon as Israel wages an air campaign that has seen strikes in most parts of the country.</p>

<p>In the days since the chaos unleashed by the Israeli strikes on Monday, other reports have emerged of families with many members killed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the southern town of Hanouiyeh, an Israeli strike killed eight members of one family and a live-in domestic worker from Gambia, relatives said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mohammad Saksouk, whose brother Hasan was among those killed, told Reuters the strike hit a building next to the family home, which collapsed onto theirs.</p>

<p>He said the family had nothing to do with Hezbollah and criticized the Israelis for "indiscriminate" attacks while also questioning why Lebanon had been dragged into a battle that Hezbollah says is in support of Palestinians.</p>

<p>"Now, we're homeless. We are living in the streets," he said via phone from a temporary shelter. "Before, we were living completely normal lives. Who will give us back our homes?"</p>

<p>The victims included Hasan Saksouk, his adult children Mohammad and Mona, Mohammad's wife Fatima and their 9-month-old daughter Rima, as well as Mona's three children, all under nine years old.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Anna, the Gambian worker in her early 30s, also perished.</p>

<p>The coastal town of Saksakieh saw 11 civilians killed on Monday, including six women and two children, according to Mayor Ali Abbas, who said there were direct strikes on homes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"These are civilian homes, they have nothing to do with any kind of military installation," Abbas told Reuters.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NASA said on Tuesday the launch of its Crew-9 mission with SpaceX has been pushed back to Sept. 28 due to Tropical Storm Helene.</p>

<p>SpaceX's upcoming Crew Dragon mission, a routine flight called Crew-9, is expected to send one NASA astronaut and a Russian cosmonaut to the International Space Station.</p>

<p>Although Helene is moving through the Gulf of Mexico and expected to impact the northwest of region of Florida, it is large enough that high winds and heavy rain are expected in the Cape Canaveral region, from where the mission is set to be launched.</p>

<p>The Crew-9 mission was originally stated to be launched no earlier than Aug. 18, but was pushed back a month to spend more time analyzing issues with Boeing's Starliner spacecraft, which remains docked at the station.</p>

<p>NASA astronaut Nick Hague and Roscosmos cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov are to launch aboard the Dragon spacecraft to the ISS, on what will be the ninth crew rotation mission with SpaceX under the space agency's Commercial Crew Program.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US Muslim advocacy group Emgage Action on Wednesday endorsed Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris, saying former President Donald Trump posed a greater danger to the community with his promise to reinstate a travel ban affecting majority-Muslim countries.</p>

<p>The group, which endorsed President Joe Biden in 2020 after first backing Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, says it mobilized 1 million Muslim voters in that election.</p>

<p>Harris already won the endorsement of smaller Muslim groups, including the Black Muslim Leadership Council Fund and the American Muslim Democratic Caucus ahead of the Nov. 5 election.</p>

<p>Trump's campaign had no immediate comment.</p>

<p>He says he will reinstate the so-called "travel ban" that restricts entry into the United States of people from a list of largely Muslim-dominant countries. Biden rolled back the ban shortly after taking office in 2021.</p>

<p>The Biden administration, where Harris serves as vice president, has faced calls from both fellow Democrats and international allies throughout Israel's campaign in Gaza to press Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government to ease the devastating humanitarian crisis in the Palestinian enclave.</p>

<p>The US, Israel's biggest ally and weapons supplier, has sent Israel more than 10,000 highly destructive 2,000-pound (900-kg) bombs and thousands of Hellfire missiles since the start of the Gaza war in October, US officials told Reuters in June.</p>

<p>The war in the Gaza Strip began on October 7, 2023, when Hamas gunmen stormed into Israeli communities, killing some 1,200 people and abducting about 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.</p>

<p>Since then, Israel's military has leveled swaths of Gaza, driving nearly all of its 2.3 million people from their homes, giving rise to deadly hunger and disease and killing more than 41,000 people, according to Palestinian health authorities.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Vladimir Putin today issued a nuclear warning to the West in the event of a "massive" air attack on Russia. This includes the use of cruise missiles which the UK has supplied to Ukraine for Kyiv to target locations deep within Russian territory.</p>

<p>President Putin's remarks came after his urgent meeting with Moscow's top security council to discuss Russia's nuclear deterrence.</p>

<p>Russia's threat comes amid rising concerns in Moscow over Ukraine being allowed by Western powers - especially the UK and US - to use cruise missiles against it.</p>

<p>Last week the UK reportedly cleared the use of its 'Storm Shadow' cruise missile to be used to bomb Russia. UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer even flew to Washington DC to meet US President Joe Biden. The two leaders reportedly discussed Ukraine's use of weapons on Russian soil.</p>

<p>The Russian intelligence had information about such a possibility and had said earlier this month that "It has become necessary for Moscow to revise its nuclear doctrine because of the West's escalation of the war in Ukraine."</p>

<p>Speaking about the reports that the United States and United Kingdom are about to give clearance to Ukraine for Kyiv to launch cruise missiles on Russian soil, President Putin said this month that, "The West would be directly fighting with Russia if it gave such permission to Ukraine (to bomb Russia)" adding that Moscow would be forced to make "appropriate decisions" in such a scenario.</p>

<h2><strong>RUSSIA'S NUCLEAR DOCTRINE &amp; TREATY WITH US</strong></h2>

<p>Russia is the world's largest nuclear power. Together, Russia and the United States control 88% of the world's nuclear weapons.</p>

<p>Russia's current nuclear doctrine was set in place by Vladimir Putin four years ago, before the war with Ukraine broke out. According to the current doctrine, Russia may use nuclear weapons in the scenario where it comes under a nuclear attack or if a conventional attack threatens the existence of the state.</p>

<p>The United States and Russia have a nuclear treaty called the US-Russia New START Treaty, which entered into force on February 5, 2011.</p>

<p>Under the treaty, the United States and the Russian Federation had seven years to meet the treaty's central limits on strategic offensive arms (by February 5, 2018) and are then obligated to maintain those limits for as long as the treaty remains in force.</p>

<p>According to the US State Department, this treaty enhances US national security by placing verifiable limits on all Russian deployed intercontinental-range nuclear weapons. The United States and the Russian Federation have agreed to extend the treaty through February 4, 2026.</p>

<p>According to a Reuters report, the Kremlin said that any discussions about a replacement to the US-Russia New START Treaty, which expires in 2026, would need to take into account European nuclear potential - shorthand for the arsenals of Britain and France.</p>

<p>"We have not yet received a response from the Americans to this, but of course an agreement is needed and negotiations should begin as soon as possible," Peskov said when asked about a possible replacement for the New START Treaty.</p>

<h3><strong>THE STORM SHADOW MISSILE</strong></h3>

<p>Ukraine already has the UK-supplied Storm Shadow missile, but uses it only within its territory to combat Russian forces.</p>

<p>So far, there are restriction on Ukraine on the use of advanced western weaponry on targets within the Russian territory, but this is likely to change with clearances reportedly being issued by the UK, with US backing it.</p>

<p>The Storm Shadow is a low-observable, long-range air-launched cruise missile. It is jointly developed by the United Kingdom and France and has a range of around 500 km. It has already been integrated into Ukrainian fighter aircraft, including the Russia-built Su-24 bombers - a legacy of the past, from when Ukraine was part of the erstwhile Soviet Union.</p>

<p>Developed in 1994 and manufactured by Matra and British Aerospace, the Storm Shadow missile is now made by MBDA Systems. 'Storm Shadow' is the weapon's British name, while in France it is called the SCALP-EG.</p>

<h3><strong>RUSSIAN NUCLEAR WEAPONS STOCKPILE</strong></h3>

<p>Should Ukraine use cruise missiles to attack Russian territory, a Russian response to this could be massive. The international worry is that Moscow may seriously consider the use of nuclear weapons in such a scenario.</p>

<p>According to Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation - a nonpartisan non-profit organisation on nuclear weapons disarmament - Russia maintains a stockpile of an estimated 6,372 nuclear warheads - the world's largest.</p>

<p>Of these, 1,572 of which are deployed on strategic land-based ballistic missiles, submarine-launched ballistic missiles, and heavy bombers. Approximately 870 more strategic warheads and 1,870 non-strategic warheads are in reserve with an additional estimated 2,060 warheads awaiting dismantlement.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As Israeli bombs flattened buildings and sent smoke billowing skywards over Lebanon this week, Gazans looked on with both empathy and fear over how the widening war might affect them.</p>

<p>Israel carried out a third day of air strikes against Lebanon on Wednesday, saying it was targeting weapons caches and infrastructure belonging to the Lebanon-based Hezbollah group.</p>

<p>In a dramatic escalation after nearly a year of cross-border violence, Israeli air raids on Monday killed at least 558 people in Lebanon in the country's deadliest day since the 1975-1990 civil war.</p>

<p>After the unprecedented October 7 attack by Hamas against southern Israel, Hezbollah said it began striking Israel in solidarity with Hamas, another Iran-backed group.</p>

<p>The October 7 attack sparked the ongoing war in the Gaza Strip, marked by relentless Israeli bombardment that has devastated much of the Palestinian territory.</p>

<p>Chadi Nawfal, a 24-year-old resident of Gaza City who said he lost his home in an Israeli strike, told AFP on Wednesday that footage from Lebanon was hard to watch.</p>

<p>"The bloody scenes from Lebanon that we see on our television screens are very harsh images," he told AFP.</p>

<p>"We people in the Gaza Strip are the only ones who can currently feel the pain that the Lebanese people are experiencing."</p>

<p>The sustained Israeli aerial assault on Lebanon is the latest in a series of attacks that began last week with coordinated blasts of Hezbollah pagers and walkie-talkies.</p>

<p>The explosions killed 39 people and wounded almost 3,000, and were followed by a deadly strike on Friday on south Beirut, with leading Hezbollah commander Ibrahim Aqil among the dead.</p>

<p><strong>Israeli focus moves north</strong></p>

<p>Another strike on the Lebanese capital on Tuesday killed Hezbollah rocket forces commander Ibrahim Kobeissi.</p>

<p>Taken together, Israel's onslaught confirmed its Defence Minister Yoav Gallant's claim a week ago that the war's "centre of gravity" was moving northward.</p>

<p>Hezbollah fire has displaced tens of thousands of Israelis, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government has said it is determined to return them to their homes along the border with Lebanon.</p>

<p>Ayman al-Amreiti, another displaced resident of Gaza City, said he was worried the fighting in Lebanon would mean the ongoing war in Gaza gets less global attention.</p>

<p>"The military weight is now shifting to Lebanon, so even the media attention on the Gaza Strip has become secondary," the 42-year-old told AFP.</p>

<p>"This encourages the appetite of the occupation (Israel) to commit more crimes."</p>

<p>Hamas's attack on Israel nearly a year ago resulted in the deaths of 1,205 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures that include hostages killed in captivity.</p>

<p>Of the 251 hostages seized by Hamas operatives that day, 97 are still being held in Gaza, including 33 the Israeli military says are dead.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory military offensive has killed at least 41,495 people in Gaza, mostly civilians, according to figures provided by the Hamas-run territory's health ministry.</p>

<p>The United Nations has described the figures as reliable.</p>

<p><strong>'The victims are the people'</strong></p>

<p>There are obvious differences in timeframe and scale, but Umm Munzir Naim, 52, told AFP she could not help but see similarities between the fighting in Lebanon and in Gaza.</p>

<p>"The war against Lebanon and Hezbollah is a war like in Gaza. The victims are the people," she said.</p>

<p>"The small, the big, the properties, everything is targeted -- humans, trees...</p>

<p>"They say it's against Hamas and Hezbollah, but on the ground it's people who die."</p>

<p>Amreiti said he hoped the fighting would end soon in both places, and that their fates could even be linked given Hezbollah's past pledges to stop fighting once a Gaza ceasefire comes about.</p>

<p>"The outcome, the hope is that any settlement with Hezbollah will also involve Gaza," he said.</p>

<p>"Right now, that is the hope that the children of the Palestinian people are turning to."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two defendants in a mass rape trial that has shocked France on Wednesday reluctantly admitted they had raped a man's heavily sedated wife as they had not sought her consent.</p>

<p>The main defendant in the case, 71-year-old Dominique Pelicot, has confessed to administering sedatives to his wife to rape her and inviting strangers to join in the sexual abuse from 2011 to 2020.</p>

<p>Another 49 men have also been charged with rape or attempted rape of his wife Gisele Pelicot.</p>

<p>The hearings began in early September in the southern city of Avignon.</p>

<p>Gisele Pelicot, who is also 71 and has since divorced her husband, requested the case be heard in public to raise awareness about the use of drugs to commit sexual abuse.</p>

<p>In court on Wednesday, the latest of the defendants, 43-year-old Husamettin D., was at first not prepared to accept the charges against him.</p>

<p>He recounted how Dominique Pelicot had invited him over after they met online in June 2019.</p>

<p>Husamettin D. said Dominique Pelicot told him his wife was next to him as they communicated via chat.</p>

<p>He added that he had received a message that read: "I am indeed his wife, and I agree to welcome you."</p>

<p>Husamettin D. headed over to their home in the small town of Mazan that same evening, where he was led into the main bedroom.</p>

<p>"I started foreplay, I saw she didn't react. I said, 'She's dead, your wife.' (Dominique Pelicot) said, 'No, you're imagining it.' He penetrated her and she lifted up her head a little," Husamettin D. said.</p>

<p>The defendant added that they continued for at least half an hour, until he clearly heard Gisele Pelicot snoring. He then decided to leave, he said.</p>

<p>But he added: "I'm not a rapist, that's too much for me to bear. It's her husband. I never thought that guy could do that to his own wife."</p>

<p>Reminded of the definition of rape by one of the judges, an act committed "through violence, constraint, threat or surprise", Husamettin D. however conceded.</p>

<p>"Now I admit it was rape," he said.</p>

<p>Mathieu D., 53, accepted the charges against him.</p>

<p>He said that Dominique Pelicot had told him his wife "would have been put to sleep by him administering her drugs" so that the couple could "later watch the videos together".</p>

<p>He said he did not have the impression he was committing rape at the time, but later "realised" after being arrested that Gisele Pelicot had not given her consent.</p>

<p>Dominique Pelicot meticulously documented the abuse, with his pictures and videos later allowing investigators to identify dozens of suspects.</p>

<p>Police discovered he had been abusing his wife for almost a decade after he was detained in 2020 for filming up women's skirts, or "upskirting", in a local supermarket.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden warned Wednesday of the possibility of an "all-out war" in the Middle East but said he was hopeful a settlement was still achievable for the conflict-torn region.</p>

<p>Biden's comments as he appeared on ABC chat show "The View" came as Israel put troops on alert for possible entry into Lebanon and the war in Gaza grinds on.</p>

<p>"An all-out war is possible," Biden said when asked about the situation. "What I think is, also, the opportunity is still in play to have a settlement that could fundamentally change the whole region."</p>

<p>Biden appeared to raise the possibility of a ceasefire in Lebanon, where Israeli strikes targeting the Hezbollah militia have killed more than 600 people this week.</p>

<p>"They have a possibility -- I don't want to exaggerate it -- there's a possibility if we can deal with a ceasefire in Lebanon that it can move into dealing with the West Bank as well," said Biden.</p>

<p>Israel has been carrying out deadly raids in the occupied West Bank since late August targeting what it says are Palestinian militants.</p>

<p>Biden added however that "we also have Gaza to deal with", as efforts stall to get a ceasefire deal to end Israel's war on Hamas in Gaza after the group's October 7 attacks.</p>

<p>"But it's possible and I'm using every bit of energy with my team to get this done. There's a desire to see change in the region," he said.</p>

<p>The US president also pressed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to drop his opposition to an independent Palestinian state to end the crisis.</p>

<p>"I don't agree with his (Netanyahu's) position. There needs to be a two-state solution," Biden told the show's all-women panel, led by US comedian Whoopi Goldberg.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Israel's army chief told troops on Wednesday to be prepared for a "possible entry" into Lebanon as Israeli fighter jets bombarded Hezbollah targets across the border.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel's army chief told soldiers Wednesday to prepare for a possible ground offensive against Hezbollah in Lebanon as US President Joe Biden warned against "all-out war" in the Middle East.</p>

<p>"We are attacking all day, both to prepare the ground for the possibility of your entry, but also to continue striking Hezbollah," Lieutenant General Herzi Halevi told a tank brigade, a statement from the military said as Israeli warplanes conducted hundreds of deadly strikes around Lebanon.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel's military operations against Hezbollah would not stop until northern residents can safely return to their homes.</p>

<p>Israel's warnings came after Hezbollah said it had targeted Israel's Mossad spy agency headquarters on Tel Aviv's outskirts -- the first time it has fired a ballistic missile in almost a year of cross-border clashes sparked by the Gaza war.</p>

<p>Lebanon's health minister said retaliatory Israeli strikes killed 51 people and injured 223, including in mountainous areas outside Hezbollah's traditional strongholds.</p>

<p>Israel said it hit 60 Hezbollah intelligence sites, among hundreds of the group's targets struck across Lebanon.</p>

<p>In Washington, President Biden warned of the possibility of "all-out war" after Israel's troops were put on alert for a possible ground operation.</p>

<p>"An all-out war is possible," Biden told broadcaster ABC.</p>

<p>"What I think is, also, the opportunity is still in play to have a settlement that could fundamentally change the whole region."</p>

<p>Biden added that there was a "possibility" of a Lebanon ceasefire, but "I don't want to exaggerate it".</p>

<p>The United States is Israel's main backer, and Biden said earlier Wednesday a "full-scale war is not in anyone's interest".</p>

<p><strong>Israel calls reservists</strong></p>

<p>Cross-border clashes intensified Wednesday after Israeli raids on Monday killed at least 558 people in the deadliest day of violence in Lebanon since its 1975-90 civil war.</p>

<p>Nour Hamad, a 22-year-old student in the eastern Lebanese city of Baalbek, described living "in a state of terror" all week.</p>

<p>"We spent four or five days without sleep, not knowing if we will wake up in the morning," she said.</p>

<p>In Tel Aviv, sirens sounded following Hezbollah's unprecedented missile launch at dawn.</p>

<p>Tel Aviv resident Hedva Fadlon, 61, told AFP: "The situation is difficult. We feel the pressure and the tension... I don't think anyone in the world would like to live like this."</p>

<p>US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby called Hezbollah's attack on Tel Aviv "deeply concerning", but added there was "still time and space for a diplomatic solution here to de-escalate the tensions and to prevent an all-out war".</p>

<p>The Israeli military said "over 280 Hezbollah" targets had been struck across Lebanon on Wednesday, and added the strikes were ongoing.</p>

<p>"Fighter jets struck 60 terrorist targets belonging to Hezbollah's intelligence directorate," the army said.</p>

<p>It said two reserve brigades were being called up "for operational missions in the northern arena", adding this would "enable the continuation of combat against the Hezbollah terrorist organisation".</p>

<p><strong>Defiant Netanyahu</strong></p>

<p>The UN Security Council said it would hold an emergency meeting on the crisis in New York later Wednesday, as UN chief Antonio Guterres warned the situation was critical.</p>

<p>"We should all be alarmed by the escalation. Lebanon is at the brink," he said.</p>

<p>The UN's International Organization for Migration on Wednesday said 90,000 people had been displaced in Lebanon so far this week.</p>

<p>Among them, "many of the more than 111,000 people displaced since October... are likely to have been secondarily displaced", a statement from the UN's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs added.</p>

<p>Hezbollah on Tuesday confirmed Israel had killed its rocket forces commander Ibrahim Kobeissi in a strike on Beirut.</p>

<p>Netanyahu delayed his departure for New York until Thursday, where he too is due to speak at the General Assembly.</p>

<p>Israel's premier has defied international calls for restraint.</p>

<p>"We will continue to hit Hezbollah... the one who has a missile in his living room and a rocket in his home will not have a home," he vowed on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Iran, Hezbollah's main backer, condemned Israel's raids, with supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei saying the recent killing of Hezbollah commanders would not crush the group.</p>

<p>"Some of the effective and valuable forces of Hezbollah were martyred, which undoubtedly caused damage to Hezbollah, but this was not the sort of damage that could bring the group to its knees," he said.</p>

<p><strong>Elusive ceasefire</strong></p>

<p>While the Israel-Lebanon border has seen near-daily clashes for a year, the violence escalated dramatically last week, when coordinated communications device blasts that Hezbollah blamed on Israel killed 39 people and wounded almost 3,000.</p>

<p>Then Israel carried out an air strike on Hezbollah's south Beirut stronghold, killing a top military commander and other fighters and civilians.</p>

<p>Efforts to end the war in Gaza, which analysts say are key to stopping the escalation in Lebanon, have yet to make progress.</p>

<p>Netanyahu has been accused by critics of stalling in Gaza ceasefire negotiations and prolonging the war to appease far-right coalition partners.</p>

<p>The war in Gaza began with Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel, which resulted in the deaths of 1,205 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures that include hostages killed in captivity.</p>

<p>Of the 251 hostages seized by Hamas operatives, 97 are still held in Gaza, including 33 the Israeli military says are dead.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory military offensive has killed at least 41,495 people in Gaza, most of them civilians, according to figures provided by the Hamas-run territory's health ministry. The UN has described the figures as reliable.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Asserting that the United Nations remains a "prisoner" of the past, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar said countries of the Global South cannot continue to be "short-changed" and their proper representation in the permanent category in a reformed UN Security Council is a "particular imperative".</p>

<p>Mr Jaishankar made these remarks at the 2nd Foreign Ministers meeting of G20 Brasil 2024 on the theme 'Building a just world and a sustainable planet'.</p>

<p>"The world has evolved into a smart, interconnected and multipolar arena and its members have increased fourfold since the UN's inception. Yet the UN remains a prisoner of the past," Mr Jaishankar said.</p>

<p>He said that as a result, the UN Security Council struggles to fulfil its mandate of maintaining international peace and stability, undermining its effectiveness and credibility.</p>

<p>Addressing the event in the UN Headquarters Wednesday, Mr Jaishankar said that "without reforms, including expansion in both categories of UNSC membership," the lack of effectiveness of the 15-nation body will only continue.</p>

<p>"Expansion and proper representation in the permanent category is a particular imperative. Asia, Africa and Latin America - the Global South - cannot continue to be short-changed," he said adding that they must be given their legitimate voice.</p>

<p>Mr Jaishankar emphasised that real change needs to happen and happen fast.</p>

<p>India has been at the forefront of years-long efforts calling for reform of the Security Council, including expansion in both its permanent and non-permanent categories, saying the 15-nation Council, founded in 1945, is not fit for purpose in the 21st Century and does not reflect contemporary geo-political realities.</p>

<p>Delhi has underscored that it rightly deserves a permanent seat at the horse-shoe table.</p>

<p>India last sat at the UN high table as a non-permanent member in 2021-22. A polarised Security Council has also failed to deal with current peace and security challenges with Council members sharply divided on conflicts such as the Ukraine war and the Israel-Hamas conflict.</p>

<p>UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has also noted that the United Nations had 51 Member States when it was established nearly 80 years ago, and today it is made up of 193 nations.</p>

<p>The UN chief warned that the 15-nation United Nations Security Council, which he has described as "outdated" and whose authority is eroding, will eventually lose all credibility unless its composition and working methods are reformed. The UN chief has given a clarion call that "we can't build a future for our grandchildren with a system built for our grandparents."&nbsp;</p>

<p>On reform of the multilateral trading system, Mr Jaishankar said India remains unwavering in its commitment to rules-based, non-discriminatory, fair, open, inclusive, equitable and transparent multilateral trading system, with the World Trade Organisation (WTO) at its core.</p>

<p>Delhi strongly supports policies that foster trade and investment, enabling every nation to flourish in an interconnected and dynamic world, he said.</p>

<p>He said that to foster a favourable trade and investment environment, "we must ensure a truly level playing field and fair competition. Market distorting practices and protectionism must be firmly discouraged," he said.</p>

<p>India calls for comprehensive reform of the WTO to enhance its functions through an inclusive, member-driven and transparent process.</p>

<p>"It remains committed to constructive discussions for realising a fully operational and effective dispute settlement system accessible by all members.</p>

<p>He stressed that a reformed and fair multilateral trading system is vital for "our future to be more equitable and inclusive." "It demands bold, transformative action. The world looks to the G20 In that regard," he said.</p>

<p>Presenting India's views on key areas of global governance reform, Mr Jaishankar highlighted the need for reform of the international financial architecture.</p>

<p>"The Bretton Woods institutions have to now focus on urgent issues dictated by persistent development challenges and pressing climate change," he said adding that neither the multilateral development banks (MDBs) nor the orthodox global financial system were designed to handle that.</p>

<p>He said that financing and investment gaps for the Sustainable Development Goals, estimated at up to USD 4 trillion annually, need to be addressed urgently.</p>

<p>He stressed that as key anchors of the global development financing landscape, MDBs must be made more robust, expansive and effective.</p>

<p>He recalled that significant strides were made during India's G20 presidency, with G20 leaders having called for expanding development in climate finance from billions to trillions.</p>

<p>Brazil's presidency of the grouping has continued that momentum, Mr Jaishankar said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Chinese People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) reportedly operated its three aircraft carriers for exercises or tests over the past week for the first time. The show of "strength" by the PLAN comes ahead of the 12th anniversary of the commissioning of its first aircraft carrier, Liaoning.</p>

<p>China has commissioned two aircraft carriers - Liaoning and Shandong - the former is a Soviet-era aircraft carrier which China commissioned in 2012 and the latter is its first domestically built carrier. The third aircraft carrier, Fujian, is China's largest and most advanced aircraft carrier ever built with a potent aircraft launching system. Fujian underwent sea trials and is yet to be commissioned.</p>

<p>The Global Times, the mouthpiece of the Chinese Communist Party, reported, that China's aircraft carrier program has entered a fast lane. The Liaoning aircraft carrier conducted routine exercises in water including the West Pacific, to enhance combat capabilities, Senior Colonel Zhang Xiaogang, spokesperson of the Chinese Ministry of National Defense said.</p>

<p>Each carrier follows a deployment cycle, only a small part of which is spent on the station. When not on station, the ship is in one of three other phases: in transit to or from the operating area, in its home port for maintenance, crew rest, and shore training or at sea for short periods of crew training or operations when not deployed</p>

<p>Both conventionally powered and nuclear-powered carriers undergo several deployment cycles within one operating cycle, which is the time between complex overhauls (periods of major maintenance).</p>

<h2><strong>Type 001</strong></h2>

<p>The Liaoning aircraft carrier (Type 001) was spotted north of Taiwan and near Japan. The Japanese Ministry of Defence said they detected the Chinese navy's movement in its economic waters - a maritime area that extends 200 nautical miles beyond its territorial sea. An aircraft carrier is accompanied by warships and the group is called Carrier Battle Group (CBG). Japan said the group sailed from the East China Sea, passing between the Yonaguni and Iriomote islands - both under Japan - toward the Philippine Sea.</p>

<p>The Global Times said the group hosted takeoffs and landings of fighter jets and helicopters in the waters southeast of Miyako Islands. The islands are part of the First Island Chain a geopolitically important boundary for the US, with vast amounts of natural resources and economic significance. It is also called the first line of defence for the US west of the Pacific.</p>

<p>This is the first time Chinese warships have entered Japan's contiguous waters, which it said was "completely unacceptable". Territorial waters are different from a country's Exclusive Economic Zone. &nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Type 002</strong></h2>

<p>Shangdong aircraft carrier (Type 002) recently hosted a certification test for night-time operation for a group of new fighter jet pilots during a combat exercise in the South China Sea, the state-run CCTV reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The exercise aimed to improve its "round-the-clock" all-domain combat capabilities, as more fighter jets are capable of being operated on aircraft carriers, CCTV reported.</p>

<h2><strong>Type 003</strong></h2>

<p>Meanwhile, the third aircraft carrier was to sea for the fourth time on September 3 to conduct sea trials, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.newsweek.com/pacific-news-map-us-china-news-aircraft-carriers-september-20-2024-1956710" rel="no follow, no index">Newsweek</a> reported. Fujian took to the seas for its maiden trials in May this year.</p>

<p>Fujian was in the Bohai Sea. The satellite imagery spotted the warship conducting a replenishment test on Tuesday. The aircraft carrier departed from Shanghai's Jiangnan Shipyard for sea trials, with expected arrival in Shanghai on Saturday as it was in the Yellow Sea, making its way down south, Newsweek reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="ins_instory_dv_caption"><em>Fujian aircraft carrier</em></p>
</div>

<p>The Fujian carrier (Type 003) weighs 79,000 tons, carrying the most potent fighter jet launch system - the Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System (EMALS). Currently, the USS Gerald R Ford, the world's largest aircraft carrier, uses the EMALS launch system. The EMALS catapult offers more smooth, accurate launching of an aircraft carrier, allowing heavier fighter jets to take off. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The US Department of Defence, in its latest report on Chinese naval modernization, said China is reportedly building a fourth aircraft carrier similar to Fujian and is expected to be nuclear-powered. The Fujian aircraft carrier will be the first conventional-energy-powered platform with the EMALS system.</p>

<p>China wants its navy to be able to deter "US intervention in a conflict in China's near-seas region over Taiwan or some other issue, or failing that, delay the arrival or reduce the effectiveness of intervening US forces," a Congressional Research Service report said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has called for an urgent meeting of Moscow's top security council to discuss its nuclear deterrence. The move comes amid rising concerns in Russia over Ukraine being allowed by Western powers to use cruise missiles to target locations deep inside Russia.</p>

<p>Last week the UK reportedly cleared the use of its 'Storm Shadow' cruise missile to be used to bomb Russia. UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer even flew to Washington DC to meet US President Joe Biden. The two leaders reportedly discussed Ukraine's use of weapons on Russian soil.</p>

<p>The Russian intelligence had information about such a possibility and had said earlier this month that "It has become necessary for Moscow to revise its nuclear doctrine because of the West's escalation of the war in Ukraine."</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2023-05/dvsfo8vg_storm-shadow-long-range-missiles_625x300_13_May_23.jpg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said that Mr Putin will meet the most powerful officials in his administration to discuss the war strategy going forward. "There will be a speech by the President," Mr Peskov said, adding that "The rest, for obvious reasons, will be marked 'top secret'."</p>

<p>Speaking about the reports that the United States and United Kingdom are about to give clearance to Ukraine for Kyiv to launch cruise missiles on Russian soil, President Putin said this month that, "The West would be directly fighting with Russia if it gave such permission to Ukraine (to bomb Russia)" adding that Moscow would be forced to make "appropriate decisions" in such a scenario.</p>

<h2><strong>RUSSIA'S NUCLEAR DOCTRINE &amp; TREATY WITH US</strong></h2>

<p>Russia is the world's largest nuclear power. Together, Russia and the United States control 88% of the world's nuclear weapons.</p>

<p>Russia's current nuclear doctrine was set in place by Vladimir Putin four years ago, before the war with Ukraine broke out. According to the current doctrine, Russia may use nuclear weapons in the scenario where it comes under a nuclear attack or if a conventional attack threatens the existence of the state.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-09/im09u9j8_russian-yars-intercontinental-ballistic-missile-system-reuters_625x300_25_September_24.jpg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>President Putin, who is the primary decision maker on Russia's massive nuclear arsenal, is now planning how to respond if the United States and its European allies allow Ukraine to use Western-supplied missiles to strike deep inside Russia.</p>

<p>The United States and Russia have a nuclear treaty called the US-Russia New START Treaty, which entered into force on February 5, 2011.</p>

<p>Under the treaty, the United States and the Russian Federation had seven years to meet the treaty's central limits on strategic offensive arms (by February 5, 2018) and are then obligated to maintain those limits for as long as the treaty remains in force.</p>

<p>According to the US State Department, this treaty enhances US national security by placing verifiable limits on all Russian deployed intercontinental-range nuclear weapons. The United States and the Russian Federation have agreed to extend the treaty through February 4, 2026.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-09/j4c9ihng_us-medium-range-ballistic-missile-launch-test-reuters_625x300_25_September_24.jpg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>According to a Reuters report, the Kremlin said that any discussions about a replacement to the US-Russia New START Treaty, which expires in 2026, would need to take into account European nuclear potential - shorthand for the arsenals of Britain and France.</p>

<p>"We have not yet received a response from the Americans to this, but of course an agreement is needed and negotiations should begin as soon as possible," Peskov said when asked about a possible replacement for the New START Treaty.</p>

<h3><strong>THE STORM SHADOW MISSILE</strong></h3>

<p>Ukraine already has the UK-supplied Storm Shadow missile, but uses it only within its territory to combat Russian forces.</p>

<p>So far, there are restriction on Ukraine on the use of advanced western weaponry on targets within the Russian territory, but this is likely to change with clearances reportedly being issued by the UK, with US backing it.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-09/dit2seng_storm-shadow-missile-ukraine_625x300_12_September_24.jpeg?im=FeatureCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=1200,height=738" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>The Storm Shadow is a low-observable, long-range air-launched cruise missile. It is jointly developed by the United Kingdom and France and has a range of around 500 km. It has already been integrated into Ukrainian fighter aircraft, including the Russia-built Su-24 bombers - a legacy of the past, from when Ukraine was part of the erstwhile Soviet Union.</p>

</div>

<p>Developed in 1994 and manufactured by Matra and British Aerospace, the Storm Shadow missile is now made by MBDA Systems. 'Storm Shadow' is the weapon's British name, while in France it is called the SCALP-EG.</p>

<h3><strong>RUSSIAN NUCLEAR WEAPONS STOCKPILE</strong></h3>

<p>Should Ukraine use cruise missiles to attack Russian territory, a Russian response to this could be massive. The international worry is that Moscow may seriously consider the use of nuclear weapons in such a scenario.</p>

<p>According to Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation - a nonpartisan non-profit organisation on nuclear weapons disarmament - Russia maintains a stockpile of an estimated 6,372 nuclear warheads - the world's largest.</p>

<p>Of these, 1,572 of which are deployed on strategic land-based ballistic missiles, submarine-launched ballistic missiles, and heavy bombers. Approximately 870 more strategic warheads and 1,870 non-strategic warheads are in reserve with an additional estimated 2,060 warheads awaiting dismantlement.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>No city or village in certain areas has been spared in the Israeli strikes on Lebanon in which over 500 civilians, including 50 children have been killed, a resident of Beirut has told NDTV, claiming that citizens of the country are standing resolutely with Hezbollah.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Syed Ali Bakir said several areas have seen continuous bombing and structures have been reduced to ruins.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"There were pager attacks initially, followed by walkie-talkie explosions and then missiles in which many from Hezbollah lost their lives. On Monday, Israel began a fresh wave of attacks in which civilians are dying. Approximately 600 common people have been killed and between 1,800 and 2,000 have been injured. In certain areas, no city or village has been spared. No supermarket, medical store or hospital has been spared," he said in Hindi.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To a question on whether the people were supporting Hezbollah or just wanted peace, Mr Bakir said the entire civilian population is standing shoulder-to-shoulder with the group.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"There are queues to donate blood. Some people are even saying that they have two eyes and are willing to donate one or they have two kidneys and are willing to donate one. That is the kind of spirit we are seeing. There is a passion and enthusiasm in this community. Such a people can never lose to any enemy," he claimed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Speaking to NDTV on Tuesday, Israeli envoy to India Reuven Azar said most of the 1,700 military targets that Israel targeted in southern Lebanon in the past 48 hours were "embedded" in the homes of civilians and the families did not evacuate on time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"(This was) despite the fact that we called them over the phone, we intercepted radio communications... we tried every way possible to take them out of harm's way. Despite that, &nbsp;yes, there were some civilians that were killed as well. But when you look at the magnitude of this - 1,700 military targets in 48 hours - you will see that, actually, this has been very successful; because at the end of the day, when you compare the damage that would be caused from these missiles to Israeli civilians to the price that the people have to pay, it's a relatively low price," he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mr Azar said every loss of life is tragic and claimed that Israel does whatever is possible to take civilians out of harm's way.</p>

<p><strong>23 More Killed</strong></p>

<p>Lebanon said 23 people were killed and several injured on Wednesday, the third day of major Israeli strikes. Hezbollah has said it fired a ballistic missile that reached the key Israeli city of Tel Aviv for the first time, before being intercepted, news agency AFP reported.</p>

<p>The Israeli military also said it is calling up two reserve brigades to its northern border. "The IDF (Israel Defense Forces) is calling up two reserve brigades for operational missions in the northern arena... to enable the continuation of combat against the Hezbollah terrorist organisation," it said in a statement.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Lou recounted how her supervisor demanded she bring her a hot Americano and an egg every morning, as well as keep a bottle of water readily available.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A woman in Shanghai, identified by her surname Lou, was briefly fired from her job at an educational institution after refusing to purchase breakfast for her boss, sparking widespread outrage on mainland social media. According to the <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scmp.com/news/people-culture/trending-china/article/3279487/outrage-after-china-firm-fires-woman-refusing-buy-breakfast-boss-results-reinstatement?module=top_story&amp;pgtype=section">South China Morning Post,</a></em> Lou shared her experience on Xiaohongshu, recounting how her supervisor, Liu, demanded she bring her a hot Americano and an egg every morning, as well as keep a bottle of water readily available. When Lou addressed these unreasonable demands in a work chat group, she was reprimanded and subsequently fired by the human resources department without compensation.</p>

<p>However, following public backlash, the company reinstated Lou and terminated Liu for abusing her authority and coercing subordinates into assisting her with personal matters. The company's HR head, Wang, clarified that Lou's termination was Liu's decision and not aligned with company policy.&nbsp;Though she has resumed work again, it is uncertain whether she will receive any compensation.</p>

<p>The incident has highlighted the pervasive issue of workplace bullying in China, with related discussions attracting over 2 million views on Weibo. A 2020 survey by Zhilian Zhaopin revealed that 64% of respondents experienced workplace bullying, commonly in the form of forced task completion, verbal abuse, and sexual harassment. Over half of those bullied chose to resign, while 6% turned to social media to expose the issue.</p>

<p>Chinese law does not explicitly define workplace bullying, and penalties vary. Lawyer He Bo advised employees to gather evidence, such as screenshots and recordings, to protect themselves. He emphasised that employees have the right to refuse unreasonable work requests and seek legal counsel if necessary.</p>

<p>He told SCMP, ''For instance, forcing employees to work overtime violates labour laws, and sexual harassment can result in administrative or criminal liability for the offenders. In combating workplace bullying, employees should gather evidence such as screenshots, audio recordings, and video.''</p>

<p>Lou's experience has sparked a national conversation about workplace bullying, with many praising her bravery in speaking out. One user wrote, ''This boss treated her subordinate like a free assistant, which is unethical and constitutes bullying.''</p>

<p>Another commented, ''Lou displayed significant bravery by exposing her boss's misconduct.''</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A South Korean vlogger has courted controversy after claiming that she terminated her pregnancy at nine months. According to <em>CNN</em>, the woman, whose identity hasn't been revealed, is being investigated for murder in a case that has prompted horror in South Korea. The case has raised urgent questions about the abortion laws in South Korea as there are no laws governing when, where, or how abortions can take place.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/20/asia/south-korea-abortion-youtube-video-intl-hnk/index.html" rel="noindex, nofollow"><em>CNN</em></a>, the Seoul National Police began investigating the woman in July at the request of the South Korean government after she posted a video to YouTube purportedly documenting her experience of getting an abortion, cops said.</p>

<p>Notably, abortions past 24 weeks are banned in many jurisdictions, or reserved for very exceptional cases. However, in South Korea, there are no laws governing when, where or how abortions can take place. But this was not always the case. For the last four years, there has been a policy vacuum. Before this, strict laws governing the medical procedure made abortion a crime punishable by up to two years in prison. It only limited exceptions for rape, incest, and a threat to the life, health of the mother or the baby.</p>

<p>It was in 2019 that South Korea's Constitutional Court overturned the ban, giving the National Assembly until the end of 2020 to enact new abortion laws, which the court recommended should include a term limit of 22 weeks. When the legislature failed to meet that deadline, the criminal provisions around abortion expired, effectively legalising abortion at any stage of pregnancy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In June, in a statement posted to its website, South Korea's Ministry of Justice said that "the direction, details, and timing of the revision" of the country's abortion laws is yet to be decided, and that it needs to consult with the Health and Welfare Ministry - which oversees the Maternal and Child Health Act.</p>

<p>"The Ministry of Justice will do its best to discuss the issue so that the right to life of the fetus, and the right to health and the right to self-determination of the pregnant woman can be harmonised," it added.</p>

<p>This policy vacuum experts say not only opens the door to potential malpractice but also hinders access to safe abortions. By not passing abortion laws, the National Assembly is "not doing its job," said Cho Hee-kyoung, a law professor at Hongik University in Seoul. "If there is no law criminalizing a conduct, then there is no crime for carrying out that conduct," Cho said.</p>

<p>Experts also say that in the absence of clear regulations, women and abortion providers currently operate in a grey area with little guidance as to what is permitted and what might break other laws. Credible information about where to get an abortion is hard to come by, and the procedure is not covered under the country's public health system, the outlet reported.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Four men of Indian origin were on Wednesday charged with causing public nuisance and using abusive language against a police officer in Singapore's Little Precinct.</p>

<p>A nearly two-minute video of the four abusing the police officer at a crime scene cordoned off to investigate an alleged murder on Sunday morning in Little India, was uploaded on the Facebook page ROADS.sg, Channel News Asia reported.</p>

<p>The post featuring Md Dino Marciano Abdul Wahab, 44, Alex Kumar Gnansekaran, 37, Mohamed Eusof Mohamed Yahiya, 32, and Mohanan V Balakrishnan, 32, shouting at police officers garnered more than 423,000 views in three days.</p>

<p>Court documents said they allegedly used phrases such as "You talked like a gangster, you know, we all scared, you know", "We are paying tax, we are paying our ****ing tax", and "I can show you 100 per cent gangster".</p>

<p>The incident took place in the back lane of Sam Leong Road in Little India, where an alleged murder had taken place.</p>

<p>The case involved Indian-origin Muhammad Sajid Saleem, 22, who was on Monday charged with the murder of a 25-year-old along Verdun Road. Another five men were also charged concerning the incident.</p>

<p>However, the four men charged on Wednesday are unrelated to the murder. They told the court they intended to seek legal representation.</p>

<p>The police prosecutor told the court that investigations were ongoing and the four men might face additional charges. They will be back in court on October 8.</p>

<p>The police in a statement said officers were preserving "a murder crime scene" at about 5.10 am on Sunday when the four men approached.</p>

<p>They allegedly tried to cross the cordoned-off area but were advised to use an alternative route.</p>

<p>"Three of the men then allegedly taunted and used abusive language against the officers, while the fourth man purportedly filmed the interactions with his mobile phone," said the police.</p>

<p>"Despite the four men's behaviour, the officers exercised restraint and strived to de-escalate the situation even as they were trying to manage the ongoing murder investigation." The four men used the alternative route "only after much persuasion", said the police.</p>

<p>The police said they would not hesitate to take action against persons who obstruct public servants carrying out their duties, and against those who use abusive behaviour towards their officers.</p>

<p>Any person found guilty of using abusive language against a public servant can be jailed for up to a year, fined up to SGD 5,000 (USD 3,900) or both.</p>

<p>Those found guilty of causing public nuisance face a jail term of up to three months, a fine of up to SGD 2,000 (USD 1,557) or both.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

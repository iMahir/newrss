       <description><![CDATA[The Middle East has been in turmoil since Iran-backed group Hamas attacked Israel on October 7 sparking war in Gaza and drawing in Iranian allies around the region.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iran unveiled a new ballistic missile and an upgraded one-way attack drone at a military parade on Saturday, state media said, amid soaring regional tensions and allegations of arming Russia. Iran stands accused by Western governments of supplying both drones and missiles to Russia for use in its war with Ukraine, a charge it has repeatedly denied.</p>

<p>The solid-fuel Jihad missile was designed and manufactured by the aerospace arm of Iran's Revolutionary Guards and has an operational range of 1,000 kilometres (more than 600 miles), state news agency IRNA said.</p>

<p>The Shahed-136B drone is an upgraded version of the Shahed-136, with new features and an operational range of more than 4,000 kilometres (2,500 miles), it added.</p>

<p>New President Masoud Pezeshkian attended the annual parade in Tehran, commemorating the 1980-88 war with Saddam Hussein's Iraq.</p>

<p>"Today, our defensive and deterrent capabilities have grown so much that no demon even thinks about any aggression towards our dear Iran," he said.</p>

<p>"With unity and cohesion among Islamic countries... we can put in its place the bloodthirsty, genocidal usurper Israel, which shows no mercy to anyone, women or children, old or young."</p>

<p>The Middle East has been in turmoil since Iran-backed Palestinian group Hamas attacked Israel on October 7 sparking war in Gaza and drawing in Iranian allies around the region.</p>

<p>The tensions have intensified in recent days as the focus of Israel's firepower has shifted north to the Lebanon border where its troops have been battling the Iran-backed group Hezbollah.</p>

<p>An Israeli air strike on Hezbollah's Beirut stronghold killed 16 members of its elite Radwan Force on Friday, a source close to the group said, hot on the heels of deadly sabotage attacks on the group's communications earlier this week.</p>

<p>Britain, France, Germany, and the United States slapped new sanctions on Iran earlier this month, alleging that it had been providing ballistic missiles for Russia's war effort in Ukraine.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The bodies of Suzanne Armstrong, 27, and Susan Bartlett, 28, were discovered at their house in Easey Street, Melbourne, on January 13, 1977, with multiple stab wounds.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 65-year-old man has been arrested in Rome over the "horrific, frenzied" 1977 murder of two women in their home in Melbourne, Australian police said Saturday. The bodies of Suzanne Armstrong, 27, and Susan Bartlett, 28, were discovered at their house in Easey Street, Melbourne, on January 13, 1977, with multiple stab wounds.</p>

<p>Armstrong had been raped. Her then 16-month-old son was found unharmed in his cot.</p>

<p>The women had last been seen alive three days earlier.</p>

<p>"It was an absolutely gruesome, horrific, frenzied homicide -- multiple stabbings," Victoria Police Chief Commissioner Shane Patton told a news conference.</p>

<p>He described the 47-year-old crime, known as the Easey Street murders, as the state's longest and most serious cold case.</p>

<p>The suspect, a dual Greek-Australian citizen, had been living in Greece where he was protected by the country's statute of limitations, Patton said.</p>

<p>Police waited for him to leave the country, the chief commissioner added, and he was finally arrested Thursday in the Italian capital's Fiumicino airport under an Interpol red notice.</p>

<p>Australia will launch extradition procedures, he said.</p>

<p>Police had been helped by "technological advances" over the years, Patton said.</p>

<p>In 2017, they offered an Aus$1 million (US$680,000) reward for information leading to an arrest and conviction, he said, after new information had come to light.</p>

<p>He declined to give more details of the investigation.</p>

<p>A report in Melbourne's The Age newspaper, which police did not confirm, said police had decided to check the DNA of all 131 people named in the original police file.</p>

<p>The suspect was on that list and had agreed to undergo a DNA test but instead fled to Greece in 2017, the paper reported.</p>

<p>He was linked to the crime by the DNA of a close relative, it said.</p>

<p>According to The Age, the suspect had been stopped and searched on the night of the murders by local police who found a large knife on him -- three days before the bodies were discovered.</p>

<p>It is "understood" that the man -- then a teenager -- was not interviewed about the killings at the time as police focused on other suspects, the paper said.</p>

<p>A detective senior sergeant running the investigation since 2015 broke the news of the suspect's arrest to the victims' families on Saturday morning, Patton said.</p>

<p>The families were "emotional, speechless, overwhelmed, but appreciative that they hadn't been forgotten", he said.</p>

<p>"There is simply no expiry date on crimes that are as brutal as this. I think that is borne out here today."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">A polar bear that made a rare appearance outside a cottage in a remote Icelandic village was shot by police after being deemed a threat to local residents. The bear was killed on September 19 in northwest Iceland after consultation with the Environment Agency, which opted against relocating the animal</p>

<p>“It's not something we like to do,” Westfjords police chief Helgi Jensson was quoted as saying by <a href="https://apnews.com/article/polar-bear-shot-iceland-policy-greenland-ice-0d3badd4b7f5e320d992ce7f0dc600fd">AP,</a> adding that the bear was very close to a summer house. “There was an old woman in there.” The woman, who was alone at the time, locked herself upstairs in fear as the bear rummaged through her garbage. She contacted her daughter in Reykjavik for assistance via satellite link.</p>

<p>“She stayed there,” Jensson said, adding that other summer residents had already left the area. “She knew the danger.”</p>

<p>Polar bears are not native to Iceland but sometimes drift ashore from Greenland on ice floes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The bear shot on September 19 was the first sighted in Iceland since 2016, with only 600 recorded sightings since the ninth century. The bear, estimated to weigh between 150 and 200 kilograms, will be taken to the Icelandic Institute of Natural History for further study, said the report. Scientists plan to examine the bear for parasites and infections, assess its organ health and body fat percentage, and potentially preserve its pelt and skull for the institute's collection.</p>

<p>Although polar bears are a protected species in the country, authorities may take lethal action if they pose a threat to humans or livestock, according to the AP report.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While attacks on humans by polar bears are extremely rare, a study published in the <a href="https://wildlife.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/wsb.783">Wildlife Society Bulletin in 2017 </a>said that the loss of sea ice due to climate change has led to more hungry bears venturing onto land, raising the risk of human encounters. The study revealed that from 1870 to 2014, there were 73 documented attacks by wild polar bears across the five polar bear Range States — Canada, Greenland, Norway, Russia and the United States — leading to 20 fatalities and 63 injuries among humans.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[The meeting of the Quad - a grouping of India, the US, Australia and Japan- comes at an important time amid an escalation between Israel and Hezbollah and the ongoing Russia-Ukraine and Israel-Hamas wars.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<ol>
	<li>Prime Minister Narendra Modi will land in Philadelphia around 10 am local time (7.30 pm IST) and then head to US President Joe Biden's hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, where the two leaders will hold bilateral discussions. Apart from the relationship between the two countries, PM Modi's visits to Russia and Ukraine and a possible peace process are also likely to be discussed.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>An announcement may be made about the India-US space collaboration, under which Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla will be travelling to the International Space Station as part of the Axiom-4 mission. A multi-billion dollar deal in which India plans to acquire 31 predator drones from the US will also be discussed, but it is not clear whether the announcement will happen during the PM's visit.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>After the bilateral, PM Modi will attend the Quad summit with Mr Biden, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida. White House Spokesperson John Kirby has said China will be high on the agenda. "In fact, it would be irresponsible if they didn't talk about the challenges that still exist in the region caused by aggressive People's Republic of China military action... for instance, unfair trade practices, tensions over the Taiwan Strait... I have no doubt that that all those issues will come up," he has said.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>On Day 2 of his visit, Prime Minister Modi will address a gathering of the Indian community in New York and interact with CEOs of leading companies. Collaboration in cutting-edge areas of artificial intelligence, quantum computing biotechnology and semiconductors will be discussed.</li>
	<li>Day 3 will see the Prime Minister addressing the 'Summit of the Future' at the United Nations General Assembly in New York on September 23. The theme of the summit is 'Multilateral Solutions for a Better Tomorrow' and UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres has called it a 'once in a generation UN Summit'.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>PM Modi is also likely to hold bilateral discussions with some other world leaders on the sidelines of the UN summit.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Former US president Donald Trump, locked in a close contest with Vice President Kamala Harris ahead of the presidential polls in November, has said he will be meeting Prime Minister Modi, whom he called "a fantastic man". The foreign ministry has not, however, confirmed that the meeting will take place.</li>
	<li>In his departure statement, PM Modi said, "I look forward to joining my colleagues President Biden, Prime Minister Albanese and Prime Minister Kishida for the Quad Summit. The forum has emerged as a key group of like-minded countries to work for peace, progress and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region."&nbsp;</li>
	<li>The PM said his bilateral with President Biden will allow the two leaders to identify new pathways to further deepen the India-US partnership. Stressing the importance of the UN summit, he said, "The Summit of the Future is an opportunity for the global community to chart the road ahead for the betterment of humanity. I will share the views of one-sixth of humanity as their stakes in a peaceful and secure future are among the highest in the world."</li>
	<li>The PM also said he was looking forward to engaging with the Indian community in the US as well as important American business leaders, who are "key stakeholders and provide vibrancy to the unique partnership between the largest and the oldest democracies of the world."</li>

       <description><![CDATA[Olivia Nuzzi, a political reporter for the New York Magazine, recently admitted to her editors that she was engaged in a relationship with former US presidential candidate Robert F Kennedy Jr.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Olivia Nuzzi, a political reporter for the New York Magazine, has been placed on leave as a “third-party review” is being conducted after the disclosure of her personal relationship with former US presidential candidate Robert F Kennedy Jr.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Nuzzi, the Washington correspondent of the magazine, recently admitted to her editors that she was engaged in a relationship “with a former subject relevant to the 2024 campaign while she was reporting on the campaign,” according to a statement by the news outlet on Thursday.</p>

<p dir="ltr">It also said Nuzzi, who has written extensive long-form pieces about US politics, including RFK Jr, violated the magazine's standards around disclosing conflicts of interests</p>

<p dir="ltr">The magazine stated that after reviewing her work, it did not find any "inaccuracies nor evidence of bias,” adding that she is "currently on leave from the magazine, and the magazine is conducting a more thorough third-party review”.</p>

<p dir="ltr">In a note to the staff members, David Haskell, the editor of New York magazine, stated that Olivia Nuzzi opened up about her relationship a few days ago, stating that it started in December 2023 and came to an end in August.</p>

<p dir="ltr">In a statement to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/20/business/media/olivia-nuzzi-rfk-jr.html" rel="nofollow,noindex">The New York Times</a>, Olivia Nuzzi said that “some communication between myself and a former reporting subject turned personal”.</p>

<p dir="ltr">“The relationship was never physical but should have been disclosed to prevent the appearance of a conflict. I deeply regret not doing so immediately and apologize to those I've disappointed, especially my colleagues at New York," she said.</p>

<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>Who is Olivia Nuzzi?</strong></h3>

<p dir="ltr">Born on January 6, 1993, in New York City, Olivia Nuzzi grew up in Middletown Township, New Jersey.</p>

<p dir="ltr">After completing her graduation from Middletown High School South, she went on to attend Fordham University. However, she reportedly dropped out of it after getting a full-time offer from The Daily Beast in 2014.</p>

<p dir="ltr">At the age of 20, Nuzzi interned for Anthony Weiner's New York City mayoral campaign. During the same time, she was hired by NSFWcorp as a staff writer and wrote about her experiences in a blog post.</p>

<p dir="ltr">While working for The Daily Beast she covered the presidential campaigns of Chris Christie and Rand Paul, besides former US president Donald Trump's ascent into politics.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Politico had in 2016 named her as one of the "16 Breakout Media Stars", while Forbes mentioned her in its "30 Under 30" list in 2018.</p>

<p dir="ltr">She was hired as the Washington correspondent for New York magazine in February 2017. In November last year, she worked on a profile of Kennedy, besides writing other features.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Olivia Nuzzi got engaged to Politico's chief Washington correspondent Ryan Lizza in 2022.</p>

<p dir="ltr">After Nuzzi's alleged relationship with Kennedy, Lizza in a note to readers said, "Because of my connection to this story through my ex-fiancee, my editors and I have agreed that I won't be involved in any coverage of Kennedy in Playbook or elsewhere at POLITICO".</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's arrival in the US for the Quad Summit, US President Joe Biden hosted Australian PM Anthony Albanese for a one-on-one meeting at his Delaware house on Friday.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">PM Modi will attend the weekend summit with the Quad group– Australia, US and Japan. He is on a three-day visit to the US, the first after securing a third consecutive term.</p>

<p dir="ltr">US President Biden has opted for his hometown of Wilmington–around 170 kilometres from Washington– to host the farewell summit for Quad leaders.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">Post the one-on-one meeting with Albanese at his property on Friday night, Biden will now welcome the PM Modi as well as Japanese PM Fumio Kishida at his house on Saturday, AFP reported.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Thereafter, he will host an "intimate" dinner as well and a full four-way summit at his former high school in the city, the report added.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The Quad summit will be the last major event of Biden's presidency as the 81-year-old opted out from the November 5 US presidential elections against former president Donald Trump, handing the Democratic campaign reins to US Vice President Kamala Harris.</p>

<p dir="ltr">US Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said this will be the first time when Biden will host foreign leaders in his hometown as President, adding that it is "a reflection of his deep personal relationships with each of the Quad Leaders".</p>

<p dir="ltr">The White House noted that Kamala Harris is not expected to attend the meeting.</p>

<p dir="ltr">During their Friday meeting, Biden and Albanese discussed diplomacy with China, besides sharing concerns about the country's "coercive and destabilising activities," an official statement said.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Over the years, the US President has heavily pushed the Quad grouping, which was formed in 2007 as part of the emphasis on international alliances, the report stated.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>What's on PM Modi's agenda?</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">In the US, apart from the Quad summit, PM Modi will address the 'Summit of the Future' at the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) in New York, besides holding a roundtable with CEOs of major American firms that are working in the tech sector.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Taking about the Quad Summit, PM Modi in his departure statement on Saturday said, "The forum has emerged as a key group of like-minded countries to work for peace, progress and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region."</p>

<p dir="ltr">He noted that his meeting his Biden will allow them to review and identify new pathways for further deepening the India-US Comprehensive Global Strategic Partnership for the benefit of the people and global good.</p>

<p dir="ltr">India will be hosting the next Quad Summit in 2025.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Moo Deng -- whose name in Thai means "bouncy pork", a popular snack -- is now an unwitting poster child for the endangered pygmy hippo.</p>

<p>The fame has not gone to Moo Deng's head, as she sticks close to her mother, sharing a meal of carrots, bananas, corn and runner beans.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Native to West Africa, the pygmy hippo is threatened by human activities, such as logging, mining and poaching, and there are only 2,000 to 2,500 left in the world, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature.</p>

<p>Hundreds of visitors queued at the zoo for five minutes in the enclosure.</p>

<p>One group said they woke up at 5:00 am to make the two-hour drive from Bangkok to see the celebrity.</p>

<p>A visitor said she hoped more Thais would come and "post about Moo Deng online so that more people will come to see her".</p>

<p>Moo Deng's caretaker and social media manager Atthapon Nundee, 31, said the rise of short-form videos has turbocharged the pygmi hippo's fame and hopes it will be a boon for biodiversity preservation.</p>

<p>"With more and more images of pygmy hippos online, more people fell in love with them. They are poached in the wild, so with more people caring about them, it might prevent their poaching," he told AFP.</p>

<p>A 2022 study published by the Royal Society of Canada's Academy of Science shows that social media can play both positive and negative roles in wildlife conservation.</p>

<p>Public attention may help raise awareness about endangered wildlife but can increase the risk of species exploitation as more people try to come in contact with them.</p>

<p>Zoo management says the extra earnings from skyrocketing visitor numbers -- almost double over the weekend -- will go towards improving the pygmy hippo enclosure and the zoo's public awareness campaigns.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Cristiana Barsony-Arcidiacono, a 49-year-old Hungarian-Italian businesswoman, has found herself at the centre of international headlines following the explosion of pagers that killed 12 people and wounded over 2,000.&nbsp;</p>

<p>She is the CEO of Hungary-based BAC Consulting, which&nbsp;was revealed to have licensed the design for the pagers from their original Taiwanese manufacturer Gold Apollo. Cristiana Barsony-Arcidiacono has denied direct involvement in the manufacture of the pagers. In a brief interview with <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/taiwan-firm-denies-making-pagers-used-lebanon-explosions-rcna171594">NBC News</a>, she said, “I am just the intermediate. I think you got it wrong.”</p>

<p>Here are a few details about Cristiana Barsony-Arcidiacono:&nbsp;</p>

<p>–&nbsp;Cristiana Barsony-Arcidiacono grew up near the port city of Catania in Itay's Sicily region. She attended school nearby was has been described as a reserved youngster by her then-schoolmates.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">– Cristiana Barsony-Arcidiacono holds a PhD in particle physics from University College London. Her dissertation was on the sub-atomic particle positron.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">– She has worked across various fields, from humanitarian work in Africa to claims of involvement in scientific and international organisations. However, many of her alleged senior roles, including as a project manager at the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and board member of New York's Earth Child Institute, have been debunked. The IAEA confirmed she was merely an intern, and the Earth Child Institute stated she had no formal role there.</p>

<p dir="ltr">–&nbsp;Described as intelligent but erratic by former colleagues, Barsony-Arcidiacono's career spans multiple continents and industries. She is believed to speak as many as 7 languages. She has held numerous short-term jobs, including one in Tunisia, where her contract was terminated early after being described as a “bullying” manager.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">– In the aftermath of the pager explosions, Barsony-Arcidiacono's mother revealed that her daughter is under the protection of Hungarian secret services due to threats she has received. This has only deepened the mystery surrounding her.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Acoustic waves coming from near the black hole at the heart of the Perseus cluster of galaxies were transposed up 57 and 58 octaves in order to make them audible for human ears.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">US space agency NASA has recorded an eerie audio clip that captures sound waves coming from near a supermassive black hole situated 250 million light years away. The acoustic waves, coming from near the black hole located at the heart of the Perseus cluster of galaxies, were transposed up 57 and 58 octaves to make them audible for human ears.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The audio was released in 2022 and it was the first time when the sound waves were extracted and made audible.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Sound vibrations (waves) do exist in space, even though we might not be able to hear them naturally.</p>

<p dir="ltr">In a surprising discovery in 2003, astronomers detected acoustic waves rippling out through the huge amounts of gas surrounding the supermassive black hole at the Perseus galaxy cluster, which is now popular for its eerie humming sound.</p>

<p><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ioR5np1fmEc?si=j_mmSoSCwg4vTqYA" title="YouTube video player" width="560"></iframe></p>

<p dir="ltr">It is difficult to hear them at their current pitch as it includes the lowest note ever detected in the universe by humans – much below the limits of human hearing.</p>

<p dir="ltr">NASA's recent sonification has majorly amplified these sound waves, in order to get a sense of how they would sound like while ringing through the intergalactic space.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The lowest note, which was identified in 2003, is a B-flat and is located over 57 octaves below middle C, the report said, adding that its frequency is 10 million years at that pitch.</p>

<p dir="ltr">It is to be noted that the lowest note that can be detected by human ears has a frequency of one-twentieth of a second.</p>

<p dir="ltr">After being extracted radically from the supermassive black hole, these sound waves were played in an anti-clockwise direction from the center.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">This was done to make them audible in all directions from around the supermassive black hole at the enhanced pitches of 144 quadrillion and 288 quadrillion higher then their original frequency.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Like several other waves recorded from space, the result for this one was eerie too.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">The tenuous gas and plasma, which drifts between the galaxies, in clusters known as the 'intracluster medium' is denser and much hotter than the intergalactic medium outside it. As the temperatures help to regulate&nbsp;star formation, hence sound waves could play a pivotal role in galaxy clusters' evolution over longer periods.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[Rinson Jose, an Indian emigrant to Norway, has been linked to the Hezbollah pager blasts in Lebanon, which killed 12 people. Reports have suggested that Norta Global, a Bulgaria-based company owned by him, had a role in supplying the pagers.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<ol>
	<li>Born in Kerala's Wayanad, Jose went to Norway to pursue higher studies a few years ago. He briefly worked in London before going back to Oslo.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Relatives told news agency IANS that Jose is settled with his wife in Oslo and has a twin brother based in London. "We speak daily over the phone. However, for the last three days, we have had no contact with Jose. He is a straightforward person and we trust him fully. He will not be part of any wrongdoing. He may have been trapped in these blasts," Thankachen, a relative of the 37-year-old, said on Friday.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Jose founded Norta Global Ltd in April 22. The company is based in Bulgaria's Sofia and declared a revenue of $ 725,000 (approximately Rs 6 crore) for consulting activities outside the European Union last year.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>According to his LinkedIn page, he has also worked for almost five years in digital customer support for Norwegian press group DN Media, news agency AFP reported. DN Media told newspaper Verdens Gang that he has been on an overseas work trip since Tuesday and that they have not been able to contact him.</li>
	<li>Bulgarian state security agency DANS said on Friday that the pagers used in the blasts in Lebanon were not imported, exported or manufactured in Bulgaria. It added that the company and its owner had "not carried out any transactions linked to the sale or purchase of the merchandise" or that "fall under laws on terrorism financing".</li>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Elon Musk-owned social media platform X has named a legal representative in Brazil, the firm's lawyers said on Friday, in a move that would address one of the demands imposed by Brazil's top court to allow the company to operate in the country.</p>

<p>Andre Zonaro and Sergio Rosenthal, who were recently appointed as X's lawyers in Brazil, told Reuters that colleague Rachel de Oliveira Conceicao was chosen as the firm's legal representative, and that they had submitted her name to the Supreme Court.</p>

<p>Brazilian law requires foreign companies to name a legal representative to operate in the country. The representative would assume the legal responsibilities for the firm locally.</p>

<p>X had a legal representative in Brazil until mid-August, when it decided to close its offices in the country.</p>

<p>In late August, Brazil's top court ordered mobile and internet service providers to block X in the nation, and users were cut off within hours after X did not name a new legal representative.</p>

<p>The move followed a months-long dispute between Musk and Brazilian Justice Alexandre de Moraes over the firm's non-compliance with court orders demanding the platform take action against the spread of hate speech.</p>

<p>Courts have previously blocked accounts implicated in probes of spreading misinformation and hate, which Musk has denounced as censorship.</p>

<p>On Thursday, the lawyers representing X in Brazil said the firm was starting to comply with orders on removing content, another demand from the top court.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Mark Robinson denied the allegations and called them "tabloid trash".]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">North Carolina's Republican gubernatorial candidate Mark Robinson allegedly referred to himself as a “Black Nazi,” insulted Martin Luther King Jr, used antisemitic and homophobic slurs, and praised slavery in comments on a pornographic website before entering politics, <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/19/politics/kfile-mark-robinson-black-nazi-pro-slavery-porn-forum/index.html">according to a CNN report</a>. The CNN investigation connects Robinson to a user named ‘minisoldr' who made the inflammatory remarks.</p>

<p>Robinson, who is also North Carolina's lieutenant governor, denied the allegations and called them “tabloid trash". He told CNN, “This is not us. These are not our words. And this is not anything that is characteristic of me."</p>

<p>The comments, which date back to between 2008 and 2012, were posted on a pornographic website.</p>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Among the most aggressive remarks attributed to Mark Robinson, under the username ‘minisoldr,' were statements supporting the reinstatement of slavery and Nazi ideology.</p>

<p>“Slavery is not bad. Some people need to be slaves,” one post read, while another said, “I'm a black NAZI!”.</p>

<p>In another post, Robinson allegedly expressed a preference for Adolf Hitler over US leadership during the Obama administration.</p>

<p>Robinson also allegedly referred to Martin Luther King Jr as a “f***ing commie b***ard” and suggested that if he were in the Ku Klux Klan, he would have called King “Martin Lucifer Koon.”</p>

<p>Robinson denied these allegations in a video posted to his X (formerly Twitter) account, stating that those were not his words. He also claimed that his Democratic opponent, Attorney General Josh Stein, was behind the alleged leak to CNN.</p>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Even during an interview with CNN, Robinson rejected any connection to these comments, saying, “I'm not going to get into the minutia of how somebody manufactured this, these salacious tabloid lies.”</p>

<p dir="ltr">However, CNN identified Robinson was ‘minisoldr' through his email address, biographical references, and unique phrases he had used elsewhere online. Robinson has also reportedly used the ‘minisoldr' username on other websites.</p>

<p>Despite the turmoil, Robinson remains defiant. “We are not getting out of this race. There are people who are counting on us to win this race,” he said.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Robinson, who has been endorsed by Trump, is currently trailing his Democratic opponent Josh Stein in the polls. If elected, Robinson would become North Carolina's first Black governor.</p>

<p>Asked about the CNN report about Robinson, Karoline Leavitt, a Trump campaign spokesperson, said "President Trump's campaign is focused on winning the White House and saving this country."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Sri Lanka President Ranil Wickremesinghe is fighting an uphill battle for a fresh mandate to continue belt-tightening measures that stabilised the economy.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cash-strapped Sri Lanka was voting for its next president Saturday in an effective referendum on an unpopular International Monetary Fund austerity plan enacted after the island nation's unprecedented financial crisis. President Ranil Wickremesinghe is fighting an uphill battle for a fresh mandate to continue belt-tightening measures that stabilised the economy and ended months of food, fuel, and medicine shortages. His two years in office restored calm to the streets after civil unrest spurred by the downturn in 2022 saw thousands storm the compound of his predecessor, who promptly fled the country.</p>

<p>"We must continue with reforms to end bankruptcy," Wickremesinghe, 75, said at his final rally in the capital Colombo this week.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Decide if you want to go back to the period of terror, or progress."</p>

<p>But Wickremesinghe's tax hikes and other measures, imposed per the terms of a $2.9-billion IMF bailout, have left millions struggling to make ends meet.</p>

<p>"The country needs new leadership," newspaper vendor Sunil, who did not give his surname, told AFP. "We need change."</p>

<p>Wickremesinghe is tipped to lose to one of two formidable challengers including Anura Kumara Dissanayaka, the leader of a once-marginal Marxist party tarnished by its violent past.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sri Lanka's crisis has proven an opportunity for the 55-year-old Dissanayaka, who has seen a surge of support based on his pledge to change the island's "corrupt" political culture.</p>

<p>Fellow opposition leader Sajith Premadasa, 57, the son of a former president assassinated in 1993 during the country's decades-long civil war, is also expected to make a strong showing.</p>

<p>"There is a significant number of voters trying to send a strong message... that they are very disappointed with the way this country has been governed," Murtaza Jafferjee of think tank Advocata told AFP.</p>

<p>A total of 39 people are contesting the vote, including one 79-year-old candidate who remains on the ballot despite dying of a heart attack last month.</p>

<p>More than 17 million people are eligible to vote in the election, with more than 63,000 police deployed to guard polling booths and counting centres.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We also have anti-riot squads on standby in case of any trouble, but so far everything is peaceful," police spokesman Nihal Talduwa said.</p>

<p>"In some areas, we have had to deploy police to ensure polling booths are safe from wild animals, especially wild elephants."</p>

<p>Dozens of people were lining up outside polling stations in Colombo before voting began.</p>

<p>Polls close at 4:00 pm (1030 GMT) with counting to begin on Saturday evening.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A result is expected on Sunday, but an official outcome could be delayed if the contest is close.</p>

<p>Schools were closed on Friday to be converted to polling stations, which will be staffed by more than 200,000 public servants deployed to conduct the vote.</p>

<h3><strong>'Not out of the woods'</strong></h3>

<p>Economic issues dominated the eight-week campaign, with public anger widespread over the hardships endured since the peak of the crisis two years ago.</p>

<p>Official data showed that Sri Lanka's poverty rate doubled to 25 percent between 2021 and 2022, adding more than 2.5 million people to those already living on less than $3.65 a day.</p>

<p>Experts warn that Sri Lanka's economy is still vulnerable, with payments on the island's $46-billion foreign debt yet to resume since a 2022 government default.</p>

<p>The IMF said reforms enacted by Wickremesinghe's government were beginning to pay off, with growth slowly returning.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The name of an Indian emigrant to Norway has cropped up in the investigation into the pager blasts aimed at Hezbollah operatives, which killed 12 people in Lebanon and left thousands injured. Now a Norwegian citizen, Rinson Jose migrated to the country from Wayanad in Kerala and reports had initially suggested that a company owned by the 37-year-old in Bulgaria was involved in the supply of the pagers to the militant group.</p>

<p>Initial investigations had revealed that the pagers, which had reportedly been modified by Mossad to hide three grams of explosives in each device, were manufactured by a Taiwan-based company, Gold Apollo. In a statement, the company said, however, that the pager model used in the blast, AR-924, was actually manufactured and sold by BAC Consulting KFT, a company based in Hungary's Budapest, which had been authorised to use its trademark.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Then, on Thursday, two days after the pagers exploded, Bulgarian state security agency DANS said it was coordinating with the country's interior ministry and probing the role of a company, whose name was later revealed to be Norta Global Ltd. The company, which was registered in Sofia in 2022, was found to be owned by a Norwegian, Rinson Jose.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A day later, on Friday, however, DANS said the pagers used in the blasts in Lebanon were not imported, exported or manufactured in Bulgaria.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Following verifications, it has been indisputably established that no communication equipment corresponding to those that exploded on September 17 was imported, exported or manufactured in Bulgaria," the agency was quoted as saying by news agency AFP.</p>

<p>It added that the company and its owner had "not carried out any transactions linked to the sale or purchase of the merchandise" or that "fall under laws on terrorism financing".</p>

<p>Police in Norway's Oslo said they have opened a "preliminary investigation into the information that has emerged".</p>

<p><strong>'Went To Norway To Study'</strong></p>

<p>According to a report by news agency IANS, Jose went to Norway to pursue higher studies a few years ago. He briefly worked in London before going back to Oslo.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to his LinkedIn page, he has also worked for almost five years in digital customer support for Norwegian press group DN Media, AFP reported. DN Media told newspaper Verdens Gang that he has been on an overseas work trip since Tuesday and that they have not been able to reach him.</p>

<p>Relatives told IANS that Jose is settled with his wife in Oslo and has a twin brother based in London. "We speak daily over the phone. However, for the last three days, we have had no contact with Jose. He is a straightforward person and we trust him fully. He will not be part of any wrongdoing. He may have been trapped in these blasts," Thankachen, a relative of the 37-year-old, told the news agency on Friday.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He added that they have not been able to contact Jose's wife either.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Norta Global, founded by Jose, declared a revenue of $ 725,000 (approximately Rs 6 crore) for consulting activities outside the European Union last year.&nbsp;</p>

       <description><![CDATA[The story of Stuxnet's development and deployment began years earlier. The inception of Stuxnet can be traced back to the early 2000s, during a period of heightened tension between Iran and Western nations over Iran's nuclear ambitions.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It's June, 2009. The streets of Tehran have erupted in protests over the results of a presidential election. The incumbent Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has emerged victorious with an overwhelming majority against Mir-Hossein Mousavi. Protesters alleged a fraudulent victory. Among them is a woman named Neda Agha-Soltan, who on her way to join the main protests, parked her car at some distance from the gathering and stepped out as the vehicle's air conditioner was not working. As she breathed in the fresh air, a sniper belonging to a government-funded militia took aim and shot her square in the chest. She was dead.</p>

<p>While this was unfolding in Tehran, around 300 kilometres to the south at the Natanz nuclear facility, the heart of Iran's nuclear program - 'strange' things were happening. Just days after Neda's death, the CIA reportedly received approval to initiate a cyber operation against this facility. The operation involved uploading a sophisticated piece of malware, known as <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.kaspersky.com/resource-center/definitions/what-is-stuxnet" target="_blank">Stuxnet</a>, directly onto Iranian hardware. This malware had been in development for years, a collaborative effort between the United States and Israel, and represented the world's first digital weapon.</p>

<h2><strong>Stuxnet: The Genesis</strong></h2>

<p>Stuxnet was not a new presence in Iran's nuclear infrastructure; it had been causing disruptions for years. However, this new version was designed to deliver a decisive blow.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The story of Stuxnet's development and deployment began years earlier. The inception of Stuxnet can be traced back to the early 2000s, during a period of heightened tension between Iran and Western nations over Iran's nuclear ambitions. The Bush administration, concerned about Iran's potential to develop nuclear weapons, sought unconventional methods to impede Tehran's progress. Thus, the covert operation codenamed 'Olympic Games' was born. This initiative, involving close collaboration between the CIA, the NSA, and Israel's Mossad, aimed to create a digital weapon capable of physically disrupting Iran's nuclear enrichment capabilities.</p>

<p>Stuxnet was not an ordinary piece of malware. Its design reflected a level of sophistication unprecedented in the realm of cyber weapons. The malware targeted Siemens Step7 software, used to control industrial equipment, specifically focusing on the centrifuges at Iran's Natanz uranium enrichment facility. These centrifuges, essential for enriching uranium, operated at high speeds and required precise control to function correctly.</p>

<h2><strong>Stuxnet: The Execution</strong></h2>

<p>The US built a replica of Iran's nuclear facility in its <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/16/world/middleeast/16stuxnet.html" target="_blank">Oak Ridge facility</a> in the state of Tennessee, where they meticulously studied the centrifuges to understand how to sabotage them without detection. In 2007, the first version of Stuxnet was released, targeting these centrifuges by preventing the release of pressure through the valves, causing the uranium gas to solidify and the centrifuges to spin out of control and ultimately self-destruct.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-09/94hrnf28_oak-ridge-_625x300_21_September_24.jpg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>

<p class="ins_instory_dv_caption"><span class="ins_instory_span_credit">Photo Credit: Oak Ridge National Laboratory </span></p>
</div>

<p>Iran's nuclear facility was air-gapped, meaning its network was offline, so Stuxnet had to be introduced via an inside agent using a USB drive. The malware operated undetected, using a rootkit to hide its presence and stolen digital certificates to appear as legitimate commands. Despite its effectiveness, initial versions of Stuxnet only slowed Iran's progress, and did not sabotage it entirely.</p>

<p>In response, US researchers developed a more aggressive version of Stuxnet, using four zero-day exploits and stolen private keys to sign its commands. This version could spread rapidly, even across air-gapped networks, and reprogram the centrifuges to destroy themselves while masking the sabotage as hardware malfunctions.</p>

<h2><strong>Stuxnet: The Implications</strong></h2>

<p>An insider at Natanz introduced this new version of Stuxnet, and it quickly spread throughout the facility's network. However, its aggressive nature led to unintended consequences: the malware spread beyond Natanz, infecting computers across Iran and eventually the globe. The CIA, realising the uncontrollable spread of Stuxnet, decided to continue with the operation, hoping it would remain undetected within Natanz.</p>

<p>Their hopes were dashed when cybersecurity firm Symantec discovered Stuxnet and published a detailed report on the malware. Iran soon realised the extent of the cyber attack and took measures to protect their nuclear program. Despite the setbacks caused by Stuxnet, Iran vowed to continue its nuclear ambitions.</p>

<p>One of the earlier hints of Stuxnet's existence emerged in June 2010 when a Belarusian cybersecurity firm discovered an unusual piece of malware on an Iranian computer. As cybersecurity experts from around the world began analysing the code, they were astounded by its complexity and purpose.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Impact On Iran's Nuclear Program</strong></h2>

<p>Stuxnet's impact on Iran's nuclear program was significant but not immediately catastrophic. By 2009, Iran had installed over 7,000 centrifuges at Natanz, but Stuxnet caused approximately 1,000 of these to fail. The disruptions forced Iran to temporarily halt its enrichment activities and replace the damaged equipment, delaying its nuclear ambitions by several months to years.</p>

<p>The Iranian government, initially oblivious to the cause of the centrifuge failures, eventually recognised the cyber intrusion. Publicly, Iran downplayed the impact of Stuxnet, but internally, it spurred significant investment in cybersecurity measures and the development of offensive cyber capabilities.</p>

<p>Over the following years, targeted assassinations of key Iranian nuclear scientists further crippled their program. Car bombings and other attacks eliminated many of the leaders involved, including the director of the Natanz facility.</p>

<h2><strong>Stuxnet: Global Fallout</strong></h2>

<p>Stuxnet did not confine itself to Iran. It spread to other countries, including India, Indonesia, and Pakistan, affecting industrial systems worldwide. In India, several critical infrastructure facilities, &nbsp;reportedly infecting as many as 80,000 computers. Several power plants and manufacturing units were also found to be vulnerable to similar attacks.</p>

<p>In 2013, India adopted the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.meity.gov.in/writereaddata/files/National_cyber_security_policy-2013_0.pdf">National Cyber Security Policy</a> which focused on "protection of information infrastructure and preservation of the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information in cyberspace". The following year, the Centre announced the formation of the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.india.gov.in/website-national-critical-information-infrastructure-protection-centre" target="_blank">National Critical Information Infrastructure Protection Centre</a> to further safeguard India's cyber security space.&nbsp;<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A female official in China has been sentenced to 13 years in prison and fined one million yuan (approximately Rs 1.18 crore) for misconduct. According to the <em>South China Morning Post (SCMP)</em>, Zhong Yang, nicknamed "the beautiful governor" for her looks, served as the governor and deputy secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) in Qiannan prefecture, Guizhou province. She has been accused of having sexual relations with 58 male subordinates and accepting nearly 60 million yuan in bribes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The 52-year-old joined the Communist Party at 22, eventually rising to the rank of deputy in the National People's Congress (NPC). Zhong became known for starting a fruit and agriculture association aimed at helping farmers, as well as spending her own money to support the elderly in need, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scmp.com/news/people-culture/china-personalities/article/3279110/china-official-infamous-keeping-58-staff-members-lovers-amassing-illegal-funds-jailed" rel="noindex, nofollow"><em>SCMP </em></a>reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In January, a documentary produced by Guizhou Radio and Television uncovered controversies involving Zhong. It was reported that Ms Zhong accepted bribes and used her position to ensure that companies she favoured received lucrative contracts, under the pretext of government investment. This included approving the development of land in a high-tech industrial estate for a businessman who had a close relationship with her.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the documentary, a private business owner claimed that Ms Zhong would neglect companies without personal ties to her. The documentary also revealed that in 2023, the Guizhou Provincial Discipline Inspection and Supervision Committee announced that Ms Zhong was suspected of serious disciplinary and legal violations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Moreover, the 52-year-old has also been accused of engaging in affairs with 58 male subordinates. Some reportedly chose to be her lover due to the advantages she offered, while others did so reluctantly as they feared her authority. Ms Zhong allegedly spent time with her lovers under the pretext of working overtime and going on business trips.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ms Zhong was arrested in April 2023. In September, she was removed from office and expelled from the CPC. She also lost her position in the National People's Congress.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the documentary, Ms Zhong said she regrets her actions. "I can't face my former colleagues, family members, or the leaders who have cared for and nurtured me. I am truly ashamed and embarrassed," she said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The 52-year-old added that she had mistakenly believed she needed to cultivate a few trustworthy businessmen to help her handle political issues. She also noted that after she became an official, her parents would prepare a simple dish of vegetables and boiled tofu for her during Chinese New Year. "They told me... that my work and life should be like the dish, clean and pure. I accepted it every year and ate the food, but I didn't take their advice to heart," she said.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel killed a top Hezbollah commander in an airstrike on Beirut's southern suburbs on Friday, the Israeli military and security sources in Lebanon said, escalating a year-long conflict between Israel and the Iran-backed group.</p>

<p>Here is a list of some operations against Hezbollah and Hamas leaders and commanders blamed on Israel.</p>

<h3><strong>HEZBOLLAH:&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p><strong>IBRAHIM AQIL</strong></p>

<p>An Israeli strike in Beirut's southern suburbs killed Hezbollah's operations commander Ibrahim Aqil, who serves on the group's top military body, on Sept. 20.</p>

<p>Aqil, who has also used the aliases Tahsin and Abdelqader, is a member of Hezbollah's top military body, the Jihad Council.</p>

<p>The United States accuses him of a role in the Beirut truck bombings that struck the American embassy in April 1983, which killed 63 people, and the US Marine barracks six months later which killed 241 people.</p>

<p><strong>FUAD SHUKR</strong></p>

<p>An Israeli strike on the southern suburbs of Lebanon's capital on July 30 killed Hezbollah's top commander Fuad Shukr, identified by the Israeli military as the right-hand man of Hezbollah chief Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah.</p>

<p>Shukr was one of Hezbollah's leading military figures since it was established by Iran's Revolutionary Guards more than four decades ago.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A new report has shown that the US Secret Service is responsible for security failures in the assassination attempt against former President Donald Trump at a rally in Pennsylvania on July 13, which led to one death and multiple injuries.</p>

<p>An internal review by the agency revealed on Friday that agents neglected to use technology that could have identified the attacker when he flew a drone over the rally site hours before the incident, Xinhua news agency reported.</p>

<p>The report highlighted failures by the Secret Service's advance team and its coordination with state and local law enforcement prior to the attack. The Secret Service, responsible for overseeing Trump's security, failed to instruct local police snipers to secure a nearby rooftop.</p>

<p>Former Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle, who resigned amid widespread outrage over the agency's failure to prevent the incident, was previously grilled by multiple lawmakers at a Congressional hearing on why the agency failed to secure the rooftop.</p>

<p>At a news briefing on Friday, Acting Director Ronald Rowe highlighted a "lack of clarity" from the Secret Service in their security planning for Trump's rally.</p>

<p>At the rally, just shortly before shots were fired into the crowd, some people saw the suspect climbing on top of the roof and alerted local police, but Trump's protective detail had no idea police were searching for the suspicious person.</p>

<p>Secret Service agents and local law enforcement operated on different radio frequencies and were stationed in separate locations, which hindered their ability to quickly share information.</p>

<p>"It's important that we hold ourselves accountable for the failures of July 13th, and that we use the lessons learned to make sure that we do not have another failure like this again," Rowe said.</p>

<p>After the assassination attempt of Trump in Pennsylvania, the Secret Service allocated additional resources not typically provided to someone in Trump's position.</p>

<p>On Sunday, a man was arrested after a Secret Service agent spotted a rifle barrel sticking out of a fence at the Trump International Golf Club in South Florida and "engaged" with him. Trump was unharmed in what appears to be the second assassination attempt in about two months.</p>

<p>Just days after the second assassination attempt, the US House of Representatives on Friday unanimously approved a bill that aims to enhance Secret Service protection for the presidential nominees and their respective vice presidential candidates.</p>

<p>The bill would require the Secret Service to "apply the same standards for determining the number of agents required to protect presidents, vice presidents, and major presidential and vice presidential candidates".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

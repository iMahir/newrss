       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 27-year-old model allegedly fatally shot her husband before taking her own life inside their luxury home in Florida, US. According to the <em>New York Post</em>, the incident occurred on Wednesday at 12:30am. Cops responded to a report of multiple shots fired at the Beach Club II Hallendale at 1830 South Ocean Drive. Upon arrival, they discovered Pajtim Krasniqi, 34, and his wife, Sabrina Krasniqi, 27, lying on the balcony of their lavish condo. They were both pronounced dead at the scene, police said.</p>

<p>In a heartbreaking Facebook post, Albana Krasniqi Munrett wrote, "My Thanksgiving Eve wasn't spent with my husband and children. It wasn't spent with friends. It was spent with police officers, detectives and news reports talking about the vicious and senseless murder of my youngest brother by his wife."&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Pajtimi's wife chose to take my brother's life away from him when she shot 5 bullets into his chest. The person he trusted the most, the person he chose to spend his life with was the one who took his away from him. She betrayed him, his love and his trust. She shattered my family. My siblings and I will never be the same. I'm terrified my mother will not ever recover," the post continued.</p>

<p>According to <em>The <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/29/us-news/sabrina-krasniqi-fatally-shoots-husband-pajtim-in-florida-murder-suicide-cops/" rel="noindex,nofollow">Post</a></em>, aerial footage of the police investigation revealed what appeared to be bullet holes in a glass door, with pools of blood nearby. Inside the unit was a teddy bear, a box of roses with a heart on it and the TV still on, per the outlet.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The cops responded to the scene after receiving an alert from ShotSpotter, a gunfire detection program. This program captured at least five shots erupting in quick succession, followed by a brief pause and then a sixth gunshot.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Police have ruled their deaths a murder-suicide but they still are investigating what led up to the fatal shooting.</p>

<p>According to reports, Sabrina Krasniqi was a model featured in a 2021 Inside Edition segment. The incident also made headlines in Albania as the duo were Kosovar Albanian nationals with ties to New York and Peja, Kosovo.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Italy is reportedly in talks with India to expand cooperation on port infrastructure, including ship and yacht manufacturing sectors. The discussion encompasses broader areas of blue economy and space exploration, Bloomberg News reported on Saturday.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Italy is reportedly in talks with India to expand cooperation on port infrastructure, including ship and yacht manufacturing sectors. The discussion encompasses broader areas of blue economy and space exploration, Bloomberg News reported on Saturday, citing Italian Industry Minister Adolfo Urso.</p>

<p>India and Italy share cultural and trade ties dating back centuries, the report cited Mr Urso, who is also Minister of Made in Italy, as saying.</p>

<p>This means the two nations are well placed to build a "Cotton Route" as an alternative to China's "Silk Route," investing in ports, logistics, data and information technologies such as undersea cables, he said while speaking to Bloomberg on the sidelines of the Tour Vespucci in Mumbai on Saturday.</p>

<p>On the issue of the potential impacts of the Middle East war on the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC), the Italian leader said that "war is all around us in Europe."&nbsp;</p>

<p>He, however, said that an alternative is needed, as the Russia-Ukraine war has disrupted continental routes. It will also help alleviate pressure on the Suez Canal, the Minister said.</p>

<p>Replying to a question about prospects of IMEC finding support under the upcoming US President Donald Trump's administration, Mr Urso said the corridor meets the strategic needs of both the US and Europe.</p>

<p>IMEC is an initiative to establish a new trade and logistics corridor linking the Mediterranean with the Indo-Pacific via the Middle East.</p>

<h2><strong>India- Italy "Informal" Talks</strong></h2>

<p>Meanwhile, Union Shipping, Ports and Waterways Minister Sarbananda Sonowal on Saturday told reporters that India and Italy held "informal" talks on Saturday.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When asked about developments on the upcoming IMEC, the Minister said Italy has made some wishes and added that India will take the necessary steps on this aspect.</p>

<p>&nbsp;"Both India and Italy are strong maritime nations having advanced space programmes," Sonowal said, stressing that ecology and economic aspirations have to go hand in hand.</p>

<p>"From the enormousness of the ocean to the infinite vastness of space, the potential and benefit of the India-Italy partnership is immense," he said.</p>

<p>The Minister also invited Italian museums to collaborate with India for the upcoming National Maritime Heritage Complex (NMHC) in Gujarat's Lothal. &nbsp;The Union Cabinet had recently given the nod for the NMHC, which is estimated to cost over Rs 3,500 crore, as per some reports.</p>

<h2><strong>India-ItalyTies</strong></h2>

<p>Italy and India share common interests and joint challenges in the Indo-Mediterranean Sea, a region vital for global trade. Recently, both India and Italy have intensified their bilateral relationship, advancing cooperation across political, economic, and defence sectors.</p>

<p>This partnership has the potential to position both India and Italy as major players in the Indo-Pacific and Mediterranean region, where stability and collaboration are essential for global trade and security.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In 2023, India with Italy, the United States, the United Arab Emirates, France, Saudi Arabia, Germany, and the European Union agreed to establish the India–Middle East Economic Corridor (IMEC) to enhance global trade and counter China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).</p>

<p>The IMEC aims to connect a combined GDP of US $47 trillion with a comprehensive infrastructure network and focuses on high-efficiency trade routes, renewable energy, digital infrastructure and improved international communication networks, according to a report by East Asia Forum.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thousands of protesters returned outside the parliament in Tbilisi on Saturday to protest against the Georgian government's decision to suspend European Union (EU) membership talks amid a post-election crisis. Police deployed water cannons, tear gas and pepper sprays to confront the pro-European protesters, who have been on the streets since Georgia's ruling party on Thursday said it was halting EU accession talks until 2028.</p>

<p>Protesters carrying Georgian and EU flags marched towards the Soviet-built parliament building. They hurled fireworks at police officers, while authorities forced them away from the assembly and down Rustaveli Boulevard toward the opera house, according to a report by Reuters. At least 10 employees of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and 32 police officers were reportedly injured during the confrontation with the protestors, the Black Sea nation's interior ministry said.</p>

<p>As per the Interior Ministry, 107 people were detained for "disobedience to lawful police orders and petty hooliganism."</p>

<p>"Throughout the night... protesters threw various objects, including stones, pyrotechnics, glass bottles, and metal items, at law enforcement officers," it said.</p>

<h2><strong>Unrest In Girogia</strong></h2>

<p>Georgia has been rocked by turmoil since the ruling Georgian Dream party claimed victory in the October 26 parliamentary election that the pro-EU opposition said was fraudulent. The party has ruled Georgia since 2012 and is often accused by critics of trying to move the country closer to Russia and away from the EU. Ahead of October's elections, it pushed through legislation targeting independent civil society and curbing LGBTQ rights, drawing warnings from Brussels.</p>

<p>After the party claimed victory in last month's election, Opposition lawmakers have questioned the results of the election.&nbsp;Alleging fraud, they boycotted the new parliament.</p>

<p>Following this, the country's President Salome Zourabishvili, who is reportedly at loggerheads with the governing party - called the one-party parliament "unconstitutional". She sought to annul the election results through the country's constitutional court.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Reuters" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-11/b46fvmbg_georgia-protest-reuters_625x300_30_November_24.jpg?im=FaceCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=1200,height=738" title="Reuters" /></div>

<p class="ins_instory_dv_caption"><em><small>Reuters</small></em></p>
</div>

<p>The European Parliament on Thursday backed a resolution calling last month's election as the latest stage in Georgia's "worsening democratic crisis" and saying that the ruling party was "fully responsible", according to a report by BBC.</p>

<p>The resolution also expressed concern about reports of vote manipulation and buying, voter intimidation and harassment of observers.</p>

<p>Following the resolution, Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze said his government had "decided not to bring up the issue of joining the European Union on the agenda until the end of 2028".</p>

<p>He said Georgia would continue to implement the reforms required for accession and that it still planned to join by 2030, but added that it was "crucial for the EU to respect our national interests and traditional values".</p>

<p>Georgia has the official EU candidate status since 2023. However, according to the BBC report, Belgium had halted Georgia's accession process earlier this year over the country's "Russia-style law" targeting organizations accused of "pursuing the interests of a foreign power"</p>

<h2><strong>Latest Protest</strong></h2>

<p>European Union accession is a popular issue in Georgia, and freezing of application talks has been met with widespread anger from people, who aim to see EU membership written into their constitution. Thousands massed outside the parliament building in Tbilisi on Thursday before they were dispersed by riot police using water cannons and gas.</p>

<p class="ins_instory_dv_caption"><em><small>Reuters</small></em></p>
</div>

<p>The protesters returned on Friday and Saturday and were faced with violent suppression of resistance by the government. Independent TV station Pirveli said one of its journalists covering the protest was hospitalised with serious injuries after police beat her and a cameraman.</p>

<p>Pro-Western President Zurabishvili has also put her weight behind the protestors. In a televised address to the nation, she said: "The resistance movement has begun... I stand in solidarity with it.</p>

<p>"We will remain united until Georgia achieves its goals: to return to its European path, secure new elections."</p>

<p>On Friday, hundreds of serving employees of the country's foreign, defence, education and justice ministries signed open letters denouncing the freeze in talks as unconstitutional.</p>

<p>A string of private universities have said they are suspending studies amid the unrest, while business groups have called for the government to review its stance.</p>

<h2><strong>Worsening Relations With The EU</strong></h2>

<p>Georgia's move to halt membership talks caps months of deteriorating relations between Tbilisi and the West, which has accused the Georgian Dream government of authoritarian and pro-Russian inclinations.</p>

<p>Georgian Dream has this year passed laws against so-called "foreign agents" and LGBT rights, which critics say are draconian in nature and Russian in inspiration.</p>

<p>The party, which is widely seen as controlled by its founder, billionaire and former prime minister Bidzina Ivanishvili, says it wants eventually to join the EU, and that the laws it has passed are necessary to defend Georgia's traditional values.</p>

<p>The EU's ambassador to Georgia described Georgian Dream's stance as "heartbreaking" on Friday and condemned the crackdown on protesters.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called Friday for NATO to offer guaranteed protections to parts of Ukraine controlled by Kyiv in order to "stop the hot stage of the war."]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called Friday for NATO to offer guaranteed protections to parts of Ukraine controlled by Kyiv in order to "stop the hot stage of the war."</p>

<p>Zelensky also implied he would be willing to wait to regain the almost one-fifth of his country that Russia's army has seized, if such a deal could offer security for the rest of Ukraine and end the fighting.</p>

<p>The comments came amidst escalating tensions in the near three-year war.</p>

<p>Russia has this week threatened to strike government buildings in Kyiv and launched a massive aerial attack on Ukraine's energy sector -- something it called a response to Ukraine firing US and British supplied missiles on Russian territory.</p>

<p>"If we want to stop the hot stage of the war, we should take under NATO umbrella the territory of Ukraine that we have under our control," Zelensky told Britain's Sky News, according to a voiceover translation of his remarks from Ukrainian into English.</p>

<p>"That's what we need to do fast, and then Ukraine can get back the other part of its territory diplomatically," he added.</p>

<p>Talk of a possible ceasefire or peace deal has ratched up since Donald Trump won the US presidential election earlier this month.</p>

<p>The Republican has criticised US aid to Kyiv and claimed he could halt the conflict within hours, without saying how.</p>

<p>Russia controls around 18 percent of Ukraine's internationally recognised territory, including the Crimean peninsula which Moscow annexed in 2014.</p>

<p>Since invading in 2022, Moscow has claimed four more eastern and southern regions of Ukraine -- Donetsk, Kherson, Lugansk and Zaporizhzhia -- as its own, despite not having full control over them.</p>

<p>Kyiv has repeatedly ruled out ceding territory in exchange for peace, while Russian President Vladimir Putin has demanded Ukraine's army withdraw from swathes more land.</p>

<p><strong>'Guarantees'</strong></p>

<p>Zelensky insisted any offer to join NATO must be given to the whole of Ukraine, but his comments about the "NATO umbrella" suggest he might accept the alliance's practical protections, like the Article Five collective defence clause, only be extended to territory controlled by Kyiv.</p>

<p>Such an arrangement would be necessary to ensure Russia does not attack again in the future, he said.</p>

<p>"If we speak ceasefire, (we need) guarantees that Putin will not come back," Zelensky said in English.</p>

<p>Putin has previously called on Kyiv to renounce its NATO ambitions if it wants a peace deal.</p>

<p>With the conflict escalating on the battlefield, Zelensky has held a string of phone calls with Western leaders in recent days -- including Britain's Keir Starmer, France's Emmanuel Macron and Germany's Olaf Scholz.</p>

<p>US Secretary of State Antony Blinken also spoke to Ukraine's foreign minister on Friday to brief him on "US goals for sustainable support for Ukraine," State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said.</p>

<p>Joe Biden's administration has stepped up its support to Kyiv since Trump won the election, transferring more weapons and giving Ukraine permission to fire long-range missiles onto Russian territory.</p>

<p>That move triggered a furious response in Moscow, with Putin authorising the firing of a new hypersonic missile at the Ukrainian city of Dnipro and threatening to strike government targets in Kyiv in response.</p>

<p>Zelensky on Friday appointed a new Land Forces Commander, Mykhailo Drapaty, in a move to bolster army leadership.</p>

<p>Drapaty previously led forces in the northeastern Kharkiv sector, defending against a surprise new Russian offensive earlier this year.</p>

<p>"These personnel decisions are aimed at strengthening our army, enhancing its combat readiness, and introducing new management approaches," Defence Minister Rustem Umerov said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An Indian-origin man who brutally beat up his girlfriend to death at his home in East Midlands region of England, has been sentenced to life imprisonment by a UK court.</p>

<p>Police described it as a case of domestic abuse and said it is vital anyone suffering gets the support they need to put a stop before it is too late.</p>

<p>Raj Sidpara, a 50-year-old resident of Leicester, was convicted last week of the murder of Tarnjeet Riaz, also known as Tarnjeet Chagger, following a trial at Leicester Crown Court.</p>

<p>On Friday, Raj Sidpara was handed a life sentence with a minimum term of 21 years behind bars before being considered for parole, according to Leicestershire Police.</p>

<p>The couple had been in a relationship for around five months and by the time emergency services were called to his home on Tarbat Road on the afternoon of May 6, Tarnjeet was already dead.</p>

<p>Tarnjeet, 44, was found with extensive trauma to her face, as well as multiple broken ribs, when she was found unresponsive by the emergency services, who had been called by Sidpara.</p>

<p>In October, Sidpara admitted the lesser manslaughter charge of causing the injuries to his girlfriend but denied intending to kill her or cause her serious harm.</p>

<p>The court heard that his victim was left with "two enormous black eyes", bleeding on the brain and 20 rib fractures, among other injuries. "You have steadfastly refused to explain what you did or why," Judge William Harbage said, addressing the accused in court.</p>

<p>"What's clear is that you attacked her in a savage and merciless way; you punched, kicked and stamped on her in a sustained attack," a BBC court report read.</p>

<p>The court heard that Sidpara was diagnosed with alcohol dependence syndrome and had 24 previous convictions for 46 offences, including threats to kill and harassment of previous girlfriends and people connected to them.</p>

<p>Sidpara's sentencing comes as Leicestershire Police said it has joined organisations across the globe to support "White Ribbon Day", focussed on targeted action around violence against women and girls.</p>

<p>"Tarnjeet was killed at the hands of someone she was in a relationship with. Someone who should have supported and protected her, not someone she should have feared would brutally attack her," said Senior Investigating Officer Detective Inspector Emma Matts.</p>

<p>"While the person responsible will now spend many years behind bars, Tarnjeet's family are left with so many questions and the overwhelming feeling of wondering if they could have done more.</p>

<p>We know domestic abuse is very complex. Often victims don't want to share with family and friends the details of what is happening behind closed doors, let alone with police, but it is vital anyone suffering gets the support they need to put a stop to the abuse before it is too late," she said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<h2><strong>Hindu Monk's Arrest &amp; Violence In Bangladesh</strong></h2>

<p>Hindu priest, Chinmoy Krishna Das, a former member of the International Society of Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) of Bangladesh, was arrested on Monday in connection with a sedition case.&nbsp;His arrest triggered protests by Hindu community members in various locations in Bangladesh, including in the capital Dhaka and Chattogram.</p>

<p>Chinmoy Krishna Das was denied bail by a&nbsp;Chattogram court on Tuesday, which followed clashes between the police and protestors demanding his release.&nbsp;Assistant public prosecutor Saiful Islam was killed in the clashes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bangladesh police have so far arrested nine persons in connection with the lawyer's murder, police said on Saturday.&nbsp;They were arrested after a case was filed against 46 persons, mostly cleanliness workers belonging to the minority Hindu community.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, three Hindu temples were vandalised by a slogan-shouting mob on Friday in Chattogram, which has witnessed protests and violence since a former ISKCON member was booked under sedition charges.</p>

<p>The attack took place around 2:30 pm in the port city's Harish Chandra Munsef Lane, where the Shantaneshwari Matri Temple, the nearby Shoni Temple, and the Shantaneshwari Kalibari Temple were targeted, news portal BDNews24.com reported.</p>

<p>"A group of several hundred slogan-shouting people threw brickbats at the temples, damaging the Shoni Temple and the gates of the other two temples," the news portal quoted temple authorities as saying.</p>

<p>Kotwali Police Station chief Abdul Karim confirmed the attack, saying that assailants attempted to damage the temples.</p>

<h3><strong>Violence Against Minorities In Bangladesh</strong></h3>

<p>Chinmoy Krishna Das's arrest came amid tensions over minority rights in Bangladesh, which has seen widespread political violence since former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's ouster. Since the ouster of former PM Sheikh Hasina, the new military-backed interim government led by Mohammed Yunus has faced criticism for failing to curb a spike in violence against minorities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hindus comprise approximately 8 per cent of Bangladesh's 170 million people.</p>

<p>Speaking on the issue of oppression of minorities in Bangladesh, Trimamool Congress&nbsp;national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee asked the union government to take up the matter with their Bangladeshi counterpart in the "strongest manner."<br />
<br />
"I have cleared my stand that you have to follow the Constitution of the country and the state has no role in it. The onus is on the Union government to take it up with the Bangladesh government in the strongest manner or in the language they understand," he said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Billionaire Elon Musk has revealed what he and Barron Trump discussed while celebrating Thanksgiving at Mar-a-Lago. US President-elect Donald Trump hosted a lavish Thanksgiving dinner at his Flordia home, alongside family and special guests including Tesla and SpaceX owner Elon Musk and his mother, Maye Musk. Several videos surfaced from the night, in which the Musks were seen sharing the same table as Mr Trump, his wife Melania, and their youngest son, Barron. The clip went viral and left many speculating what the VIP guests were discussing during the event.&nbsp;</p>

<p>One X user jokingly shared a screenshot of Mr Trump speaking with Barron, with a mocked conversation. "'Is it okay if I'm friends with Elon?' 'I'll allow it, Father,'" the caption of the post read. Mr Musk replied to the tweet, saying he had been talking to the president-elect's son about "consciousness and video games".&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Mr Musk's mother, Maye, also joined the conversation and wrote, "They were talking all night. Barron is very smart."</p>

<p>The Musk family presence at Mr Trump's Thanksgiving celebration added a special touch to the family gathering, which also featured a moment when Mr Musk was seen grooving to the 'YMCA' song while seated alongside the president-elect. The clip captured Mr Trump playfully tapping Mr Musk on the shoulder, prompting the billionaire to raise his hand and move to the beat.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Hope you had a great Thanksgiving," Mr Musk later posted on X.&nbsp;</p>

Mr Musk, who has over 206 million followers on X, posted or reposted about Mr Trump's cabinet picks more than 70 times between November 7 and November 20, a Reuters review found. In between his constant postings of memes of himself and Mr Trump, the X boss has even embraced a title suggested for his role: "First Buddy".</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Syrian Islamist rebels have launched one of their biggest offensive against President Bashar al-Assad's forces in years, sweeping through government-held towns before taking control of "half of the city of Aleppo". This is the first major challenge to President Assad and his allies-- Russia and Iran-- in four years. Rebels, led by the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), advanced from the remaining Syrian opposition-held region of Idlib, where front lines have been largely stagnant since Russia and Turkey, which backed the rebels, agreed to a ceasefire in 2020.</p>

<p>By Friday, the opposition fighters and their Turkish-backed allies had taken more than 50 towns and villages in the north and entered the western districts of Aleppo, a city of around two million people that was Syria's pre-war manufacturing hub.</p>

<p>The fighters swiftly captured half of Aleppo without meeting significant resistance, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"There has been no fighting, not a single shot was fired, as regime forces withdrew," AFP quoted Observatory's director Rami Abdel Rahman as saying.</p>

<p>The offensive began on Wednesday, the same day Iran-backed Hezbollah and Israel entered a fragile ceasefire agreement in Lebanon. Bashar al-Assad's Syrian government and its Russian backers reportedly retaliated with air strikes in the newly captured territory and other rebel-held areas.</p>

<p>According to the Britain-based Observatory, the fighting was initially fierce, with 277 people killed. The toll included 28 civilians, most killed by Russian air strikes.</p>

<h2><strong>Civil War In Syria</strong></h2>

<p>The civil war in Syria began in March 2011 when Mr Assad's regime launched a bloody crackdown on pro-democracy protests in the city of Deraa. The Assad family, which ruled Syria since 1971, used brutal force to try to crush the uprising. The demonstrations soon spread across the country, with protestors arming themselves to defend their towns and launch attacks on the Syrian army.</p>

<p>In the following months, the rebels fractured into hundreds of armed groups. The conflict also attracted jihadist extremist groups like HTS--a faction formerly linked to the terrorist group Al Qaeda-- who soon became one of the dominant anti-government factions. United States has proscribed HTS as a terrorist group.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With rebel groups making gains during the early years of the civil war, Bashar al-Assad sought help from his allies for his regime to survive. Iran, Syria's closest ally, backed his regime from the beginning of the war by providing advisers, weapons, billions of dollars and troops to help Mr Assad maintain his grip, according to a report by The Telegraph.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Iranian-backed groups like Hezbollah have also been reportedly supporting Mr Assad's army since at least 2012. Russia also decided to back the government forces in 2015, with President Vladimir Putin committing Moscow's air force as well as ground troops to ensure the Syrian regime did not fall.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, neighbouring Turkey, another major player in the war, threw its weight behind the opposition to Mr Assad's regime. Ankara used rebel factions in Syria to contain the Kurdish YPG, that dominates the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). According to Ankara, the group is an extension of a banned Kurdish rebel group in Turkey, as per <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2024/11/28/why-syrian-rebels-have-chosen-now-to-try-to-oust-assad/" rel="No Follow, No Index" target="_blank">The Telegraph </a>report.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But with Tehran and Moscow's help, Mr Assad was able to change the tide of rebellion and recapture major cities, and in March 2020, Russia-- which backs Mr Assad-- and Turkey-- which supports the rebels-- brokered a cease-fire to halt fighting in the Idlib region.</p>

<p>As per a United Nations estimate released in 2022, around 300,000 people had been killed in the decade-long conflict.</p>

<h2><strong>Latest Uprising</strong></h2>

<p>Over the years, Moscow and Tehran have robustly helped President Bashar al-Assad's autocratic regime to stave off the rebels. However, in recent months, the ceasefire has been repeatedly breached, with analysts saying there has been a rise in attacks against the enclave by the Mr Assad regime and its allies.</p>

<p>The later offensive reportedly unites various rebel factions that represent the last vestiges of opposition groups. The main group is HTS, which controls most of the northwestern territory still held by opposition groups. Several Turkish-backed rebel groups have also joined the offensive, according to a report by the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/28/world/middleeast/syria-civil-war.html" rel="No Follow, NO Index" target="_blank">New York Times</a>.</p>

<p>As per the report, Lt. Col. Hassan Abdulghany, military commander of the opposition's operations room, issued a video statement announcing the offensive and said the attack was aimed at stemming Syrian airstrikes and other attacks on opposition-held territory.</p>

<p>“To push back their fire from our people, this operation is not a choice. It is an obligation to defend our people and their land...It has become clear to everyone that the regime militias and their allies, including the Iranian mercenaries, have declared an open war on the Syrian people,” he said.</p>

<h2><strong>Timing of Rebellion Against Mr Asaad's Regime</strong></h2>

<p>While Syria hasn't been directly involved in the ongoing conflicts in the Middle East, its territory has reportedly long been a proxy battlefield for international powers. For years, Israel has carried out deadly strikes in Syria, saying its targets are Iran-backed groups including the Lebanese group Hezbollah.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Those attacks have escalated in the wake of the Hamas-led attack on Israel on October 7, 2023. This has weakened Asaad's regime. Moreover, Presidnet Asaad has relied on Russian and Iranian forces help to keep the rebels in check for years, but the ongoing conflicts in the Middle East have also weakened his allies.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Pro-regime militias have been upping their attacks in the area, trying to deter the rebels because Israel has been weakening the Syrian regime's allies like Hezbollah and Iran,” said Natasha Hall, a senior fellow with the Middle East Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies told the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/middleeast/syria-opposition-forces-bases.html" rel="No Follow, No Index" target="_blank">New York Times</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Experts said that the success of the offensive so far indicates that the Syrian government is vulnerable and various opposition factions are growing their prowess.</p>

<p>“Years ago, an offence of this size would have been pushed back by the regime,” Charles Lister, the Director of the Middle East Institute's Syria and Counterterrorism programmes, told the newspaper.</p>

<p>However, opposition forces like HTS have invested heavily in resources and training for night operations. “That basically levels the playing field,” he added.</p>

<h2><strong>Who controls what in Syria?</strong></h2>

<p>Over a decade-long civil war, an invasion by the terror group Islamic State and several proxy battles have left Syria divided into different power control zones.</p>

<p>President Asaad's government reportedly controls over 60 per cent of the country. But large parts of Syria are still out of the government's control, including opposition-held areas in the northwest and the northeast. These areas are mainly dominated by US-backed Kurdish-led group. Other opposition-controlled areas are in northwest Syria including parts of Idlib and Aleppo provinces, which are home to about 5 million people.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>SARS-CoV-2, the virus behind the Covid-19 pandemic, remains in the skull and meninges for years after infection, leading to a long-lasting effect on the brain, according to a major German study.</p>

<p>Researchers from Helmholtz Munich and Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitat (LMU) found that SARS-CoV-2 spike protein remains in the brain's protective layers -- the meninges, and the skull's bone marrow for up to four years after infection.</p>

<p>These spike proteins are responsible for triggering chronic inflammation in affected individuals and increase the risk of neurodegenerative diseases, the team found.</p>

<p>Prof. Ali Ertürk, Director at the Institute for Intelligent Biotechnologies at Helmholtz Munich said that the long-term neurological effects include “accelerated brain ageing, potentially leading to a loss of five to 10 years of healthy brain function in affected individuals."</p>

<p>The study, published in the journal Cell Host &amp; Microbe, may also have neurological symptoms of long Covid such as headaches, sleep disturbances, and “brain fog,” or cognitive impairment.</p>

<p>About five to 10 per cent of people infected with Covid are likely to experience long Covid -- approximately 400 million individuals may carry a significant amount of the spike protein.</p>

<p>Notably, vaccines against the deadly virus significantly reduce the accumulation of the spike protein in the brain, said the researchers.</p>

<p>However, the reduction was “only around 50 per cent in mice, leaving residual spike protein that continues to pose a toxic risk to the brain”.</p>

<p>For the study, the team developed a novel AI-powered imaging technique to understand how the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein affects the brain.</p>

<p>The method, which offers a three-dimensional visualisation of viral proteins, was deployed to find previously undetectable distributions of spike protein in tissue samples from Covid-19 patients and mice.</p>

<p>The findings revealed significantly elevated concentrations of spike protein in the skull's bone marrow and meninges, even years after infection.</p>

<p>The spike protein binds to so-called ACE2 receptors, particularly abundant in these regions.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A monitor of Syria's war said on Saturday that jihadist rebels now control a majority of Aleppo city, reporting Russian air strikes on parts of Syria's second city for the first time since 2016.</p>

<p>The rebels have pressed a lightning offensive against forces of the Iranian- and Russian-backed Syrian government since Wednesday, the same day a fragile ceasefire took effect in neighbouring Lebanon between Israel and the Iran-backed Hezbollah group, a Damascus ally, after two months of all-out war.</p>

<p>"Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and allied factions... took control of most of the city and government centres and prisons", said the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.</p>

<p>HTS, a jihadist alliance led by Al-Qaeda's former Syria branch, controls swathes of the Idlib region, in Syria's northwest, as well as parts of neighbouring Aleppo, Hama and Latakia provinces.</p>

<p>Overnight, Russian "warplanes launched raids on areas of Aleppo city for the first time since 2016", added the Britain-based Observatory, which relies on a network of sources inside Syria.</p>

<p>It raised the death count in days of clashes to 311 -- 183 from HTS and allied Turkish-backed factions, 100 soldiers and pro-government forces, as well as 28 civilians.</p>

<p>State media reported that four civilians were killed when HTS shelled a student residence in Aleppo, a city of around two million people that was Syria's pre-war manufacturing hub.</p>

<p>Iran-backed militias have a heavy presence in the Aleppo region after providing crucial ground support when the Syrian army -- backed by Russian air power -- recaptured rebel-held areas of the city in 2016.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Cheering</strong></h3>

<p>An AFP correspondent saw rebels celebrating and cheering inside Aleppo late Friday. Another correspondent saw anti-government fighters in front of the city's landmark citadel.</p>

<p>The Observatory said that "the governor of Aleppo and the police and security branch commanders withdrew from the city centre".</p>

<p>The overnight air strikes coincided with "the arrival of large (rebel) military reinforcements" to the area, the Observatory added, after on Friday reporting the jihadists and their allies had taken more than 50 towns and villages in the north.</p>

<p>Army reinforcements have arrived in Aleppo, a Syrian security official told AFP on Friday, requesting anonymity to discuss sensitive matters, while an army statement said troops had repelled the assault on the city and retaken some positions.</p>

<p>Observatory director Rami Abdel Rahman told AFP early Saturday that rebel fighters swiftly captured swathes of Aleppo without meeting significant resistance, adding "there has been no fighting, not a single shot was fired, as regime forces withdrew."</p>

<p>The jihadists and their allies made other advances in the north, including seizure of the strategically located town of Saraqib, on the road to Aleppo about 40 kilometres (25 miles) southwest, the Observatory had said.</p>

<p>The Russian military said Friday it was bombing "extremist" forces, as Turkey demanded a halt to bombardment on the Idlib region.</p>

<p>Since 2020, the Idlib area has been subject to a Turkey and Russia-brokered truce which had largely been holding despite repeated violations.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A video of a kidnapping carried out by a group of men in Australia was presented in Parramatta District Court, New South Wales, on November 28.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A video of a kidnapping carried out by a group of men in Australia was presented in Parramatta District Court, New South Wales, on November 28. The incident, which occurred on January 11, 2023, saw Kodar Faytrouni, Safwan Hussein, Ali Hamad and Abud Elkerdi travel from Melbourne to Guildford to abduct Younis. The motivation behind the attack was linked to Faytrouni's belief that Younis married his sister only to obtain an Australian visa.</p>

<p>The footage, recorded by Hamad, shows Hussein restraining Younis in a headlock inside a vehicle, while Faytrouni sits next to him. Additional clips show Faytrouni assaulting Younis at the residence of the victim's mother before he was transported to another property, as per the <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/29/world-news/shocking-moment-man-gets-kidnapped-by-four-men-including-his-brother-in-law/" rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">NY Post</a>.</p>

<p>The ordeal ended when police intervened and intercepted the men's vehicle. All four defendants have pleaded guilty to taking or detaining a person in the company.</p>

<p>During the sentencing proceedings, Faytrouni's lawyer claimed his client's low intellectual capacity played a role in the “bizarre” nature of the crime. However, Judge Stephen Hanley pointed out that the motive stemmed from Faytrouni's refusal to accept his sister's choice of partner, saying, “It shows a complete failure to allow this woman to select who she wants to have as her partner.” The judge called the act misogynistic and described the crime as deliberate and targeted.</p>

<p>Judge Hanley expressed outrage at the conduct, stating, “They seem to be able to find him, break into his house, extract him from his house, assault him in the car, force him to make a divorce according to Islamic law while his partner listens on the phone with a distressed condition … and you say this is below mid-range (of objective seriousness)? This man and his comrades seem to have a strange attitude towards women.”</p>

<p>Crown prosecutor Adam Muddle explained that Faytrouni believed it was his duty to protect his sister and thought her marriage lacked sincerity. Muddle said, “The Crown submits that this is quite a degree of insight and a degree of knowledge in terms of the motivations in the reasons behind this offending.”</p>

<p>The court proceedings for Faytrouni and Elkerdi were postponed until 20 December, following Elkerdi's hospitalisation after collapsing during the lunch break. Hamad and Hussein are scheduled to reappear in court on 13 December.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 74-year-old fruit vendor is receiving unexpected support after his humble banana was sold for an extraordinary $6.2 million at an auction at Sotheby's. Shah Alam sold the banana for just 35 cents (Rs 29) not realising it would go on to become the centrepiece of Maurizio Cattelan's artwork, ‘Comedian'. The surreal sale of the fruit taped to a gallery wall explores the absurdities of the art world.</p>

<p>Mr Alam, a Bangladeshi immigrant who has lived in the US since 2007, works at a modest fruit stand on the Upper East Side for $12 an hour, selling fresh produce to locals. He had no idea the banana he sold to a visitor at the Sotheby's auction house would become a world-famous item fetching millions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Upon hearing about the sale, he broke down in tears. "I am a poor man," he told a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/nyregion/banana-auction-sothebys.html" rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">New York Times</a> reporter. "I have never had this kind of money; I have never seen this kind of money."</p>

<p>Living in a shared basement apartment in the Bronx, Mr Alam works 12-hour shifts, four days a week, regardless of the weather. Despite the unexpected windfall for the banana, he felt like the joke had been at his expense. “Those who bought it, what kind of people are they?” he asked. “Do they not know what a banana is?”</p>

<p><strong>Read:&nbsp;</strong><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/comedian-banana-taped-to-a-wall-sells-for-6-2-million-in-new-york-7068764">"Comedian", Banana Taped To A Wall, Sells For $6.2 Million In New York</a></p>

<p>Last week's auction saw the banana fetch $5.2 million, with extra fees bringing the total to $6.2 million. The buyer, Chinese cryptocurrency mogul Justin Sun, said he admired Mr Alam's role in the work.</p>

<p>Mr Sun, whose net worth is estimated to be over $1.4 billion, has also announced that he plans to buy 1 lakh bananas from Mr Alam's stand as a gesture of gratitude. "To thank Mr Shah Alam, I've decided to buy 100,000 bananas from his stand in New York's Upper East Side,” Mr Sun wrote on X. “These bananas will be distributed free worldwide through his stand.”</p>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Mr Sun's support was not the only sign of solidarity. An anonymous New Yorker launched <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-the-comedian-banana-vendor-shah-alam " rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">a GoFundMe campaign</a> to help Mr Alam.</p>

<p>"Do we really want to live in a city where we can shrug off a street vendor who's moved to tears...while celebrating some smartass for figuring out how to make $6 million from that joke?” the campaign's organiser, known only as "JS," wrote. The fundraiser quickly raised over $15,296 (Rs 12.93 lakh), with JS promising to directly deliver the money to Mr Alam.</p>

<p>"I will walk to the fruit stand myself next week (after Thanksgiving) and take a video of me handing him the money myself," JS wrote. "If I don't find him, GoFundMe will return your money."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Houston Police Department has released a horrifying dashcam video showing the moment a 41-year-old woman was mowed down by a police officer in front of her screaming children. The incident took place on September 19, 2024, and the dashcam and body camera video were made public on Wednesday, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://abc13.com/post/hpd-releases-footage-showing-moment-when-officer-hit-killed-desire-pool-front-children-antoine-pinemont/15596601/" rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">ABC 13</a> reported.</p>

<p>The newly released footage shows the woman, Desire Pool, getting hit by the Houston Police cruiser while she was crossing the street alongside her son and daughter. The incident was reported at around 10 PM. Meanwhile, it also features a fourth person standing on an island in the middle of the street.</p>

<p>Officer Shelby Kennedy was travelling along Antoine near Pinemont when she drove at full speed into a group at 9:52 PM on September 19.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-media-max-width="560">

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>As the family saw the vehicle coming, everyone somehow jumped out of the way, except for Desire Pool.</p>

<p>Officer Joshua Rosales, who is Kennedy's partner, is heard screaming at her as he sits in the passenger's seat of the vehicle.</p>

<p>"Whoa, Whoa, Whoa. Oh, my...God! You didn't see them?" Rosales shouted immediately after Pool was hit by the vehicle.</p>

<p>Kennedy said, "No."</p>

<p>"Oh my... God, Kennedy," Rosales said.</p>

<p>A video of Kennedy's body camera later shows the victim's children screaming at them and crying, while the two officers tried to administer CPR and called for an ambulance to the accident spot.</p>

<p>Pool was immediately rushed to a nearby hospital but was soon pronounced dead, authorities said.</p>

<p>"My mom! Y'all killed my mom," one of her children can be heard screaming at the officers in the video.</p>

<p>At the time of the incident, the officers were transporting an arrested suspect to the Joint Processing Center, the early investigation revealed.</p>

<p>While they have not released details about how fast the officer was driving, investigators don't believe speed was a factor in the accident and have stated that Pool was not standing in a crosswalk at the time of the crash.</p>

<p>The victim's family from Illinois claimed the police officials did not show them the footage earlier before releasing it in public. They feel that its timing is insensitive.</p>

<p>"I'm really upset, surprised, and horrified at the way the accident went down. For this to come out a day before Thanksgiving that's disrespectful. It's the lowest thing you can do. It's like putting salt in a wound," Pool's uncle Lee Gordon said.</p>

<p>Gordon said Pool has left behind four children, two of whom are dealing with the trauma of witnessing their mother's killing.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cybersecurity experts have alerted Netflix users against an SMS phishing campaign being used to steal account and credit card information. Hackers are sending this phishing text, claiming the concerned person has not paid for their subscription and that their account will be suspended soon, the <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/29/tech/netflix-users-warned-about-scare-scam-that-could-steal-credit-card-information/ " rel="nofollow noindex" target="_blank">New York Post </a>reported.</p>

<p>"These SMS scare campaigns targeting Netflix customers have become ubiquitous and never stop, but they vary in size and scope," said security firm Bitdefender.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"NETFLIX: There was an issue processing your payment. To keep your services active, please sign in and confirm your details at..." reads one such alert. There is a link that directs viewers to a website that looks identical to the Netflix platform and asks for their credit card number and login credentials.</p>

<p>These stolen credentials are sold to underground rings on the dark web.</p>

<p>Netflix's lack of two-factor authentication protections has made the scam easier to spread in as many as 23 countries, including the US. The streaming platform is vulnerable to spear phishing as it only relies on usernames and passwords for security.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Netflix, in a statement about the text messages scam, said, "We will never ask you to enter your personal information in a text or email. We will never request payment through a 3rd party vendor or website. If the text or email links to a URL that you don't recognize, don't tap or click it."&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you have already clicked any of these links, the streaming giant suggests changing your Netflix password to a new one that is strong and unique. It also suggests updating your password on any other websites or apps where you used the same email and password combination.</p>

<p>Bitdefender, a cybersecurity firm, advises users to avoid opening suspicious links and manually enter websites rather than clicking links without verifying in order to prevent falling for scams.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Earlier this week, a British man won the third-largest lottery of all time by pocketing 177 million pounds (Rs 1804.16 crore) in the Euromillions jackpot. According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c154jn0gd0eo" rel="noindex, nofollow">BBC</a>, if the winner is an individual rather than a syndicate splitting the prize-he or she will immediately become richer than musicians Harry Styles and Adele, who featured on this year's Sunday Times Rich List with fortunes of 175 million pounds and 170 million pounds, respectively.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A chaotic scene unfolded at Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) on November 10 when a passenger lashed out at an airport staff member and it led to a physical confrontation. The incident, caught on camera, occurred reportedly due to a dispute over check-in procedures.</p>

<p>Assistant Commissioner Azman Shariat, the District Police Chief, described the episode to The Star as a result of a “misunderstanding” following the passenger's tardiness during the check-in process, which quickly escalated into an altercation. Shariat said the staff member sustained minor injuries, but no arrests had been made at the time of reporting.<br />
<br />
“The incident stemmed from a misunderstanding between the two after the passenger was late during the checking-in process. This then led to a fight and the worker was slightly injured,” <a href="https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2024/11/16/misunderstanding-leads-to-fistfight-at-klia-says-cops" rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">The Star</a>&nbsp;quoted Shariat as saying.</p>

<p>The footage, shared by Viral Press, shows the passenger striking the employee, prompting a flurry of reactions from onlookers. Security personnel intervened to separate the pair, after which the employee, visibly shaken, pointed at the passenger as he was escorted away from the scene.</p>

<p>This confrontation adds to the troubling trend of passenger aggression at airports and on flights. Recent months have seen a number of similar incidents.<br />
<br />
Earlier, <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/air-india-cabin-crew-member-assaulted-in-her-london-hotel-room-6361859">an Air India cabin crew member was allegedly assaulted </a>in her hotel room in London. The airline confirmed the incident, describing it as an "unlawful intrusion" and the crew member was offered immediate assistance and professional counselling. The attack occurred at a Heathrow hotel, and a suspect, believed to be a Nigerian citizen, was arrested.<br />
<br />
Before that, <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/spicejet-employee-slaps-cop-at-airport-alleges-inappropriate-behaviour-6085246">a SpiceJet employee was arrested after slapping a CISF assistant </a>sub-inspector during a security screening altercation at Jaipur airport. The incident happened early in the morning when the employee was stopped for not having permission to enter through a specific gate. An argument broke out when she was asked to go to another entrance for screening, but no female CISF officer was available. SpiceJet claimed the employee was verbally harassed by the CISF officer and took legal action. Police charged her with assaulting a public servant.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Pete Hegseth, Donald Trump’s pick for defence secretary, faces accusations from his mother of a ‘lack of character’ due to his behaviour towards women.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The mother of Pete Hegseth, US President-elect Donald Trump's choice for Secretary of Defence, accused him of mistreating women over the years and exhibiting a lack of moral character. The 2018 email, made public by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/29/us/politics/pete-hegseth-mother-email.html" rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">The New York Times</a>, painted a damning picture of his character.</p>

<p>“On behalf of all the women (and I know it's many) you have abused in some way, I say...get some help and take an honest look at yourself,” Penelope Hegseth wrote.</p>

<p>She added, “You are an abuser of women — that is the ugly truth and I have no respect for any man that belittles, lies, cheats, sleeps around, and uses women for his power and ego. You are that man (and have been for years) and as your mother, it pains me and embarrasses me to say that, but it is the sad, sad truth.”</p>

<p>Penelope Hegseth, speaking to The New York Times, acknowledged that she later sent an apologetic follow-up to Pete. “I fired off that original email in anger, with emotion,” she said, attributing the tone to the difficult circumstances surrounding her son's divorce from his second wife, Samantha.</p>

<p>The email's tone was scathing as Penelope criticised Pete for his treatment of Samantha. She wrote, “I have tried to keep quiet about your character and behaviour, but after listening to the way you made Samantha feel today, I cannot stay silent. And as a woman and your mother I feel I must speak out.”</p>

<p>She added, “Sam is a good mother and a good person (under the circumstances that you created) and I know deep down you know that. For you to try to label her as ‘unstable' for your own advantage is despicable and abusive. Is there any sense of decency left in you?”</p>

<p>Towards the end, she wrote, “We still love you, but we are broken by your behaviour and lack of character.”</p>

<p>Hegseth, a former Fox News contributor and veteran of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, has been embroiled in controversy following Trump's nomination. The accusations in the email are particularly significant in the context of Hegseth's anticipated Senate confirmation hearings, where his character will be closely scrutinised. Reports of infidelity and a rape complaint dating back to 2017, which was not pursued by authorities, have already attracted attention, according to The New York Times. Hegseth has maintained the complaint was a false accusation by a woman he had a consensual relationship with and reportedly paid a settlement to protect his career.</p>

<p>At the time, Hegseth was navigating an acrimonious divorce process. Samantha, the mother of three of his children, filed for divorce after discovering Pete had fathered a child with Jennifer Rauchet, a colleague at Fox News.</p>

<p>In response to questions about the publication of the email, Steven Cheung, a spokesperson for President-elect Trump, accused The New York Times of releasing “an out-of-context snippet” and emphasised that Penelope Hegseth had apologised for the message.</p>

<p>The former couple's divorce, which was finalised in 2019, included disputes over parenting time that required court-appointed mediation. Pete Hegseth later stated that he regretted derogatory texts sent to Samantha, pledging to communicate more respectfully moving forward.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Beijing court on Friday sentenced veteran Chinese state media journalist Dong Yuyu to seven years in prison on espionage charges, his family said.</p>

<p>Dong, a senior columnist at the Communist Party newspaper Guangming Daily, was detained in February 2022 along with a Japanese diplomat at a Beijing restaurant.</p>

<p>The diplomat was released after a few hours of questioning, but Dong, 62, was charged with spying last year.</p>

<p>"The Beijing No. 2 Intermediate People's Court convicted Yuyu of espionage, a crime that requires that the prosecution prove that the defendant knowingly acted on behalf of 'espionage organisations' and their agents," according to a statement shared by his family with AFP.</p>

<p>According to the judgement, the Japanese diplomats Dong met with, including then-ambassador Hideo Tarumi and current Shanghai-based chief diplomat Masaru Okada, were named as agents of an "espionage organisation", the family statement added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We are shocked that the Chinese authorities would blatantly deem a foreign embassy as an 'espionage organisation' and accuse the former Japanese ambassador and his fellow diplomats of being spies," Dong's family said.</p>

<p>On Friday, Beijing's foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning responded to Dong's case by saying "China is a country ruled by law".</p>

<p>The Japanese embassy told AFP that it would not comment directly on the case.</p>

<p>But an embassy spokesperson told AFP in an email: "The diplomatic activities of Japanese diplomatic missions abroad are carried out in a legitimate manner."&nbsp;</p>

<p>In Washington, State Department Spokesman Matthew Miller condemned Dong's jailing and called for his immediate release.</p>

<p>"His arrest and today's sentencing highlight the PRC's failure to live up to its commitments under international law and its own constitutional guarantees to all its citizens, which include the right to freedom of speech and freedom of the press," Miller said in a statement referring to China by its official name, the People's Republic of China.</p>

<p>The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) condemned the "unjust verdict" and called for Dong's immediate release.</p>

<p>"Interacting with diplomats is part of a journalist's job," the NGO's Asia program coordinator Beh Lih Yi said in an email to AFP.</p>

<p>"This sentencing cements China's position as the world's leading jailer of journalists," added Yi.</p>

<p>Under Chinese law, a person convicted of espionage can be jailed for three to 10 years for less severe cases or receive heavy punishment, including life imprisonment, for serious cases.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Algerian boxer Imane Khelif, who failed a gender eligibility test last year, knocked their Italian opponent out in 46 seconds in the 66 kg women's boxing category and has drawn the ire of Italian Prime Minister Georgia Meloni, who said the fight was "not on an equal footing".</p>

<p>A boxing round lasts 3 minutes and there are three rounds in each. Italian Angela Carini was distraught, she collapsed on her knees and sobbed in the middle of the ring after the defeat and did not shake hands with Khelif.</p>

<p>The Algerian boxer landed two strong punches, knocking Carini out. The Italian boxer was unable to stand after her nose was badly hit. The win took Khelif to the quarterfinals in the category.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I have a big pain in my nose and I said, 'Stop'. It's better to avoid keeping going. My nose started dripping (with blood) from the first hit," said the distressed Carini.</p>

<p>Italy's Prime Minister said "I think athletes who have male genetic characteristics should not be admitted to women's competitions. And not because you want to discriminate against someone, but to protect the right of female athletes to be able to compete on equal terms.</p>

<p>"I was emotional yesterday when she wrote 'I will fight' because the dedication, the head, and the character, surely also play a role in these things. But then, it also matters to be able to compete on equal grounds and from my point of view it was not an even contest."</p>

<p><strong>What Is The Controversy?</strong></p>

<p>The International Olympic Committee allowed two boxers, who failed the gender eligibility tests for the World Boxing Championships, to be made eligible to compete in the 2024 Paris Olympics. The Algerian boxer was disqualified hours before her gold medal match at the women's World Championships in Delhi.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Algerian media reported that Khelif was disqualified for a high level of testosterone in her system.</p>

<p>Taiwan's double world champion Lin Yu-ting also lost her bronze medal at the same competition after she too failed to meet the criteria.</p>

<p>Umar Kremlev, Amateur Boxing President, told Russian news agency TASS that the DNA tests of two boxers proved they have XY chromosomes and were thus excluded." XY is the male chromosome and XX is for females.</p>

<p>Reem Alsalem, the UN special rapporteur on violence against women and girls, wrote on X that "Angela Carini rightly followed her instincts and prioritized her physical safety, but she and other female athletes should not have been exposed to this physical and psychological violence based on their sex."</p>

<p></p>

Violence based on their sex.</p>

<p>The World Championships were organised by the International Boxing Association (IBA) and were not recognised by the International Olympic Committee over financial transparency.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://olympics.com/ioc/news/ioc-statement-on-the-international-boxing-association-iba">The IOC said the source of the prize money</a> at the International Boxing Association was unclear and is one of the reasons why they withdrew its recognition of the IBA.</p>

<p>"The IBA was not prepared to transparently explain the sources of its financing or to explain its full financial dependency, at the time, on a single state-owned company, Gazprom," IOC said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The boxing competition at the Paris Olympics is being organised by the Paris Boxing Unit (PBU), an ad-hoc unit of the IOC's Executive Board.&nbsp;</p>

<p>IOC spokesman, Mark Adams, said "Everyone competing in the women's category is complying with competition eligibility rules. They are women in their passports and it's stated in there that they are female."&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Nations Back Their Boxers</strong></p>

<p>As expected, the Algerian and Taiwanese boxers have received backing from their nations' leaders. Taiwan President Lai Ching-te said, "Yu-ting's performances have inspired many Taiwanese players and united Taiwanese people. Now that she is once again on the international stage, we should stand united and cheer for her."</p>

<p>Alegria's Olympic committee called it a "malicious and unethical attack directed against our distinguished athlete, Imane Khelif, by certain foreign media".</p>

<p>The IBA in a statement clarified that Khelif initially appealed the decision of the IBA's ruling at the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) but later withdrew it during the process, making their decision legally binding.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, Lin Yu-ting did not appeal the decision thus rendering it legally binding.</p>

<p>"The IOC's differing regulations on these matters, in which IBA is not involved, raise serious questions about both competitive fairness and athletes' safety. For clarification on why the IOC permits athletes with competitive advantages to compete in their events, we urge interested parties to seek answers directly from the IOC," <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.iba.sport/news/statement-made-by-the-international-boxing-association-regarding-athletes-disqualifications-in-world-boxing-championships-2023/">the IBA said</a>.</p>

<p><strong>'Why You're Ok With A Man Beating A Woman'</strong></p>

<p>The author of Harry Potter, JK Rowling, voiced her opinion on the gender row during the match and said, "Explain why you're OK with a man beating a woman in public for your entertainment. This isn't sport. From the bullying cheat in red up to the organisers who allowed this to happen, this is men revelling in their power over women."</p>

<p>Kirsty Burrows, the Head of the Safe Sport Unit at the IOC, in a press briefing, said, "Paris Olympics 2024 offers the most comprehensive package of mental health and safeguarding initiatives than any other Olympic or sporting event in history."&nbsp;</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>India and Vietnam today adopted an action plan to expand their strategic ties with Prime Minister Narendra Modi vowing to work jointly for a rules-based Indo-Pacific and asserting that New Delhi supports development and "not expansionism" in remarks that came amid concerns over China's military posturing in the region.</p>

<p>The two sides signed six memorandums of understanding (MoUs) and finalised three other documents to broadbase cooperation in a range of areas following wide-ranging talks between PM Modi and Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh.</p>

<p>It was also decided that India will provide USD 300 million credit line to Vietnam primarily to strengthen the Southeast Asian nation's maritime security.</p>

<p>An agreement was sealed between the central banks of the two countries for rolling out digital payment connectivity.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Chinh arrived in New Delhi on Tuesday night on a three-day visit that is aimed at further expanding the comprehensive strategic ties between the two countries.</p>

<p>"In our Act East policy and our Indo-Pacific vision, Vietnam is our important partner... We support development, not expansionism <em>(Hum vistarbad nahi, vikasvad ka samarthan karte hei)</em>," PM Modi said in Hindi in his media statement.</p>

<p>"We will continue our cooperation for a free, open, rules-based and prosperous Indo-Pacific," he said.</p>

<p>PM Modi said that both sides decided that cooperation will be strengthened to deal with terrorism and cyber security issues.</p>

<p>"We believe that 'Developed India 2047' and Vietnam's 'Vision 2045' have accelerated development in both countries. This is opening up many new areas of mutual cooperation," PM Modi said.</p>

<p>"And therefore, to further strengthen our Comprehensive Strategic Partnership, today we have adopted a new plan of action," he said.</p>

<p>PM Modi said new steps have been taken for cooperation in the field of defence and security.</p>

<p>The two prime ministers also remotely inaugurated an Army Software Park at Telecommunications University Nha Trang. It has been built with New Delhi's development assistance.</p>

<p>"The agreed USD 300 million credit line will strengthen Vietnam's maritime security," PM Modi said.</p>

<p>"We agree that, to realise the mutual trade potential, the review of the ASEAN-India Trade in Goods Agreement should be concluded as early as possible," he said.</p>

<p>Vietnam is a key member of 10-nation ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations).</p>

<p>"We have decided to focus on the areas of green economy and new emerging technologies. Each other's capabilities in energy and port development will be harnessed for mutual benefit," PM Modi said.</p>

<p>The prime minister also invited people from Vietnam to the Buddhist circuit in India. "And we want the youth of Vietnam to also take advantage of Nalanda University." In his remarks, Modi said India-Vietnam relations have both "expanded and deepened" over the past decade.</p>

<p>"In the last 10 years, we have transformed our relations into a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership. Our bilateral trade has increased by more than 85 percent," he said.</p>

<p>"Mutual cooperation has expanded in energy, technology, and development partnership. Mutual cooperation in defence and security areas has gained new momentum," he said.</p>

<p>"Over the past decade, connectivity has increased. And today we have more than 50 direct flights between us. Along with this, tourism is continuously increasing, and people have also been given the facility of e-visa," PM Modi said.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[US journalist Evan Gershkovich and former US marine Paul Whelan are expected to be released by Russia as part of one of the biggest East-West prisoner swaps since the Cold War, according to US media Thursday.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US journalist Evan Gershkovich and former US marine Paul Whelan were released from Russia Thursday, the Turkish government announced, in one of the biggest East-West prisoner swaps since the Cold War.</p>

<p>A total of 26 people, including two minors, from the United States, Germany, Poland, Slovenia, Norway, Belarus and Russia were involved in the swap "carried out" by Turkey's MIT intelligence service, Turkey's presidency said.</p>

<p>There was no immediate confirmation from US officials, although the swap was widely reported by US television networks. The Kremlin declined to comment on any exchange.</p>

<p>Wall Street Journal reporter Gershkovich, 32, was detained in Russia in March 2023 and convicted in July on spying charges in a fast-track trial denounced as a sham by the United States.</p>

<p>Among those being returned to Russia in exchange, the Turkish government said, is Vadim Krasikov, a Russian citizen imprisoned in Germany for killing a former Chechen rebel commander in a brazen assassination.</p>

<p>Signs of an imminent prisoner swap had picked up momentum earlier Thursday, amid reports a plane used in a previous exchange deal had landed in the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad.</p>

<p>Hopes had also risen in recent days after a number of high-profile prisoners in Russia, including Whelan, went missing from facilities where they were serving long terms, fueling speculation they were being moved ahead of an exchange.</p>

<p>As a rule, swaps can only happen after a conviction in Russia, and the disappearance of several high-profile political prisoners at once is extremely rare.</p>

<p>The exchange would be a victory for US President Joe Biden, whose vice president, Kamala Harris, will face Republican Donald Trump in the November election.</p>

<p>This would be the first prisoner exchange between Russia and the West since star US basketball player Brittney Griner was swapped in return for convicted Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout in December 2022.</p>

<p>It would also be the biggest exchange since 2010, when 14 alleged spies were exchanged between Russia and the West. They included double agent Sergei Skripal, who was sent by Moscow to Britain and undercover Russian agent Anna Chapman, sent by Washington to Russia.</p>

<p>Before then, major swaps involving more than a dozen people had only taken place during the Cold War, with Soviet and Western powers carrying out exchanges in 1985 and 1986.</p>

<p><strong>'Pushing hard'</strong></p>

<p>An aircraft already used in Griner and Bout's exchange flew from Moscow to Kaliningrad early Thursday, according to flight tracking website Flightradar24. The flight was later tracked taking off from Kaliningrad two hours later.</p>

<p>Gershkovich was arrested in the city of Yekaterinburg while on a reporting trip. He, his employer and the US government all strongly denied the espionage allegations against him.</p>

<p>Biden had said after the sentencing that he was "pushing hard for Evan's release and will continue to do so."</p>

<p>Media rights group Reporters Without Borders said it was "hugely relieved."</p>

<p>"The Russian government's continued policy of state hostage-taking is outrageous. Journalists are not spies, and they must never be targeted for political purposes," the group said.</p>

<p>Washington has also been working for the release of Whelan, 54, who was arrested in 2018 in Moscow and charged with espionage.</p>

<p>Whelan was working in security for a US vehicle parts company when he was arrested, and has always asserted that the evidence against him was falsified.</p>

<p>Also among those who disappeared was journalist and activist Vladimir Kara-Murza, a 42-year-old joint Russian and British citizen. His lawyers said on Wednesday that they did not know his location after being twice denied access to the facility where he was meant to be held.</p>

<p>Kara-Murza, who spoke out against the Russian invasion of Ukraine, is serving a 25-year sentence in Siberia for treason and other charges. He suffers from a nerve disease and was moved to a prison hospital earlier this month for medical checks.</p>

<p>Adding to the intrigue was a case in Slovenia, where a court sentenced two Russians suspected of spying for Moscow to more than a year and a half in prison -- but then ordered their expulsion from the country.</p>

<p>Arrests of US citizens in Russia have increased in recent years, in what Washington sees as a Kremlin attempt to secure the release of Russians convicted abroad.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After members of the Palestinian group Hamas carried out the worst attack in Israeli history, on October 7, 2023, Israel responded with a devastating military campaign in the Gaza Strip.</p>

<p>The air and ground operation has killed at least 39,480 people, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-ruled territory, which does not give details of civilian and militant deaths.</p>

<p>AFP looks back at key moments in the war.</p>

<p><strong>Hamas attacks</strong></p>

<p>At dawn on October 7, hundreds of Hamas fighters infiltrate Israel.</p>

<p>They kill civilians in the streets, in their homes and at a desert music festival, and attack troops in army bases.</p>

<p>They seize 251 hostages and take them back to Gaza, with 111 still detained including 39 the military says are dead.</p>

<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vows to destroy Hamas, which is considered a terrorist organisation by the United States, European Union and Israel.</p>

<p><strong>North Gaza exodus</strong></p>

<p>Israel begins bombing and besieging Gaza. On October 13, it calls on civilians in northern Gaza to move south ahead of an expected ground offensive.</p>

<p>By the end of July only 14 percent of areas in Gaza were not covered by evacuation orders, the head of the UN's agency for Palestinian refugees says, and the UN reports around 90 percent of Gazans are displaced.</p>

<p><strong>Ground invasion</strong></p>

<p>On October 27, Israel launches a ground offensive.</p>

<p>On November 15, Israeli troops raid Al-Shifa hospital, Gaza's biggest medical facility, where Israel claims Hamas has a command centre, something Hamas denies.</p>

<p><strong>Truce and hostage swap</strong></p>

<p>On November 24, a week-long truce between Israel and Hamas goes into effect.</p>

<p>Hamas releases 80 Israeli hostages in return for 240 Palestinians held in Israeli prisons. Twenty-five other hostages, mainly Thai farm workers, are also set free outside the deal.</p>

<p>Israel allows more aid into Gaza during the pause but the humanitarian situation in the besieged territory remains dire.</p>

<p>When the war resumes, Israel expands its actions into southern Gaza.</p>

<p><strong>Call to prevent 'genocide'</strong></p>

<p>In an interim ruling on January 26 in a case brought by South Africa, the International Court of Justice orders Israel to do "everything" to prevent any acts of genocide.</p>

<p><strong>Deadly food stampede</strong></p>

<p>On February 29, Israeli forces open fire on residents of northern Gaza who rush towards a convoy of food aid trucks, saying they believed they "posed a threat".</p>

<p>Gaza's health ministry says 120 people were shot dead and hundreds wounded, calling it a "massacre".</p>

<p>Israel's military says most of the victims were trampled or run over by the trucks.</p>

<p>From early March several countries, including the United States, drop aid over Gaza which the United Nations says faces famine. A first aid ship from Cyprus arrives on March 15.</p>

<p><strong>Aid workers killed</strong></p>

<p>On April 1, seven aid workers from the US charity World Central Kitchen are killed in an Israeli strike, which the military claims was a "tragic mistake".</p>

<p>Netanyahu repeatedly threatens to send ground troops to Rafah, Gaza's southernmost city where a majority of the territory's 2.4 million people have sought shelter.</p>

<p><strong>Iran attacks Israel</strong></p>

<p>Fears of a regional overspill are stoked on April 13 when Iran pounds Israel with drones and missiles in retaliation for a deadly April 1 strike on Iran's Damascus consulate, blamed on Israel.</p>

<p>On April 19, strikes target central Iran, which plays down the incidents without blaming Israel. Israel does not claim responsibility.</p>

<p><strong>Operations in the south</strong></p>

<p>On May 7, Israel's army launches its offensive on Rafah, where the United Nations says up to 1.4 million are sheltering, and takes control of the border crossing with Egypt effectively blocking a key entry point for aid.</p>

<p>A strike overnight May 26-27 is blamed for starting a fire in a tent camp, killing 45 people, Gaza authorities say. Israel says two senior Hamas operatives were targeted.</p>

<p>During eight days in July, Israel's army targets five schools sheltering displaced people, leaving dozens dead, Hamas and Gaza sources say.</p>

<p>On July 13, a strike near Khan Yunis kills 92, and 70 others perish on July 22, Hamas says.</p>

<p><strong>Regional flare up feared&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Yemen's Iran-backed Huthi rebels who have carried out 90 attacks on shipping in the Gulf since November in solidarity with Gaza claim on July 19 a rare drone attack on Tel Aviv that kills one.</p>

<p>The next day Israel bombards Yemen Huthi-controlled port of Hodeida, causing a huge fire at the strategic facility and killing six, the rebels say.</p>

<p>At the Israeli-Lebanon border, almost daily exchanges of gunfire since October between the Israeli army and the Lebanese Islamist group Hezbollah, intensify in July.</p>

<p>On July 27, a rocket strike kills 12 youths in the Druze Arab town of Majdal Shams in the Israeli-annexed Golan Heights.</p>

<p>Israel blames the strike on Hezbollah, which denies the claim.</p>

<p>Israel retaliates with several strikes, including one Tuesday on Beirut's southern suburbs that kills Fuad Shukr, a top Hezbollah commander, the group says, and five civilians.</p>

<p>On July 31, Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh is killed in a strike in Iran. The operation is blamed on Israel, which declines comment.</p>

<p>On August 1, Israel confirms that Hamas military chief Mohammed Deif had been killed in a July strike on Gaza.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The e-commerce giant's capital investments - mostly for building cloud and generative AI infrastructure - is expected to have risen 43% in the second quarter to $16.41 billion, according to LSEG data. That represents a roughly $1.5 billion increase from the previous three months.</p>

<p>The steep spending is also expected to pressure Amazon's margins, outweighing benefits from cost cuts and supply chain efficiencies that are aiding the retail unit's profitability.</p>

<p>The company's Amazon Web Services (AWS) business has long dominated the cloud-computing market, but it has been facing tough competition from Microsoft in recent quarters after the Windows maker rolled out AI-powered services to its Azure cloud business.</p>

<p>In response, Amazon has partnered with the likes of Anthropic and offered startups free credits that cover the cost of using major AI models to boost the market share of its AI platform Bedrock. It also named a new head for the AWS unit in May.</p>

<p>Microsoft and Google-parent Alphabet also said earlier this month they would plow ahead with investments even as the payoff from AI takes longer than some investors had hoped. This knocked Big Tech stocks whose valuations have soared this year on the promise of AI.</p>

<p>"Amazon's capex spend will certainly be scrutinized closely. It has been slow on the adoption of AI and is skewed towards smaller companies which have struggled in the high interest-rate environment," said Ben Barringer, analyst at Quilter Cheviot.</p>

<p>"We would expect AWS to start speeding things up in its AI development going forward."</p>

<p>Amazon shares have risen about 23% this year. The stock has shed more than 6% since July 8, when it hit a record, part of a broader market selloff led by U.S. megacaps.</p>

<p>Growth at AWS is likely to have stayed similar to the previous quarter at just over 17%, according to LSEG data. But, Morgan Stanley analysts said: "AWS needs to grow 18%+ in order to ... ensure investors of AWS's (AI) positioning and its ability to generate high-teens growth through this heavy capex investment period."</p>

<p>As a result of the spending increase, Amazon's gross profit margin growth is expected to have slowed to 1.3% in the April-June quarter, compared with 2.6% in the previous quarter and an average of 2.7% over the past two years.</p>

<p>Growth in its North American retail business likely slowed to 8% between April and June, from 12.3% in the January-March quarter, amid signs of a wider slowdown in consumer spending and some competition from new and fast-growing Chinese players such as Temu and Tiktok Shop that are enticing more U.S. shoppers.</p>

<p>Amazon's total revenue is expected to have grown 10.6% to $148.56 billion - the slowest rise in five quarters.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Japan has expanded its commercial whaling to include fin whales, the second-largest animal species on the planet, a decision criticised by Australia's government on Thursday.</p>

<p>One of only three countries to hunt whales commercially, along with Norway and Iceland, Japan added fin whales to a catch list that already includes minke, Bryde's and sei whales.</p>

<p>"Essentially, our rationale is that there are sufficient resources" of fin whales, a fisheries agency official told AFP on Thursday of the plan to hunt 59 of them this year.</p>

<p>Fin whales are deemed "vulnerable" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Japan's decision, mooted by authorities for months but only made official on Wednesday, has alarmed animal rights activists.</p>

<p>Australia is "deeply disappointed", environment minister Tanya Plibersek said in a statement.</p>

<p>"Australia is opposed to all commercial whaling and urges all countries to end this practice," she said.</p>

<p>It comes as international drama surrounds prominent anti-whaling activist Paul Watson, who was arrested in Greenland last month.</p>

<p>Watson, the 73-year-old American-Canadian founder of the activist group Sea Shepherd, was detained under an international arrest warrant issued by Tokyo.</p>

<p>Denmark's justice ministry -- Greenland is an autonomous Danish territory -- said on Thursday that it has received a formal extradition request from Japan for Watson.</p>

<p>He was arrested after docking to refuel in Greenland's capital on the way to "intercept" Japan's new whaling factory vessel in the North Pacific, according to the Captain Paul Watson Foundation.</p>

<p>The Kangei Maru, a 9,300-tonne mothership that set off from Japan in May, processes whales caught by smaller vessels and stores their meat for consumption in Japan.</p>

<p>Japan has hunted whales for centuries and the meat was a key source of protein in the years after World War II.</p>

<p>It carried on hunting whales for "scientific" purposes after an International Whaling Commission (IWC) moratorium on commercial whaling, killing hundreds in the Antarctic and North Pacific.</p>

<p>However, after years of tensions that took a toll on its international reputation, Japan quit the IWC in 2019 and resumed commercial whaling inside its territorial waters and exclusive economic zone.</p>

<p>Japan killed 294 whales last year, a number it says is sustainable.</p>

<p>A panel of experts commissioned by the agriculture ministry said in June that Japanese fishermen should be able to hunt fin whales.</p>

<p>Agriculture minister Tetsushi Sakamoto at the time called whales "an important food resource".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At least 30 people are dead and 35 are missing in central China, state media reported Thursday, following days of torrential rain that lashed the country earlier this week.</p>

<p>The downpours were triggered by Typhoon Gaemi, which moved on from the Philippines and Taiwan to make landfall in eastern China a week ago, with hilly, landlocked Hunan province hit particularly hard.</p>

<p>More than 11,000 people had been evacuated from the city of Zixing after some areas endured record rainfall of 645 millimetres (25 inches) in just 24 hours, state news agency Xinhua reported on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Many roads connecting townships in the Zixing area were temporarily cut off by the extreme weather, which also affected the power supply and communications infrastructure.</p>

<p>On Thursday, state broadcaster CCTV said that "the roads, electricity and communications in eight towns in Zixing city that were most severely affected by Typhoon Gaemi have basically opened".</p>

<p>"Initial findings show that there have been 30 deaths and 35 are missing," the report said, adding that search and rescue efforts were still ongoing.</p>

<p>On Tuesday Xinhua said four people had been killed and three people were missing in Zixing.</p>

<p>Three people were killed in Hunan's Yongxing county, Xinhua said Tuesday, while a landslide on Sunday killed 15 people elsewhere in the province.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chinese weather authorities said Thursday July was the country's hottest month since records began six decades ago, as extreme temperatures persist across the globe.</p>

<p>China is the world's biggest emitter of the greenhouse gases that scientists say are driving climate change and making extreme weather more frequent and intense.</p>

<p>Heatwaves this summer have scorched parts of northern China, while torrential rains have triggered floods and landslides in central and southern areas.</p>

<p>Last month was "the hottest July since complete observations began in 1961, and the hottest single month in the history of observation", the national weather office said Thursday.</p>

<p>It said the average air temperature in China in July was 23.21 degrees Celsius (73.78 degrees Fahrenheit), exceeding the previous record of 23.17C (73.71F) in 2017.</p>

<p>The mean temperature in every province was also "higher than the average for previous years", with the southwestern provinces of Guizhou and Yunnan logging their highest averages, the weather office said.</p>

<p>It forecast that the mercury would continue to climb in eastern regions this week, including Shanghai, where a red alert for extreme heat was in place on Thursday.</p>

<p>"Next week will be more of the same. It's like being on an iron plate," wrote one user of the Weibo social media platform in response to the megacity's heat warning.</p>

<p>"It's so hot. Did Shanghai do something to anger the gods?" quipped another.</p>

<p>The nearby city of Hangzhou may hit 43C (109F) on Saturday, which would break its all-time record, the weather office said.</p>

<p>Middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River would likely see daily temperatures fall no lower than 30C (86F), it said.</p>

<p>As a result, people "must not relax efforts to avoid the heat and keep cool".</p>

<h3><strong>Extreme summer</strong></h3>

<p>The report came little more than a week after Earth experienced its warmest day in recorded history.</p>

<p>Preliminary data from the Copernicus Climate Change Service showed the daily global average temperature was 17.15C (62.9F) on July 22.</p>

<p>That was 0.06C hotter than the day before, which itself broke the all-time high temperature set a year earlier by a small margin.</p>

<p>China has pledged to bring emissions of carbon dioxide to a peak by 2030 and to net zero by 2060, but has resisted calls to be bolder.</p>

<p>It long depended on highly polluting coal power to fuel its massive economy but has emerged as a renewable energy leader in recent years.</p>

<p>Research showed last month that China is building almost twice as much wind and solar energy capacity than every other country combined.</p>

<p>Extreme weather across large parts of the country has triggered deadly natural disasters in the past few weeks.</p>

<p>State media reported Tuesday that at least seven people had died after heavy rain and flooding hit central Hunan province.</p>

<p>The downpours have been caused by the remnants of <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/7-dead-3-missing-after-heavy-rain-floods-hit-china-report-6222590" target="_blank">Typhoon Gaemi,</a> which made landfall in eastern China last week.</p>

<p>A landslide in Hunan on Sunday destroyed a guesthouse and killed 15 people, while nearly 4,000 residents were evacuated after a dam breach elsewhere in the province.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A woman in the US learned about her $207,199 (Rs 1.73 crore) lottery win through an email in her Spam folder. The 54-year-old woman, who preferred to remain nameless, told lottery officials she was wary of the email since it was discovered as a junk, as per a report in&nbsp;<em>New York Post</em>. But it later turned out that she had been winning her drawing entries for the Second Chance online lottery games.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I didn't know that by playing certain games online I was earning entries into a second chance drawing, so I was confused when I came across an email from the Michigan Lottery in my spam folder saying I'd won a $207,199 BIG CA$H Second Chance jackpot prize," the woman from Macomb County in Michigan was quoted as saying by <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/07/30/us-news/michigan-woman-learns-of-207199-lottery-prize-from-email-in-spam-folder/">the <em>Post</em></a>.</p>

<p>She found out about the prize through little bit of research.</p>

<p>"After looking into it, I figured out how I had earned the entries, and then I checked three different times to make sure the email was real," said the woman.</p>

<p>The windfall will allow her to pay some bills and make investments.</p>

<p>Since the BIG CA$H Second Chance games launched in 2022, players have won more than $8 million in progressive prizes, according to lottery organisers.</p>

<h3><strong>Other big lottery wins</strong></h3>

<p>A mystery person in the US state of New Jersey won a whopping $1.13 billion Mega Millions jackpot in March this year. It was the fifth-largest prize ever won by Mega Millions players and the first time in 2024 that a ticket matched all the numbers needed to get the grand prize. The estimated jackpot was also the eighth largest in US lottery history.</p>

<p>In April, Cheng Saephan, a 46-year-old immigrant from Laos battling cancer, defied the odds by winning a staggering $1.3 billion on the Powerball lottery. Officials confirmed Mr Saephan purchased the winning ticket for the April 7th draw in Portland, Oregon.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Mohammed Deif, the head of Hamas' military wing, was killed in an airstrike in Gaza last month, the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) have confirmed. Deif was believed to be a key architect of the October 7 attack, which killed 1,195 people in Israel.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<ul>
	<li>Mohammed Deif was born in 1965 in the Khan Yunis Refugee Camp in the Gaza Strip. His family originated from al-Qubeiba, near Ramleh in Mandatory Palestine, and were displaced during the 1948 Palestine war. He graduated with a bachelor's degree in chemistry from the Islamic University of Gaza in 1988. Deif held an interest in the arts and established a theatre group called “The Returners” during his University years.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Deif joined Hamas in 1987, shortly after its founding during the First Intifada against Israeli occupation. Israeli authorities arrested him in 1989, but he was released in 1991 as part of a prisoner exchange after serving 16 months. He helped establish the Ezzedeen Al-Qassam Brigades, the armed wing of Hamas. In 2002, he took command of the Brigades after the assassination of Salah Shehade. Deif transformed the Brigades into organised military units, leading them to become a more effective force.</li>
	<li>Mohammed Deif orchestrated several devastating suicide bombings during the 1990s and early 2000s, including the 1996 Jaffa Road bus bombings. He also masterminded the kidnappings and killings of several Israeli soldiers. He developed and implemented Hamas' strategy of combining rocket attacks on Israel with tunnel warfare.</li>
	<li>He evaded seven Israeli assassination attempts since 2001, earning him the nickname “the cat with nine lives”. Israeli forces targeted him in airstrikes on his car, houses he visited and family homes. However, his survival has come at a high personal cost. In 2014, Israeli airstrikes killed his wife, infant son and 3-year-old daughter. Deif himself had suffered severe injuries, including the loss of an eye and limbs, as a result of these attempts on his life.</li>
	<li>Israel has pursued Mohammed Deif since 1995 for his role in killing soldiers and civilians, placing him on their 'most wanted' list. The US and European Union designated Deif as a terrorist, adding him to their terrorism lists in 2015 and 2023, respectively. Deif masterminded and carried out the 2023 October 7 Hamas-led attack on Israel. He claimed the attack was a response to Israeli actions at the Al-Aqsa mosque and the killing of Palestinians. In May 2024, the International Criminal Court's Prosecutor sought arrest warrants for Deif and other leaders for their actions during the attack.</li>

       <description><![CDATA[OpenAI is projected to earn between $3 billion to $4.5 billion in 2024, leaving behind a deficit of $5 billion in losses: The Information]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>OpenAI is set to burn all of its cash at current expenditures in 12 months' time, according to a report by The Information. The San Francisco based AI startup leader is on track to lose $5 billion, mainly due to high capital expenditure on cloud infrastructure required for training and running AI programs, including that for ChatGPT.</p>

<p>OpenAI has long relied on Microsoft for providing computing infrastructure for running its AI programs. Microsoft was also one of the earliest investors, with a $1 billion investment, three years before the launch of ChatGPT.</p>

<p>The $80 billion market valued company OpenAI has around 350,000 Nvidia A100 chips for running its programs (for inference alone), with 290,000 of those specifically for running ChatGPT, a source told The Information. These servers containing A100s are rented to OpenAI at $1.3 per hour by Microsoft, resulting in $4 Billion of estimated expenditure on these servers in 2024 alone.</p>

<p>For training alone, the company plans to spend $3 billion in 2024 and another $1.5 billion on salaries for its 1500 strong employees.</p>

<p>OpenAI generates a revenue of about $2 billion through ChatGPT and about $1 billion through providing access to its large language model. According to its recent monthly revenue report, OpenAI is projected to earn between $3 billion to $4.5 billion in 2024, leaving behind a deficit of $5 billion in losses. The company needs to raise fresh funds to keep the pace of its development with OpenAI setting its eyes on developing Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>OpenAI, responding to questions from US lawmakers, said it's dedicated to making sure its powerful AI tools don't cause harm, and that employees have ways to raise concerns about safety practices.</p>

<p>The startup sought to reassure lawmakers of its commitment to safety after five senators including Senator Brian Schatz, a Democrat from Hawaii, raised questions about OpenAI's policies in a letter addressed to Chief Executive Officer Sam Altman.</p>

<p>"Our mission is to ensure artificial intelligence benefits all of humanity, and we are dedicated to implementing rigorous safety protocols at every stage of our process," Chief Strategy Officer Jason Kwon said Wednesday in a letter to the lawmakers.</p>

<p>Specifically, OpenAI said it will continue to uphold its promise to allocate 20% of its computing resources toward safety-related research over multiple years.</p>

<p>The company, in its letter, also pledged that it won't enforce non-disparagement agreements for current and former employees, except in specific cases of a mutual non-disparagement agreement. OpenAI's former limits on employees who left the company have come under scrutiny for being unusually restrictive. OpenAI has since said it has changed its policies.</p>

<p>Altman later elaborated on its strategy on social media.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">a few quick updates about safety at openai:<br />
<br />
as we said last july, we're committed to allocating at least 20% of the computing resources to safety efforts across the entire company.<br />

— Sam Altman (@sama) <a href="https://twitter.com/sama/status/1818867964369928387?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 1, 2024</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>"Our team has been working with the US AI Safety Institute on an agreement where we would provide early access to our next foundation model so that we can work together to push forward the science of AI evaluations," he wrote on X.</p>

<p>Kwon, in his letter, also cited the recent creation of a safety and security committee, which is currently undergoing a review of OpenAI's processes and policies.</p>

<p>In recent months, OpenAI has faced a series of controversies around its commitment to safety and ability for employees to speak out on the topic. Several key members of its safety-related teams, including former co-founder and chief scientist Ilya Sutskever, resigned, along with another leader of the company's team devoted to assessing long-term safety risks, Jan Leike, who publicly shared concerns that the company was prioritizing product development over safety.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Thursday urged "all parties" in the Middle East to stop "escalatory actions" and achieve a ceasefire in Gaza, after Hamas's political leader was killed in a strike in Tehran that Iran blamed on Israel.</p>

<p>The strike that killed Ismail Haniyeh came just hours after Israel said it had killed a top Hezbollah commander in a retaliatory strike on the Lebanese capital Beirut.</p>

<p>The killings took place as regional tensions were already inflamed by the war in Gaza, a conflict that has drawn in Iran-backed operatives groups in Syria, Lebanon, Iraq and Yemen.</p>

<p>Israel has declined to comment on the Tehran strike.</p>

<p>Speaking in the Mongolian capital, top US diplomat Blinken warned the Middle East was on a path "toward more conflict, more violence, more suffering, more insecurity, and it is crucial that we break this cycle".</p>

<p>"That starts with a ceasefire that we've been working on," Blinken told reporters alongside his local counterpart.</p>

<p>"And to get there, it also first requires all parties to talk, to stop taking any escalatory actions, it requires them to find reasons to come to an agreement," he said.</p>

<p>As he did on Wednesday in Singapore, Blinken did not comment directly on the death of the leader of the Palestinian Islamist movement.</p>

<p>He also declined to speculate on the impact that Haniyeh's killing could have on a potential ceasefire in Gaza, which the United States has been spearheading along with Egypt and Qatar.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The tech giant said it was a DDoS attack that floods a service with traffic in order to bring them to a standstill.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Less than two weeks after global outage, dubbed as "blue screen of death", Microsoft suffered another similar incident, which the company said was triggered by a distributed denial of service (DDoS) cyberattack. <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kateoflahertyuk/2024/07/31/microsoft-confirms-new-outage-was-triggered-by-cyberattack/">According to <em>Forbes</em></a>, the latest attack was reported by several users on Tuesday in which users complained of not being able to access several Microsoft services, such as Office, Outlook and Azure. The incident lasted nearly 10 hours. Companies affected by the new outage include UK bank NatWest, as per the <em>BBC</em>.</p>

<p>Other impacted services included Azure App Services, Application Insights, Azure IoT Central, Azure Log Search Alerts, Azure Policy, as well as the Azure portal itself and "a subset of Microsoft 365 and Microsoft Purview services".</p>

<p>The tech giant said it was a DDoS attack that floods a service with traffic in order to bring them to a standstill.</p>

<p>Firms usually put protection in place for DDoS attacks, but an error in the implementation of defences "amplified the impact of the attack rather than mitigating it", said Microsoft.</p>

<p>This is the second major attack in nearly as many weeks. A Microsoft error had crippled Windows computers worldwide on July 19. It was later revealed that an update to the anti-virus program 'Falcon Sensor' by CrowdStrike caused the massive outage.</p>

<p>From airlines to news channels, the glitch led to the crashing of IT systems, disrupting the daily proceedings.</p>

<p>CrowdStrike's products are predominantly used by major organisations needing robust cyber attack protection, which is why the attack caused a global outage.</p>

<p>Reacting to the glitch, Crowdstrike CEO George Kurtz said it was not a security incident or cyberattack. The company identified the issue, isolated it and deployed a fix.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The Israeli military on Thursday announced that Hamas military chief Mohammed Deif had been killed in a strike it carried out last month in Gaza's southern area of Khan Yunis.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel's army confirmed on Thursday that Hamas military chief Mohammed Deif was killed in an air strike last month in the southern Gaza Strip.</p>

<p>The announcement came a day after Hamas and Iran said the Palestinian movement's chief Ismail Haniyeh was killed in Tehran. Israel has not commented on that report.</p>

<p>"Mohammed Deif, the Osama bin Laden of Gaza was eliminated" on July 13, Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">We can now confirm: Mohammed Deif was eliminated.</p>
— Israel Defense Forces (@IDF) <a href="https://twitter.com/IDF/status/1818926099432161437?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 1, 2024</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>This is a "significant milestone in the process of dismantling Hamas" in Gaza, Gallant added.</p>

<p>The army said fighter jets had struck Khan Yunis on July 13 and "following an intelligence assessment, it can be confirmed that Mohammed Deif was eliminated in the strike".</p>

<p>He was killed along with one of his top commanders, Rafa Salama, the military said.</p>

<p>Health authorities in Hamas-run Gaza said more than 90 people had been killed in that strike but Hamas has denied Deif was among them.</p>

<p>"Deif initiated, planned, and executed the October 7th massacre," the military said.</p>

<p>On that day the Hamas group attacked southern Israel, resulting in the death of 1,197 people, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.</p>

<p>Deif became head of Hamas's armed wing, Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades, in 2002.</p>

<p>He was among Israel's most wanted man for nearly three decades and on a US list of "international terrorists" since 2015.</p>

<p>"During the war, he commanded Hamas's terrorist activity in the Gaza Strip by issuing commands and instructions to senior members of Hamas's military wing," the military said.</p>

<p>Deif, whose real name is Mohammed Diab al-Masri, was born in the Khan Yunis refugee camp in 1965.</p>

<p>The word Deif means "visitor" or "guest" and some say he chose it because he was always on the move with Israeli hunters on his trail, never spending more than one night in the same place.</p>

<p><strong>'Cat with nine lives'</strong></p>

<p>In videos, Deif has appeared masked or shown in a silhouette, while rare photographs have circulated of one of Israel's most wanted men.</p>

<p>In January, Israel released a picture of Deif showing him with one eye missing, without specifying when it was taken.</p>

<p>His enemies dubbed him the "cat with nine lives" because of his many close calls with death.</p>

<p>In 2014, Israel launched an air strike on Gaza, killing Deif's wife and a seven-month-old son.</p>

<p>It was Deif who announced the start of the Hamas attack -- operation "Al-Aqsa Flood" -- in an audio message on October 7.</p>

<p>Deif became involved in Hamas in the 1980s when he was a student at the Gaza Islamic University.</p>

<p>He is said to have played a key role in the huge network of tunnels built beneath Gaza.</p>

<p>He was detained by Israel since the 1980s and spent about two years in a prison run by the Palestinian Authority. He was released or escaped, reports said.</p>

<p>In May, the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court requested a warrant for his arrest -- alongside with Yahya Sinwar, the chief of Hamas in Gaza who is still being hunted by Israel -- for war crimes and crimes against humanity.</p>

<p>Hamas political leader Haniyeh, who was killed Wednesday in the Iranian capital, was also on that list.</p>

<p>The prosecutor has also sought warrants for Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and defence minister Gallant.</p>

<p>During the October 7 attack, Hamas operatives also seized 251 people, 111 are still captive in Gaza, including 39 the military says are dead.</p>

<p>Israel's military campaign since then has killed 39,480 people in Gaza, according to the health ministry in the territory, which does not provide details of civilian and militant deaths.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy has accused Vice President Kamala Harris of leaning into 'identity politics' and claimed that she only considered herself Indian-American when "convenient."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ramaswamy, who supports for president and the Republican Party's nominee Donald Trump now, said that Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, leaned on her Indian American heritage while running for office in California, where there is a significant Asian American population, but has since shifted her focus away from that identity on the national stage.</p>

<p>The 38-year-old Indian-American biotech entrepreneur drew a comparison between Harris' heritage and his own to share his views on the subject. "On a very personal level, my parents were immigrants to this country, legal immigrants from southern India- the very same part of India that (Harris') mother also immigrated from," he told Fox News.</p>

<p>"I think it's a hard fact... it's a fact whether you like it or not, that many Indian-Americans in the US are indeed somewhat offended by the way Kamala has suddenly cast aside the Indian-American side of identity," Ramaswamy said.</p>

<p>She leaned into it when she ran for Office in California- big Asian-American and Indian-American population, he said. "So she wore that when it was convenient. She's wearing a different identity now when it is politically convenient on a national stage," he alleged.</p>

<p>He said he does not think Americans should be relying on these ethnic identities at all. "We're actually American. And the problem is, when you're Kamala Harris and you actually lean into your identity politics, then you open the door to that type of criticism," he said.</p>

<p>"But if you ask me, that shouldn't be how this election is decided one way or another. It should be decided on our own identity as Americans and what our vision is for the future of our country. And the number one thing missing in Kamala Harris' candidacy is that she lacks that vision for the country," he added.</p>

<p>Harris, 59, is Indian American and African American. Her mother emigrated from India, and her father emigrated from Jamaica.</p>

<p>Former President Trump, Harris' Republican rival, also mocked Vice President Harris's heritage during a combative live interview Wednesday at the National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ) convention, saying "she happened to turn Black" in recent years.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<h2><strong>What is 'dark tourism'?</strong></h2>

<p>Dark tourism, a phenomenon gaining significant attention in recent years, has been thrust into the global spotlight by TV shows like Chernobyl and The Dark Tourist. But what is it?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dark tourism refers to the practice of travelling to and visiting sites associated with death, suffering, tragedy, violence, or the unusual. These destinations can include cemeteries, mausoleums, mortuaries, disaster zones, battlefields, memorials, prisons, execution sites, and crime scenes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dark tourism destinations may include the Chernobyl exclusion zone in Ukraine, the Killing Fields in Cambodia, the Auschwitz camp in Poland, and the 9/11 Memorial in the US.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Other sites might be haunted houses, paranormal activity, or infamous historical events.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Definitions of 'dark tourism'</strong></h2>

<p>One of the earliest definitions of dark tourism was provided by <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0826450644/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=lifeasabutter-21&amp;creative=6738&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=0826450644&amp;linkId=ea7f09c74fbeea0c9125d950ed1088ff ">John Lennon and Malcolm Foley</a>, who described it as "the representation of inhuman acts, and how these are interpreted for visitors."</p>

<p>A more recent definition by <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/9781405165518.wbeosd045.pub2">Kevin Fox Gotham</a> expands on this idea, describing dark tourism as "the circulation of people to places characterised by distress, atrocity or sadness and pain."</p>

<p>Mr Gotham also introduced the concept of "disaster tourism", which refers to situations where tourism rises in response to a major disaster or traumatic event.</p>

<h2><strong>Why dark tourism is popular</strong></h2>

<p>For many, the appeal of dark tourism lies in the emotional connection they make with a place of tragedy. Visitors seek to immerse themselves in the history and culture of a location and connect with the emotions of those who experienced the tragedy firsthand.</p>

<p>By visiting these sites, people can tangibly engage with the past, paying respects to those who suffered. Dark tourism allows individuals to process and understand the significance of historical events and reflect on history.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iran held funeral processions on Thursday with calls for revenge after the killing in Tehran of Hamas political chief Ismail Haniyeh in a strike blamed on Israel.</p>

<p>The Islamic republic's supreme leader <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/iran-leader-to-lead-funeral-prayers-for-hamas-chief-ismail-haniyeh-6236223" target="_blank">Ayatollah Ali Khamenei</a> led prayers for Haniyeh ahead of his burial in Qatar, having earlier threatened a "harsh punishment" for his killing.</p>

<p>In Tehran's city centre, thousands of mourning crowds carrying posters of Haniyeh and Palestinian flags gathered for the ceremony at Tehran University before a procession, according to an AFP correspondent.</p>

<p>Haniyeh's death was announced the day before by Iran's Revolutionary Guards, who said he and his bodyguard were killed in a strike on their accommodation in the Iranian capital at 2:00 am (2230 GMT) on Wednesday.</p>

<p>It came just hours after Israel targeted and killed top Hezbollah commander Fuad Shukr in a retaliatory strike on the Lebanese capital Beirut, sending fears of a wider regional war soaring in fallout from the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.</p>

<p>Israel has declined to comment on the Tehran strike.</p>

<p>Iran's state TV showed the coffins of Haniyeh and his bodyguards covered in Palestinian flags during the ceremony attended by senior Iranian officials.</p>

<p>President Masoud Pezeshkian and Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps chief, General Hossein Salami, were present. Haniyeh had been visiting Tehran for Pezeshkian's inauguration ceremony on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Senior Hamas figure Khalil al-Hayya, the movement's foreign relations chief, vowed during the funeral ceremony that "Ismail Haniyeh's slogan, 'We will not recognise Israel,' will remain an immortal slogan" and "we will pursue Israel until it is uprooted from the land of Palestine."</p>

<p>Iran's conservative parliamentary speaker Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf said Iran "will certainly carry out the supreme leader's order (to avenge Haniyeh.)"</p>

<p>"It is our duty to respond at the right time and in the right place," he said in a speech with crowds chanting "Death to Israel, Death to America!"</p>

<h3><strong>Our duty</strong></h3>

<p>The caskets, with a black-and-white pattern resembling a Palestinian keffiyeh scarf, were borne on a flower-bedecked truck through leafy streets where cooling water mists sprayed the flag-waving crowds.</p>

<p>Khamenei, who has the final say in Iran's political affairs, said after Haniyeh's death that it was "our duty to seek revenge for his blood as he was martyred in the territory of the Islamic Republic of Iran".</p>

<p>The Islamic republic has not yet officially published any information on the exact location of the strike.</p>

<p>Pezeshkian said Wednesday that "the Zionists (Israel) will soon see the consequences of their cowardly and terrorist act".</p>

<p>The international community, however, called for de-escalation and a focus on securing a ceasefire in Gaza -- which Haniyeh had, according to a Hamas official previously, accused Israel of obstructing.</p>

<p>UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the strikes in Tehran and Beirut represented a "dangerous escalation".</p>

<p>All efforts, he said, should be "leading to a ceasefire" in Gaza and the release of hostages taken during Hamas's October 7 attack on southern Israel which began nearly 10 months of war.</p>

<p>The prime minister of key ceasefire broker Qatar said Haniyeh's killing had thrown the whole mediation process into doubt.</p>

<p>"How can mediation succeed when one party assassinates the negotiator on the other side?" Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani said in a post on social media site X.</p>

<p>US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Thursday called on "all parties" in the Middle East to "stop escalatory actions."</p>

<p>Earlier he said a ceasefire in Gaza was still the "imperative", though White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said the twin killings of Haniyeh and Shukr "don't help" regional tensions.</p>

<h3><strong>Tensions inflamed</strong></h3>

<p>While Iran has blamed the attack on its arch-foe, Israel has declined to comment on Haniyeh's death. It did, however, claim the killing of Shukr, whom it blamed for a weekend rocket strike that killed 12 youths in the Israeli-annexed Golan Heights.</p>

<p>The killings come with regional tensions already inflamed by the war in Gaza, a conflict that has drawn in Iran-backed operatives groups in Syria, Lebanon, Iraq and Yemen.</p>

<p>One of those groups, Yemen's Huthi rebels, "declared three days of mourning" for Haniyeh, with political leader Mahdi al-Mashat expressing "condolences to the Palestinian people and Hamas" over his killing, according to the group's Saba news agency.</p>

<p>The United Nations Security Council also convened an emergency meeting Wednesday at Iran's request to discuss the strike.</p>

<p>Hamas has for months been indirectly negotiating a truce and hostage-prisoner exchange deal with Israel, in talks facilitated by Egypt, Qatar and the United States.</p>

<p>Analysts told AFP that Haniyeh was a moderating influence within the Islamist group, and that while he would be replaced, the dynamics within Hamas could change.</p>

<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to destroy Hamas in retaliation for the October 7 attack that ignited war in Gaza.</p>

<p>That attack resulted in the deaths of 1,197 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.</p>

<p>Operatives also seized 251 hostages, 111 of whom are still held captive in Gaza, including 39 the military says are dead.</p>

<p>Concern grew among Israelis over the fate of those still held in Gaza.</p>

<p>Haniyeh's killing "was a mistake as it threatens the possibility of having a hostage deal," said Anat Noy, a resident of the coastal city of Haifa.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory campaign against Hamas has killed at least 39,445 people in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>British Prime Minister Keir Starmer will meet senior police leaders on Thursday, his office said, between after a second night of clashes between protesters and police prompted by the deaths of three young girls in a frenzied knife attack at a dance class.</p>

<p>There were angry scenes in London on Wednesday evening as thousands of anti-immigration protesters gathered near Starmer's Downing Street office and residence chanting "save our kids" and "we want our country back".</p>

<p>The previous night more than 50 police officers were injured in violent clashes in the English seaside town of Southport, where Monday's stabbings took place.</p>

<p>A 17-year-old male was in police custody on suspicion of murder and attempted murder after the bloody rampage on Monday at a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/completely-in-shock-taylor-swift-on-uk-mass-stabbings-that-killed-3-girls-6224379" target="_blank">"Taylor Swift</a> yoga and dance workshop", a summer vacation event for children aged 6 to 11.</p>

<p>Starmer's office said he would use Thursday's meeting with police to "offer them the government's full backing following multiple high-profile incidents of extreme violence and public disorder on our streets".</p>

<p>"While the right to peaceful protest must be protected at all costs, he will be clear that criminals who exploit that right in order to sow hatred and carry out violent acts will face the full force of the law," his office added.</p>

<p>The disorder took place after false information was spread on social media that the suspect was a radical Islamist migrant.</p>

<p>Police are legally restricted in the details they can provide about the alleged teenage attacker, but they have said the incident was not terrorism-related and that he was born in Britain, quashing speculation on his origins.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Less than two weeks after Joe Biden ended his re election bid, his 52-year-old vice president is in full control of the party, having emerged as the only Democrat in the running to challenge Republican Donald Trump in November.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kamala Harris will be confirmed as the Democratic US presidential nominee in an electronic vote starting Thursday that replaces the fanfare of in-person balloting that usually kicks off the party's national convention.</p>

<p>Less than two weeks after <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/video/joe-biden-explains-why-he-ended-re-election-bid-818521" target="_blank">Joe Biden ended his re election bid</a>, his 52-year-old vice president is in full control of the party, having emerged as the only Democrat in the running to challenge Republican Donald Trump in November.</p>

<p>Just under 4,000 delegates, the grassroots activists and politicians allocated during the primary process, sent in signatures backing Harris to be on the ballot for the five-day electronic vote.</p>

<p>No other Democrats have stepped forward to challenge her elevation to the top of the ticket, making her confirmation as the first Black and South Asian woman ever to secure a major party's nomination a formality.</p>

<p>She won the support of 99 percent of the delegates who signed petitions, the Democratic National Committee (DNC) said in a statement, while no one else met the qualifying threshold of 300 signatures.</p>

<p>"Our delegates have an important responsibility -- and opportunity -- in the days ahead to cast their history-making ballots for Vice President Harris, ensuring that she will be on the ballot in every state this November," said DNC chair Jaime Harrison.</p>

<p>"Our party has met this unprecedented moment with a transparent, democratic and orderly process to unite behind a nominee with a proven record who will lead us in the fight ahead."</p>

<p>As well as the "pledged" delegates there are around 700 so-called "superdelegates" who get to vote because they hold elected office -- such as state governors or members of the US Congress -- or are party officials.</p>

<p>The roll call launches at 9:00 am (1300 GMT) Thursday and delegates have until 6:00 pm (2000 GMT) on Monday to return their votes via an online platform run by the DNC.</p>

<p>The announcement could come late Monday, as she hits the campaign trail for a swing across seven crucial battleground states with her newly minted running mate, who has not yet been announced.</p>

<p>US media reported that she would kick off the tour in Pennsylvania on Tuesday, although the DNC did not immediately respond to a request for confirmation.</p>

<p>The 2024 nominating system is largely as it was in 2020, when the Covid-19 pandemic prevented a large in-person convention, but it is still unusual.</p>

<p>The DNC swapped to a virtual process because of Ohio's deadline -- Wednesday next week -- for major parties to submit the names of their certified candidates for the November election.</p>

<p>Much remains unclear about the announcement of the results, however.</p>

<p>The DNC has not revealed if the vote will be livestreamed or if a rolling tally will be available to the public, and has not disclosed whether it would make the results public before the end of the voting period if they were available.</p>

<p>The virtual roll-call marks the official beginning of the 2024 convention, although in practice the festivities get going when thousands of the party's grassroots activists descend on Chicago on August 19.</p>

<p>There will be ceremonial votes for Harris and her running mate in Illinois, in what is expected to be a raucous celebration of her rise from state politics to the top of the ticket.</p>

<p>"Think about this: her dad is of Jamaican descent, her mother's of South Asian descent and then she went to the great Howard University, worked in California, worked in the United States Senate," Georgia Senator Raphael Warnock told a raucous, 10,000-strong crowd at Harris's rally in Atlanta on Tuesday.</p>

<p>"That is the American story. She brings all of those strands together. She sees us because in a real sense she is all of us."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

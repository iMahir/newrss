       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;The United Nations has reported that one of its humanitarian vehicles in Gaza, marked with the organisation's insignia, was fired upon 10 times by Israeli forces, including shots targeting its front windows, while it was part of a convoy fully coordinated with the Israeli army.</p>

<p>UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric stated on Wednesday that the two staff members in the vehicle were unharmed. He referred to comments made by a senior UN official, who requested anonymity, two days ago to journalists about the need for armoured vehicles in Gaza.</p>

<p>The incident underscored the importance of this, as the armoured vehicle saved the lives of the staff members and revealed that current coordination mechanisms are ineffective.</p>

<p>Dujarric assured that the UN would continue to work with the Israeli army to ensure that such incidents do not recur.</p>

<p>The international spokesperson stressed the necessity for all parties to respect international humanitarian law at all times, which includes the protection of civilians and the provision of their basic needs, such as food, water, shelter, and health care, wherever they are in Gaza.</p>

<p>He clarified that this applies to those under evacuation orders, whether they have moved or not, indicating that those who leave must be given sufficient time to depart, safe routes, and safe areas to which they can go.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The chief of Telegram Pavel Durov on Wednesday was charged by the French judiciary with a litany of violations related to the messaging app but allowed to go free while being banned from leaving the country.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>France on Wednesday charged Pavel Durov, the founder and chief of Telegram, with a litany of violations related to the messaging app and banned him from leaving the country while allowing the billionaire to walk free after four days under arrest.</p>

<p>Durov, 39, was charged on several counts of failing to curb extremist and illegal content on the popular messaging app following a hearing with investigating magistrates in Paris.</p>

<p>Russian-born Durov was arrested at Le Bourget airport outside Paris late Saturday and questioned in subsequent days under arrest by investigators.</p>

<p>He was granted conditional release against a bail of five million euros and on the condition he must report to a police station twice a week as well as remaining in France, Paris prosecutor Laure Beccuau said in a statement.</p>

<p>The charges concern alleged crimes involving an organised group including "complicity in the administration of an online platform to enable an illicit transaction".</p>

<p>Durov has also been charged with refusing to share documents demanded by authorities as well as "dissemination in an organised group of images of minors in child pornography" as well as drug trafficking, fraud and money laundering.</p>

<p>His lawyer David-Olivier Kaminski said it was "absurd" to suggest Durov could be implicated in any crime committed on the app, adding: "Telegram complies in all respects with European rules concerning digital technology."</p>

<p>Separately, Durov is also being investigated on suspicion of "serious acts of violence" towards one of his children while he and an ex-partner, the boy's mother, were in Paris, a source said. She also filed another complaint against Durov in Switzerland last year.</p>

<p><strong>- 'Not political' -</strong></p>

<p>The tech mogul founded Telegram as he was in the process of quitting his native Russia a decade ago. Its growth has been exponential, with the app now reporting more than 900 million users.</p>

<p>An enigmatic figure who rarely speaks in public, Durov is a citizen of Russia, France and the United Arab Emirates, where Telegram is based.</p>

<p>Forbes magazine estimates his current fortune at $15.5 billion, though he proudly promotes the virtues of an ascetic life that includes ice baths and not drinking alcohol or coffee.</p>

<p>Numerous questions have been raised about the timing and circumstances of Durov's detention, with supporters seeing him as a freedom of speech champion and detractors as a menace who wilfully allowed Telegram to get out of control.</p>

<p>Le Monde newspaper reported Wednesday that Durov had met President Emmanuel Macron on several occasions prior to receiving French nationality in 2021, via a special procedure reserved for those deemed to have made a special contribution to France.</p>

<p>The Wall Street Journal added that at one lunch in 2018, Macron -- who along with his team was in the past an avid user of Telegram -- had suggested it should be headquartered in Paris, but Durov refused.</p>

<p>According to a source close to the case, confirming a story first published on the Politico news site, both Pavel Durov and his elder brother Nikolai, a lower-profile figure seen as the mathematical brain behind Telegram, have been wanted by France since March this year.</p>

<p>In a post on X to address what he called "false information" concerning the case, Macron said Durov's arrest was "in no way a political decision" and it was "up to the judges to rule".</p>

<p>In Moscow, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the charges were very serious and thus needed "no less serious evidence".</p>

<p>Among those voicing support for Durov is fellow tech tycoon and chief executive of X, Elon Musk, who has posted comments under the hashtag #FreePavel.</p>

<p><strong>- 'Near total absence' -</strong></p>

<p>Durov left Russia a decade ago as he was setting up Telegram amid an ownership squabble concerning his first project, the Russian social network VKontakte.</p>

<p>But his departure from Russia was reportedly not an abrupt exile: according to the Vazhnye Istorii news site, citing leaked border data, he visited the country more than 50 times between 2015 and 2021.</p>

<p>Telegram has positioned itself as a "neutral" alternative to US-owned platforms, which have been criticised for their commercial exploitation of users' personal data.</p>

<p>It has also played a key role since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, used actively by politicians and commentators on both sides of the war.</p>

<p>The Paris prosecutor said the French judicial authorities had been made aware of the "near total absence of a response" from Telegram to requests from the authorities and had first opened an investigation in February 2024.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The gunman who tried to kill Donald Trump mounted a "sustained, detailed effort" to attack a major gathering of some sort before deciding to target the Republican presidential candidate at a Pennsylvania rally in July, FBI officials said on Wednesday.</p>

<p>FBI officials said Thomas Crooks, 20, searched more than 60 times for information about the Republican presidential candidate and his then-rival, Democratic President Joe Biden, before registering for the Trump rally in early July.</p>

<p>"We saw ... a sustained, detailed effort to plan an attack on some events, meaning he looked at any number of events or targets," Kevin Rojek, the FBI's top official in western Pennsylvania, said in a telephone briefing to reporters.</p>

<p>Rojek said Crooks became "hyper focused" on the Trump rally when it was announced in early July "and looked at it as a target of opportunity."</p>

<p>Rojek said the FBI has not yet been able to determine what motivated Crooks to try to assassinate Trump at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, on July 13.</p>

<p>Crooks' computer activity showed he was interested in a mix of ideologies, but did not show definitively that he was motivated by a particular left-leaning or right-leaning point of view, Rojek said.</p>

<p>FBI officials said they had not found any evidence indicated that Crooks had worked with other people, or had been directed by a foreign power.</p>

<p>There were no traces of illicit drugs or alcohol in his system.</p>

<p>The assassination attempt prompted questions about how Crooks was able to climb a nearby building and fire eight shots at the former president before being killed by a Secret Service sharpshooter. Several congressional and government probes are examining the event's security measures.</p>

<p>The FBI, meanwhile, is investigating Crooks himself. Officials said they had gained some understanding of his mindset, even if they still did not know what motivated him.</p>

<p>Crooks searched for Trump's campaign events as early as September 2023, FBI officials said, and began searching in April for campaign events for both candidates near where he lived in western Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>He also searched for the dates of both the Republican and Democratic presidential conventions, they said.</p>

<p>In the days leading up to the July 13 rally, he searched for information about the site, including where Trump would speak and details of the company that owned a nearby building where he would later fire the eight shots, one of which grazed Trump's ear. Video evidence shows Crooks was only on the building's roof for about six minutes.</p>

<p>Crooks, who left several explosive devices in his car, had searched for information about bomb components as early as 2019.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Israeli military said on Wednesday it had "failed" in its response to a settler attack in the occupied West Bank earlier this month that Palestinian officials said killed one man.</p>

<p>The August 15 raid on the northern West Bank village of Jit came amid soaring violence in the Palestinian territory during the Gaza war and growing international concern over an uptick in attacks by Jewish settlers.</p>

<p>Major General Avi Bluth, head of the military's Central Command which operates in the West Bank, was quoted in a statement as saying the attack was "a very serious terror incident in which Israelis set out to deliberately harm the residents of the town of Jit, and we failed by not succeeding to arrive earlier to protect them".</p>

<p>Jit residents have said about 100 settlers armed with knives and firearms set fire to cars and homes in the village.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The military, releasing on Wednesday a summary of its investigation, said the group wore masks, threw rocks and Molotov cocktails and set three vehicles and two buildings on fire.</p>

<p>The Palestinian health ministry said a 23-year-old Palestinian man, Rashid Sada, was shot dead in the attack.</p>

<p>Last week, Israeli police and the Shin Bet internal security service said they had arrested four suspects for "terrorist" acts in connection with the incident.</p>

<p>The military's investigation found that the first troops at the scene "did not manage to fully gauge the situation" and "needed to act more decisively", the statement said.</p>

<p>"Several members of the rapid response team from a nearby (settlement) community, who were not in active reserve duty, arrived at the scene without authorisation, dressed in uniform, and acted contrary to the authority defined for the members of the rapid response team," it added without elaborating.</p>

<p>Two members of the team "were dismissed, and their weapons were confiscated", it said.</p>

<p>The statement said the shooting that killed Sada and wounded another Palestinian occurred before more Israeli forces managed to disperse the assailants.</p>

<p>"The troops acted assertively, risking their lives, containing the rioters, and pushing them out of the town using crowd dispersal means and firing into the air," the statement said.</p>

<p>"Half an hour after the incident began, all Israelis were removed from the town."</p>

<p>Bluth was quoted as saying the case "will not be closed until we bring the perpetrators to justice".</p>

<h3><strong>Rising violence</strong></h3>

<p>Israeli President Isaac Herzog "firmly" condemned the attack on Jit when it occurred.</p>

<p>Since Hamas's unprecedented October 7 attack on Israel triggered war in Gaza, violence has flared in the West Bank, a Palestinian territory occupied by Israel since 1967 and separated geographically from Gaza by Israeli territory.</p>

<p>Israeli settlements in the West Bank, where some 490,000 people live, are illegal under international law. The United Nations considers them an obstacle to Israeli-Palestinian peace.</p>

<p>On Wednesday Washington announced new sanctions on Israeli settlers in the West Bank over violence against Palestinians, urging Israel to bring greater accountability.</p>

<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said on Wednesday that he viewed the sanctions "with utmost severity" and that they were the subject of "pointed discussion" with the US.</p>

<p>Since October 7, at least 660 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank by Israeli troops or settlers, according to an AFP count based on Palestinian official figures.</p>

<p>During the same period, at least 19 Israelis, including soldiers, have been killed in Palestinian attacks, according to Israeli official figures.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Some 22,000 participants wearing white clothes bespattered with tomato pulp engaged in the frenzy that grips Bunol - located 40 km (25 miles) to the west of Valencia - every year in the last week of August.</p>

<p>Seven trucks distributed 150 tons of ripe pear tomatoes to eager roisterers, many of them visiting from abroad. Non-residents pay a fee of 15 euros ($16.70), while Bunol locals enjoy it for free.</p>

<p>"We love tomatoes! That's why we decided to come and we had a fab time," said Taylor, who came from Australia, adding that she and her friends would "make some spaghetti to have with the sauce".</p>

<p>The start of the hour-long fight was signalled by firecrackers ignited once one of the contenders managed to climb up a slippery pole lathered in soap to snatch a leg of ham hanging from the top.</p>

<p>Senam, from Kenya, described the event as "beautiful, wonderful, creative, mind-blowing".</p>

<p>After the friendly fight ended, a cleaning crew armed with water hoses was dispatched to remove the refuse from the town's streets, which were left gleaming thanks to the tomatoes' natural acidity.</p>

<p>The fruits, grown specifically for the festival, are considered too sour for human consumption.</p>

<p>According to the Tomatina's official website, the festival originated during a brawl that ensued in 1945 when youngsters attempting to get a closer view of a parade knocked over one of the participants. Several people plucked tomatoes from a nearby stand as makeshift projectiles until police restored order.</p>

<p>The following year, youths recreated the altercation, with some even bringing their own tomatoes. The event was briefly outlawed in the 1950s under General Francisco Franco's fascist dictatorship, but resumed in 1959 with certain rules.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Berkshire Hathaway Inc. became the first US company outside of the tech sector to surpass $1 trillion in market value.</p>

<p>Shares of Warren Buffett's conglomerate rose as much as 0.8% on Wednesday to push its market capitalization above the trillion-dollar mark for the first time. The stock has rallied this year on strong insurance results and economic optimism. The Omaha, Nebraska-based company joins the ranks of a small group to crack the milestone, dominated by technology giants like Alphabet Inc., Meta Platforms Inc. and Nvidia Corp. &nbsp;</p>

<p>"Berkshire has done it the slower, but more sure, way," said Steve Check, the founder and chief investment officer of Check Capital Management. His firm has about $2 billion in assets under management, with Berkshire as their largest holding. "It's harder to make money the old-fashioned way."</p>

<p>Berkshire's rally this year has outpaced the S&amp;P 500's gains, with the company off to one of its best annual starts in a decade. It's gained 30% in 2024, while the market benchmark is up 18%. The company isn't that far behind the so-called Magnificent Seven: a gauge of the biggest tech stocks is up 35% this year.</p>

<p>Buffett has spent the bulk of his life turning Berkshire Hathaway from a struggling textile maker into a sprawling business empire. He shaped the company alongside longtime business partner Charlie Munger, who died in November at age 99.</p>

<p>Berkshire's market value climbed by roughly 20% a year from 1965 through last year - nearly double the S&amp;P 500's annual return in that time. That's turned Buffett into one of the richest people in the world, and perhaps the most prolific investor ever.</p>

<p>The conglomerate's strength comes as optimism for the economy builds, with the Federal Reserve expected to cut interest rates at its September meeting. Consumer confidence rose to a six-month high in August. Berkshire's businesses span from truck stop operator Pilot Travel Centers LLC to ice cream chain Dairy Queen and battery brand Duracell.</p>

<p>The stock has added more than $200 billion in market capitalization this year alone - a record for the firm, but a sharp contrast to Nvidia's nearly $2 trillion increase. Berkshire's rally has pushed it into overbought territory, based on the relative strength index, and prompted a bit of reticence from analysts.</p>

<p>The fundamental outlook for Berkshire's core businesses isn't necessarily that much brighter ahead, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Matthew Palazola, but the firm boasts an "all-weather" portfolio.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, lower interest rates could impact returns on the record cash pile Berkshire amassed while slashing its Apple Inc. stake and paring its Bank of America Corp. holdings. Buffett's cash heap stood at about $276.9 billion in second-quarter results reported in early August. The sheer size of the Apple stake had become a worry, Check said, and the move to reduce that exposure was prudent. "It's taken a lot of that risk off the table," Check said.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel launched a large-scale military operation today in the West Bank, where the army said it killed nine Palestinian fighters, while the nearly 11-month Gaza war showed no signs of abating.</p>

<p>Violence has surged in the West Bank during the Gaza war sparked by Palestinian Islamist group Hamas's unprecedented October 7 attacks on Israel.</p>

<p>The war has killed more than 40,000 people in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry. It has also caused widespread destruction, displaced nearly all of Gaza's 2.4 million people at least once and triggered a humanitarian crisis.</p>

<p>In the West Bank in the early hours of Wednesday, the Israeli military launched a series of coordinated raids across four cities -- Jenin, Nablus, Tubas and Tulkarem.</p>

<p>Columns of Israeli armoured vehicles entered two refugee camps, in Tulkarem and Tubas, as well as Jenin.</p>

<p>By midday, they were blocking entrances to the towns and camps, AFP photographers said, with soldiers firing at the camps from which gunfire and explosions were heard.</p>

<p>Israeli bulldozers dug up asphalt from the streets, with the army saying it was looking for roadside bombs.</p>

<p>The Palestinian Red Crescent said Israeli forces killed nine people and wounded 15 others in the raids, revising its previous toll of 10 dead.</p>

<p>Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas cut short a visit to Saudi Arabia and headed home to "follow up on the latest developments in light of the Israeli aggression on the northern West Bank", Palestinian official media said.</p>

<p>The Israeli army said it had killed nine Palestinian "terrorists", with no casualties so far on its side.</p>

<p>Soldiers encountered explosives and were exchanging fire with militants, said army spokesman Nadav Shoshani. He declined to say how many were involved or how long the operation would last.</p>

<p>The operation, he added, was not "extremely different (from usual army activity in the area) or special".</p>

<p><strong>'This Is War'</strong></p>

<p>Foreign Minster Israel Katz had a different take, however, saying the military was "operating in full force since last night" in a bid to "dismantle Iranian-Islamic terror infrastructure".</p>

<p>In a post on X, he accused Iran, Israel's main foe in the region, of seeking to "establish an eastern front against Israel" based on the "model" for Gaza and Lebanon, where it backs Hamas and Hezbollah, respectively.</p>

<p>"We must address this threat with the same determination used against terror infrastructures in Gaza, including temporary evacuation of residents and any necessary measures," Katz said.</p>

<p>"This is a war, and we must win it."</p>

<p>Since Hamas's October 7 attack, Israeli troops or settlers have killed more than 650 Palestinians in the West Bank, according to an AFP tally based on Palestinian health ministry figures.</p>

<p>During the same period, at least 19 Israelis have been killed in Palestinian attacks, according to Israeli officials.</p>

<p>While Israeli military operations have become a daily occurrence in the West Bank, occupied by Israel since 1967, it is rare for these to happen in multiple cities simultaneously.</p>

<p>In recent weeks, Israel's West Bank operations have focused on the territory's north, where armed groups are particularly active.</p>

<p><strong>Patients Flee Hospital</strong></p>

<p>Last week, the army announced it had killed a senior Palestinian militant in Lebanon, accusing him of "directing attacks and smuggling weapons" to the West Bank and collaborating with Iranian forces.</p>

<p>Islamic Jihad, a Palestinian Islamist movement allied with Hamas which has a strong presence in the northern West Bank, issued a statement early Wednesday denouncing an "open war" by Israel.</p>

<p>"With this aggression, which aims to transfer the weight of the conflict to the occupied West Bank, the occupier wants to impose a new state of affairs on the ground to annex the West Bank," the statement said.</p>

<p>Hamas, whose popularity has soared in the West Bank since the Gaza war began, late Tuesday reiterated its call for Palestinians in the territory to "rise up".</p>

<p>Its statement came in response to comments by far-right Israeli National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir, who said this week he would build a synagogue at Jerusalem's flashpoint Al-Aqsa mosque compound if he could.</p>

<p>Ben Gvir, a settler himself, has openly called for the annexation of the West Bank.</p>

<p>In Gaza, families in distress continued to move according to the Israeli army's evacuation orders.</p>

<p>One of the latest targeted the area around Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Hospital in Deir el-Balah in central Gaza, from which "nearly 650 patients have fled", Doctors Without Borders (MSF) said.</p>

<p>The medical charity's website says it has "quickly opened a field hospital and started receiving patients amid a severe lack of supplies and resources".</p>

<p>MSF said field hospitals are not a solution, "but a last resort in response to Israel's dismantling of the healthcare system".</p>

<p>Gaza's civil defence agency reported at least 12 dead, including at least one child and a woman, in new Israeli strikes.</p>

<p>Hamas's October 7 attack resulted in the deaths of 1,199 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory military campaign has killed at least 40,534 people in Gaza, according to the territory's health ministry. The UN rights office says most of the dead are women and children.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>SpaceX postponed once more its attempt at launching a daring orbital expedition featuring an all-civilian crew that is aiming to carry out the first-ever spacewalk by private citizens.</p>

<p>The Polaris Dawn mission, organized by billionaire entrepreneur Jared Isaacman, had been set to lift off from NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida during a four-hour window early Wednesday.</p>

<p>But SpaceX announced late Tuesday it was pushing back the launch plans "due to unfavorable weather forecasted in Dragon's splashdown areas off the coast of Florida," in a message on X.</p>

<p>Isaacman later added on X that, because the spaceship won't rendezvous with the International Space Station and has limited consumables on board, it was particularly constrained by the forecast during the splashdown window.</p>

<p>"As of now, conditions are not favorable tonight or tomorrow, so we'll assess day by day," he said.</p>

<p>The timing of the next launch could be further complicated by the fact the first stage booster of another SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket that had sent a batch of Starlink satellites into orbit tipped over and exploded during a landing attempt on a waiting droneship.</p>

<p>Although landing the booster is a secondary consideration, the reusability of the entire rocket system is core to SpaceX's business model, and the loss snapped a three-year-streak of successful first stage landings.</p>

<p>SpaceX announced it was standing down from launching the next set of Starlink satellites while it reviewed the data.</p>

<p>An earlier attempt to launch Polaris Dawn on Tuesday was scrapped due to a helium leak on a line connecting the tower to the rocket.</p>

<p><strong>High radiation zone</strong></p>

<p>Riding atop a Falcon 9 rocket, the SpaceX Dragon capsule is set to reach a peak altitude of 870 miles (1,400 kilometers) -- higher than any crewed mission in more than half a century, since the Apollo era.</p>

<p>Mission commander Isaacman will guide his four-member team through the mission's centerpiece: the first-ever spacewalk carried out by non-professional astronauts, equipped with sleek, newly developed SpaceX extravehicular activity (EVA) suits.</p>

<p>Rounding out the team are mission pilot Scott Poteet, a retired US Air Force lieutenant colonel; mission specialist Sarah Gillis, a lead space operations engineer at SpaceX; and mission specialist and medical officer Anna Menon, also a lead space operations engineer at SpaceX.</p>

<p>The quartet underwent more than two years of training in preparation for the landmark mission, logging hundreds of hours on simulators as well as skydiving, centrifuge training, scuba diving, and summiting an Ecuadorian volcano.</p>

<p>Polaris Dawn is set to be the first of three missions under the Polaris program, a collaboration between Isaacman, the founder of tech company Shift4 Payments, and SpaceX.</p>

<p>Isaacman declined to reveal his total investment in the project, though reports suggest he paid around $200 million for the SpaceX Inspiration4 mission in September 2021, the first all-civilian orbital mission.</p>

<p>Polaris Dawn will reach its highest altitude on its first day, venturing briefly into the Van Allen radiation belt, a region teeming with high-energy charged particles that can pose health risks to humans over extended periods.</p>

<p>On day three, the crew will don their state-of-the-art EVA spacesuits -- outfitted with heads-up displays, helmet cameras, and advanced joint mobility systems -- and take turns to venture outside their spacecraft in twos.</p>

<p>Each will spend 15 to 20 minutes in space, 435 miles above Earth's surface.</p>

<p>Also on their to-do list are testing laser-based satellite communication between the spacecraft and Starlink, SpaceX's more than 6,000-strong constellation of internet satellites, in a bid to boost space communication speeds, and conducting nearly 40 scientific experiments.</p>

<p>After six days in space, the mission will conclude with the splashdown off the coast of Florida.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A four year old boy accidentally shattered a rare bronze age jar that was on display at an archaeological museum in Haifa, Israel.</p>

<p>The 3,500-year-old ancient artefact had been on display near the entrance of the Hecht Museum without a glass case.</p>

<p><br />
The child's father told the BBC his son "pulled the jar slightly" because he was "curious about what was inside". The man added that he was "in shock" to see his son beside the broken pieces and thought "it wasn't my child that did it".&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Despite the rare incident" the museum said it intends to continue displaying items "without barriers or glass walls" as it believes there is a "special charm" in showing archaeological finds "without obstructions".</p>

<p><br />
"There are instances where display items are intentionally damaged, and such cases are treated with great severity, including involving the police," Lihi Laszlo from the museum told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg2j2y20epo" rel="No follow, no index" target="_blank">the BBC</a>.</p>

<p>"In this case, however, this was not the situation. The jar was accidentally damaged by a young child visiting the museum, and the response will be accordingly."</p>

<p>The jar, which the museum believes dates between 2200 and 1500 BC, was most likely intended to be used to carry local supplies such as wine and olive oil. It was discovered during excavations in Samaria, in central Israel, and has been in the museum for 35 years.</p>

<p>The museum said the artefact was "an impressive find" because similar archaeological items unearthed during excavations are usually broken or incomplete.</p>

<p>An expert has been appointed to restore the jar and it will be displayed again "in a short time", the museum said.</p>

<p>The boy's father said they feel "relieved" to know the jar will be restored but they were apologetic as "it will no longer be the same item".</p>

<p>However, the museum's head Inbal Rivlin told Israeli news outlet Ynet that the boy and his mother have been invited back to the museum for a private tour.</p>

<p>"The museum is not a mausoleum but a living place, open to families (and) accessible. We are appealing to parents: Don't be afraid. Things like this happen. We will fix (the jar) and put it back," the museum head told Ynet.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 29-year-old Australian man has been sentenced to 17 years in prison for one of the worst sextortion cases in the country's history. Muhammad Zain Ul Abideen Rasheed blackmailed hundreds of girls online, many of whom were minors, into performing explicit acts, reported <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp35z4z08qvo" rel="noindex, nofollow"><em>BBC</em></a>.</p>

<p>Rasheed posed as a famous teenager on social media to lure his victims. He would build trust with them before blackmailing them with threats of exposing their private information. Despite his victims' distress and pleas for help, Rasheed continued his harmful actions.</p>

<p>Rasheed manipulated over 250 victims around the globe into performing explicit acts on camera.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Australian Federal Police and the Western Australia Joint Anti-Child Exploitation Team conducted a joint investigation that led to Rasheed's arrest.</p>

<p>"The callous disregard this man had for his victims around the world and their distress, humiliation and fear make it one of the most horrific sextortion cases prosecuted in Australia," said Australian Federal Police Assistant Commissioner David McLean.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When announcing the sentence on Tuesday, Judge Amanda Burrows said Rasheed's offence was of such magnitude there was "no comparable case" in the country, according to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC).</p>

<p>Rasheed pretended to be a 15-year-old American internet star. He would start the conversation with his targets, and later involve them in discussions about sexual fantasies.</p>

<p>Rasheed threatened the victims to send their responses to friends and family unless they performed a series of escalating "degrading" sex acts- which at times included family pets and other children in their home, the BBC reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Western Australia Joint Anti-Child Exploitation Team (WA JACET) first launched an investigation into Rasheed's activities in September 2019.</p>

<p>Several children told him they were suicidal- one event sent images of self-harm. But he continued to blackmail them despite their "obvious distress" and "extreme fear", the judge said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He has been convicted of multiple charges, including sexual assault.&nbsp; He will be eligible to petition for parole in August 2033.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A US appeals court has revived a lawsuit against TikTok by the mother of a 10-year-old girl who died after taking part in a viral "blackout challenge" in which users of the social media platform were dared to choke themselves until they passed out.</p>

<p>While a federal law typically shields internet companies from lawsuits over content posted by users, the Philadelphia-based 3rd US Circuit Court of Appeals on Tuesday ruled the law does not bar Nylah Anderson's mother from pursuing claims that TikTok's algorithm recommended the challenge to her daughter.</p>

<p>US Circuit Judge Patty Shwartz, writing for the three-judge panel, said that Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996 only immunises information provided by third parties and not recommendations TikTok itself made via an algorithm underlying its platform.</p>

<p>She acknowledged the holding was a departure from past court rulings by her court and others holding that Section 230 immunises an online platform from liability for failing to prevent users from transmitting harmful messages to others.</p>

<p>But she said that reasoning no longer held after a US Supreme Court ruling in July on whether state laws designed to restrict the power of social media platforms to curb content they deem objectionable violate their free speech rights.</p>

<p>In those cases, the Supreme Court held a platform's algorithm reflects "editorial judgments" about "compiling the third-party speech it wants in the way it wants." Shwartz said under that logic, content curation using algorithms is speech by the company itself, which is not protected by Section 230.</p>

<p>"TikTok makes choices about the content recommended and promoted to specific users, and by doing so, is engaged in its own first-party speech," she wrote.</p>

<p>TikTok did not respond to requests for comment.</p>

<p>Tuesday's ruling reversed a lower-court judge's decision dismissing on Section 230 grounds the case filed by Tawainna Anderson against TikTok and its Chinese parent company ByteDance.</p>

<p>She sued after her daughter Nylah died in 2021 after attempting the blackout challenge using a purse strap hung in her mother's closet.</p>

<p>"Big Tech just lost its 'get-out-of-jail-free card,'" Jeffrey Goodman, the mother's lawyer, said in a statement.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two members of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's campaign staff had a "verbal and physical altercation" with an Arlington National Cemetery official during a visit by Trump this week, NPR reported on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Trump on Monday participated in a wreath-laying ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery honoring the 13 servicemembers killed during the US withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021.</p>

<p>Later in Detroit, Trump blamed Vice Preisdent Kamala Harris, his Democratic rival for the White House, and President Joe Biden for what he termed a "catastrophic" withdrawal.</p>

<p>Citing an unnamed source, NPR reported that when a cemetery official tried to prevent Trump campaign staffers from filming and photographing in an area where servicemembers are buried, the Trump staff "verbally abused and pushed the official aside."</p>

<p>Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung disputed the report. "There was no physical altercation as described and we are prepared to release footage if such defamatory claims are made," Cheung said.</p>

<p>"The fact is that a private photographer was permitted on the premises and for whatever reason an unnamed individual, clearly suffering from a mental health episode, decided to physically block members of President Trump's team during a very solemn ceremony."</p>

<p>Arlington National Cemetery confirmed in a statement that an incident had occurred and that a report was filed.</p>

<p>"Federal law prohibits political campaign or election-related activities within Army National Military Cemeteries, to include photographers, content creators or any other persons attending for purposes, or in direct support of a partisan political candidate's campaign," the cemetery said.</p>

<p>It did not respond to requests for a copy of the report or an explanation of why the Trump campaign was allowed to visit the cemetery as part of his campaign.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The city of Jenin, a Palestinian militant stronghold in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, has been a hotbed of conflict between the Israeli military and Palestinians in recent years.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The city of Jenin, a Palestinian operative stronghold in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, has been a hotbed of conflict between the Israeli military and Palestinians in recent years.</p>

<p>The Israeli military killed at least nine people on Wednesday in a major operation in the West Bank that involved Jenin and other cities, ratcheting up tensions as a war rages in Gaza between Palestinian group Hamas and Israel.</p>

<p>Here's what you need to know about Jenin.</p>

<h3><strong>Refugee camp</strong></h3>

<p>Jenin is a small city in the hilly, far north of the West Bank, near the border with Israel, and contains a teeming, concrete and cinder-block refugee camp by the same name housing some 14,000 people.</p>

<p>They are descendants of Palestinians displaced when Israel was created in 1948, and most are impoverished and unemployed. This has generated die-hard hostility to Israel and support for Palestinian groups.</p>

<p>Jenin has one of the highest rates of unemployment and poverty among 19 refugee camps in the West Bank, according to UNRWA, a UN agency that delivers basic services to Palestinian refugees.</p>

<p>Alienated from mainstream Palestinian leadership and raised in an era of social media, a new generation of Palestinians has formed a clutch of operative groups in the West Bank such as the Jenin Brigade which includes fighters from Hamas, Islamic Jihad, and Fatah's al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades.</p>

<p>Jenin produced many of the suicide bombers who spearheaded the second Palestinian Intifada, or uprising, between 2000 and 2005. To curb it, Israeli armoured forces carried out devastating raids in the city where operatives had an array of light weapons and a growing arsenal of explosive devices.</p>

<p>The Israeli military regularly accuses the groups of basing fighters within densely populated urban areas such as refugee camps that date back to 1948. Many of the operatives live in the Jenin camp, often with their families.</p>

<p>Since March 2022, Jenin and outlying areas in the north of the West Bank have drawn intensified Israeli raids after a spate of Palestinian street attacks.</p>

<p>Operative groups present in Jenin include the Iran-backed Islamic Jihad and Islamist Hamas.</p>

<h3><strong>Fading Palestinian Authority</strong></h3>

<p>Jenin used to be a bastion of 88-year-old Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas' Fatah faction, a rival of Hamas, which started the Oct. 7 war in Gaza with a cross-border raid on Israel that killed 1,200 people, according to Israeli tallies.</p>

<p>But Fatah has lost ground to Hamas and Islamic Jihad. Their growing presence has arisen in part from inaction by the security forces of Abbas' Western-backed Palestinian Authority (PA), which exercises limited self-rule in parts of the West Bank and says Israel has undercut its credibility on the street.</p>

<p>But their strength also feeds on what critics say is the weakness of Abbas, whose formula of statehood negotiations with Israel collapsed in 2014, with no revival on the horizon, and perceived endemic incompetence and corruption within the PA.</p>

<p>Israel says the Jenin refugee camp is a hub for planning and preparing attacks as well as a safe haven for fighters funded by Hamas or Islamic Jihad.</p>

<p>Battleground during the 2000-2005 Uprising</p>

<p>Jenin was the scene of some of the worst violence during the second Intifada, which began after the collapse of U.S.-backed peace talks in 2000 and mushroomed into an armed conflict between Israel and Palestinian groups.</p>

<p>In April 2002, Israel carried out a major armoured assault on the Jenin refugee camp, part of a wider West Bank operation that Israel said aimed to stop operative attacks including a spate of deadly suicide bombings.</p>

<p>A UN report issued in August 2002 said 52 Palestinians had been killed in Israel's Jenin incursion, as many as half of them civilians, while Israel lost 23 soldiers there.</p>

<p>The report, which disputed a claim by then-Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erekat that 500 people had been killed in Jenin, faulted all combatants for putting civilians in harm's way.</p>

<p>The report listed more Israeli than Palestinian abuses, especially Israel's refusal to let humanitarian workers enter the camp. But it also said Palestinian fighters were lodged in civilian homes.</p>

<h3><strong>Renewed Violence</strong></h3>

<p>Jenin has re-emerged as a flashpoint during the current wave of Israeli-Palestinian violence that has convulsed the West Bank for more than two years, with frequent deadly confrontations.</p>

<p>Violence in Jenin persisted in 2024.</p>

<p>In May Israeli forces killed 10 Palestinians and wounded 25 others. A doctor and a teenager were among those killed during a major operation that involved dozens of vehicles.</p>

<p>In June, Israeli forces killed three Palestinians and wounded at least 13 others in a raid on Jenin.</p>

<p>This month, Israel said it killed two senior Hamas operatives in an airstrike on their car in Jenin.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Police in Vietnam have arrested more than a dozen people in connection with a baby smuggling ring that trafficked 16 newborns across several cities and provinces in the country, state media said Wednesday.</p>

<p>Sixteen men and women have been taken into custody for trading the babies aged between three days and three months old, according to the official newspaper of Ho Chi Minh City Police.</p>

<p>The gang targeted women through closed groups on social media, exploiting those who were struggling to provide and care for their children.</p>

<p>They bought each baby at a cost of between $400 and $930, the report said.</p>

<p>The gang then falsified adoption documents and resold them for between $1,400 and $3,000.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Five days since an Indian woman, Vijaya Lakshmi Gali, disappeared in a sinkhole in Malaysia, authorities in Kuala Lumpur are continuing their round-the-clock search and rescue operation in an attempt to find her.</p>

<p>The Indian High Commission has been in touch with Ms Vijay Lakshmi's family and are updating them about the search and rescue operations.</p>

<p>48-year-old Vijaya Lakshmi Gali, who frequently travels to Malaysia and Singapore for business, disappeared after falling into the 8m-deep hole. She was on her way to the temple when the ground suddenly caved in. Her husband and son managed to escape the collapse.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Japan braced Wednesday for its strongest typhoon of the year, with authorities advising tens of thousands of people to evacuate and issuing the highest warning level for wind and storm surges on the main southern island of Kyushu.</p>

<p>"Typhoon Shanshan is expected to approach southern Kyushu with extremely strong force through Thursday and it may make landfall," Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi told reporters.</p>

<p>"It is expected that violent winds, high waves, and storm surge at levels that many people have never experienced before may occur," said Hayashi, the top government spokesman.</p>

<p>The approach of the storm, packing gusts of up to 252 kilometres (157 miles) per hour and already bringing widespread heavy rain, prompted auto giant Toyota to suspend production at all 14 of its factories.</p>

<p>Two people remained unaccounted for on Wednesday after a landslide buried a house with five family members inside in Gamagori, a city in central Aichi prefecture.</p>

<p>Rescuers worked around the clock and on Wednesday afternoon they pulled out a woman in her 70s.</p>

<p>"She wasn't breathing and was unconscious," a Gamagori official told AFP. They were still searching for a man in his 70s and another in his 30s.</p>

<p>For southern Kyushu, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) predicted 1,100 millimetres (43 inches) of precipitation in the 48 hours to Friday morning, around half the annual average for the area comprising Kagoshima and Miyazaki regions.</p>

<p>The JMA also issued its highest "special warning" for violent storms, waves and high tides in parts of the Kagoshima region of Kyushu, with authorities there advising 56,000 people to evacuate.</p>

<p>Video on public broadcaster NHK TV showed roof tiles being blown off houses, broken windows and felled trees.</p>

<p>"Our carport roof was blown away in its entirety. I wasn't at home when it happened, but my kids say they felt the shaking so strong they thought an earthquake happened," a local resident in Miyazaki told NHK.</p>

<p>"I was surprised. It was completely beyond our imagination," she said.</p>

<p>The warnings indicate the "possibility that a major disaster prompted by (the typhoon) is extremely high," Satoshi Sugimoto, chief forecaster of JMA, told a news conference.</p>

<p>Japan Airlines cancelled 172 domestic flights and six international flights scheduled for Wednesday and Thursday, while ANA nixed 219 domestic flights and four international ones on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday.</p>

<p>The cancellations affected around 25,000 people.</p>

<p>Kyushu Railway said it would suspend some Shinkansen bullet train services between Kumamoto and Kagoshima Chuo from Wednesday night and warned of further possible disruption.</p>

<p>Trains between Tokyo and Fukuoka, the most populous city in Kyushu, may also be cancelled depending on weather conditions this week, other operators said.</p>

<p>Shanshan comes in the wake of Typhoon Ampil, which disrupted hundreds of flights and trains this month.</p>

<p>Despite dumping heavy rain, it caused only minor injuries and damage.</p>

<p>Ampil came days after Tropical Storm Maria brought record rains to northern areas.</p>

<p>Typhoons in the region have been forming closer to coastlines, intensifying more rapidly and lasting longer over land due to climate change, according to a study released last month.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

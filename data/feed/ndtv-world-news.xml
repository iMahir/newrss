       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Norway has raised its terrorism threat assessment to the second-highest level due to an increased risk of attacks against Jewish and Israeli targets, the national police directorate said on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Last week police in neighbouring Denmark charged two men suspected of detonating hand grenades near Israel's Copenhagen embassy, while police in Sweden are investigating a suspected shooting near the Israeli diplomatic mission in Stockholm.</p>

<p>Norwegian police officers, who are normally unarmed, will now carry guns nationwide as a result of the decision by the PST security service to raise the threat level, the directorate said.</p>

<p>"PST raises the terror threat level in Norway from moderate to high as a result of the ongoing escalation of the conflict in the Middle East," the police said in a statement.</p>

<p>"It is primarily the threat to Jewish and Israeli targets that has been further intensified," the statement said.</p>

<p>The PST risk assessment was raised from level three (moderate) to level four (high), on PST's five-point scale where the top end of the range would indicate imminent danger.</p>

<p>National Police Commissioner Benedicte Bjoernland said there was an increased likelihood of attempted terrorism.</p>

<p>"...we have a number of measures in place to protect the population," she said in a statement.</p>

<p>Sweden in August last year raised its terrorist alert to the second-highest level after Koran burnings outraged Muslims and triggered threats from jihadists.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A doctor in the United Kingdom has admitted trying to kill his mother's long-term partner by injecting him with a fake Covid-19 booster that caused a flesh-eating bacterial disease. According to <em>The Guardian</em>, 53-year-old Thomas Kwan had been a respected and experienced General Practioner (GP) in Sunderland when he devised the elaborate plan to kill Patrick O'Hara, 72, at his mother's home on January 22. He injected the 72-year-old with the fake shot under the disguise of a community nurse. The Hong Kong-born doctor wanted to kill Mr O'Hara so he could inherit his mother's estate when she died, a court heard on Thursday.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Initially, Mr Kwan denied attempted murder but he changed his plea on Monday this week after the prosecution opened the case against him. <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/oct/07/gp-admits-attempted-of-mothers-partner-with-fake-covid-jab" rel="noindex, nofollow"><em>The Guardian</em></a> reported that over several months, the 53-year-old plotted to get access to his victim using shell companies, counterfeit documents and elaborate disguises.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Kwan sent two fake doctor's letters stating that the 72-year-old was due for a home visit for his Covid-19 injections. On the day of the visit, he then checked himself into a hotel under a false name and later headed to his mother Jenny Leung's house posing as a nurse. He allegedly spent 45 minutes at the property as he carried out medical tests and administered the fake booster to Mr O'Hara. Kwan told the court that he administered to Mr O'Hara in an attempt to create "no more than mild pain and discomfort".&nbsp;</p>

<p>The outlet reported that Mr O'Hara felt "terrible pain" after the injection and went to the hospital where doctors diagnosed him with a "rare and life-threatening disease" called necrotizing fasciitis - a flesh-eating disease that can develop very quickly into a life-threatening emergency. Following the injection, he remained in intensive care for weeks as doctor cut flesh from his arm in an attempt to combat the disease.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"From November 2023 at the latest, and probably long before then, [Kwan] devised an intricate plan to kill his mother's long-term partner Patrick O'Hara ... It was a plan to murder a man in plain sight, to murder a man right in front of his own mother's eyes," prosecutor Peter Makepeace said in court.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to The Guardian, jurors were told that Ms Leung named her longtime partner Mr O'Hara in her will so he could remain in her house. This decision put a "strain" on her relationship with her son.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The judge, Mrs Justice Lambert, said Kwan would face a "substantial" prison term at his sentencing on 17 October.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A son of Al Qaeda founder Osama bin Laden has been barred from returning to France, where he lived for years painting landscapes in a Normandy village, after allegedly posting comments on social media deemed to have glorified terrorism.</p>

<p>Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau said he had signed an order banning Omar Binladin from France after the judiciary confirmed the legality of a prior deportation order issued on grounds of national security.</p>

<p>Retailleau gave no details about the timing of the deportation or where Binladin had been sent.</p>

<p>"Mr Binladin, who has lived in the Orne region for several years as the spouse of a British national, posted comments on his social networks in 2023 that glorified terrorism," Retailleau said on X.</p>

<p>"The administrative ban ensures that Mr Binladin cannot return to France for any reason whatsoever."</p>

<p>Binladin could not be reached for comment.</p>

<p>Pascal Martin, who helped Binladin sell his paintings, described him as a man who opposed Islamist ideology, who earned a living from his artwork and paid his taxes. Binladin was currently in Qatar, Martin said.</p>

<p>"We became friends and I can tell you that nothing that is being said resembles the Omar I know," Martin told Reuters.</p>

<p>According to local weekly newspaper Le Publicateur Libre, Binladin caught the attention of French authorities over a social media post on the anniversary of his father's birthday. Osama bin Laden was killed by U.S. forces in 2011.</p>

<p>Reuters was not immediately able to locate the social media post. Martin said Binladin had told friends his social media account had been hacked.</p>

<p>The paper reported in July 2023 that police had searched for Binladin in the village of Domfort, Normandy.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Weather-weary Florida girded Tuesday for a hit from Hurricane Milton, a monster storm packing furious winds and the threat of walls of water gushing inland.</p>

<p>As the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/category-5-hurricane-milton-approaches-florida-2nd-major-storm-in-weeks-6740696" target="_blank">second huge hurricane</a> in as many weeks rumbled toward the state's battered west coast, a sense of looming catastrophe spread as people raced to board up their homes and evacuate to shelters or anywhere they could.</p>

<p>As of Tuesday morning, Milton was generating maximum sustained winds of 145 mph (230 kph) and the threat of as much as 15 feet of storm surge, the National Hurricane Center said, calling it an "extremely dangerous" storm, and urging people to heed evacuation orders.</p>

<p>The Category 4 hurricane was to move just north of Mexico's Yucatan peninsula on Tuesday, it said.</p>

<p>After weakening from a maximum Category 5 overnight, it is forecast to make landfall Wednesday night on the coast of Florida and remain powerful as it churns across the state.</p>

<p>At a press conference Tuesday, Governor Ron Santis ticked off town after town and county after county that are in danger.</p>

<p>"Basically the entire peninsula portion of Florida is under some type of either a watch or a warning," he said.</p>

<p>The mayor of Tampa, a metropolitan area of three million that was hit hard last month by Hurricane Helene, was blunt in her own assessment.</p>

<p>"Helene was a wake-up call. This is literally catastrophic," Mayor Jane Castor said on CNN.</p>

<p>"I can say this without any dramatization whatsoever: If you choose to stay in one of those evacuation areas, you are going to die."</p>

<h2><strong>'Just horrific'</strong></h2>

<p>One Florida TV meteorologist choked back tears as he talked about how Milton had intensified rapidly from a Category 1.</p>

<p>"I apologize," weatherman John Morales said, as he surveyed the data. "This is just horrific."</p>

<p>The National Weather Service said that Milton could be the worst storm to hit the Tampa area in more than 100 years.</p>

<p>Scientists say global warming has a role in these intense storms as warmer ocean surfaces release more water vapor, providing additional energy for storms, which intensifies their winds.</p>

<p>Communities hit by the deadly Hurricane Helene, which slammed Florida late last month, rushed to remove debris that could become dangerous projectiles as Milton approaches.</p>

<p>The back-to-back hurricanes have ignited political bickering ahead of the upcoming US election.</p>

<p>DeSantis, a conservative known to clash with the federal government, came under fire after broadcaster NBC reported he was ignoring phone calls from Vice President Kamala Harris on the Helene recovery.</p>

<p>DeSantis did speak to President Joe Biden about the Milton preparations, the White House said.</p>

<p>Harris slammed the Republican governor for "playing political games."</p>

<p>Former president Donald Trump has tapped into real frustration about the federal response after Helene and fueled it with disinformation, falsely claiming disaster money had been spent instead on migrants.</p>

<p>In Mexico's Yucatan, workers boarded up glass doors and windows, fishermen hauled boats ashore and schools were suspended.</p>

<p>In the southeastern United States, emergency workers are still struggling to provide relief after Helene, which killed at least 230 people across several states.</p>

<p>It hit the Florida coastline on September 26 as a major Category 4 hurricane, causing massive flooding in remote inland towns in states further north, including North Carolina and Tennessee.</p>

<p>Helene was the deadliest natural disaster to hit the US mainland since 2005's Hurricane Katrina, with the death count still rising.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Derrick Anderson, an army veteran and a Republican Party candidate running for an open seat in Virginia's seventh district, posted a video which featured a typical 'family photo' of him with a woman and three girls, reported The New York Times.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the highly anticipated US polls are approaching, candidates across parties are gearing up to bag as many votes as possible using unique campaign strategies. One Republican candidate went as far as borrowing his friend's wife and children to pose for what seems like a family photo.</p>

<p>Derrick Anderson, an army veteran and a Republican Party candidate running for an open seat in Virginia's seventh district, posted a video which featured a typical 'family photo' of him with a woman and three girls, reported <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/27/us/politics/republican-candidates-wives-ads.html">The New York Times</a>. However, the woman and the three girls in the deceptive photo are unrelated to Mr Anderson, who is unmarried and lives with his dog, says his campaign website. In another shot, Mr Anderson can be seen sitting on a dining table with the same woman and the girls.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mr Anderson's campaign later clarified that the woman and girls in the photo are actually the wife and daughters of his friend. He is engaged and has posted videos on social media with his fiancee in the past.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The republican candidate has, however, drawn flak from several social media users for the photos, now in wide circulation on social media. Eugene Vindman, his democratic opponent from the seat, was quick to call him out. "Derrick Anderson invented a fake family so that voters in Virginia's 7th would like him," said Mr Vindman in a post on X.&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>In another post, Mr Vindman said, "The definition of MAGA "family values" now includes borrowing a wife and kids for a political ad thanks to Derrick Anderson. If Derrick deceives you about his family, how can we trust him to stand up to his own party on Project 2025?"</p>

<p>Mr Anderson's spokesperson however said that "Derrick's opponent and every other candidate in America are in similar pictures and video with supporters of all kinds" when approached by the NYT for a reaction. He also said that the video showed Mr Anderson with "female friends and supporters", according to the NYT.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An Airbnb host in the US was forced to add 'no cryptocurrency mining' to the list of instructions after a bizarre guest experience. According to <em>Business Insider</em>, Airbnb host Ashley Class revealed in a video posted to TikTok that she had banned crypto mining in her short-term rentals after she got a massive electricity bill of $1,500 (approximately Rs 1.25 lakh). The guests initially seemed like model renters. They were "five stars all the way," Ms Class said, with no issues or hiccups during their three-week stay. However, this was until the guests made her rental property a makeshift crypto-mining hub and ran up $1,500 in utility charges.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ms Class said that after she received the shocking electricity bill, she looked at footage from her outdoor camera. She saw that the guests had hauled in at least 10 computer rigs, which she later figured out were for crypto mining.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"It was cheaper for them to rent a house than to pay for that electricity," Ms Class said in the video, per <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.businessinsider.in/thelife/news/an-airbnb-host-had-to-ban-crypto-mining-after-guests-racked-up-a-1500-electric-bill/articleshow/112427481.cms" rel="noindex. nofollow "><em>Business Insider</em></a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Notably, cryptocurrency mining is a process that involves solving complex mathematical problems to earn digital currency. The whole process requires significant computational power which needs a huge amount of electricity. The practice has even been outlawed in some parts of China due to environmental and financial concerns over the rise of crypto mining.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Airbnb host stated that she messaged the guests and explained she would be charging them for the exorbitant electricity bill. However, the guests fought her until she got Airbnb involved and shared documentation of the incident.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The guests apparently had the funds to repay her. Ms Class revealed in the comments section that the guests made $100,000 (approximately Rs 84 Lakh) during their three-week stay.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in the comments section of Ms Class' video, a number of Airbnb hosts mentioned that they have also explicitly banned crypto mining in their listings. "I also have in my rules no crypto mining. It's ridiculous we have to do this," one user wrote. "I've never heard of this, but thanks for the heads up! Heading to update my listing," commented another.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hezbollah's deputy secretary general Sheikh Naim Qassem, who said on Tuesday that the armed group supported efforts to reach a ceasefire for Lebanon, has been a senior figure in the Iran-backed movement for more than 30 years.</p>

<p>Speaking in front of curtains from an undisclosed location, Qassem said the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/regional-tensions-mount-as-israel-trades-strikes-with-gaza-lebanon-on-anniversary-war-with-hamas-6741677" target="_blank">conflict between Hezbollah and Israel</a> was a war about who cries first, and Hezbollah would not cry first. The group's capabilities were intact despite "painful blows" from Israel.</p>

<p>But he added the group supported the efforts of parliament speaker Nabih Berri - a Hezbollah ally - to secure a ceasefire, for the first time omitting any mention of a Gaza truce deal as a pre-condition for halting the group's fire on Israel.</p>

<p>His 30-minute televised address comes just days after senior Hezbollah figure Hashem Safieddine is thought to have been the target of an Israeli strike and 11 days after the killing of Hezbollah's secretary general Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah.</p>

<p>Qassem was appointed deputy chief in 1991 by the armed group's then-secretary general Abbas al-Musawi, who was killed by an Israeli helicopter attack the following year.</p>

<p>Qassem remained in his role when Nasrallah became leader, and has long been one of Hezbollah's leading spokesmen, conducting interviews with foreign media including as cross-border hostilities with Israel raged over the last year.</p>

<p>Qassem's televised address on Tuesday was his second since hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah intensified in September.</p>

<p>He was the first member of Hezbollah's top leadership to make televised remarks after <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/iran-says-top-commander-of-quds-force-esmail-qaani-survived-israeli-strike-on-hassan-nasrallahs-likely-heir-6740497" target="_blank">Nasrallah's killing</a> in an Israeli air attack on Beirut's southern suburbs on Sept. 27.</p>

<p>Speaking on Sept. 30, Qassem said Hezbollah would choose a successor to its secretary general "at the earliest opportunity" and would continue to fight Israel in solidarity with Palestinians.</p>

<p>"What we are doing is the bare minimum... We know that the battle may be long," he said in a 19-minute speech.</p>

<p>Born in 1953 in Beirut to a family from Lebanon's south, Qassem's political activism began with the Lebanese Shi'ite Amal Movement.</p>

<p>He left the group in 1979 in the wake of Iran's Islamic Revolution, which shaped the political thinking of many young Lebanese Shi'ite activists.</p>

<p>Qassem took part in meetings that led to the formation of Hezbollah, established with the backing of Iran's Revolutionary Guards in response to the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982.</p>

<p>He has been the general coordinator of Hezbollah's parliamentary election campaigns since the group first contested them in 1992.</p>

<p>In 2005, he wrote a history of Hezbollah seen as a rare "insider's look" into the organisation. Qassem wears a white turban unlike Nasrallah and Safieddine, whose black turbans denoted their status as descendants of the Prophet Muhammad.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Geoffery E Hinton said he was an avid user of AI tools such as ChatGPT, but also conceded that he had concerns about the potential impact of the technology.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Geoffrey E Hinton, known as the Godfather of artificial Intelligence and <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/nobel-prize-in-physics-goes-to-john-hopfield-geoffrey-hinton-for-work-on-machine-learning-6743213">co-winner of the Nobel Prize for Physics 2024</a>, raised concerns about the technology he has created.</p>

<p>The 76-year-old University of Toronto professor said machine learning and AI will have a significant influence on humankind's future, comparing it to the Industrial Revolution, but flagged the threat of these systems “getting out of control”. “Instead of exceeding people in physical strength, it will exceed people in intellectual ability. People will be able to do the same amount of work with an AI assistant in much lesser time. But there is always the threat of these things getting out of control,” Mr Hinton said.</p>

<p>He further said that his fear is the systems will become more intelligent that people, and eventually take control.</p>

<p>American John Hopfield and British-Canadian Geoffrey Hinton won the Nobel Prize in Physics on Tuesday for pioneering work in the development of artificial intelligence. The pair were honoured "for foundational discoveries and inventions that enable machine learning with artificial neural networks," the jury said.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/its-an-earthquake-says-gary-ruvkun-2024-nobel-prize-in-medicine-winner-6736827"><strong>"Its An Earthquake," Says Gary Ruvkun, 2024 Nobel Prize In Medicine Winner</strong></a></p>

<p>"These artificial neural networks have been used to advance research across physics topics as diverse as particle physics, material science and astrophysics," Ellen Moons, chair of the Nobel Committee for Physics, told a press conference. Moons also noted that these tools have also become part of our daily lives, including in facial recognition and language translation.</p>

<p>The jury said Hinton, a 76-year-old professor at the University of Toronto, "invented a method that can autonomously find properties in data, and so perform tasks such as identifying specific elements in pictures."</p>

<p>Hinton said he used AI tools such as ChatGPT4 “for almost everything. But it is not a very good expert, and that is good”.</p>

<p>"I'm flabbergasted, I had no idea this would happen," Hinton told reporters via a phone interview as the laureates were announced in Stockholm. Speaking in a lighter vein, he added, “I'm in a cheap hotel in California that doesn't have an internet connection or a very good phone connection. I was going to get an MRI scan today, but I will have to cancel.”</p>

<p>The Nobel Prize in Medicine Prize was awarded on Monday to American scientists Victor Ambros and Gary Ruvkun. The US duo were honoured for their discovery of microRNA and its role in how genes are regulated. The physics prize will be followed by the chemistry prize on Wednesday, with the highly watched literature and peace prizes to be announced on Thursday and Friday respectively. The economics prize wraps up the 2024 Nobel season on October 14.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Deforestation continued last year at a rate far beyond pledges to end the practice by 2030, according to a major study published Tuesday.</p>

<p>Forests nearly the size of Ireland were lost in 2023, according to two dozen research organisations, NGOs and advocacy groups, with 6.37 million hectares (15.7 million acres) of trees felled and burned.</p>

<p>This "significantly exceeded" levels that would have kept the world on track to eliminate deforestation by the end of the decade, a commitment made in 2021 by more than 140 leaders.</p>

<p>Forests are home to 80 percent of the world's terrestrial plant and animal species and crucial for regulating water cycles and sequestering CO2, the main greenhouse gas responsible for global warming.</p>

<p>"Globally, deforestation has gotten worse, not better, since the beginning of the decade," said Ivan Palmegiani, a biodiversity and land use consultant at Climate Focus and lead author of the "Forest Declaration Assessment" report.</p>

<p>"We're only six years away from a critical global deadline to end deforestation, and forests continue to be chopped down, degraded, and set ablaze at alarming rates."</p>

<p>In 2023, 3.7 million hectares of tropical primary forest -- particularly carbon rich and ecologically biodiverse environments -- disappeared, a figure that should have fallen significantly to meet the 2030 objective.</p>

<p><strong>Soya and nickel</strong></p>

<p>In high-risk regions, researchers pointed to backsliding in Bolivia and in Indonesia.~CHECK~</p>

<p>The report said there was an "alarming rise" in deforestation in Bolivia, which jumped 351 percent between 2015 and 2023.</p>

<p>The "trend shows no sign of abating", it added, with forests largely cleared for agriculture, notably for soya but also beef and sugar.</p>

<p>In Indonesia, deforestation slumped between 2020-2022 but started rising sharply last year.</p>

<p>Ironically, that is partly down to demand for materials often seen as eco-friendly, such as viscose for clothing, and a surge in nickel mining for electric vehicle batteries and renewable energy technologies.</p>

<p>There was better news from Brazil.</p>

<p>While it remains the country with the highest deforestation rates in the world, it has made key progress.</p>

<p>The situation has significantly improved in the Amazon, which has benefited from protective measures put in place by President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.</p>

<p>However, in the Cerrado, a key tropical savannah below the Amazon, deforestation has increased.</p>

<p><strong>Degraded forests</strong></p>

<p>The report also highlights the role of logging, road building and fires in forest degradation, when land is damaged but not razed entirely.</p>

<p>In 2022, the last year data was available, a forest area twice the size of Germany was degraded.</p>

<p>Erin Matson, senior consultant at Climate Focus, and co-author of the report, said "strong policies and strong enforcement" were needed.</p>

<p>"To meet global forest protection targets, we must make forest protection immune to political and economic whims," she said.</p>

<p>The report comes in the wake of the European Commission's proposal last week to postpone by a year (to the end of 2025) the entry into force of its anti-deforestation law, despite protests from NGOs.</p>

<p>"We have to fundamentally rethink our relationship with consumption and our models of production to shift away from a reliance on over exploiting natural resources," said Matson.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gaza's civil defence agency on Tuesday said an Israeli strike killed at least 17 people at a refugee camp in the centre of the territory, as Israel's military targets Hamas positions.</p>

<p>"The civil defence teams recovered 17 martyrs, including children, and several others who were wounded from the three-story home of the Abdul Hadi family, which was bombed by a missile from an (Israeli) warplane in Al-Bureij refugee camp in central Gaza," agency spokesman Mahmud Bassal said in a statement.</p>

<p>Bassal said the bodies of those killed and the wounded were taken to Al-Awda hospital in Nuseirat camp and to Al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital in the city of Deir el-Balah.</p>

<p>Medics at Al-Awda confirmed the death count.</p>

<p>Bassal earlier told AFP that several air strikes rocked central and northern parts of Gaza since the early hours of Tuesday.</p>

<p>Witnesses and rescuers also said Israeli military operations continued in Jabaliya, where troops launched a ground assault in recent days.</p>

<p>Over the past day, Israeli forces killed "approximately 20 terrorists" in air strikes in Jabaliya, the military said in a statement, adding troops also dismantled a weapons storage facility in the area.</p>

<p>On Sunday, the military said troops had encircled Jabaliya in response to indications Hamas was regrouping there despite a year of strikes and hard fighting.</p>

<p>In recent months, troops have returned to several areas across the Palestinian territory where they had previously conducted operations against Hamas, only to find operators rebuilding.</p>

<p>In a separate statement, the military announced it had killed three Hamas operators who had participated in the October 7 attack.</p>

<p>They were killed in an air strike on September 30 that struck a school in Daraj Tuffah area.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The top Commander of Iran's Quds Force Esmail Qaani is in 'good health', the force's deputy commander Iraj Masjedi said on Monday, after Iranian security sources told Reuters he had been out of contact since strikes on Beirut last week.</p>

<p>"He is in good health and is carrying out his activities. Some ask us to issue a statement... there is no need for this", Masjedi was quoted as saying by state media in reference to Qaani.</p>

<p>One of the officials speaking to Reuters said Qaani was in Beirut's southern suburbs, known as the Dahiyeh, during a strike last week that was reported to have targeted senior Hezbollah official Hashem Safieddine. The official said he was not meeting Safieddine.</p>

<p>Israel has been hitting multiple targets in Dahiyeh as it pursues a campaign against Iran-backed Lebanese group Hezbollah.</p>

<p>Tehran named Qaani the head of the Revolutionary Guards Corps' overseas military-intelligence service after the United States assassinated his powerful predecessor Qassem Soleimani in a drone strike in Baghdad in 2020.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Billionaire Elon Musk suggested on Monday that he would end up in prison if US Vice President Kamala Harris beats Donald Trump in the upcoming presidential election. After appearing alongside Mr Trump at a weekend rally, Mr Musk used a two-hour chat with Tucker Carlson to push right-wing talking points. "If he (Donald Trump) loses, I'm f****d," Mr Musk told Mr Carlson in an interview broadcast on X (formerly Twitter). "How long do you think my prison sentence is going to be? Will I see my children? I don't know," he quipped.&nbsp;</p>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Mr Musk's interview with Mr Carlson comes after he endorsed Donald Trump and appeared alongside the Republican on Saturday at his rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. During the interview, Mr Musk ramped up his public support for Donald Trump, telling Mr Carlson that he is "all in" on the Republic presidential candidate.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"My view is that if Trump doesn't win this election it's the last election we are going to have," Mr Musk said, explaining that he fears millions of migrants that the Harris-Biden administration "has been importing" will eventually be granted citizenship and tip future votes permanently.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"My prediction is, if there is another four years of a Democratic administration, they will legalize so many illegals that the next election, there will be no swing states," he predicted, forecasting that will lead to "single-party rule."&nbsp;</p>

<p>To back his stance, Mr Musk cited the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act, which guaranteed amnesty to millions of migrants in the country illegally, the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/10/07/us-news/elon-musk-suggests-hell-be-thrown-in-prison-if-harris-beats-trump-if-he-loses-im-fed/" rel="noindex, nofollow"><em>New York Post </em></a>reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Thereafter, California turned very strongly Dem," he said. "You just need enough [new citizens] for there to not be swing states. I think we want to remain a democracy and we don't want to become a one-party state. The people who are saying Trump is a threat to democracy are themselves a threat to democracy. One party-rule is not democracy," Mr Musk said.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>French authorities have ordered Omar bin Laden, a son of dead Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, to leave the country over posts on social media, France's interior minister announced on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Born in Saudi Arabia, where he spent his early years, Omar bin Laden, 43, has also lived in Sudan and Afghanistan. He left his father at the age of 19 and eventually settled in Normandy in northern France in 2016, taking up painting.</p>

<p>France's new interior minister, Bruno Retailleau, said on X (former Twitter) that Omar bin Laden had lived in the department of Orne in Normandy as a spouse of a British national.</p>

<p>The minister said that the jihadist's son "posted comments on his social networks in 2023 that advocated terrorism."</p>

<p>"As a result, the prefect of Orne issued an order to leave French territory," Retailleau said.</p>

<p>"The courts have confirmed the legality of this decision taken in the interests of national security," he added.</p>

<p>The interior minister also said he had signed off on a ban preventing Omar bin Laden "to return to France for any reason whatsoever."</p>

<p>He did not provide further details and it was not clear if Omar bin Laden had already left France.</p>

<p>Omar bin Laden's marriage to British woman Jane Felix-Browne, a grandmother who had been divorced five times previously and over two decades his senior, had caused considerable media interest when it was confirmed in 2007.</p>

<p>After marriage she took on the Muslim name of Zaina Mohammed. Omar bin Laden sought to live in the UK, but his bid was rejected by the British authorities.</p>

<p>Osama bin Laden, himself the son of a hugely wealthy Saudi construction magnate, is believed to have had some two dozen children.</p>

<p>US special forces killed the Al-Qaeda founder in Pakistan in 2011.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two friends, Tara Kehidi and Teresa Araujo were allegedly removed from a Spirit Airlines flight from Los Angeles to New Orleans on October 4 due to their attire. Initially wearing sweaters, they removed them due to the plane's lack of air conditioning, revealing crop tops that showed a small portion of their midriffs. According to the <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/10/07/lifestyle/sexist-flight-attendant-boots-female-passengers-over-crop-tops/">New York Post</a></em>, a&nbsp;male flight attendant approached them, instructing them to "put something on." When asked about a dress code policy, the attendant reportedly walked away. The women claimed they were never shown a policy or given a clear explanation.</p>

<p>"We were just wearing crop tops, a little bit of stomach showing," Kehidi explained. "It was confusing, and it felt discriminatory."</p>

<p>Passengers defended them, but a supervisor intervened, threatening police involvement if they didn't leave. The women and a mother with a toddler were escorted off. Ms&nbsp;Araujo claims the supervisor promised to rebook but later refused, citing no available flights.&nbsp;She later took to social media on October 6 to share her side of the story, posting a series of videos recounting the events leading up to her and her friend Tara Kehidi's removal from the Spirit Airlines flight.</p>

<p>''This is appalling service, that in 2024 we are getting kicked out of a plane for ONE MALE flight attendant not liking our shirts. Everyone working at the airport agreed this was an act of prejudice, discrimination and misogynist and that we should take legal actions,'' Ms&nbsp;Araujo wrote on Instagram.</p>

<p>Ms Araujo further alleged that she had to spend $1,000 to rebook another flight with a different airline.&nbsp;The two friends also claimed they did offer to put their sweaters back on multiple times in order to not get kicked off, but the flight attendant told them it was too late.</p>

<p>"We were kind of embarrassed as well, because we felt we were being treated like... like criminals, you know. Everyone in the plane was looking at us," she told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://abc7chicago.com/post/2-women-say-spirit-airlines-flight-attendant-kicked-off-plane-going-los-angeles-new-orleans-wearing-crop-tops/15402882/"><em>ABC7 Chicago.</em></a></p>

<p>They say they are now interested in taking legal action.</p>

<p>The incident has sparked debate about airline dress codes and potential biases. Spirit Airlines' policy states that passengers should dress "appropriately" but doesn't specify guidelines for midriff-baring tops.</p>

<p>In a statement sent to&nbsp;<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/spirit-airlines-passengers-crop-tops-flight-b2625381.html"><em>The Independent</em></a>, a representative for Spirit Airlines said: “Our Contract of Carriage, a document all Guests agree to upon making a reservation with us, includes certain clothing standards for all Guests travelling with us. We are investigating the matter, and we are in contact with the Guests about their experience.”</p>

<p>The Contract of Carriage, as published on Spirit Airlines' website, states that any passenger may be forced to leave the aircraft if said traveller is “inadequately clothed, or whose clothing is lewd, obscene or offensive in nature.”</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p>

<p>The German convicted rapist and main suspect in the 2007 disappearance of British toddler Madeleine McCann was on Tuesday cleared of all charges in an unrelated sex crimes trial.</p>

<p>The case has been closely watched because the acquittal means 47-year-old Christian Brueckner could be released from jail as early as next year, according to court officials.</p>

<p>State prosecutors said they would appeal the verdict handed down in the court in the central city of Brunswick.</p>

<p>Brueckner is currently behind bars, serving a sentence for raping a 72-year-old US tourist in 2005 in Praia da Luz -- the same Portuguese seaside resort where Madeleine went missing two years later.</p>

<p>Prosecutors in Brueckner's latest trial had called for him to be jailed for a further 15 years, describing him as a "dangerous psychopathic sadist".</p>

<p>However, the presiding judge Uta Engemann said Brueckner could "not be convicted of the acts he is accused of" because of insufficient evidence and ruled: "The defendant is acquitted."</p>

<p>Brueckner, a tall man with blond hair, blue eyes and sporting the same grey coat he has worn throughout the hearings, showed no visible reaction to the verdict.</p>

<p>He was revealed as a suspect in 2020 in a bombshell development in the "Maddie" investigation, one of the highest-profile missing persons cases in history.</p>

<p>German prosecutors have not charged him over Madeleine's disappearance, although they also say investigations are continuing and that they are certain that Madeleine is dead.</p>

<p>Two years ago, Brueckner was charged with five separate counts of rape and child sex abuse that prosecutors alleged he had committed in Portugal between 2000 and 2017.</p>

<p>The charges came about as a result of investigations into the "Maddie" case, according to prosecutors.</p>

<p><strong>Lack of hard evidence</strong></p>

<p>In one of the alleged cases, Brueckner was accused of entering the holiday apartment of a woman aged between 70 and 80, tying her up and beating and sexually assaulting her.</p>

<p>In another, prosecutors said he had entered a young Irish woman's apartment via her balcony while she was sleeping, threatening her with a knife and raping her several times.</p>

<p>He had also been accused of exposing himself to a 10-year-old German girl on a beach and to an 11-year-old Portuguese girl at a playground.</p>

<p>Notebooks seized from Brueckner detailing his sexual fantasies were also used as evidence. But, despite their disturbing content, they provided no direct link to the alleged crimes.</p>

<p>The presiding judge, Engemann, labelled some of the witness testimonies as "inconsistent" and "almost worthless".</p>

<p>She acknowledged that the verdict might be "unsatisfactory" for the victims but said the judges were bound by their oath to impartiality and not the expectations of prosecutors, the media or the public.</p>

<p>Christian Wolters, a spokesman for the prosecution, told AFP that "we consider the judgement to be wrong in substance and will therefore appeal so that the Federal Court of Justice will review the decision again for legal errors".</p>

<p><strong>Missing without trace</strong></p>

<p>In July, Brueckner's lawyers had first succeeded in having an arrest warrant against him cancelled as there was no longer deemed to be an "urgent suspicion" that he committed the five offences.</p>

<p>The move at the time was a technicality as Brueckner remained behind bars. But his lawyer, Friedrich Fuelscher, argued that the court's decision was a "clear sign that the defendant will be acquitted".</p>

<p>Brueckner's current rape sentence runs until September 2025, according to Wolters, although Fuelscher has said the defendant could be free as soon as the spring.</p>

<p>Three-year-old Madeleine went missing from her family's holiday apartment in Portugal's Algarve region in May 2007 while her parents were dining at a nearby tapas bar.</p>

<p>Despite a huge international manhunt and global media attention, no trace of her has been found.</p>

<p>Investigations are continuing in the "Maddie" case and would proceed regardless of the outcome of the trial, Wolters told AFP earlier this week.</p>

<p>"At present, I am unable to say when we will be able to conclude these investigations and with what result," he said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An American woman, presumed to have been killed by a shark while diving in Indonesia, possibly died from a medical condition before any encounter with the predator, according to her friend.</p>

<p>Colleen Monfore, 68, a mother of two and a Michigan resident, was on what was meant to be a dream diving holiday - a seven-week excursion with her husband Mike - when tragedy struck on September 26, said family friend Rick Sass.</p>

<p>Just days into their adventure, Monfore went missing during a group dive near Pulau Redang island, reported <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/10/07/us-news/american-eaten-by-shark-in-indonesia-may-have-had-medical-issue/">The New York Post</a>. Two weeks later, fishermen discovered a shark and retrieved human remains from its stomach, around 113 km away from the location of her disappearance. Authorities later identified Monfore through fingerprints, according to Sass, who has been in regular contact with the family.</p>

<p>“We do not believe this was a shark attack. Mike thinks she suffered some kind of medical issue in the water,” Sass told the New York Post.</p>

<p>Sass and his wife, Kim, who co-owned a dive shop for more than four decades, reviewed photos from the dive, engaged in conversations with Mike and analysed data from his diving computer.</p>

<p>Sass said that Monfore may have become separated from her group due to rough waters and was not killed by a shark. At the time of her disappearance, she was around 24 feet underwater and likely had half a tank of air remaining, according to the New York Post report.</p>

<p>"There was a down current at the turnaround site, but it was manageable. I've easily done 1000+ dives with this gracious woman. I don't believe it was the environment and certainly not a shark that ended her life,” Kim Sass mentioned in a Facebook post.</p>

<p>Rick Sass said, “They dove massive numbers of trips with us over 30 years. Bali, Philippines, Bikini Atoll, you name it. She knew what she was doing,” adding, “We used to call her ‘Saint Colleen.' She was an amazing woman. She loved nature and animals. I know she would have never wanted a shark to be blamed for this tragedy."</p>

<p>Sass also noted that shark attacks on divers were extremely uncommon. "And sharks are not that way. We've dived with hammerheads, tiger sharks, and bull sharks. You have to give them respect and be cautious, but they won't just attack you," he said.</p>

<p>The circumstances surrounding Colleen Monfore's death remain unclear. Images from the scene show the shark cut open, with human remains in a black wetsuit nearby.</p>

<p>"The shark was caught, but it was not in normal health. I thought it had swallowed plastic or a fishing net. It was cut open to find the problem, and inside there were the remains of a woman,” told a fisherman, as reported by Asia Pacific Press.</p>

<p>Indonesian authorities have announced that an investigation is underway.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Scientists John Hopfield and Geoffrey Hinton won the 2024 Nobel Prize in Physics for discoveries and inventions that enable machine learning within artificial neural networks, the award-giving body said on Tuesday.</p>

<p>The award comes with a prize sum of 11 million Swedish crowns ($1.1 million), which is shared between the winners if there are several. The physics prize is awarded by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.</p>

<p>"This year's two Nobel Laureates in physics have used tools from physics to develop methods that are the foundation of today's powerful machine learning," the award-giving body said in a statement.</p>

<p>Widely considered the most prestigious prize for physicists across the world, it was created, along with awards for achievements in science, literature and peace, in the will of Alfred Nobel.</p>

<p>The prizes have been awarded with a few interruptions since 1901, though the Nobel economics honour is a later addition in memory of the Swedish businessman and philanthropist, who had made a fortune from his invention of dynamite.</p>

<p>Outside the sometimes controversial choices for peace and literature, physics often makes the biggest splash among the prizes, with the list of past winners featuring scientific superstars such as Albert Einstein, Niels Bohr and Enrico Fermi.</p>

<p>Last year's physics prize was awarded to Pierre Agostini, Ferenc Krausz and Anne L'Huillier for their work in creating ultra-short pulses of light that can give a snapshot of changes within atoms, potentially improving the detection of diseases.</p>

<p>Physics is the second Nobel to be awarded this week, after U.S. scientists Victor Ambros and Gary Ruvkun won the medicine prize for their discovery of microRNA and its role in gene regulation, shedding light on how cells specialise.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last month was the second-warmest September ever registered globally in an exceptional year "almost certain" to become the hottest on record, the EU climate monitor Copernicus said on Tuesday.</p>

<p>The Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) said the average global temperature last month was second only to September 2023.&nbsp;</p>

<p>September saw "extreme" rainfall and destructive storms in many parts of the world, events that are occurring with greater severity and frequency as global temperatures rise due to climate change.</p>

<p>Warmer air can hold more water vapour, and warmer oceans mean greater evaporation, resulting in more intense rainfall.</p>

<p>Hurricane Helene pounded the southeast United States, Typhoon Krathon slammed into Taiwan and Storm Boris brought floods and devastation to central Europe in a month of wild weather.</p>

<p>"The extreme rainfall events of this month, something we are observing more and more often, have been made worse by a warmer atmosphere, leading to more intense rainfall with months' worth of rain falling in just a few days," said Samantha Burgess, Deputy Director of the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S).</p>

<p>2023 was the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/worlds-hottest-day-record-broken-in-24-hours-says-climate-watchdog-6179974">warmest year</a> ever recorded but the months January through to September 2024 have set fresh highs, said Copernicus.</p>

<p>The monitor said it was "almost certain that 2024 is going to be the warmest year on record".</p>

<p>Copernicus records go back to 1940 but other sources of climate data such as ice cores, tree rings and coral skeletons allow scientists to expand their conclusions using evidence from much further in the past.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

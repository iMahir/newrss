       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hollywood star George Clooney has heaped praise on US President Joe Biden over the latter's decision to step down from the 2024 presidential race.</p>

<p>The actor attended the press event in Venice for his film 'Wolfs', and shared his opinion on Biden passing the baton to the current Vice President of the United States, Kamala Harris, reports Variety.</p>

<p>He said: "I've actually never had to answer that question so I suppose I will do it here. The person who should be applauded is the President, who has done the most selfless thing a President has done since George Washington."</p>

<p>"What should be remembered is the selfless act of someone who, it's very hard to let go of power - we know that we've seen it all over the world - and for someone to say I think there's a better path forward, all the credit goes to him. And that's really the truth ... I'm just very proud of where we are in the state of the world right now," he added.</p>

<p>During the event, he was also asked about Apple moving the film from a wide theatrical release to a limited one. He also brought up a New York Times report from last week by Nicole Sterling that he and Pitt were paid more than $35 million each.</p>

<p>"It was millions and millions of dollars less than what was reported," he said. "I think it's bad for our industry to have that be the standard."</p>

<p>As per Variety, on the changing state of the industry and moviegoing, he said that streaming is an absolute necessity.</p>

<p>"We need it. Our industry needs this. And (streamers) also benefit from having films released," he said. "But we haven't got it all figured out yet. This is a revolution in our industry. We need Apple and Amazon and they actually need distributors. They need to have Sony or Warner Bros, who have been doing this for 100 years."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The number of people in England with food allergies has more than doubled between 2008 and 2018, a new study reveals.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="theconversation-article-title">The number of people in England with food allergies has more than doubled between 2008 and 2018, a <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(24)00163-4/fulltext">new study</a> reveals. The researchers, from Imperial College London, found that rates are highest among preschool children, with 4% having a “probable” food allergy.</p>

<div class="theconversation-article-body">
<p>They also found that a third of those people at risk of anaphylaxis – a life-threatening allergic reaction – don't carry adrenaline autoinjector “pens”, such as EpiPens. People in deprived areas were found to be less likely to have been prescribed these life-saving injectors.</p>

<p>The true number of people with food allergies has been difficult to establish, with estimates varying between <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32067114/">under 1% and over 9% of children</a>. This is because several methods are used to estimate the frequency of food allergies, including using either the number of prescriptions of adrenaline pens, self-reporting, or blood tests to identify telltale antibodies.</p>

<p>Self-reporting is the least reliable method because many people confuse food intolerance with allergy, as is evident from a <a href="https://www.food.gov.uk/research/food-hypersensitivity/patterns-and-prevalence-of-adult-food-allergy">recent report</a> by the UK's Food Standards Agency.</p>

<p>Of the over 30% of adults who reported an adverse reaction to foods, only 6% were subsequently confirmed to have a true food allergy. To bridge this gap in understanding how common food allergies are, the new study from Imperial College took a much broader approach to better estimate the incidence of food allergy.</p>

<p>Population healthcare data from over 7.5 million people in England and a combination of clinical criteria were used to identify people with food allergies in these health records.</p>

<p>People were considered to have an allergy if doctors indicated they had either had a possible or probable allergy or if they had been prescribed an adrenaline pen or both. Using this combination, the number of people with food allergies was shown to have doubled in a decade. Curiously, since 2018, levels have plateaued somewhat at around 4% in preschool children, 2.4% in school-aged children, and under 1% in adults.</p>

<p>The study, published in The Lancet Public Health, used a broad range of criteria to identify people with food allergies. Not all cases were confirmed by medical professionals using additional tests, such as the presence of antibodies in blood or food-challenge tests where people are given increasing amounts of certain foods to see if an allergic reaction occurs.</p>

<p>Some types of food allergy may have been missed, such as <a href="https://www.allergyuk.org/resources/oral-allergy-syndrome-pollen-food-syndrome-factsheet/">pollen food allergy syndrome</a>. This occurs when people with specific pollen allergies eat some raw foods, including certain stoned fruits, that cause mild irritant symptoms, such as itching of the mouth. Still, there are important questions as to why food allergies have been rising, and why they may now be plateauing.</p>

<h3><strong>Puzzling</strong></h3>

<p>The trend in the increased rate of allergies in developed countries has puzzled scientists for years. The <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15007629/">“old friend's hypothesis”</a> is one theory that may account for the growing incidence of chronic conditions such as allergies.</p>

<p>This hypothesis considers the role of the microbiome (the collection of helpful bacteria, fungi and viruses that live in and on us), infections and the environment in shaping our immune response and causing it to misfire.</p>

<p>Evidence to support this theory is accumulating. For example, studies show that <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29105784/#:%7E:text=Early%2Dlife%20exposure%20to%20antibiotics,%3B%20I2%20%3A%2077.0%25.">high use of antibiotics</a> in early childhood as the immune system and microbiome are developing is linked to a greater likelihood of allergy in later life.</p>

<p>Pollution exposure can also enhance the risk of allergy and <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36810617/">worsen the severity of symptoms</a>.</p>

<p>The food we were exposed to in early life may be important in determining if we develop an allergy. <a href="https://www.food.gov.uk/research/food-allergy-and-intolerance-research/testing-of-government-advice-on-peanut-consumption-during-early-life">Previous advice</a> from the UK government about avoiding early exposure to peanuts and eggs may inadvertently be linked to the rise in food allergy to peanuts and eggs.</p>

<p>Conversely, <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1414850">studies show</a> that early exposure before the age of five to <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26943128/">peanuts and eggs</a> is <a href="https://evidence.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/EVIDoa2300311">linked to</a> a reduced likelihood of developing an allergy.</p>

<p>The advice in the UK to avoid peanuts and eggs during pregnancy and early childhood was changed in <a href="https://www.food.gov.uk/research/food-allergy-and-intolerance-research/testing-of-government-advice-on-peanut-consumption-during-early-life">2009</a>, but the trials showing the positive effects of early exposure to eggs and peanuts were only published in 2015 and 2016. However, it is possible that the plateauing incidence of food allergy cases is linked to changes in advice and the published infant food exposure trials.</p>

<p>Diagnosis is only part of the story. People also need to be able to effectively manage their condition. This requires patients to have access to the right advice and support from experts, such as dietitians, as well as the drugs needed to halt an anaphylactic attack.</p>

<p>For babies diagnosed with a food allergy, there is no <a href="https://journals.lww.com/co-clinicalnutrition/fulltext/2014/05000/Food_allergy_in_children__what_is_new_.15.aspx">good evidence</a>&nbsp;that incrementally reintroducing the food that causes the allergy can retrain the immune system and might help the child overcome their allergy. However, this must only be done under the guidance of a medical team.</p>

<p>The new study showed that allergy care was largely managed at GP practices in England. However, GP clinics may lack the specialist resources needed for proper allergy support, such as safely re-introducing foods.</p>

<p>It is clear that people in the UK with allergies need better support.<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.

       <description><![CDATA[A California grandmother died  after a suicidal man jumped from a highway overpass onto the windshield of her car.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A California grandmother died after a suicidal man jumped from a highway overpass onto the windshield of her car. The incident occurred on August 9 when Margarita Novela Galindo and her husband, Florencio, were on the 210 Freeway near Sylmar, heading for a weekend getaway, reported ABC.</p>

<p>The Los Angeles Fire Department received a call about a man threatening to jump from the Roxford Street overpass around 7 pm, according to a KABC report. Shortly after, the man followed through with his threat, plunging into the path of the Galindos' vehicle.</p>

<p>The impact was severe. The man crashed through the windshield, landing directly on Ms Margarita, who was seated in the passenger seat. Her husband, who was driving the car, escaped without serious injuries.</p>

<p>The grandmother-of-seven died on August 28 after spending nearly three weeks in critical condition.</p>

<p>Ms Margarita's death has left her family devastated. "It's incredibly unfair that her life was taken because someone else didn't want theirs," her son David Galindo wrote on a <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/8e5ke-support-for-a-loving-mothers-farewell?utm_campaign=fp_sharesheet_ai&amp;utm_content=amp9v2&amp;utm_medium=customer&amp;utm_source=copy_link ">GoFundMe</a> page set up to help with medical expenses and funeral costs.</p>

<p>The family is now grappling with the "what ifs" of the tragic accident, wondering if a slight delay or detour could have changed the outcome. "What if she stopped to get gas? What if she stopped to get water? This probably wouldn't have happened," David told <a href="https://abc7.com/post/woman-dies-after-man-jumps-off-210-freeway-sylmar-lands-vehicle/15250346/">ABC7</a>.</p>

<p>He said that his father is “now alone without the love of his life.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Florencio Galindo harbours no ill will for the man whose actions led to his wife's death. "He doesn't know what problems he may have had to commit suicide," his daughter Stephanie translated her father's words from Spanish.&nbsp;</p><p><div class='table-div suicide'><table class='table'><thead><tr><th colspan='2'>Helplines</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Vandrevala Foundation for Mental Health</td><td><a href='tel:+919999666555'>9999666555</a> or <a href='mailto:help@vandrevalafoundation.com'>help@vandrevalafoundation.com</a> </td></tr><tr><td>TISS iCall</td><td><a href='tel:+912225521111'>022-25521111</a> (Monday-Saturday: 8 am to 10 pm)</td></tr> <tr><td colspan='2'>(If you need support or know someone who does, please reach out to your nearest mental health specialist.)</td></tr></tbody></table></div></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you've been wondering why you see only a certain kind of content on your X feed, its owner Elon Musk has the answer. The billionaire, in a post on Monday, shed light on the platform's inner workings.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The X algorithm operates on a simple yet effective principle: "If you interact with content, you want to see more of that content." This means your engagement such as likes, comments, and shares with posts directly influences the algorithm's decisions on what content to display.<br />
<br />
Mr Musk elaborated on one of the algorithm's key signals – sharing content. "One of the strongest signals is if you forward X posts to friends, it assumes you like that content a lot because it takes effort to forward," he wrote. This means that when users share a post, the algorithm interprets that action as a strong endorsement of the content, pushing similar items into their feed frequently.<br />
<br />
However, Mr Musk also acknowledged a significant flaw in this logic. He pointed out that the algorithm does not understand the intent behind a user's interaction, particularly when the motivation is negative. "Unfortunately, if the actual reason you forwarded the content to friends was because you were outraged by it, we are currently not smart enough to realise that," he admitted.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>In a follow-up post, Mr Musk shared his support for “freedom of speech”. “I like content that supports freedom of speech,” he declared, adding, “Long live X. Long live freedom of speech.”</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none">

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Going a step further, he wrote, “I'll cage fight the dictator in Brazil if I have to.” This remark was aimed at Brazil's Chief Justice Alexandre de Moraes, whom Mr Musk has previously labelled a “tyrant” and a “dictator.”&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The feud between the two began in April when Elon Musk announced he would unsuspend accounts linked to the 2023 Brazilian Congress attack in Brasilia, despite a court order to keep them blocked.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
In response, Alexandre de Moraes opened an investigation into the X owner, accusing him of spreading fake news, obstructing justice and inciting criminal activities. He also ordered Brazilian internet service providers to block access to X, threatened daily fines for users trying to bypass the ban by using VPNs, and even froze the finances of Mr Musk's company, Starlink, in Brazil.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Elon Musk fired back by accusing Mr Moraes of undermining democracy and has used X to criticise the judge's actions.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Malaysia Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim and his New Zealand counterpart Chris Luxon on Monday said they were united in calling for an immediate ceasefire in the conflict in Gaza and finding a two-state solution between Israel and Palestine. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We both are very united in calling for an immediate ceasefire, getting the parties around the negotiating table and finding a two-state solution," Luxon said at a joint press conference. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Anwar said prospects for a ceasefire did not look encouraging at present, saying there was a lack of commitment from countries, particularly the United States, who could exert their influence to stop the conflict.</p>

<p>"The only hope is to engage the United States to take a stronger stance," Anwar said.</p>

<p>Muslim-majority Malaysia is a staunch supporter of the Palestinian cause and has long advocated a two-state solution to the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.</p>

<p>Anwar has good relations with the political leadership of the Palestinian group Hamas but maintains he has no involvement in its military apparatus.</p>

<p>Luxon, who is on a three-day visit to Malaysia, also said New Zealand would expand defence cooperation with Malaysia and was deploying one of its air force's P8 Poseidon patrol and reconnaissance aircraft to Butterworth in Malaysia's northern Penang state, for a joint exercise.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>South Korean police have launched an investigation into the messaging platform Telegram over deepfake online sex crimes, Yonhap news agency reported on Monday, citing a senior police official.</p>

<p>The probe will examine whether it had been abetting the distribution of sexually explicit deepfake content, Yonhap said, quoting the head of the National Office of Investigation.</p>

<p>An official at the National Police Agency's cyber investigation bureau declined to confirm the report when reached by telephone.</p>

<p>South Korean authorities have called on Telegram and other social media platforms for cooperation in fighting sexually explicit deepfake content.</p>

<p>The steps follow reports by several domestic media outlets that sexually explicit deepfake images and videos of South Korean women were often found in Telegram chatrooms.</p>

<p>Telegram could not immediately be reached for comment but the company last week said it actively moderates harmful content on its platform including illegal pornography.</p>

<p>"Moderators use a combination of proactive monitoring of public parts of the platform, sophisticated AI tools and user reports in order to remove millions of pieces of harmful content each day," it said in a statement.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The West is openly persecuting Russian journalists, President Vladimir Putin said in remarks published on Monday, days after Moscow banned dozens of US journalists from entering the country.</p>

<p>"In order to hide from inconvenient facts, from truthful information, the West, which considers itself the standard of freedom, has launched an open persecution against Russian correspondents," Putin told the Mongolian newspaper Onoodor on the eve of his visit to the country, according to a transcript provided on the Kremlin's website.</p>

<p>His remarks come after Moscow said on Wednesday it was banning entry to Russia for 92 US citizens, including journalists, lawyers, and the heads of what it said were key military-industrial firms, over what it described as Washington's Russophobic stance.</p>

<p>They also follow years of the Kremlin's suppression of independent media and Moscow's swift blocking of dissenting voices in Russian-language media outlets at the start of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022.</p>

<p>Putin said that in Russia, media are free.</p>

<p>"The only requirement for them is compliance with Russian legislation," he said. "Foreign correspondents accredited in our country should understand this."</p>

<p>Russia has frequently accused Western countries of imposing unfair restrictions on its media abroad, including bans on some state-backed news outlets.</p>

<p>Putin told the Mongolian newspaper that Russian journalists face "direct censorship" in almost all Western countries.</p>

<p>"The only thing our media do is to convincingly convey the Russian point of view on current modern problems and processes taking place in the world," Putin said.</p>

<p>In May, Russian lawmakers passed a bill giving prosecutors powers to shut foreign media bureaus in Moscow if a Western country has been "unfriendly" to Russian media.</p>

<p>Washington has imposed sanctions against some state-run Russian TV stations, which it says have spread disinformation to bolster Russia's war in Ukraine.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As Kamala Harris heads into the November presidential race against Donald Trump, a social club she joined in college four decades ago might just pay its biggest dividends yet.</p>

<p>"Whatever it is that she needs our coalitions to do, we're going to be there to help push it out and get it done," said Tanya Baham, a member of Harris's college sorority, in attendance at the recent Democratic National Convention.</p>

<p>Sororities and fraternities abound across US college campuses -- with their Greek-letter names, exclusive memberships, and promise of community, usually along same-sex lines.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But Harris's membership in Alpha Kappa Alpha, a historically Black sorority, provides her campaign a direct line to a network of 360,000 women across the country, many of whom are excited to see one of their own in the White House.</p>

<p>And the Democratic Party, which counts women and Black voters as key constituencies in their electoral base, is paying attention.</p>

<p>While the sorority itself is non-partisan, many, like Baham, are ready to individually tap their networks for fundraising and voter registration in an election that could come down to the wire.</p>

<p>"We're... going to make certain that our kiddos, the young folks, the old folks, get a chance to register and then get to the polls," said Baham, a social worker in Louisiana.</p>

<h3><strong>Built-in network</strong></h3>

<p>Harris joined AKA at Howard University, a historically Black school in Washington where the sorority was founded in 1908 -- the first such organization for Black undergraduate women in the United States.</p>

<p>Over the next few decades, more Black sororities and fraternities emerged, providing African American students refuge amid the scourge of American racism and also serving as bases for civil rights organizing.</p>

<p>AKA has chapters for both undergraduate students and college graduates, making it far more than just a college-level organization.</p>

<p>As vice president, Harris has hosted Black sorority and fraternity leaders at the White House, and ahead of rising to the top of the Democratic ticket she headlined AKA's convention in Texas, in July.</p>

<p>Later that month, within days of President Joe Biden ending his reelection bid, she was at a convention for another Black sorority, Zeta Phi Beta, in Indiana.</p>

<p>AKA members were among those on a "Win With Black Women" Zoom call which raised $1.5 million, and Glenda Glover, the sorority's former president, is leading outreach for Harris at the country's historically Black colleges.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a historic first, AKA has also formed a political action committee, used for fundraising for political candidates.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We're just all ready to work and do this," Donna Miller, a county official in Illinois who was on the Zoom call, told the Chicago Sun-Times. "It invigorated so many people from young and old, across generations, across ethnicity."</p>

<h3><strong>Tight-lipped&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>But while AKA and other Black sororities provide a network for Harris to tap into, it is hard to gauge how much that will translate into actual votes come November.</p>

<p>The sorority and its members have generally been tight-lipped -- multiple members declined to speak with AFP about the election.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Some referred AFP to the sorority's headquarters, which did not respond to multiple requests for comment. A half dozen individual chapters also did not respond to requests for comment.</p>

<p>"Mobilization through sororities can't hurt," said Daniel Hopkins, a political scientist at the University of Pennsylvania.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But Hopkins cautioned that "there are only so many voters in the US in general who attend four-year colleges, who are members of these organizations."</p>

<p>And while African Americans are overwhelmingly Democratic voters, they have been peeling off from the party in recent years -- a decline that has mostly come from younger and infrequent voters, according to his research.</p>

<p>At the same time, Amanda Wilkerson, an assistant professor of higher education at the University of Central Florida who has studied Black voters, said organizations like Black sororities and fraternities are "hidden apparatuses," often ignored by polling or the media even as they've organized for previous elections, both nationally and locally.</p>

<p>Their members and alumni are well-versed in campaigning, she said, and the 2024 election isn't their first go-around.</p>

<p>Harris "is the first candidate of her kind to be able to leverage those networks of support," Wilkerson said. "But it's not altogether new.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A five-member panel of Brazil's Supreme Court will vote on Monday on whether to uphold Justice Alexandre de Moraes' ruling to shut down social media platform X in the country.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A five-member panel of Brazil's Supreme Court will vote on Monday on whether to uphold Justice Alexandre de Moraes' ruling to shut down social media platform X in the country.</p>

<p>Moraes, whom X owner Elon Musk has labelled a "dictator," has called a virtual session of the court's first chamber - of which he is a member - so peers can review his decision.</p>

<p>Brazil's Supreme Court has 11 justices split between two chambers of five members each, not including the chief justice. They can vote to maintain or reject decisions by a single judge.</p>

<p>Justices Carmen Lucia, Luiz Fux, Cristiano Zanin and Flavio Dino sit in the first chamber alongside Moraes.</p>

<p>X was taken down in Brazil, one of its largest markets, in the early hours of Saturday following a decision by Moraes, who has been locked in a months-long feud with Musk.</p>

<p>The popular social media platform missed a court-imposed deadline on Thursday evening to name a legal representative in Brazil as required by local law, triggering the suspension.</p>

<p>The dispute over X has its roots in a Moraes order earlier this year that required the platform to block accounts implicated in probes of alleged misinformation and hate.</p>

<p>Musk has argued that Moraes was trying to enforce unjustified censorship and closed the X office in Brazil in August, without appointing a new representative. The judge has insisted that social media needs hate speech regulations.</p>

<p>Moraes' latest decision was backed by Chief Justice Luis Roberto Barroso.</p>

<p>"A company that refuses to name a legal representative in Brazil cannot operate in Brazilian territory," Barroso said in an interview with the newspaper Folha de S.Paulo published on Sunday.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The highly-anticipated grand opening of Pakistan's Dream Bazaar Mall in Karachi descended into chaos when a group of people forcibly entered the venue, causing widespread vandalism and destruction of property.&nbsp;The mall, built by a Pakistani businessman living abroad, was heavily publicised on social media and offered special discounts to attract customers on its opening day,&nbsp;<em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://arynews.tv/karachi-dream-bazaar-opening-sale-chaos/" rel="nofollow, noindex">ARY News</a></em> reported. However, shortly after opening its doors at 3:00 pm, the mall was overwhelmed by a massive crowd,&nbsp;eager to enter the store.</p>

<p>Videos circulating on social media show hundreds of people storming into the newly opened mall in Karachi's Gulistan-e-Johar area, as they vandalise property and loot stores.&nbsp;Despite desperate attempts by the staff to manage the crowd and maintain order, people forcefully barged into the shop, damaging shops and stealing merchandise. People frantically grabbed whatever they could lay their hands on, shoving them into bags or carrying them away in their arms.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Eyewitnesses reported that despite the commotion, police were notably absent from the scene.</p>

<p><strong>Watch the videos here:</strong></p>

<p>Many videos also captured the aftermath of the rampage, revealing a scene of utter devastation. The entire building was left in shambles, with clothes scattered all over the floor, and shattered glass littering the premises. The footage showed people filming themselves as they looted the store, seemingly proud of their actions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The video sparked a heated debate, with users expressing shock, and disgust at the scenes of chaos and destruction.&nbsp;Several internet users expressed their disappointment at the lack of civic morals displayed by the crowd, with many questioning how individuals could resort to such destructive behaviour.</p>

<p>One user wrote. ''What else can you expect from a country where lawlessness is the norm? A place where even a generous gesture turns into chaos. This incident speaks volumes about the state of affairs in Pakistan.''</p>

<p>Another commented, ''Tell me what's missing here? I think basic cultural education!! When someone is trying to do good for you, be thankful! Not loot them instead.'' A third said, ''It's unfortunate to see such an exciting development turn into a chaotic situation. While the intention behind offering special discounts to locals was admirable, it's clear that better planning and security measures were needed to prevent the mall from being looted.''</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger and key executives are expected to present a plan later this month to the company's board of directors to slice off unnecessary businesses and revamp capital spending.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger and key executives are expected to present a plan later this month to the company's board of directors to slice off unnecessary businesses and revamp capital spending, according to a source familiar with the matter, as they try to revive the once-dominant chipmaker's fortunes.</p>

<p>The plan will include ideas on how to shave overall costs by selling businesses, including its programmable chip unit Altera, that Intel can no longer afford to fund from the company's once-sizeable profit.</p>

<p>Gelsinger and other high-ranking executives at Intel are expected to present the plan at a mid-September board meeting, the same source said.</p>

<p>Details of Gelsinger's proposal are reported here for the first time.</p>

<p>Intel declined to comment.</p>

<p>The proposal does not yet include plans to split Intel and sell off its contract manufacturing operation, or foundry, to a buyer such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., according to the source and another person familiar with the matter.</p>

<p>The presentation, including the plans around its manufacturing operations, is not yet finalized and could change ahead of the meeting.</p>

<p>Intel has already broken off its foundry business from its design business, and has been reporting its financial results separately since the first calendar quarter of this year.</p>

<p>The company has erected a wall between the design and manufacturing businesses to assure that potential customers of the design division would have no access to the technology secrets of customers using Intel's factories, known as fabs, to manufacture their chips.</p>

<p>Intel is suffering through one of its worst periods as it attempts to play catchup in the AI era against the likes of Nvidia, the dominant AI chipmaker with a $3 trillion market capitalization. In contrast, Intel has now sunk to below $100 billion after a disastrous second-quarter earnings report in August.</p>

<p>The proposal Gelsinger and others will present is likely to include plans to further reduce the company's capital spending on factory expansion. The pitch may include plans to pause or altogether halt its $32 billion factory in Germany, a project that has reportedly been delayed, the source said.</p>

<p>In August, Intel said it expects to cut capital spending to $21.5 billion in 2025, down 17% from this year, and issued a weaker-than-expected third-quarter forecast.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In addition to the CEO and executive plans, Intel has retained Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs to advise the board on what businesses Intel can sell and what it needs to retain, according to two sources with knowledge of the company's advisory plans.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Intel has not yet asked for bids on the product units, but will likely do so once the board endorses a plan, according to the two sources familiar with the company's advisory plans.</p>

<h3><strong>ALTERA SPIN-OUT</strong></h3>

<p>The mid-September board meeting is pivotal for the one-time chipmaking king. Intel reported a disastrous second quarter in August, which included pausing the company's dividend payments and a 15% staff cut, aimed at saving $10 billion.</p>

<p>Weeks later, chip industry veteran Lip-Bu Tan resigned from the board after months of debate over the company's future, Reuters reported, creating a vacuum of deep semiconductor business experience on the board.</p>

<p>Last Thursday, after the Reuters report, Gelsinger sought to reassure investors about the company's weak financial performance.</p>

<p>"It's been a difficult few weeks," Gelsinger said at a Deutsche Bank conference. "And we've been working hard to address the issues."</p>

<p>Gelsinger said the company is "taking seriously" what investors have said and that Intel is focused on phase two of the company's turnaround plan.</p>

<p>Part of those plans will remain unresolved until the mid-September meeting. Then, the company's directors will likely make crucial decisions about which businesses Intel will keep and which it will shed.</p>

<p>One potential unit the company may look to unload is its programmable chip business, Altera, which Intel acquired for $16.7 billion in 2015. Intel has already taken steps to spin it out as a separate but still wholly owned subsidiary and has said it planned to sell a portion of its stake in an initial public offering in the future, though it has not set a date.</p>

<p>But Altera could also be sold entirely to another chipmaker interested in growing its portfolio, and the company has quietly begun exploring whether a sale would be possible, according to one source familiar with its advisory plans and one of the sources familiar with the plans to cut businesses.</p>

<p>Infrastructure chipmaker Marvell is one potential buyer for such a transaction, according to one of the sources.</p>

<p>Bloomberg earlier reported various options for Intel including a potential split of Intel's product design and manufacturing businesses that is expected to be discussed at the board meeting.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The head of the Christian political party Lebanese Forces on Sunday accused Hezbollah of dragging the country into a war with Israel without consulting the people.</p>

<p>In a speech attacking the Shiite Muslim group, Samir Geagea, who heads the main Christian bloc in parliament, accused Hezbollah of "confiscating the Lebanese people's decision on war and peace, as if there were no state".</p>

<p>Since the start of the war between Israel and Hamas in October, Hezbollah has engaged in near-daily cross-border fire with Israel in support of its Palestinian ally, which the Lebanese Forces and other parties oppose.</p>

<p>The clashes are "a war that the Lebanese people reject, but has been imposed on them", Geagea said in a speech to supporters north of Beirut.</p>

<p>"It is a war that the Lebanese people do not want and over which the government has had no say. This war does not serve Lebanon, it has brought nothing to Gaza, nor alleviated its suffering one iota," he added.</p>

<p>Iran-backed Hezbollah was the only Lebanese faction that did not disarm after the 1975-1990 civil war.</p>

<p>Its arsenal, reputed to be significantly larger than that of the Lebanese army, is touted by its supporters as a shield against Israel.</p>

<p>The movement's critics call Hezbollah a "state within a state".</p>

<p>"This war, in which Hezbollah is engaged, must stop before it brings about a major war that will spare no one," Geagea said.</p>

<p>He called on the government to "urge" Hezbollah to stop its fight with Israel.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Lebanon is without a president and the caretaker government is struggling to run a country gripped by a crippling financial crisis.</p>

<p>Tensions on the border appeared to have cooled since a major escalation last month. Analysts say both parties are showing restraint to avoid a regional escalation.</p>

<p>In the latest incident, one person was killed and 11 wounded in Israeli strikes on south Lebanon Sunday, the health ministry in Beirut said.</p>

<p>Hezbollah announced that one of its fighters had been killed by Israeli fire.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The violence since October has killed some 607 people in Lebanon, mostly Hezbollah fighters but including at least 132 civilians, according to an AFP tally.</p>

<p>On the Israeli side including in the annexed Golan Heights, authorities have announced the deaths of at least 24 soldiers and 26 civilians.</p>

<p>Tens of thousands of people remain displaced on both sides.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The families of Israeli hostages whose bodies were recovered from Gaza sobbed as they laid their relatives to rest on Sunday at funerals that featured heartfelt eulogies alongside expressions of frustration with the government.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Almog, my dear son, how much hope we had, how much we prayed that we would get the chance to see you again, to hug you, to enjoy your smile," Almog Sarusi's mother Nira said at the lectern during her son's funeral in the city of Raanana in central Israel.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"But on October 7 you were neglected," she added, referring to the day Hamas militants attacked southern Israel, seizing her son from the Nova music festival along with 250 other hostages.&nbsp;</p>

<p>She went on to describe "ongoing neglect, every day, every hour, 331 days... You were sacrificed to 'destroy Hamas'."&nbsp;</p>

<p>The October 7 attack resulted in the deaths of 1,205 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures.&nbsp;</p>

<p>That count includes Almog Sarusi and five other hostages recovered from a Gaza tunnel on Saturday.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Israeli authorities confirmed their identities on Sunday. The health ministry said they were shot at close range shortly before soldiers found them.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory military campaign to destroy Hamas has killed 40,738 people, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The UN says the majority of the dead in Gaza are women and children.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>'Enough'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>The identification of six new dead hostages on Sunday elicited fresh anger from critics of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who accuse him of not working hard enough to secure a ceasefire deal that would lead to the release of those still being held captive.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Tens of thousands of Israelis took to the streets across the country on Sunday afternoon and evening.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In Jerusalem, protesters holding Israeli flags and signs bearing the faces of hostages shouted "Where are you?!" into loudspeakers directed at the government office building where a cabinet meeting was set to take place.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We don't know who will be the next family that will get the terrible call," said Eyal Kalderon, cousin of French-Israeli hostage Ofer Kalderon who is still captive.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Of course, it was six young and beautiful people today, and it can be any of the others in the future."&nbsp;</p>

<p>The crowds at funerals and memorial services on Sunday were more subdued.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In Petah Tikva, friends and family of Eden Yerushalmi, whose death was also confirmed on Sunday, cried and caressed her body which was wrapped in a blue-and-white Israeli flag.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In Jerusalem, hundreds of people gathered at a community centre near the synagogue where the family of US-Israeli Hersh Goldberg-Polin, whose death was also announced on Sunday, worships.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Candles were lit in front of signs in Hebrew and English that read "Bring Hersh Home", and many in attendance wept openly as the names of other hostages were read out.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Goldberg-Polin's funeral will take place on Monday in Jerusalem.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Back in Raanana, Nira Sarusi told mourners she hoped no other families would have to go through similar ceremonies.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Enough, no more. We paid the worst price. I hope that we will be the last ones. From now on, only a deal to bring all the hostages back."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gaza health officials said an Israeli air strike targeting a group of policemen in a school sheltering displaced Palestinians killed at least 11 people on Sunday, while the military said it had struck a Hamas command centre.</p>

<p>"Eleven people, including a woman and girl, were killed when an Israeli air strike struck the Safad school in Gaza City sheltering displaced people," civil defence agency spokesman Mahmud Bassal told AFP, adding several people were also wounded.</p>

<p>The school had a Hamas police outpost, another Gaza health official said on condition of anonymity.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said its air force had struck a Hamas command centre in the Safad school.</p>

<p>"The IAF struck Hamas terrorists who were operating within a command and control centre embedded inside the area that previously served as the Safad school in Gaza City," the military said in a statement.</p>

<p>The war between Israel and Hamas erupted after Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, which resulted in the deaths of 1,205 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.</p>

<p>Since then, the Israeli military has been relentlessly bombing the Gaza Strip from the air, sea and ground, which has so far killed at least 40,738 people, according to the territory's health ministry.</p>

<p>According to the UN, the majority of the dead are women and children.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At least 47 people, including five children, were injured on Sunday after Russian missiles struck a shopping mall and events complex in Ukraine's northeastern city of Kharkiv, officials said.</p>

<p>Earlier in the day, Russia said Kyiv had launched one of the biggest drone attacks against it since the full-scale war began, targeting power plants and an oil refinery, while Moscow's forces made further gains towards a key town in eastern Ukraine.</p>

<p>The Kharkiv attack prompted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to renew calls on allies to allow Kyiv to fire Western-supplied missiles deeper into enemy territory and reduce the military threat posed by Russia.</p>

<p>The fighting comes at a critical juncture in the two-and-a-half year conflict. Russia is pressing an offensive in eastern Ukraine while trying to expel Ukrainian forces that broke through its western border in a surprise incursion on Aug. 6.</p>

<p>Last week, Russia pounded Ukraine with its heaviest airstrikes of the war, hitting targets including energy facilities.</p>

<p>Moscow, which denies targeting civilians, says damaging Ukraine's energy system is a legitimate military goal. Its drone and missile barrages have killed thousands of civilians since the conflict began in February 2022.</p>

<p>Ukraine, with a rapidly expanding domestic drone industry, has stepped up its own attacks on Russian energy, military and transport infrastructure.</p>

<p>Kyiv is also pressing the United States and other allies for permission to use more powerful Western-supplied weapons to inflict greater damage inside Russia and hit Moscow's abilities to attack Ukraine.</p>

<p>"All the necessary forces of the world must be brought in to stop this terror," Zelenskiy said on his Telegram channel, in response to the Kharkiv attack that Ukrainian officials said involved at least 10 missiles.</p>

<p>"This does not require extraordinary forces, but enough courage on the part of the leaders - courage to give Ukraine what it needs to defend itself."</p>

<p>In Kharkiv, rescue workers and volunteers carried injured civilians to ambulances outside the shopping complex. Shattered glass and debris were strewn across the ground and people fled to a metro station for safety.</p>

<p>Earlier, Russian officials said air defence units had destroyed 158 drones launched by Ukraine overnight, and that debris caused fires at the Moscow Oil Refinery and at the Konakovo Power Station in the neighbouring Tver region.</p>

<p>Kyiv has yet to comment on the drone barrage. Russia rarely discloses the full extent of damage inflicted by Ukraine's air attacks.</p>

<h3><strong>Russia's Nuclear Doctrine</strong></h3>

<p>Zelenskiy said that last week alone Russia had used 160 missiles, 780 guided aerial bombs and 400 attack drones against cities and troops across Ukraine.</p>

<p>He called on Telegram for "a decision on long-range strikes on missile launch sites from Russia, destruction of Russian military logistics, joint shooting down of missiles and drones".</p>

<p>Kyiv's allies are wary of how Russian President Vladimir Putin would respond if their weapons were used against targets far inside Russian territory.</p>

<p>Russia's TASS state news agency cited Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov as saying Moscow would change its nuclear doctrine in response to the West's actions over the conflict. He did not specify what the changes would entail.</p>

<p>Russia's existing nuclear doctrine, set out in a decree by President Vladimir Putin in 2020, says it may use nuclear weapons in the event of a nuclear attack by an enemy or a conventional attack that threatens the existence of the state.</p>

<p>Russia, which accuses the West of using Ukraine as a proxy to wage war against it, has said before it is considering changes.</p>

<p>"The work is at an advanced stage, and there is a clear intent to make corrections", TASS cited Ryabkov as saying.</p>

<p>Some hawks among Russia's military analysts have urged Putin to lower the threshold for nuclear use in order to "sober up" Russia's enemies in the West.</p>

<h3><strong>Advances In Eastern Ukraine</strong></h3>

<p>In eastern Ukraine, where the heaviest fighting of the war is concentrated, Russian forces continued to advance towards Pokrovsk, a vital military hub and transport link to towns and cities further north.</p>

<p>Ukraine had hoped that its surprise incursion into Russia's Kursk region launched last month would force Russia to re-deploy troops and take pressure off besieged forces in the east, but so far it does not appear to have had this effect.</p>

<p>Russia's defence ministry said its forces had captured two more settlements in Donetsk region and were "continuing to advance deep into the enemy defences". One of them, Ptyche, is 21 km (13 miles) southeast of Pokrovsk.</p>

<p>At least three people were killed and nine wounded in Russian shelling of Kurakhove, a town around 35 km south of Pokrovsk, Ukrainian officials said.</p>

<p>Ukraine's army chief, Oleksandr Syrskyi, described the situation as "difficult" around Russia's main line of attack in eastern Ukraine.</p>

<p>Also on Sunday, Ukrainian forces shelled Russia's southern Belgorod region, injuring 11 people, including two children who were seriously hurt, regional governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Russia said Sunday it had repelled a "massive" Ukrainian drone attack on energy and fuel plants in Moscow and 14 regions, one of the largest such strikes since the start of the two and half-year conflict.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russia said Sunday it had repelled a "massive" Ukrainian drone attack on energy and fuel plants in Moscow and 14 regions, one of the largest such strikes since the start of the two and half-year conflict.</p>

<p>Ukraine has repeatedly sent drones to strike Russia's energy infrastructure in recent months, in retaliation for Moscow's missile attacks that have hugely damaged its own energy network since the Kremlin first sent troops into the country in February 2022.</p>

<p>"It is entirely justified for Ukrainians to respond to Russian terror by any means necessary to stop it," President Volodymyr Zelensky wrote on Facebook.</p>

<p>The latest barrage saw 158 drones fired, most of them downed over the regions of Kursk, Bryansk, Voronezh and Belgorod which border Ukraine, Russia's defence ministry said.</p>

<p>Moscow mayor Sergei Sobyanin said that 10 drones had targeted various areas in and around the capital.</p>

<p>One of them sparked a fire at an oil refinery within the city limits of the sprawling capital, he said, while a coal-fired power plant near the city was also reported to have been targeted.</p>

<p>The barrage came just days after Russia sent over 200 drones and missiles at Ukraine's energy infrastructure, in one of the largest such attacks.</p>

<p>It also comes nearly a month since Ukraine went on the offensive in Russia's Kursk region, crossing the border and capturing Russian territory as Russian troops continued their slow but steady advance in eastern Ukraine.</p>

<p>Sobyanin said Sunday morning that a downed drone had hit a "technical building" at the Moscow oil refinery, owned by the Gazprom energy giant, in the southeast Kapotnya area of the capital.</p>

<p>The mayor later said "the fire at the oil refinery has been localised and there is no threat to people or the plant's operation".</p>

<p>In the Tver region northwest of Moscow, five drones targeted the area of Konakovo power plant and caused a fire that was swiftly extinguished, according to governor Igor Rudenya.</p>

<h3><strong>'Most massive' attack</strong></h3>

<p>A local official in the Moscow region, Mikhail Shuvalov, said on Telegram that three drones had also tried to hit the Kashira coal-fired power station, but that "there were no victims nor damage and it did not catch fire".</p>

<p>Russian military blogger Rybar, who is followed by more than 1.3 million people, wrote, "the night attack by the Ukrainian armed forces was the most massive since the start of the special military operation" in 2022.</p>

<p>In the city of Belgorod and the surrounding area, governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said 11 were injured in a later Ukrainian attack on Sunday afternoon, among them two children and there was widescale damage to blocks of flats and houses.</p>

<p>In the Donetsk region, Russia is advancing towards the city of Pokrovsk and Ukraine's Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces Oleksandr Syrsky wrote on Facebook that the "situation is difficult in the direction of the enemy's main offensive".</p>

<p>At least three people were killed and nine injured by shelling of the Donetsk region near the town of Kurakhove, the regional governor Vadym Filashkin said.</p>

<p>Russia on Sunday claimed control of two new villages in the region: Ptyche near Pokrovsk and Vyyimka further northeast.</p>

<h3><strong>'Terrorising Kharkiv'</strong></h3>

<p>On Sunday afternoon, Russia struck Ukraine's second largest city of Kharkiv with missiles, injuring 47 people including seven children, according to the emergency services.</p>

<p>National police said Russia injuring 21 at a shopping centre and 18 at a sports centre, of whom five were children.</p>

<p>The attack caused "large-scale destruction and fires," the emergency service said and "people could be under the rubble".</p>

<p>An AFP photographer saw rescuers working in the rubble of the destroyed Sports Palace centre with a dog, looking for survivors and bringing out one of those injured on a stretcher.</p>

<p>Outside the shopping centre, there were burnt-out cars and facades torn off buildings and flames from a damaged gas pipe.</p>

<p>Prosecutors said Russia fired two Iskander-M ballistic missiles at a shopping centre and three at the Sports Palace while three other missiles hit near the sports centre.</p>

<p>The energy ministry said that Russia had attacked an energy facility in the city, without giving details.</p>

<p>Kharkiv also came under attack Friday with an aerial strike killing seven including a teenage girl.</p>

<p>"Russia is once again terrorising Kharkiv, striking civilian infrastructure and the city itself," Zelensky wrote on Facebook, appealing for more weapons to fend off attacks.</p>

<p>He urged global leaders to show the "courage to give Ukraine everything it needs to defend itself".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The number of fires in Brazil's Amazon rainforest region for the month of August surged to the highest level since 2010, government data showed on Sunday, after a record drought that has been plaguing the biome.</p>

<p>Last year's rains came late and were weaker than usual because a weather pattern, known as El Nino, was supercharged by climate change, leaving the rainforest especially vulnerable to this year's fires.</p>

<p>Satellites detected 38,266 fire hotspots in the Amazon in August, more than double compared to the previous year and the largest number for that month since 2010, data from Brazil's National Institute for Space Research (Inpe) showed.</p>

<p>The August data reaching a 14-year high comes after last month's fire hotspots in the region surged to a two-decade high.</p>

<p>While the data is the fastest indicator of the state of fires in the region, which often peak between August and September, it does not indicate the intensity.</p>

<p>Fires in the naturally wet and humid biome often start on cattle ranches where locals are converting the jungle into pastures for cattle ranching.</p>

<p>Warmer air and drier vegetation have created conditions where fires can spread more rapidly as well as burn more intensely and for longer. Deforestation has also reduced the rainforest's ability to produce rain and humidity.</p>

<p>Helga Correa, a conservation specialist at WWF-Brasil, said in an initial assessment of the August data last week that the fires were driven by a combination of weather, climate change and human actions.</p>

<p>"The region where we detected concentrated smoke in August coincides with the so-called Arch of Deforestation, which includes the north of Rondonia, the south of Amazonas and the southwest of Para," she said.</p>

<p>"This indicates that, in addition to climate change and El Nino, changes in land use produced by humans play a central role in the increase in fires," she said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iran's final investigation into the May helicopter crash that killed president Ebrahim Raisi has found it was caused by bad weather, the body investigating the case said Sunday.</p>

<p>The helicopter carrying 63-year-old Raisi and his entourage came down on a fog-shrouded mountainside in northern Iran, killing the president and seven others, and triggering snap elections.</p>

<p>The main cause of the helicopter crash was the "complex climatic and atmospheric conditions of the region in the spring", the special board investigating the dimensions and causes of the helicopter accident said, according to state broadcaster IRIB.</p>

<p>The report added that "the sudden emergence of a thick mass of dense and rising fog" caused the helicopter's collision into the mountain.</p>

<p>Iran's army in May similarly said it had found no evidence of criminal activity in the crash that also killed Raisi's foreign minister, Hossein Amir-Abdollahian.</p>

<p>In August, Fars news agency cited the main causes of the May 19 crash as bad weather conditions and the helicopter's inability to ascend with two extra passengers against security protocols.</p>

<p>But the Iranian armed forces were quick to reject the finding saying, "what is mentioned on Fars news about the presence of two people in the helicopter against the security protocols... is completely false".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The head of Israel's powerful Histadrut trade union ordered a "complete strike" in support of Gaza hostages on Monday and urged a deal to secure their release after the bodies of six captives were recovered.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel's main union on Sunday ordered a nationwide general strike after soldiers recovered the bodies of six dead hostages from the Gaza Strip where the military is battling Palestinian operatives.</p>

<p>The remains of the six were recovered Saturday "from an underground tunnel in the Rafah area" in southern Gaza, the military said.</p>

<p>They were among 251 hostages seized during Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel that triggered the ongoing war, 97 of whom remain captive in Gaza including 33 the army says are dead.</p>

<p>Scores were released during a negotiated one-week truce in November, but relatives of those still held believe not enough is being done to free them.</p>

<p>Campaign group the Hostages and Missing Families Forum said a negotiated "deal for the return of the hostages" was urgently needed.</p>

<p>"Were it not for the delays, sabotage and excuses" in months of mediation efforts, the six hostages "would likely still be alive", a statement said.</p>

<p>The families called for a nationwide general strike to force the government to reach a deal to secure the release of the remaining captives.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards, the head of Israel's powerful Histadrut trade union ordered a "complete strike" for Monday in support of the hostages.</p>

<h3><strong>'Complete strike'</strong></h3>

<p>"I have come to the conclusion that only our intervention can shake those who need to be shaken," Histadrut chairman Arnon bar David said in a statement.</p>

<p>"Starting tomorrow at six in the morning, the entire Israeli economy will go on complete strike."</p>

<p>"A deal is not progressing due to political considerations and this is unacceptable."</p>

<p>The six hostages were named as Carmel Gat, taken from a kibbutz community near the Gaza border, and Eden Yerushalmi, Almog Sarusi, Ori Danino, US-Israeli Hersh Goldberg-Polin and Russian-Israeli Alexander Lobanov -- all seized by Palestinian operatives from a music festival site.</p>

<p>Military spokesman Daniel Hagari said all six "were abducted alive on the morning of October 7" and "brutally murdered by Hamas terrorists shortly before we reached them".</p>

<p>Qatar-based Hamas official Izzat al-Rishq said the six were "killed by Zionist (Israeli) bombing", an accusation the military denied.</p>

<p>A senior Hamas official told AFP on condition of anonymity that "some" of the six had been "approved" for release in a potential hostage-prisoner swap as part of a deal yet to be agreed.</p>

<p>Critics in Israel have accused Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of prolonging the war for political gain.</p>

<p>Netanyahu told Lobanov's parents on Sunday: "I would like to tell you how much I regret and request forgiveness for not succeeding in bringing Sasha back alive."</p>

<p>He blamed Hamas leaders "who kill hostages and do not want an agreement", vowing to "settle the score" with them.</p>

<h3><strong>West Bank attack</strong></h3>

<p>US President Joe Biden said he was "devastated and outraged" by their deaths, but told reporters he was "still optimistic" a truce and hostage release deal could be reached.</p>

<p>The Biden administration has been involved in ceasefire mediation efforts along with Qatar and Egypt.</p>

<p>In the occupied West Bank, as soldiers pressed day five of coordinated raids targeting Palestinian operatives, Israeli police said a "shooting attack" killed three officers.</p>

<p>The attack near Hebron added to surging violence in the territory where at least 24 Palestinians, including 14 operative groups said were their members, have been killed by the military since the Israeli raids began on Wednesday.</p>

<p>One 20-year-old soldier was killed Saturday in the raids, which Israel's military has called "counter-terrorism" operations.</p>

<p>On Sunday, a "shooting attack" near the Tarqumiya checkpoint in the Hebron area in the southern West Bank killed three police officers.</p>

<p>The military said it "eliminated" the suspected attacker after surrounding a house in Hebron.</p>

<p>In the northern West Bank, an AFP photographer saw Israeli bulldozers in Jenin city centre, a day after an official said soldiers had destroyed most of the streets and power and water had been cut off in the adjacent refugee camp.</p>

<p>Later on Sunday an AFP photographer heard loud explosions near the camp and saw black smoke over the city.</p>

<p>The United Nations said Wednesday that at least 637 Palestinians had been killed in the territory by Israeli troops or settlers since the Gaza war began.</p>

<p>Twenty-three Israelis, including soldiers, have been killed in Palestinian attacks or during army operations over the same period, according to official figures.</p>

<h3><strong>Polio vaccinations</strong></h3>

<p>In the besieged Gaza Strip, "humanitarian pauses" in the nearly 11-month war between Israel and Hamas were due to take place to facilitate a massive polio vaccination drive which a health official told AFP had begun in earnest Sunday.</p>

<p>Hamas's October 7 attack resulted in the deaths of 1,205 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures.</p>

<p>Israel's offensive has killed at least 40,738 people in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry. The UN rights office says most of the dead are women and children.</p>

<p>The fighting has devastated Gaza, repeatedly displaced most of its 2.4 million people and triggered a humanitarian crisis. Water, sanitation and medical facilities have been ravaged, contributing to the spread of preventable disease.</p>

<p>The World Health Organization has said Israel agreed to a series of three-day "humanitarian pauses" to facilitate the vaccination campaign that aims to reach some 640,000 children, after the first confirmed case in Gaza in 25 years.</p>

<p>On Sunday, it was formally launched at three health centres in central Gaza, said Yasser Shaaban, director of Al-Awda hospital.</p>

<p>"We hope this vaccination campaign for children will be calm," said Shaaban, noting there were "a lot of drones" flying overhead.</p>

<p>Louise Wateridge, a spokeswoman for the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, later said nearly 2,000 children were vaccinated initially Sunday.</p>

<p>But she added that they were anxious about later: "If the bombing continues after 2:00 pm this is of course going to impact the vaccination campaign... The only way to do this is a ceasefire."</p>

<p>On Sunday, rescuers in the Gaza Strip said 10 people had been killed in Israeli bombardment and an air strike.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Even in the UK's most Conservative constituency, the former governing party's contest to choose a new leader is failing to set pulses racing.</p>

<p>Six former ministers have jostled for the past month to succeed ex-Prime Minister Rishi Sunak at the helm of the Tory Party. But with their battle confined largely to closed-door hustings among party faithful and op-eds in the national press, voters in Harrow East - where more than 53% of those who turned out at the general election on July 4 voted Conservative - showed little enthusiasm for the proceedings when approached by Bloomberg.</p>

<p>"I don't think the Tories will win again," said Patricia Tubbritt, a pensioner who was en route to the supermarket with a trolley bag in tow. After abandoning the Conservatives last month in favour of Reform UK, an insurgent party to its right, she professed herself uninspired by the six candidates and spoke of her nostalgia for former premier Boris Johnson, who was ousted in 2022 by his own party after a series of scandals, and no longer sits in Parliament. "He's the only chance of good leadership," she said.</p>

<p>The views in Harrow underscore the challenge facing whichever contender emerges victorious on Nov. 2. Their task is to rebuild Britain's self-styled natural party of government from the ruins of its worst-ever defeat and make it electable once more. And they have to achieve that when even voters in their most loyal constituency aren't certain they've got the right diagnosis of the country's ills.</p>

<p>"Why would voters care? The Tories were pummeled in the election," said Rob Ford, a professor of political science at the University of Manchester. "When you are the opposition, it is a daily struggle to get people to pay attention to you at all."&nbsp;</p>

<p>The bookmakers' favourite is former Business Secretary Kemi Badenoch, who's been joined in the starting line-up by former Foreign Secretary James Cleverly, ex-Home Office Minister Robert Jenrick, Priti Patel - a former Home Secretary, Mel Stride, who held the work and pensions brief under Sunak, and former Security Minister Tom Tugendhat.</p>

<p>But in Harrow East, the contest has failed to invigorate the sort of voters the Tories must win back nationwide to rebuild their fortunes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dotted with retirement villages, Hindu temples, farms, and a generous helping of curry houses, the leafy district at the end of the London Underground's Jubilee Line was the only constituency in the country where more than 50% of votes cast last month went to the Tories.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Of 25 people interviewed by Bloomberg in Harrow, including eight who voted Tory on July 4 and 10 who said they'd previously opted for the party, just one signalled any interest in the outcome of the leadership race, saying they favoured Tugendhat. The others either declined to pick a favourite candidate or saw little prospect in any winner reviving a party that led successive UK governments for the past 14 years and for more than 60 years over the past century.&nbsp;</p>

<p>One - who like all eight Tory voters asked not to be named airing their political views - said they didn't think any of the candidates had what it takes. Another, who was tending to some greenery near Harrow East's Conservative Association, likened the Tories to a boat without oars. A woman who described herself as a lifelong Conservative said she didn't think the party would ever win the keys to 10 Downing Street again.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Those sentiments reflect the scale of rebuilding required by the Tories, who won just 121 of the 650 seats in the House of Commons on July 4 - eclipsing previous nadirs of 156 in 1906 and 165 in the Tony Blair landslide in 1997.</p>

<p>The leadership contest is about to step up a gear, with launch speeches expected from Badenoch, Cleverly and Tugendhat this week after Patel delivered hers on Friday. Tory MPs will whittle the candidates down to four before the party's annual conference this month and then to two, who will go to a wider vote among grassroots members.</p>

<p>The winner must choose whether to pivot right to win back voters who defected to the populist anti-immigration Reform UK party led by Nigel Farage, or toe a more moderate line to appeal to the 46% of UK voters who opted for Liberal Democrat or Labour on July 4.</p>

<p>That tug of war could be summed up in the views of two Harrow voters: The Tugendhat supporter, who described the former security minister as the only viable option because of his centrist views, and Jenny Lawrence, a lifelong Conservative in her 50s who switched to Reform this year, calling Farage's outfit "the only alternative." The Tories, she said, have no future if they continue to fail to match their actions to their rhetoric.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It's not just those who switched parties who the Tories must win back by the next election, but also those who didn't vote. Turnout was the lowest in almost a quarter of a century, at 59.8%, as voters who didn't think the Conservatives deserved another term, but were uninspired by Labour, switched off.&nbsp;</p>

<p>James Baxter, a 76-year-old former airline worker, said he considers himself a Conservative, but this year, stayed at home on election day. "I was uninspired," he explained. "I don't think any of them know what they're talking about."</p>

<p>Harrow East was successfully defended by Bob Blackman - &nbsp;a Tory who's represented the area since 2010. He took the highest vote share of any Conservative, and his 11,680 majority is the party's third safest, bettered only by Sunak in Richmond and Northallerton and former City Minister Andrew Griffith in Arundel and South Downs.</p>

<p>Blackman's campaign manager, Matthew Goodwin-Freeman, sees the opportunity for the next Tory leader in the nature of this July's election. That's because Keir Starmer's Labour Party took just 33.7% of the vote while sweeping to a huge win in terms of seats.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"In five years' time when we have the general election, the whole 'I'm fed up with the Conservatives' will be over because they won't have been in power," Goodwin-Freeman said. "Don't think this is a decade of Labour by any stretch of the imagination."</p>

<p>Starmer's Labour showed what is possible in modern British politics by sweeping to a huge victory just five years after sinking to its worst defeat since the 1930s.</p>

<p>"If the Tories get back on the pitch, those big swings are possible," said the University of Manchester's Ford. "These are volatile political times."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

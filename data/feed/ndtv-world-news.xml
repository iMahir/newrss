       <description><![CDATA[Out of over 10,000 Palestinian applications, only 2922 were approved, while nearly 8750 Israeli visas were granted following the October 7 attacks.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The air and ground operation has killed more than 40,000 people in Gaza, according to the Hamas-ruled territory's health ministry. After Palestinian terrorist group Hamas carried out the deadliest attack in Israeli history on October 7, 2023, Israel responded with a devastating military campaign in Gaza.</p>

<p>As a result, the number of Palestinians fleeing to other nations seeking refuge-including Australia-has increased. But there's a sharp difference in Australia when it comes to visa approval statistics; most Palestinian applications are turned down, but a disproportionately high number of Israeli visas are approved.</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.news.com.au/national/politics/majority-of-palestinians-fleeing-gaza-to-australia-have-had-their-visas-refused/news-story/cccaed5acd91f8a5bc83d0a4e54ad2a4"><em>News Corp Australia,</em></a> Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke has confirmed that out of the 10,033 applications launched in the past 10 months, 7111 were rejected, while 2922 Palestinians were granted entry into Australia. Out of the 2922 figure, about 1300 refugees have resettled into Australia, who are understood to largely be on short-term visas.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, 8746 Israeli citizens have been granted visas since the October 7 attacks, with 235 applications rejected.</p>

<p>The report was released concurrently with calls by main opposition leader Peter Dutton to stop the entry of Palestinians from Gaza on the grounds that they were a threat to national security.</p>

<p>"I don't think people should be coming in from that war zone at all at the moment," Dutton said on Wednesday. "It's not prudent to do so, and I think it puts our national security at risk."</p>

<p>His remarks were a reaction to what happened on Tuesday, when Coalition Members of Parliament wrote to Tony Burke, urging him to tighten the process of evaluating visa applications from Gaza to make sure they had no support for Hamas. As it stands, applicants are only rejected if they are found to have given financial or material support to Hamas.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[From an economic perspective, the concerns around the AI bubble mirror those seen in past tech booms, such as the "dot-com bubble" of the late 1990s.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is widely regarded as a revolutionary technology, fuelling growth in various sectors and creating a surge in demand for specialised hardware, particularly from companies like Nvidia. <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2024/08/07/is-the-ai-bubble-about-to-burst/">According to <em>Forbes</em></a>, Nvidia's stock price has more than tripled in a year. Other tech giants like Google and Microsoft, invested heavily in AI, have also seen large increases. However, alongside the excitement, concerns have been growing about the sustainability of the AI boom, raising the spectre of a potential bubble bursting.</p>

<h3><strong>The Rise Of Nvidia: From Chipmaker To AI Giant</strong></h3>

<p>Nvidia has become a poster child for the AI boom, primarily due to its dominance in the GPU market, which is essential for AI training and inference tasks. The company briefly became the world's most valuable firm in June 2024, dethroning Microsoft, largely due to skyrocketing demand for AI chips. Its market capitalisation hit $3.33 trillion due to the stellar rise in its stock price. Nvidia's GPUs power the development of AI models, enabling breakthroughs in machine learning, natural language processing and other cutting-edge technologies.</p>

<p>However, Nvidia's meteoric rise has also led to concerns. Analysts have pointed out that much of Nvidia's value is tied to the belief that AI's economic potential will continue to expand exponentially. Some worry that if this expectation does not materialise, Nvidia's stock could suffer significantly, potentially signalling the burst of the AI bubble.</p>

<h3><strong>Demand And Supply Dynamics</strong></h3>

<p>The demand for AI-related hardware, especially GPUs, has far outstripped supply, with companies across the globe investing heavily in AI infrastructure. Major cloud service providers, often referred to as "hyperscalers", have placed massive orders for Nvidia's GPUs, hoping to bolster their AI capabilities. This rush has created supply chain bottlenecks, leading to rising prices and longer lead times for essential components.</p>

<p>Despite the high demand, some industry insiders are questioning whether this level of investment is sustainable. Hedge fund Elliott Management, for instance, said it was "sceptical" that Big Tech companies would keep buying the chipmaker's graphics processing units in such high volumes, and that AI is "overhyped with many applications not ready for prime time", per a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ft.com/content/24a12be1-a973-4efe-ab4f-b981aee0cd0b"><em>Financial Times</em> report</a>. The company also pointed out that AI technology consumes significant amounts of power, making some applications prohibitively expensive in the long run.</p>

<h3><strong>Power Requirements And Sustainability Concerns</strong></h3>

<p>Another critical issue is the power consumption associated with AI technologies. Training large AI models requires vast amounts of computational power, which, in turn, demands enormous energy resources. Data centres housing thousands of GPUs have to be cooled and powered continuously, leading to concerns about the environmental impact of AI expansion. Nvidia shipped 100,000 units last year expected to consume 7.3 times of energy annually.</p>

<p>The energy consumption of AI models is becoming a point of contention, as stakeholders weigh the benefits of AI against its sustainability. Some experts believe that as AI technologies mature, they will become more efficient, reducing their environmental footprint. However, others are sceptical, arguing that the demands of AI will only increase as more complex models are developed.</p>

<h3><strong>Economic Theories And The AI Bubble</strong></h3>

<p>From an economic perspective, the concerns around the AI bubble mirror those seen in past tech booms. When demand for a particular technology skyrockets, driven by expectations of future profitability, it often leads to inflated valuations of companies associated with that technology. This dynamic has been observed in other periods of technological euphoria, such as the "dot-com bubble" of the late 1990s.</p>

<p>In the case of AI, many investors are betting heavily on the technology's future potential, often without a clear understanding of how or when these investments will generate returns. The economic principle of supply and demand suggests that if AI cannot meet the lofty expectations set for it, the resulting disappointment could lead to a sharp correction in the market. This is particularly relevant to companies like Nvidia, whose fortunes are closely tied to the success of AI.</p>

<p>Additionally, as more players enter the AI hardware market, competition could increase, leading to lower prices and thinner profit margins. This could further destabilise the market, especially if the anticipated demand for AI technologies does not materialise as expected.</p>

<h3><strong>Is The AI Boom Sustainable?</strong></h3>

<p>The AI industry continues to attract massive investments, and Nvidia's growth has been a significant beneficiary of this trend. However, experts caution that this surge in interest may not be sustainable in the long term. Companies are spending billions on AI research, hardware, and applications, yet the commercial viability of many AI solutions remains uncertain. Furthermore, the power requirements and environmental impact of AI technologies present additional challenges.</p>

<p>For now, AI remains the hottest trend in technology, with Nvidia at the centre of this boom. But as history has shown with previous tech bubbles, rapid growth can sometimes be followed by an equally dramatic collapse.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The mpox outbreak in Africa is yet another example of how infectious diseases perceived to be "someone elses problem", and affecting mainly poor, developing countries, may suddenly pose unexpected global threats.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://africacdc.org/news-item/africa-cdc-declares-mpox-a-public-health-emergency-of-continental-security-mobilizing-resources-across-the-continent/">mpox outbreak</a> in Africa is yet another example of how infectious diseases perceived to be “someone else's problem”, and affecting mainly poor, developing countries, may suddenly pose unexpected global threats.</p>

<p>Other examples of neglected diseases include the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/west-nile-virus/about/index.html">West Nile</a>, <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/zika-virus">Zika</a> and <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/chikungunya/about/index.html#:%7E:text=Key%20points,is%20recommended%20for%20some%20travelers.">Chikungunya</a> viruses.</p>

<p>Mpox was discovered in <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3635111/">1958</a> (in captive monkeys, hence the original misnomer “monkeypox”) and the first human case was identified in <a href="https://www.nicd.ac.za/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/mpox-FAQ_May_24JW.pdf">1970</a>. Then for decades it was largely neglected by the scientific and public health communities, regarded as an uncommon infection in remote rural areas in tropical Africa without relevance for the rest of the world.</p>

<p>When a massive mpox outbreak hit developed countries in <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/situations/monkeypox-oubreak-2022">2022</a>, increased research funding led to a surge in scientific studies. On just one medical search engine, <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Pubmed&amp;rlz=1C1GCEA_enZA1069ZA1069&amp;oq=Pubmed&amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIGCAEQRRg80gEJMTM2MWowajE1qAIIsAIB&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">there's been more research produced</a> since April 2022 than in the preceding 60 years.</p>

<p>The 2022-23 global mpox outbreak happened despite repeated calls from African researchers for increased global investment in diagnostic, therapeutic and infection prevention tools for mpox.</p>

<p>The WHO has now <a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/14-08-2024-who-director-general-declares-mpox-outbreak-a-public-health-emergency-of-international-concern">declared</a> the current upsurge of mpox in central Africa a public health emergency of international concern.</p>

<p>This is the highest alert level for events that constitute a public health risk to other countries and requires a coordinated international response.</p>

<p>We are infectious disease researchers who have worked on HIV, SARS-CoV-2 and other viral infections.</p>

<p>Mpox's recent history is yet another reminder that an infectious disease in one corner of the world should not be regarded as someone else's problem, as it can suddenly start to spread fast and far.</p>

<p>It also highlights global inequities in resource allocation and access to vaccines, diagnostics and treatments. These were made available in many industrialised countries and helped curb the global outbreak, but are still largely lacking in most of Africa.</p>

<h2>The 2022 outbreak: a total surprise</h2>

<p>The disease has been renamed “mpox” but the name of the virus, for now, remains “monkeypox” (MPXV). It is closely related to the smallpox virus.</p>

<p>MPXV was considered a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10257565/">zoonotic disease</a> endemic in parts of <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9643038/">central and west Africa</a>. It was acquired mainly through close contact with wild mammals, especially handling bush meat, but there was no sustained human-to-human transmission.</p>

<p>Only very occasionally were cases seen outside the endemic areas, due to infected travellers or import of infected small mammals.</p>

<p>This changed abruptly in 2022: a massive, rapidly evolving global outbreak caused over <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/08/1153141">99,000</a> laboratory-confirmed cases in 116 countries. At its peak in August 2022, over 6,000 cases were reported each week.</p>

<p>This outbreak came as a total surprise: most cases were reported from non-endemic countries, mostly in <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9264731/">men who have sex with men</a> who had become infected during recent sexual encounters.</p>

<p>Even though most cases were clinically not particularly severe and the death toll stands at just over <a href="https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/158322">200</a>, the global outbreak was declared a public health emergency of international concern by the World Health Organization on 23 July 2022.</p>

<p>Fortunately, case numbers soon plummeted due to a combination of behavioural changes and vaccination in at-risk groups.</p>

<p>Modern vaccines and antiviral drugs with activity against mpox were made available in many affected high-income countries.</p>

<p>These had been developed and stockpiled in the US and Europe, mostly in preparation for a potential bioweapon attack using a poxvirus.</p>

<p>The global outbreak in 2022 was caused by <a href="https://www.ijidonline.com/article/S1201-9712(24)00230-3/fulltext">clade II of MPXV</a>, which is endemic in west Africa and not as virulent as <a href="https://www.ijidonline.com/article/S1201-9712(24)00230-3/fulltext">clade I MPXV</a>, which so far has only been seen in the Congo Basin.</p>

<p>That first mpox public health emergency of international concern was declared over in May 2023.</p>

<p>Clade II MPXV infections are still occurring globally, but the worst seems over – for now.</p>

<p>Complacency would be misguided, as illustrated by the current mpox outbreak that is gathering steam.</p>

<h2>Upsurge in Africa</h2>

<p>The African region is experiencing an upsurge in mpox cases which started in 2023.</p>

<p>As the continent which includes the areas where mpox has been endemic for a long time, Africa now presents a complex mosaic:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>cases arising from the endemic, largely zoonotic, pattern that used to be predominant in the past</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>cases linked to the 2022 global outbreak, for example in South Africa</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>most worryingly, ever increasing numbers of MPXV clade Ib infections reported from the Democratic Republic of Congo.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>New, more dangerous strain</h2>

<p>The current clade I MPXV (formerly called Congo Basin strain) is more virulent than the clade II (west African) strain, resulting in a higher case fatality rate.</p>

<p>The ongoing outbreak has its epicentre in <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2024-DON522">South Kivu</a> province, eastern DRC, and has the potential to fuel a large pandemic.</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>It has a distinct epidemiological pattern with sustained chains of human-to-human transmission, often via the sexual route.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>It may have increased transmissibility (we don't know yet).</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The virus which causes it is the newly defined clade Ib lineage. It displays mutations that are the hallmark of human-to-human spread that is estimated to have been happening since September 2023.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Case numbers are rising rapidly, even though many suspected cases are likely not tested and thus not counted as confirmed. Complicating matters, a commonly used test was found to miss infections with this lineage of the virus.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>It affects mostly adults.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The case fatality rate is higher than it was in the 2022 global outbreak.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Already, this outbreak has resulted in mpox cases occurring in several neighbouring countries, including some (like Kenya) with no previous record of mpox.</p>

<p>The challenge is enormous. The eastern DRC is an area beset by multiple problems. This <a href="https://www.afro.who.int/health-topics/disease-outbreaks/outbreaks-and-other-emergencies-updates?page=0">includes</a> natural disasters, violence and infectious diseases including measles, cholera and poliomyelitis for the DRC.</p>

<p>In recent years the <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/situations/Ebola-2019-drc-">second-largest Ebola outbreak</a> ever took place in the wider area and, despite the availability of vaccines and treatments, posed considerable challenges.</p>

<h2>What needs to happen</h2>

<p>A recent <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(24)00187-6/fulltext">article</a> we co-authored in The Lancet Global Health outlines what needs to be done to contain this outbreak and prevent it from turning into an epidemic, possibly even a pandemic.</p>

<p>Equitable access to diagnostic tests, vaccines and antiviral treatments requires political commitment and financial investments.</p>

<p>Scientific investigations are needed to learn more about exposure settings, transmission routes and clinical presentations.</p>

<p>It's important to find the best ways to make these interventions.</p>

<p>We have proposed the establishment of an African-led, multidisciplinary, multi-country Mpox Research Consortium (MpoxReC) in Africa.</p>

<p>It should conduct research towards the elimination of mpox as a public health problem.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that a disease in one corner of the world can suddenly become a global heath threat. It's time the global health system woke up to this reality.<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<ol>
	<li>On Friday, Pakistan has confirmed its first <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/explained-in-5-points-monkeypox-virus-infection-symptoms-and-prevention-6339236">monkeypox </a>case of the year after a 34-year-old man who recently returned from Saudi Arabia tested positive for the virus.</li>
	<li>Health officials have started to identify people who were in close contact with the man, including fellow passengers on his flight from Saudi Arabia.</li>
	<li>In Pakistan, 11 cases have been reported since April 2023, with one resulting in death.</li>
	<li>Sweden announced that a person in Stockholm "has been diagnosed with mpox", marking the first case of the deadly strain to be diagnosed outside the African continent.</li>
	<li>WHO has warned more cases of the deadly variant will likely be confirmed in Europe soon, after Sweden.</li>
	<li>The deadly virus, which has killed 548 people since the start of the year in Congo, is a viral disease caused by a virus of the genus Orthopoxvirus.</li>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/moon/what-is-a-supermoon/">supermoon</a> may sound exciting, but it's a modest coincidence.</p>

<p>As the Moon orbits Earth, its distance from us varies from 357,000 to 407,000 kilometres. When the Moon and the Sun are in almost opposite directions from Earth, we get a full moon. A “supermoon” is a full moon where its position along its orbit is within 10% of its closest approach to Earth. That's it.</p>

<p>This means a supermoon has an apparent diameter that's 14% larger than the smallest possible full moon. That's not a lot. You can't really notice the difference by eye.</p>

<p>As an astronomer, I have a problem with supermoons. There are genuine wonders to see in the night sky, so don't be disappointed by a dull, overhyped supermoon.</p>

<h2>When is the best time to view the Moon?</h2>

<p>Articles hyping supermoons are easy. ChatGPT can do it. Say it's the first supermoon since whenever, add some superlatives, and throw in a telephoto lens photo of a full moon with a landmark. Perhaps the supermoon coincides with another otherwise normal full moon, so it can be a “<a href="https://moon.nasa.gov/news/197/super-blue-moons-your-questions-answered/">blue supermoon</a>” or a “<a href="https://www.accuweather.com/en/space-news/super-worm-moon-how-to-see-the-final-full-moon-of-winter/695656">worm supermoon</a>” or whatever.</p>

<p>It's still just a full moon.</p>

<p>If you do want to look at the Moon and it happens to be a supermoon, go for it. But there are better times to admire our only natural satellite, particularly with binoculars or a telescope.</p>

<p>The best time to look at the Moon is when its shadows, as seen from Earth, are longest. These long shadows help the craters and mountains stand out from the surrounding plains, so you can appreciate the dramatic landscape of our neighbouring world.</p>

<p>The shadows are longest when the Moon appears as a half moon in the night sky. During a full moon or a supermoon the shadows are at their shortest – not nearly as impressive.</p>

<p>In fact, astronomers prefer to avoid nights with supermoons and catch up on lost sleep. Full moons flood the night sky with light and make it harder to view more subtle and interesting sights.</p>

<p>Want to look at the grand expanse of the Milky Way with the unaided eye? Want to see a meteor shower, comet or aurora? Best done without a damn supermoon.</p>

<p>It can be fun to see something truly rare or unusual in the sky. But supermoons don't qualify for that either. Using the definition I mentioned earlier, there are typically three or four supermoons each year. More restrictive definitions give us one or two supermoons per year. Not only is that not rare, it still just looks like a full moon.</p>

<p>There are rarer celestial events that really can inspire. Millions of people across the globe saw <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/science-research/heliophysics/how-nasa-tracked-the-most-intense-solar-storm-in-decades/">bright auroras in May 2024</a>, including places where truly spectacular auroras are few and far between.</p>

<p>Comets can also be wonderful. Every decade or so, a comet swings into the inner Solar System and produces a bright tail, millions of kilometres long and visible from Earth. Back when I was a student, I saw <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_Hyakutake">Comet Hyakutake's bright blue tail</a> stretch across a huge expanse of sky. Sometimes comets fizzle, but when they're great they are amazing.</p>

<h2>Want something impressive? Try an eclipse</h2>

<p>Auroras and comets can be fickle, but eclipses are predictable and put on a reliable show.</p>

<p>Take total solar eclipses, when the Moon covers the Sun and day turns briefly into night. Thousands travel across the globe to see them. I will be travelling to New South Wales for the <a href="https://eclipse.asa.astronomy.org.au/eclipse-australia-2028/">2028 eclipse</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.space.com/15689-lunar-eclipses.html">Lunar eclipses</a>, when the Moon falls within Earth's shadow, can be a more accessible eclipse experience, which is visible from your own home <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_lunar_eclipses_in_the_21st_century">every few years</a>.</p>

<p>During the best lunar eclipses, the Moon turns a dark red as the only light that reaches it comes through Earth's atmosphere.</p>

<p>As an astronomer, I encourage people to look at celestial sights. Go out and see the Moon when it can really impress – during an eclipse or viewed through a telescope.

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For more than a decade, researchers and journalists have relied on a digital tool called CrowdTangle to track and fight the spread of viral falsehoods online.</p>

<p>But earlier this week, the owner of CrowdTangle, Meta, <a href="https://transparency.meta.com/en-gb/researchtools/other-datasets/crowdtangle/">shut the tool down</a>. The tech giant has replaced it with its new Content Library, which it says will serve the same purpose and be “<a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2023/11/new-tools-to-support-independent-research/">more user friendly</a>”.</p>

<p>As long-time users of CrowdTangle to track and analyse online misinformation campaigns, we are sceptical of this claim. We are also very concerned by the fact CrowdTangle's closure comes at a time when misinformation on social media is rife – and is bound to worsen in the lead up to the November presidential election in the United States.</p>

<p>So, why did Meta decide to close CrowdTangle now? And how will this affect the fight against the spread of misinformation and disinformation online?</p>

<h2>CrowdTangle: a tried and trusted tool</h2>

<p>Founded in 2011, CrowdTangle quickly gained popularity among media outlets which used it to track and analyse trending topics and articles on social media platforms for commercial purposes. Facebook (as Meta was then called) <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/11/13594338/facebook-acquires-crowdtangle">purchased the company five years later</a>.</p>

<p>There were several reasons why CrowdTangle was a powerful tool for researchers like us who study the spread of misinformation and disinformation online. Firstly, we could download large datasets to use for computational modelling and other forms of analysis. The data was also easily searchable using keywords.</p>

<p>We could also use CrowdTangle to automatically analyse trends in large collections of data from multiple sources.</p>

<p>These features helped us <a href="https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/19312">analyse the influence of far-right accounts</a> on Facebook during the COVID pandemic. They also helped us analyse the effectiveness (or lack thereof) of Meta's content moderation policies in <a href="https://theconversation.com/conspiracy-theorist-tactics-show-its-too-easy-to-get-around-facebooks-content-policies-226118">curbing the spread of vaccine misinformation</a>.</p>

<p>But CrowdTangle was not a vital tool only for researchers like us.</p>

<p>Journalists at the New York Times used it to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/14/technology/facebook-data.html">expose the influence of far-right accounts in the US</a>. Their peers at the Australian Broadcasting Corporation also used it to monitor <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/science/2020-08-24/how-the-qanon-conspiracy-theory-is-affecting-australian-families/12564566">QAnon's growing influence during the pandemic</a>, and to track <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-08-14/meta-shuts-crowdtangle-as-disinformation-ai-runs-rampant/104214782">disinformation fuelling the recent race riots</a> in the United Kingdom.</p>

<figure><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AFMHi0EJutQ?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0" width="650"></iframe></figure>

<h2>Why is Meta closing CrowdTangle?</h2>

<p>Given researchers and journalists used CrowdTangle to expose some of Meta's failings to the world, it's somewhat unsurprising the company would question why it was funding this largely free service. Keeping it operational, logic would dictate, would be bad for business.</p>

<p>But the reasons behind the closure of CrowdTangle are also more complicated.</p>

<p>One of the co-founders of the company, Brandon Silverman, told Wired the closure was <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/meta-kills-crucial-transparency-tool-worst-possible-time/">likely part of Meta's broader withdrawal</a> from the news business.</p>

<p>This withdrawal started in 2016 when the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/21/cambridge-analytica-facebook-data-users-profit">Cambridge Analytica scandal</a> revealed news was bad for Meta's core business: selling ads.</p>

<p>While news might generate strong engagement on Meta's platforms, it is the wrong kind of engagement for advertisers. X (formerly Twitter) also recently discovered this, when technology giant IBM pulled its advertising from the platform after <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-67446797">its ads were placed next to posts by Nazis</a>.</p>

<p>Meta's policies aimed at reducing exposure to news content across its platforms make explicit its withdrawal from the news business.</p>

<p>In February, <a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/continuing-our-approach-to-political-content-on-instagram-and-threads/">the company announced</a> it would stop “proactively recommending political content from accounts you don't follow” on Instagram. It also started <a href="https://transparency.meta.com/en-gb/features/approach-to-political-content/">de-ranking</a> political content on Facebook.</p>

<p>These announcements followed Meta's decision to pull out of Australia's News Media Bargaining Code and <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2024/02/update-on-facebook-news-us-australia/">stop paying for news content</a>.</p>

<p>However, while this redirection away from news may be commercially motivated, it is also about the particular news and information that spreads on Meta's products (for example, far-right influencers outperforming legacy news).</p>

<p>This brings Meta into the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/aug/25/how-the-eu-digital-services-act-affects-facebook-google-and-others">cross-hairs of international regulators</a> and threatens its ability to operate in key markets.</p>

<h2>An inferior new tool</h2>

<p>Meta has replaced CrowdTangle with its Content Library, <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2023/11/new-tools-to-support-independent-research/">which it claims</a> will “provide researchers access to more publicly-available content across Facebook and Instagram”. The new tool <a href="https://www.cjr.org/tow_center/meta-is-getting-rid-of-crowdtangle.php">will allow access to comments and short-form video</a>, which CrowdTangle did not.</p>

<p>But the new tool has major limitations.</p>

<p>Earlier this month the Coalition for Independent Technology Research published <a href="https://independenttechresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/CrowdTangle-Survey-Report-Final.pdf">results of a survey</a> with 400 independent researchers and 50 research organisations. They indicated Meta's Content Library has reduced functionality, including an inability to export data and use external tools to analyse it. It also has reduced access to posts from public figures without a large number of followers.</p>

<p>Combined, these factors will greatly hinder research.</p>

<p>But the biggest issue with Meta's new Content Library is that it won't be freely available to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/meta-to-replace-widely-used-data-tooland-largely-cut-off-reporter-access-43fc3f9d">journalists and newsrooms</a>.</p>

<p>The exact reasons for this are unclear. What is clear, however, are the implications of this reduced access.</p>

<p>Mozilla, a not-for-profit organisation dedicated to making the internet free and open for all, <a href="https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/campaigns/open-letter-to-meta-support-crowdtangle-through-2024-and-maintain-crowdtangle-approach/">said in an open letter to Meta</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Meta's decision will effectively prohibit the outside world, including election integrity experts, from seeing what's happening on Facebook and Instagram — during the biggest election year on record. This means almost all outside efforts to identify and prevent political disinformation, incitements to violence, and online harassment of women and minorities will be silenced.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There have been countless research reports, news articles, inquiries and lawsuits regarding misuse of Meta's platforms.</p>

<p>Yet it seems the only lesson the company has learned is to be selective about which data it makes transparent – and to whom.<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Algerian boxer Imane Khelif, who won the gold medal in boxing at the Paris Olympics, said that questions about her gender affected and hurt her a lot. From former US President Donald Trump and Tesla CEO Elon Musk to British author JK Rowling and scores of others on social media targeted Ms Khelif following her first-round bout against Italy's Angela Carini that lasted 46 seconds.</p>

<p>“This thing that affected me, I'm not lying to you, it affected me,” Ms Khelif said in an interview with El Birad in Algeria. A translated video of the interview was posted on X by journalist Salaiman Ahmed.</p>

<p>"It affected me a lot, it hurt me a lot. I can't describe to you the amount of fear I had," Ms Khelif said.</p>

<p>She wondered why there was an uproar from big politicians around the world. "I was afraid, but thank God, I managed to overcome this phase, thanks to the specialists who helped me overcome this stage," she added.</p>

<p>“The scenario was very scary. Thank God, all the people of Algeria and the Arab world knew Imane Ms Khelif with her femininity, her courage, her will,” Ms Khelif said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ms Khelif's reaction came after Donald Trump repeatedly referred to her as a man during a campaign rally in Montana on August 9.</p>

<p>“Who wants men to participate in women's sports? I would like to congratulate the young woman who transitioned from a man into a boxer. He... She won the gold medal," Trump said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Musk, who has thrown his weight behind Trump for the November 5 Presidential polls, also took potshots at the Algerian boxer by indirectly referring to her as a man in a series of social media posts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Imane Khelif along with Lin Yu-ting of Taiwan was&nbsp;subjected&nbsp;to trolling and intense criticism after it surfaced that the boxers were disqualified during the 2023 IBA World Boxing Championships for failing gender eligibility tests.</p>

<p>Ms Khelif, who defeated China's Yang Liu in the Paris Olympics 2024 for gold, has also filed a cyberbullying lawsuit naming Elon Musk and Harry Potter author J K Rowling over alleged "acts of aggravated cyber harassment", according to <a href="http://https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/jk-rowling-elon-musk-imane-khelif-lawsuit-1236105185/">Variety.</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The lawsuit has been filed against X in France.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pakistan has confirmed its first monkeypox case of the year after a man who recently returned from Saudi Arabia tested positive for the virus, ARY News reported citing the Ministry of Health.</p>

<p>The 34-year-old male resident of Mardan arrived in Pakistan on August 3 and developed symptoms shortly after arriving in Peshawar and reached out to the hospital for testing.</p>

<p>The diagnosis was confirmed by Khyber Medical University in Peshawar, as per ARY News.</p>

<p>His positive diagnosis was confirmed on August 13, marking the first reported case of monkeypox in Pakistan for 2024.</p>

<p>Health officials have begun contact tracing efforts to identify and monitor individuals who were in close contact with the patient, including fellow passengers on his flight from Saudi Arabia.</p>

<p>Earlier in 2023, three passengers were diagnosed with monkeypox at Karachi's Jinnah International Airport.</p>

<p>The Director General Health told the media that all three passengers were Pakistani citizens aged between 30 and 45. The passengers have been admitted to the infectious disease hospital.</p>

<p>Monkeypox remains a significant global health issue, with the World Health Organization (WHO) reporting 99,518 cases and 208 deaths across 122 countries.</p>

<p>According to ARY News, the virus, which spreads through close contact, presents with symptoms such as fever, rash, and body aches, typically lasting 2 to 4 weeks. Despite the spread, the WHO notes that 99 per cent of those infected survive.</p>

<p>In Pakistan, 11 cases have been reported since April 2023, with one resulting in death.</p>

<p>The National Institute of Health has issued an advisory outlining guidelines for managing and preventing the spread of monkeypox, urging continued vigilance and public health monitoring.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[As monsoon rains were about to break over Pakistan, 14-year-old Shamila and her 13-year-old sister Amina were married off in exchange for money, a decision their parents made to help the family survive the threat of floods.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As monsoon rains were about to break over Pakistan, 14-year-old Shamila and her 13-year-old sister Amina were married off in exchange for money, a decision their parents made to help the family survive the threat of floods.</p>

<p>"I was happy to hear I was getting married... I thought my life would become easier," Shamila told AFP after her wedding to a man twice her age in hope of a more prosperous life.</p>

<p>"But I have nothing more. And with the rain, I fear I will have even less, if that is possible."</p>

<p>Pakistan's high rate of marriages for underage girls had been inching lower in recent years, but after unprecedented floods in 2022, rights workers warn such weddings are now on the rise due to climate-driven economic insecurity.</p>

<p>The summer monsoon between July and September is vital for the livelihoods of millions of farmers and food security, but scientists say climate change is making them heavier and longer, raising the risk of landslides, floods and long-term crop damage.</p>

<p>Many villages in the agricultural belt of Sindh have not recovered from the 2022 floods, which plunged a third of the country underwater, displaced millions and ruined harvests.</p>

<p>"This has led to a new trend of 'monsoon brides'," said Mashooque Birhmani, the founder of the NGO Sujag Sansar, which works with religious scholars to combat child marriage.</p>

<p>"Families will find any means of survival. The first and most obvious way is to give their daughters away in marriage in exchange for money."</p>

<p>Birhmani said since the 2022 floods, child marriage has spiked in villages in Dadu district, one of the worst-hit areas that for months resembled a lake.</p>

<p>In Khan Mohammad Mallah village, where Shamila and Amina were married in a joint ceremony in June, 45 underage girls have become wives since the last monsoon -- 15 of them in May and June this year.</p>

<p>"Before the 2022 rains, there was no such need to get girls married so young in our area," said village elder Mai Hajani, 65.</p>

<p>"They would work on the land, make rope for wooden beds, the men would be busy with fishing and agriculture. There was always work to be done".</p>

<p>Parents told AFP that they hurried the marriage of their daughters to save them from poverty, usually in exchange for money.</p>

<p>Shamila's mother-in-law, Bibi Sachal, said they gave 200,000 Pakistan Rupees ($720) to the young bride's parents -- a major sum in a region where most families survive on around one dollar a day.</p>

<h2>'I thought I would get lipstick'</h2>

<p>Najma Ali was initially swept up in the excitement of becoming a wife when she married at 14 in 2022 and began living with her in-laws, as is tradition in Pakistan.</p>

<p>"My husband gave my parents 250,000 rupees for our wedding. But it was on loan (from a third party) that he has no way of paying back now," she said.</p>

<p>"I thought I would get lipstick, makeup, clothes and crockery," she told AFP, cradling her six-month-old baby.</p>

<p>"Now I am back home with a husband and a baby because we have nothing to eat."</p>

<p>Their village, which lies on the banks of a canal in the Main Nara Valley, is barren and there are no fish left in the polluted water -- its stench overwhelms the area.</p>

<p>"We had lush rice fields where girls used to work," said Hakim Zaadi, 58, the village matron and Najma's mother.</p>

<p>"They would grow many vegetables, which are all dead now because the water in the ground is poisonous. This has happened especially after 2022," she added.</p>

<p>"The girls were not a burden on us before then. At the age girls used to get married, they now have five children, and they come back to live with their parents because their husbands are jobless."</p>

<h2>'I want to study'</h2>

<p>Child marriages are common in parts of Pakistan, which has the sixth-highest number of girls married before the age of 18 in the world, according to government data published in December.</p>

<p>The legal age for marriage varies from 16 to 18 in different regions, but the law is rarely enforced.</p>

<p>UNICEF has reported "significant strides" in reducing child marriage, but evidence shows that extreme weather events put girls at risk.</p>

<p>"We would expect to see an 18 percent increase in the prevalence of child marriage, equivalent to erasing five years of progress," it said in a report after the 2022 floods.</p>

<p>Dildar Ali Sheikh, 31, had planned to marry off his eldest daughter Mehtab while living in an aid camp after being displaced by the floods.</p>

<p>"When I was there, I thought to myself 'we should get our daughter married so at least she can eat and have basic facilities'," the daily wage labourer told AFP.</p>

<p>Mehtab was just 10 years old.</p>

<p>"The night I decided to get her married, I couldn't sleep," said her mother, Sumbal Ali Sheikh, who was 18 when she married.</p>

<p>An intervention from the NGO Sujag Sansar led to the wedding being postponed, and Mehtab was enrolled in a sewing workshop, allowing her to earn a small income while continuing her education.</p>

<p>But when the monsoon rains fall, she is overcome by dread that her promised wedding will also arrive.</p>

<p>"I have told my father I want to study," she said. "I see married girls around me who have very challenging lives and I don't want this for myself."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Members of Congress on Thursday called on Meta chief Mark Zuckerberg to give them details regarding ads for opioids and other illicit drugs on the tech titan's platform.</p>

<p>A letter signed by 19 lawmakers pressed for details about such ads given disturbing reports by the Tech Transparency Project and the Wall Street Journal.</p>

<p>"Meta appears to have continued to shirk its social responsibility and defy its own community guidelines," the letter read.</p>

<p>"What is particularly egregious about this instance is that this was not user-generated content on the dark web or on private social media pages, but rather they were advertisements approved and monetized by Meta."</p>

<p>The Tech Transparency Project in March reported finding more than 450 ads on Instagram and Facebook selling an array of illegal drugs.</p>

<p>Many of the ads "made no secret of their intentions," showing photos of prescription drug bottles or bricks of cocaine, and encouraging people to place orders, according to the non-profit research group.</p>

<p>The investigation involved searching Meta's Ad Library for terms including "OxyContin," "Vicodin," and "pure coke," TTP reported.</p>

<p>The letter from Congress members to Zuckerberg asked for answers from Zuckerberg by Sept. 6.</p>

<p>Questions included how may illicit drug ads Meta has run on its platform, what it has done about them, and whether viewers were targeted for such ads based on personal health information.</p>

<p>Meta planned to respond to the letter.</p>

<p>"Drug dealers are criminals who work across platforms and communities, which is why we work with law enforcement to help combat this activity," a Meta spokesperson said in response to an AFP inquiry.</p>

<p>"Our systems are designed to proactively detect and enforce against violating content, and we reject hundreds of thousands of ads for violating our drug policies."</p>

<p>Meta continues to invest in improving its ability to catch illicit drug ads, the spokesperson added.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Joe Biden and Kamala Harris made an upbeat show of unity Thursday as they held their first joint public event since Harris replaced the president as the Democratic Party's candidate in November's election.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Joe Biden and Kamala Harris made an upbeat show of unity Thursday as they held their first joint public event since Harris replaced the president as the Democratic Party's candidate in November's election.</p>

<p>Chants of "Thank you Joe!" rang out from the audience at a community college in the Maryland suburbs outside Washington.</p>

<p>Biden announced a major deal to reduce medication prices for retirees on social welfare programs.</p>

<p>But the biggest star was Biden's vice president who has surprised many by uniting the Democratic Party and surging in the polls against Republican Donald Trump since her abrupt entry into the White House race.</p>

<p>"She can make one hell of a president," Biden said of Harris.</p>

<p>Shortly after the joint appearance, Trump delivered rambling and often angry remarks from his New Jersey golf club, before taking questions from a handful of journalists.</p>

<p>Harris has a "very strong communist lean" and will mean the "death of the American dream," he said.</p>

<p>The real estate billionaire and scandal-engulfed former president has struggled to pivot his campaign since Biden dropped out on July 21 amid Democratic concerns that he lacked the stamina at 81 to do the job.</p>

<p>Until then, Trump was rising steadily in the polls, in large part on his message that Biden was losing his mental acuity -- a charge that gained currency when the president badly flubbed a televised presidential debate against his predecessor.</p>

<p>At his golf club event, the 78-year-old Trump began by reading lengthy statements from a binder notebook.</p>

<p>Ostensibly scheduled to attack Harris on inflation, with household products piled high on a table next to him, he almost immediately veered off into a series of complaints about the media and insults at Harris, who he said is "not smart."</p>

<p>Regarding the Israeli war against Hamas in Gaza, Trump said he'd told Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, in a July meeting to "get your victory and get it over with... The killing has to stop."</p>

<p>Then at a later event with Jewish supporters, Trump turned his fire on Harris, claiming she has "maneuvered" to get support from "venomous anti-Semites in her party."</p>

<p>Harris is married to a Jew who, if she wins election, would make history as the first Jewish spouse of a US president -- as well as the first man in the role.</p>

<p>Using his trademark inflammatory language, Trump claimed that if Harris wins, "the radical left flag burners and Hamas sympathizers will not just be causing chaos on our streets. They'll be running US foreign policy in the White House, and Israel will be gone."</p>

<h3><strong>Biden lame duck&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>For Biden, Thursday's event was half victory lap, half acknowledgment that he is entering his presidency's lame duck period.</p>

<p>Harris, 59, is set to be crowned as Democratic nominee at the party convention in Chicago next week.</p>

<p>But she made a display of vice presidential deference, delivering only short remarks to introduce Biden and stressing that it has been her honor to serve under the "most extraordinary human being."</p>

<p>"There's a lot of love in this room for our president," she said to cheers.</p>

<p>Biden appeared energized, drawing cheers when he said the Democrats' plan was to "beat the hell out of" Republican opponents and he prompted laughter on pretending not to know Trump's name -- "Donald Dump or Donald whatever."</p>

<p>The drug prices deal will reduce costs for retirees on 10 key medicines, including treatments for diabetes, heart failure and blood clots.</p>

<p>Americans face the highest prescription drug prices in the world, leaving many people to pay at least partly out of their own pocket, despite already exorbitant insurance premiums.</p>

<p>On Friday, Harris will for the first time lay out details of her economic platform.</p>

<p>The United States' first female, Black and South Asian vice president is expected largely to stick to Biden's economic agenda while trying to differentiate herself, avoiding voter wrath over the post-Covid pandemic surge in inflation.</p>

<p>While Trump has long polled more strongly on the economy, a recent poll from the Financial Times and University of Michigan found voters trust Harris more on the issue, by 42 to 41 percent.</p>

<p>Trump, who survived an assassination attempt on July 13, is now the oldest presidential nominee in US history.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 41-year-old woman named Jasveen Sangha is at the centre of the investigation around the shocking death of FRIENDS actor Matthew Perry.</p>

<p>The dual British and American citizen, dubbed the "Ketamine Queen of Los Angeles", has been charged for supplying the lethal dose of ketamine that killed 54-year-old American actor last year.</p>

<p>Sangha allegedly ran a drug empire out of her Hollywood home where she stored, packaged, and sold methamphetamines, cocaine and prescription drugs. When her house was raided, federal agents found 79 bottles of liquid ketamine and nearly 2,000 meth pills.</p>

<p>For Mr Perry, Sangha allegedly provided his assistant with 50 vials of the ketamine on two different occasions in October last year that he gave to Mr Perry.</p>

<p>Sangha first provided him with a sample of ketamine in an unmarked glass vial for Mr Perry to try on October 13. The next day he returned to buy 25 vials from her. A week after that he bought another 25 vials of the drug.</p>

<p>Sangha also offered "ketamine lollipops" to Mr Perry's assistant as a goodwill gesture for Mr Perry's large order.</p>

<p>Mr Perry took six doses a day for three days till the day his body was found floating face down in his indoor pool last year.</p>

<p>After Mr Perry's death, Sangha told his assistant to delete messages between them that allegedly show her asking for online payments and providing instruction on the strength of the drug dosage.</p>

<p>"Within days of receiving this text, defendant Sangha confirmed that ketamine can kill by conducting a Google search for 'can ketamine be listed as a cause of?'" the indictment alleges, adding that just two week after the actor's death, she took a trip to Tokyo.</p>

<p>Sangha is charged with conspiracy to distribute ketamine, maintaining a drug-involved premises, possession with intent to distribute methamphetamine and ketamine, and five counts of distribution of ketamine.</p>

<p>If convicted, she faces a minimum of 10 years behind bars and a maximum of life imprisonment.</p>

<p>Mr Perry, who gained fame worldwide for playing the sarcastic Chandler Bing in hit tv sitcom FRIENDS, never shied away from talking about his drug addiction and depression.</p>

<p>He had revealed that he used "ketamine therapy" to treat his depression". On the day of his death, the "17 Again" actor was found with 3.54 micrograms per milliliter of ketamine in his system - or nearly three times the normal amount.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An intense debate surrounding the cosmic rock that killed the dinosaurs has stirred scientists for decades, but a new study has revealed some important -- and far-out -- data about the impactor's origin story.</p>

<p>Researchers, whose findings were published Thursday in the journal Science, used an innovative technique to demonstrate that the apocalyptic culprit which slammed into the Earth's surface 66 million years ago, causing the most recent mass extinction, had formed beyond Jupiter's orbit.</p>

<p>They also refute the idea that it was a comet.</p>

<p>The new insights into the apparent asteroid that cratered into Chicxulub, in what is present-day Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula, could improve the understanding of celestial objects that have struck our planet.</p>

<p>"Now we can, with all this knowledge... say that this asteroid initially formed beyond Jupiter," Mario Fischer-Godde, lead author of the study and a geochemist at the University of Cologne, told AFP.</p>

<p>The conclusions are particularly notable, given how rarely this type of asteroid collides with Earth.</p>

<p>Such information may well prove useful in assessing future threats, or determining how water arrived on this planet, Fischer-Godde said.</p>

<h3><strong>Samples&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>The new findings are based on an analysis of sediment samples formed at the period between the Cretaceous and Paleogene eras, the time of the asteroid's cataclysmic impact.</p>

<p>Researchers measured the isotopes of the element ruthenium, which is not uncommon on asteroids but extremely rare on Earth. So by inspecting the deposits in multiple geological layers that mark the debris from the impact at Chicxulub, they could be sure that the ruthenium studied came "100 per cent from this asteroid."</p>

<p>"Our lab in Cologne is one of the rare labs that can do these measurements," and it was the first time such study techniques were used on impact debris layers, Fischer-Godde said.</p>

<p>Ruthenium isotopes can be used to distinguish between the two main groups of asteroids: C-type, or carbonaceous, asteroids that formed in the outer solar system, and S-type silicate asteroids from the inner solar system, nearer the sun.</p>

<p>The study affirms that the asteroid that triggered a mega-earthquake, precipitated a global winter and wiped out the dinosaurs and most other life, was a C-type asteroid that formed beyond Jupiter.</p>

<p>Studies from two decades ago had already made such an assumption but with far less certainty.</p>

<p>The conclusions are striking, because most meteorites -- pieces of asteroids that fall to Earth -- are S-types, Fischer-Godde pointed out.</p>

<p>Does that mean the Chicxulub impactor formed beyond Jupiter and made a beeline for our planet? Not necessarily.</p>

<p>"We cannot be really sure where the asteroid was kind of hiding just before it impacted on Earth," Fischer-Godde said, adding that after its formation, it may have made a stopover in the asteroid belt, located between Mars and Jupiter and where most meteorites originate.</p>

<h3><strong>Not a comet&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>The study also dismisses the idea that the destructive impactor was a comet, an amalgam of icy rock from the very edge of the solar system. Such a hypothesis was put forward in a much-publicized study in 2021, based on statistical simulations.</p>

<p>Sample analyses now show that the celestial object was far different in composition from a subset of meteorites which are believed to have been comets in the past. It is therefore "unlikely" the impactor in question was a comet, Fischer-Godde said.</p>

<p>As to the wider usefulness of his findings, the geochemist offered two suggestions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He believes that more accurately defining the nature of asteroids that have struck Earth since its beginnings some 4.5 billion years ago could help solve the enigma of the origin of our planet's water.</p>

<p>Scientists believe water may have been brought to Earth by asteroids, likely of the C-type like the one that struck 66 million years ago, even though they are less frequent.</p>

<p>Studying past asteroids also allows humanity to prepare for the future, Fischer-Godde said.</p>

<p>"If we find that earlier mass extinction events could also be related to C-type asteroid impacts, then... if there's ever going to be a C-type asteroid on an Earth-crossing orbit, we have to be very careful," he said, "because it might be the last one we witness."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Republican presidential candidate and former president Donald Trump said he appreciates the support he has received from Indian American and former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley but hasn't taken her advice related to campaigning.</p>

<p>"I fought Nikki (Haley) very hard. I beat her in her own state by legendary numbers. I get along with her fine. I appreciate that she endorsed me," Trump said to reporters at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, on Thursday.</p>

<p>Trump was responding to questions about a recent interview of Haley in which she said that the Republican presidential nominee should quit whining about his Democratic opponent Vice President Kamala Harris and instead focus on policy issues.</p>

<p>"You can't win on those things. American people are smart. Treat them like they're smart. It's not about her. It's about the American people. Talk to them and let them know you need their vote," Haley told Fox News in an interview.</p>

<p>"I think I'm doing a very calm campaign. I mean, we're here. There's no shouting. Now you'll say he ranted and raved, …. I'm a very calm person. Believe it or not. If I wasn't, I probably wouldn't be around anymore. I appreciate her advice but I have to do it my way," Trump said.</p>

<p>He said that he ran against Haley in his own ways and "won in South Carolina by numbers that nobody's ever seen before".</p>

<p>"I think she's (Haley) a good woman. I'd love to have her support. She gave me support," Trump added.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Republican US presidential candidate Donald Trump said on Thursday he told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during their last meeting in July to quickly end Israel's war in Gaza, but the former president also criticized ceasefire demands.</p>

<p>"He knows what he's doing, I did encourage him to get this over with," Trump told reporters at a press conference on Thursday. "It has to get over with fast. ... Get your victory and get it over with. It has to stop, the killing has to stop."</p>

<p>Trump was referring to his meeting with Netanyahu at his Mar-a-Lago residence in late July, when Netanyahu visited the United States. He also met President Joe Biden and Vice President and Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris during his trip.</p>

<p>There has been an increased risk of a broader war in the Middle East after the recent killings of Palestinian Islamist group Hamas' leader Ismail Haniyeh in Iran and Hezbollah military commander Fuad Shukr in Beirut. Both drew threats of retaliation against Israel.</p>

<p>In an event later on Thursday about tackling antisemitism, Trump criticized Biden and Harris' months-long calls for a ceasefire in Gaza.</p>

<p>"From the start, Harris has worked to tie Israel's hand behind its back, demanding an immediate ceasefire, always demanding ceasefire," Trump said, adding it "would only give Hamas time to regroup and launch a new October 7 style attack."</p>

<p>Trump added: "I will give Israel the support that it needs to win but I do want them to win fast."</p>

<p>In the same event, Trump also labelled pro-Palestinian supporters calling for an end to US support for Israel's war as "pro-Hamas thugs" and "jihad sympathizers." He threatened to arrest and deport them from the US if he became president.</p>

<p>Netanyahu's office and Trump both separately denied on Thursday an Axios report that said they had spoken the previous day about the Gaza ceasefire and hostage release talks.</p>

<p>Biden laid out a three-phase ceasefire proposal in an address on May 31. Washington and regional mediators have since tried arranging the Gaza ceasefire-for-hostages deal but have run into repeated obstacles.</p>

<p>The Axios report cited two US sources. One source said the reported call was intended to encourage Netanyahu to take the deal, but stressed he did not know if this is indeed what the former president told Netanyahu.</p>

<p>Egypt, the United States and Qatar have scheduled a new round of Gaza ceasefire negotiations this week.</p>

<p>Washington, Israel's most important ally, has said that a ceasefire in Gaza will reduce the rising threat of a wider war.</p>

<p>The latest bloodshed in the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict was triggered on Oct. 7 when Hamas attacked Israel, killing 1,200 and taking about 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.</p>

<p>Israel's subsequent assault on the Hamas-governed enclave has since killed over 40,000 Palestinians, according to the local health ministry, while also displacing nearly the entire population of 2.3 million, causing a hunger crisis and leading to genocide allegations at the World Court that Israel denies.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 12-year-old girl died in US' Texas after she mysteriously suffered from "life-threatening" injuries which her parents tried to treat with smoothies and vitamins, officials said.</p>

<p>Miranda Sipps died at a hospital on Monday after her parents called emergency services for help when she was unable to breathe, four days after she sustained said injuries. In a bizarre twist, after they made the call, her mother left the house with the girl in a car as she didn't want policemen inside the house.</p>

<p>While fleeing the scene, their car was stopped by police near a highway and Miranda was found unconscious but alive inside the vehicle. She was rushed to the hospital but declared dead soon after.</p>

<p>Investigation revealed that the mother, Denise Balbaneda (36) and stepfather Gerald Gonzalez (40), did not seek medical help for the girl during the four days while she was "mentally and physically incapacitated and non-responsive".</p>

<p>For four days, the couple kept their daughter at home and allegedly fed her smoothies and vitamins even though she wasn't responsive. They might have tried to giver her oxygen in an attempt to revive her, officials alleged.</p>

<p>"Basically they thought they could nurse her back to health and we do not think they wanted the attention that this would draw if the little girl was injured," Atascosa County Sheriff David Soward told local media.</p>

<p>The parents told authorities that over the four days their daughter could only "flutter her eyes and move her hands a little bit".</p>

<p>While it is not known how she sustained the severe injuries, an autopsy is being conducted to find out the nature of her injuries.</p>

<p>Her mother and stepfather have been arrested and charged with injury to a child causing serious bodily injury.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Republican presidential candidate former president Donald Trump said he is "very angry" at Vice President Kamala Harris and is entitled to personal attack on his Democratic opponent.</p>

<p>"I don't have a lot of respect for her. I don't have a lot of respect for her intelligence. I think she'll be a terrible president. I think it's very important that we win. And whether the personal attacks are good or bad … she certainly attacks me personally," Trump said to reporters at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey.</p>

<p>Trump was responding to questions from his party members urging him not to make personal attacks on Harris, who is the first woman of colour running for presidency.</p>

<p>"As far as the personal attacks (against Harris), I'm very angry at her because of what she's done to the country. I'm very angry at her that she weaponised the justice system against me and other people. (I am) very angry at her. I think I'm entitled to personal attacks," he said.</p>

<p>"She (Harris) actually called me weird. He's weird, it was just a sound bite, and she called J D (Vance, his running mate) and I weird. He's not weird. He was a great student at Yale, he went to Ohio State, graduated in two years at the top of his class and all of these different things. We have this guy that's running failed, really a very failed state who had a terrible career. I mean, you have him saying they're weird. No, he's a weird guy," Trump said.</p>

<p>He said Harris is "weird in her policy", adding that “people don't know who she is yet".</p>

<p>"She is weird in her policy. Who wouldn't want to have strongholds, who doesn't want to have lower taxes? You know, all my life I've watched as politicians campaigned and I've always been on for the most part, on the other side. This is the only campaign I've ever heard. When they're saying we're going to increase your taxes and then people say they're going to vote for," Trump said.</p>

<p>Early this week, several of his party colleagues and aides, including former Trump White House aide Peter Navarro and former Republican candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, urged him to focus on policy instead of attacking Harris.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Among the five people who have been charged in <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/took-advantage-of-his-addiction-5-charged-over-matthew-perrys-death-6345973">actor Matthew Perry</a>'s death due to a drug overdose last year is a woman called Jasveen Sangha, popularly known as "the Ketamine Queen". According to investigators, Ms Sangha provided the lethal dose of ketamine that led to Mr Perry's death.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ms Sangha, a 41-year-old dual British and American citizen, has been under the radar of federal authorities for her involvement in the distribution of dangerous narcotics. Dubbed the "Ketamine Queen of Los Angeles," Ms Sangha allegedly ran a drug operation out of her North Hollywood home, where officials claim she stored, packaged, and distributed various narcotics. According to a federal indictment, her residence was described as a "drug-selling emporium" filled with methamphetamine, cocaine, and prescription drugs like Xanax.</p>

<p>Ms Sangha's operation, which dates back to at least June 2019, came under scrutiny after she was busted in March for selling methamphetamine in an unrelated case. During the raid on her home, federal agents seized 79 bottles of liquid ketamine and nearly 2,000 meth pills, highlighting the scale of her illicit activities.</p>

<p>Mr Perry died on October 28 last year. The 'Friends' actor, who had long battled addiction, was found in his home, with his death attributed to a ketamine overdose. According to investigators, Mr Perry had obtained the fatal batch of ketamine through a broker, Eric Fleming, who in turn sourced the drug from Ms Sangha.</p>

<p>According to court documents, Ms Sangha provided Mr Fleming with 50 vials of ketamine in two separate deals in the weeks leading up to Mr Perry's death. The indictment alleges that Mr Perry first sampled the drug on October 13, and Mr Fleming subsequently delivered two large batches to Mr Perry's home on October 14 and October 24. Ms Sangha even included "ketamine lollipops" as a bonus due to the size of Mr Perry's order.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The White House on Thursday condemned what it called "unacceptable" attacks on Palestinians by Jewish settlers, after one person was killed and another wounded in a village in the occupied West Bank.</p>

<p>"Attacks by violent settlers against Palestinian civilians in the West Bank are unacceptable and must stop," a National Security Council spokesperson said in a statement.</p>

<p>"Israeli authorities must take measures to protect all communities from harm, this includes intervening to stop such violence, and holding all perpetrators of such violence to account."</p>

<p>The Palestinian health ministry said a 23-year-old man was killed and another suffered critical gunshot wounds to the chest in the attack on the village of Jit, west of Nablus.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said "dozens of Israeli civilians, some of them masked," had entered Jit and "set fire to vehicles and structures in the area, hurled rocks and Molotov cocktails."</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United States on Thursday announced its approval of a $5 billion sale of up to 600 Patriot missiles and related equipment to Germany, which has donated several of the advanced air defense systems to Ukraine.</p>

<p>The proposed sale of the PAC-3 MSE missiles "will support the foreign policy and national security of the United States by improving the security of a NATO ally that is an important force for political and economic stability in Europe," the Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) said in a statement.</p>

<p>It "will improve Germany's capability to meet current and future threats and increase the defensive capabilities of its military. It will support Germany's goal of improving national and territorial defense as well as interoperability with US and NATO forces," the statement added.</p>

<p>The State Department approved the possible sale of the missiles to Germany, and the DSCA on Thursday provided the required notification to Congress, which still needs to sign off on the transaction.</p>

<p>Germany has donated several Patriot systems to Ukraine, which has faced repeated Russian missile barrages and drone attacks targeting its infrastructure, leaving it in desperate need of additional air defenses.</p>

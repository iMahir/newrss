       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Traffic on France's high-speed rail network should be back to normal by Monday, Transport Minister Patrice Vergriete said after sabotaged signal stations and cables caused travel chaos on Friday, the opening day of the Olympic Games.</p>

<p>French rail operator SNCF reiterated that transport plans for teams competing in the Paris 2024 Olympics would be guaranteed.</p>

<p>Friday's pre-dawn attacks on the high-speed rail network damaged infrastructure along the lines connecting Paris with cities such as Lille in the north, Bordeaux in the west and Strasbourg in the east. Another attack on the Paris-Marseille line was foiled, SNCF has said.</p>

<p>There has been no immediate claim of responsibility.</p>

<p>Speaking to reporters at Paris' Montparnasse train station, Vergriete and SNCF chief Jean-Pierre Farandou said train services would continue to experience disruption throughout the weekend as they gradually return to normal.</p>

<p>On Friday, 100,000 people could not take their trains, and another 150,000 faced delays but eventually got to their destinations, Vergriete said.</p>

<p>"There will still be disruptions tomorrow," Vergriete told reporters. "From Monday, there is no need to worry."</p>

<p>Farandou confirmed this, adding that investigations were ongoing and they did not yet know who was behind the attack.</p>

<p>SNCF said in a statement that traffic would remain disrupted on Sunday on the North axis but should improve on the Atlantic axis for weekend returns.</p>

<p>"On the Eastern high-speed line, traffic resumed normally this morning at 6:30 a.m. (0530 GMT) while on the North, Brittany and South-West high-speed lines, 7 out of 10 trains on average will run with delays of 1 to 2 hours," it said.</p>

<p>Two security sources have said the modus operandi meant initial suspicions fell on leftist militants or environmental activists, but they said there was not yet any evidence.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Gabriel Attal on Friday said it was too early to say who could be behind the sabotage.</p>

<p>"What we know, what we see, is that this operation was prepared, coordinated, that nerve centres were targeted, which shows a certain knowledge of the network to know where to strike," he said.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US Vice President Kamala Harris, the most likely candidate to replace Joe Biden as the Democratic Party nominee for the November 5 presidential elections, has narrowed the margin against Donald Trump, according to latest polls. There's been a significant rise in support for her among non-white voters and within her party.</p>

<p><b>What polls say</b></p>

<p>The latest <a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/elections/harris-erases-trumps-lead-wsj-poll-finds-e286144d">Wall Street Journal </a>poll shows Harris and Trump neck-and-neck at 49% to 47% in a two-person matchup. However, the report states this was within the margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, Trump was in a six-point lead against Biden before he quit the race.</p>

<p>According to a New York Times/Siena College poll of 1,142 voters nationwide conducted between July 22-24, Trump leads Harris 48% to 47% among likely voters in a head-to-head match.</p>

<p>This is a significant improvement for the Democrats after numbers earlier this month showed Biden behind by six percentage points.</p>

<p>Besides this, the polls further state that Trump currently leads Harris 48% to 46% among the registered voters. Earlier, he led among registered voters by nine percentage points over Biden.</p>

<p>Harris' gain primarily comes from parts of the Democratic coalition that earlier soured on Biden.</p>

<p>The US President was getting only 59% of Black registered voters in the <a href="http://https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/25/us/politics/poll-kamala-harris-donald-trump.html">New York Times</a> poll a month ago. However, now Harris is expected to get 69% of these votes. Apart from that, Harris has also increased her party's share of Hispanic voters from 45% to 57% and under 30 voters from 46% to 56%.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-26/kamala-harris-polls-show-trump-lead-narrowing-in-2024-election?srnd=homepage-asia">Bloomberg</a>, an unweighted average of the polls conducted after Biden left the presidential race shows Harris trailing Trump by 1.6 percentage points.</p>

<p><b>Kamala Harris declares her candidacy</b></p>

<p>Harris, on Saturday, signed the forms officially declaring her candidacy for President of the United States. "I will work hard to earn every vote. And in November, our people-powered campaign will win," she wrote on X.</p>

<p>This came after US President Joe Biden, 81, on July 21 announced his exit from the presidential race and endorsed Harris as the nominee of the party. Harris has further received support from former US President Barack Obama and ex-First Lady Michelle Obama.</p>

<p>The US vice president has secured the support of a majority of Democratic delegates and seems all set to be the official nominee at the party convention next month.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At least 30 Palestinians were killed in an Israeli strike on a school in Deir al Balah in central Gaza, Palestinian health officials said, and the Israeli military said it had struck a Hamas command centre.</p>

<p>The Gaza health ministry and the Hamas-run government media office gave the toll for those killed in the strike on the school in Deir Al-Balah, one of the areas most populated with displaced families, and said over 100 others were wounded.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said in a statement it had targeted a "Hamas command and control center inside the Khadija school compound in central Gaza".</p>

<p>The statement said the school was being used to launch attacks against troops and as a weapons cache and that it warned civilians before the strike.</p>

<p>At Al-Aqsa Hospital in Deir Al-Balah, ambulances raced wounded Palestinians into the medical facility. Some of the wounded also arrived on foot, with their clothes stained with blood.</p>

<p>In previous such strikes that have hit civilian infrastructure, Israel's military has blamed the Islamist group Hamas for putting civilians in harm's way, accusing it of operating within densely populated neighbourhoods, schools and hospitals as cover. Hamas denies this.</p>

<p>Earlier on Saturday, Palestinian official media said that at least 14 Palestinians were killed by Israeli attacks since dawn in the southern city of Khan Younis and that their bodies were brought to Nasser Medical Complex.</p>

<p>The Israeli military told Palestinians to temporarily evacuate southern neighborhoods of Khan Younis so it could "forcefully operate" there, telling them to relocate to a humanitarian area in Al-Mawasi, a military statement said.</p>

<p>The military said its calls to evacuate were communicated to the population via several mediums in order to mitigate danger to civilians.</p>

<p>In Al-Bureij refugee camp, five Palestinians were killed earlier in an Israeli air strike on a house, while four others were killed in another strike on a house in Rafah, near the border with Egypt, medics said.</p>

<p>U.N. and humanitarian officials accuse Israel of using disproportionate force in the war and of failing to ensure civilians have safe places to go, which it denies.</p>

<p>On Friday the military said troops battled Palestinian fighters in Khan Younis, and destroyed tunnels and other infrastructure, as they sought to suppress small operative units that have continued to hit troops with mortar fire.</p>

<p>The fighting, more than nine months after the start of Israel's invasion of Gaza following the Hamas-led Oct. 7 attack, underlined the difficulty the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) has in eliminating fighters of the group amid continued resistance.</p>

<p>On Friday the military said troops battled Palestinian fighters in Khan Younis, and destroyed tunnels and other infrastructure, as they sought to suppress small operative units that have continued to hit troops with mortar fire.</p>

<p>More than 39,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli strikes in the enclave, according to Gaza health authorities, who do not distinguish between fighters and non-combatants.</p>

<p>Israeli officials estimate that some 14,000 fighters from groups including Hamas and Islamic Jihad have been killed or taken prisoner, out of a force they estimated to number more than 25,000 at the start of the war.</p>

<p>Around 1,200 people were killed and 250 were taken hostage in the Oct. 7 raid on southern Israel, according to Israeli tallies.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken met his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi on Saturday during a regional summit in Laos, hours after criticising Beijing's "escalating and unlawful actions" in the South China Sea.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken met his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi on Saturday during a regional summit in Laos, hours after criticising Beijing's "escalating and unlawful actions" in the South China Sea.</p>

<p>Blinken and Wang shook hands and exchanged greetings in front of cameras but made no comments before moving to closed-doors talks in what will be their sixth meeting since June 23, when Blinken visited Beijing in a significant sign of improvement for strained relations between the world's two biggest economies.</p>

<p>Though Blinken had singled out China over its actions against U.S. defence ally the Philippines in the South China Sea during a meeting with Southeast Asian counterparts earlier on Saturday, he also lauded the two countries for their diplomacy after Manila completed a resupply mission to troops in an area also claimed by Beijing.</p>

<p>The troop presence has for years angered China, which has clashed repeatedly with the Philippines over Manila's missions to a grounded navy ship at the Second Thomas Shoal, causing regional concern about an escalation.</p>

<p>The two sides this week reached an arrangement over how to conduct those missions.</p>

<p>"We are pleased to take note of the successful resupply today of the Second Thomas shoal, which is the product of an agreement reached between the Philippines and China," Blinken told ASEAN foreign ministers.</p>

<p>"We applaud that and hope and expect to see that it continues going forward."</p>

<h3><strong>Gaza Situation 'Dire'</strong></h3>

<p>Blinken and Wang attended Saturday's security-focussed ASEAN Regional Forum in Laos alongside top diplomats of major powers including Russia, India, Australia, Japan, the European, Britain and others, before heading to their meeting.</p>

<p>Blinken said earlier the United States was "working intensely every single day" to achieve a ceasefire in Gaza and find a path to more enduring peace and security.</p>

<p>His remarks follow those of Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi, who said the need for sustainable peace was urgent and international law should be applied to all. The comment from the world's largest Muslim-majority nation, was a veiled reference to recent decisions by two international courts over Israeli's Gaza offensives.</p>

<p>"We cannot continue closing our eyes to see the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza," she said.</p>

<p>More than 39,000 Palestinians have been killed in the fighting in Gaza since Israel launched its incursion, according to Palestinian health authorities, who do not distinguish between fighters and non-combatants.</p>

<p>Israeli officials estimate that some 14,000 fighters from fighter groups including Hamas and Islamic Jihad, have been killed or taken prisoner, out of a force they estimated to number more than 25,000 at the start of the war.</p>

<p>The war began when Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, killing 1,200 people and abducting some 250 others, according to Israeli tallies.</p>

<p>Also in Laos, Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said guidelines on the operation of U.S. nuclear assets on the Korean peninsula were certain to add to regional security concerns.</p>

<p>Lavrov, according to South Korean news agency Yonhap, said he had not been briefed on the details of the plan, which was of concern to Russia.</p>

<p>"So far we can't even get an explanation of what this means, but there is no doubt that it causes additional anxiety," Russia's state-run RIA new agency quoted him as saying.</p>

<h3><strong>'This Is Not Sustainable'</strong></h3>

<p>Ahead of Saturday's two summits, Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong urged Myanmar's military rulers to take a different path and end an intensifying civil war, pressing the generals to abide by their commitment to follow ASEAN's five-point consensus peace plan.</p>

<p>The conflict pits Myanmar's well-equipped military against a loose alliance of ethnic minority rebel groups and an armed resistance movement that has been gaining ground and testing the generals' ability to govern.</p>

<p>The junta has largely ignored the ASEAN-promoted peace effort, and the 10-member bloc has hit a wall as all sides refuse to enter into dialogue.</p>

<p>"We see the instability, the insecurity, the deaths, the pain that is being caused by the conflict," Wong told reporters.</p>

<p>"My message from Australia to the regime is, this is not sustainable for you or for your people."</p>

<p>An estimated 2.6 million people have been displaced by fighting. The junta has been condemned for excessive force in its air strikes on civilian areas and accused of atrocities, which it has dismissed as Western disinformation.</p>

<p>ASEAN issued a communique on Saturday, two days after its top diplomats met, stressing it was united behind its peace plan for Myanmar, saying it was confident in its special envoy's resolve to achieve "an inclusive and durable peaceful resolution" to the conflict.</p>

<p>It condemned violence against civilians and urged all sides in Myanmar to cease hostilities.</p>

<p>ASEAN welcomed unspecified practical measures to reduce tension in the South China Sea and prevent accidents and miscalculations, while urging all stakeholders to halt actions that could complicate and escalate disputes.</p>

<p>The ministers described North Korea's missile tests as worrisome developments and urged peaceful resolutions to the conflicts in Ukraine, as well as Gaza, expressing concern over the dire humanitarian situation and "alarming casualties" there.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NASA is grappling with an impending congestion at the International Space Station (ISS) due to recent delays and technical issues involving SpaceX and Boeing, as the space agency works to restore smooth traffic flow to and from the orbiting laboratory, New York Times reported.</p>

<p>NASA officials indicated on Friday that the next month is likely to see increased traffic at the ISS. This comes after a period of operational challenges that had temporarily stalled the agency's ability to transport astronauts. However, NASA officials have framed the situation positively, describing the expected congestion as a sign of progress.</p>

<p>Ken Bowersox, associate administrator of NASA's space operations mission directorate, remarked during a news conference, "We have never had so many vehicles and so many options. It complicates our lives, but in a really good way." This optimism comes despite a series of recent setbacks that have tested NASA's capacity to manage space station operations effectively.</p>

<p>The ISS has seen unusual activity recently, including propulsion issues with a new Boeing spacecraft and an emergency sheltering of astronauts due to debris from a defunct Russian satellite. Additionally, technical problems with spacesuits led to the cancellation of several spacewalks, and SpaceX faced a rocket failure that delayed its ability to transport astronauts.</p>

<p>One of the most pressing issues involves Boeing's Starliner spacecraft, which is currently docked at the ISS with two NASA astronauts on board. Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore, who have been on an extended mission due to technical problems with Starliner's propulsion system, are expected to return to Earth soon. Their mission was originally scheduled to be shorter, but engineers have needed additional time to resolve issues with the spacecraft's propulsion system, which had malfunctioned during its approach for docking in June, according to New York Times.</p>

<p>The plan moving forward is to prioritise the return of the Starliner spacecraft to free up one of the two docking ports at the ISS. Dana Weigel, the programme manager for the ISS at NASA, explained, "I've got to take off a vehicle. And so our plan is undock Starliner first to free up a port."</p>

<p>The next SpaceX Crew Dragon mission, Crew-9, is set to launch no earlier than August 18. This mission, which will carry four astronauts for a six-month stay at the space station, will be the ninth such mission for SpaceX. Following Crew-9's arrival, another Crew Dragon currently docked at the ISS will return four of the station's current occupants to Earth, completing their six-month mission.</p>

<p>Before the Crew-9 launch, NASA and Boeing officials are focused on resolving issues with Starliner. Recent assessments revealed that the spacecraft's propulsion system experienced overheating issues, which affected Teflon seals and constrained propellant flow. Tests showed that the buildup of heat in the thrusters caused these seals to bulge, impacting performance. Additionally, degradation in the helium system's seals, caused by exposure to propellant vapour, was discovered in a test version of the Starliner service module.</p>

<p>The challenges with Starliner are part of a broader set of issues for Boeing, which has faced scrutiny over the spacecraft's performance. Despite these setbacks, NASA and Boeing officials have assured that there is no danger to the astronauts on board. The ongoing analysis aims to ensure that future missions will be free of such problems.</p>

<p>Steve Stich, programme manager of NASA's commercial crew programme, and Mark Nappi, who leads the Starliner efforts at Boeing, reported progress in understanding the spacecraft's propulsion problems. They are hopeful that the technical fixes will address the issues effectively.</p>

<p>In addition to the Starliner challenges, SpaceX encountered its own problems. On July 11, during a routine launch of Starlink satellites, the second stage of a Falcon 9 rocket suffered a liquid oxygen leak, resulting in the satellites being deployed into the wrong orbit. This incident marked the first failure of a Falcon 9 rocket since 2016, breaking a streak of over 300 successful flights.</p>

<p>SpaceX has since identified the issue as related to a pressure sensor line used for liquid oxygen. The company is working on a short-term fix, which involves removing the problematic line and sensor. On Thursday, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) granted SpaceX permission to resume Falcon 9 launches after concluding that the failure did not pose a public safety risk. The next Falcon 9 launch is scheduled for Saturday at 12:21 a.m. Eastern Time from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station.</p>

<p>NASA is coordinating closely with SpaceX to ensure that the design fixes for the rocket will ensure the safety of astronauts on future Crew Dragon missions. The agency's efforts are focused on addressing any technical issues to avoid further delays in astronaut transport.</p>

<p>As for Starliner, the spacecraft faces a critical test this weekend. Its thrusters will undergo a brief firing test to evaluate their performance and check if helium leaks have worsened. A successful test will lead to a final review by NASA before approving Starliner's return to Earth, New York Times reported.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a shocking incident, a&nbsp;small plane crashed into the front yard of a Utah home, where a family was inside.&nbsp;The incident happened at approximately 3:55 p.m. on Wednesday, July 24, when a twin-engine Piper PA-34 plane suddenly crashed onto the front lawn of Anthony Baugh's residence, shocking witnesses in the area, <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/07/26/us-news/small-plane-crashes-on-utah-familys-front-lawn-video/">New York Post </a></em>reported.</p>

<p>CCTV footage of the incident showed the plane slamming onto the lawn and skidding towards the porch before stopping shy of it.&nbsp;Following the crash, multiple concerned neighbours were seen rushing towards the scene to assist and aid those involved.&nbsp;</p>

<p></p>

<p>Notably, Mr Baugh was not at his residence when the crash happened. He got an urgent call from his wife, who described the shocking scene unfolding before her eyes prompting him to rush home from work.&nbsp;He also watched footage of the crash from his home security camera on his phone.</p>

<p>''It immediately left me in a panic trying to get home as fast as I could,'' he&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fox13now.com/news/local-news/pilot-passenger-mildly-injured-after-crashing-into-front-yard-in-roy-no-structures-damaged" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">told<em> Fox 13</em></a><em>.</em></p>

<p>According to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the two occupants were aboard the aircraft when it crashed in front of the residential home. The identities of the individuals involved have not been disclosed and they are currently being treated for minor injuries. One home was damaged as were some trees in the area, according to Roy City Fire &amp; Rescue.&nbsp;There were no other injuries other than the occupants of the plane.</p>

<p>Their neighbour Pat Bouwhuis told Fox 13 she ''thought a house had exploded'' when she heard the crash.</p>

<p>The sudden plane crash left Anthony Baugh's family, particularly his wife and children who witnessed it, shaken and traumatized.&nbsp;</p>

<p>''My eldest one, he was shaken up a little bit, we had some family members that passed away in a plane crash a few years ago so it was a little nerve-racking,'' he explained.</p>

<p>The crash is being investigated by the police department, the Federal Aviation Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bangladesh said three student leaders had been taken into custody for their own safety after the government blamed their protests against civil service job quotas for days of deadly nationwide unrest.</p>

<p>Students Against Discrimination head Nahid Islam and two other senior members of the protest group were Friday forcibly discharged from hospital and taken away by a group of plainclothes detectives.</p>

<p>The street rallies organised by the trio precipitated a police crackdown and days of running clashes between officers and protesters that killed at least 201 people, according to an AFP tally of hospital and police data.</p>

<p>Islam earlier this week told AFP he was being treated at the hospital in the capital Dhaka for injuries police inflicted on him during an earlier round of detention.</p>

<p>Police had initially denied that Islam and his two colleagues were taken into custody before home minister Asaduzzaman Khan confirmed it to reporters late on Friday.</p>

<p>"They themselves were feeling insecure. They think that some people were threatening them," he said.</p>

<p>"That's why we think for their own security they needed to be interrogated to find out who was threatening them. After the interrogation, we will take the next course of action."</p>

<p>Khan did not confirm whether the trio had been formally arrested.</p>

<p>Days of mayhem last week saw the torching of government buildings and police posts in Dhaka, and fierce street fights between protesters and riot police elsewhere in the country.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's government deployed troops, instituted a nationwide internet blackout and imposed a curfew to restore order.</p>

<h3><strong>'Carried out raids'</strong></h3>

<p>The unrest began when police and pro-government student groups attacked street rallies organised by Students Against Discrimination that had remained largely peaceful before last week.</p>

<p>Islam, 26, the chief coordinator of Students Against Discrimination, told AFP from his hospital bed on Monday that he feared for his life.</p>

<p>He said that two days beforehand, a group of people identifying themselves as police detectives blindfolded and handcuffed him and took him to an unknown location to be tortured before he was released the next morning.</p>

<p>His colleague Asif Mahmud, also taken into custody at the hospital on Friday, told AFP earlier that he had also been detained by police and beaten at the height of last week's unrest.</p>

<p>Police have arrested at least 4,500 people since the unrest began.</p>

<p>"We've carried out raids in the capital and we will continue the raids until the perpetrators are arrested," Dhaka Metropolitan Police joint commissioner Biplob Kumar Sarker told AFP.</p>

<p>"We're not arresting general students, only those who vandalised government properties and set them on fire."</p>

<h3><strong>'I want justice'</strong></h3>

<p>Islam and other thousands of other students were protesting the June reintroduction of a scheme reserving more than half of all government jobs for certain candidates.</p>

<p>With around 18 million young Bangladeshis out of work, according to government figures, the move deeply upset graduates facing an acute jobs crisis.</p>

<p>Critics say the quota is used to stack public jobs with loyalists to Hasina's Awami League.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court cut the number of reserved jobs on Sunday but fell short of protesters' demands to scrap the quotas entirely.</p>

<p>Hasina has ruled Bangladesh since 2009 and won her fourth consecutive election in January after a vote without genuine opposition.</p>

<p>Her government is accused by rights groups of misusing state institutions to entrench its hold on power and stamp out dissent, including the extrajudicial killing of opposition activists.</p>

<p>On Saturday Hasina again surveyed some of the damage caused during the unrest.</p>

<p>"This does is nothing but cripple our economy and turn us into a nation of beggars," she told reporters.</p>

<p>"I want justice."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The opening ceremony of the Paris Olympics 2024 has courted a massive controversy over the drag queen-themed apparent parody of "The Last Supper," a mural painting by Renaissance artist Leonardo da Vinci of Jesus and his apostles. Soon after videos of the performance were shared on social media, they drew flak from all quarters.</p>

<p>On Friday, as part of the opening ceremony of the Olympics, several performances shed light on France's history and culture.</p>

<p>At the ceremony, a group of around 18 performers struck poses behind a long table, with the Seine River and Eiffel Tower placed in the background. Among them were three familiar Drag Race France queens, the New York Post reported.</p>

<p>In the centre, an ornately dressed woman was seen donning a large silver headdress, resembling a halo depicted in Jesus' paintings. While smiling, the woman made a heart shape with her hands as all of them looked at the camera before breaking away in a choreographed routine.</p>

<p>Later, the participants stormed the stage for an impromptu fashion show as they swayed along the sidelines.</p>

<p>Further adding to this "absurdity," a massive serving tray revealed a scantily dressed man, who was painted head to toe in sparkling blue.</p>

<p>A post on the official X handle of the Olympic Games stated that the "interpretation of the Greek God Dionysus makes us aware of the absurdity of violence between human beings."</p>

<p>"The Paris Olympics is under fire for including a *child* in their hyper-s*xualized, blasphemous rendition of The Last Supper. Instead of bringing people together, the planners of the event apparently wanted to mock the religion of 2.4 billion people," one user wrote.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US presidential race between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump is incredibly close, showed a new media poll, revealing a surge in support for Harris among non-white voters and a significant rise in enthusiasm among Democrats for her campaign.</p>

<p>In a head-to-head matchup, Trump maintains a slight lead, garnering 49 per cent of the vote compared to 47 per cent for Harris, according to the Wall Street Journal poll.</p>

<p>However, it is worth noting that this falls within the poll's margin of error, which is plus or minus 3.1 percentage points. Previously, Trump had a six-point advantage over President Joe Biden before he withdrew from the race and endorsed Harris, Xinhua news agency reported.</p>

<p>When other independent and third-party candidates, like Robert F. Kennedy Jr., were included in the ballot test, Harris received 45 per cent of the support, compared to 44 per cent for Trump. Kennedy had the backing of only 4 per cent of respondents, and 5 per cent remained undecided.</p>

<p>In the previous poll, Biden trailed Trump by six points in this multi-candidate scenario, as indicated by the poll results.</p>

<p>Both the Harris and Trump campaigns are currently engaged in a race to establish a clearer public image of the vice president. The poll indicates that Harris is viewed favourably by 46 per cent of respondents and unfavourably by 52 per cent, marking her most positive result in the poll during this election cycle. This marks her highest favorability rating in the poll during the current election cycle.</p>

<p>According to the poll results, Trump is perceived as more capable than Harris in handling immigration, the economy, foreign relations, and crime. However, Harris holds an advantage of 51 per cent to 33 per cent when it comes to dealing with abortion.</p>

<p>The two received similar ratings when it came to caring about people like the respondents.</p>

<p>The poll further revealed that 48 per cent of respondents believe that, at the age of 78, Trump is too old to serve as President, while only 2 per cent expressed the same concern about the 59-year-old Harris.</p>

<p>Furthermore, 46 per cent of respondents believed that Harris possesses the right temperament to be President, compared to only 38 per cent who held the same belief about Trump.</p>

<p>The survey highlighted that many voters are still in the process of familiarising themselves with the potential vice presidential running mates being considered by Harris. It is expected that she will need to announce her pick by August 7 to meet the deadline set by her party for a virtual nomination process.</p>

<p>The Wall Street Journal poll, conducted by Bocian of the firm GBAO and Lee of Fabrizio Lee, involved interviews with 1,000 registered voters from July 23-25. The margin of error for the entire sample is plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Seven out of 10 French high-speed trains will run Saturday on three key routes, a day after saboteurs paralysed much of the train network as the Olympic Games started in Paris.</p>

<p>No immediate claim of responsibility was made for the coordinated overnight arson attacks on cabling boxes at junctions strategically picked out north, southwest and east of the French capital where the Olympics opening ceremony was staged on Friday night.</p>

<p>Rail workers thwarted an attempt to destroy safety equipment on a fourth line in what the SNCF rail company called a "massive attack".</p>

<p>"On the North, Brittany and South-West high-speed lines, seven out of 10 trains on average will run with delays of one to two hours," SNCF said in a statement.</p>

<p>It said SNCF "agents worked all night under difficult conditions in the rain to allow to improve traffic on high-speed lines affected by the acts of sabotage.</p>

<p>"At this stage, traffic will remain disrupted on Sunday on the North axis and should improve on the Atlantic axis for weekend returns," it said.</p>

<p>"Customers will be contacted by text message and email to confirm the running of their trains."</p>

<p>SNCF estimated that about 250,000 passengers were affected on Friday. Junior transport minister Patrice Vergriete said 800,000 could face the fallout over the three days.</p>

<p>The coordinated attacks were staged at 4:00 am (0200 GMT) early Friday.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[While Tuesday's incident at Manchester Airport may not have the severity of some past events, it still is an example of systemic racism and the West's inflated self-image poisoning institutions.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-07/b9533npg_racism-_625x300_27_July_24.jpg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>Earlier this week, a disturbing video <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/violent-video-of-manchester-airport-police-assault-triggers-protests-6184761">emerged from the UK</a>, in which a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/uk-police-officer-filmed-kicking-and-stomping-on-mans-head-at-airport-probe-on-6184212/amp/1">young Asian boy</a> could be seen being kicked and punched while he lay defenceless on the floor of Manchester Airport. Most reports said that three Greater Manchester police officers were first assaulted - one of whom was left with a broken nose - and that this led to the police response. One officer has been suspended after the incident - which, by the way, the right-wing Reform Party took no time in politicising as it praised the police action.&nbsp;</p>

<p>No national outrage followed the incident, barring some feeble debate about the alleged police brutality. Had a similar act been committed by an Indian police officer, the Western media would likely have judged the entire police force, emphasising India's poor human rights records.</p>

<p>Akhmed Yakoob, the lawyer for the Asian boy, described it as police brutality against people from BAME (British Asian and minority ethnic) backgrounds. A few people took to streets to protest the police action as the incident reminded them of the George Floyd assault in 2020, which spurred the Black Lives Matter movement across the West. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Racism, discrimination, and misogyny within Britain's police forces are pervasive. Last year, after a year-long official review of London's Met Police, reviewer Baroness Casey stated, "the force suffers from institutional racism, misogyny, and homophobia", further adding that "it was time for the force not to be in denial about these deep-rooted issues''.</p>

<h2><strong>The Many Types Of Racism</strong></h2>

<p>Racism is not a feature limited to the police forces alone in the UK. Several recent official reports have highlighted racism in some premier British institutions, including the BBC, the armed forces, and various government offices. All of these are controlled primarily by White males. For non-Whites, reaching top positions in these institutions is next to impossible, and if at all that happens, it's mostly just tokenism. Greg Dyke, former director-general of the BBC, famously said in 2001 that the media house was "hideously White", highlighting the lack of diversity within its workforce at the time. His comment sparked a broader conversation about the representation of ethnic minorities in British media and other institutions. True, some improvements have been made since then, but not a lot.</p>

<p><strong><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://sports.ndtv.com/football/racism-reducing-my-desire-to-play-football-brazils-vinicius-junior-5311569">Also Read |&nbsp;Racism Reducing My Desire To Play Football: Brazil's Vinicius Junior</a></strong></p>

<p>There is overt racism too, which comes alive during the 10 months of the football season (August-May) across Europe. I am a football fanatic and an avid follower of European club football; not only have I witnessed racism first-hand in and outside stadiums, but I have also been at the receiving end of it. After being called a "Paki" or a "chutney" on occasion, &nbsp;I now prefer to watch matches on TV.</p>

<p>Even so, there is little guarantee you will be spared because you are watching the match in the company of your White mates. But even as I say so, I've managed to escape the worst of racism. Think of those Black players who suffer humiliation and inhuman treatment from fans of rival teams on a daily basis. Some call them "monkeys", and throw bananas at them.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Colonialism, Slavery and Subjugation</strong></h2>

<p>White, western racism has persisted for decades, even centuries. The Western hemisphere calls itself 'civilised', a notion perpetuated by media, writers, academics and leaders, who position themselves as champions of bringing 'civilisation' to third-world countries. One form of that 'civilising' role was donned by religious missionaries long ago, who believed the people outside of Christendom needed to be "led to the right path".</p>

<p>Historical figures like Rudyard Kipling and Winston Churchill have espoused these ideas. The former's The White Man's Burden promoted this self-espoused 'colonial duty' to civilise colonised societies. Churchill once said, "I do not admit for instance, that a great wrong has been done to the Red Indians of America, or the black people of Australia... by the fact that a stronger race, a higher grade race... has come in and taken their place." Churchill, who is seen in India as racist and imperialist, is Britain's - more specifically England's national hero.</p>

<p><strong><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/with-kamala-harris-democrats-would-bet-against-us-history-of-sexism-racism-6157603">Also Read |&nbsp;With Kamala Harris, Democrats Would Bet Against US History Of Sexism, Racism</a></strong></p>

<p>More recently, Viktor Orban, the Prime Minister of Hungary, said in 2019, "We are the guardians of a civilisation that has been developed over millennia... We are the ones who have built the modern world, who have built the West, who have built the European Union. We are the ones who have written the rulebook of the world." The statement does not only reflect Hungarian Prime Minister's arrogance but also exposes him as an ignorant fool. Sadly, this arrogance is endemic in the West.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Western Hypocrisy&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p>In this same context, the speech made by US President George W. Bush in November 2003 during his official visit to London was interesting. "The United States and Great Britain share a mission: to bring the values of freedom and democracy to the world... We will not be deterred. We will not be defeated. We will bring freedom and civilisation to the world," he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bush's comments came several months after the invasion of Iraq in March 2003. The two "civilised" nations, the US and the UK, had invaded a faraway country to civilise its people by implanting democracy there and imparting Western values. However, getting rid of weapons of mass destruction was the rationale presented to the world. The entire Western media jumped on to the 'civilising' narrative, completely disregarding their duty to question the real reason behind the invasion. Ultimately, no weapons of mass destruction were found. It was all a pack of lies, spread by the "most civilised country in the world".</p>

<h2><strong>'The Greatest, The Most Powerful'</strong></h2>

<p>Who can forget the gaffe by President Donald Trump - the commander in chief of the world's deadliest military force and the President of the most powerful country - when he mistakenly claimed to have met the "President of the Virgin Islands", not realising it was a U.S. territory? How can we expect Trump to know about the ancient civilisations of India, China, Syria and Egypt, when he isn't sure of the geography of his own country? And yet, Trump once confidently stated in 2017, "We are the greatest country in the world. If you think about it, we are the greatest. We're the greatest because of our values, because of our principles, because of our Constitution, because of our system of government, because of our economic system. We're the greatest because we're a beacon of hope for the rest of the world."</p>

<p>The West's superiority complex and its fervid need to civilise others continue to shape attitudes and policies. The challenge is to recognise and dismantle these deep-seated prejudices. While Tuesday's incident at Manchester Airport may not have the severity of some past events, it still is an example of systemic racism and the West's inflated self-image poisoning institutions. These issues require continuous scrutiny and action to foster a more equitable society. Indeed, several laws have been passed in the UK and elsewhere in Europe, and things have got better compared to where we stood in the 20th century. But legislation is barely enough. One needs to change the mindset, right from schools and police forces to media houses and private institutions.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Elon Musk's former partner Grimes recently spoke out in support of the billionaire's estranged transgender daughter Vivian Jenna Wilson. "I love and am forever endlessly proud of Vivian," the musician posted on X (formerly Twitter) on Thursday. This came after Mr Musk's daughter accused the entrepreneur of being a cruel and absent father. She strongly denied Mr Musk's recent comments about her, including a claim that the so-called "woke mind virus" had killed his "son". She also sought to clear the air over her gender, saying that she legally recognises as a woman and doesn't concern herself with the other's opinion.&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">I love and am forever endlessly proud of Vivian.</p>
— ?????? ⏳ (@Grimezsz) <a href="https://twitter.com/Grimezsz/status/1816664745426190640?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 26, 2024</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>The world's richest man had claimed in a recent interview that during the pandemic, he was tricked into signing documents for "one of his older boys" <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/elon-musk-disowned-by-transgender-daughter-hes-desperate-for-attention-6193039">Vivian Jenna Wilson</a>. He said that his "son is dead" and also referred to gender-reassignment surgery as "child mutilation and sterilisation".&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I was tricked into doing this. I lost my son, essentially. They call it 'deadnaming' for a reason. The reason they call it 'deadnaming' is because your son is dead," Mr Musk said, claiming that the experience set him on a mission to combat what he described as the "woke mind virus".</p>

<p>"I vowed to destroy the woke mind virus after that. And we're making some progress," he added.</p>

<p>Responding to this, Ms Wilson said that she "disowned" him and not the other way round. She shared a screenshot of Mr Musk's post in which he claimed that his son was born "gay and slightly autistic" and said "entire thing was made up".&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Like, literally none of this ever happened. Ever. I don't even know where he got this from. My best guess is that he went to the Milo Yiannopoulis school of gay stereotypes, just picked some at random and said "eh- good enough" in a last-ditch attempt to garner sympathy points when he is so obviously in the wrong even in his own fu**ing story," she wrote.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Further, the 20-year-old denied that she ever picked jackets for her father. "I was most certainly not calling them "fabulous" because literally what the f**k. I did not use the word fabulous when I was four because once again I would like to reiterate... I was four," she added.</p>

<p>She also claimed she did not have her father by her side when she was growing up. "This entire thing is completely made up and there's a reason for this. He doesn't know what I was like as a child because he quite simply wasn't there, and in the little time that he was I was relentlessly harassed for my femininity and queerness. Obviously he can't say that, so I've been reduced to a happy little stereotype f*g-ing along to use at his discretion. I think that says alot about how he views queer people and children in general," said Ms Wilson.</p>

<p>"I'm legally recognized as a woman in the state of California and I don't concern myself with the opinions of those who are below me. Obviously Elon can't say the same because in a ketamine-fueled haze, he's desperate for attention and validation from an army of degenerate red-pilled incels and pick-mes who are quick to give it to him," she added.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A spacecraft launched last year will slingshot back around Earth and the Moon next month in a high-stakes, world-first manoeuvre as it pinballs its way through the Solar System to Jupiter.</p>

<p>The European Space Agency's Juice probe blasted off in April 2023 on a mission to discover whether Jupiter's icy moons Ganymede, Callisto, and Europa are capable of hosting extra-terrestrial life in their vast, hidden oceans.</p>

<p>The uncrewed six-tonne spacecraft is currently 10 million kilometres (six million miles) from Earth.</p>

<p>But it will fly back past the Moon and then Earth on August 19-20, using their gravity boosts to save fuel on its winding, eight-year odyssey to Jupiter.</p>

<p>Staff at the ESA's space operations centre in Darmstadt, Germany began preparing for the complicated manoeuvre this week.</p>

<p>Juice is expected to arrive at Jupiter's system in July 2031.</p>

<p>It will take the scenic route. NASA's Europa Clipper spacecraft is scheduled to launch this October yet beat Juice to Jupiter's moons by a year.</p>

<p>Long and winding road</p>

<p>Juice is taking the long way around in part because the Ariane 5 rocket used to launch the mission was not powerful enough for a straight shot to Jupiter, which is roughly 800 million kilometres away.</p>

<p>Without an enormous rocket, sending Juice straight to Jupiter would require 60 tonnes of onboard propellant -- and Juice has just three tonnes, according to the ESA.</p>

<p>"The only solution is to use gravitational assists," Arnaud Boutonnet, the ESA's head of analysis for the mission, told AFP.</p>

<p>By flying close to planets, spacecrafts can take advantage of their gravitational pull, which can change its course, speed it up or slow it down.</p>

<p>Many other space missions have used planets for gravity boosts, but next month's Earth-Moon flyby will be a "world first", the ESA said.</p>

<p>It will be the first "double gravity assist manoeuvre" using boosts from two worlds in succession, the agency said.</p>

<p>Juice will cross 750 kilometres above the Moon on August 19, before shooting past our home planet the following day.</p>

<p>The probe will leave Earth at a speed of "3.3 kilometres a second -- instead of three kilometres if we had not added the Moon", Boutonnet said.</p>

<p>As Juice whizzes past Earth and the Moon, it will use the opportunity to snap photos and test out its many instruments.</p>

<p>Down on Earth, some will be taking photos right back. Some lucky amateur sky gazers, armed with telescopes or powerful binoculars, may even be able to spot Juice as it passes over Southeast Asia.</p>

<p>- 'Plate of spaghetti' -</p>

<p>The move has been carefully calculated for years, but it will be no walk in the park.</p>

<p>"We are aiming for a mouse hole," Boutonnet emphasised.</p>

<p>The slightest error during its slingshot around the Moon would be amplified by Earth's gravity, potentially creating a small risk that the spacecraft could enter and burn up in Earth's atmosphere.</p>

<p>The team on the ground will be closely observing the spacecraft -- and have 12-18 hours to calculate and adjust its trajectory if needed, Boutonnet said.</p>

<p>He mostly feared a scenario in which the amount of course corrections needed would erase the gains from the double-world slingshot, meaning they would be "doing all this for nothing".</p>

<p>If all goes well, Juice will head back out into interplanetary space -- for a little while at least.</p>

<p>It will first head to Venus for another boost in 2025.</p>

<p>Juice will even fly past Earth twice more -- once in 2026, then a final time in 2029 before finally setting off towards Jupiter.</p>

<p>Then comes the really tricky part.</p>

<p>Once Juice arrives at Jupiter, it will use a whopping 35 gravitational assists as its bounces around the planet's ocean moons.</p>

<p>During this phase, the probe's trajectory looks like "a real plate of spaghetti", Boutonnet said.</p>

<p>"What we're doing with the Earth-Moon system is a joke in comparison," he added.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US presidential candidate Donald Trump falsely accused election rival Kamala Harris of being an anti-Semite who plans to allow the murder of newborn babies, in a speech meant to rally religious supporters Friday that quickly went off the rails.</p>

<p>The vice president, who is married to a Jewish man, has gained ground on Trump in polling since she replaced Joe Biden on the top of the Democratic ticket just days ago.</p>

<p>Former Republican president Trump dedicated much of his address at a religious convention in southern Florida to assailing Harris's record as a senator and as Biden's number two, but many of his attacks were smears untethered to reality.</p>

<p>Explaining why 59-year-old Harris had skipped Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyau's speech to the US Congress on Wednesday to instead honour a prior commitment, Trump accused her, baselessly, of anti-Semitism.</p>

<p>"She doesn't like Jewish people. She doesn't like Israel. That's the way it is, and that's the way it's always going to be. She's not going to change," he said.</p>

<p>The remark -- coupled with his claim that Harris "is totally against the Jewish people" in North Carolina on Wednesday -- marked an escalation in Trump's incendiary rhetoric, days after his campaign said an attempt on his life had given him a focus on unity.</p>

<p>The hour-long Friday speech, hosted by hard-right Turning Point Action, raised legitimate questions over Harris's previous statements on policing, immigration and the environment that placed her to the left of current Biden administration policy.</p>

<p>But it was marked by hyperbole and falsehood.</p>

<h3><strong>'Execute the baby'</strong></h3>

<p>Trump -- a convicted felon who is fighting multiple further indictments -- suggested baselessly that the Justice Department and FBI were "rounding up" Christians and anti-abortion activists and throwing them in jail for their "religious beliefs."</p>

<p>He also called Biden's decision to exit the election campaign a "coup" by Democrats and said America was a "laughing stock."</p>

<p>But he saved his darkest vitriol for Harris, calling her a "bum" and a failed vice president who had rejected federal judges for being Catholic and would appoint "hardcore Marxists" to the Supreme Court.</p>

<p>He also accused her falsely of wanting to force doctors to give chemical castration drugs to children and suggested she might cheat to win in November.</p>

<p>"If Kamala Harris has her way, they will have a federal law for abortion, to rip the baby out of the womb in the eighth, ninth month and even after birth -- execute the baby after birth," he claimed, in perhaps his most egregious calumny.</p>

<p>78-year-old Trump, now the oldest major-party nominee in history, is scrambling to reorient an election against someone two decades his junior, having expected to face an 81-year-old incumbent Biden beset by concerns over infirmity.</p>

<p>Just last week, the former reality TV star was in cruise control as he accepted a hero's welcome -- and the official presidential nomination -- at the Republican convention in Milwaukee.</p>

<h3><strong>Crowning glory</strong></h3>

<p>His crowning glory came a week after a gunman nearly killed him at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania -- an extraordinary incident that Trump vowed Friday to commemorate with "a big and beautiful" new rally in the town, although he did not give a date.</p>

<p>Seeking to become the first female president in US history, Harris is tasked with rapidly assembling a campaign against an opponent who has been in near permanent reelection mode since he became president in 2016.</p>

<p>Trump's predecessor Barack Obama pledged support for Harris earlier Friday, as polls showed her closing the gap that Trump had built over Biden to make the race a statistical tie.</p>

<p>A top California prosecutor and senator before being elected the country's first female and first Black and South Asian vice president, Harris has highlighted Trump's criminal conviction and what she said Thursday is a Republican attack on "hard-fought freedoms" in US society.</p>

<p>Democrats leapt on a Trump campaign announcement late Thursday that cast into doubt whether he will debate Harris.</p>

<p>"It shows that he's afraid," Transport Secretary Pete Buttigieg, a major Harris campaign advocate, told MSNBC.</p>

<p>"It shows that he knows that if the two of them are on a stage together, it's not going to end well for him."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Kamala Harris has reinvigorated the Democratic ticket and inspired the voters they need most: women, African-Americans and youth. But it's not all smooth sailing.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kamala Harris has reinvigorated the Democratic ticket and inspired the voters they need most: women, African-Americans and youth. But it's not all smooth sailing.</p>

<p>Following Joe Biden's withdrawal from the presidential race, Kamala Harris is poised to become the first woman of colour to run as presidential candidate of a major political party in the US.</p>

<p>As the youngest presidential nominee since Barack Obama, Harris, 59, is comparatively youthful compared with Biden, 81, and Donald Trump, 78.</p>

<p>Her age is likely to make her more appealing and relatable for younger Americans. Polling has already found that 82 percent of voters under 30 - more than any other age group - thought Biden was too old to be an effective president.</p>

<p>Since Israel's invasion of Gaza, Biden has also increasingly been losing the youth vote, with many disillusioned with his stance on the crisis. (Research has demonstrated a stark generation gap around views on Israel and Palestine, with Americans under 30 much more likely to sympathise with Palestinians.)</p>

<p>The heads of the US's most prominent Black sororities and fraternities, known as the 'Divine Nine', have already begun planning a massive voter organisation effort to support Harris. The organisations comprise more than two million young Black people - and their support could represent a significant political advantage.</p>

<p>Though still early days, it's clear Harris has already reinvigorated the Democratic ticket and re-energised the voters they need most: women, African Americans and, especially, young people.</p>

<p>It is important for Harris to court this demographic - and ensure they actually turn up to polling booths in November. Most younger voters - especially women and people of colour - vote Democrat, but only half of Americans aged 18-29 actually voted in 2020.</p>

<p><strong>'Brat' memes and coconut emojis</strong></p>

<p>Just hours after Biden's announcement, Harris received resounding endorsement from the often-cynical Gen Z and younger Millennials.</p>

<p>When British popstar of the summer Charli XCX tweeted "Kamala IS Brat" on Sunday, it instantly went viral. (To clarify, Brat is Charli XCX's latest chart-topping album, released last month. Many fans have since adopted the "brat" identity, which is "to embrace your messiness and vulnerability - being your own authentic self.")</p>

<p>It's a trend currently dominating queer and Gen Z pop culture, as a "brat summer" is declared in the Northern hemisphere and those in the South enjoy a "brat winter".</p>

<p>Even before Harris became the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, this Kamala x Brat crossover had been building for weeks online, through memes and TikToks created by fan communities.</p>

<p>Memes can make politics more entertaining and accessible to younger voters and profoundly influence public perceptions of political leaders, especially during election campaigns.</p>

<p>The adoption of Harris as a "brat" is indicative of her youth appeal. Reading the room, the Harris campaign has embraced this trend, changing its official twitter backdrop to a "Brat green" to mimic Charli XCX's album cover</p>

<p>Coconut emojis and memes have likewise flooded social media platforms to demonstrate support.</p>

<p>This trend was inspired by a remark made by Harris at a White House event last May.</p>

<p>"My mother used to - she would give us a hard time sometimes, and she would say to us, 'I don't know what's wrong with you young people. You think you just fell out of a coconut tree?' while laughing. Then, in a serious tone, 'you exist in the context of all in which you live and what came before you'," she said.</p>

<p>After going viral at the time (while simultaneously being mocked by conservatives) this quote has resurfaced with greater popularity in recent days. It resonates with younger voters who admire Harris' authenticity. Coconuts have since become a rallying cry for supporters, again demonstrating her youth appeal.</p>

<p><strong>Harris must contend with misogynoir</strong></p>

<p>Yet politics can be a hostile game, especially for those who do not fit the white male status quo.</p>

<p>Women politicians - especially leaders - have historically experienced sexism and misogyny from their peers, the public and the media.</p>

<p>The mainstream media plays a key role in shaping cultural and social attitudes on gender norms, roles and stereotypes. It wields the power to influence public opinion.</p>

<p>The Australian media did just this in its portrayal of first woman prime minister Julia Gillard, who endured an unprecedented quantity and ferocity of criticism during her term.</p>

<p>Hillary Clinton, who came closest to breaking the highest glass ceiling in the US, likewise endured an onslaught of sexism and misogyny from the media, as well as the public and especially Trump.</p>

<p>Scholars analysing the 2016 presidential election found that television coverage favoured Trump and demonised Clinton. Print and online articles were often sexist and targeted her integrity.</p>

<p>And sexist stereotypes spread on social media (including memes emphasising female physical traits to depict Clinton as weak, ill or unattractive, and conversely memes highlighting 'anti-feminine traits' such as dishonesty or untrustworthiness.)</p>

<p>Research has found conservative media outlets with more traditional and right-wing audiences were more likely to be sexist in the coverage of Clinton, while sexism was a "significant predictor" of voter choice at the 2016 election, especially for white voters.</p>

<p>What, then, will Harris likely endure from more traditional media and the opposition during what is gearing up to be a divisive and vicious campaign season?</p>

<p>If her treatment as vice presidential nominee during the 2020 election is any indication, Harris will likely be subjected to unprecedented levels of misogyny and racism.</p>

<p>One study examining gendered abuse of women political candidates at the 2020 election found that a majority was directed at Harris.</p>

<p>This included sexualised narratives (that she "slept her way to the top"), transphobic narratives (that she's secretly a man), racist narratives (questioning her citizenship and claiming she is not "Black enough" or "Indian enough").</p>

<p>This is referred to as "semiotic violence", where words are weaponised to attack women politicians to silence and ultimately deny them their civic rights.</p>

<p>As a Black and Indian woman, Harris faces what has been termed "misogynoir" - a specific kind of racist misogyny aimed at Black women, who are frequently stereotyped as being "angry" and hypersexualised.</p>

<p>Media coverage of Harris' 2020 vice presidential nomination unduly focused on her gender and race, with one quarter of news articles including a racist or sexist stereotype (though largely due to quoting Trump's ad hominem attacks).</p>

<p>The "angry Black woman" stereotype was most prevalent in this coverage, with Harris portrayed as "mean", "nasty" and "mad".</p>

<p><strong>Republican attacks intensify</strong></p>

<p>In the days since Harris became the prospective nominee, Republicans have intensified their attacks.</p>

<p>Several Republican congresspeople have called her a "DEI [Diversity, Equity and Inclusion] pick" - a coded slur implying she lacks merit and qualification.</p>

<p>Adding fuel to the fire, a 2021 clip has resurfaced of GOP vice presidential nominee JD Vance questioning Harris' leadership skills because she doesn't have biological children, referring to Democrats as a "bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable with their lives".</p>

<p>While Harris is popular among progressive young voters on social media, the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism revealed that hateful and violent speech targeting her on conservative platforms increased dramatically in the 48 hours after Biden' endorsed her as the nominee.</p>

<p>Those comments rose by 33 percent on Trump's Truth Social, 292 percent on Gab, 50 percent on Telegram and 525 percent on 4chan.</p>

<p>Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson has instructed the GOP to refrain from sexist and racist attacks against Harris and instead critique her policy record.</p>

<p>Yet the party's own presidential nominee has continued to attack Harris, labelling her "dumb" and "crazy"; perpetuating a misogynoir stereotype that Black women are irrational and less intelligent and suggesting she is unfit for leadership.</p>

<p>The 2024 US presidential election will certainly be a tale of two Americas - one defined by hatred and the past, while the other looks toward a more inclusive future.</p>

<p>Though embraced by youth culture, Harris will need nerves of steel to get through the upcoming campaign in one piece.</p>

<p>Sadly, this is what women - especially those with multiple marginalised identities - are forced to contend with for daring to enter the (masculinised) political realm.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kamala Harris is the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee. And while she will not be the Democrat's first woman nominee, nor the first person of colour, she faces the compounding challenge of being both.</p>

<p>She will be subject to a highly combative and partisan media landscape, against an opponent who pushes political rhetoric to the extreme.</p>

<p>The crucial question remains whether the media can fairly assess her qualifications for office. The answer could profoundly impact women's political participation - not only in the United States but globally.</p>

<p><strong>Sexist, racist, transphobic: Past media treatment of Harris</strong></p>

<p>The media coverage of Harris to date reflects the US' s deeply partisan landscape, with Democrat and Republican voters consuming and trusting in two nearly inverse news media landscapes.</p>

<p>While mainstream media begins to reckon with Harris as the presumptive nominee (The New York Post referred to Harris as the first 'DEI [diversity, equity and inclusion] President', so we're off to a predictable start), previous scrutiny , particularly during her past campaigns, highlights persistent themes of sexism, racism, and conspiracy theories.</p>

<p>These media onslaughts echo attacks faced by other women leaders globally.</p>

<p>In the 2020 US election, analysis of online discourse of women politicians (78 percent of which was directed at Harris) found that women faced three familiar narratives.</p>

<p>First, sexualised narratives (that Harris "slept her way to the top"). Second, transphobic narratives (insinuating that Harris was secretly a man). And, third, racist or racialised narratives (whether Harris was suitably Black or Indian enough, or even whether there was legitimacy to her citizenship and therefore eligibility for the Presidency).</p>

<p>It's important to note that while online commentary is not media reporting, the distance between the two has blurred in recent years.</p>

<p>As the line between "reporter" and "influencer" becomes less distinguishable, high-profile Republican commenters continue to post unfounded aspersions, such as Harris "isn't black...[but] part of the delusional, Democrat DEI quota".</p>

<p>Typically, these narratives then seep, largely unquestioned , into a range of traditional news and social media channels such as X, Donald Trump's Truth Social, Facebook, and political segments of conservative news programs.</p>

<p>In this environment, misinformation and disinformation thrive.</p>

<p>Americans are simultaneously more likely to turn to social media for their news and are less critical of these sources, creating an environment where the veracity of gendered and racialised statements regarding Harris is less important than their virality.</p>

<p><strong>Media's history of misogyny</strong></p>

<p>Women leaders worldwide, such as former prime ministers Julia Gillard in Australia, the UK's Theresa May (and oh-so-briefly, Liz Truss), New Zealand's Jacinda Ardern and Sanna Marin in Finland, have all endured misogynistic media portrayals.</p>

<p>Many may recall Gillard's opponent posing with "Ditch the Witch" placards, watched video compilations of Ardern responding to misogynistic questions, or the international furor Marin faced after, in Fox News' words , "going viral for [a] raunchy dance video...".</p>

<p>America's last (and first) major party woman presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton, faced a similar media environment that took misogynistic cues from her political opponent.</p>

<p>Even with the protections offered to her in her position of privilege and power, the media was seemingly only too happy to respond to Trump's calls to "lock her up" with a series of investigative reports into the Clinton Foundation, her tenure as Secretary of State, and her character.</p>

<p>As a Black and South Asian woman, Harris may face more harassment than Clinton, Gillard, Ardern or Marin, all of whom are white in white-majority countries.</p>

<p>The term misogynoir, coined by gay black feminist Moya Bailey, aptly describes a "particular brand of hatred directed at Black women in American visual and popular culture".</p>

<p>In the past, Harris' opponents have already referred to her as "aggressive", "angry" and "mean", and suggested she's a DEI nominee successful for the novelty of those identities rather than her qualifications.</p>

<p>Recent media reporting of Harris therefore continues this rich tradition i n an environment where a second Trump administration poses a grave threat to American democracy.</p>

<p><strong>The consequences of bias</strong></p>

<p>Biased media reporting contributes to real-world consequences, deterring women and marginalised people from entering politics due to fears of online harassment and myriad biases.</p>

<p>A report from the Global Institute for Women's Leadership and Women For Election in Australia found that 66 percent of women polled considered online harassment a barrier to running for office. Another 46 percent said bias against candidates from a marginalised background was an additional deterrent.</p>

<p>Young politically engaged people also see workplace safety - meaning spaces free of violence, misogyny, and other forms of discrimination - as crucial to their engagement in a political career.<br />
Long before the attempted assassination of Trump, the personal safety of political candidates has been a key concern.</p>

<p>The perception of politics as hostile and unsafe (also known as "toxic parliaments" in a new book launched by ANU's Global Institute for Women's Leadership last week) further erodes trust in political institutions and discourages young people from pursuing political careers.</p>

<p>Young women and other minority groups do not have the Secret Service protecting them when they run for local office, but those politics remain as vitriolic - and are far more accessible - than the Oval Office.</p>

<p>The conditions in which Harris obtained the nomination also matters.<br />
With an ageing President polling much lower than his opponent, a turbulent domestic economy, and the highly criticised support of Israel's war on the Palestinians, Biden's passing of the baton to Harris recalls the "glass cliff" phenomenon whereby women are promoted to leadership at "particularly precarious times" - for instance in periods of crisis, or where the chance of failure is high.<br />
These conditions matter, as they will become inextricably tied to the story of Harris' run for president and embedded into any number of explanations or justifications as to why her campaign succeeded or failed.</p>

<p><strong>Progress, or just holding the line for women?</strong></p>

<p>If Harris loses in November, Trump's administration is slated to implement and accelerate policies that undermine the rights of women and minorities on issues including abortion, immigration, education and voting rights.</p>

<p>The success of this agenda will have far-reaching consequences for the US and its allies, not to mention galvanising illiberal governments world-wide which are implementing populist, anti-rights agendas.<br />
Yet, even if Trump fails and Harris becomes the next US President, it is clear that the gendered, racialised mess of media reporting is not a blip, but a characteristic of our media landscape.</p>

<p>Both media conglomerates and everyday keyboard warriors have an effect on gendered and racialised bias among voters. Reporters, at least, should be held to minimum standards to do better.</p>

<p>Beyond reporting, the events of the last few years have revealed the vulnerabilities of the American democratic system.</p>

<p>Whether Harris succeeds or fails , she faces an enormous burden to simply hold the line, let alone prevent regression along a host of domains from social to economic.</p>

<p>It will be the work of decades to not only patch up the cracks, but to envision and build a system that is fairer, safer and more accessible for all.</p>

<p>But who is up to the task, if not women?</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few days ago, a tweet claiming responsibility for a global Microsoft outage triggered a meme fest on X. Today, the same man has returned with another viral post, this time taking credit for the chaos that ensued after three arson attacks on France's high-speed rail network. These incidents have paralysed train travel nationwide, just as Paris geared up to host the opening ceremony of the 2024 Olympics yesterday.</p>

<p>A Microsoft error had crippled Windows computers worldwide on July 19. It was later revealed that an update to the anti-virus program 'Falcon Sensor' by CrowdStrike caused the massive outage. Enter Vincent Flibustier, an X user posing as a CrowdStrike employee. Vincent broke the internet with an AI-generated photo of himself outside the CrowdStrike office, captioned, "First day at Crowdstrike, pushed a little update and taking the afternoon off."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Last night, three separate arson attacks targeting France's high-speed rail network affected train travel nationwide. The attacks' timing and perpetrators remain unclear, but their impact was immediate and devastating.</p>

<p>Mr Flibustier, following a similar routine, swiftly uploaded an AI-generated image of himself standing in front of a poster of Societe Nationale Des Chemins De Fer Francais - France's state-owned railway network. The tweet has once again gone viral with Mr Flibustier's mission accomplished.&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">First day of my new job at SNCF, did a little update on Fire alert system, taking now my afternoon off ? <a href="https://t.co/f3twAKusFh">pic.twitter.com/f3twAKusFh</a></p>
— Vincent Flibustier ? (@vinceflibustier) <a href="https://twitter.com/vinceflibustier/status/1816758155239453036?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 26, 2024</a></blockquote>

<h3><strong>What Happened In France</strong></h3>

<p>Approximately 8 lakh passengers are expected to be affected over the weekend, with a quarter of a million already impacted on Friday alone, according to SNCF. The rail network was anticipated to be particularly busy this weekend, not only because of the Olympics but also as people return from or leave for their summer holidays.</p>

<p>There were delays of 90 minutes to two hours on services between Paris and France's north and east. One major branch of the network, the line to France's southeast, was spared after rail maintenance workers surprised unauthorized individuals on site.</p>

<p>High-speed rail operator Eurostar announced that around one in four services across its network linking France, the UK, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Germany would be cancelled, including trains from Paris to London. Others would operate slower on regular lines not designed for high-speed trains.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[There does not seem to any light at the end of the tunnel for children of legal immigrants, a significantly large number of whom are Indian-Americans who came to the US as a young kid with their parents and now risk being deported back.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There does not seem to any light at the end of the tunnel for children of legal immigrants, a significantly large number of whom are Indian-Americans who came to the US as a young kid with their parents and now risk being deported back to the country where they don't know anyone because of them being aging out when they turn 21.</p>

<p>There are around 250,000 of such children of legal immigrants, a significantly large number of whom are Indians. The White House on Thursday blamed the Republicans for this legislative impasse.</p>

<p>"I talked about the bipartisan agreement that came together from the Senate where we negotiated a process to help the so-called documented Dreamers. And sadly, Republicans, and I've said this many times already at this podium today, which is that they voted it down twice. They voted it down twice,' White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters at her daily news conference.</p>

<p>Last month led by Senator Alex Padilla, Chair of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration, Citizenship, and Border Safety, and Representative Deborah Ross, a bipartisan group of 43 lawmakers called on Biden Administration to take urgent action to protect the more than 250,000 Documented Dreamers - children of long-term visa holders - who are at risk of aging out of their dependent status and are forced to self-deport if they are ineligible for another status.</p>

<p>"These young people grow up in the United States, complete their education in the American school system, and graduate with degrees from American institutions," wrote the lawmakers. "However, due to the long green-card backlog, families with approved immigrant petitions are often stuck waiting decades for permanent resident status," they said in a letter to the Biden Administration on June 13.</p>

<p>Last month, Improve The Dream, an organization representing these children of legal immigrants, met with over 100 congressional offices and senior administration officials.</p>

<p>"It is disappointing to see the lack of action and associated proposed regulations deprioritized and delayed. It is time for action and I hope President Biden and the administration see the support from this bipartisan letter and show they care about one of the most bipartisan issues in Congress and rectify the mistakes of the past,' said Dip Patel, founder of Improve The Dream comments.</p>

<p>At the same time, he expressed gratitude for the bipartisan members of Congress leading in a letter asking for urgent administrative policy improvements and who continue to champion a permanent solution through Congress.</p>

<p>"I was forced to start visa-hopping to be able to stay in this country when I was 20 years old, right before I aged out, as a junior at the University of Minnesota - Duluth. I am about to turn 27 this August. Soon, if my time visa-hopping was personified, they would be older than I was when I first came to the United States," Jefrina, currently a graduate student pursuing my MBA at the Saint Mary's University of Minnesota told PTI.</p>

<p>She came to the US from India in 2005 at the age of 7. "I arrived under a dependent H-4 visa. My family applied for permanent residency in 2010 when I was 12 years old, and I unwittingly fell in love with this country. In the last 19 years, Minnesota has undoubtedly become my home," she said.</p>

<p>"My young adult life has been a series of temporary fixes to avoid self-deportation. I graduate from my Masters program in December, and I'm yet again at the crossroads of leaving my family, pets, friends, and a myriad of unquantifiable reasons I call Minnesota my home," Jefrina said.</p>

<p>Praneetha, a Cloud Engineer based in Texas, who came to the US with her family when she was 8 years old as a dependent on her parents' work visa, and after living in the US for more than 15 years, is left with no clear path toward permanent residency and has to hop from visa to visa in order to continue living and working in the country.</p>

<p>Roshan was forced to leave the US last month. He was working with- an American semiconductor manufacturing company. He came to the US with his Mom and brother at the age of 10 on an H4 visa- he grew up in Boston and graduated from Boston College in 2021 with a degree in Economics.</p>

<p>Roshan grew up in the US for almost 16 years but aged out in 2019. He had to leave the US in June without a clear path for returning, living, and working in the only country that he has truly called home.</p>

<p>Patel said every day without action results in young adults, who have been lawfully raised in the United States by skilled workers and small business owners, to be forced to leave the country, separating them from their families and stopping their ability to contribute to the country.</p>

<p>The administration has heard countless stories and examples of American-raised and educated STEM and health care talent (which comprises 87% of all impacted by aging-out, according to Improve The Dream's survey) contributing in other countries now due to barriers in our legal immigration system.</p>

<p>"Our country is not only losing young talent who were raised and educated here, but we're also losing many of their parents, who have years of practical experience as small business owners or in fields like medicine, engineering, and artificial intelligence. The economic case is clear and the moral case is clear. It is common sense," he said in response to a question.</p>

<p>"All major administrative actions have excluded this population from receiving benefit, despite the tools for such relief being available and being used for others. Until Congress can pass the bipartisan America's Children Act, we need urgent action by the administration to prioritize this issue, which has bipartisan support from Congress and the general public, and clear economic benefit," Patel told Press Trust of India.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The world's richest one per cent increased their fortune by $42 trillion over the past decade, which is nearly 34 times more than the entire bottom 50 per cent of the world's population, according to a new analysis by Oxfam. The organisation released the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.oxfam.org/en/press-releases/top-1-percent-bags-over-40-trillion-new-wealth-during-past-decade-taxes-rich-reach">new report </a>ahead of the third meeting of G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors in Brazil. It said that the average net worth of the elite jumped by nearly $400,000 per person, after adjusting for inflation, compared to $335 for the bottom half of residents.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Inequality has reached obscene levels, and until now governments have failed to protect people and planet from its catastrophic effects," said Oxfam International's Head of Inequality Policy, Max Lawson. "The richest one percent of humanity continues to fill their pockets while the rest are left to scrap for crumbs," he added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Oxfam's research also found that the share of income of the top 1 per cent of earners in G20 countries has risen by 45 per cent over four decades while top tax rates on their incomes were cut by roughly a third.</p>

<p>"Globally, billionaires have been paying a tax rate equivalent to less than 0.5 percent of their wealth. Their fortunes has risen by an annual average of 7.1 percent over the last four decades, and an annual net wealth tax of at least 8 percent would be needed to reduce billionaires' extreme wealth. G20 countries are home to nearly four out of five of the world's billionaires," the report read.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The latest analysis comes as the advocacy group, along with several partners, is calling on G20 leaders to hike taxes on the ultra-rich.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As part of its G20 presidency, the Brazilian government recently also commissioned a study on raising taxes on the wealthy. It found that a 2 per cent minimum tax on global billionaires' wealth would yield between $200 billion and $250 billion from about 3,000 taxpayers annually.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Momentum to increase taxes on the super-rich is undeniable, and this week is the first real litmus test for G20 governments. Do they have the political will to strike a global standard that puts the needs of the many before the greed of an elite few?" Mr Lawson said.</p>

<p>Notably, Oxfam regularly issues reports highlighting global inequality and pushes for changes to start evening the playing field.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JD Vance, former US President Donald Trump's running mate, has defended his 2021 remarks where he referred to Democratic politicians as a "bunch of childless cat ladies with miserable lives".</p>

<p>JD Vance, who appeared on The Megyn Kelly Show on Friday, said "Obviously, it was a sarcastic comment. I've got nothing against cats. People are focusing so much on the sarcasm and not on the substance of what I actually said."</p>

<p>"The simple point that I made is that having children, becoming a father, becoming a mother, I really do think it changes your perspective in a pretty profound way," he told The Megyn Kelly Show.</p>

<p>"This is not about criticizing people who for various reasons don't have kids. This is about criticizing the Democratic party for becoming anti-family and anti-child," he said.</p>

<p>JD Vance had singled out Kamala Harris, now the Democratic Presidential nominee, among others during a 2021 interview and said those without offspring, especially "childless cat ladies", had no "direct stake" in the country.</p>

<p>Speaking to Tucker Carlson on Fox News, he had said the US was being run by "a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they've made and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable, too."</p>

<p>Vance's comments have drawn sexism charges ahead of the US Presidential elections that the Republicans were touted to win until President Joe Biden bowed out from the race.</p>

<p>Kamala Harris's lack of biological children has been regarded as an issue by the Republicans, but she has received support from politicians, celebrities, and from her own family. Her supporters also pointed out that no US president has ever physically given birth, since all have been men.</p>

<p>Kerstin Emhoff, the mother of Harris' stepchildren, has slammed the attacks on the Vice President as "baseless" in a statement to CNN.</p>

<p>"For over 10 years, since Cole and Ella were teenagers, Kamala has been a co-parent with Doug and I. I love our blended family and am grateful to have her in it," she said.</p>

<p>Vance, 39, was tapped by Trump days after a failed assassination attempt on the former president upended what had already been a chaotic presidential contest.</p>]]></content:encoded>

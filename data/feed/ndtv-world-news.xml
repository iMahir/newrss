       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli-American hostage Hersh Goldberg-Polin was announced dead early Sunday morning by Israeli authorities. The 23-year-old was kidnapped by Hamas militants during the October 7 attack on southern Israel.</p>

<p>Despite hopes for his safe return, his body was recovered on Saturday in the tunnels under Rafah, along with five other hostages.</p>

<p><strong>Who was Hersh Goldberg-Polin?</strong></p>

<p>Hersh Goldberg-Polin was born in Oakland, California, and immigrated to Israel with his family in 2008 at the age of seven.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Being an Israeli-American, he held dual citizenship.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He was described as a "happy-go-lucky" individual, with a deep passion for geography and travel, interests that were evident from his childhood. His bedroom was filled with atlases, globes, and National Geographic magazines. Before his abduction, Mr Goldberg-Polin had planned to embark on a round-the-world trip in December 2023, a dream that was tragically cut short by the events at the Nova music festival.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hersh Goldberg-Polin was kidnapped during Hamas' attack on the Nova music festival in southern Israel on October 7, 2023. He was among the hundreds of young festival-goers who were taken hostage during the surprise attack, which resulted in over 1,200 deaths. Mr Goldberg-Polin and his friends initially sought refuge in a bomb shelter, where he bravely attempted to throw back grenades lobbed by Hamas militants, ultimately losing his left arm from the elbow down in the process.</p>

<p>His parents, Jon Polin and Rachel Goldberg-Polin, were among the most vocal advocates for the release of hostages, including their son. They regularly met with top US officials and publicly urged the Israeli government to negotiate a deal for the hostages' release.</p>

<p>Hersh Goldberg-Polin was announced dead on September 1, after nearly a year in captivity. His body was found in Hamas-run tunnels under the city of Rafah, and it was reported that they were killed shortly before Israeli troops reached them.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>More than 60 people were battling heavy winds and rains on Sunday searching for a Russian helicopter that went missing the day before with 22 aboard in the far eastern peninsula of Kamchatka, the emergencies ministry said.</p>

<p>Seven groups of emergency rescuers, rangers and volunteers were dispatched to try to locate the Mi-8T helicopter that took off from a base near the Vachkazhets volcano, the ministry said on the Telegram messaging app.</p>

<p>The Kamchatka Peninsula, some 7,100 km (4,400 miles) east of Moscow, has been hit by a cyclone over the weekend, with rain expected to ease slightly only towards the end of Sunday, the ministry and the region's meteorology services said on Telegram.</p>

<p>"The search has not yielded any results so far," Russia's RIA state news agency reported, citing Sergei Lebedev, the emergency minister for the Kamchatka region.</p>

<p>"The road is extremely difficult. It is possible to move by foot only."</p>

<p>He added that the slopes of the mountain range in the search area are covered with dwarf pine and trees, making it impossible to use equipment.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

The image, which required four days of continuous observation and shooting, shows the moon's topography in stunning clarity and detail, revealing features that may never have been seen before.</p>

<p>Mr Mirza's photograph, which he described as the "clearest and sharpest Moon image" he has ever captured, was the result of four days of continuous observation and shooting.

<p>The photographer revealed some interesting facts about the picture in a post on Instagram.&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>Image Size: 708 GB</li>
	<li>Images Stacked: Over 81,000</li>
	<li>Composition: Merging of four different Moon phases and shadow areas to reveal detailed topography</li>
	<li>Telescope Used: Skywatcher Flextube 250p Dobsonian modified on an Equatorial Mount NEQ 6pro</li>
	<li>Cameras Used: Canon EOS 1200D (for minerals), ZWO ASI 178mc (for details)</li>
	<li>AI Involvement: None</li>
	<li>Image Resolution: 159.7 megapixels</li>
	<li>Visual Representation: Depicts the Moon as a flat disk with detailed topography</li>
</ul>

<p>The photo was posted on Reddit, where it sparked a lively discussion among enthusiasts. One user questioned whether the colours in the image were representative of actual metals and minerals on the Moon. A user clarified that the colours in the image are not what the human eye would naturally perceive.<br />
"The saturation has been increased to highlight geological differences on the lunar surface," they explained. "The reddish areas indicate high iron and feldspar content, while the blue-tinted zones have higher titanium content. Instead of viewing the colours as 'real' or 'fake,' it's more accurate to consider them as a tool that simulates what one might see with enhanced detection capabilities."</p>

<p>Another user explained simply, urging us to think like "someone who is colour-blind". Colour-blind people can't see certain colours, like red and green. To them, these colours might appear as shades of grey or be so muted that they look the same. The colours are there, but they can't see them because their eyes aren't sensitive enough. Similarly, the colours in Darya Mirza's Moon photograph are real, but our eyes might not be sensitive enough to pick them out in their natural state. The enhancements in the photo make these colours more visible.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yemen's Iran-backed Houthi rebels said Saturday they had attacked a merchant ship in the Gulf of Aden, as a multinational naval force said two missiles exploded near a Liberia-flagged vessel.</p>

<p>"The Yemeni Armed Forces carried out a military operation targeting the ship (GROTON) in the Gulf of Aden," Houthi spokesman Yahya Saree said in a televised statement.</p>

<p>He said the ship had been hit and that it was the second time it had been attacked after a similar incident on August 3.</p>

<p>The Yemeni rebels have waged a campaign against international shipping passing through the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden that they say is in solidarity with Palestinians amid the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip.</p>

<p>Earlier on Saturday, the Joint Maritime Information Centre (JMIC), run by a Western naval coalition, reported that the Groton had been targeted by two ballistic missiles when it was 130 nautical miles east of Aden.</p>

<p>The United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) agency, run by Britain's Royal Navy, said the captain reported that all crew were safe and the Groton was "proceeding to next port of call".</p>

<p>The Houthi attacks, targeting ships that they say are linked to Israel, have disrupted traffic in a maritime zone that is vital to global trade.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the US Central Command said Saturday that US forces destroyed a Houthi drone and an uncrewed surface vessel in rebel-controlled areas of Yemen over the past 24 hours.</p>

<p>"It was determined these systems presented a clear and imminent threat to US and coalition forces," CENTCOM said in a statement on X.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russia said Sunday that it had thwarted a "massive" Ukrainian drone attack by downing 158 drones across 15 regions, including two over the capital Moscow.</p>

<p>A coal-fired power plant near the city was reported hit, as was an oil refinery within the city boundaries.</p>

<p>Russia's defence ministry said most of the drones -- 122 -- were downed over the regions of Kursk, Bryansk, Voronezh and Belgorod which border Ukraine.</p>

<p>"Our defenders are repelling an attempted massive UAV attack on the territory of the Bryansk region," regional governor Aleksandr Bogomaz said.</p>

<p>The barrage comes just days after Ukraine's energy infrastructure was targeted by over 200 Russian drones and missiles in one of the biggest such attacks.</p>

<p>It is also nearly a month since Ukraine went on the offensive in Russia's Kursk region, even as Russian troops continue their steady advance in eastern Ukraine.</p>

<p>Both sides have targeted energy infrastructure since Russia began its campaign in Ukraine in February 2022.</p>

<p>A local official in the Moscow region said three drones had tried to hit the Kashira coal-fired power station.</p>

<p>"There were no victims nor damages," he said, adding that electricity was still reaching clients "correctly".</p>

<p>Russian news agencies also reported a fire at the Moscow oil refinery in Kapotnya, though mayor Sergei Sobyanin said there was "no damage or casualties".</p>

<p>In the Belgorod region, governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said: "The glass of three residential buildings in Belgorod is damaged. In one private residence, a utility building was completely destroyed."</p>

<p>On Wednesday, Ukrainian drones struck two fuel depots, setting them ablaze in southwest Russia's Rostov region and the northern Kirov region.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p data-qa="Component-Component" datatype="p">A shocking case of insurance fraud has sparked outrage online after a 42-year-old Shanghai woman, surnamed Xie, faked multiple miscarriages and forged medical documents to claim 66,200 yuan (Rs 7,83,841) in maternity insurance benefits. Notably, Xie is a high-earning employee at a foreign company with a monthly salary exceeding 30,000 yuan (Rs 3,55,215). She studied telecommunications and computer science at the university,&nbsp;reported the<em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scmp.com/news/people-culture/trending-china/article/3276484/china-woman-fakes-miscarriages-claim-us9300-insurance-cash-forged-medical-papers"> South China Morning Post.&nbsp;</a></em>Her actions have raised concerns about the maternity indemnity program, which is funded by employers to cover medical expenses and provide financial support during maternity leave.</p>

<p data-qa="Component-Component" datatype="p">During her maternity leave in December, Xie recalled her previous success in claiming insurance benefits after a genuine miscarriage two years prior. This inspired her deceitful plan, following which she leveraged her computer skills to fabricate false medical records. She created convincing documents, including a maternity certificate and discharge summary, falsely claiming hospitalisation for a miscarriage.</p>

<p data-qa="Component-Component" datatype="p">She then submitted two online insurance claims, accompanied by the forged papers, and received a total of 66,200 yuan in maternity benefits. To cover her tracks, she destroyed all related paper documents and digital records after each claim, attempting to erase any evidence of her fraudulent activities.</p>

<p data-qa="Component-Component" datatype="p">Earlier this year, she tried to fabricate another miscarriage report to claim over 40,000 yuan in maternity insurance benefits. However, her luck ran out as the claim was rejected. Interestingly, just a month later in February, Xie gave birth to her first child and applied for maternity benefits. But, during a routine document review, officials raised red flags upon discovering five maternity insurance claims filed by Xie within four years. The authorities reported the case to the police, leading Xie to surrender and return the entire amount of fraudulently obtained money.</p>

<p data-qa="Component-Component" datatype="p">She said, ''As an older pregnant woman with poor health, I worried about medical costs. In desperation, I impulsively faked miscarriages to get the insurance money. I have already resigned from my job and I deeply regret what I have done.''</p>

<p data-qa="Component-Component" datatype="p">Shanghai Prosecutor Gong Xiaoting said China's online insurance application system, designed for convenience, can be illegally exploited by criminals using photo-editing technology.</p>

<p data-qa="Component-Component" datatype="p">The court found Xie guilty of fraud and gave her a one -and-a-half-year suspended jail term on August 16.&nbsp;In his statement, Judge Wang Xinyuan said her actions not only violated her company's property rights but also posed a serious threat to the social insurance systems.&nbsp;</p>

<p data-qa="Component-Component" datatype="p">The insurance fraud sent shockwaves across mainland social media and sparked a heated debate about the need for strict measures to prevent similar cases in the future.&nbsp;</p>

<p data-qa="Component-Component" datatype="p">One user wrote, ''For about 60,000 yuan, she has ruined her life and her children's future,'' while another commented, ''Xie's monthly salary of 30,000 yuan is not low in China, yet she still resorted to fraud. It seems greed knows no bounds.''</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tens of thousands of people in Australia's southern island state of Tasmania were without power on Sunday after a cold front brought damaging winds and heavy rains, sparking flood warnings.</p>

<p>"Around 30,000 customers are without power across the state this morning," Tasnetworks, a state-owned power company, said on Facebook on Sunday.</p>

<p>The nation's weather forecaster said on its website that a cold front over Tasmania, population around 570,000 people, was moving away, "although bands of showers and thunderstorms continue to pose a risk of damaging wind gusts."</p>

<p>Properties, power lines and infrastructure had been damaged, Tasmania's emergency management minister Felix Ellis said in a televised media conference, adding that "the damage bill is likely to be significant".</p>

<p>Emergency authorities issued warnings for flooding, which they said could leave Tasmanians isolated for several days, as the state prepared for another cold front forecast to hit on Sunday night.</p>

<p>"There is potential for properties to be inundated, and roads may not be accessible," executive director of Tasmania State Emergency Service, Mick Lowe, said in a statement.</p>

<p>Authorities had received 330 requests for assistance in the last 24 hours, according to the agency.</p>

<p>Tasmania is a one-hour flight or 10-hour ferry crossing from the mainland city of Melbourne, 445 km (275 miles) away. About 40% of the island is wilderness or protected areas.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Judicial reforms championed by Mexico's outgoing president, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, and supported by his incoming successor have sparked diplomatic tensions with the United States and upset financial markets.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Judicial reforms championed by Mexico's outgoing president, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, and supported by his incoming successor have sparked diplomatic tensions with the United States and upset financial markets.</p>

<p>Here are the key points of the proposals, which will be debated in the ruling-party-dominated Congress, due to convene on Sunday:</p>

<h3><strong>What's the plan?&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Lopez Obrador wants the Supreme Court and other judges and magistrates to be elected by popular vote, arguing that the judiciary now serves the interests of the political and economic elite.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Candidates would be proposed by the executive, legislative and judicial branches of government.</p>

<p>At present, Supreme Court justices are nominated by the president and ratified by the Senate.</p>

<p>Judges and magistrates are appointed by the Federal Judicial Council, an administrative body.</p>

<p>The proposals, which are supported by president-elect Claudia Sheinbaum, who will take office on October 1, would reduce the number of Supreme Court judges from 11 to nine.</p>

<p>Their terms of office would be shortened from 15 years to 12.</p>

<p>A new body would be formed to supervise judges, in a country where the rate of impunity -- of being able to avoid accountability for crimes -- stands at 99 per cent, according to the non-governmental organization Impunidad Cero.</p>

<p>The system would have similarities to that of Bolivia, where members of the high courts are elected by popular vote.</p>

<p>Some states in the United States use elections to select judges. In Switzerland, judges are chosen by voters at the local level.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Why the controversy?</strong></h3>

<p>Opposition politicians, judges and judicial employees say that the reforms would politicize the justice system and compromise the separation of powers between the branches of government.</p>

<p>Margaret Satterthwaite, United Nations special rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, has also voiced "deep concerns" about the plan's "broad implications for judicial independence across Mexico."</p>

<p>"I urge the authorities to carefully reconsider the proposal, giving appropriate weight to the human rights guarantee of judicial independence," she wrote on social media platform X.</p>

<p>Human Rights Watch urged lawmakers to reject what it called the "dangerous proposals," saying they would "seriously undermine judicial independence and contravene international human rights standards."</p>

<p>The New York-based rights group expressed concern that the reforms would also eliminate restrictions on the military carrying out civilian law enforcement.</p>

<p>"Given Mexico's long history of serious human rights violations and official cover-ups, legislators should be taking steps to strengthen human rights protections, not weaken them," it said.</p>

<h3><strong>What's the diplomatic fallout?&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>US Ambassador to Mexico Ken Salazar has warned that the changes would "threaten" a trade relationship between the neighbouring countries that "relies on investors' confidence in Mexico's legal framework."</p>

<p>The reforms could pose "a major risk to the functioning of Mexico's democracy," he told journalists.</p>

<p>In particular, they could "make it easier for cartels and other bad actors to take advantage of politically motivated and inexperienced judges," Salazar said.</p>

<p>Canada, also a member of the major free trade partnership with the United States and Mexico, has for its part said investors are worried.</p>

<p>"They want stability, they want a judicial system that works if there are problems," Canadian Ambassador Graeme Clark said.</p>

<p>In response, Lopez Obrador announced a "pause" in relations with the US and Canadian embassies, criticizing the ambassadors' statements as "interventionist."</p>

<h3><strong>Why are markets nervous?&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Several investment firms have warned that curbing the independence of the judiciary would affect the resolution of conflicts between the government and the private sector.</p>

<p>The changes would "lead to heightened uncertainty" about the legal operating environment, British consultancy firm Capital Economics wrote in a note to clients.</p>

<p>"The politicization of the justice system could raise concerns about whether disputes between businesses and the government would be resolved in an impartial manner," it said.</p>

<p>Since Sheinbaum, a close ally of Lopez Obrador, won a landslide election victory on June 2, the Mexican peso has fallen by around 16 per cent against the dollar.</p>

<p>The drop reflects "concerns about the country's economic stability... and also the perception of risk that foreign investors are beginning to attribute to Mexico," Ramse Gutierrez, co-director of investments at asset manager Franklin Templeton, told AFP.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Israeli military announced today that it had discovered the bodies of six hostages in an underground tunnel in the southern Gaza Strip. Among the dead were dual citizens, including a US-Israeli and a Russian-Israeli. The Israeli military claimed that the hostages were brutally murdered by Hamas shortly before security forces could reach them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The hostages, whose identities have been confirmed as Carmel Gat, Eden Yerushalmi, Hersh Goldberg-Polin, Alexander Lobanov, Almog Sarusi, and Ori Danino, were kidnapped by Hamas militants during their brutal attack on southern Israel on October 7. The attack not only triggered the ongoing war but also led to the kidnapping of 251 individuals, of whom 97 remain captive, including 33 who the Israeli army believes are dead.</p>

<p>"A few hours ago, we informed the families that the bodies of their loved ones had been located by IDF troops in an underground tunnel in Rafah. According to our initial assessment, they were brutally murdered by Hamas terrorists shortly before we reached them," Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">This is a very difficult morning here in Israel.<br />
<br />
Carmel, Ori, Eden, Almog, Alex, Hersh.<br />
<br />
Murdered in cold blood by Hamas while in captivity.<br />
<br />
May their memory be a blessing. <a href="https://t.co/OAdZg8ZxB2">pic.twitter.com/OAdZg8ZxB2</a></p>
— Israel ישראל (@Israel) <a href="https://twitter.com/Israel/status/1830114580992844271?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 1, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p>The hostages were reportedly taken alive on October 7, and their bodies were discovered during combat operations in Rafah, approximately one kilometre from a tunnel where another hostage, Farhan Alkadi, had been rescued just days earlier. Hagari claimed that the IDF had been operating under extreme caution, knowing that additional hostages might be held in the area. However, they lacked precise information on the hostages' exact location.</p>

<p>The discovery of the bodies came amidst ongoing combat in Rafah, where IDF troops continued to engage with Hamas fighters.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"This morning, our hearts are broken alongside the families of Ori Danino, Alex Lobanov, Almog Sarusi, Hersh Goldberg-Polin, Carmel Gat, and Eden Yerushalmi," Hagari said. "It is impossible to put into words what the hostages have endured in Hamas captivity since October 7th, now 331 days, and what their families have been going through. This morning, this news shakes us all."</p>

<p>Among the six victims, Gat was abducted from the southern Israeli kibbutz community of Beeri and the others, aged between 23 and 32, taken from a music festival near the Gaza border.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 59-year-old teacher at Forest Lake Elementary in Volusia County was arrested on Saturday for allegedly using her legs to put a 3-year-old student in a headlock during class.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Vilma Otero, who has 36 years of teaching experience, including working with special needs children, faces a felony charge of child abuse without great bodily harm, local media reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to an arrest affidavit, a paraeducator witnessed the incident and reported it to the Florida Department of Children and Families (DCF). The paraeducator said she saw Otero sitting in a chair with the toddler between her legs, with the boy's face turning red as he screamed and tried to free himself from the chokehold.</p>

<p>The child, who has autism, reportedly had difficulty communicating with deputies but was able to say, "She hurt me," and mentioned getting "in trouble at school."</p>

<p>Deputies found slight redness on the child's neck and observed physical marks consistent with the paraeducator's account. Otero denied restraining the child in the described manner, even after being shown photos of the incident.</p>

<p>She stated that she had over 36 years of experience, particularly with children who have special needs, and stated that her training involved moving children to a different room if they needed to calm down.</p>

<p>Given the physical evidence and the paraeducator's account, deputies arrested Otero on a felony charge of child abuse without great bodily harm. The Volusia County School District has placed Otero on administrative leave pending the outcome of a thorough investigation by its Professional Standards department.</p>

<p>The district has placed Otero on administrative leave and is conducting a thorough investigation. "Volusia County Schools (VCS) is aware of the recent arrest of a Forest Lake Elementary teacher. VCS is committed to the safety and well-being of all of our students and is taking this situation very seriously. As such, our Professional Standards department is currently conducting a thorough investigation to determine the appropriate next steps. The teacher is currently on administrative leave," the statement read.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden said he was "devastated and outraged" over the recovery of six bodies of hostages, including that of an Israeli-American from the Gaza Strip.</p>

<p>Terming the development as "tragic" and "reprehensible" Biden on August 31 unequivocally warned that "Hamas leaders will pay for these crimes" while vowing to keep working around the clock for a deal to secure the release of remaining hostages held by the Palestine group.</p>

<p>The US President said Israeli forces had on Saturday recovered six bodies of hostages held by Hamas in a tunnel under the city of Rafah.</p>

<p>"We have now confirmed that one of the hostages killed by these vicious Hamas terrorists was an American citizen, Hersh Goldberg-Polin, Biden said in a statement released by the White House.</p>

<p>The Israel Defence Force (IDF) Spokesman, Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, was cited by Times of Israel as saying that the six hostages recovered from southern Gaza's Rafah were "brutally murdered" by Hamas shortly before IDF troops arrived.</p>

<p>Talking to reporters after leaving a church in Delaware, Biden said, "It's time this war ended." "We should end this war."</p>

<p>Vice President Kamala Harris said in a statement that Hamas "must be eliminated" and cannot be allowed to control Gaza.</p>

<p>Harris extended her condolences to 23-year-old American citizen Goldberg-Polin's parents Jon and Rachel, and declared, "I have no higher priority than the safety of American citizens, wherever they are in the world. President Biden and I will never waver in our commitment to free the Americans and all those held hostage in Gaza."</p>

<p>"Hamas is an evil terrorist organisation. With these murders, Hamas has even more American blood on its hands. I strongly condemn Hamas' continued brutality, and so must the entire world. From its massacre of 1,200 people to sexual violence, taking of hostages, and these murders, Hamas' depravity is evident and horrifying," she said in a White House statement.</p>

<p>Goldberg Polin was held hostage while he was trying to escape terrorists who infiltrated the Nova music festival and lost his hand in a grenade blast in the October 7 attacks.</p>

<p>Israel President Isaac Herzog said in a statement that the "heart of an entire nation is crushed into pieces". He said the killing of the hostages "proves Hamas's readiness to carry out crimes against humanity." He added the country's "sacred goal" was to bring them home.</p>

<p>Following Hamas attacks on October 7, Israel launched a war against the Palestinian group, in which more than 1,200 Israelis were killed and 250 taken hostage, according to Israeli authorities as per reports.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Germans head to the polls in two eastern states on Sunday, with the far-right AfD on track to win a state election for the first time and Chancellor Olaf Scholz's coalition set to receive a drubbing just a year before federal elections.</p>

<p>The Alternative for Germany is polling first on 30% in Thuringia and neck-and-neck with the conservatives in Saxony on 30-32%. A win would mark the first time a far-right party has the most seats in a German state parliament since World War Two.</p>

<p>The 11-year-old party would be unlikely to be able to form a state government even if it does win, as it is polling short of a majority and other parties refuse to collaborate with it.</p>

<p>But a strong showing for the AfD and another populist party, the newly-created Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance (BSW), named after its founder, a former communist, would complicate coalition building.</p>

<p>Both parties are anti-migration, eurosceptic, and Russia-friendly and are particularly strong in the former Communist-run East, where concerns about a cost of living crisis, the Ukraine war and immigration run deep.</p>

<p>A deadly stabbing spree linked to Islamic State 10 days ago stoked concerns about immigration in particular and criticism of the government's handling of the issue.</p>

<p>"Our freedoms are being increasingly restricted because people are being allowed into the country who don't fit in," the AfD's leader in Thuringia, Bjoern Hoecke, said at a campaign event in Nordhausen on Thursday.</p>

<p>The former history teacher is a polarizing figure who has called Berlin's memorial to Nazi Germany's Holocaust of Europe's Jews a "monument of shame" and was convicted earlier this year for using a Nazi slogan at a party rally.</p>

<h3><strong>'POLITICAL EARTHQUAKE'</strong></h3>

<p>All three parties in Scholz's federal coalition are seen losing votes on Sunday, with the Greens and liberal Free Democrats likely to struggle to reach the 5% threshold to enter parliament.</p>

<p>Discontent with the federal government stems partly from the fact it is an ideologically heterogeneous coalition plagued by infighting. A rout in the East will only fuel tensions in Berlin, analysts say.</p>

<p>"The state elections ..have the potential to trigger an earthquake in Berlin," Wagenknecht told a campaign rally in Erfurt, the capital of Thuringia, on Thursday.</p>

<p>Political analysts say Scholz's coalition is unlikely to disband before the next federal election in September 2025 as none of the partners currently expect a good result.</p>

<p>The BSW, which defines itself as socially conservative and economically leftwing, has seen a stellar rise since its creation in January, posing a particular threat to Scholz's centre-left Social Democrats.</p>

<p>The party is expected to win up to 12-20% on Sunday which could put it in a kingmaker position in both states. Its foreign policy views would make it an unlikely partner for any of the mainstream parties at the national level but is winning its votes.</p>

<p>"I especially like her stance on the Ukraine war, we can't simply keep delivering weapons," said BSW supporter Carola Gustavus at the event in Erfurt. "One has to negotiate even with the worst opponent."</p>

<p>The AfD and BSW together are expected to take some 40-50% of the vote in the two states compared with 23-27.5% at a national level, laying bare the continuing divide between East and West more than 30 years after reunification.</p>

<p>Party allegiance is lower in the East while scepticism of Germany's democratic structures and affinity with Russia are greater.</p>

<p>Moreover, narrowing economic differences with the West and a recent string of high-profile multi-billion euro investments in sectors such as the chipmaking and electric car industries have failed to cheer locals.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>US President Joe Biden also confirmed that body of Hersh Goldberg-Polin was among those found in the Gaza tunnels.</p>

<p>"Earlier today, in a tunnel under the city of Rafah, Israeli forces recovered six bodies of hostages held by Hamas," Biden said in a statement.</p>

<p>"We have now confirmed that one of the hostages... was an American citizen, Hersh Goldberg-Polin," the president added.</p>

<p>The 23-year-old was among 251 hostages caught during the October 7 attack on southern Israel by Hamas terrorists. About 250 people were abducted on October 7 when Hamas stormed into Israel, killing 1,200 people. More than 100 hostages were freed during a cease-fire late last year.</p>

<p>The parents of Goldberg-Polin, who was abducted from the Supernova music festival, addressed delegates at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago last month.</p>

<p>On Thursday, the couple joined other relatives of hostages rallying near the Gaza border. "Hersh! It's Mom... I love you, stay strong, survive," Rachel Goldberg-Polin shouted into a microphone.</p>

<p>A Hamas video from the day showed him being loaded onto a pick-up truck with part of his left arm, which was blown off in the attack, missing.</p>

<p>He appeared in a proof-of-life video released by Hamas on April 24 in which he said the captives were living "in hell". His left arm had been amputated below the elbow.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Police used a tank-like vehicle to smash into the home of Michael Royce Sparks, 62, where they believed the bodies would be found.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A couple living in a Southern California nudist community, who were reported missing earlier this week, are now presumed dead, police said on Friday. Their next-door neighbour was arrested after cops found human remains under his home, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/30/missing-couple-california-nudist-dead-arrest">The Guardian</a> reported.</p>

<p>Police used a tank-like vehicle to smash into the home of Michael Royce Sparks, 62, where they believed the bodies of Stephanie Menard, 73, and her husband, Daniel Menard, 79, would be found.</p>

<p>Carl Baker, spokesperson for the Redlands Police Department, confirmed the couple's deaths were likely, though no motive has been released. "We are confident that they are deceased and that they are still here on the property," Mr Baker told Sky News.</p>

<p>Human remains were later discovered in bags in a concrete bunker underneath the home, but they were not immediately identified.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sparks was booked into jail on Thursday night on suspicion of homicide after being found hiding under the house at Olive Dell Ranch, a residential RV park and nudist resort located about 60 miles east of Los Angeles. He is currently being held without bail and is scheduled for a court appearance on Tuesday.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The investigation into the couple's disappearance began after a friend reported them missing on Sunday, noting that they were last seen at their home on Saturday morning. Their car was found unlocked nearby, and both their phones and Stephanie Menard's purse were still inside their residence. Their pet dog, a Shih Tzu named Cuddles, is also missing. The case took a disturbing turn when a cadaver dog detected the presence of human remains under Sparks' home.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The arrest and discovery followed rapid developments on Thursday when police received a tip-off that someone involved in the couple's disappearance was still on the property. After failed attempts to contact Sparks, the tactical vehicle was brought in, leading to his eventual surrender around 9:30 pm.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The couple was described as kind and involved in the community, leaving friends confused and shocked by the events. A friend of the Menards, Tammie Wilkerson, told local news outlet KABC-TV that they were "very sweet people" and didnt have a "mean bone in their body at all."&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Hamas's October 7 attack resulted in the deaths of 1,199 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory military campaign has killed at least 40,691 people in Gaza, according to the territory's health ministry.

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Shanghai Museum has pulled in crowds this summer for an exhibition of ancient Egyptian relics including cat statues and other feline imagery, which on Saturday nights allows up to 200 visitors to bring along their own four-legged friends.</p>

<p>Inspired by ancient Egyptians' worship of Bastet, the goddess of protection - often depicted as a cat - the museum has given cats the chance to interact with part of the exhibition called "The Secrets of Saqqara".</p>

<p>"Egyptian archaeological teams discovered a cat temple in Saqqara and unearthed many cat mummies and cat statues. So when we were planning the event, we had cats as a theme, and then came the idea for 'Meow Night'," said Shanghai Museum Deputy Director Li Feng.</p>

<p>The "Top of the Pyramids: Ancient Egyptian Civilization Exhibition" began on July 19 and runs until Aug. 17, 2025, with "Meow Night" planned for at least 10 Saturdays. It has held six so far with tickets, including 200 bring-a-cat tickets, selling out each time.</p>

<p>Visitors bring their cats in carriers or pet strollers and can take them out only at designated areas, such as for a photo opportunity next to a statue of Bastet.</p>

<p>The cats are checked on entry to ensure up-to-date vaccinations and for signs of illness or stress. There are veterinarians onsite and rest areas for cats in case the stimulation from their night at the museum gets a bit much.</p>

<p>"It's very special that you can bring a cat with you," said visitor Qiu Jiakai who was attending "Meow Night" with one-year-old puss An Mao.</p>

<p>"I listened to the narrator's introduction saying ... many of today's pet cats are related to the cats domesticated in ancient Egypt. So I thought I would have to bring my cat here to see its ancestors and the cat goddess," she said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Do not leave the building, or take a coffee break - these are among the new instructions an Australian mining boss plans to give all his employees. The billionaire said this was costing their company a fortune and hence they plan to "hold staff captive all day long".</p>

<p>Chris Ellison, the managing director of Mineral Resources, has announced that his company will install amenities at their head office in Perth which ensures that employees do not leave the building during their work hours.</p>

<p>During a financial results presentation, Ellison expressed his disapproval of staff leaving the building to buy coffee or work from home, stating that it's costing the company too much money.</p>

<p>"I want to hold them captive all day long. I don't want them leaving the building. I don't want them walking down the road for a cup of coffee. We kind of figured out a few years ago how much that costs."</p>

<p>He also criticised other companies that allow remote work, despite the trend towards more flexible work arrangements since the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>To keep employees in the office, Mineral Resources has invested in amenities such as a restaurant, gym, staff psychologists, and even a creche, which costs just 20 dollars a day. Ellison believes that these facilities will make the head office a desirable place to be, eliminating the need for staff to leave.</p>

<p>The company formally banned work-from-home arrangements last year, and Ellison is urging other businesses to follow suit. He also expressed concerns about the trend towards shorter working weeks, stating that the industry cannot afford to have employees working fewer days while receiving full pay.</p>

<p>"The industry cannot afford it. We can't have people working three days a week and picking up five days a week pay - or four days," he said.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Preliminary investigations suggest that asphyxiation due to oxygen deprivation was the probable cause of death.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thai authorities have confirmed the deaths of three foreign workers who were trapped in a collapsed train tunnel for over five days, despite extensive rescue efforts, <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn49gwexqy1o" rel="nofollow, noindex">BBC</a></em> reported. The victims, comprising two Chinese nationals and one Myanmar citizen, were initially believed to have survived until Thursday. However, on Friday, authorities announced all three had died.&nbsp;All three bodies were found about 25 metres from the point of the tunnel collapse, officials said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The victims have been identified as Chinese project supervisor Hu Siang Min, Chinese backhoe driver Dong Chinlin, and a truck driver from Myanmar whose identity was yet to be confirmed, <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.independent.co.uk/asia/southeast-asia/thailand-tunnel-collapse-dead-chinese-national-b2604301.html" rel="nofollow, noindex">Independent</a></em> reported. Preliminary investigations suggest that asphyxiation due to oxygen deprivation was the probable cause of death, as announced by officials on Friday.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The tunnel, which was still under construction as part of the Thailand-China high-speed railway project, collapsed around 23:40 local time (16:40 GMT) last Saturday due to a landslide.&nbsp;To save the trapped workers, a dedicated team of rescuers from the State Railway of Thailand (SRT) and a specialised Chinese disaster response team worked tirelessly around the clock for over a week.&nbsp;They tried to pump oxygen into the tunnel to keep the workers alive, but it is unclear whether the tubes they used reached the workers at all.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Advanced scanners and trained sniffer dogs had also detected faint vital signs, suggesting that the trapped workers might still be clinging to life. However, the rescue operation was slow due to the treacherous conditions caused by the ongoing landslide. Rescuers faced a constant battle as falling debris and dirt continually filled in the holes they painstakingly dug, blocking their path.&nbsp;The rescue teams also had to be extremely careful while digging&nbsp;so that it would not cause other parts of the tunnel to collapse.</p>

<p>Anutin Charnvirakul, Thailand's caretaker Interior Minister, noted that rescue efforts were limited by the challenging engineering conditions.</p>

<p>"Nobody wanted [this incident] to happen. "We did not only try to save the lives of the victims, but we also had to [ensure the safety] of the rescuers and workers," he said at a press conference on Friday.</p>

<p>The state railways company offered its condolences to the victims' families and said it was ''ready to assist the families of the deceased''.</p>

<p>Following the tragic incident, the Thai authorities have launched a comprehensive investigation into the tunnel collapse. In the meantime, all construction activities in the vicinity of the tunnel have been temporarily suspended.&nbsp;</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former US President Donald Trump's dance moves at a public event on Friday have taken social media by storm. The annual Moms for Liberty event, held in Washington DC, saw 78-year-old Tump shake a leg on stage with the group's co-founder.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Trump just ended his Moms For Liberty event with his impressive dance moves! Moms love Donald Trump! Kamala (Harris) definitely doesn't want you to share this!" posted a Trump supporter with the video.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The internet is divided over the dance video. While some cheered Trump for being able to dance at the age of 78, some termed the entire episode as "comical".&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Trump is the people's president!" wrote one user.</p>

<p>"He's the worst version of the creepy, unstable uncle in the family," wrote another.</p>

<p>Moms for Liberty, a national group that has made strides within conservative circles, has been at the forefront of efforts to influence school curricula across the United States. The organisation has led initiatives to remove references to LGBTQ+ identities and discussions of structural racism from classrooms.</p>

<p>The Republican presidential frontrunner discussed issues surrounding these topics and did not shy away from making pointed political comments, particularly aimed at US Vice President Kamala Harris. In his address, Trump described her as a "defective person." He also expressed surprise at her limited media appearances, suggesting that her lack of interviews was indicative of her shortcomings as a leader. "I was surprised she didn't do a lot of interviews, but she's not good at it, I guess," Trump said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The US Presidential elections are scheduled to be held in November this year and is largely seen as a direct battle between Trump and Harris.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>More than 700 people arrested during protests that erupted after Venezuela's disputed presidential election have been transferred to maximum security prisons, a human rights group said Saturday.</p>

<p>The detainees, who had been held at police stations around the country, were transferred over the past week to two notorious prisons that were previously controlled by gangs, the Venezuelan Prisons Observatory said.</p>

<p>In many cases the transfers were conducted under questionable circumstances, with detainees' relatives not informed of the moves to Tocuyito and Tocoron prisons, the group said.</p>

<p>"They were conducted with many irregularities," the NGO said in a press release.</p>

<p>More than 2,400 people were arrested after the protests that broke out after President Nicolas Maduro was declared winner of the disputed July 28 election.</p>

<p>The opposition claims it won by a landslide and has voting records to prove this.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The leftist Maduro government, brushing off accusations of authoritarianism, has resisted intense international pressure to release vote tally numbers to back up its claim of victory.</p>

<p>The United States, the European Union and several Latin American countries have refused to recognize Maduro as having won without seeing detailed voting results.</p>

<p>The violence that accompanied the protests left 27 people dead and 192 injured.</p>

<p>Venezuelan Prisons Observatory said none of the people transferred to maximum security facilities have been allowed to contact their families or attorneys.</p>

<p>Of the 2,400 detainees, 1,581 have been listed as political prisoners by another advocacy group, called Penal Forum.</p>

<p>It said 114 of the total are adolescents and 18 of them were released on bail Saturday. This raised to 34 the number of youths freed from detention.</p>

<p>Some of those arrested are as young as 13 and have been sent to prisons with older, common criminals, opposition leader Maria Corina Machado said this week.</p>

<p>"What they have done is brutal," she said of the Maduro government.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

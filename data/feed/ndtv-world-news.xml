       <description><![CDATA[The FBI identified 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks of Bethel Park, Pennsylvania as the suspect in Saturday's attempted assassination of former US President Donald Trump at a campaign rally.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The FBI identified 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks of Bethel Park, Pennsylvania as the suspect in Saturday's attempted assassination of former US President Donald Trump at a campaign rally. The suspect was shot and killed by the Secret Service seconds after he allegedly fired shots toward a stage where Trump and was speaking in Butler, Pennsylvania. The FBI said it was working to determine a motive for the attack, in which one rally attendee died and two other spectators were critically injured. Trump was shot in the ear.</p>

<p>State voter records show that Crooks was a registered Republican. The upcoming Nov. 5 election would have been the first time Crooks had been old enough to vote in a presidential race.</p>

<p>Crooks lived about an hour away from where the shooting took place in Butler. The Federal Aviation Administration said on Sunday that it closed the airspace over Bethel Park for "special security reasons."</p>

<p>When Crooks was 17 he made a $15 donation to ActBlue, a political action committee that raises money for left-leaning and Democratic politicians, according to a 2021 Federal Election Commission filing. The donation was earmarked for the Progressive Turnout Project, a national group that rallies Democrats to vote. The groups did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.</p>

<p>Crooks' father, Matthew Crooks, 53, told CNN that he was trying to figure out what happened and would wait until he spoke to law enforcement before speaking about his son.</p>

<p>Thomas Crooks graduated in 2022 from Bethel Park High School, according to the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review. He received a $500 "star award" from the National Math and Science Initiative, according to the newspaper.</p>

<p>A 2022 graduation ceremony video cited by the New York Times shows Crooks receiving his high school diploma to some applause. Video from that ceremony posted online shows Crooks with glasses in a black graduation gown and posing with a school official. Reuters could not immediately verify the authenticity of the video. Law enforcement officials said on Saturday that Crooks carried no identification to the site of the shooting and had to be identified using other methods.</p>

<p>"We're looking at photographs right now and we're trying to run his DNA and get biometric confirmation," Kevin Rojek, FBI special agent in charge, said during a press briefing.</p>

<p>USA Today reported that dozens of law enforcement vehicles were stationed outside a residence listed at the address on Crooks' voter registration record. Agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives were on the scene and a bomb squad was at the residence, USA Today reported. The perimeter of the residence of the suspect was guarded on Sunday by yellow police caution tape. An Alleghany County Police vehicle was parked outside.</p>

<p>"It's insanity that anyone would do this," Dan Maloney, a 30-year-old resident from the area was quoted as saying by USA Today.Reuters could not immediately identify social media accounts or other online postings by Crooks. Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, did not immediately respond to questions on whether the platforms had removed any accounts related to the suspect.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Indian-American entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy today condemned the attack on former US President <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/fbi-identifies-shooter-in-donald-trump-assassination-attempt-as-20-year-old-thomas-matthew-crooks-news-agency-reuters-6102245#pfrom=home-ndtv_topscroll" target="_blank">Donald Trump</a>, who got hit on his ear during an attempt on his life at an election rally in Butler, Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>"We believe the fact that Trump is safe right now is nothing short of an act of God," Ramaswamy, who challenged the 78-year-old politician for the Republican presidential nomination at the primaries, wrote in a long post on X.</p>

<p>"My heart tells me God intervened not just for Trump, but for our nation.</p>

<p>"Today, the future survival of the United States of America came down to less than a hair's width in the path of a bullet," Ramaswamy said.</p>

<p>He continued his praise for <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/bullet-pierced-upper-part-of-my-right-ear-donald-trump-on-shooting-at-rally-6101088#pfrom=home-ndtv_topscroll" target="_blank">Trump</a> and said Americans just had the chance to see "our next President's true character, unvarnished".&nbsp;</p>

<p>"He took the fire, he took the hit, he felt the blood, and then he stood right back up for the people he was put here to lead," Ramaswamy added.</p>

<p>He, however, attacked US President Joe Biden and said, "First they sued him. Then they prosecuted him. Then they tried to take him off the ballot. The only thing more tragic than what just happened is that, if we're being honest, it wasn't totally a shock.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Biden's inevitable ritual condemnation of political violence today (when it comes) will be insufficient and irrelevant. No amount of verbiage today changes the toxic national climate that led to this tragedy," he said.</p>

<p>Regardless of who you vote for, let's unite around the truth that what happened today is "unacceptable, now and forever", he said.</p>

<p>His long post drew a reaction from billionaire <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/donald-trump-rally-shooting-elon-musk-fully-endorses-donald-trump-after-rally-shooting-6101736" target="_blank">Elon Musk</a>, who earlier reacted to the shocking shooting by quickly endorsing Trump.</p>

<p>"You very much predicted this," Musk said. "I badly hoped I would be wrong," Ramaswamy responded.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two witnesses at Donald Trump's election rally in Pennsylvania, where he was attacked, claimed to have seen the shooter, with one recalling how the gunman moved from roof to roof, apparently scouting for a perfect perch to shoot at the former US president.</p>

<p>The FBI on Sunday identified the gunman as Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20, from Bethel Park, Pennsylvania. Crooks, armed with an AR-style rifle, was killed by Secret Service personnel. He fired multiple shots at the stage from an “elevated position outside of the rally venue,” the agency said.</p>

<p>The gunman was able to get close enough to shoot and injure Trump is seen as a huge failure of the security agencies tasked with providing cover for him ahead of the election.</p>

<p>The gunman was on a rooftop approximately "200 to 250 yards" from where the former US president was addressing his supporters, US media reported.</p>

<p>According to an attendee named Ben Macer, he was up along the fence line and "saw the guy move from roof to roof", CBS News reported.</p>

<p>Macer further said he told an officer that the shooter was on the roof, approximately "200 to 250 yards" away from where Trump was addressing his supporters.</p>

<p>"When I turned around to go back to where I was, it was when the gunshots started, and then it was just chaos, and we all came running away, and that was that," he said.</p>

<p>Butler resident Ryan Knight, another witness along the fence line, also said he saw the suspected shooter atop the American Glass Research building, the report said.</p>

<p>"I walked over about 20 minutes before the shooting happened to stand along the fence line where Trump was. As I was doing that, I was right beside the AGR building, which had the shooter on it," Knight said.</p>

<p>"When I was sitting there, a guy said, 'Oh God, he had a gun.' When I looked up, there was a guy on top of the building with an M16 with a blanket, pointing at the president. He starts shooting. Four to five shots rang out. I throw the guy I'm with to the ground. I jump to the ground, I look up, and I see his head get split up from the shot from the Secret Service," he said.</p>

<p>The Secret Service has confirmed that one attendee was killed and two others were critically injured in the shooting.</p>

<p>"All the cops started flying over, pushing us out, they took my name, witness report, [and] cell phone number to go over what happened because there [weren't many] eyewitnesses," Knight said.</p>

<p>"My main thought is why wasn't the Secret Service on top of AGR? That's a very big vantage point to shoot at the president. How did that get missed?" Knight asked.</p>

<p>Macer said he did not get a clear look at the alleged shooter, but reiterated that he saw him move from building to building.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Moscow called on the United States Sunday to "take stock" of its "policies of incitement to hatred", while using the assassination attempt on former president Donald Trump to denounce support for Ukraine.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Addressing "those who vote in the United States to supply arms" to Kyiv, the Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova denounced support for Kyiv, which she said stoked "attacks against the Russian president".&nbsp;</p>

<p>She added that "perhaps it would be better to use this money to fund the American police and other services that are supposed to ensure law and order in the United States?"&nbsp;</p>

<p>A Trump victory in the November elections would put into question continued US support for Ukraine as it resists the Russian offensives launched in 2022.</p>

<p>The Republican Party candidate has suggested that he would end the conflict very quickly if he won back the presidency, which Kyiv fears would mean it would be forced to negotiate with Moscow from a weakened position.</p>

<p>Vladimir Putin has said he takes Trump's comments about ending the war "very seriously".</p>

<p>Zakharova added that "when other means of getting rid of troublesome president are exhausted, good old Lee Harvey Oswald comes into play", referring to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in 1963, a source of numerous conspiracy theories including that his death was ordered from within the US state apparatus.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The JFK assassination commission concluded in 1964 that Lee Harvey Oswald, a former Marine who had lived in the Soviet Union, had acted alone.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Climate related stressors like heat, wildfires, floods, droughts, diseases and rising sea levels affect education outcomes and threaten to undo educational gains of recent decade, according to the Global Education Monitoring Report (GEM).]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Climate related stressors like heat, wildfires, floods, droughts, diseases and rising sea levels affect education outcomes and threaten to undo educational gains of recent decade, according to the Global Education Monitoring Report (GEM).</p>

<p>The global report compiled by UNESCO, Monitoring and Evaluating Climate Communication and Education (MECCE) project and University of Saskatchewan in Canada has pointed out that most low and middle-income countries are experiencing climate-related school closures every year, increasing chances of learning loss and dropout.</p>

<p>"Climate change related impacts are already disrupting education systems and outcomes. Direct effects include the destruction of education infrastructure as well as injuries and loss of life among students, parents and school staff. Climate change has a negative impact on education indirectly through its displacement of people and the effects on people's livelihoods and health," the report said.</p>

<p>"Over the past 20 years, schools were closed in at least 75 per cent of the extreme weather events, impacting five million people or more. Increasingly frequent natural disasters, including floods and cyclones, have led to the deaths of students and teachers and have damaged and destroyed schools.</p>

<p>"Exposure to heat has significant detrimental effects on children's educational outcomes. An analysis linking census and climate data in 29 countries between 1969 and 2012 showed that exposure to higher than average temperatures during the prenatal and early life period is associated with fewer years of schooling, especially in Southeast Asia," it added.</p>

<p>The GEM report noted that a child experiencing temperatures that are two standard deviations above average is predicted to attain 1.5 fewer years of schooling than children experiencing average temperatures.</p>

<p>"High temperatures reduced high-stakes test performance in China and led to reductions in both high school graduation and college entrance rates. In the United States, without air conditioning, a school year hotter by 1 degree Celsius, reduced test scores by 1 per cent.</p>

<p>"Very hot school days disproportionately impacted African American and Hispanic students, due to poor infrastructure conditions, accounting for roughly five per cent of the racial achievement gap. In the most disadvantaged municipalities in Brazil, which were also amongst those most exposed to heat risk, students lost about one per cent of learning per year due to rising temperatures," it said.</p>

<p>Elaborating about impact of climate change on education in India, the crucial report pointed out that a study of rainfall shocks over the first 15 years of life in India found that they negatively affected vocabulary at age five and mathematics and non-cognitive skills at age 15.</p>

<p>"The effects were more severe for boys and children of parents with a lower educational attainment. An analysis of disasters experienced early in life by over 140,000 children in seven Asian countries found a negative association with school enrolment, especially for boys, and with mathematics performance, especially for girls, by the time they reach 13 to 14 years," it said.</p>

<p>Climate-induced education vulnerability is found to be worse for marginalized populations. Of the 10 countries most affected by extreme weather events in 2019, eight were low or lower-middle-income countries. Of the 33 countries identified as bearing extremely high climate risks for children, where nearly one billion people live, 29 are also considered to be fragile states. "Climate change increases the likelihood of displacement and is one of the reasons why internal displacement has reached the highest levels on record. During 2022, 32.6 million were internally displaced due to disasters. Analysis of five countries – Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Tuvalu and Vietnam – finds five displacement patterns: temporary displacement, permanent migration to urban settlements, government-planned relocation, cross-border migration and trapped populations.</p>

<p>"These displacement scenarios lead to different barriers to education, related to a lack of financial resources, documentation or residency requirements," it said.</p>

<p>The report noted that dealing with direct and indirect effects of climate change-induced disruptions requires a comprehensive focus on climate adaptation, including multi-sectoral planning, curriculum reform, teacher training and community awareness and engagement.</p>

<p>Noting that there are increasing calls to improve the ability of school infrastructure to absorb shocks and adapt to stresses and changes brought about by climate change impacts, the crucial report claimed that the efforts remain insufficient.</p>

<p>"Planning and funding for climate impact risks and adaptation remain inadequate Analysis of country submissions for the mid-term review of the Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction found risk levels are rising much faster than the resilience of the education sector in most countries, despite recognition that disaster risk resilience is key for preventing hazards from becoming disasters "Yet awareness is low. In a recent survey of 94 education policy makers in 28 low- and middle-income countries, only about half believed that hotter temperatures inhibited learning. About 61 per cent viewed climate change among the bottom three out of 10 priorities in education," it said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump's campaign team has announced plans to bolster security protocols to ensure his safety after the former US president was injured in a shooting incident at an election rally in Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>Trump, 78, was injured on Saturday after being shot in the ear during an apparent assassination attempt during a Republican Party campaign event in Butler, Pennsylvania. The 20-year-old male attacker was shot and killed by a member of the Secret Service.</p>

<p>Following the incident, Trump's campaign managers Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita said the campaign would be employing additional security measures, CNN reported.</p>

<p>Wiles and LaCivita told staffers in a new memo that they "remain horrified" at the attack. They added that they "hope that this horrendous act will bring our team, and indeed the nation, together in unity and we must renew our commitment to safety and peace for our country".</p>

<p>"We condemn all forms of violence, and will not tolerate dangerous rhetoric on social media," the memo said.</p>

<p>The campaign managers said the Republican National Convention will continue as planned in Milwaukee, "where we will nominate our President to be the brave and fearless nominee of our Party".</p>

<p>Republican delegates will nominate Trump as the party's candidate in the November 5 presidential election against the nominee of the Democratic Party, which till late last month was thought to be incumbent US President Joe Biden.</p>

<p>However, after his disastrous performance against Trump at the first presidential debate, pressure has mounted on 81-year-old Biden to quit the race and allow someone else from the party to contest against the former president.</p>

<p>"In moments of tragedy and horror, we must be resolute in our mission to reelect President Trump," the memo reads.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The assassination attempt on former president Donald Trump is a "horrific moment" for America and a "sobering reminder" of the threat that political violence poses to democracy in the country ahead of the high-stakes presidential election, the US media commented on Sunday.</p>

<p>Trump, 78, survived an attempt on his life on Saturday when a young shooter fired multiple shots at him at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania, injuring his right ear.</p>

<p>Americans received a sobering reminder on Saturday of the threat that political violence poses to our democracy, The New York Times said.</p>

<p>"It is now incumbent on political leaders of both parties and on Americans individually and collectively, to resist a slide into further violence and the type of extremist language that fuels it. Saturday's attack should not be taken as a provocation or a justification," it said.</p>

<p>"Americans also must be clear-eyed about the challenge that is confronting this nation. Saturday's events cannot be written off as an aberration. Violence is infecting and inflecting American political life," the newspaper said.</p>

<p>"Acts of violence have long shadowed American democracy, but they have loomed larger and darker of late. Cultural and political polarisation, the ubiquity of guns and the radicalising power of the internet have all been contributing factors, as this board laid out in its editorial series The Danger Within in 2022. This high-stakes presidential election is further straining the nation's commitment to the peaceful resolution of political differences," it said.</p>

<p>Democracy requires partisans to accept that the process is more important than the results. Even before Saturday's events, there were worrying signs that many Americans were failing that essential test, it added.</p>

<p>The assassination attempt is a horrific moment for America that could have been much worse. But we can't say it comes as a complete surprise. Political hostility and hateful rhetoric have been rising to a decibel level that far too often in the American past has led to violence and attempted murder. Some of us still remember 1968 all too well, The Wall Street Journal said.</p>

<p>The shooter alone is responsible for his actions. But leaders on both sides need to stop describing the stakes of the election in apocalyptic terms. Democracy won't end if one or the other candidate is elected, it added.</p>

<p>"Fascism is not aborning if Mr. Trump wins, unless you have little faith in American institutions," the paper said.</p>

<p>The targeting of a former president, also the Republican presidential candidate for the November election, at a campaign rally just days before he accepted the Republican nomination is, by definition, an attack on democracy and the right of each American to choose their leaders, CNN said in an opinion piece.</p>

<p>The attempted assassination, which opens a dark new chapter in America's cursed story of political violence, shook a nation already deeply estranged during one of the most tense periods of its modern history, it said.</p>

<p>While Trump is not currently serving as president, his wounding underscores the ever-present threat that always hangs over the office and those who run for it – and especially for those who claim it, it said.</p>

<p>Trump is likely to face President Joe Biden, a Democrat, in the November election. However, Biden, 81, is under pressure to quit the race following his disastrous debate performance against Trump last month.</p>

<p>Four American presidents have been killed while in office, most recently John F. Kennedy in 1963.</p>

<p>The fact that Trump was attacked ends a 40-year period in which many have assumed that the Secret Service's expertise had greatly reduced the potential for such outrages – and will cast a pall that will last for years, the news network said.</p>

<p>Trump's targeting during a presidential campaign drew comparisons to the assassination of Democratic candidate Robert F Kennedy in 1968, a blood-soaked year that also saw the killing of civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr and violence at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, which will host the same event this year, it said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">FBI has identified the person who shots fire at former US President Donald Trump during his rally in Pennsylvania on Saturday. The suspect has been identified as Thomas Matthew Crooks.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The US Secret Service is investigating how a person with an AR-15 rifle entered the scene and was able to fire multiple shots.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Now, let us understand&nbsp; what is AR-15 rifle&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">– AR-15 rifle falls under the category of “modern sporting rifle” aka MSR. Such rifles are mostly used in competitions and hunting purposes.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">– As per the <a href="https://www.nssf.org/msr/">Firearm Industry Trade Association</a>,&nbsp;the initials AR stands for ArmaLite, the company that made it in the 1950s.</p>

<p dir="ltr">- The&nbsp;Association added people often mistake AR-15 rifles for&nbsp;“assault weapons” or “assault rifles.”&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">– “These rifles' accuracy, reliability, ruggedness and versatility serve target shooters and hunters well. They are true all-weather firearms,” the association added.</p>

<p dir="ltr">– The semi-automatic version of this rifle was created for the military. Now, the AR-15 models are modular and owners are able to customise them as per their requirements, keeping the legal criteria in check.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Why is it dangerous?</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">— The speed of the bullet is deadly. As per <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/interactive/2023/ar-15-damage-to-human-body/">The Washington Post</a>, the quantity of propellant in the cartridge has the power to send the bullet at a “speed that would cross six football fields in a second.”</p>

<p dir="ltr">– The bullet can kill a person instantly after it hits a vital organ. “As that bullet slows down…that energy is so massive it has to go someplace, and your body will literally tear apart,” a trauma surgeon was quoted as saying.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The shooting at an election rally in Pennsylvania's Butler last evening has left former US President Donald Trump injured and the Joe Biden administration red-faced. While several prominent voices from the US have questioned the security preparations at the rally venue, some Republican leaders have gone a step ahead and targeted Biden.</p>

<p>In his first response after the assassination attempt, Trump thanked the Secret Service and law enforcement authorities for their swift response, but added, "It is incredible that such an act can take place in our country." Trump has said a bullet pierced his right ear. One person in the audience was killed and two others critically injured in the shooting. The gunman, 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks, was gunned down.&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

The central premise of the Biden campaign is that President Donald Trump is an authoritarian fascist who must be stopped at all costs.<br />

<p>Republican senator JD Vance, who could be Trump's running mate in the US election due later this year, said the shooting is "not just some isolated incident". "The central premise of the Biden campaign is that President Donald Trump is an authoritarian fascist who must be stopped at all costs. That rhetoric led directly to President Trump's attempted assassination," he said in a post on X.</p>

<p>Republican leader and Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene alleged that the Democrats want Trump and his supporters dead.</p>

<p>"Joe Biden told donors it's 'time to put Trump in a bull's eye,' and that is EXACTLY what happened. House Democrats, led by Bennie Thompson, introduced a bill to strip USSS protection from President Trump.</p>

<p>"The weaponized DOJ has done everything they can to make sure President Trump spends the rest of his life in PRISON, while sending non-violent J6ers (those involved in the Capitol attack on January 6,2021) to jail for years. They want President Trump and his supporters dead. We won't forget," she told a TV channel. In a separate post on X, she said, "The Democrats and the media are to blame for every drop of blood spilled today. For years and years, they've demonized him and his supporters."</p>

<p>US President Joe Biden has strongly condemned the incident. White House officials said he has also spoken to the Republican leader, his arch-rival in this election, after the shooting.</p>

<p>"There's no place in America for this kind of violence. It's sick. It's sick. It's one of the reasons why we have to unite this country... We cannot be like this, we cannot condone this," Biden told reporters in an emergency briefing after the attack on Trump.</p>

<p>"The idea that there's political violence, or violence in America like this, is just unheard of. It's just not appropriate. Everybody, everybody must condemn it. Everybody," Biden said.</p>

<p>Vice-President Kamala Harris too has slammed the shooting. "I have been briefed on the shooting at former President Trump's event in Pennsylvania. Doug and I are relieved that he is not seriously injured. We are praying for him, his family, and all those who have been injured and impacted by this senseless shooting."</p>

<p>We are grateful to the United States Secret Service, first responders, and local authorities for their immediate action. Violence such as this has no place in our nation. We must all condemn this abhorrent act and do our part to ensure that it does not lead to more violence," she said in a post on X.</p>

<p>Michael Whatley, chairman of the Republican National Committee, has said in a statement that the former President is doing well and is grateful to law enforcement and first responders.</p>

<p>"President Trump looks forward to joining you all in Milwaukee as we proceed with our convention to nominate him to serve as the 47th President of the United States. As our party's nominee, President Trump will continue to share his vision to Make America Great Again," he said in a statement.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The shooter who attempted to assassinate former US President Donald Trump has been identified as 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Cooks.</p>

<p>Crooks of Bethel Park, Pennsylvania, fired shots, one of which grazed Trump in the ear at an outdoor rally in Butler. Thomas Matthew Cooks was planted on the roof of a manufacturing plant located over 300 feet away from the stage at Butler Farm Show grounds, the New York Post reported, citing sources.</p>

<p>The US Secret Service snipers shot him, and an AR-style rifle was later recovered. Bethel Park is a village 40 miles south of where Trump's rally was held in Butler. Crooks' motive behind firing on the presumptive Republican presidential nominee is unclear.</p>

<p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is leading the investigation into the shooting incident at former US President Donald Trump's rally.</p>

<p>"Special agents of the FBI Pittsburgh Field Office responded immediately, to include crisis response team members and evidence response technicians. We will continue to support this investigation with the full resources of the FBI, alongside our partners at the US Secret Service and state and local law enforcement. Anyone with information that may assist with the investigation is asked to call our tip line at 1-800-CALL-FBI," it added.</p>

<p>Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro said former President Donald Trump has left the Butler area following the shooting at a rally on Saturday (local time).</p>

<p>In a statement posted on X, Shapiro stated, "Under the protection of US Secret Service and with the assistance of the Pennsylvania State Police, former President Trump has now left the Butler area. Lori and I are thankful that his team reports that he is fine and we continue to wish him a full and speedy recovery. We mourn the loss of life and pray for the two victims who are being treated at this time."</p>

<p>In the post on X, he further said, "I am grateful for all law enforcement who responded, protected the former president, and worked to bring the situation under control. Federal law enforcement officials will continue to lead on the investigation into the shooting of former President Trump. Pennsylvania State Police will lead the investigation into the shooting of the other victims."</p>

<p>"I have been in regular communication with law enforcement on the ground in Pennsylvania and have spoken with President Biden who offered his full support. As we wait to learn more from the investigations, I am mindful of just how painful and shocking this event is to so many of our fellow Pennsylvanians. I respectfully ask that we treat our fellow Americans with respect and join together to universally condemn the unacceptable violence we witnessed earlier today in Butler," he added.</p>

<p>A shooting at a Pennsylvania rally on Saturday (local time) that injured Trump has heightened concerns about political violence and increased awareness regarding past attacks and assassination attempts against presidents and candidates, CBS News reported.</p>

<p>According to a 2008 report compiled by the Congressional Research Service, direct assaults against presidents, presidents-elect, and candidates have occurred on 15 separate occasions, with five resulting in death, according to CBS News. Of the 45 individuals serving as president, 13 have been subject to actual or attempted assassinations. The number does not include the shooting incident that involves Trump.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">SpaceX has confirmed that 20 satellites – blasted off the Flacon 9 rocket from California, US on Thursday — will crash back to Earth. The company said that there had been a liquid oxygen leak developed in the second stage.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">In a statement released on its <a href="https://www.spacex.com/launches/mission/?missionId=sl-9-3">official website</a>, the company said, “Falcon 9's second stage performed its first burn nominally, however a liquid oxygen leak developed on the second stage. After a planned relight of the upper stage engine to raise perigee – or the lowest point of orbit – the Merlin Vacuum engine experienced an anomaly and was unable to complete its second burn.”</p>

<p>SpaceX, in a series of posts on X (formerly Twitter), shared details about its team's effort to contact the&nbsp;satellites. It said, “SpaceX has made contact with 5 of the satellites so far and is attempting to have them raise orbit using their ion thrusters.”</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">During tonight's Falcon 9 launch of Starlink, the second stage engine did not complete its second burn. As a result, the Starlink satellites were deployed into a lower than intended orbit.<br />
<br />
SpaceX has made contact with 5 of the satellites so far and is attempting to have them…</p>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>In a follow-up post, SpaceX said that the team was able to get in touch with 10 of the satellites. “The team made contact with 10 of the satellites and attempted to have them raise orbit using their ion thrusters, but they are in an enormously high-drag environment with their perigee, or lowest point of their elliptical orbit, only 135 km above the Earth.”</p>

<p>Explaining the possible reasons behind the satellite failure, the company said, “Each pass through perigee removes 5+ km of altitude from the highest point in the satellite orbit. At this level of drag, our maximum available thrust is unlikely to be enough to successfully raise the satellites.”</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An "aggressive" United Airlines passenger was caught on camera biting a flight attendant after a plane departed from Miami this week.</p>

<p>United Flight 762 left Miami International Airport in Florida on Tuesday evening, bound for Newark, New Jersey, but had to make an unexpected diversion to Orlando after the unnamed female passenger started causing chaos on board.</p>

<p>United Airlines told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/united-airlines-passenger-bite-miami-plane-b2577946.html"><em>The Independent </em></a>in a statement that the passenger became "aggressive and disruptive," prompting the flight attendants to "work to de-escalate the situation and protect other customers."</p>

<p>Cellphone footage of the incident, obtained by <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.tmz.com/2024/07/10/woman-bites-flight-attendant-rips-vest-meltdown-united-flight-orlando/"><em>TMZ</em></a>, depicts a woman screaming and using profanity towards other passengers while flight crew members attempt to restrain her in the aisle.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Flight attendants are shown attempting to calm the situation by securing zip-ties around her wrists, but the footage also captures the woman attempting to bite the shirt of one of the crew members.</p>

<p>"Let go of me; I'm a f****** girl. What are you gonna do, kill me?" the woman appears to say in the footage.</p>

<p>"These people have an attitude problem, and they don't f****** do their jobs. They're handcuffing me. Why are you handcuffing me?' she yells.</p>

<p>In addition, the woman is heard shouting profanities and making threats toward someone off-camera in the video.</p>

<p>Later in the footage, police officers are seen boarding the plane and escorting the woman off, prompting applause from fellow passengers.</p>

<p>United Airlines told The Independent that the flight crew opted to divert to Orlando, where law enforcement awaited to remove the woman from the aircraft.</p>

<p>A spokesperson from the Orlando Police Department informed FOX 35 that the passenger was taken to a local hospital for a medical assessment, noting that no arrest had been made as of Wednesday.</p>

<p>The Independent has reached out to the Orlando Police Department for additional details.</p>

<p>The disruptive incident resulted in a three and a half hour delay for the flight, as a new crew had to be assembled in Orlando, according to WSVN.</p>

<p>The reason behind the woman's sudden onset of "aggressive" behavior during the flight remains unclear.</p>

<p>As of 2024, the Federal Aviation Administration has received 893 reports of unruly passengers.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Those who attended Donald Trump's rally in Pennsylvania last night -- and were witnesses to a shocking assassination attempt -- were not allowed to carry purses and security checks took nearly two hours, a woman who was at the gathering has told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/13/2024-election-campaign-updates-biden-trump-rally/#author-box">The Washington Post</a>.</p>

<p>Fifty-one-year-old Melissa Shaffert is an English teacher and went to the rally at Butler with her boyfriend. She usually carried a concealed firearm and knife, but left them at home yesterday because she knew they wouldn't be allowed. Purses were not allowed and it took them 1-2 hours to get through the scanners, she has told the Post. "They took everything out and they took their time," she said.</p>

<p>About 50 feet from the stage, she said, were two tractors and giant combines. "I thought: 'I'm sure glad no one can get a weapon in here because someone could stand on the [equipment] and we'd be sitting ducks,'" she said hours after the former President was shot at. While Trump suffered a bullet injury in his right ear, one of those attending the rally died and two others were critically injured in the shooting.</p>

<p>Shaffert recounted that the Republican leader had started talking about illegal immigration when she heard loud, abrupt sounds and thought they were fireworks. She then heard "whistles" and "whizzes."</p>

<p>"I thought: That's bullets. I said: 'Get your head down!'"</p>

<p>She said that chaos broke out as the crowd realised that they were caught in a shooting and that she did not immediately realise that Trump was injured. "People were laying on the ground Then everyone was staying calm and helping each other get up. People were like: 'Are you OK? Are you OK?'" Shaffert said.</p>

<p>Shaffert and her boyfriend somehow managed to make their way to the car and left the spot. It's only when they reached home that they realised the extent of what had happened.</p>

<p>"It's devastating. That a presidential nominee has been shot is unbelievable," she told the Post. "It's very scary. I don't feel like proper precautions are being taken," she added.</p>

<p>The FBI, which is investigating the assassination attempt, has identified 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks as the shooter. He was gunned down soon after the shooting.</p>

<p>Asked how the gunman was able to fire several shots before he was neutralised, FBI Special Agent in Charge Kevin Rojek said it was "surprising". Asked about security, he said Secret Service "needs to answer that question."</p>

<p>"They do the initial security assessments and determine where the different security locations should be. And they're the ones who are in charge of securing the scene," he said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has identified <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/donald-trump-rally-shooting-who-was-thomas-matthew-crooks-man-who-tried-to-assassinate-donald-trump-6102487" target="_blank">Thomas Matthew Crooks</a> as the suspected shooter behind the attempted assassination of former US President <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/bullet-pierced-upper-part-of-my-right-ear-donald-trump-on-shooting-at-rally-6101088" target="_blank">Donald Trump</a>, it said in a statement today.</p>

<p>Crooks, 20, was killed by security officials when he allegedly opened fire at the 78-year-old Republican presidential candidate, injuring his ear, during a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He was registered as a Republican, according to the state's voter records.</p>

<p>"The FBI has identified Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20, of Bethel Park, Pennsylvania, as the subject involved in the assassination attempt of former President Donald Trump on July 13, in Butler, Pennsylvania," the FBI said in a statement quoted by NBC and CBS.</p>

<p>Law enforcement officials earlier told reporters they had tentatively identified the suspected shooter but were not ready to do so publicly. They also said they had not yet identified the motive. The FBI,&nbsp;which is the lead federal law enforcement agency in the investigation,&nbsp;had said the shooting was being treated as "an assassination attempt" against the former president.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/donald-trump-assassination-attempt-donald-trump-shooting-on-identity-and-motive-of-donald-trump-rally-shooter-fbi-gives-an-update-6101826" target="_blank">Trump</a> was hit in the ear in the shocking shooting,&nbsp;which left a bystander dead and two others critically injured. He was quickly rushed off stage by the US Secret Service agents, with blood seen on his face.</p>

<p>The gunshots were heard when Trump had just started speaking at his final rally before the Republican National Convention.</p>

<p>Thousands of his supporters were in attendance when the shooting, which was captured live on news channels, happened.</p>

<h3><strong>Donald Trump Says Bullet Pierced Part Of Right Ear</strong></h3>

<p>Donald Trump, in his first account of being attacked during a rally, said, "I was shot with a bullet that pierced the upper part of my right ear."</p>

<p>"I knew immediately that something was wrong in that I heard a whizzing sound, shots, and immediately felt the bullet ripping through the skin," Trump said on his Truth Social site.</p>

<p>"Much bleeding took place, so I realized then what was happening," he added.</p>

<p>He also thanked the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/video-secret-service-snipers-in-action-after-shots-fired-at-donald-trump-6101405" target="_blank">Secret Service</a> and law enforcement for their "rapid response".</p>

<p>"It is incredible that such an act can take place in our country," he said.</p>

<p>The shocking incident occurred less than four months before the November 5 US presidential election, when Trump is set to face an election rematch with Democratic President Joe Biden.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">The world woke up to a shooting incident that took place during former US President Donald Trump's rally in Pennsylvania on Saturday. As per the 78-year-old's communications director Steven Cheung, he is "fine and is being checked out at a local medical facility.”</p>

<p>While world leaders have expressed their shock and condemned such an act of violence, a section of people on X (formerly Twitter) has tried to lighten the mood by referring the incident to the all-time hit show&nbsp;The Simpsons.&nbsp;For context,&nbsp;The Simpsons&nbsp;is known for its bizarre predictions.</p>

<p>It all started after a user claimed that Donald Trump's shooting incident was predicted by&nbsp;The Simpsons.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sharing a set of screenshots from the episode, the user said, “Simpsons got some explaining to do.”</p>

<p>He added, “It is incredible that such an act can take place in our Country. Nothing is known at this time about the shooter, who is now dead.

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Security agencies in the US have identified the shooter behind the assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump as 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks, but are yet to share details on the motive behind the crime.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The FBI has identified 20-year-old&nbsp;Thomas&nbsp;Matthew&nbsp;Crooks as the "subject involved" in the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump, the agency said in a statement.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Earlier, at a press briefing, FBI Special Agent Kevin Rojek said, "At this time, we are not prepared to identify who the shooter is. We are close to that identification. As soon as we are 100 per cent confident who that individual is, we will share it with the press."</p>

<p>The FBI official also said they are not yet sure of the motive behind the assassination attempt, that has also left one person dead and two others critically injured.</p>

<p>"We do not currently have an identified motive, although our investigators are working tirelessly to attempt to identify what that motive was," he said.</p>

<p>The FBI is the lead federal law enforcement agency in the investigation into the assassination attempt.</p>

<p>The agency has said the campaign venue at Butler continues to be an "active crime scene". "We are working closely with other federal agencies, our state partners and our local police partners as well."</p>

<p>Colonel Chris Paris, commissioner of Pennsylvania state police, told the media that they are working closely with the FBI in this investigation. "We are prepared to support this investigation in any way, shape or form. And we stand ready to participate in a full, fair, competent and thorough investigation," he said.</p>

<p>The FBI has also called upon the public for any information on the shooting. "We need the public's help, anyone who was on scene, who saw anything... please report that to the FBI," Special Agent Rojek said.</p>

<p>The assassination attempt on Trump, US President Joe Biden's biggest opponent in the US election later this year, has set alarm bells ringing through the country's security establishment.</p>

<p>Multiple rounds targeting the former President were fired at the Butler rally yesterday. Trump said one of the bullets pierced the upper part of his right ear. One person was killed and two others critically injured in the shooting. Visuals showed Secret Service operatives escorting the former President to safety after the shooting, bloodstains on his face.</p>

<p>US President Joe Biden has strongly condemned the incident and also spoken to his arch rival after the shooting.</p>

<p>"There's no place in America for this kind of violence. It's sick. It's sick. It's one of the reasons why we have to unite this country... We cannot be like this, we cannot condone this," Biden told reporters in an emergency briefing after the attack on Trump.</p>

<p>"The idea that there's political violence, or violence in America like this, is just unheard of. It's just not appropriate. Everybody, everybody must condemn it. Everybody," Biden said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

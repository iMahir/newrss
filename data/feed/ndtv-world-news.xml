<p>Apple chief Tim Cook is visiting China. This is the second time that Cook has visited the Asian giant this year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Apple operates at the frontiers of technology to create electronic products that are so well-crafted and aspirational that die-hard fans turn sidewalks near Apple stores into campsites ahead of new product arrivals. They have catapulted it to become the world's most valuable company with a market capitalisation of $3.5 trillion, the same as India's GDP in 2023.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cook's visit is intriguing and important because Apple is an American native. And the US-China rivalry, especially in cutting-edge science and technology, is irrevocably shaping the 21st century. <em>Bloomberg </em>reported China's Minister of Industry and Information Technology Jin Zhuanglong asking Cook to invest in innovation, a sensitive subject in Washington, which wants to slow Beijing's tech march. The superpower competition is so intense that analysts sometimes speculate that it could spiral into war. Yet, the Apple chief vowed to “continue to grow its investments in China and help the high-quality development of the supply chain”.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>China Remains Un-Bypassable</strong></h2>

<p>Apple's overtures show how China, unlike India, remains an un-bypassable economy for global corporations. Which is why it is Apple that is wooing China, not the other way round. How the latter built itself up into a global manufacturing hub is well-documented and India is trying to emulate it in its own way. However, its ability to leverage market and production capacity access to learn and grow with the best in the world is severely limited.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For instance, Cook considered China so important, both as a manufacturing hub and market, that the company signed a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/facing-hostile-chinese-authorities-apple-ceo-signed-275-billion-deal-with-them">secret deal</a> in 2016 to invest $275 billion locally, including billion-dollar infusions in Chinese startups such as Didi. The Chinese government barely gave any concessions as Apple was fighting off a regulatory onslaught with the olive branch of investment. The pact was an unqualified success. Apple raked in the moolah as it rode the country's economic boom and citizens' prosperity. It became the phonemaker's largest market outside the US, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.businessofapps.com/data/apple-statistics/">bringing in</a> $378 billion in revenues between 2016 and 2022 even as it helped Chinese companies upgrade their technological capabilities.</p>

<p>In comparison, India bent over backwards to woo iPhone and iPad makers to set up shop here. It slashed import duties on components while keeping out finished products with high levies. This has now led to a situation where an iPhone made in India is cheaper in Dubai compared to Delhi. An iPhone 16 with a memory of 128GB costs about Rs 78,000 in a Dubai Mal, &nbsp;while it costs Rs 89,000 at the shiny Apple retail store in Delhi that Cook personally flew down to last year and flagged off. It took no time for the arbitrage to spawn a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/delhi-customs-seize-26-iphone-16-pro-max-worth-rs-40-lakh-from-woman-passenger-wrapped-in-tissue-at-igi-airport/articleshow/113869872.cms?from=mdr">smuggling</a> racket.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>India's Tortuous Duty Structures</strong></h2>

<p>iPhone smuggling may not cause much damage to the exchequer, but warped duty structures and perverse incentives distort the market so much that larger national objectives and development agenda are crumbling. Protectionist tariffs have stunted the growth and innovation in the solar industry. As this <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://carboncopy.info/price-surge-or-power-surge-indias-solar-conundrum/">three-part series</a> shows, India's renewable energy programme is weighing heavily on the finances of electricity distribution companies, ordinary consumers, and, ultimately, taxpayers. State-owned public distribution companies have accumulated losses of Rs 6.77 lakh crore.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Indian solar energy firms find it more profitable to import photovoltaic cells from China and assemble modules to ship to other markets as well as sell to local users. High import duties on modules but low levies on cells ensure wide margins for module makers and high costs for power distributors and end consumers. &nbsp;</p>

<h2><b>Relying On Just Arbitrage</b></h2>

<p>Such policies also have wider, unintended consequences. For instance, small manufacturers (read assemblers) use imported Chinese components in white-labelled goods and own brands to sell in regional markets. One such Maharashtra-based entrepreneur with a topline of about Rs 75 crore says that his products enjoy good margins and give bigger companies a run for their money. He keeps costs low by managing sales, operations, procurement and logistics, all by himself. Levies are fickle and an upward revision will squeeze margins and he does not want to risk raising costs by hiring specialists. That means the basis of his success is neither technological innovation nor organisational efficiency but arbitrage. It also means the duty structure intended to boost local manufacturing and job creation is merely promoting product assembly while generating few jobs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Earlier this month, the Tata Group-owned plant in Tamil Nadu that makes back panels for older models of the iPhone <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/apple-may-need-to-turn-to-china-after-tata-plant-fire-report-12833626.html">caught fire</a>. The unit is the only producer of the critical component, forcing iPhone maker Foxconn as well as the Tata Group (it assembles older models at another unit) to source the parts from China to meet global demand in peak festival season.&nbsp;<em>Bloomberg </em>reports that business was a key factor even in achieving a breakthrough in India-China border talks.</p>

<h2><strong>Why China Is Pacing Ahead</strong></h2>

<p>When Cook signed the secret deal in 2016, Apple vowed to localise component sourcing and stitch up deals with Chinese software firms, collaborate on technology with Chinese universities and directly invest in Chinese tech companies until 2022. It also committed to building research and development centres and renewable energy projects, <em>The Information</em> reported in 2021.</p>

<p>To be sure, Apple was not the only US company to sign such a deal. Microsoft and Cisco signed similar deals that helped local R&amp;D and innovation. The ecosystem they helped build no doubt contributed to bolstering the technological prowess of Chinese manufacturing. But, meanwhile, homegrown companies also developed their own expertise and breakthroughs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Chinese scientists have already <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/01/02/new-electrolyzer-to-split-saltwater-into-hydrogen/">built</a> an electrolyzer that can directly split seawater to produce hydrogen. A Beijing-based energy startup Betavolt <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.world-nuclear-news.org/Articles/Nuclear-battery-Chinese-firm-aiming-for-mass-mark">claimed</a> in January this year that it had built a commercially viable coin-sized nuclear battery that can power a mobile phone for 50 years. In 2023, the number of SMEs producing new and unique products using special and sophisticated technologies exceeded 70,000, according to the Report on the Work of the Government presented at the 14th National People's Congress. To compare, the number of technology SMEs in India is just over 10,000, as per Nasscom. Most of them are in software and do work for larger firms. This is not to say that there are no Indian companies doing advanced research and innovation. But they are few and far between, and are often starved of capital. Tata Sons at 207 is the only Indian company in the 2024 Patent 300 list, an annual <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://harrityllp.com/patent300/">global ranking</a> of innovators.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Indian Firms Need To Value Innovation</strong></h2>

<p>China offers liberal tax incentives to manufacturing companies and SMEs if they invest in R&amp;D. India, too, offers tax breaks up to 150%, but it's mainly used by Global Capacity Centres (GCC) of foreign companies because even large Indian firms rarely foster a culture of innovation. The R&amp;D tax break is one of the reasons, apart from the availability of cheap, high-quality talent, for the mushrooming of GCCs (over 1,600 now) in India. The knowledge and patents created, however, do not belong here.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Indian planning often tends to be short-termist. The government needs to holistically reassess its incentive structures to make the local industry truly independent and competitive in the long run.&nbsp;</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Travis Merrill, 51, has been charged with the murder of his co-worker Tamhara Collazo, at Allegiance Trucks, reportedly due to an obsession with her and frustration over her long work breaks. Merrill was arrested on Thursday after fatally shooting Ms Collazo at her desk, according to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.fox10tv.com/2024/10/22/man-accused-killing-his-co-worker-because-she-took-long-breaks-report-says/" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>Fox 10</em></a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Allegiance Trucks is located near the temporary headquarters of the Lewisville Police Department, allowing officers to respond within minutes, arrest Merrill, and attempt to save Ms Collazo's life.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Ms Collazo died from injuries at the hospital.&nbsp;</p>

<p>An arrest warrant obtained by <em>Fox News</em> revealed that Merrill had become increasingly angry over what he considered unauthorised long breaks by Ms Collazo and her lack of attention to him. Ms Collazo had even reported his behaviour to HR after telling him to stop watching her during breaks. Ms Merrill was required to see a counsellor before returning to work.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Upon his return, Ms Collazo avoided him, which further escalated Ms Merrill's anger. He admitted to detectives that he had begun buying guns and practising with them at home. On several occasions, he brought them to work but didn't act because it "didn't feel like the right time."</p>

<p>On the day of the shooting, Merrill followed Ms Collazo during her lunch break, watched her sit in the car like usual and went to his vehicle to retrieve two revolvers.</p>

<p>"As she re-entered after lunch, he followed her inside to her cubicle and 'ambushed' her, firing the gun several times," the affidavit says.</p>

<p>He's now being held in jail on a $10 million bond, the media outlet reported.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After avoiding an Estonian kidnapping plot, Australian cryptocurrency billionaire Tim Heath, who had previously maintained a low profile and was not well-known, has made headlines in all major media channels.</p>

<p>In late July, Mr Heath, who is rated 62nd on The Australian's 250 Rich List, was allegedly attacked at his flat in Tallinn, the capital of Estonia, but he was able to stop the attempted kidnapping.</p>

<p>Men wearing hi-vis vests and pretending as painter-decorators attacked the 46-year-old with the intention of kidnapping him and taking him to a distant hiding place.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/feature/delhi-metro-takes-down-check-your-oranges-ad-after-criticism-for-insensitivity-6863892"><strong>Also Read | Delhi Metro Takes Down "Check Your Oranges" Ad After Criticism For Insensitivity</strong></a></p>

<p>"It was only after a second-tier Tallinn Circuit Court hearing concerning one of the suspects, Georgian citizen Ilgar Mamedov, who had been held in custody since the attack and was requesting release, that the paper learnt of the kidnapping attempt, which was fortunately foiled as the target was able to fight off his assailants once they had pounced," <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.news.com.au/finance/work/leaders/beat-up-aussie-billionaire-fights-off-kidnappers-in-movielike-plot/news-story/c32a9538ecd5fc65dca9057047f6613c"><em>News Corp Australia</em></a> reported, translating a report by investigative weekly <em>Eesti Ekspress.</em></p>

<p>"The criminals had reportedly bought equipment they thought they needed from a hardware store days before and planned to take their victim to a remote hideout in the Kakerdaja bog, around 65 kilometres from Tallinn."</p>

<p>Fortunately, Mr Heath was able to "fight off his assailants once they had pounced" and occurred just over a week before the grand opening of his $100 million Bombay Club, a land-based casino for high rollers that features opulent gaming rooms, guest rooms, cigar lounges, and restaurants, according to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.news.com.au/finance/work/leaders/beat-up-aussie-billionaire-fights-off-kidnappers-in-movielike-plot/news-story/c32a9538ecd5fc65dca9057047f6613c"><em>News.com.au.</em></a></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Senior diplomat Sanjay Kumar Verma, &nbsp;envoy to Canada who was recently recalled, told NDTV today that there are some in Justin Trudeau administration who are anti-India and the Canadian Prime Minister is politically close to Khalistanis. Mr Trudeau, he added, is in a tight spot, so pleasing this particular constituency has become important. Khalistani extremism in Canada, he said in an exclusive interview to NDTV, is a business. The money generated is used to destabilise India and for these separatists to lead a lavish lifestyle. So once that is threatened, there are repercussions.</p>

<p>"There have been threats to Indian leaders and diplomats. He himself had been threatened, Mr Verma said. "Very recently &nbsp;Holi, i was portrayed as Ravan and my effigy was burnt. There was another poster where people would come and practise firearms on my face. Many things have gone on there which would not happen in a polite society that respects others," he added.</p>

<p>Regarding the Canadian Prime Minister, he said, "Trudeau's ratings are going down in Canada... (so) his actions against India are politically motivated".&nbsp;</p>

<p>"There are elements that want to hurt India-Canada ties... Many in Trudeau government are anti-India".</p>

<p>Mr Verma -- one of the country's senior-most diplomats who has served in Japan, Sudan, Italy, Turkey, Vietnam and China -- was recalled recently from Canada after the Trudeau administration &nbsp;accused him of being connected to the murder of Khalistani separatist Hardeep Singh Nijjar.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ties between the two nations - on a downward spiral since Mr Trudeau's allegation in September 2023 that Indian agents were responsible for the murder of Nijjar - have nosedived after the fresh allegation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It had led to strong statements from both sides and tit-for-tat expulsions by New Delhi and Ottawa.&nbsp;Mr Verma was declared "personna non grata" - a first for any Indian ambassador. &nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recalled Indian High Commissioner Sanjay Kumar Verma in an exclusive interview to NDTV today minced no words in strongly criticising Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau for sheltering Khalistani terrorists and gangs.</p>

<p>India withdrew Mr Verma from Canada after the Trudeau government linked him and some other Indian diplomats to the killing of Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar, and named the Indian envoy as a "person of interest" in the case.</p>

<p>"Canada has failed to limit hate speech by Khalistanis against India. Hate speech cannot be encouraged in the name of freedom of speech," Mr Verma told NDTV.</p>

<p>He said Canada's inaction against Khalistanis despite India's repeated requests and information sharing has "emboldened the extremists."</p>

<p>"The allegations made by the Trudeau government against India are bizarre. We have told them about the links between Goldy Brar and Lawrence Bishnoi. Goldy Brar openly runs extortion rackets in Canada," Mr Verma told NDTV. "He is the kingpin of all extortion rackets in Canada and some in Punjab," he added.</p>

<p>"Khalistanis run a business in Canada. They are into extortion. They use the money to live a lavish life and work against India," he said.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-10/a9mj06r_sanjay-kumar-verma_625x300_24_October_24.jpg?im=FeatureCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=1200,height=738" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>He said India had also strongly objected to Mr Trudeau inviting Khalistanis at events in Canada.</p>

<p>Canada sheltering Khalistanis has a political angle to it, Mr Verma said, alluding to Mr Trudeau's inaction against the terrorists.</p>

<p>India had slammed Canada for its disrespectful behaviour towards the recalled envoy - India's senior-most serving diplomat with a distinguished career spanning 36 years. "... The aspersions cast on him by the government of Canada are ludicrous and deserve to be treated with contempt," the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) had said.</p>

<p>The 2023 murder of Nijjar crashed diplomatic ties between New Delhi and Ottawa after Mr Trudeau said there were "credible allegations" linking Indian intelligence to the crime. India, which had designated Nijjar as a terrorist in 2020, has dismissed the charges as "absurd".</p>

<p>At the NDTV World Summit in Delhi earlier this week, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar had indicated that there would be some resistance from and churning in the West as India and other emerging economies grow. "It is not going to be smooth," Mr Jaishankar had said, in what was seen as alluding to Canada's behaviour towards India.</p>

<p>The West has to accept that changes and a rebalancing is happening in the global order which the West has got used to for a long time, he said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The station said its three AI avatars aim to engage younger audiences by discussing cultural, art, and social topics, including LGBTQ+ issues.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A radio station in Poland has sparked headlines after firing its journalists and relaunching with AI-generated "presenters". OFF Radio Krakow, based in the southern city of Krakow, recently introduced what it called "the first experiment in Poland" where virtual characters created by AI serve as journalists, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/10/24/media/polish-radio-ai-presenters-scli-intl/index.html" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>CNN </em></a>reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The station said its three AI avatars aim to engage younger audiences by discussing cultural, art, and social topics, including LGBTQ+ issues. In a statement, station head Marcin Pulit questioned whether AI is "an opportunity or a threat to media, radio, and journalism," promising to explore the issue further.</p>

<p>The move drew widespread attention after former host Mateusz Demski, a journalist and film critic, published an open letter condemning the replacement of human employees with AI. Demski, who had been with the station since February 2022, argued that the decision sets a "dangerous precedent" that threatens jobs in the media and creative industries. His petition protesting the changes had garnered more than 15,000 signatures by Wednesday morning.</p>

<p>Despite the backlash, Pulit claimed the layoffs were due to low audience numbers, not AI. Krzysztof Gawkowski, Poland's minister of digital affairs, also weighed in, calling for regulations on AI, stating that AI's growth should benefit people, not harm them.</p>

<p>The controversy intensified when the station aired an AI-conducted "interview" with a voice mimicking Nobel Prize-winning Polish poet Wislawa Szymborska, who passed away in 2012. Michal Rusinek, president of the Wislawa Szymborska Foundation, approved the use of her name for the broadcast, noting that the poet had a sense of humour and likely would have appreciated the experiment.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The Indian High Commissioner to Canada who was targeted by Justin Trudeau and has since been recalled by New Delhi reiterated today that "not a shred of evidence was shared" with him by the Canadian authorities.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Indian High Commissioner to Canada who was targeted by Justin Trudeau and has since been recalled by New Delhi reiterated today that "not a shred of evidence was shared" with him by the Canadian authorities who labelled him and five other diplomats as 'persons of interest' in the murder investigation of Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar.</p>

<p>Speaking exclusively to NDTV in his first interview since his return to India, Mr Verma said that it was in fact India which had shared detailed evidence of radical and extremist groups operating on Canadian soil with the Justin Trudeau government, but "no action was taken on it" by either the government or the authorities.</p>

<p>"Besides the evidence shared with Canada, New Delhi, through its High Commission, also repeatedly sent extradition requests for 26 radical elements and gangsters, but nothing was done about it by the," he said, adding that it is purely "double standards" by Canada, that "one law applies to you and another law applies to me, that doesn't work in the world anymore. In the past countries of the Global South would do as was told to them by the developed nations, but gone are those days," he said.</p>

<h2><strong>OUT OF THE BLUE</strong></h2>

<p>He revealed that in his last meeting with the Canadian authorities, it came as a surprise to him when he was informed by them that he and five other colleagues were now labelled "persons of interest" in the murder investigation and that they should "ask the Indian government to remove their diplomatic immunity".</p>

<p>"Throughout my tenure (as High Commissioner of Canada), my relations with all the ministries and with interlocutors were very cordial, But on October 12, all of a sudden, in a meeting with Canadian foreign ministry, I was informed that six of us were being linked to the murder investigation and for them to interrogate us, our diplomatic immunity has to be removed."</p>

<p>"Now that was going too far," he told NDTV, adding that he communicated this to New Delhi, which then decided to recall him and the other diplomats.</p>

<h3><strong>'DECLARED PERSONA NON GRATA'</strong></h3>

<p>"When the Government of India withdrew us, they (Canadian government) decided to label us as 'persona non grata' and be sent packing within a given timeline."</p>

<p>This is the first time in India's diplomatic history that any foreign ministry official or representative has been labeled a persona non grata, which means a person who is no longer welcomed, and in diplomacy, if the person concerned is not recalled by the home country as requested, the host state may refuse to recognize the person concerned as a member of the diplomatic mission - meaning their immunity ends.</p>

<p>Canada is considered a friendly country to India, but "Even in the case of Pakistan, where we have had known differences for decades, the last high commissioner to be recalled by New Delhi, my predecessor in Canada, Mr Ajay Bisaria, he remained a high commissioner who was called back and remained the then High Commissioner of Pakistan, even though he stopped residing in Pakistan."</p>

<h3><strong>'TRUDEAU'S CLAIMS WON'T STAND IN COURT'</strong></h3>

<p>"Not a shred of evidence has been shared with us (India). If they are calling intelligence inputs or source-based claims as 'evidence', then that will not stand in a court of law - not in their country, nor in ours," Mr Verma said.</p>

<p>What the Royal Canadian Mounted Police or RCMP said, and something that Trudeau said as well during his deposition to the court of inquiry on foreign interference, was that they do not have any proof or evidence, but rather intelligence inputs from sources - which is just hearsay.</p>

<p>"That is quite funny," said Mr Verma, adding that "what they have done is actually quite serious. As far as I understand most of the things they are calling evidence is just hearsay and source-based claims, and let's not forget that there are many India baiters there who are ready to give false statements against India or Indians, which could then be considered single sourced information."</p>

<h3><strong>COLLECTING INFORMATION - JOB OF A DIPLOMAT</strong></h3>

<p>Collecting information is a key part of a diplomats job. Explaining this, Mr Verma said, "Let me break this down for you. There are two ways in which information is collected by a diplomat - an overt way, which is through the open source, and a covert way. I can confirm to you here that yes, we depended on the information we got through open sources - the overt way."</p>

<p>"We collect information about banned organisations, radicals, extremists, etc from what is available through the news, through social media. So we did that, and we did the analysis based on the credible information we collected," he explained.</p>

<p>"And the trend seen in the analysis we made was very clear. They want to sabotage and destroy Canada India relations. They want India's image to be maligned internationally.</p>

<h3><strong>'JUSTIN TRUDEAU PERSONALLY INVOLVED'</strong></h3>

<p>"One thing is quite openly seen and known - that Mr Trudeau himself is known to be very close to the Khalistani extremists and terrorists, especially politically. Through his close circles, both in his cabinet and in the Canadian Parliament, some of his close friends are not quite inclined towards good Canada-India relations," Mr Verma said.</p>

<p>"I do not want to comment on the domestic politics in Canada, but what I have seen, heard and read in the media, is that his party is not doing well. The opinion polls are not in his favour, and most of all, Mr Trudeau's leadership is threatened even within party," Mr Verma added.</p>

<h3><strong>'KHALISTAN EXTREMISM IS A BUSINESS'</strong></h3>

<p>Explaining the way the Khalistan separatism works, Mr Verma said that "It is a business, because the money collected by these extremists and radicals through extortion and other illegal means, they use it in a continuous effort to destabilaze India and at the same time fund their personal, lavish lifestyles."</p>

<p>"So, if I am trying to give evidence of their illegal activities and try to shut down their business, then I become a subject of their target. And that is precisely what was seen when they openly threatened and targeted Indian diplomats in Canada," Mr Verma highlighted.</p>

<p>He went on to say that it is not just diplomats, "Our prime minister and home minister have been threatened, diplomats targeted. Some other examples are that effigies of Indian diplomats, including myself were burnt as Ravana, Cut outs of my face was made the target for shooting practice, and several other instances."</p>

<p>"You will not see such things happen so openly," and with support from the government "in any civil society," he said.</p>

<p>The diplomat further said that "When you show a bullet-ridden effigy of a former prime minister of the largest democracy, one that is your ally, with the images of her assassination and you cheer it openly then it is hate speech, not free speech."<br />

       <description><![CDATA[India's priority is not to impose its dominance but to enhance its influence, Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has said, asserting that no country, whether the US or China, can ignore New Delhi today.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>India's priority is not to impose its dominance but to enhance its influence, Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has said, asserting that no country, whether the US or China, can ignore New Delhi today.</p>

<p>Ms. Sitharaman made the remarks on Wednesday during a panel discussion on "Bretton Woods at 80: Priorities for the Next Decade" organised by the Center for Global Development here.</p>

<p>The minister arrived here on Tuesday to attend the annual meetings of the Bretton Woods Institutions -- the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.</p>

<p>"India's priority is not to impose its dominance, in the sense we are the biggest democracy we have in the world, the largest population, but to enhance its influence," she said.</p>

<p>Asserting that one in every six people in the world is an Indian, she said, "You just cannot ignore our economy and the way in which it is growing."</p>

<p>Ms. Sitharaman underscored that the course developed countries took, from producing textiles, cycles, bikes, etc, and reaching development, is "no longer available".</p>

<p>Questioning if India was in a position to define that path, she talked about the country's leading role in technology and how Indians have the system to run complex corporate set-ups.</p>

<p>"You really can't ignore it. Also, the geopolitical neighbourhood in which we live. No country, the US, which is very far away from us, or China, which is very close to us, can ignore us," she said.</p>

<p>During the discussion, she said that India has always "stood in favour of multilateral institutions" and added that it has followed policies of "strategic and peaceful multilateralism".</p>

<p>However, she highlighted that multilateral institutions are failing to produce viable solutions.</p>

<p>"We didn't want any time undermining any multilateral institution. But progressively we see the hope and the expectations which were pinned on multilateral institutions are frittered away because we think no solutions are coming out of them," she said.</p>

<p>"These institutions now are not offering an alternative pathway," she added.</p>

<p>She said that multinational institutions, with a wealth of information and experience, manpower, and human resources, should strengthen institutions for the global good, which is "very necessary" to strengthen multilateralism.</p>

<p>"We are in favour of multilateralism," Ms. Sitharaman added.</p>

<p>She stressed that the Bretton Woods institutions should work on this, rather than reacting to future developments.</p>

<p>"Unfortunately, in the last few decades, we see them reacting to future developments with the strength that they have. Therefore, information sharing is one thing," she said.</p>

<p>"India, of course, has an international solar alliance and biofuel alliance, and we're talking about disaster-resilient infrastructure. All these need money. All these need help for countries which are in smaller economies, island economies, which need them," she said.</p>

<p>"So, through the digital public infrastructure that we have publicly funded and taken up to different countries, we are spreading that attention. These are areas in which India will contribute," the Finance Minister said.</p>

<p>At a separate roundtable here, Ms. Sitharaman said that India has created the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (CDRI) to transform the infrastructure systems for resilience against natural disasters and adapt to climate change.</p>

<p>Chairing the Roundtable on Disaster Resilient Infrastructure, she stressed the danger of the development gains being undercut by increasing climate-induced risks to infrastructure and the critical services it supports.</p>

<p>Ms. Sitharaman said that over the years, India has ensured resilient economic growth by not only investing in hard infrastructure but also in building institutional capacity through creating national and state-level Disaster Management Agencies.</p>

<p>Reassuring India's commitment to sharing best practices during this resilience-building journey, the Union Finance Minister extended assistance to Global South towards shared challenges. She said that India looks forward to partnering with Africa and other developing countries to strengthen their resilience of infrastructure.</p>

<p>She added that under the G20 India Presidency, a Disaster Risk Reduction Working Group was created to increase commitment to disaster and climate-resilient infrastructure and to prioritise stronger national financial frameworks for disaster risk reduction.</p>

<p>The minister also participated in the Global Sovereign Debt Roundtable (GSDR).</p>

<p>In her intervention, she stressed improving timeliness, transparency and predictability, ensuring comparability of treatment among creditors and prioritising coordinated efforts to ensure low-cost, long-term financing and providing targeted technical assistance to strengthen fiscal capacity to build resilience in vulnerable countries.</p>

<p>Ms. Sitharaman called for a deeper dialogue to help countries meet debt obligations without compromising critical investments. She also cautioned against contingency financing instruments as they can result in deferred obligations, which can worsen future debt challenges.</p>

<p>She encouraged leveraging the GSDR's informal platform to better understand the perspectives of all parties, address concerns and provide informed guidance to countries on the risks and benefits of these instruments.</p>

<p>All eyes have been on Iran for more than a year. Naturally, the first BRICS summit with Tehran's membership is bound to breed speculation about what the prospective new world order would look like. At home, there needs to be an examination of India's bilateral ties with a country that is seen firmly anti-West in its outlook.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Iran and India are sailing in the same boat, at least momentarily: of the West's castigation. The temptation may be high on both sides to form a joint front against Western hegemony in the security space. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has held bilateral talks with the new Iranian President, Masoud Pezeshkian, with a focus on strategic cooperation in and beyond the Middle East.</p>

<h2><strong>Global Groupings vs Realpolitik</strong></h2>

<p>It can be endlessly debated without inching anywhere close to a resolution whether multilateral global groupings make any difference to realpolitik either domestically or internationally. The signalling, however, remains crucial. To begin with, the West is already perceiving the summit as Russia's show of strength. Headlines like 'Putin Gathers Allies' and 'Putin Hosts Global South Leaders at BRICS Summit Meant to Counterbalance Western Clout' in Western media outlets expose apprehension.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A complex interplay of sectarian interests and regional dynamics shapes Iran's geopolitical strategy. It is in the direct line of fire, thanks to Israel's unchecked belligerence. Already reeling under economic pressure owing to the UN sanctions of 2011, the post-October 7 reality for Tehran is even grimmer. Iran blames the US for almost all of its problems. As such, during the last summit, former president Ebrahim Raisi had anointed Iran's proposed BRICS membership as one of the ways of getting even with the US and the West at large. “Iran's membership in the bloc is opposition to American unilateralism.”</p>

<h2><strong>India Needs To Defines Its Position</strong></h2>

<p>Russia and China share this sentiment of BRICS emerging as a counterbalance to the West. But what about India? India has lauded and endorsed Iran's presence in BRICS, but will New Delhi also endorse Tehran's oppressive domestic policies in the name of this cooperative alliance?&nbsp;</p>

<p>India has not stopped buying oil from Iran despite the sanctions and disapproving remarks from the West. Yet, bilateral trade between the two countries has dropped by 26% in one year. Geoeconomics informs Iranian perceptions of the bloc as a critical driver. Iran aims to secure increased volumes of oil and non-oil exports to fellow BRICS members, bypassing the dollar.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Like Russia, Iran is engaged in a high-stakes battle with the West. China doesn't particularly enjoy a friendly status, either. New Delhi's balancing act, therefore, is set to be tested on many tricky issues in the near future, including the Israel-Palestine issue.&nbsp;</p>

<p>India has been an outlier in a manner. At the last UN General Assembly vote on a resolution calling for the end to Israel's occupation of Palestinian territories, India was the only founding BRICS country to abstain, along with the newcomer Ethiopia.&nbsp;</p>

<p>During the Modi-Pezeshkian bilateral, India was urged to play a more substantial role in the Middle East peace process. But what are New Delhi's realistic options? Calling for peace does not usher in peace; arm-twisting the stakeholders does.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>A Sticky Question For New Delhi</strong></h2>

<p>Any BRICS decision mandates unanimous agreement. In that sense, it is even trickier than the domestic coalition politics that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has found itself in the midst of after a decade. What will, for example, be India's stand should Iran want a revival of its nuclear plan? India's past tussles with the West over its own nuclear programme may trigger another round of strategic unpleasantness over New Delhi's stance.</p>

<p>India has a long-standing policy of strategic autonomy, and the complexity of its relations with the West is par for the course. The question is only of degree. The scope of India's support to its alliance partners in any overtures, real or perceived, against the West needs to be clearly defined, if not announced. While BRICS has achieved precious little in tangible terms in the past 15 years, the symbolism of grouping may have consequences for India as ongoing conflicts stretch into the future and new challenges around them emerge.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the internal dynamics of the expanded BRICS are going to pose another challenge. BRICS, only a little more than an ad hoc grouping with diverse challenges and interests, has miles to go to emerge as a counterforce to alliances like the G7 or the Five Eyes, where members have been able to thrash out at least a common minimum programme. &nbsp;</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin told a BRICS summit on Thursday that the Middle East was on the verge of full-scale war.</p>

<p>"The military action that started a year ago in Gaza has now spread to Lebanon. Other countries in the region are also affected," Putin told a meeting in Kazan attended by several world leaders.</p>

<p>"The level of confrontation between Israel and Iran has sharply risen. This is all reminiscent of a chain reaction and puts the whole Middle East on the verge of full-scale war," Putin said.</p>

<p>Violence in the Middle East will not end until the creation of an independent Palestinian state, Putin said at the summit, attended by Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas.</p>

<p>"The key demand for restoring peace and stability on Palestinian territories is carrying out the two-state formula approved by the UN Security Council and General Assembly," the Russian president said.</p>

<p>He added that this would be "correcting the historical injustice towards the Palestinian people".</p>

<p>"Until this question is resolved, it will not be possible to break the vicious circle of violence."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A former model has accused Donald Trump of groping and sexually touching her when they first interacted in 1993.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A former model has accused Donald Trump of groping and sexually touching her when they first interacted in 1993. Stacey Williams alleged that the incident was part of a "twisted game" involving Trump and sexual abuser Jeffrey Epstein, who introduced her to the former president.</p>

<p>Ms Williams, who began her modelling career in the 1990s, met Trump at a Christmas party in 1992 through Epstein, whom she described as a close friend of Trump. “It became very clear then that he and Donald were really, really good friends and spent a lot of time together,” she told <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/23/donald-trump-accuser-stacey-williams-jeffrey-epstein" rel="nofollow,noindex">The Guardian</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Epstein was later convicted with multiple allegations of sex trafficking and abuse of minors. He killed himself in prison in 2019.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The alleged groping occurred months later when Jeffrey Epstein suggested they visit Trump at his Manhattan residence. Upon arrival, Ms Williams claims Trump greeted her before pulling her closer and putting his hands all over her “breasts”, as well as her waist and buttocks. She claims to have frozen up and recalls being “confused” about what was happening. She remembers having seen the two men secretly smiling at each other after the incident.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Following the incident, Ms Williams and Epstein left Trump Tower, where she claims Epstein was "raging" at her. “Jeffrey and I left and he didn't look at me or speak to me, and I felt this seething rage around me,” she recounted. Epstein reportedly asked her, “Why did you let him do that?” Ms Williams described feeling “disgusting” and “confused” after the encounter.</p>

<p>“I felt shame and disgust and as we went our separate ways, I felt this sensation of revisiting it, while the hands were all over me. And I had this horrible pit in my stomach that it was somehow orchestrated. I felt like a piece of meat,” she said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Stacey Williams, now 56 and living in Pennsylvania, had previously shared snippets of her experience on social media but disclosed further details during a Zoom call organised by ‘Survivors for Kamala', a group supporting Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris. The call featured notable speakers, including actress Ashley Judd and legal scholar Anita Hill.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Donald Trump's campaign responded to Ms Williams' allegations through press secretary Karoline Leavitt, calling the accusations “unequivocally false” and suggesting they were politically motivated. “It's obvious this fake story was contrived by the Harris campaign,” she claimed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ms Williams, in an interview with The Guardian, shared a postcard from Trump sent to her agent later in 1993. It had an aerial view of Mar-a-Lago with the message, “Stacey – Your home away from home. Love Donald.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>The accusations against Trump add to a growing list of women who have alleged sexual misconduct by the former president, including instances of unwanted touching and harassment. A jury previously found Trump liable for sexual abuse in a case involving columnist E. Jean Carroll, awarding her $5 million.</p>

<p>Ms Williams explained, “I watched what has happened to women who come out, and it is so horrifying and abusive.”</p>

<p>Ms Williams confided in friends about the incident years ago. One of her friends recalled that she had shared the details of the groping in 2005 or 2006. “What I recall is that it was groping … what we would call feeling someone up,” the friend said.</p>

<p>Another friend recalled a conversation in 2015, shortly after Trump announced his presidential candidacy, where Ms Williams said, “He's vile, he groped me in Trump Tower.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Pushing for a permanent seat for India at the United Nations Security Council, External Affairs Minister Dr S Jaishankar today said established institutions must be reformed to create a more equitable global order.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pushing for a permanent seat for India at the United Nations Security Council, External Affairs Minister Dr S Jaishankar today said established institutions must be reformed to create a more equitable global order. He also reiterated Prime Minister Narendra Modi's message that this is not an era of war and global disputes must be resolved through dialogue and diplomacy.</p>

<p>Speaking at the 16th BRICS Summit in Russia's Kazan, Dr Jaishankar said, "BRICS is a statement of how profoundly the old order is changing. At the same time, many inequities of the past also continue. In fact, they have assumed new forms and manifestations. We see that in the access to developmental resources and modern technology and efficiencies. Let us also recognise that the benefits of globalisation have been very uneven. Adding to all that, the Covid pandemic and multiple conflicts have aggravated the burdens borne by the Global South. Concerns of health, food and fuel security are particularly acute."</p>

<p>The minister said the world is in danger of falling significantly behind in realising targets of sustainable development goals. "How do we create a more equitable global order? First, by strengthening and expanding platforms of an independent nature, and by widening the choices in different domains and minimising undue reliance on those that can be leveraged. This is really where BRICS can make a difference for the Global South," he said.</p>

<p>"Second, by reforming established institutions and mechanisms, especially the UN Security Council, in the permanent and the non-permanent categories. So too the multilateral development banks, whose working procedures are just as outdated as that of the UN," he added. India, Dr Jaishankar said, initiated an effort in this direction during its G20 Presidency and is glad to see Brazil take it forward.</p>

<p>A permanent seat at the UN Security Council has been India's longstanding demand. This demand is backed by major world powers, including the US, UK and France. Currently, China, France, Russia, the UK and the US are permanent members of the UN Security Council.</p>

<p>"Third, by democratising the global economy through creating more production hubs. The Covid experience is a sharp reminder of the need for more resilient and shorter supply chains. For essential needs, every region legitimately aspires to create their own production capabilities. Fourth, by correcting distortions in global infrastructure that are a legacy from the colonial era. The world urgently needs more connectivity options that enhance logistics and mitigate risks. This must be a collective endeavour for the common good, with the utmost respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty. And fifth, by sharing experiences and new initiatives. India's Digital Public Infrastructure, its Unified Payment Interface, the Gatishakti infrastructure all hold a larger relevance," he said.</p>

<p>The minister added that the International Solar Alliance, the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure, the Global Biofuel Alliance, Mission LiFE and the International Big Cat Alliance are initiatives of common interest. "As a First Responder, be it for natural calamities, health emergencies or economic crises, we seek to do our fair share."</p>

<p>Referring to the war in West Asia and Ukraine, Dr Jaishankar said addressing conflicts effectively is a particular need of the day. "Prime Minister Modi has emphasised that this is not an era of war. Disputes and differences must be settled by dialogue and diplomacy. Agreements, once reached, must be scrupulously respected. International law should be adhered to, without exception. And there should be zero tolerance for terrorism," he said.</p>

<p>"The situation in the Middle East, West Asia for us, is an understandable concern. There is a widespread anxiety that the conflict would spread further in the region. Maritime trade has also been deeply affected. The human and material consequences of further escalation are truly serious. Any approach has to be fair and durable, leading to a two state solution," the minister said, reiterating India's long-held stand on the Palestine issue.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk on Wednesday said the electric vehicle maker will roll out driverless ride-hailing services to the public in California and Texas next year, a claim likely to face significant regulatory and technical challenges.</p>

<p>"We think that we'll be able to have driverless Teslas doing paid rides next year," Musk said on Tesla's quarterly earnings call. He said Tesla currently offers an app-based ride-hailing service to employees in the San Francisco Bay Area.</p>

<p>His statement doubled down and expanded on a pledge he made at Tesla's robotaxi unveiling two weeks ago, where he said he expected to roll out "unsupervised" self-driving in certain Tesla vehicles in 2025. The lack of a business plan around the robotaxi at that event sent its stock plunging.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, however, Tesla won back some investor confidence by forecasting a jump in vehicle sales next year.</p>

<p>In California, in particular, the company will face an uphill climb in securing the needed permits to offer fully autonomous rides to paying customers.</p>

<p>Alphabet's Waymo, which offers paid rides in autonomous vehicles in the Bay Area and Los Angeles, as well as in Phoenix, Arizona, spent years logging millions of miles of testing before it received its first permit from the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC), which regulates ride-hailing services.</p>

<p>The California Department of Motor Vehicles, which regulates testing and deployment of autonomous vehicles in the state, told Reuters that Tesla last reported using its autonomous vehicle testing permit in 2019. That permit requires a safety driver.</p>

<p>The company does not have, and has not applied for, a testing permit without a driver, the agency said.</p>

<p>Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.</p>

<p>As for the ride-hailing service in the Bay Area for employees, CPUC said Tesla does not need a permit, because employees are not considered passengers.</p>

<p>At Tesla's robotaxi event on Oct 10, Musk unveiled a two-seater, two-door "Cybercab" without a steering wheel and pedals that would use cameras and artificial intelligence to navigate roads.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, he acknowledged the potential difficulties in California, saying "it's not something we totally control," but adding "I would be shocked if we don't get approval next year."</p>

<p>Ross Gerber, a Tesla shareholder and CEO of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth and Investment Management, said "dealing with regulators is a very difficult process" and that no one should consider it "a walk in the park."</p>

<p>Texas has far fewer regulatory requirements for autonomous vehicles than California, but companies often test for months or years before deploying paid services.</p>

<p>Rules around deployment of autonomous vehicles are largely left to individual states. Musk on the call said there should be a "national approval process for autonomy."</p>

<p>Tesla's advanced driver assistance system, called Full Self-Driving (FSD), which is the bedrock for Tesla's robotaxi ambitions, has faced questions from regulators.</p>

<p>Last week, the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) opened an investigation into 2.4 million Tesla vehicles equipped with FSD after four reported collisions, including a 2023 fatal crash.</p>

<p>Still, the idea of Tesla rolling out a robotaxi fleet sent shares of ride-hailing apps Uber and Lyft down 2.3% in post-market trading.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Artist Eugene Gladenko has created a dozen murals around Kyiv to commemorate soldiers killed fighting Russian forces.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Liudmyla Bordus lost her son Maksym to the war with Russia, but he is never far away - his likeness emblazoned in vivid colour across her apartment building in Kyiv.</p>

<p>"I can feel him every day, every time I pass him here," she said, stroking the spray-painted image.</p>

<p>"I greet him in the morning and in the evening, always."</p>

<p>The sweeping mural of the 23-year-old former boxer is one of a dozen around the Ukrainian capital created by artist Eugene Gladenko to commemorate troops killed fighting Russian forces.</p>

<p>Moscow's February 2022 invasion galvanised Ukrainians, who have memorialised their fallen in myriad ways. Billboards tower over highways and plaques adorn village schools where soldiers studied.</p>

<p>Gladenko, 31, said he is motivated by love of country and a calling to "create comfort" for Ukrainians who have lost loved ones. Many of his creations are deeply personal, he added, ordered by relatives or friends.</p>

<p>"Every story ... is a story of a hero, an example for their entire district or neighbourhood," said Gladenko, whose own friend was killed in the war.</p>

<p>Bordus acknowledged that the image of Maksym, who was killed in southeastern Ukraine last June when a tank shell struck his trench, is painful.</p>

<p>But she added that it was a potent reminder of the sacrifice made by Ukrainian troops like her son.</p>

<p>"It feels as if an angel is looking at you from above."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Microsoft bought the game's publisher Activision-Blizzard a year ago for $69 billion in the sector's biggest takeover.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Microsoft's ambition to become the "Netflix of video games" faces a huge test this week with the release of "Call of Duty: Black Ops 6" on Friday. The US software giant bought the game's publisher Activision-Blizzard a year ago for $69 billion in the sector's biggest takeover.</p>

<p>Activision's prized asset was the "Call of Duty" franchise, one of the world's best-selling games, and Friday's release will be the first in the series to be available from day one on Microsoft's Xbox Game Pass subscription service.</p>

<p>The game will also be available to PlayStation users -- as well as on PC.</p>

<p>Mat Piscatella from analyst firm Circana told AFP it was "the biggest push" anyone had made to bolster a subscription platform.</p>

<p>Video game companies once made their money from selling hard copies of their games to players who were plugged into consoles.</p>

<p>But the industry now gets its profits from in-game sales and subscriptions on a model like Netflix or Disney+.</p>

<p>"How consumers react may result in a dramatic industry shift to -- or away -- from the subscription model," said Piscatella of the "Call of Duty" release.</p>

<h3><strong>'Something for everyone'</strong></h3>

<p>Microsoft is not messing about with its ambitions for Game Pass.</p>

<p>It has a target of 100 million customers by 2030.</p>

<p>But the industry has slowed since the boom-time of the pandemic when much of the world spent time confined to their homes.</p>

<p>As of February this year, Game Pass had around 34 million subscribers.</p>

<p>For Friday's release, Microsoft has rejigged its pricing and only subscribers to the most expensive "Ultimate" tier will get the game as it launches.</p>

<p>Despite the vital importance of the game to Microsoft's business, the makers were keen to promote the strengths of the game itself.</p>

<p>"There's really something for everyone with Black Ops 6," Stephanie Snowden, communications head at Call of Duty Studios, told AFP on the sidelines of a promotional event in London.</p>

<p>Players are plunged into an alternate reality of conspiracy and paranoia during the 1991 Gulf War.</p>

<p>But she insisted the game was not saying anything about contemporary divisions in the United States, or the forthcoming presidential election.</p>

<p>"We consider it like a giant blockbuster moment and entertainment moment of the year," she said. "But we're not sending any kind of political message."</p>

<h3><strong>'Cherry on top'</strong></h3>

<p>The saga has generated more than $30 billion in revenue worldwide in a little over 20 years.</p>

<p>But Brian Comiskey of the Consumer Technology Association, an industry group, said Microsoft got more than just a straightforward gaming title when it bought Activision.</p>

<p>"It's not just a game, it's a community," he told AFP.</p>

<p>The first "Call of Duty" games were pioneers by allowing many players to join the same game online.</p>

<p>Many of those players have grown up together, playing the game with each other no matter where they are in the world.</p>

<p>"Video gaming is a social media platform and Call of Duty has been doing that for a very long time," said Comiskey.</p>

<p>So these older players may well get involved even if the game itself is not so impressive.</p>

<p>"The interest isn't necessarily always the content," he said. "That's just a cherry on top."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Britain will ban single-use vapes from next year, a government minister said on Thursday, seeking to crack down on the environmental harm and rising usage levels among children.</p>

<p>Health authorities have raised concerns about the use of vapes among young adults, with their colourful designs and fruity flavours making them stand out on grocery store shelves. According to a 2024 survey by health charity ASH, about one in five children aged 11-17 said they had tried vaping.</p>

<p>It is illegal to sell nicotine-containing e-cigarettes to anyone under the age of 18 or for adults to buy them on behalf of under-18s.</p>

<p>The plan to ban disposable vapes was initially set out by the previous Conservative government in January but was not implemented before the July election, which was won by the Labour Party.</p>

<p>Labour's culture minister said that the number of children vaping had tripled in the last three years, and that disposable vapes were causing a lot of problems for the environment.</p>

<p>"We have been increasingly concerned," she told Sky News.</p>

<p>"We hope (this) will help to break this cycle where children are getting into the habit of vaping at younger and younger ages."</p>

<p>The government's Department For Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs (Defra) did not immediately respond to a Reuters' request for details on the measure. Media reports said the ban was due to come into force in June.</p>

<p>A separate study by ASH this year said vapes were the most popular aid to quitting among tobacco smokers, with nearly 3 million people in Britain having quit smoking with a vape in the last 5 years.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In Greece, one of the world's largest chestnut producers, farmer Anestis Altinis searches for nuts suitable for harvest. But after months of searing heat and drought, most have not ripened, a familiar problem in his village where output is expected to drop 90%.</p>

<p>"I don't remember this happening before," said Altinis, a third-generation chestnut producer in Kissos village on Mount Pelion in central Greece.</p>

<p>"We have reached almost the end of the harvest season and the chestnuts remain on the trees," he said.</p>

<p>The chestnut harvest in Greece is expected to drop to about 15,000 tonnes in 2024 because of the extreme weather, half the average over the past five years, according to George Nanos, a professor of Pomology at the University of Thessaly.</p>

<p>Greece exports most of its chestnuts to Europe and the Balkans where they are used in confectionery and cooking.</p>

<p>The drop in production comes after Greece's warmest winter and summer on record and is the latest sign of the impact of climate change on crops across southern Europe. Drought conditions in Spain, Portugal and France already bode ill for yields of various crops in those countries.</p>

<p>Chestnut producers in Thessaly, a region accounting for about a quarter of Greece's agricultural output, including chestnuts, say some areas haven't experienced rainfall for 13-months after floods in September 2023 decimated the area.</p>

<p>"This year, the situation is tragic," Nanos said. "We have dead or very damaged trees, with very little production."</p>

<p>Cherry, apple and walnut harvests have also been hit, farmers and scientists said.</p>

<p>That's a bad sign for Greece, where agricultural products account for a fifth of its total exports, and whose economy is still recovering from a decade long debt crisis.</p>

<p>In a recent report, Greece's central bank said it expects crop and fruit prices to rise in the coming years due to climate change. It sees the financial impact of climate change exceeding 1% of economic output annually in the coming years, up from about 0.2%-0.3% on average in the past decade.</p>

<p>For farmer Altinis, picking chestnuts with his grandfather shaped his childhood and paved his future. But the fall in output is driving people away.</p>

<p>He urged authorities to help with irrigation or risk desertification in some areas.</p>

<p>"If they don't produce chestnuts, the villages will shrink, the mountain will be deserted," he said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>India, a country "dear" to the world's computer industry, is set to witness 20 times growth in compute capacities in 2024, and will soon be exporting impactful AI solutions, Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang said on Thursday.</p>

<p>Speaking at the Nvidia AI Summit 2024 here, Huang emphasised Nvidia's commitment to expanding its ecosystem in India.</p>

<p>"India is very, very dear to the world's computer industry, central to the IT industry, at the centre and core of the IT of just about every single company in the world.</p>

<p>"Nvidia's ecosystem in India is very rich; 2024 will see a a 20 times growth in compute capacities in India," he said.</p>

<p>Huang described the current state of the industry as undergoing a "seismic change" due to AI advancements and suggested that India, which has traditionally been a hub for software exportation, is poised to become a leader in AI exportation in the future.</p>

<p>"India exported software; in the future, India will export AI," he said, pointing towards the country shifting from merely being a back office for software production to becoming a powerhouse in AI development and delivery.</p>

<p>"India has focused on being a back office to produce software, the next generation of it will be of producing and delivering AI. It will be dramatically more impactful," he asserted.</p>

<p>"In the long term, I am hoping that all of us have our own AI co-pilots," he further said.</p>

<p>Addressing concerns about job displacement, Huang asserted that while AI will not eliminate jobs outright, it will fundamentally change how they are performed.</p>

<p>"AI will absolutely not take away a job, but the person who uses AI to do a job better will take away the job," he said.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The pinnacle of Joe Biden's presidency was day one in Oval Office, when he confidently declared "America is back". He had said that as America rejoined the Paris climate agreement—an optimistic promise to reclaim global leadership. The lowest point of his Presidency was October 7, 2023, when Hamas launched its brutal attack on Israel. It was a stark reminder that American influence and security assurances, once taken for granted, were no longer what they used to be. It's the journey between those two dates that has come to define the chequered legacy of the 46th President of America.</p>

<p>Biden's credibility has gone up in flames in West Asia and he is in danger of leaving behind a dark legacy that his successor would try to erase from the pages of history. But his failures on other issues have also been shocking.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, let's start with his sunshine moments first.</p>

<h2><strong>A Hero's Welcome In Germany</strong></h2>

<p>Last Friday, Biden tiptoed into Germany, almost unnoticed, to receive the country's highest civilian award for his contribution to trans-Atlantic relations. The world's most powerful leader shuffled along next to German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier; their slow, tentative steps felt as though a ghostly presence was tagging along—a moment straight out of T.S. Eliot's <em>The Waste Land</em>: "Who is the third who always walks beside you?"</p>

<p>Biden's farewell visit to Germany comes with a cloud of unease looming over Europe. The spectre of Donald Trump, their ‘tormentor-in-chief' so to speak, &nbsp;possibly returning to power has made Berlin and Europe jittery. They remember Trump's views on NATO all too well, which had left the European members wondering whether the US was serious about protecting Europe against a potential Russian attack.</p>

<p>The elusive third figure in Eliot's poem could just be Europe's collective dread of a Trump redux. Steinmeier still carries the scars from those years (2016-2020), recalling a time when the US-Europe bond was fraying. "...just a handful of years ago, the distance had grown so wide that we almost lost each other," he reminisced. Thankfully, to Germany and Europe's collective relief, Biden was quick to restore Europe's faith in the trans-Atlantic alliance “literally overnight”, as the German President said.</p>

<p>Surely, Biden's European outreach and climate action were two of the very few successes of his presidency.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Biden, Blinken and Bibi &nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p>As Israel continues to pound Lebanon and Gaza, one thing is glaringly obvious: the US influence on Israeli decision-making has been greatly cut down since the October 7 Hamas attacks. Sure, Israel's military might squash terrorist threats for now. But lasting peace? That's unlikely and uncertain. Meanwhile, the US Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, is in West Asia again, but he, like his boss, is taken seriously neither by Benjamin aka ‘Bibi' Netanyahu nor by Arab allies. Biden has lost his credibility in the region as an honest peace broker largely due to his weak handling of Netanyahu and letting daily massacres in the region continue. If war breaks out in West Asia, Biden might just hand Kamala Harris's campaign its own little farewell party.</p>

<p>Trump had at least got Israel to sign the Abraham Accords Peace Agreement between Israel and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Bahrain and Morocco. These agreements aimed to normalise diplomatic relations, expand economic cooperation, and promote regional peace and stability. What does Biden have to show for? The deal with Saudi Arabia was almost ready to be signed, but the Hamas attacks pushed it back. And so far, Biden hasn't been able to persuade the warring parties to come to a ceasefire agreement in Gaza and Lebanon.</p>

<h2><strong>Abraham Accords, A Flawed Trump Legacy</strong></h2>

<p>The Abraham Accords had come as a beacon of hope for West Asia. I even remember watching an interview with American-Israeli rabbi Yaakov Israel Herzog, who had parked himself in Saudi Arabia, boldly declaring his plan to open the first Jewish community centre in Riyadh. Saudi rulers just pretended not to notice. Everyone assumed the peace deal with Israel was practically signed, sealed, and delivered. Jews visiting the Kingdom? That was almost possible, and it would have been some achievement.</p>

<p>But here's the thing—the Abraham Accords had overlooked the Palestinian issue. Normalising relations without even mentioning Palestinian self-determination was, in hindsight, unwise. That's a recipe for fragile peace. The real issues—borders, settlements, Jerusalem, refugees—were left out of purview. And let's not forget, the Palestinian leadership wasn't even invited to the table. A peace deal without the main player was myopic, at best.</p>

<p>Granted that Biden inherited a diplomatic mess and an uphill battle. He was supposed to dive into the deep end, fix the flaws in the Accords and put the Palestinian issue back on the agenda. But he didn't. The result was Hamas's deadly October attack. Now, the world has been left calling, once again, for a renewed focus on Palestinian statehood.</p>

<h2><strong>A Host Of Other Failures</strong></h2>

<p>Whoever gets the keys to the White House next will inherit the dilemma of either trying to bring order to West Asia, which could overshadow US priorities in Europe and China, or dealing with all the Biden failings simultaneously. There is no doubt that Biden's legacy in West Asia is in tatters; it carries the baggage of extreme violence, death and destruction. Thousands have died, including women and children, millions have been rendered homeless, and a big number have migrated to safer countries. The Israelis, escaping the war, have been flooding into Cyprus. Many in the region believe it will take generations for the scars to be erased. One wonders whether Biden will ever reflect on his failures once he leaves the White House.</p>

<p>Biden's approach to China has also faced scrutiny. His administration's efforts to establish a coalition of like-minded nations, which included India, have yielded mixed results. The Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF) and the Quad security dialogue have been touted as key initiatives, but their effectiveness remains uncertain. China's growing economic and military influence has significant implications for global governance and regional stability.</p>

<h2><strong>Ukraine: Pumping In Money Without A Goal</strong></h2>

<p>Ukrainians are dreading Donald Trump;'s possible return to power because he has made it clear he would strike a peace deal with Russia. He is also not in favour of the US pumping in billions of dollars and sending plane-loads of weapons to Ukraine. The Ukrainians would thus like Kamala Harris as President, as they believe she will carry on defending Ukraine and continue to help it with cash and weapons.</p>

<p>Under Biden, Pax Americana, the era of America-led global order, has been showing clear signs of decline. From the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan to the US's impotency in West Asia, Biden's foreign policy has often been seen as reactive rather than proactive. The cowardly pullout from Kabul in 2021, which left behind chaos and emboldened the Taliban, sent a message that US military power no longer guarantees stability in the regions it occupies. This failure, followed by Washington's inconsistent handling of alliances, signalled a retreat from the role of a ‘global enforcer' that the US has played since World War II.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>The China-Russia Question</strong></h2>

<p>Clearly, Biden's response to the rising influence of China and Russia has been less than robust, weakening American hegemony. While efforts like the Quad alliances aim to counterbalance China's assertiveness in the Indo-Pacific, Beijing continues to expand its influence through economic investments, military posturing, and diplomatic and multilateral efforts such as the Belt and Road Initiative and BRICS. Simultaneously, Russia's invasion of Ukraine has drawn attention to the limits of US deterrence.</p>

<p>The decline of Pax Americana may not have started under Biden, but it certainly accelerated under him. Domestically, Biden's presidency has focused on economic recovery, social justice, and climate action. The American Rescue Plan and Inflation Reduction Act have helped stabilise the economy and address social issues to some extent. However, bipartisan cooperation has been more elusive than ever, and many of Biden's initiatives have faced resistance from Congress.</p>

<p>If Donald Trump wins on November 5, Biden's legacy could be swept into the dustbin of history. But if Kamala Harris comes out on top, she will have to work very hard to salvage it—while defining her own legacy.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gisele Pelicot, whose ex-husband and dozens of other men are on trial in France accused of raping her while she was drugged, told the court Wednesday she was "broken" by her ordeal, but also determined to "change society" for sex assault victims.</p>

<p>The 71-year-old has become a feminist icon in France since the trial of Dominique Pelicot and 50 other men opened last month in the southern French city of Avignon.</p>

<p>The case has sparked horror, protests and a debate about male violence in French society, with the country keenly following the harrowing testimonies in court.</p>

<p>"I am a woman who is completely broken," Gisele Pelicot told the court in her second address to the court on Wednesday.</p>

<p>But she expressed her "determination to change this society" in terms of how it deals with sexual assault.</p>

<p>Gisele Pelicot insisted from the start that the trial should be open to the public to draw attention to the use of drugs to commit sexual abuse.</p>

<p>And she has encouraged other women who have been sexually assaulted to come forward.</p>

<p>"I wanted all women who are rape victims to say to themselves: 'Mrs Pelicot did it, so we can do it too'," she said.</p>

<p>"It's not us who should feel shame, but them (the perpetrators)", she said.</p>

<p>Gisele Pelicot addressed the court on Wednesday at the invitation of presiding judge Roger Arata, who asked for her "impressions" of the trial so far.</p>

<p>"I don't know how I'm going to rebuild myself," she said. "I'm 72 soon and I'm not sure my life will be long enough to recover from this."</p>

<p><strong>'Immeasurable betrayal'</strong></p>

<p>She then addressed her former husband who was sitting in the dock without looking at her, asking him to explain what made him drug her over almost a decade, rape her and enlist strangers to do the same.</p>

<p>"I'm trying to understand how my husband, who was the perfect man, became like this. How my life changed. How you could allow these people into our house knowing that I disliked swinging.</p>

<p>"For me, this betrayal is immeasurable. After 50 years together... I used to think I was going to be with this man until the end."</p>

<p>She added, looking steadily at her husband, who looked away: "I always tried to lift you higher. You plumbed the depths of the human soul, but unfortunately you made your own choices."</p>

<p>Her ex-husband, also 71, remained seated without any apparent reaction bar lowering his eyes.</p>

<p>His six other co-defendants whose cases are being studied by the court this week likewise stayed silent, surrounded by their counsels.</p>

<p>Gisele Pelicot, who was greeted with applause by the audience as she arrived Wednesday, has attended the trial most days.</p>

<p>In mid-September, she dropped her usual reserve to talk of her humiliation and her anger towards several lawyers who had made insinuations about her ordeal.</p>

<p>"A rape is a rape," she said.</p>

<p><strong>Abuse on film</strong></p>

<p>Dominique Pelicot filmed much of the abuse against his then-wife and also took meticulous records of the strangers visiting their home, which subsequently helped police uncover the crimes.</p>

<p>He has admitted to drugging her and inviting men to rape her between 2011 and 2020.</p>

<p>But he insists he is no different from the dozens of other men he recruited online to take part in the sexual abuse, alleging they all knew what they were signing up for.</p>

<p>Many of his co-defendants deny this, accusing him of manipulating them into raping his spouse of half a century.</p>

<p>Forty-nine other men are accused of raping or attempting to rape Gisele Pelicot -- with nearly none of them admitting guilt.</p>

<p>One has admitted to sedating his own spouse so that he and Dominique Pelicot could sexually assault her.</p>

<p>The trial is scheduled to last until December.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

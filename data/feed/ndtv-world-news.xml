       <description><![CDATA[The beluga dubbed the "spy whale," was wearing a harness with a small camera and a buckle marked with "Equipment St Petersburg."]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The well-known white beluga whale suspected of being a Russian spy may have been guarding "Kremlin property" when it was found dead off Norway's coast, according to a new <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m002504p" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>documentary</em></a>.</p>

<p>The whale, nicknamed Hvaldimir-a combination of the Norwegian word for whale, hval, and the name of Russian President Vladimir Putin- was found floating in Risavika Bay in southern Norway in September. Fishermen first spotted the 14-foot whale near Ingoya in northern Norway in April 2019.</p>

<p>The beluga dubbed the "spy whale," was wearing a harness with a small camera and a buckle marked with "Equipment St Petersburg," fueling suspicions of its role as a spy, the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/nov/10/new-film-unravels-mystery-of-the-russian-spy-whale" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>Guardian </em></a>reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After a 10-month investigation, the BBC documentary Secrets of the Spy Whale uncovered evidence suggesting Hvaldimir may have been trained as a covert "guard whale." Speaking to <em>The Observer</em>, film director Jennifer Shaw noted, "Our findings about Hvaldimir's potential role bring us closer to solving the mystery, but they also raise further questions about what Russia might be guarding in the Arctic, and why."</p>

<h2><strong>How do animals become guards?</strong></h2>

<p>The documentary team consulted a former dolphin trainer and experts from an early US Navy program to understand how animals could serve as guards. Blair Irvine explained that dolphins can detect the bubbles and noise created by swimmers, making them highly effective at tracking intruders due to their sensitive hearing.</p>

<p>Shaw explained that Hvaldimir was likely trained similarly and was seen using his nose to target specific objects, hinting that he may have been used for security patrol rather than espionage.</p>

<p>On September 1, Hvaldimir was found dead, and some animal rights groups initially suggested he had been shot. However, an autopsy revealed a 35 cm by 3 cm stick lodged in his mouth and some superficial injuries, but Norwegian police found no evidence indicating he was shot. "There is nothing in the investigations to suggest that human activity directly caused Hvaldimir's death," police stated.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump has chosen Republican Representative Elise Stefanik to serve as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, the president-elect said in a statement shared with Reuters on Monday.</p>

<p>"I am honoured to nominate Chairwoman Elise Stefanik to serve in my Cabinet as U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations. Elise is an incredibly strong, tough, and smart America First fighter," Trump said.</p>

<p>Stefanik, a New York representative and House Republican Conference chair has been a fierce Trump ally.</p>

<p>She could not be immediately reached for comment.</p>

<p>Trump said on Saturday that former Republican presidential contender Nikki Haley and former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will not be asked to join his administration.</p>

<p>Haley served as the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations under Trump during his previous term and had endorsed Trump for president despite having criticized him harshly when she ran against him in the party primaries.</p>

<p>Trump is meeting with potential candidates to serve in his administration before his Jan. 20 inauguration as president.</p>

<p>Reuters reported Friday that Trump met with prominent investor Scott Bessent, who is a potential U.S. Treasury Secretary nominee.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The flight headed to Shenzhen, China, encountered trouble when a bird strike caused an engine failure.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Hainan Airlines flight that departed from Fiumicino Airport in Rome, Italy, was forced to turn back shortly after takeoff due to a fire on board. The flight headed to Shenzhen, China, encountered trouble when a bird strike caused an engine failure. Italian Coast Guard officials reported that the bird strike posed a threat to the aircraft's 249 passengers and 16 crew members.</p>

<p>While bird strikes are relatively common, they can be dangerous, especially if they impact an engine. Fortunately, the Boeing 787 Dreamliner safely returned to Fiumicino after dumping fuel over the sea. Despite the emergency landing, there were no reported delays to air traffic, according to an Italian airport official. Italian sources indicate that the plane will undergo thorough checks to assess the extent of the damage, as flames were visible on the right engine while the aircraft was in the air.</p>

<p>The Dreamliner 787-9, bound for Shenzhen, took off at 9:55 a.m. local time and managed a safe landing following the incident. Bird strikes with aircraft are not rare; last year, The Mirror reported a similar case where a pilot was left covered in blood after a bird shattered his windscreen mid-flight.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dominica, a Caribbean Island nation, has faced significant natural disasters, particularly hurricanes and tropical storms. In 2015, Tropical Storm Erica caused severe flooding, landslides and widespread destruction, leaving thousands homeless and costing the island millions in damages. In 2017, Hurricane Maria, a Category 5 hurricane, devastated Dominica, destroying nearly all infrastructure, homes and agriculture, and killed dozens. The island experienced extensive power outages, water shortages, and disruptions in healthcare and education. Dominica's economy, heavily reliant on agriculture and tourism, was severely impacted. But the island nation always showed remarkable resilience and progress - something that its Prime Minister Dr Roosevelt Skerrit highlighted on Sunday.</p>

<p>"After Hurricane Maria, everybody said Dominica is finished and guess what today? The world cannot talk about resilience unless they talk about the Commonwealth of Dominica," he said at the Dominica Labour Party Delegates Conference in Vieille Case.</p>

<p></p>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p></p>

<p>Dr Skerrit also said that the country surprised the world by rebuilding Dominica "in 24 months" as against the expected and widely publicised 20 years.</p>

<p>"We have tackled them head on, not with fear, but with the determination that defines us as leaders," the Dominican Prime Minister said at the conference, according to a report in <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://wicnews.com/dominica/world-cannot-talk-about-resilience-unless-they-talk-about-dominica-pm-skerrit"><em>WIC News</em></a>.</p>

<p>Initiatives like climate resilience project, emergency agricultural livelihoods and housing recovery program, launched by his administration, restored hope and renewed the strength of the country.</p>

<p>Out of these, the housing programme is the "envy of the world", said Dr Skerrit adding that the Labour Party has always placed the people of Dominica at the centre of its policies and their journey together is far from over.</p>

<p>"Our work is not over. We're here today not only as a political party but as a family with deep roots in the history of our beloved Dominica. It is our shared struggle that has brought us victories. Victories that have improved the lives of our people. Our health care and education to infrastructure and social protection of the vulnerable. Our senior citizens and children," said the Prime Minister.</p>

<p>Dr Skerrit emphasised that Labour is an inclusive party, and all are welcome to be a part of it.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Deep in a thick forest in Italy's northwestern Piedmont region, the hunt is on for the white Alba truffle, with excited dogs zigzagging and digging into the wet earth.</p>

<p>But the culinary treasure is becoming increasingly rare, undermined by climate change.</p>

<p>"Go find it! Where is it?" Carlo Marenda, a part-time truffle hunter, calls out to Gigi and Buk, seven month-and 13-year-old crosses between the Spinone Italiano and Lagotto Romagnolo breeds, prized for their keen sense of smell.</p>

<p>Autumn leaves crunch under the weight of boots sinking into muddy soil. Below a picturesque hillside vineyard, not far from Alba, trails wind along the Rio della Fava, crossing damp ground ideal for growing truffles.</p>

<p>Sought after by gourmets and starred chefs around the globe, the white truffle of Alba, the most prestigious in the world, is an underground fungus growing in symbiosis with certain hardwood trees by attaching itself to their roots.</p>

<p>Its intense and refined scent, a mixture of hay, garlic and honey, allows hunting dogs to detect it, even if the truffle is sometimes buried up to a metre deep.</p>

<p>Introduced to truffle hunting at the age of five by a family friend, Carlo Marenda, 42, founded the "Save the Truffle" association in 2015, alongside Edmondo Bonelli, a researcher in natural sciences.</p>

<p>It was an octogenarian "trifulau" loner, Giuseppe Giamesio, known as "Notu" and the last descendant of a family with a century-old truffle tradition, who revealed his secrets to him and bequeathed his dogs just before his death in 2014.</p>

<p>The master's message was a testament: "If we want to prevent the disappearance of the truffle, we must protect the forests, stop polluting the waterways and plant new 'truffle' trees".</p>

<p>Ten years later, thanks to donations and the support of some winegrowers, the association has planted more than 700 such trees in the hilly Langhe area, including poplars, oaks and lindens.</p>

<p><strong>Notu's legacy</strong></p>

<p>"Notu passed on to me his passion for truffle hunting and tree preservation," said Marenda, emerging from his metallic grey Fiat Panda 4X4, the preferred car of truffle hunters.</p>

<p>In the last three decades, the areas dedicated to white truffles in Italy have dropped by 30 per cent, gradually giving way to more profitable vineyards, but also hazelnut groves.</p>

<p>The Langhe hills provide a large quantity of hazelnuts to the chocolate giant Ferrero, which was founded in 1946 in Alba, a small prosperous town of 30,000 inhabitants.</p>

<p>But the main threat to the white truffle, whose harvest was classified as an intangible heritage of humanity by UNESCO in 2021, is climate change.</p>

<p>Global warming, drought, deforestation and sudden temperature changes are all factors weakening the natural habitat of this fungus.</p>

<p>To survive, the truffle needs cold and humidity. At the beginning of November, however, the temperature was at 20 degrees Celsius (68 degrees Fahrenheit).</p>

<p>"With the prolongation of summer weather, production is definitely falling", he lamented.</p>

<p><strong>Soaring prices</strong></p>

<p>The harvest, running from October to the end of January, is getting shorter. And with the delayed cold and snow to arrive, "the aroma of the truffles is not yet 100 per cent and they don't keep as long", Marenda said.</p>

<p>Abundant rain, as seen in recent weeks, can also be harmful, he said.</p>

<p>"If there is too little water, the truffle does not grow. If there is too much, it rots."</p>

<p>Alerted by Buk, Marenda crouched down to the ground to delicately scratch the earth with a narrow spade, extracting a truffle, albeit rather modest in size.</p>

<p>On whether the white truffle is on the brink of extinction, experts say it isn't too late.</p>

<p>"Not yet. But if we don't act, it could become so," said Mario Aprile, president of the Piedmont truffle hunters' association.</p>

<p>"The white truffle cannot be cultivated, unlike the black one. Without trees, there are no truffles. We plant them to rebuild biodiversity," Aprile said.</p>

<p>Faced with limited supply and booming demand, the white truffle is trading at a high price, reaching 4,500 euros per kilo this year at the International Alba White Truffle Fair, which ends December 8.</p>

<p>Two "twin" white truffles, bound to the same root and dug up by Aprile, were the stars of the annual world charity auction for white truffles in Alba Sunday.</p>

<p>Weighing a total of 905 grams (2 lbs), the fungi were sold for 140,000 euros ($150,000) to a Hong Kong finance tycoon.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Computer users have been searching "Are Bengal cats legal in Australia?" after falling victim to an unusual cyber attack, the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/09/tech/hackers-are-targeting-people-who-type-these-six-words-into-their-computer/" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>New York Post</em></a> reported.&nbsp;Cybersecurity firm <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2024/11/06/bengal-cat-lovers-in-australia-get-psspsspssd-in-google-driven-gootloader-campaign/" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>SOPHOS </em></a>issued an urgent alert on its website, warning people against entering this specific phrase into search engines. Reports indicate that those who search this question and click on certain links at the top of the results risk having their data stolen.</p>

<p>"Victims are often lured into clicking on malicious adware or links disguised as legitimate content, or in this case, a standard Google search," explained SOPHOS in a release.</p>

<p>Currently, the dangerous links only appear when the term "Australia" is included, putting Australian users at the highest risk. After clicking one of these seemingly legitimate search results, users may have personal information, like bank details, stolen through a program called Gootloader, which can also lock them out of their computers.</p>

<p>While searching about Bengal cats may seem harmless, SOPHOS notes that this makes the hacking risk even more alarming, as it shows that even innocuous search terms can lead to data theft.</p>

<p>The company warns that cybercriminals are increasingly using a tactic known as "SEO poisoning," manipulating search engine results to elevate their malicious websites. The Daily Mail describes this as an "insidious technique" where criminals optimize their websites to appear prominently in search results.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pakistan's Punjab province banned most outdoor activities and ordered shops, markets and malls in some areas to close early from Monday to curb illnesses caused by intense air pollution.</p>

<p>The province has closed educational institutions and public spaces like parks and zoos until Nov. 17 in places including Lahore, the world's most polluted city in terms of air quality, according to Swiss group IQAir's live ratings.</p>

<p>The districts of Lahore, Multan, Faisalabad and Gujranwala have seen an unprecedented rise in patients with respiratory diseases, eye and throat irritation, and pink eye disease, the Punjab government said in an order issued late on Sunday.</p>

<p>The new restrictions will also remain in force until Nov. 17.</p>

<p>"The spread of conjunctivitis/ pink eye disease due to bacterial or viral infection, smoke, dust or chemical exposure is posing a serious and imminent threat to public health," the Punjab government said.</p>

<p>While outdoor activities including sports events, exhibitions and festivals, and dining at restaurants have been prohibited, "unavoidable religious rites" are exempt from this direction, the order said.</p>

<p>Outlets like pharmacies, oil depots, dairy shops and fruit and vegetable shops have similarly been exempted from the directions to close by 8 p.m. local time.</p>

<p>Lahore's air quality remained hazardous on Monday, with an index score of more than 600, according to IQAir, but this was significantly lower than the 1,900 that it touched in places earlier this month.</p>

<p>A score of 0-50 is considered good.</p>

<p>UNICEF on Monday also called for greater efforts to reduce pollution and protect children's health in Punjab, saying that more than 11 million children under five years of age are in danger as they breathe the toxic air.</p>

<p>"In addition, schools in smog-affected areas have been closed...the learning of almost 16 million children in Punjab has been disrupted," said Abdullah Fadil, UNICEF Representative in the country.</p>

<p>"Pakistan, already in the grips of an education emergency...cannot afford more learning losses," he said.</p>

<p>Several parts of South Asia are engulfed by a toxic haze each winter as cold air traps dust, emissions and smoke from farm fires.</p>

<p>Punjab has blamed its toxic air this year on pollution wafting in from India, where northern parts have also been battling hazardous air, and has said it will take the issue up with the neighbouring country through its foreign ministry.</p>

<p>India's Supreme Court on Monday directed the Delhi government to decide by Nov. 25 on imposing a perpetual ban on firecrackers, legal news portal Bar and Bench reported.</p>

<p>Firecrackers set off by revellers on Diwali, the Hindu festival of lights celebrated on Oct. 31 this year despite a ban, have aggravated the region's pollution problem.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p class="ins_instory_dv_caption">(1962) A Mi-4 in the Galwan Valley, as seen from the Chinese side.</p>
</div>

<p data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody" dir="ltr">It was August 1962. The Alpha company of 5 Jat was in Chushul when it received a directive to take control of Hot Springs. It was never the plan to send the Alphas further down from there, to Galwan. Major Ajit Singh's Bravo company was to take that post. However, when he insisted that his company remain at Hot Springs, the task befell the Alphas. And that is how, in October, about 60 soldiers arrived at the Galwan post: unexpectedly and without much preparation.</p>

<p data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody" dir="ltr">Numerous difficulties would beset the Alphas at Galwan. Apart from heavy snowfall, Chinese posts closed off the land route completely. The post was entirely dependent on air supplies, which meant that on occasion, supplies would also land on the enemy side. The Chinese also kept up their attacks to demoralise the Alphas by circling the posts and yelling propaganda slogans like <em>‘Hindi Chini Bhai Bhai'.</em></p>

<p dir="ltr">The Jats prepared four posts in the complex: the company headquarters with one section under Major Srikant Sitaram Hasabnis, a platoon under Subedar Hoshiar Singh, another section under Naik Inder Singh, and a post comprising the remaining men under Subedar Nihal Singh. There was no communication between these posts. Supplies were in limited numbers too, with 16 soldiers reportedly lacking any kind of weaponry. Even the radio communication between the headquarters of the company and that of the battalion was only as per schedule. Every soldier was scared and felt as though they had been thrown into a death trap.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>When Bullets Rained</strong></h2>

<p dir="ltr">A week passed eventlessly after the last soldier landed in Galwan. But it was an eerie peace, not to last too long. In the early hours of October 20, Major Hasabnis, who was in his tent then, heard a machine gun being fired at his post. As he peeked outside, he was met with a barrage of firing from the Chinese side.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">In no time, firing from all directions engulfed the area. Bullets from rifles, machine guns, and artillery were pelting the ground. Major Hasabnis approached the tent with the radio to alert the battalion and brigade headquarters that they had been attacked by the Chinese. Except, it was radio silence period at the headquarters, which meant that there was no one to alert or ask for help from. The Alphas, thus, with no contact with the outside world, were now left to tackle the Chinese all by themselves.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The remaining company positions were out of sight. Amid heavy gunfire, a company headquarters soldier was seen sitting outside, in the open. Someone questioned him, "Why are you doing this?" He replied, "<em>Intezaar, Saab</em>" ("Waiting, Sir"). One of the 16 unarmed men, he was waiting for the shot that would kill him. Even Major Hasabnis had but just a pistol on him.</p>

<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Deterred By Nothing</strong></h2>

<p dir="ltr">Subedar Nihal Singh's post was also pounded. After the shelling stopped for a while, the infantry launched a battalion-sized assault on the forward defences. Troops kept fighting from their crumbling defences, and amidst that, Nihal Singh went from man to man, encouraging them to fight till the end.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">Not too far away, the JCO was fatally wounded in shelling. Upon noticing this, Sepoy Bhopal Singh immediately ran to him, gave him aid, and moved him to a safe location. He found his LMG-1 severely wounded when he returned to his trench. Even so, he took control of the weapon and dealt severe casualties to the enemy. Ultimately, when he was left with only grenades, he lobbed them at the enemy defiantly, causing numerous fatalities. Eventually, however, as the front-line defences crumbled completely, Bhopal Singh was killed.</p>

<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Fighting Till The End</strong></h2>

<p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, Major Hasabnis, in the rear position, continued to take on the Chinese with his remaining troops. Captain Doctor HN Paul was advised to exit the tent and enter the trench. But before he could do so, the tent caught fire due to an incendiary round; he was presumed to have died. Company Havildar Major Banwari Lal, who was charged with organising ammunition, was also killed by a shell when he was sprinting to supply ammo.&nbsp;</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Left, Major S.S. Hasabnis, and right, Subedar Nihal Singh" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-11/u207i6k8_hasabnis_625x300_11_November_24.jpg" title="Left, Major S.S. Hasabnis, and right, Subedar Nihal Singh" /></div>

<p class="ins_instory_dv_caption">Left, Major S.S. Hasabnis, and right, Subedar Nihal Singh</p>
</div>

<p dir="ltr">Subedar Hoshiar Singh's isolated location wasn't spared either. Although the initial wave of the attack was repelled, the sheer extent of it was overwhelming. It was clear to Singh that it was a dire moment. After his LMG operators sustained fatal injuries, he personally fired the weapon and took on the adversary, before being shot.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Naik Inder Singh's weak section also took on a four times larger enemy valiantly. The section gave it all it had, but after an hour, when they had nothing left, they fell, with the enemy taking on their position.</p>

<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>When The Chinese Seized The Post</strong></h2>

<p dir="ltr">The hail of gunfire ended quickly, just as it had begun. Unsettling silence suddenly descended over the Galwan complex. Hand-to-hand combat broke out as soon as the adversary closed. Soldiers who were hurt could be heard screaming. After several hours of fighting, the Chinese took complete control of the post, killing 30 Indian soldiers, including Dr. Paul. Eighteen men suffered serious injuries.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">The men fought until the last bullet was shot. And even though they knew death and defeat were staring them in the eye, they did not raise the white flag of surrender. Major Hasabnis and his surviving soldiers were taken prisoner by the enemy. Galwan had been seized. Subedar Nihal Singh and one OR died in captivity, while Sepoy Roshan Lal lost his limbs.</p>

<p dir="ltr">On October 21, Chinese soldiers again opened fire on Indian helicopters as they flew over the Galwan position. The pilot, after seeing no sign of life at the post, concluded that every single man had either been killed or taken prisoner.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">It was only in May 1963 that the captives were finally repatriated. Among them, Subedar Nihal Singh was posthumously awarded Vir Chakra in recognition of his bravery and leadership.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Qatar's suspension of its crucial mediation between Israel and Hamas has crushed hopes for a long-stalled truce in the Gaza war and hostage release deal.</p>

<p>The wealthy Gulf country hosts the largest US base in the Middle East and Hamas's political office, and has played a pivotal role in indirect talks since the October 7 attack on Israel that sparked the war.</p>

<p>The negotiations offered the only hope for freeing Israeli hostages held by Hamas and ending a war that has left 43,603 people dead in Gaza, according to a toll from the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory.</p>

<p>But Qatar announced last week that it has put its mediation on hold until Israel and Hamas show "willingness and seriousness" to end the conflict.</p>

<p><strong>- Where do talks stand? -</strong></p>

<p>Since a one-week pause in fighting last year, when scores of hostages were released in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, successive rounds of negotiations have made no headway.</p>

<p>This month, Hamas rejected a proposal from Egypt and Qatar for a short-term truce, as it did not offer a lasting ceasefire.</p>

<p>Israel has repeatedly vowed it will not stop fighting until it achieves its war objectives -- to crush Hamas and bring the hostages home.</p>

<p>While Egypt borders Gaza and the United States is Israel's main backer, Qatar's role in the talks was unique in that was the only player able to claim neutral ground.</p>

<p>It has mediated numerous international crises in Ukraine, Syria and Afghanistan.</p>

<p>Negotiations on Gaza need a broker, and "I can't see how that would be anyone else," says Andreas Krieg, a senior lecturer at King's College London.</p>

<p>The talks are "now in a situation where there is no negotiation process anymore", he added.</p>

<p>Hamas has been weakened by the killings of leaders Yahya Sinwar in October and Ismail Haniyeh in July, to a point where it is unclear "how you maintain a negotiation process with all the main interlocutors dead", he said.</p>

<p>Anna Jacobs, a Gulf analyst with the International Crisis Group think tank, said "Hamas feels they already agreed to a US ceasefire plan over the summer".</p>

<p>But that proposal never produced an agreement.</p>

<p>Jacobs said Hamas thinks Israel is "sabotaging negotiations by constantly adding on new conditions", including keeping a military presence in Gaza.</p>

<p><strong>- Could Hamas leave Qatar? -</strong></p>

<p>Qatari foreign ministry spokesman Majed Al-Ansari on Saturday pushed back against reports suggesting that Hamas would be ejected from the country.</p>

<p>The "main goal of the (Hamas) office in Qatar is to be a channel of communication", Ansari said, adding that it had "contributed to achieving a ceasefire in previous stages".</p>

<p>A senior Hamas official told AFP that the group had received no indication from Qatar that it should leave.</p>

<p>Earlier, a diplomatic source told AFP that with Qatar pulling back in its mediation role, the Hamas office "no longer serves its purpose".</p>

<p>Given the Hamas and Qatari denials, Jacobs said that "it's unlikely that there will be a big, public closing of the Hamas office and kicking out the leadership."</p>

<p>Qatar gave Hamas a similar message in April, prompting several group members to leave for Turkey -- only to return two weeks later at the request of the United States and Israel, when negotiations proved unworkable.</p>

<p>Krieg said Hamas now appeared to be in "limbo" and that demands were mounting for expulsion in "a fairly short window of maybe a few weeks", with the most likely destination being Iran.</p>

<p>Turkey has been touted as a new host but the NATO member is unlikely to want to upset the United States, Krieg added.</p>

<p>According to Jacobs, it is possible that until US President-elect Donald Trump's January 20 inauguration, "Hamas officials will stay out of Doha until more serious negotiations resume".</p>

<p><strong>- Will Qatar bow out for good? -</strong></p>

<p>Qatar had already signalled its unhappiness in April when it said it was re-evaluating its mediator role.</p>

<p>But it has signalled its willingness to return to the table when conditions permit.</p>

<p>"This is primarily about... signalling to the world, we are mediating, we're happy to continue it, but we're also willing to put all the weight, all the leverage that we have over Hamas," Krieg said.</p>

<p>Jacobs said Qatar's relationship with Hamas had come under scrutiny from American policymakers, especially Republicans in Congress.</p>

<p>"It makes sense that they are trying to protect themselves and preemptively remove any vulnerability that Trump and a likely Republican-controlled Congress could attack," she said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A thick toxic blanket of smog covering eastern Pakistan and entire northern India is seen in a striking satellite image released by American <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://worldview.earthdata.nasa.gov/?v=64.49116547151472,25.4299555277525,81.23650026844116,33.3752680277525&amp;s=74.3507,31.558%2B77.2188,28.6324&amp;t=2024-11-10-T00%3A00%3A00Z">space agency NASA</a>. It shows location pins for Lahore in Pakistan's Punjab and New Delhi, with both cities under huge cloud of grey smog. Lahore - a city of 14 million people stuffed with factories on the border with India - regularly ranks among the world's most polluted cities, but it has hit record levels this month.</p>

<p>Last week, live rankings by Swiss group IQAir gave the city a pollution index score of 1165. In New Delhi and neighbouring areas, it is hovering around 350. An Air Quality Index (AQI) of 50 or below is considered good with little risk of pollution.</p>

<p>The hazardous level of pollution has forced authorities in Pakistan to close schools till November 17 in a bid to lower children's exposure to the pollution.</p>

<p>In Multan, another city of several million people some 350 kilometres away, the AQI level passed 2,000 last week, according to news agency AFP.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Access to parks, zoos, playgrounds, historic monuments, museums and recreational areas has <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/pakistans-punjab-shuts-amusement-parks-museums-for-10-days-due-to-severe-smog-6977921">also been banned</a> along with tuk-tuks with polluting two-stroke engines and restaurants that operate barbecues without filters.</p>

<p>A "smog war room" has been set up in Pakistan's Punjab province where staff members from eight departments work towards controlling burning of farm waste and managing traffic.</p>

<p>A mix of low-grade fuel emissions from factories and vehicles and agricultural stubble burning blanket the city each winter, trapped by cooler temperatures and slow-moving winds.</p>

<p>According to World health Organisation (WHO), air pollution can trigger strokes, heart disease, lung cancer and other respiratory diseases.</p>

<p>It is particularly punishing for children and babies, and the elderly.</p>

<p>The chief pollutant is PM2.5, the fine particulate matter that poses greatest risk to health. It comes from sources like the combustion of fossil fuels, dust storms and wildfires, and has been linked to asthma, heart and lung disease, cancer, and other respiratory illnesses, as well as cognitive impairment in children.</p>

<p>PM2.5 travels deep into lung tissue where it can enter the bloodstream.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Reports have been flooding in of Black people across the United States receiving disturbing text messages referencing slavery and "picking cotton", following Donald Trump's presidential election win. These racist messages have been reported in over a dozen states, including California, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Michigan, North Carolina, Virginia, and Alabama, as per <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/09/us/racist-texts-black-people-investigation-what-we-know/index.html"><em>CNN.</em></a>&nbsp;The messages, sent anonymously, instructed recipients to report to a "plantation" or board a bus, sparking widespread alarm and prompting investigations by the FBI and other agencies.</p>

<p>The messages often instruct recipients to report to a specific address, sometimes mentioning the incoming presidential administration. Some even target children, with reports of middle school students receiving these hateful messages. For instance, a 16-year-old girl in California received a text directing her to report to a "plantation" in North Carolina.</p>

The threat — and the mention of slavery in 2024 — is not only deeply disturbing, but perpetuates a legacy of evil that dates back to before the Jim Crow era, and now seeks to prevent Black Americans from enjoying the same freedom to pursue life, liberty, and happiness,'' NAACP President and CEO Derrick Johnson<strong>&nbsp;</strong>said in a<em> <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://naacp.org/articles/naacp-president-condemns-racist-text-messages-sent-black-americans-across-country">press release.</a>&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>Whoever is sending the racist text messages is using anonymizing software to obscure their location, Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill told CNN on Friday.&nbsp;</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Calling it "completely false", Moscow today rejected claims of a phone call between Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump last week. A report by US's Washington Post had claimed on Sunday that Trump had called up Putin, and that the two leaders had discussed the conflict in Ukraine.</p>

<p>"This is completely false information," Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said today, adding that there has been no phone call whatsoever, between the Russian President and his US counterpart.</p>

<p>In its report, now flagged as 'fake news' by Moscow, The Washington Post had claimed that Donald Trump had called Vladimir Putin from his residence-cum-resort Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida. The call was reportedly made on Thursday, a day after Trump and his close aide Elon Musk had spoken to Ukraine's Zelensky.</p>

<p>According to the Washington Post report, which was based on 'anonymous sources familiar with the matter', Trump had allegedly "reminded Putin" of America's sizable military presence in Europe. The report went on to claim that Trump had allegedly expressed an interest in further conversations with Putin to discuss "the resolution of Ukraine's war soon."</p>

<h2><strong>DONALD TRUMP CALLS UKRAINE'S ZELENSKY</strong></h2>

<p>Notably, in his victory speech after the 2024 US Election result was declared last week, Donald Trump had said that "I will not start wars, I will help end them", and within a few days of winning the presidential election, President-elect Trump had called his Ukrainian counterpart Zelensky.</p>

<p>After the phone call last Wednesday, President Zelensky had shared a post on X which read: "I had an excellent call with President Trump and congratulated him on his historic landslide victory - his tremendous campaign made this result possible."</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-08/cl3gesag_trump-musk_625x300_13_August_24.jpeg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>Notably, that phone call was attended by Elon Musk too. Elon Musk was with Donald Trump at the President-elect's residence and luxury resort Mar-a-Lago. During the phone call, Donald Trump reportedly <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/donald-trump-asks-elon-musk-to-join-call-with-ukraines-zelensky-in-big-hint-at-his-possible-role-6976601" target="_blank">handed the phone over to Elon Musk</a> and supposedly asked the SpaceX founder to join the call with President Zelensky.</p>

<p>It is not known yet, if they discussed any change in policy the United States has towards Ukraine.</p>

<p>According to the news report by Axios, there were two surprises that day - the first being that Elon Musk spoke with Zelensky, and the second, that Zelensky was reportedly "somewhat reassured by what he heard." This shows just how important and influential a role Elon Musk could end up playing in the Trump administration 2.0.</p>

<h3><strong>ELON MUSK'S POSSIBLE ROLE</strong></h3>

<p>The report further stated that the phone call between Trump, Musk, and Zelensky lasted for nearly half-an-hour. After being congratulated by Zelensky, Mr Trump reportedly said he will support Ukraine, but didn't reveal much else.</p>

<p>Elon Musk then reassured President Zelensky that he will continue to help Ukraine via his Starlink satellite constellation. Since the Russian invasion in 2022, Elon Musk's Starlink satellite system has provided Ukraine with significant frontline advantage by allowing its armed forces to share real-time drone coordinates, data and footage between units. It also gave Ukraine's military communications support in areas where mobile phone networks were destroyed.</p>

</div>

<p>Zelensky and Trump had met recently in New York on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly meet in September. The two leaders had discussed ways in which the war with Russia could end and a diplomatic solution be found. "I promise you will be happy with me," Trump had reportedly told Zelensky at that meeting.</p>

<h3><strong>PUTIN AND ZELENSKY'S DEMANDS</strong></h3>

<p>The Russian president had recently demanded that Ukraine withdraw from swathes of its eastern and southern territory as a precondition to peace talks. The Washington Post reported that people familiar with "Thursday's call" said Trump had briefly raised the question of land with Putin.</p>

<p>President Zelensky has said there should be "no concessions" to Putin. Ceding land or giving in to any of Moscow's other hard line demands would only embolden the Kremlin and lead to more aggression, President Zelensky had said.</p>

<p>The outgoing Democratic administration of President Joe Biden has confirmed that it will send as much aid as possible to Ukraine before Trump's inauguration on January 20.</p>

<p>On Sunday, Biden's National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said the White House aims "to put Ukraine in the strongest possible position on the battlefield so that it is ultimately in the strongest possible position at the negotiating table."</p>

<p>This would include using the remaining $6 billion of funding for Ukraine available, Mr Sullivan said.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Toy manufacturer Mattel has apologised for mistakenly printing the web address of an adult site on the packaging of dolls released in tie-up with the new Wicked movie. The company said it was taking “immediate action” in this regard.</p>

<p>Over the weekend, the Wicked film merchandise became a nightmare for the company after people started sharing images of the dolls' packaging on social media, highlighting how it shows a link to '<a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://wicked.com&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1731400754787000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2pA5Xlffn8OwYyA2-4PmJc" href="http://wicked.com/" target="_blank">wicked.com</a>', instead of '<a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://wickedmovie.com&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1731400754787000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0n2dobdvQX14zmJsC4J8RC" href="http://wickedmovie.com/" target="_blank">wickedmovie.com</a>', <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/nov/11/mattel-apologises-after-mistakenly-linking-to-porn-website-on-wicked-dolls">The Guardian</a> reported.</p>

<p>The link was printed on the boxes of Glinda and Elphaba dolls -- the two lead characters in Wicked, played by Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo in the film adaptation.</p>

<p>Addressing the error, Mattel released a statement on Sunday and said, "Mattel was made aware of a misprint on the packaging of the Mattel Wicked collection dolls, primarily sold in the US, which intended to direct consumers to the official WickedMovie.com landing page".</p>

<p>The company noted that it "deeply regrets this unfortunate error" and was taking immediate action to remedy this.&nbsp;Further, it advised parents that the "misprinted, incorrect website is not appropriate for children."</p>

<p>"Consumers who already have the product are advised to discard the product packaging or obscure the link and may contact Mattel customer service for further information," the statement added.</p>

<p>It seems that the misprint on the dolls' packaging affected the ones being sold on platforms like Target, Kohls and Amazon, the film's official retail partners.</p>

<p>On Amazon's US website, these dolls have now been listed as “currently unavailable”. The collection included fashion dolls, singing figurines as well as deluxe collectible models.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/wicked-dolls-mattel-mistakenly-link-to-adult-porn-site-1236058013/">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, the entire Mattel-manufactured doll collection was no longer available on Target by Sunday afternoon.</p>

<p>It added that products, having misprinted websites, are present on eBay for sale, anywhere between $100 to $800.</p>

<p>Directed by Jon M. Chu, the adaptation of the popular Broadway musical is all set to hit screens in the US on November 22.</p>

<p>The epic musical fantasy film also features Jonathan Bailey, Ethan Slater, Bowen Yang, Marissa Bode, Peter Dinklage, Michelle Yeoh and Jeff Goldblum.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Netherlands Police are using an innovative life-size hologram of a sex worker, killed in Amsterdam in February 2009, to uncover new information about the cold case and bring her killer or killers to justice. The hologram has been placed behind a window in Amsterdam's Red Light district. Sitting on a stool, it looks at people passing by and appears to knock on the window. The glass fogs up, while the word “help” appears on it, <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/10/europe/dutch-police-hologram-sex-worker-cold-case-intl/index.html">CNN</a> reported.</p>

<p>The hologram is modelled on Bernadett Szabó, known as Betty, who was found murdered in the Dutch capital in 2009.&nbsp;Created using 3D visualisation technology, it also features a large dragon tattoo covering Betty's stomach and chest.</p>

<p>A house in the area has been dedicated entirely to Betty's murder, with large stickers on the windows and TV screens showing the crime scene, a documentary and images of the woman.</p>

<p>This holographic has been created to reach out to people, who may have knowledge about the murder case but did not come forward at the time of the incident.</p>

<p>In the official statement, Benjamin van Gogh, coordinator of the Amsterdam Wanted and Missing Persons Team, noted that it was "difficult to determine what it takes to get possible witnesses, in this case, to share their information with us”.</p>

<p>“Betty's hologram may create a certain connection with her and thus convince a person to come forward. In this type of case, we always try to put a face on a victim, so that informants know who they're doing it for, and the hologram is a way of taking this a step further," CNN quoted the official as saying.</p>

<p>In a statement, the Dutch police said that Szabó was born and brought up in poverty in the Hungarian city of Nyíregyháza, before shifting to Amsterdam at the age of 18. After landing in the city, she began earning money as a sex worker in the red light district. After becoming pregnant, she continued to work throughout her pregnancy and later gave birth to a son in November 2008. The child was later placed with a foster family.</p>

<p>Betty was found dead on the night of February 19, 2009, when two of her fellow sex workers reached her workroom on Oudezijds Achterburgwal. They realised they didn't see her or hear the music she usually played. At around 1 AM, they found her body stabbed dozens of times. She was 19,<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/10/dutch-police-use-hologram-to-try-to-solve-2009-sex-worker-killing"> The Guardian </a>reported.</p>

<p>For the past 15 years, police carried out a large-scale investigation into the case, monitoring CCTVs and interviewing witnesses. The case remained unsolved.</p>

<p>The reward for any information related to the case has been hiked to €30,000 (around $32,160).</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Sabae, a small city in Japan's Fukui Prefecture, has earned the title eyeglasses capital' for producing over 90% of the nation's frames.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sabae, a small city in Japan's Fukui Prefecture, has earned the title ‘eyeglasses capital' for producing over 90% of the nation's frames. Sabae offers visitors an opportunity to explore the craft behind its spectacles.</p>

<p>The city's journey into the eyeglass industry began in 1905 when a local government official invited skilled artisans to the city to create new economic opportunities for farmers. This initiative has since flourished, and today, the city is home to over 100 companies specialising in eyeglass production, according to a report on <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/travel/sabae-eyeglasses-capital-of-japan-fukui-hnk-intl/index.htm">CNN</a>.</p>

<p>The process combines cutting-edge technology with the expertise of skilled artisans. That it is still largely manual sets the city apart from so many other parts of the world known for its expertise in the industry. Takeshi Yamae, a frame designer for the Japanese company Boston Club, says a single pair of glasses may need more than 200 steps. “From the time I start designing, to the time I have the perfect product, it takes more than a year. I start by thinking about who I want to wear it. I often get inspiration from very Japanese things, for example, houses, gardens and tableware,” Yamae says.</p>

<p><strong>Why visit Sabae?</strong></p>

<p>Though frames created by Sabae are found across Japan, there's something unique about the city and seeing the process firsthand. Some artisans who work on the frame production process focus exclusively on one expertise throughout their careers, including machine cutting, polishing or nose pad attachment.</p>

<p>“Everyone in factories in Sabae wants to make beautiful, high-quality products that can be used around the world,” Yamae adds.</p>

<p>The Megane Museum in Sabae offers visitors an in-depth look at the craft, with displays illustrating the numerous stages of frame creation. The museum also hosts workshops where tourists can design and create their frames — an ideal souvenir. For those short on time, the museum shop offers thousands of frames from around 50 local manufacturers.</p>

<p>Apart from this, visitors can also explore the city's eyewear-themed street signs, exhibits, and events, further cementing Sabae's reputation as the eyeglasses capital.</p>

<p>Recent upgrades to transportation have made it simpler than ever to visit Sabae. A new bullet train extension, launched in 2024, connects the Hokuriku region with Tokyo, making Sabae and Fukui province more accessible to international tourists. The extension includes a stop at Fukui Station, where visitors can easily reach Sabae.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-11/7lgvhhno_trump_625x300_11_November_24.jpg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>It's no surprise that many Indians—including some former diplomats—are celebrating Donald Trump's reelection. After all, Trump's bond with India, and particularly with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, was the envy of many countries and leaders during his first term. Granted, some might say they were mere optics: remember appearances at rallies like “Howdy, Modi!” and “Namaste, Trump!” in Houston and Ahmedabad?</p>

<p>With Trump's return to the Oval Office just weeks away, some in India are already hoping that he will put New Delhi's new adversary, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, in his place. After all, Trump's past comments on Trudeau range from “weak” to “two-faced", to even “far-left lunatic”—hardly a subtle hint of his opinion of his neighbouring country's leader.</p>

<h2><strong>Why Canadians Are Worried</strong></h2>

<p>For Canadians, though, Trump's second term has sparked more shock than celebration. Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland (also the country's finance minister) held two press conferences post his election to calm Canadian nerves, saying Canada will be “absolutely fine”. Yet, many Canadians remain uneasy over Trump's return to the White House, and for good reason. There are three big areas of anxiety: tariffs, NATO contributions and the looming renegotiation of the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).</p>

<p>First, Trump has hinted at slapping a blanket 10% tariff on all imports to the US, which would hit Canada hard given that more than two-thirds of its exports are US-bound. Then there is Trump's expectation that NATO members chip in a full 2% of their GDP on defence. Canada is currently far behind and contributing only 1.23%—a potential sticking point if Trump insists on the required contributions like he did during the last term. Lastly, there's the USMCA, which Trump himself strong-armed Canada and Mexico into renegotiating in 2020. Trump has hinted that the deal is set for review in 2026. Canadians worry that the President-elect could push for even stricter terms this time around.</p>

<h2><strong>Will Trump Side With India?</strong></h2>

<p>Biden's team and its Western European pals are clearly frustrated with India's refusal to oppose Russia over the Ukraine war. They have not said it out loud, but it's hard not to suspect that they are quietly backing Trudeau behind the scenes in his finger-pointing at India, accusing officials of involvement in the killing of Sikh separatist Hardeep Singh Nijjar. Let's be real—it wasn't without Big Brother's nod that Trudeau stood in Parliament last year hurling accusations at India. Furthermore, if Canada decides to move forward with these allegations, the possibility is it won't be acting alone. The US and the UK, key members of the Five Eyes alliance, have often helped manage diplomatic and security issues with countries outside the alliance. Since both countries have close ties with India, they may help Canada weigh the strength and possible impact of these accusations before taking any official steps. Still, accusing a powerful country like India could affect important strategic interests.</p>

<p>Moreover, the possible egging on by Big Brother suits Trudeau too, giving him a shot at placating his Sikh voter base and propping up his waning popularity. However, only a rookie diplomat, I would say, can fully trust the self-serving strategy that the US usually follows.</p>

<p>We cannot underplay US State Department spokesman Matthew Miller's blunt statement last month: “When it comes to the Canadian matter, we have made clear that the allegations are extremely serious and they need to be taken seriously. We wanted to see the government of India cooperate with Canada in its investigation. Obviously, they have not chosen that path.” &nbsp;The statement did not reflect India's position that there was complete disregard for New Delhi's request to Ottawa to share evidence. And now, with allegations of India's involvement in an attempted assassination, the Biden administration has another card to play. Nonetheless, India is cooperating with the US on the investigation and neither side wants to blow it out of proportion.</p>

<p>Now, as Trump re-enters his office, his promise to end the war in Ukraine, if fulfilled, will be a game-changer. Without Ukraine in the equation, the US pressure on India to pick a side goes out of the window, and Biden's “cold-shoulder” tactics would become a non-issue. Trump, however, we all know, is a wildcard. While he may want closer ties with India, we know how that “America First” agenda translates: tariffs, immigration restrictions and a hard line on H-1B visas. Fortunately though, Trump's stance on Russia (to end the war) aligns with India's, as does his anti-China focus. It's quite possible he might ask Trudeau to either produce proof in the Nijjar case or drop the offensive. Who knows.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>But Don't Underestimate US-Canada Bond</strong></h2>

<p>Even so, we should never underestimate America's deep-rooted ties with Canada—they are in a league of their own. Sure, Trump and Trudeau have clashed publicly, but Trudeau is not one to be caught off guard. On Thursday, he revealed that his officials had been quietly talking to Trump's campaign team for months, readying for a potential return. Trudeau didn't waste a minute—he reinstated a Cabinet committee on US-Canada relations, led by Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland, to deal with anything Trump 2.0 might throw at them. And he was among the first to call Trump after the win, showing that when it comes to the US, Trudeau is all about pragmatism, or, dare I say, even subservience. His office spelt it out well: “Following the election of President Donald Trump for a second term, the Cabinet Committee will focus on critical Canada-US issues.”</p>

<p>The US-Canada relationship is unlike anything else in the world. The two countries are more like siblings rather than neighbours, no matter who sits in the Oval Office. They are two very prosperous countries: Canada's per capita income is over $58,000, while America's is $81,000. They have got each other's backs on defence, border security, and law enforcement. The overlap is everywhere—from culture and sports to leisure and shared traditions. They have much more in common between them than either of them has with India.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Consider this: in 2023, the US-Canada trade hit over a trillion dollars, with $2.8 billion crossing their border every single day. They are each other's biggest trade partners, with Canada sending 78% of its goods and services to the US every year, and over 400,000 people moving across their shared 5,525-mile border daily.</p>

<h2><strong>Canada Has Five Eyes By Its Side&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p>Let's keep in mind that Canada is a NATO member and the countries in the grouping are quite united and usually back each other against any third party. Then there is the intelligence-sharing bond under the Five Eyes institution. The Five Eyes alliance—a formidable network comprising the US, the UK, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand—has been at the forefront of global intelligence operations for decades. The alliance was built to facilitate intelligence collection and sharing among its members, ensuring a near-seamless flow of critical security information. In light of Canada's recent allegations against Indian officials, the alliance ought to have played a crucial role in sharing information with Canadian intelligence officials.</p>

<p>Also, as a core member of the Five Eyes, Canada has access to intelligence and insights that most nations can only aspire to attain. If Canada believes it has intelligence linking Indian officials to Nijjar's assassination, it is likely benefiting from the information-sharing protocols within the Five Eyes network. Notably, Canada may be leveraging Five Eyes capabilities to cross-reference signals intelligence (SIGINT) and other classified insights, allowing them to build a stronger case against India, should any concrete evidence exist.</p>

<h2><strong>Let Canada's Voters Decide</strong></h2>

<p>Anyway, India might just have to play the waiting game until Canada's next general election, now less than a year away. Trudeau's grip on power since he took office in 2015 is looking shakier than ever today. If he is out of the picture, the new government's stance on India could breathe fresh life into those frosty bilateral ties.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Baltasar Ebang Engonga, a high-ranking Equatorial Guinea official, has been fired after hundreds of videos showing him having sex with women went viral on social media.</p>

<p>In the videos, Engonga, who is married and is said to be in his 50s, is seen with different partners &nbsp;-- including the wives of prominent officials -- at his office in the finance ministry and other places.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to reports, around 400 of his sex tapes - which were filmed on unknown dates - have been leaked.</p>

<p>Authorities have warned the telecommunications ministry, regulator and telephone companies "to curb the distribution of pornographic videos that are flooding social networks".</p>

<p>#BaltasarEbangEngonga has been trending as one of the most discussed themes online.</p>

<h3><strong>Who Is Baltasar Ebang Engonga</strong></h3>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/equatorial-guinea-civil-servant-baltasar-ebang-engonga-under-scanner-over-hundreds-of-sex-tapes-6949028">Baltasar Ebang Engonga</a> is the director of the National Financial Investigation Agency (ANIF). He is nicknamed "Bello" because of his good looks.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Engonga is the son of Baltasar Engonga Edjo, the current Chairman of the Commission of the Central African Economic and Monetary Community. He is also related to the country's long-serving president.</p>

<p>Tasked to tackle crimes such as money laundering, he himself was arrested on October 25 for embezzling a huge sum of money from state coffers and depositing it in secret accounts in the Cayman Islands.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He was taken to the infamous Black Beach prison in the capital, Malabo.</p>

<p>His phones and computers were seized, and a few days later, his sex clips went viral online.</p>

<p>Chief prosecutor Anatolio Nzang Nguema has said that if medical exams revealed that Engonga was "infected with a sexually transmitted disease", he would be prosecuted for an offence against "public health".</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Internet users across Pakistan faced disruptions in accessing virtual private networks (VPNs) over the weekend, impacting both fixed broadband and mobile data connections, Dawn reported.</p>

<p>The report stated citing industry sources, that an "issue with the system" temporarily affected VPN connectivity. However, the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) has yet to comment on the matter, with its spokesperson not responding to inquiries on Sunday.</p>

<p>Since the government banned the social media platform X in February, VPN use has grown among users who rely on it to bypass local restrictions. Earlier this year, prolonged internet disruptions also led many to use proxy networks.</p>

<p>Over the weekend, unconfirmed social media reports suggested that the PTA might have banned certain VPNs; however, authorities attributed the disruption to a "brief" glitch in the system rather than any official restriction.</p>

<p>"We have been told by officials that access to VPNs was briefly disrupted for 30 minutes to an hour due to a glitch in the system," an industry insider told Dawn, emphasising that the disruption was short-lived.</p>

<p>Downdetector, a platform that monitors internet disruptions, confirmed complaints from users of VPN Unlimited, with reports peaking at 6:15 pm, and Tunnelbear users logging issues as late as 7:29 pm, reported Dawn.</p>

<p>Enterprises with registered VPNs also experienced connectivity issues, according to two industry sources. PTA has previously asked businesses, including software houses, call centres, freelancers, and foreign missions, to register their VPNs and IP addresses with the authority to maintain "uninterrupted" service during any network disruption.</p>

<p>In a statement issued in September amid complaints of slow internet speeds, PTA emphasised its commitment to supporting the tech industry, noting that "IP addresses for VPNs are being registered for software houses, business and IT companies."</p>

<p>Since 2020, more than 20,000 VPNs and IP addresses have reportedly been registered, according to Dawn.</p>

<p>Digital rights advocate Farieha Aziz criticised the lack of transparency surrounding the interruptions, stating, "It's completely arbitrary, disrupting everyday life and work and no one in the PTA and government has yet given a straight answer."</p>

<p>Another activist, Usama Khilji, expressed concerns that such disruptions align with "the state's plans to clamp down on VPNs" and warned that these actions could adversely affect sectors reliant on VPNs, particularly in finance and tech.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

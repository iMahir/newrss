       <description><![CDATA[Predictions of the world's end have been made for centuries, from floods to fires to comets. But none have come true.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Remember the hysteria surrounding December 21, 2012? The world was supposedly ending, and many believed it. This belief was based on a misinterpretation of the Mayan calendar, which some thought hinted at an impending global catastrophe on the said date. However, December 21, 2012, arrived, and nothing happened. The world continued to spin and life went on as usual.</p>

<p>Predictions of the world's end have been made for centuries, from floods to fires to comets. But none have come true.</p>

<p>Here is a list of some of the major failed doomsday predictions:</p>

<h3><strong>Maya Apocalypse</strong></h3>

<p>On December 21, 2012, the Maya Long Count calendar completed its first cycle. Despite the calendar's continuous time tracking, many misinterpreted this event as a harbinger of doom. Fanciful predictions emerged, including a collision with a fictional planet, solar flares, and axis realignment. Some even built arks and sold survival kits. But the predicted apocalypse never came.</p>

<h3><strong>Harold Camping</strong></h3>

<p>Harold Camping has made a dozen apocalyptic predictions based on his biblical numerology interpretations. In 1992, he wrote "1994?", forecasting the world's end around that year. His most significant prediction was May 21, 2011, calculated as 7,000 years after the Biblical flood. When nothing happened, he recalculated and pushed the doomsday date to October 21, 2011, when, again, nothing happened.</p>

<h3><strong>True Way</strong></h3>

<p>Leader of the True Way movement, Hon-Ming Chen predicted God would appear on TV in 1988, followed by his physical manifestation. In 1989, he foretold massive flooding, devil spirits and even human extinction and said his followers could escape by buying spots on "cloud" spaceships. His bizarre prophecies ultimately proved false.</p>

<h3><strong>Halley's Comet</strong></h3>

<p>In 1910, as Halley's Comet approached Earth, fears of destruction and poisonous gases spread globally. Media headlines like "Comet May Kill All Earth Life, Says Scientist" fueled the panic. Some believed the comet's tail would wipe out all humanity. A group in Oklahoma attempted to sacrifice a virgin to appease the comet, while others stockpiled bottled air. Ultimately, the Earth passed through the comet's tail with no apparent effects.</p>

<h3><strong>Millerism</strong></h3>

<p>William Miller's apocalyptic preaching attracted many followers who believed Jesus would come for the second time in 1843. When the prediction failed, William Miller recalculated, setting a new date for 1844. His devoted followers anxiously waited, only to face crushing disappointment.</p>

<h3><strong>Joanna Southcott</strong></h3>

<p>Joanna Southcott began hearing voices at 42, predicting future events like crop failures and famines. In 1813, she proclaimed she would give birth to the second messiah at 65, despite being a virgin. Her followers eagerly awaited the arrival, however, Joanna Southcott died before the predicted birth could happen.</p>

<h3><strong>Prophet Hen</strong></h3>

<p>In 1806, a hen in Leeds, England, seemed to lay eggs with "Christ is coming" written on them. People flocked to see the hen, fearing Judgment Day. But it was a trick - the owner had been writing on the eggs with ink and reinserting them into the hen's body.</p>

<h3><strong>Great Fire Of London</strong></h3>

<p>In 1666, many Europeans feared the end of the world, linking the year to the "number of the Beast" (666). The Great Fire of London, which razed much of the city, seemed to confirm these fears. The blaze destroyed 87 churches and 13,000 houses, but surprisingly, only 10 people died.</p>

<h3><strong>Global Flood</strong></h3>

<p>In 1524, German mathematician and astrologer Johannes Stoffler predicted a global flood on February 25, saying the planets had aligned under Pisces. But despite light rain, the flood never came.</p>

<h3><strong>Montanism</strong></h3>

<p>In the 2nd century, Montanus' visions led to a Christian split. He predicted Jesus would return and convinced many to leave their homes and wait for Jesus in Phrygia (modern Turkey). They expected the heavenly Jerusalem to descend, but the deity failed to materialise. The movement caused disruption, with many Christian communities left almost deserted.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Activists have continued to agitate online against President William Ruto, despite his decision last week to withdraw a controversial bill that triggered what he has branded "treasonous" protests by Gen-Z Kenyans.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">

<p>The Kenya National Commission on Human Rights (KNCHR) on Monday said that 39 people had been killed and 361 injured during two weeks of protests -- with the worst violence occurring in Nairobi last Tuesday -- and condemned the use of force against demonstrators as "excessive and disproportionate".</p>

<p>It is the most serious crisis to confront Ruto since he took office in September 2022 in a nation often considered a beacon of stability in a turbulent region.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After last week's bloody chaos, young Kenyans, whose protest movement has no official leaders, called for a new day of peaceful action on Tuesday, with leaflets posted online using the hashtag "RutoMustGo".</p>

<p>But Nairobi's central business district -- the focus of previous rallies -- saw sporadic confrontations on Tuesday afternoon. Police fired tear gas and used water cannon against groups of stone-throwing men, some of whom lit bonfires on deserted roads.</p>

<p>"Goons have infiltrated," prominent Gen-Z protester Hanifa Adan posted on X.</p>

<p>AFP journalists reported seeing a number of arrests and injuries, although there are no official figures.</p>

<p>Several coffins, some covered with the national flag, were placed on roads by protesters, images on Kenyan television showed, before they were removed by officers.</p>

<p>Local politician John Kwenya told AFP that business owners shuttering their shops were "scared" of the "goons".</p>

<p>"This is economic sabotage," said Kwenya, a member of the Nairobi city county assembly.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in the country, local television broadcast images of larger marches in the coastal opposition stronghold of Mombasa, where a number of cars were torched, and Kenyan media shared video of at least one shop being vandalised.</p>

<p>Interior Minister Kithure Kindiki denounced what he described as an "orgy of violence", warning that the government would take action against anyone engaging in "anarchic chaos and cruel plunder".&nbsp;</p>

<p>"This reign of terror against the people of Kenya and the impunity of dangerous criminal gangs must end at whatever cost," he said.</p>

<p>On Tuesday last week, largely peaceful anti-tax rallies descended into deadly chaos when lawmakers passed the finance bill -- a deeply unpopular move among Kenyans already suffering from a cost of living crisis.</p>

<p>After the announcement of the vote, crowds ransacked the partly ablaze parliament complex in central Nairobi as police fired live bullets at protesters.</p>

<p>Although Ruto scrapped the legislation and appealed for dialogue with young Kenyans, his actions appear not to have appeased his critics.</p>

<p>In a television interview on Sunday he defended his decision to call in the military to tackle unrest and insisted he did not have "blood on my hands".&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the Rift Valley town of Nakuru on Tuesday, protesters marched peacefully, with some carrying pictures of three people killed in last week's demonstrations.</p>

<p>"We want justice for innocent Kenyans killed by police during the protests that were peaceful," Mary Lynn Wangui told AFP.</p>

<p>"Ruto has not offered an apology," said the 24-year-old, as she waved a placard declaring: "RutoMustGo".</p>

<p>At a peaceful march in the lakeside city of Kisumu in western Kenya, demonstrator Allan Odhiambo, 26, told AFP he had lost hope in Ruto.</p>

<p>"We promised a peaceful protest and that is what we have done, but Ruto must go," he said.</p>

<p>The state-funded KNCHR on Monday said that in the previous protests there had been 32 cases of "enforced or involuntary disappearances" and 627 arrests of protesters.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Kenya's cash-strapped government said previously that the tax increases were necessary to fill its coffers and service a huge public debt of some 10 trillion shillings ($78 billion), or about 70 percent of GDP.</p>

<p>In Sunday's interview, Ruto warned that the government would have to borrow another $7.7 billion because of the decision to drop the finance bill.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President Joe Biden's support for Israel during its nearly nine-month war in Gaza has spurred at least nine U.S. administration officials to quit, with some accusing the US president of turning a blind eye to Israeli atrocities in the Palestinian enclave.</p>

<p>The Biden administration denies this, pointing to its criticism of civilian casualties in Gaza and its efforts to boost humanitarian aid to the enclave, where health officials say nearly 38,000 have been killed in Israel's assault.</p>

<p>Israel launched its offensive in Gaza after Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, killing around 1,200 people and taking 250 hostages, according to Israeli figures.</p>

<h3><strong>Here are the US officials who have resigned:</strong></h3>

<p>Maryam Hassanein, who was a special assistant at the Department of Interior, quit her job on Tuesday. She slammed Biden's foreign policy, describing it as "genocide-enabling" and dehumanizing Arabs and Muslims.</p>

<p>Stacy Gilbert, who served in the State Department's Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration, left in late May. She said she resigned over an administration report to Congress that she said falsely stated Israel was not blocking humanitarian aid to Gaza.</p>

<p>Alexander Smith, a contractor for USAID, quit in late May, alleging censorship after the U.S. foreign aid agency canceled publication of his presentation on maternal and child mortality among Palestinians. The agency said it had not gone through proper review and approval.</p>

<p>In May, Lily Greenberg Call became the first Jewish political appointee to resign, having served as a special assistant to the chief of staff in the Interior Department. &nbsp;"As a Jew, I cannot endorse the Gaza catastrophe," she wrote in the Guardian.</p>

<p>Hala Rharrit, an Arabic language spokesperson for the State Department, departed her post in April in opposition to the United States' Gaza policy, she wrote on her LinkedIn page.</p>

<p>Annelle Sheline resigned from the State Department's human rights bureau in late March, writing in a CNN article that she was unable to serve a government that "enables such atrocities."</p>

<p>Tariq Habash, a Palestinian American, quit as special assistant in the Education Department's office of planning in January. He said the Biden administration was turning a "blind eye" to atrocities in Gaza.</p>

<p>Harrison Mann, a U.S. Army major and Defense Intelligence Agency official, resigned in November over Gaza policy and went public with his reasons in May.</p>

<p>Josh Paul, director of the State Department's bureau of political military affairs, left in October in the first publicly known resignation, citing what he described as Washington's "blind support" for Israel.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Wafaa Elwan's five-year-old son cannot sleep in the Gaza tent city where she and her seven children shelter, but it is not the guns of war that cause his daily nightmare.</p>

<p>"My son can't sleep through the night because he can't stop scratching his body," the anxious mother said.</p>

<p>The boy has white and red blotches over his feet and legs, and more under his T-shirt. He is one of many Gazans suffering from skin infections ranging from scabies to chicken pox, lice, impetigo and other debilitating rashes.</p>

<p>More than 150,000 people in the Palestinian territory have contracted skin diseases in the squalid conditions into which displaced Gazans have been forced since the Israel-Hamas war erupted on October 7, according to the World Health Organization.</p>

<p>"We sleep on the ground, on sand where worms come out underneath us," said Elwan. Her family is one of thousands living on a sandy patch near the sea close to the central Gaza city of Deir al-Balah.</p>

<p>Elwan believes infections are inevitable. "We cannot bathe our children as before. There are no hygiene and sanitary products for us to wash and clean the place. There's nothing."</p>

<p>Parents used to tell their children to wash in the Mediterranean. But pollution that has built up as war has devastated basic facilities has accentuated the risk of disease.</p>

<p>"The sea is all sewage. They even throw garbage and baby napkins into the sea," she said.</p>

<p>The WHO has reported 96,417 cases of scabies and lice since the start of the war in Gaza, 9,274 cases of chickenpox, 60,130 cases of skin rashes and 10,038 impetigo cases.</p>

<p>Scabies and chickenpox are particularly widespread in the coastal Palestinian territory, according to Sami Hamid, a pharmacist who runs a makeshift clinic in the Deir al-Balah camp.</p>

<h3><strong>Blisters and scabs&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Two boys in the clinic showed dozens of the distinctive chickenpox-induced blisters and scabs spread over their hands, feet, backs and stomachs.</p>

<p>Lacking medicines, Hamid, 43, himself displaced, rubbed a calamine lotion on the boys' skin to soothe the itching.</p>

<p>Children's skin suffers from "the hot weather and the lack of clean water", he said.</p>

<p>Mohammed Abu Mughaiseeb, the medical coordinator in Gaza for Doctors Without Borders (MSF), told AFP that children are vulnerable because "they are children -- they play outside, they'll touch anything, eat anything without washing it".</p>

<p>Abu Mughaiseeb said hot weather increases the sweat and accumulation of dirt that causes rashes and allergies, which if scratched lead to infections.</p>

<p>"People are not living in houses anymore, there is no proper hygiene," he said.</p>

<p>MSF doctors fear the appearance of other skin conditions such as leishmaniasis, which can be fatal in its most virulent form.</p>

<p>Gaza's children are already highly vulnerable to disease, he said, because their immune systems are compromised by malnutrition.</p>

<p>Hamid, the pharmacist, said his team visited a makeshift school recently, where 24 out of 150 students had scabies.</p>

<p>"Some of them have developed skin infections, and unfortunately these infections are spreading among them," Ola al-Qula, a teacher at one makeshift tent school, told AFP.</p>

<p>Other diseases have also rampaged through camps for the displaced, feeding on poor hygiene, the WHO warned.</p>

<p>"The toilets here are primitive, draining into channels among tents, which ultimately contributes to the spread of epidemics," said Hamid.</p>

<p>WHO said 485,000 cases of diarrhoea have been reported.</p>

<p>The United Nations said Tuesday there are now 1.9 million people displaced in Gaza out of a population of some 2.4 million.</p>

<p>The war began with Hamas's October 7 attack on southern Israel, which resulted in the deaths of 1,195 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 37,925 people, also mostly civilians, according to data from the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An Air Europa flight from Madrid to Montevideo made an emergency landing in Brazil after it was hit by severe turbulence that left passengers stuck inside overhead bins and dozens of others with head, neck and chest and chest injuries. The plane, a Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner with 325 people on board, was diverted in the early morning hours to the airport of Natal in northeast Brazil, where more than a dozen ambulances waited.</p>

<p>Videos from inside the plane have surfaced on social media which shows passengers helping a fellow flyer out of an overhead bin storage area. It remains unclear how the man came to be lodged in the space. Several passengers said that those not wearing seatbelts were thrown from their seats by the strong turbulence, hitting the ceiling.&nbsp;</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hurricane Beryl barreled toward Jamaica as a powerful Category 4 storm on Tuesday, threatening to dump rain on parts of Hispaniola after leaving at least three people dead on smaller islands in the eastern Caribbean.</p>

<p>Tropical storm conditions were expected on parts of the southern coasts of Haiti and the Dominican Republic on Tuesday evening, according to an advisory from the U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC).</p>

<p>"Beryl is expected to bring life-threatening winds and storm surge to Jamaica on Wednesday and the Cayman Islands Wednesday night and Thursday," the NHC said. A hurricane warning is in effect for both places.</p>

<p>In Haiti's capital Port-au-Prince, which is in the grips of entrenched gang violence and an ongoing humanitarian crisis, strong winds took residents by surprise on Tuesday afternoon.</p>

<p>The country's southwestern peninsula could get 4-8 inches (10-20 cm) of rain, with as much as 12 inches in some places, the NHC said. New Haitian Prime Minister Garry Conille warned residents to take precautions and stay alert.</p>

<p>The unusually early hurricane, whose rapid strengthening scientists said was likely fueled by human-caused climate change, is expected to still be a hurricane when it passes near Jamaica and the Cayman Islands later this week.</p>

<p>Beryl, the 2024 Atlantic season's first hurricane and the earliest storm on record to reach the highest category on the Saffir-Simpson Scale, felled power lines and unleashed flash floods across smaller islands.</p>

<p>The storm hit St. Vincent and the Grenadines especially hard, according to Prime Minister Ralph Gonsalves.</p>

<p>"The hurricane has come and gone, and it has left in its wake immense destruction," he said. On one island in the Grenadines archipelago, Union Island, 90% of homes had been "severely damaged or destroyed," he added.</p>

<p>The prime minister confirmed one death and said more fatalities could be confirmed in the coming days.</p>

<p>In a video briefing on Tuesday, Grenada's prime minister, Dickon Mitchell, stressed that Carriacou and Petite Martinique, two of the three islands that make up the country, bore the brunt of the natural disaster.</p>

<p>"The situation is grim. There is no power. There is almost complete destruction of homes and buildings," he said, citing impassable roads due to downed power lines and destroyed fuel stations crimping supplies.</p>

<p>Mitchell said at least two deaths were attributed to the impact of Beryl so far.</p>

<p>The hurricane, packing maximum sustained winds of 150 miles per hour (241 kph), is currently located about 360 miles (579 km) east-southeast of the Jamaican capital of Kingston, according to the NHC.</p>

<p>The Miami-based hurricane centre estimates that the massive weather system is moving toward the west-northwest at a speed of 22 mph (35 kph).</p>

<p>In Jamaica, men hauled fishing boats out of the water and tied them down in preparation for the hurricane's arrival, while others noted there was still time to prepare on Tuesday morning.</p>

<p>"We Jamaicans don't take things serious," said Standford Pusey, as he showed off items secured with plastic tarps.</p>

<p>In Fort-de-France on the French Caribbean island of Martinique, north of St. Vincent, a video shared on social media showed heavy flooding in the streets as locals attempted to clear away debris.</p>

<p>In addition to Haiti's southern coast, the NHC also posted a hurricane watch for Mexico's Yucatan peninsula, dotted with beach resorts popular with tourists.</p>

<p>Ahead of the storm's approach expected Thursday night, Mexico's defense ministry said the army, air force, and national guard had activated emergency response protocols in the three Yucatan states, with 120 shelters opened and nearly 4,900 troops on guard on the peninsula.</p>

<p>The unusually early timing and rapid intensification of the storm is partly due to warmer ocean temperatures, scientists say.</p>

<p>Climate change likely contributed to Beryl's early formation, while also driving how quickly it intensified, according to scientists surveyed by Reuters, which could provide an unsettling preview of future storms.</p>

<p>Global warming has helped push temperatures in the North Atlantic to record highs, said Christopher Rozoff, an atmospheric scientist at the U.S.-based National Center for Atmospheric Research. The warmer waters lead to more evaporation, which fuels more intense hurricanes featuring higher wind speeds, he said.</p>

<p>Beryl jumped from a Category 1 to a Category 4 storm in under 10 hours, according to Andra Garner, a Rowan University meteorologist. That marked the fastest intensification ever recorded before September, the peak of the Atlantic hurricane season, she added.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[By invoking the Supreme Court ruling on presidential immunity, former US President Donald Trump has won a timely reprieve by getting the court to agree to delay his sentencing till after the Republican Party Convention.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By invoking the Supreme Court ruling on presidential immunity, former US President Donald Trump has won a timely reprieve by getting the court to agree to delay his sentencing till after the Republican Party Convention where he is set to be crowned the party's presidential candidate.</p>

<p>Without an objection from the prosecutors, Judge Juan Merchan agreed on Tuesday to postpone the sentencing to consider claims by Trump's lawyers that the top judiciary's ruling applied his conviction last month on 34 charges of falsifying his business records to cover up payments to a porn star.</p>

<p>The sentencing now postponed to September 18 was set for July 11 -- four days before the Republican Party Convention scheduled to be held from July 15 to 18.</p>

<p>Trump faced a maximum sentence of four years for each offence and if he were sentenced as scheduled on July 11, he would have faced in the worst-case scenario the prospect of being in prison during the party convention in Milwaukee in Wisconsin state.</p>

<p>The date now set by the court would also be after the next presidential debate between Trump and President Joe Biden on September 10.</p>

<p>Trump welcomed the delay, posting on the media site 'Truth Social', "The impact of the immunity ruling is a loud and clear signal for justice in the US."</p>

<p>The Supreme Court ruling on Monday that could also affect his other cases came while Biden is facing a crisis because of his bewildering performance last week during a televised debate with Trump when he seemed at times to mumble incoherently and sport a vacant stare.</p>

<p>This has led to questions about his capabilities and calls by even his party members -- and media that is supportive of him -- to withdraw as the Democratic Party candidate and allow someone else more able to take on Trump in the November election.</p>

<p>Trump's lawyers cited the Supreme Court ruling that a President cannot be prosecuted for official actions to demand that his conviction to be tossed out.</p>

<p>The arguments are on flimsy ground, though, because the Supreme Court said that a President can be prosecuted for personal actions as distinct from official actions, and the hush money case involves Trump's personal actions before he became President.</p>

<p>However, their filing against the conviction would still have to get a response from the prosecution and be considered by the judge, buying Trump time.</p>

<p>The local prosecutor who brought the case, Alvin Bragg, wrote to the judge that "although we believe defendant's arguments to be without merit, we do not oppose his request for leave to file and his putative request to adjourn sentencing pending determination of his motion".</p>

<p>Trump's lawyer's arguments hinge on some evidence produced by the prosecutors like cheques he signed and social media posts he made while President that they claim came under the ambit of official actions.</p>

<p>Merchan had already dismissed the claim about social media posts because they were out there for millions of people to see.</p>

<p>Paying hush money to buy the silence of someone to avoid a scandal is not a crime, but falsifying business records is and the prosecution said that he had falsely shown the hush money as payments for legal services leading to his conviction.</p>

<p>Porn star Stormy Daniels had alleged that Trump had a sexual tryst with her in 2006 when his wife was pregnant.</p>

<p>As the 2016 election campaign got underway, Trump paid for her silence $130,000 through his then-lawyer Michael Cohen, who turned against Trump after his conviction in a different case and became a prosecution witness.</p>

<p>The cheques made in installments to Cohen and shown on the account books as lawyer's fees continued while Trump was in the White House.</p>

<p>Merchan has the option to give Trump probation -- virtually a warning that could lead to a prison term if he violates the conditions set by the judge -- and/or a fine but sparing him prison time as Trump would be considered a first-time offender.</p>

<p>Unlike the New York case, the Supreme Court ruling could have a more direct bearing on the secret documents case in a Florida federal court and election interference cases in a Georgia state court and a Washington federal court as they pertain to actions he took while President.</p>

<p>These cases could now be delayed till after the November elections while lawyers thrash out the implications of the Supreme Court ruling.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court's judgment reflected the nation's political divide with six Conservative -- three appointed by Trump -- coming out for the President's immunity and a minority of three liberal judges appointed by Democratic Presidents -- one by Biden -- opposing it.</p>

<p>In Florida, he is accused of illegally keeping classified documents with him after leaving office.</p>

<p>The Washington and Georgia cases revolve around his attempts to stay in power after losing the 2020 election to Biden.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court ruled on Trump's appeal against the Washington case, but it has broader implications for Trump's other cases as well as any to be brought against other Presidents.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden today blamed jet lag from his recent travels overseas for his disastrous debate performance against Republican rival Donald Trump.</p>

<p>"It's not an excuse, but an explanation," he said while addressing a fundraiser.</p>

<p>Biden said he "wasn't very smart" for "traveling around the world a couple times... shortly before the debate."</p>

<p>"I didn't listen to my staff," he said. "And then I almost fell asleep on stage."</p>

<p>Biden had flown to France, back to the United States, to Italy, among other travels, over a 14-day period before taking just a few days to rest at his vacation home in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware.&nbsp;He was dragging, according to several people who observed him during this period.</p>

<p>Joe Biden, who has always been gaffe-prone, appeared to struggle while responding to former US President Donald Trump's charges during the debate.</p>

<p>A bombastic Trump lashed out at his successor, calling him a failure on the economy and the world stage. Biden looked to hit back, but his delivery was hesitant as he spoke rapidly in a soft, trailing-off voice and stumbled on his words several times.</p>

<p>It was the first debate ever between a president and former president -- and each accused each other of being history's worst.</p>

<p>The 81-year-old's fumbling, halting performance has sparked calls from Democrats for him to end his quest for a second term and for "soul-searching".</p>

<p>Biden's remarks could invite even more scrutiny over whether the 81-year-old is fit for rigorous traveling, packed schedule.</p>

<p>White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre today admitted the debate was "a bad night" but added that Biden "knows how to come back" from adversity.</p>

<p>Responding to the criticism, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said people around the world were looking at what Biden has done since coming into office, not just one night, and that they appreciate his policies.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The UK Labour Party is 99 per cent "certain" to secure more seats in Thursday's general election than when it won a landslide victory in 1997, a major new poll said on Tuesday.</p>

<p>The centre-left opposition party -- out of power since 2010 -- is predicted to claim 484 out of a total of 650 seats in what would be an unprecedented victory in modern British history, pollster Survation said.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the right-wing ruling Conservatives and the centrist Liberal Democrats (Lib Dems) are in a close race to come a distant second and form the country's official opposition, it added.</p>

<p>The prediction is the latest in a series of so-called MRP polls -- which use large national samples to forecast results for every UK constituency -- that estimate Labour will win emphatically on July 4.</p>

<p>Such a scenario would see its leader Keir Starmer replace the Conservatives' Rishi Sunak as prime minister.</p>

<p>Labour has led the Tories in the polls by double-digit margins for nearly two years, and the gap has failed to narrow during a six-week election campaign widely seen as having gone badly for Sunak.</p>

<p>Survation said its data indicated that Labour would win around 42 per cent of the overall vote, ahead of the Conservatives on 23 per cent.</p>

<p>However, due to the UK's winner-takes-all electoral system in each of its 650 constituencies, that would see the Conservatives capture just 64 seats, with the Lib Dems predicted to claim 61.</p>

<p>Labour's estimated 484 seats would exceed the 418 won by ex-prime minister Tony Blair in 1997, and even top the Tories' landslide haul of 470 in 1931.</p>

<p>The pollster also predicted that Labour would again become the largest party in Scotland, winning 38 of its 57 seats and supplanting the Scottish National Party (SNP), which it estimated would secure just 10 seats.</p>

<p>The pro-independence SNP won 48 Scottish constituencies at the last election in 2019.</p>

<p>The Conservatives are "virtually certain" to win a lower share of the vote than at any past general election, according to Survation.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, it forecasted that Reform UK, the anti-immigration party founded by Brexit figurehead Nigel Farage, would only win a handful of seats despite taking the third-largest overall share of the vote, again due to the electoral system.</p>

<p>The Survation prediction, based on nearly 35,000 electorate interviews, is likely to intensify warnings by Sunak in the final hours of the campaign that voters should be weary of voting Labour and handing it a so-called "super-majority".</p>

<p>Starmer has accused his Conservative rivals of running "an increasingly desperate, negative campaign".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Google, despite its goal of achieving net-zero emissions, is pumping out more greenhouse gas than before as it powers data centers needed to support artificial intelligence, the company said.</p>

<p>Google's climate-changing emissions have increased 48 per cent in the past five years, at odds with a touted goal of becoming carbon neutral for the sake of the planet, according to an annual environmental report released on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Total greenhouse gas emissions in 2023 were 13 per cent higher than they were the prior year, primarily driven by increased data center energy consumption and its supply chain, the report stated.</p>

<p>The increase came even though Google has been ramping up the use of solar and wind-generated clean energy.</p>

<p>"In spite of the progress we're making, we face significant challenges that we're actively working through," chief sustainability officer Kate Brandt and senior vice president Benedict Gomes said in the report.</p>

<p>"As we further integrate AI into our products, reducing emissions may be challenging due to increasing energy demands from the greater intensity of AI compute, and the emissions associated with the expected increases in our technical infrastructure investment."</p>

<p>Google is not alone in facing the challenge of feeding power-hungry AI data centers, while trying to curb the creation of climate-changing greenhouse gas.</p>

<p>Microsoft said in its recent sustainability report that its greenhouse gas emissions last year were up 29 per cent from 2020 as it continues "to invest in the infrastructure needed to advance new technologies."</p>

<p>Microsoft and Google have been front runners in an AI race since OpenAI released ChatGPT in late 2022.</p>

<p>AI has been a theme for the rivals in blockbuster earnings performances quarter after quarter.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Google and Microsoft have each pledged to be carbon neutral by the end of this decade.</p>

<p>Microsoft has an added goal of being carbon-negative, taking climate-harming gas out of the air, by 2050.</p>

<p>Amazon, also an AI contender with its AWS cloud computing division, has said it is aiming to be carbon neutral by 2040.</p>

<p>"A sustainable future requires systems-level change, strong government policies, and new technologies," Google said in its report.</p>

<p>"We're committed to collaboration and playing our part, every step of the way."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US Supreme Court on Tuesday agreed to hear a challenge to a law in Republican-led Texas that requires pornographic websites to verify the age of visitors in order to limit minors' access to online sexual content.</p>

<p>Passed last summer, the law mandating adult websites to require state-issued identification from users was challenged in court by a trade association representing the adult entertainment industry that argued it violates First Amendment free speech rights.</p>

<p>A federal court sided with the trade association, called the Free Speech Coalition, and blocked the law, saying it was too restrictive.</p>

<p>But in March a conservative appeals court agreed with Texas authorities and upheld the age verification requirement, prompting the trade group to appeal to the Supreme Court.</p>

<p>In its legal brief to the high court, the group cited the risk of "disclosures, leaks and hacks" and argued that "by verifying information through government identification, the law will allow the government to peer into the most intimate and personal aspects of people's lives."</p>

<p>In his brief to the Supreme Court, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton argued "there is nothing unconstitutional" about the law.</p>

<p>"This statute does not prohibit the performance, production, or even sale of pornography but, more modestly, simply requires the pornography industry... to take commercially reasonable steps to ensure that those who access the material are adults," Paxton wrote.</p>

<p>Texas authorities have been raising alarm over minors' access to adult content, calling it a public health crisis.</p>

<p>Similar age verification laws have been passed in other states including Arkansas, Indiana, Kansas and others.</p>

<p>Oral arguments in the case will take place during the Supreme Court term which begins on October 7.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Laughing and joking, Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un cruised around Pyongyang last week in a Russian-made Aurus limousine to showcase their strengthened anti-Western alliance.</p>

<p>The luxury sedan was intended to epitomize Russia's domestic prowess and reduced dependence on imported technology and goods when unveiled in 2018.</p>

<p>But customs records show that the company that builds it uses millions of dollars in imported parts, many arriving in Russia from what Kim has described as his country's "primary foe", South Korea.</p>

<p>The imports point to Russia's ongoing reliance on Western technology as it seeks to navigate Western attempts to cut it off from global supply chains as punishment for its invasion of Ukraine.</p>

<p>The two leaders took turns driving the armoured limousine during Putin's pomp-filled visit, his first in nearly a quarter of a century to North Korea, in a demonstration of the two nuclear powers' increasingly close ties.</p>

<p>Russia imported equipment and components worth at least $34 million between 2018 and 2023 for assembling Aurus cars and motorcycles, customs records seen by Reuters showed. Reuters does not have access to more recent data.</p>

<p>The imports included car body parts, sensors, programmable controllers, switches, welding equipment and other components worth almost $15.5 million imported from South Korea. Parts were also imported from China, India, Turkey, Italy and other EU countries.</p>

<p>Foreign supplies for Aurus kept coming after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, with goods worth almost $16 million, including $5 million produced in South Korea, imported since February 2022, the records showed.</p>

<p>Reuters could not determine specifically which imported foreign parts ended up in the car gifted to Kim, and the imports were not in breach of sanctions - Aurus LLC was sanctioned by the United States in February, 2024.</p>

<p>The Aurus sedan was developed by Russian state-owned research institute NAMI in partnership with Russian carmaker Sollers, which has since sold its stake.</p>

<p>Aurus Motors and its CEO Andrey Pankov did not respond to Reuters' requests for comment on the use of foreign parts, including from South Korea, in its vehicles.</p>

<p><strong>GROWING PRODUCTION</strong></p>

<p>The company launched official production in Russia's Tatarstan region, around 1,000 km (620 miles) from Moscow, in 2021 - before then it was made on a small, experimental scale at NAMI. It will start additional production in St Petersburg later this year at Toyota's former factory.</p>

<p>Toyota is one of many foreign carmakers to exit the Russian market since the invasion, which Russia calls a "special military operation".</p>

<p>The exodus has left a gap that Chinese producers have been quick to fill, rapidly seizing more than half the market share and exposing Russia's limited domestic production capacity.</p>

<p>South Korean firms were among the largest suppliers to Aurus, including industrial equipment producer Kyungki Industrial Co, car body parts manufacturer BYT CO LTD and batteries supplier Enertech International Inc.</p>

<p>Italian plastic parts producer Industrie Ilpea Spa and Hong Kong company Rain Electronics also supplied goods.</p>

<p>Kyungki Industrial Co said in a statement to Reuters on Monday that it had not signed any contract with Aurus or Russian suppliers since 2021 or participated in any further projects in Russia since 2022. It also said that it would be concerned about any potential sanctions.</p>

<p>A company representative had earlier told Reuters the company continued to supply Aurus and was not concerned about potential sanctions. The representative later referred Reuters to Monday's statement.</p>

<p>Rain Electronics could not be reached for comment. When a Reuters correspondent visited the address listed on the internet as the company's office in Hong Kong, there was no trace of Rain Electronics on the floor listed online or in the office building.</p>

<p>BYT CO LTD, Enertech International and Industrie Ilpea Spa did not respond to Reuters' requests for comment.</p>

<p>The Aurus Senat, retro-styled after the Soviet-era ZIL limousine, is Russia's official presidential car and was used by Putin at his presidential inaugurations in 2018 and 2024.</p>

<p>Putin has now given Kim, believed to be a keen automobile fan, two Aurus cars, first during Kim's visit to Russia in February, and a slightly different model in North Korea in June.</p>

<p>Prices for Aurus cars - there are four models including an SUV and armoured version - start from 46.625 million roubles ($528,356). Customers include Turkmenistan President Serdar Berdymukhamedov.</p>

<p>Aurus sold 107 cars in Russia in 2023, according to data from Russian analytical agency Autostat. Aurus does not disclose production numbers.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;Chinese officials boarded and then seized a Taiwanese fishing boat operating near China's coast close to a Taiwan-controlled island and took it to a Chinese port, the Taiwan coast guard said late on Tuesday in a further escalation of tensions.</p>

<p>China views democratically governed Taiwan as its own territory and has ramped up pressure on Taipei since President Lai Ching-te took office in May, a man Beijing accuses of being a "separatist".</p>

<p>The fishing boat was operating near the Taiwan-administered Kinmen islands, which sit next to the Chinese cities of Xiamen and Quanzhou, on Tuesday night when it was boarded and seized by two Chinese maritime administration boats, Taiwan's coast guard said.</p>

<p>Taiwan sent it own coast guard ships to assist and broadcast warnings asking China to release the fishing boat, but China's ships broadcast back saying not to interfere, Taiwan's coast guard said in a statement.</p>

<p>Taiwan's ships then backed off to avoid a conflict and the Taiwanese fishing vessel was then taken to a Chinese port, it added.</p>

<p>China's Taiwan Affairs Office did not answer calls seeking comment outside of office hours.</p>

<p>Chinese maritime enforcement and coast guard ships have been regularly operating around Kinmen since February after two Chinese fishermen died trying to flee Taiwan's coast guard.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel has killed about 900 militants in Rafah since the beginning of Israel's ground assault on the southernmost city in Gaza in early May, Israel's military Chief Herzi Halevi said.</p>

<p>The casualties include "at least one battalion commander, many company commanders, and many operatives," Halevi said on Tuesday when inspecting a military logistic post in the southern Gaza Strip, according to a statement released by the Israel Defense Forces.</p>

<p>He added that the offensive in Rafah is expected to be completed within weeks, Xinhua news agency reported.</p>

<p>"Now the effort focuses on the destruction of the infrastructure and the destruction of the underground infrastructure, and it takes time," he said, noting, "This campaign is long because we don't want to leave Rafah with the infrastructure intact."</p>

<p>Before the launch of the ground offensive, Rafah was one of the few locations where civilians sought refuge from the massive Israeli bombardments across the Palestinian enclave.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden on Tuesday blamed his recent foreign travels for his debate debacle.</p>

<p>"I wasn't very smart. I decided to travel around the world a couple of times … shortly before the debate," Biden said while talking to donors at a fundraiser in a Virginia suburb of Washington DC. "I didn't listen to my staff … and then I almost fell asleep on stage."</p>

<p>In his remarks, Biden admitted that he did not have a good debate, and said he "wasn't very smart" for "travelling around the world a couple times" before the debate.</p>

<p>Biden also apologised by saying he was sorry for the performance. "It's not an excuse but an explanation." The president's remarks at the fund raiser was just for six minutes, which is far shorter than what he speaks on such occasions.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the White House said Biden will travel to Wisconsin on Friday. He will conduct a sit-down interview with George Stephanopoulos from ABC News, while on the campaign trail.</p>

<p>He will travel to Philadelphia on Sunday. And next week, he will host a NATO press conference, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters at her daily news conference.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Democrats shocked by Joe Biden's dismal debate performance urged the US president Tuesday to be transparent about his mental fitness as he faced the first call from his own side to drop out of the election.</p>

<p>Some supporters have expressed growing doubts about the 81-year-old after last week's televised showdown with Donald Trump when Biden stumbled over his words and lost his train of thought -- exacerbating fears about his age.</p>

<p>Congressman Lloyd Doggett became the first Democratic lawmaker to publicly call on Biden to make way for another candidate, saying he was hopeful the president would "make the painful and difficult decision to withdraw."</p>

<p>Nancy Pelosi, a former House speaker and a grandee of the Democratic Party, said in her own statement it was "legitimate" to ask whether Biden's debate disaster was indicative of a deeper problem rather than a one-off.</p>

<p>Biden has not given a live interview or held a press conference since the debacle, meaning he has not had to give unscripted comments under pressure again.</p>

<p>ABC News announced that he would be interviewed by the network on Friday, with the first clips released that day.</p>

<p>White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on Tuesday admitted the debate was "a bad night" for the president but added that Biden "knows how to come back" from adversity.</p>

<p>"We understand. We're not taking away from what you all saw," she told reporters. "I think the president's work record certainly speaks for itself."</p>

<p>She dismissed questions about Biden needing a cognitive test, and said the president would speak to high-ranking Democrats, before holding a press conference during a NATO summit in Washington next week.</p>

<p>- 'Horrified' -</p>

<p>The polling margins between the president and his Republican predecessor have been razor-thin and almost static for months, with Trump showing a slight advantage in the all-important swing states.</p>

<p>Biden pushed for an unusually early first debate in hopes that he could jolt the race while there was still time to build on any momentum gained -- but the plan backfired.</p>

<p>Democratic Senator Sheldon Whitehouse told WPRI-TV he was "pretty horrified" by the president's performance during the 90-minute CNN match-up, watched by more than 50 million Americans.</p>

<p>Jared Golden, a vulnerable Democrat in conservative-leaning House district, raised eyebrows with an op-ed in his local paper in Maine in which he said Biden's poor showing "was not a surprise."</p>

<p>"It also didn't rattle me as it has others, because the outcome of this election has been clear to me for months: While I don't plan to vote for him, Donald Trump is going to win. And I'm OK with that," he said, explaining he believed US democracy would endure.</p>

<p>The White House has always shrugged off concern about Biden's mental acuity, sometimes with marked irritation.</p>

<p>His campaign -- under pressure over its tactics -- hit out at "self-important podcasters" in a memo widely seen as a swipe at a group of former Barack Obama staffers and slammed demands from "the bedwetting brigade" for Biden drop out.</p>

<p>But Vermont Senator Peter Welch, a Democrat, told news website Semafor on Tuesday that Biden's team had "a dismissive attitude towards people who are raising questions for discussion."</p>

<p><strong>- Slowed down -</strong></p>

<p>Biden has visibly slowed over the last year.</p>

<p>It has been several months since the president, who has fallen in public on several occasions, stopped using his plane's high gangway, preferring a shorter, more stable staircase.</p>

<p>He has also surrounded himself with aides for the short walk from the White House to his helicopter on the lawn, preventing cameras from focusing on his stiff gait.</p>

<p>Biden, who has always been gaffe-prone, has not given a long press conference since January 2022 and spends almost every weekend in one of his Delaware homes, with no official schedule.</p>

<p>When he recently visited France to commemorate the 1944 Allied landings, he went straight from the airport to his hotel, where he remained for an entire day, with no public appearances.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Vice President Kamala Harris, who is of Indian and African heritage, has a better chance of retaining the White House in the November presidential polls than her boss President Joe Biden has, according to a latest CNN poll.</p>

<p>The approval rating of Biden, 81, has plummeted after his dismal debate performance in Atlanta last week against his predecessor Donald Trump.</p>

<p>Since the debate, there has been increasing voices in the ruling Democratic party for Biden to step down and let someone else run the race for the crucial November 5 presidential elections.</p>

<p>According to the CNN poll conducted by SRS, Trump is ahead of Biden by six points.</p>

<p>The poll also finds Harris within striking distance of Trump in a hypothetical matchup: 47 per cent of registered voters support Trump, 45 per cent Harris, a result within the margin of error that suggests there is no clear leader under such a scenario.</p>

<p>"Harris' slightly stronger showing against Trump rests at least in part on broader support from women (50% of female voters back Harris over Trump vs. 44% for Biden against Trump) and independents (43% Harris vs. 34% Biden)," the polls said.</p>

<p>White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre refrained to give a direct comment on the polls.</p>

<p>"I'm constrained to speaking directly to your poll and I get it and I hear the question. I got to be mindful, that is something for the campaign as you started saying, what the campaign has laid out their argument of the case. That is something for them to take up and that is something for them to answer," she told reporters when asked about it.</p>

<p>"What I can speak to is the president's record. What I can speak to, what he's been able to accomplish and the things that he's been able to do and get done is actually in line with majority of Americans. And I think that's important too, to note. And again, I will say with age comes wisdom and experience and that's certainly something that the president brings," she said.</p>

<p>Former First Lady Michelle Obama leads Trump by a whopping 11 points in an Ipsos poll—50 per cent to 39 per cent — though her office told NBC News in March she would not be running for president this year.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>French President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday urged Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu to prevent a "conflagration" between Israel and Hezbollah militants in Lebanon, during a telephone call between the two leaders.</p>

<p>Macron "reiterated his serious concern over a deepening of tensions between Hezbollah and Israel... and underscored the absolute need to prevent a conflagration that would harm the interests of Lebanon as well as Israel," the French presidency said in a statement.</p>

<p>He also insisted on the "urgency for all parties to move rapidly toward a diplomatic solution" to end the conflict sparked by the October 7 attack on Israel by Hamas militants in Gaza.</p>

<p>"The two leaders discussed the diplomatic efforts underway towards this," the Elysee Palace said, ahead of a visit by the US envoy for the conflict, Amos Hochstein, to Paris on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Macron also called on Netanyahu to refrain from any "new operation" in Gaza near Rafah or Khan Yunis, "which would only aggravate the human toll and a humanitarian situation that is already catastrophic", the Elysee said.</p>

<p>The Israeli army on Monday ordered the evacuation of most areas east of Khan Yunis and Rafah along the Egyptian border.</p>

<p>It did not explicitly announce a military operation, but such orders have typically preceded major offensives.</p>

<p>The announcement sparked a mass exodus of Palestinians from parts of southern Gaza on Tuesday as Israeli forces launched deadly strikes and clashed with militants.</p>

<p>Hamas's October 7 attack on southern Israel that triggered the war resulted in the deaths of 1,195 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.</p>

<p>The militants also seized 251 hostages, 116 of whom remain in Gaza including 42 the army says are dead.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory offensive aimed at eradicating the Palestinian militants in Gaza has killed at least 37,925 people, also mostly civilians, according to data from the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yemen's Houthis said on Tuesday that they, along with the Islamic resistance in Iraq, have conducted a joint military operation, attacking a vital target in Israel's Haifa.</p>

<p>The military operation has been carried out with "a number of winged missiles," Houthi military spokesperson Yahya Saree said in a televised statement, without identifying the target that was attacked.</p>

<p>The Houthi group has been launching drone and missile strikes in shipping lanes since November, in what it says is in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza.</p>

<p>The Iran-aligned Houthis first launched drone and missile strikes in shipping lanes in November.

       <description><![CDATA[A judge postponed on Tuesday Donald Trump's sentencing following his conviction for covering up hush money payments until September 18 to allow time for a Supreme Court ruling on presidential immunity to be considered.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A judge postponed Tuesday Donald Trump's sentencing for covering up hush money payments until September 18, the first fallout of a Supreme Court ruling on presidential immunity, pushing it to after the Republican convention.</p>

<p>The United States' top court ruled Monday that Trump enjoys some immunity from prosecution as a former president, a decision also set to delay his trial for conspiring to overturn the 2020 election.</p>

<p>Hours after the ruling was announced, Trump's legal team said in a letter to the New York court that the immunity ruling vindicated Trump's position that he should not be judged for his "official acts," and reiterated his call for the conviction to be set aside.</p>

<p>The sentencing had been scheduled for July 11, days before the Republican National Convention on July 15 at which Trump is expected to be proclaimed the party's nominee for the battle against President Joe Biden for the White House.</p>

<p>"The matter is adjourned to September 18, 2024, at 10 am for the imposition of sentence, if such is still necessary," Judge Juan Merchan said in a court filing to allow time for consideration of the bombshell Supreme Court ruling.</p>

<p>Manhattan prosecutor Alvin Bragg had earlier said in a filing that he was not opposed to the delay, but that he believed the "defendant's arguments to be without merit."</p>

<p>The conviction in New York in May made Trump the first former US president ever convicted of a crime. He was found guilty on 34 counts of falsifying business records to cover up hush money payments over his alleged affair with an adult film star in the run-up to the 2016 election.</p>

<p><strong>- 'Loud and clear' -</strong></p>

<p>In a post on Truth Social, Trump wrote he "was Totally and Completely Innocent from the beginning of this Giant and Highly Illegal Scam, long before the Supreme Court's Decision."</p>

<p>"The impact of the Immunity Ruling is a loud and clear signal for Justice in the United States. I AM PROUD TO BE AN AMERICAN!" he added.</p>

<p>Biden warned Monday that the US Supreme Court's landmark ruling sets a "dangerous precedent" that Trump would exploit if elected in November.</p>

<p>Former FBI agent Yale University law professor Asha Rangappa told AFP that the conduct for which Trump was convicted appeared "far removed from his official duties."</p>

<p>But because the Supreme Court gave limited guidance in its ruling "it's hard to really know, what will count and what won't."</p>

<p>Facing four criminal cases, Trump has been doing everything in his power to delay the trials until after the election.</p>

<p>The conservative-dominated top court ruled that Trump -- and all presidents -- enjoy "absolute immunity" from criminal prosecution for "official acts" taken while in office, but can still face criminal penalties for "unofficial acts."</p>

<p>Conservative Chief Justice John Roberts, in his majority opinion, said a president is "not above the law" but does have "absolute immunity" from criminal prosecution for official acts taken while in office.</p>

<p>"The president therefore may not be prosecuted for exercising his core constitutional powers," Roberts said.</p>

<p>"As for a President's unofficial acts, there is no immunity," the chief justice added, sending the case back to a lower court to determine which of the charges facing Trump involve official or unofficial conduct.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

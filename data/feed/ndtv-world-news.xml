       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Global pop sensation Taylor Swift's support for Kamala Harris may have boosted the Democratic vice president's hopes of attracting young voters, but the question remains: Will the celebrity endorsement make a difference on Election Day?</p>

<p>Locked in a tight White House race, both Kamala Harris and her rival, Republican former President Donald Trump are doing all they can to lure voters on Election Day Nov. 5 and in early voting starting next week.</p>

<p>For his part, Trump dismissed Swift's Tuesday night endorsement of Harris, saying he was "not a Taylor fan."</p>

<p>With voter registrations down among young people in a country where 18 is the voting age, the first challenge for either campaign may be getting them to register to vote at all.</p>

<p>Young voters played a decisive role in Democratic President Joe Biden's victory over the then-incumbent Trump in 2020. Biden captured about 61% of the vote to Trump's 36% of voters between the ages of 18 and 29, according to data from Tufts University.</p>

<p>A July 2024 analysis by Tufts University's youth civic engagement group, CIRCLE, found that voter registrations have dropped significantly since then in 36 states among those aged 18-29. Harris launched her campaign on July 21 after Biden withdrew.</p>

<p>"Registering youths remains a major task in the months ahead," the analysis said.</p>

<p>Enter Swift, an artist so successful she tied hip-hop star Beyonce's record of 30 lifetime awards at the MTV Video Music Awards on Wednesday night. A 2023 Morning Consult poll found that 55% of self-described Swift fans were Democrats and 45% were millennials aged 28 to 43.</p>

<p>"I'm voting for @kamalaharris because she fights for the rights and causes I believe need a warrior to champion them," Swift wrote on Tuesday to her 284 million Instagram followers, urging them to register to vote and make their own choice.</p>

<p>Her post drew 10.4 million "likes." The vote.gov website received 405,999 visitors in the 24 hours after Swift shared a custom URL with followers, a U.S. government spokesperson said.</p>

<p>Harris aides say they would love for Swift to actively campaign, such as by appearing at a rally in her native Pennsylvania, a battleground state that could well decide the election.</p>

<p>But the campaign itself was not involved in Swift's decision to back Harris.</p>

<p>The vice president's aides said they learned of Swift's support only when the entertainer, 34, posted it on Instagram minutes after the vice president stepped off the debate stage in Philadelphia on Tuesday night.</p>

<h2><strong>A QUESTION OF INFLUENCE</strong></h2>

<p>What difference does a celebrity endorsement make?</p>

<p>A 2008 Northwestern University report found Oprah Winfrey's endorsement added a million votes to Barack Obama's tally.</p>

<p>But a 2010 North Carolina State University report found celebrity endorsements by George Clooney and Angelina Jolie did little to move the political needle.</p>

<p>Margaretha Bentley, a professor at Arizona State University whose class studies Swift's social importance, is unsure whether the pop singer will have an impact. She asked her students earlier this year whether a Swift endorsement would matter.</p>

<p>Some said they would follow Swift's lead and others said it would prompt them to do more research. "Some students told me they listen to celebrities when it comes to, like, what coffee they would drink, not politics," Bentley said.</p>

<p>A Swift fan at the VMA awards on Wednesday, Morgan Paris, said: "It's good that she said what she feels. And I mean, I feel like her politics and her music are two separate things, so you can't really combine them."</p>

<p>Ashley Spillane wrote in a study published last month by Harvard's Kennedy School that non-profits found "higher rates of online voter registration or poll worker sign-ups when a celebrity promotes these calls to action."</p>

<p>"While some polling shows that people claim they aren't influenced by celebrity voices when it comes to politics, more rigorous evidence indicates that these voices are incredibly powerful," Spillane said.</p>

<h3><strong>SWIFT ACTION ON BEHALF OF HARRIS</strong></h3>

<p>The Harris campaign and their supporters are building on the endorsement, announcing pre-orders for its latest campaign wear: Swift fan-inspired friendship bracelets.</p>

<p>The progressive group MoveOn.org is selling Swift T-shirts that play on Swift's ongoing Eras concert tour. The shirt, reading "In My Voting Era," is the fastest selling item the group has sold this year, spokesperson Britt Jacovich said.</p>

<p>Voters of Tomorrow, which seeks to boost the youth vote, is teaming up with the informal group "Swifties for Harris" on a phone bank on Saturday to target college students in Georgia and Wisconsin, both battleground states like Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>Swift "is one of the most influential people of our generation, and we're definitely excited to see how we can take her message and turn that into more political action and get more people involved," said Jessica Siles, a spokesperson for Voters of Tomorrow.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Earth's moon will soon have a temporary junior companion, an apparent mini moon revolving around our planet for about two months. In a rare event, an asteroid will be captured by Earth's gravity and will orbit the earth from September 29 to November 25 this year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The asteroid 2024 PT5 was spotted on August 7 using the Asteroid Terrestrial-Impact Last Alert System (ATLAS), a NASA-funded asteroid impact early warning system.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to a report published in the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2515-5172/ad781f">Research Notes of the American Astronomical Society</a>, the asteroid is not too big with a diameter of just 10 metre (33 feet). During its 53-day tenure around the earth, 2024 PT5 will not be able to make a full orbit, instead it will perform a horseshoe loop before breaking away from the earth's gravitational pull.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The RNAAS report, authored by Carlos de la Fuente Marcos and Raul de la Fuente Marcos, says that Earth has a tendency to capture asteroids and pull them into its orbit. These asteroids sometimes perform one or more full revolutions around our planet while other times, they break away from the earth's elliptical path before completing an orbit. &nbsp;</p>

<p>In 2006, an asteroid captured by Earth's gravity revolved around it for a year from July 2006 to July 2007. However, the newly discovered 2024 PT5 seems to resemble the path of 2022 NX1, a temporary flyby that revolved around Earth in 1981 and 2022 without ever completing an orbit and will likely return to take another semi round in 2051.</p>

<p>While Earth may sometimes pull space junk into its orbit, the report says that 2024 PT5 is a natural object as "its short-term dynamical evolution closely resembles that of 2022 NX1, a confirmed natural object." The report also indicates that its orbital properties resemble that of asteroids that come from the Arjuna asteroid belt.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US Vice President Kamala Harris will join celebrity Oprah Winfrey in a livestream event next week to rally support in key battleground states in the Nov. 5 presidential election, Harris' campaign said.</p>

<p>The "Unite for America" event will be in collaboration with Win With Black Women volunteer network, and will gather more than 140 grassroots groups to support Harris, the Democratic nominee, virtually on Thursday. Harris faces former President Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, in the election.</p>

<p>"What is essential to me is getting people motivated to vote - and that's my intention in hosting this event," Winfrey said in a statement. "My goal is to get people excited about the privilege and power of the vote."</p>

<p>Winfrey was the host of the long-running "The Oprah Winfrey Show," as well as a businesswoman and philanthropist.</p>

<p>The event, which will stream at 8 pm EDT (05:30 am IST) across online platforms including YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, TikTok and Twitch, will feature representatives from dozens of groups that have organized over Zoom since the Harris campaign launched in July, including Latinas for Harris, White Dudes for Harris, Win With Black Men and Republicans for Harris.</p>

<p>Winfrey spoke at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in August, to press the case for Harris.</p>

<p>"I'm calling on all you independents and all you undecided," Winfrey said then, describing herself as an independent voter. "Decency and respect are on the ballot in 2024."</p>

<p>Harris will also participate in an interview with the ABC News affiliate in Philadelphia that will air later on Friday, her campaign said.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[Athos Salome, the Brazilian parapsychologist known as the 'Living Nostradamus,' claims that his 2024 forecasts, including a looming asteroid threat, have come true.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Athos Salome, known as the 'Living Nostradamus,' has claimed that four of his forecasts have become reality in 2024, including a looming asteroid threat, according to <em>The Daily Star.</em> This 36-year-old Brazilian parapsychologist has been celebrated for accurate predictions regarding the Covid-19 pandemic, Elon Musk buying Twitter (now X), and the death of Queen Elizabeth II.</p>

<p>The latest warning by Salome coincides with the recent confirmation by NASA over the asteroid now dubbed 'God of Chaos.' According to the Near-Earth Object Observations Programme, the gigantic asteroid that Salome had predicted would be a concern in July is expected to come close to Earth this Sunday. As Salome's past predictions start to materialise, his reputation as a psychic grows, leading to a whole Pandora's box of questions about the validity and consequences of his predictions.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/webstories/feature/meet-athos-salome-living-nostradamus-and-social-media-sensation-15710"><strong>Also Read | Meet Athos Salome, 'Living Nostradamus' And Social Media Sensation&nbsp;</strong></a></p>

<p>Speaking to the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/living-nostradamus-made-seven-predictions-33643183"><em>Daily Star,</em></a> the Brazilian seer insists he isn't seeking praise or "unnecessary personal accolades," he just wants public validation of his realised visions.</p>

<p>Athos admitted: "I have noticed that, on several occasions, my predictions are appropriated by other individuals (not clairvoyants or paranormal experts) who present themselves as the originators of these ideas."</p>

<p>"On 28 July this year, I posted a video in my Instagram stories again about the asteroid, predicting that NASA would make an announcement in September, confirming that the asteroid would enter a collision course with Earth by November. My predictions are not coincidences. They are grounded and come true," he told the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/living-nostradamus-made-seven-predictions-33643183"><em>Daily Star.</em></a></p>

<p>Low and behold NASA has confirmed its Near-Earth Object Observations Program has been monitoring a huge asteroid dubbed 'God of Chaos'. It's expected to brush past us at a mere 620,000 miles away on Sunday.</p>

<p><strong>The beginning of World War 3</strong></p>

<p>Athos Salome has warned that World War 3 won't start in Ukraine or Gaza but will start in the disputed waters of the South China Sea through "some surprise event or a catastrophic cyber attack," as per the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/living-nostradamus-made-seven-predictions-33643183"><em>Daily Star report.</em></a></p>

<p>Talking about the natural disasters, Athos told the news portal: "In September of 2024 real events supported these expectations with typhoon Yagi, which affected and brought a large amount of damages to these parts of the world.</p>

<p>"The typhoon had winds in excess of 93 mph causing devastating floods and landslides with casualties and major destruction of structures. I said that more and worse cases of the event would occur, and going by the observed natural disasters this year, I was right.</p>

<p>"The increase of these events deepens the discussion on climate change and the poor readiness of countries for the consequences of climate change."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Boeing's first strike in 16 years could further compound global shortages of jetliners that have been pushing up airfares and forcing airlines to keep older jets flying longer, industry executives and analysts said.</p>

<p>The US planemaker's West Coast workers went on strike at midnight on Friday after overwhelmingly rejecting a contract deal, halting production of Boeing's workhorse 737 MAX.</p>

<p>It is Boeing's first strike since 2008, and Boeing Chief Financial Officer Brian West warned a prolonged walkout could hurt output and "jeopardize our recovery".</p>

<p>"Boeing is a systemically important company for global aviation," Ross O'Connor, chief financial officer of Irish leasing company Avolon, told Reuters on Friday.</p>

<p>A strike "could have an impact on production levels, which could exacerbate some of the supply shortages that are in the market at the moment for sure," he said after Avolon announced it had acquired a large portfolio of jets from Castlelake.</p>

<p>Airlines have struggled to expand capacity to meet rising demand as supplies of jetliners are curtailed by parts shortages, industry-wide recruitment problems and overloaded maintenance shops.</p>

<p>Analysts have been warning the most promising part of the industry's all-important business cycle could run out before airlines have a chance to enjoy the full benefits of demand.</p>

<p>"It's going to be a significant amount of time before we see that balance. I'm starting to evolve the hypothesis that it won't be (extra) supply that corrects it, but instead a softening of demand," said Rob Morris, global head of consultancy at Cirium Ascend.</p>

<p>Some say high air fares - although good for airlines in the short term - could themselves accelerate that tipping point.</p>

<p>"My view is that (average fares) will rise; and when ticket prices go up, then all other things being equal, you have lower traffic levels," said aviation economist Adam Pilarski, senior vice-president at AVITAS consultancy.</p>

<p>As Boeing halts production of its most-sold jet, European rival Airbus is also struggling to meet its goals.</p>

<p>Airbus Chief Executive Guillaume Faury expressed optimism at a U.S. Chamber of Commerce conference this week that the European planemaker would meet a recently lowered target of 770 deliveries this year, following a profit warning and engine supply glitch in the summer.</p>

<p>But following a short-lived spike in deliveries in July, industry sources questioned how comfortably the world's largest planemaker would exceed last year's 735.</p>

<p>Dwindling numbers of planes in storage and record-high utilization of existing planes confirm the supply squeeze.</p>

<p><strong>FLEET AGE RISING</strong></p>

<p>For now, Boeing's lower production levels compared to Airbus may limit the incremental effect of the strike. Yet analysts said airlines have little room to maneuver.</p>

<p>With leasing companies also running out of available capacity, carriers need to keep existing jets flying longer.</p>

<p>For most of the past 15 years, the average age of the fleet declined as airlines and leasing companies took advantage of low interest rates to invest in new fuel-saving jets.</p>

<p>In 2010, the average age of the widely flown single-aisle jet fleet was about 10.2 years, according to Cirium data.</p>

<p>After dipping to 9.1 years during the pandemic as airlines grounded fleets, the age started growing again. It now stands at 11.3 years "and still heading upwards," Morris said.</p>

<p>That is despite efforts to reach net zero emissions by 2050, which rely partly on modernizing the planes in service.</p>

<p>"It must mean that we're burning more CO2 than we should be because we're using more old aircraft...so one of the things that can go wrong is sustainability," Morris said.</p>

<p>The airline industry says it is confident of reaching a target of net zero emissions by 2050.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>British Prime Minister Keir Starmer is meeting US President Joe Biden for talks on the next steps in supporting Ukraine, centring on whether to allow Western missiles to be used to hit targets in Russia.</p>

<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has been pleading with allies for months to let Ukraine fire Western missiles including long-range US ATACMS and British Storm Shadows deep into Russia to limit Moscow's ability to launch attacks.</p>

<p>The New York Times reported, citing European officials, that the United States looks set to approve the use by Ukraine of long range missiles against targets in Russia on the condition that the weapons were not those provided by the United States.</p>

<p>President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday that the West would be directly fighting with Russia if it allowed Ukraine to strike Russian territory with Western-made long-range missiles, a move he said would alter the nature and scope of the conflict.</p>

<p>Focus now turns to talks in Washington after a joint fact-finding trip to Kyiv by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and British Foreign Secretary David Lammy earlier this week during which both allies offered new support for Ukraine, but no commitment on the missile use.</p>

<p>On Wednesday Lammy suggested discussions could continue beyond Friday, tempering expectations of a solid announcement from Starmer's Washington visit.</p>

<p>In remarks made on his way to Washington, reported by British media travelling with him, Starmer said:</p>

<p>"We will, of course, be talking about many things in the round, but this is not a sort of a series of individual decisions that we want to arrive at. It is making sure that all the decisions we made are within the strategic context."<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A woman has put up for sale three Taylor Swift concert tickets that she had purchased for her daughter's 13th birthday because of the popstar's recent endorsement of Democratic nominee Kamala Harris. In a viral video she posted on social media, the woman said she no longer supports Swift due to the singer's political stance and what she described as "non-Christian beliefs." She has put the tickets up for sale for the Toronto stop of Swift's Eras tour. The woman was very disappointed with Swift's political endorsement and her lifestyle.</p>

<p>Addressing Swift in the video, she said, "My tickets are now up for sale because I don't want to spend another dollar supporting you and your private planes and your non-Christian beliefs."</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">This concern mother has three tickets to the Taylor Swift concert in Toronto on November 15th. It was a special gift for her daughter who turns 13 that day. Her daughter has been a Taylor Swift fan forever, but because of Taylor's endorsement of Kamala, she now has those… <a href="https://t.co/frZxCUNm3Y">pic.twitter.com/frZxCUNm3Y</a></p>

<p>"One, I think it's really interesting how you had that one long letter for all your fans already printed out two seconds after Kamala and Donald Trump had their debate, which only tells me you already had this written up before the debate, which also tells me that you did not have an open mind. Kamala lied to everyone on that stage and those of us that know, know," she said.</p>

<p>The woman whose name has not been revealed criticised the singer for her alleged lack of concern for the economy.</p>

<p>"Taylor, you are a billionaire. The rest of us are not; the rest of us are struggling; people can't afford homes, and some of us are losing our businesses. If Harris gets into office, our economy is screwed, but I know that doesn't affect you because you have all that money and private planes. You just don't even live in that kind of world," she said.</p>

<p>She also voiced her support for former President Donald Trump, whom she called "the right guy for the job," and criticised Swift as being "out of touch" with the concerns of everyday Americans.</p>

<p>'Donald Trump is the right guy for the job. If the economy of the United States suffers, the whole world suffers, Taylor. If the whole world suffers, there goes your job and your career because nobody is going to be able to afford going to your concerts,' she added.</p>

<p>The woman had originally purchased the tickets to attend Swift's November 15th concert to celebrate her daughter, whom she described as a long-time fan of the singer. But Swift's endorsement of Harris following a recent debate changed her mind.</p>

<p>As such, Swift wrote on <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C_wtAOKOW1z/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==">Instagram in support of Harris:</a> "I will be casting my vote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz in the 2024 Presidential Election. I'm voting for @kamalaharris because she fights for the rights and causes I believe need a warrior to champion them."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russia launched a new overnight drone attack on Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities on Saturday, prompting President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to issue a fresh appeal for more air defence and long-range capabilities.</p>

<p>Ukrainian air defences shot down 72 out of 76 Shahed drones over 12 regions in the centre, south and east of the country, the air force said.</p>

<p>"We need more capabilities to strengthen the air shield, air defence, and long-range capabilities to continue protecting life and our people," Zelenskiy, who is due to travel to the United States later this month, said on the Telegram messaging app.</p>

<p>There were no immediate reports of casualties but authorities described damage to buildings in several parts of the country.</p>

<p>Kyiv city authorities said that drone fragments fell on a municipal building in the city's Obolon district north of the centre early on Saturday, but no fire broke out at the site.</p>

<p>The governor of the region surrounding Kyiv said drone debris damaged several private houses and a commercial property, and also smashed windows at a high-rise residential building.</p>

<p>In the southern Odesa region, debris damaged several commercial buildings and private houses and also caused several fires.</p>

<p>Air alerts sounded for three to five hours during the night in many regions across Ukraine. Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said air defence units had been in action in the capital during the night. Ukraine also deploys mobile groups of drone hunters and uses electronic warfare to repel frequent Russian drone strikes.</p>

<p>During nearly 31 months of the war, Moscow's forces bombarded Ukraine with thousands of drones and missiles, killing thousands of civilians, damaging the country's infrastructure and power sector and wrecking tens of thousands of residential and commercial buildings.</p>

<p>Moscow denies intentionally targeting civilians and says its long-range attacks aim to reduce Ukraine's ability to fight.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iran has launched a research satellite into orbit with a rocket built by the Revolutionary Guards, state media reported.</p>

<p>The launch comes as the United States and European countries accuse Iran of transferring ballistic missiles to Russia that would be likely used in its war with Ukraine within weeks. Iran has denied this.</p>

<p>The Chamran-1 satellite, which was launched into space by the Qaem-100 satellite carrier, was put into a 550-kilometre (340-mile) orbit and its first signals had been received, the media said, adding that the solid fuel carrier was designed and built by the Aerospace Force of the Revolutionary Guards.</p>

<p>The primary mission of the satellite, which weighs 60 kg (132 pounds), "is to test hardware and software systems for demonstrating orbital manoeuvring technology in height and phase," according to state media.</p>

<p>In January, Iranian media reported that the Sorayya satellite had been launched into a 750 km orbit, the highest by the country so far.</p>

<p>The US military alleges the long-range ballistic technology used to put satellites into orbit could also allow Tehran to launch long-range weapons, possibly including nuclear warheads.</p>

<p>Tehran denies its satellite activities are a cover for ballistic missile development and says it has never pursued the development of nuclear weapons.</p>

<p>Chamran-1's other mission was to "evaluate the cold gas propulsion subsystem in space systems and the performance of the navigation and attitude control subsystems", state media reported.</p>

<p>Iran, which has one of the biggest missile programmes in the West Asia (Middle East), has suffered several failed satellite launches in recent years due to technical issues.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese hit back at Elon Musk on Saturday after the tech mogul called his government "fascists" for proposing laws that would fine social media giants for spreading misinformation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Australia introduced a "combating misinformation" bill earlier this week, which includes sweeping powers to fine tech giants up to five per cent of their annual turnover for breaching online safety obligations.</p>

<p>"Fascists," Musk posted Thursday on his social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But Albanese fired back at Musk on Saturday, saying social media "has a social responsibility".&nbsp;</p>

<p>"If Mr Musk doesn't understand that, that says more about him than it does about my government," he told reporters Saturday.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The exchange between Musk and Australian officials is the latest in a long-running spat with the Australian government over social media regulation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Australia's government is exploring a raft of new measures that would see social media companies take greater accountability for the content on their platforms -- including a ban for those under 16 years old.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The country's online watchdog took Musk's company to court earlier this year, alleging it had failed to remove "extremely violent" videos that showed a Sydney preacher being stabbed.</p>

<p>But it abruptly dropped its attempt to force a global takedown order on X after Musk scored a legal victory in a preliminary hearing, a move he celebrated as a free speech triumph.</p>

<p>Musk, a self-described "free speech absolutist", has clashed with politicians and digital rights groups worldwide, including in the European Union, which could decide within months to take action against X with possible fines.</p>

<p>In Brazil, where X has effectively been suspended after it ignored a series of court directives, Musk has responded by blasting the judge as an "evil dictator cosplaying as a judge".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Social media is being flooded by digitally created "deepfake" videos using the trusted identities of famous doctors to promote dangerous miracle cures for serious health problems, experts warn.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Videos on Facebook and Instagram have taken advantage of the credibility of star TV doctors to advertise untested "natural" syrups for diabetes, even claiming that the proven, first-line drug metformin "could kill" patients.</p>

<p>These scams risk endangering lives, experts said, particularly because they deploy the likenesses of popular health experts such as British TV presenter Michael Mosley, who died earlier this year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"People do seem to trust these videos," British doctor John Cormack told AFP.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"A lot of these media doctors have spent a great deal of time creating an image of trustworthiness, so they are believed even when they make incredible claims," said Cormack, who has worked with the British Medical Journal (BMJ) on the subject.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) expert Henry Ajder said that doctor deepfakes "really took off this year". &nbsp;</p>

<p>The AI videos typically target older audiences by faking the identity of doctors who appear regularly on daytime television, Ajder said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>French doctor Michel Cymes, who often appears on TV in France, told AFP in May that he was taking legal action against Facebook owner Meta about "scams" using his image.&nbsp;</p>

<p>British doctor Hilary Jones even hired an investigator to track deepfakes that featured his likeness.</p>

<p>One video depicted Jones selling a false cure for high blood pressure -- as well as weed gummies -- on a UK TV show on which he regularly appears.</p>

<p>"Even if they're taken down, they just pop up the next day under a different name," Jones lamented in the BMJ.</p>

<h3><strong>'Game of cat and mouse'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Recent advances in AI have made the quality of deepfake images, audio and video far more convincing, explained French academic and AI expert Frederic Jurie.</p>

<p>"Today we have access to tens of billions of images, and we are able to build algorithms that can model everything that appears in the images and regenerate them. This is what we call generative AI," he said.</p>

<p>It is not just the likenesses of widely respected doctors being misused.</p>

<p>The appearance of controversial French researcher Didier Raoult -- who has been accused of spreading misleading information about COVID-19 drugs -- has also been used in several deepfake videos.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Australian naturopath Barbara O'Neill, who has been roundly condemned for claiming that baking soda can cure cancer, has been falsely depicted selling pills that "clean blood vessels" in TikTok videos.</p>

<p>Contacted by AFP, her husband Michael O'Neill deplored that "a lot of unethical people" were using his wife's name "to sell products that she does not recommend, and in some cases, they are just outright scams".</p>

<p>Some fake videos spiral even further down the rabbit hole, falsely claiming that O'Neill died from a miracle oil sold on Amazon.</p>

<p>AI expert Adjer was not surprised that such controversial health figures were also falling victim to deepfakes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"They are highly trusted by people in circles that, let's say, are unorthodox or conspiratorial," he said.</p>

<p>The experts were not optimistic that newly developed AI detection tools were capable of fighting back against the onslaught of deepfakes.</p>

<p>"It's a game of cat and mouse," Jurie said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Rather than trying to find all the fake videos out there, he pointed to technology that can "guarantee that content has not been altered, such as for messaging, thanks to software that produces digital signatures like a certificate", he said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>As India steps into its third term under Prime Minister Narendra Modi's administration, Southeast Asia has emerged as a central focus of its foreign policy. The region plays a crucial role in the Indo-Pacific theatre and has become pivotal to India's strategic, economic, and diplomatic interests.</p>

<p>Recent high-level engagements, such as Modi's visit to Singapore and Brunei in early September, External Affairs Minister Jaishankar's articulation of India's stance on the South China Sea, and the visits of Vietnamese and Malaysian Prime Ministers to India, signal a continuity in the strategic significance of Southeast Asia to India's foreign policy vision.</p>

<h2><strong>'Look East' To 'Act East'</strong></h2>

<p>The central government's "Act East Policy," an evolution from the previous "Look East Policy," signifies a more proactive engagement with Southeast Asian nations. Under Modi, this policy has become a cornerstone of India's Indo-Pacific strategy, which promotes a free, open, inclusive, and rules-based order.</p>

<p>The region's strategic importance is underscored by its geographical proximity to India and its role as a gateway to the South China Sea, a vital maritime corridor for global trade. Southeast Asia is a crucial part of the Indo-Pacific's geopolitical framework, and India's growing relationship with the region is seen as a counterbalance to China's expanding and often predatory influence. In Modi 3.0, India aims to solidify its position as a reliable partner in the Indo-Pacific region, with Southeast Asia being a crucial element of this strategy.</p>

<p>New Delhi has placed particular emphasis on fostering closer ties with ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) member states. Trade between India and ASEAN has grown steadily in recent years, with bilateral trade exceeding $100 billion in 2023. In addition to economic cooperation, India's strategic interests in the region have also deepened.</p>

<h2><strong>Singapore, Brunei, Vietnam</strong></h2>

<p>In Singapore, Modi's talks with newly elected Prime Minister Lawrence Wong resulted in substantive agreements, particularly in the semiconductor sector in addition to health, skilling, and digital security. The "India-Singapore Semiconductor Ecosystem Partnership" inked during the visit, aims to facilitate the entry of Singaporean companies into India. This partnership is integral to New Delhi's ambitions to become a global semiconductor hub, leveraging complementary strengths to build resilience in the global chip supply chain. Parallelly, Modi's visit to Brunei, a strategically located nation in the South China Sea, marked a key moment in India's Act East Policy and Indo-Pacific vision. It was the first visit by an Indian Prime Minister and coincided with the 40th anniversary of diplomatic relations between the two countries.</p>

<p>In Modi 3.0, Vietnam has emerged as one of India's most important Southeast Asian partners. The two countries share concerns over China's growing assertiveness in the South China Sea, where both India and Vietnam have vested interests in oil exploration and freedom of navigation. Discussions on defence cooperation, trade, and energy security marked the visit of Vietnamese Prime Minister Phạm Minh Chính to India. Vietnam is a linchpin in India's Act East Policy and Indo-Pacific strategy, strengthening their naval ties and defence collaboration. India and Vietnam have signed several agreements on defence, maritime security, and energy and economic cooperation. Both countries are committed to upholding international law in the South China Sea, further aligning their strategic interests. The bilateral relationship has also expanded into renewable energy, IT, and infrastructure development, with India playing a significant role in Vietnam's development plans.</p>

<h2><strong>Resetting Ties With Malaysia</strong></h2>

<p>Similarly, the visit of Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim to India highlighted a much-needed reset in bilateral ties following a dip in relations before 2022. Malaysia's importance to India stems from its strategic location along vital maritime routes in the Indo-Pacific and its role as a significant trading partner. During Anwar's visit, the two leaders discussed enhancing economic cooperation, particularly in technology, renewable energy, and digital connectivity. Malaysia's support for India's Act East Policy and its role in ASEAN make it a valuable partner for India as it seeks to expand its presence in Southeast Asia.</p>

<h2><strong>The South China Sea Question</strong></h2>

<p>Finally, India's position on the South China Sea has evolved significantly over the years, shifting from a cautious, neutral stance to one that has now clearly articulated its support for the Philippines' sovereign maritime territorial claims, freedom of navigation and maritime resource exploitation, in line with international law. This aligns India with Southeast Asian nations against unilateral actions by China, while also serving India's strategic interests by ensuring freedom of navigation and bolstering regional security. India's nuanced stance, informed by its own territorial tensions with China on its northern land border, underscores its intent to deter unilateral and unlawful advances.</p>

<p>Modi 3.0 marks a significant evolution in India's engagement with Southeast Asia, driven by geopolitical imperatives and economic interests. The Modi administration has steadily deepened the extent and scope of its ties with Southeast Asian countries, and his third consecutive tenure in office looks poised to build on the gains of the last ten years.&nbsp;</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump has defended his ties with Laura Loomer, who has drawn fire from some of his Republican allies for embracing conspiracy theories and making racist comments, including against Kamala Harris.</p>

<p>"Laura has been a supporter of mine. Just like a lot of people are supporters, and she's been a supporter of mine. She speaks very positively of the campaign," Trump, the former president, said on Friday at a news conference in Southern California.</p>

<p>He was responding to a question from a reporter about his allies expressing concern about his close relationship with Loomer in recent days.</p>

<p>"I don't control Laura. Laura - she's a free spirit. Well, I don't know. I mean, look, I can't tell Laura what to do," Trump said.</p>

<p>&nbsp;"She is a strong person, she's got strong opinions, and I don't know what she said, but that's not up to me," he added.</p>

<p>Several of Loomer's posts on social media this week came under fire, including one where she nodded to a conspiracy theory about the 9/11 attacks.</p>

<p>"23 years later, and there's still a lot of unanswered questions," Loomer posted on Friday, alongside a video of Trump in 2001 questioning whether aeroplanes could cause explosions like the ones that happened at the Twin Towers on 9/11," Loomer wrote.</p>

<p>Loomer, often seen as a right-wing conspiracy theorist, in another post on Sunday, said the "White House will smell like curry &amp; White House speeches will be facilitated via a call centre" if Harris wins the November 5 presidential election.</p>

<p>Harris, a Democrat, will take on Trump in the November election.</p>

<p>NBC News asked Trump whether he'd been informed of Loomer's conspiracy theories.</p>

<p>"I don't know that much about it. No, I don't," he said, adding, "I know she's a big fan of the campaign, but I really don't know." Trump later sought to distance himself from Loomer's statements, though without specifying which ones.</p>

<p>In a Truth Social post, Trump said that Loomer "doesn't work for the Campaign. She's a private citizen and longtime supporter. " Even in that post, Trump defended Loomer and said: "Like the many millions of people who support me, she is tired of watching the Radical Left Marxists and Fascists violently attack and smear me." Several Republicans denounced Loomer for her remarks.</p>

<p>Republican Senator Thom Tillis said Loomer was a "crazy conspiracy theorist who regularly utters disgusting garbage intended to divide Republicans".</p>

<p>"The history of statements by Ms. Loomer are beyond disturbing," Senator Lindsey Graham, also a Republican told The Washington Post on Thursday.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mohammed Sufiyan, a Telangana native who ended up working as a support staff for the Russian army after being duped by an employment agent, returned home on September 14. The return of Sufiyan (22), who belongs to the Narayanpet district, ends the agonising wait of his family members who were worried about his safety as he was helping the Russian military in its war with Ukraine.</p>

<p>Mr Sufiyan said he was promised a security-related job and not told about having to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/49-ukrainian-prisoners-of-war-return-from-russia-zelensky-6560097">help the troops in the war</a>. He was told that he would have to undergo training for three months after which his salary would increase.</p>

<p>Mr Sufiyan, who left India in November last year, has been working for the Russian military as a support staff.</p>

<p>Speaking to PTI in July this year, Sufiyan's brother Salman hoped for his brother's early return home following PM Narendra Modi's visit to Russia.</p>

<p>Russia had agreed to India's demand to ensure <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/45-indians-inducted-in-russian-army-discharged-efforts-to-rescue-50-more-6549672">early release of Indian nationals</a> working with the Russian military as support staff after PM Modi "very strongly" raised the issue with President Vladimir Putin during his visit.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

"After Wednesday's launch to the @Space_Station, there are now 19 humans in orbit—a new record for humanity. We're proud to help expand the boundaries of human exploration.

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p dir="ltr">Earlier this week, three people travelled aboard the Russian Soyuz capsule towards the International Space Station. Among these were NASA astronaut Don Pettit as well as Roscosmos cosmonauts Alexey Ovchinin and Ivan Vagner. With this, the orbit around the Earth now has a record-breaking 19 people.</p>

<p dir="ltr">This has surpassed the previous record of 17, set last year, <a href="https://www.space.com/new-record-19-people-orbiting-earth-soyuz-iss">Space.com</a> reported.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The earlier record in orbit was set in May 2023. Back then, there were a total of 17 people aboard both the International Space Station as well as China's Tiangong space station for a brief period of time.</p>

<p dir="ltr">With at least one person in the orbit at all times, the International Space Station has witness an enduring presence since 2000, <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/09/12/iss-astronaut-space-record/75193569007/">USA Today</a> reported.</p>

<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>The 19 people in space</strong></h3>

<p dir="ltr">Upon their arrival, Pettit, Ovchinin and Vagner have joined nine other astronauts and cosmonauts onboard the International Space Station. Among these are Sunita Williams, Barry Wilmore, Michael Barratt, Tracy Caldwell-Dyson, Matthew Dominick and Jeanette Epps of NASA and cosmonauts Nikolai Chub, Oleg Kononenko and Alexander Grebenkin.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The three people aboard the Tiangong space station are Li Guangsu, Li Cong and Ye Guangfu of the Shenzhou 18 mission.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Besides them, there are four astronauts, who are currently inhabiting a free-flying Crew Dragon. These include Jared Isaacman, Scott Poteet, Sarah Gillis and Anna Menon.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Launched on Tuesday, the Polaris Dawn mission is expected to last for five days.</p>

<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>Sunita Williams to return next year</strong></h3>

<p dir="ltr">Indian-origin astronaut Sunita Williams and Barry Wilmore were launched onboard Crew Flight Test (CFT), the first-ever crewed mission of the Starliner capsule of Boeing, in June this year.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Although the mission was supposed to last a few days, NASA decided to keep the Starliner docked to the ISS after the capsule suffered thruster problems in orbit.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Ultimately, the Starliner returned to the Earth uncrewed, while Williams and Wilmore are now expected to return home on a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule in February 2025.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Amid the tense situation in West Asia, Iranian Ambassador to India Iraj Elahi has said the tension between his country and Israel is "not new". He assured Indians and other tourists that "Iran is safe" to travel and urged them to explore the historic land of Persia.</p>

<p>In an interview with PTI on the sidelines of the Iran Tourism Roadshow in Delhi, the envoy also expressed the hope that more direct flights can be set up between the two countries, as well as by Indian carriers from between different cities of India and Iran.</p>

<p>Currently, there are two direct flights between Tehran and Delhi and one between the Iranian capital and Mumbai, he said on Friday.</p>

<p>Asked if the current tense situation in West Asia including the Iran-Israel hostility has cast a shadow on the flow of tourists in the country, Elahi said the situation has not changed, "but Indians and other tourists do not have any security problems" in Iran.</p>

<p>"The tension between Iran and Israel is not new, there have been tensions for a long time. So, it is not something new that will affect the situation in Iran... I assure Indian tourists, and Indian friends and invite them to come to Iran, and visit Iran.</p>

<p>"They should see by themselves how much safer Iran is. And, it is beautiful and attractive," Elahi told PTI Videos.</p>

<p>He emphasised that Iran has passed "imposed" wars and sanctions, in its journey as a nation.</p>

<p>Asked about the status of India-Iran ties in the face of changing global dynamics, the envoy said, "The bilateral ties with India are not only good but fantastic." India and authorities in India observed a day-long mourning when the then-Iranian president Seyyed Ebrahim Raisi died, and condolences expressed are registered in the "national memory of Iran". It is something unbelievable for Iran, and regarding the relations, "the supreme leader of Iran respects India, and I as an ambassador of Iran also fully feel the respect of PM Modi and the government of India," he added.</p>

<p>The government of India had declared one-day national mourning on May 21 as a mark of respect to Raisi who had tragically passed away in a helicopter crash.</p>

<p>Elahi said at the strategic level, both countries have a good mindset about each other, and at the operative level, there are "some difficulties".</p>

<p>"We are in good relation with different structures of India to resolve these difficulties, we need some mechanism. Strategically, we see a willingness on both sides. We do not have any problems between the two countries.</p>

<p>"It is important. It is a strategic asset for both the countries. We have been together, we are now together, and we are now working to be in the future," the ambassador said.</p>

<p>India and Persia, as Iran is historically known, are two ancient civilisations and have had ties in trade, culture and other sectors, going back several centuries.</p>

<p>"Iran and India have a long-standing relation, and one aspect of our relation has been people-to-people relations and interactions. Unfortunately, Covid affected this relation. We organised this roadshow to reactivate and revive the good tourism cooperation between the two countries," he said.</p>

<p>"We believe that India needs to know more about the current Iran and development of Iran, as also Iranians also need to know more about India and the development of India, and the capabilities of the cooperation," the envoy added.</p>

<p>The event saw a gathering of different stakeholders of tourism -- travel agencies, airliners and officials from both countries.</p>

<p>"They have the opportunity to discuss different ways to promote tourism between the two countries. We recently have removed or resolved some concerns of Indians, and we have resolved the visa issue.</p>

<p>"Indians can enter Iran for two weeks without any visa, Indian passport holders are exempted from visa.</p>

<p>"Also, when they enter or depart Iran, their passport will not be stamped. So, they do not have concerns regarding travelling or visiting other countries. This is an important issue," Elahi said.</p>

<p>Another important issue is that the number of flights should be increased. Now, there are two direct flights between Delhi and Tehran, which take about three-and-a-half hours. Another flight between Tehran and Mumbai is about less than four hours. "But, we plan to increase the number of flights." "We have asked and approached Indian airlines and trying to explain the capacity of the big market of Iran for Indian airlines. So, Indian carriers can be welcomed to set up direct flight not only from Delhi or Mumbai, but also Hyderabad, and Bangalore, are good markets, and even Kashmir is good. Different cities of the two countries can be connected with direct flights, we welcome and we hope that Indian carriers can set up direct flights," he said.</p>

<p>Asked what is the increased frequency of direct flights he is expecting, the envoy said, "We are expecting at least one flight per day, seven-day-a-week flights." Elahi said this event is just the beginning in the long-drawn aim of cooperation and Iran hopes that after this event will witness promotion and progress in tourism between the two countries, on both sides.</p>

<p>"We are insisting not just to attract Indian tourists, we are also insisting to attract Iranian tourists to India... According to the latest statistics, in the last year, more than 13 million Iranians have travelled abroad, but the portion that went to India is just about 58,000.</p>

<p>"It is nothing, very low (in number). On the other hand, the number of Indian tourists going to Iran, the figure is huge. So, they can benefit from tourism cooperation. And, we hope that it is a good step," he added.</p>

<p>Besides, Indians can not only buy good souvenirs from Iran but they can also do business with Iran during their visit to Iran, the envoy said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Indian-origin astronaut Sunita Williams, who is stuck on the International Space Station (ISS), today said it was her "happy place" and that she "loves" being up there. Ms Williams and her fellow NASA colleague Butch Wilmore on June 5 took off aboard the Boeing's Starliner as part of the vessel's first crewed mission, in what was originally meant to be eight days in orbit. Their stay, however, has been stretched to eight months after the Starliner ran into several technical issues and returned to Earth without them last week.</p>

<p>"That's how things go in this business," <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/sunita-williams-isro-nasa-our-future-couldnt-be-brighter-sunita-williams-on-us-sending-indian-astronaut-to-international-space-station-6081277" target="_blank">Sunita Williams</a> said in a video press conference on being stuck in the space.</p>

<p>Ms Williams said the transition to station life was "not that hard" since both astronauts had previous stints there.</p>

<p>"This is my happy place. I love being up here in space," the veteran astronaut said.</p>

<p>"We wanted to take Starliner to the completion and land back on land at home, but you know, you have to turn the page and look at the next opportunity," she added.</p>

<p>Ms Williams and Mr Wilmore are scheduled to return in February with the Crew-9 flight of billionaire Elon Musk's SpaceX.</p>

<p>Ms Williams said she was a little bit nervous that she was not returning home immediately.</p>

<p>"In the back of my mind, there are folks on the ground who have some plans like my family...spending times with my mother. And I think I was fretting more about that. Like the things we had planned for this fall or winter...but everybody was on board and that prepared us," she said.</p>

<p>Mr Wilmore said he was "absolutely not" let down by the decision to stay in space and indicated there were "disagreements" about how to handle the return.</p>

<p>"We could have gotten to the point, I believe, where we could have returned on Starliner, but we just simply ran out of time," he said in the press conference.</p>

<p>"In this case, we found some things that we just could not get comfortable with putting us back in the Starliner when we had other options," he added.</p>

<h3><strong>Sunita Williams, Butch Willmore To Vote In US Elections From Space</strong></h3>

<p>The two astronauts said they were looking forward to casting their ballot in the 2024 US presidential election from the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/video-indian-origin-astronaut-sunita-williams-dances-on-her-arrival-at-space-station-on-boeing-starliner-with-butch-wilmore-5835758" target="_blank">International Space Station</a>.</p>

<p>Butch Willmore said he has sent down his request for a ballot today.</p>

<p>"It is a very important role that we all play as American citizens," he said. "NASA makes it very easy for us to do that."</p>

<p>Sunita Williams also said it is a "very important duty".</p>

<p>"Looking forward to vote from space, which is pretty cool," she said.</p>

<p>The US elections - a fight between Democrat Kamala Harris and her Republican rival Donald Trump - will be held on November 5.</p>

<h3><strong>Boeing's Starliner Setbacks</strong></h3>

However, a day later, as Starliner was approaching the ISS, NASA and Boeing identified helium leaks and experienced issues with the spacecraft's reaction control thrusters.</p>

<p>Five of Starliner's 28 thrusters failed during flight and it sprang several leaks of helium, which is used to pressurize the thrusters. It was still able to dock with the space station, which has housed rotating crews of astronauts for over two decades.</p>

<p>NASA, however, feared the capsule would not be able to achieve the thrust necessary to return to Earth and decided to transfer the two astronauts to a SpaceX mission and return the Starliner empty.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Last week, Barry "Butch" Wilmore and Sunita "Suni" Williams watched the Boeing Starliner they rode to the ISS three months prior head back to Earth without them.</p>

<p>"We could have gotten to the point, I believe, where we could have returned on Starliner, but we just simply ran out of time," Wilmore said Friday in a video press conference.</p>

<p>On June 5, Wilmore and Williams took off aboard the Starliner as part of the vessel's first crewed mission, in what was originally meant to be eight days in orbit.</p>

<p>After the Starliner ran into several technical issues, their stay is now expected to last for eight months.</p>

<p>Last month, NASA decided Williams and Wilmore would return in February with the Crew-9 flight of Boeing's aerospace rival SpaceX.</p>

<p>Though Wilmore said he was "absolutely not" let down by the decision to stay in space, he indicated there were "disagreements" about how to handle the return.</p>

<p>"In this case, we found some things that we just could not get comfortable with putting us back in the Starliner when we had other options," Wilmore said.</p>

<p>Williams said she was "so happy" Starliner landed on Earth without issues, even if they were not on it.</p>

<p>"We wanted to take Starliner to the completion and land back on land at home, but you know, you have to turn the page and look at the next opportunity," she said.</p>

<p>Both astronauts said the support they have received has helped them transition to the new return timeline.</p>

<p>"I can sum it up in one word, and that's resiliency," Wilmore said. "We are tasked -- and we learn, and we train -- to handle all types of situations."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US Vice President Kamala Harris said on Friday she will cut college degree requirements for certain federal jobs if elected president after the Nov. 5 elections in which she faces Republican former President Donald Trump.</p>

<p>The Democratic presidential candidate said the U.S. should recognize the value of paths to success beyond a college degree, like apprenticeships and technical programs.</p>

<p>"As president, I will get rid of the unnecessary degree requirements for federal jobs to increase jobs for folks without a four-year degree," Harris said in her speech.</p>

<p>A degree does not necessarily indicate a person's skills, Harris said. She added: "And I will challenge the private sector to do the same."</p>

<p>Both Harris and Trump have been trying to appeal to voters with economic pledges. Harris has said she will aim to pass a middle class tax cut. Trump has advocated for cutting taxes on overtime pay. Both have supported eliminating taxes on tips.</p>

<p>Harris' speech in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, also faced some interruption from protesters opposing U.S. support for Israel's war in Gaza that has killed tens of thousands and caused a humanitarian crisis. It followed a deadly Oct. 7 attack on Israel by Palestinian Hamas militants.</p>

<p>Demonstrators in the U.S. have for months demanded an end to the war and restrictions on shipments of weapons to Israel.</p>

<p>Harris reiterated her support for a ceasefire and hostage rescue deal.</p>

<p>"Now is the time to get a hostage deal and ceasefire," Harris said when interrupted. "I respect your voice, but right now, I am speaking," she added.</p>

<p>Harris is in a tight race with Trump. Observers have said that if Muslim and Arab Americans, who overwhelmingly voted for the Democrats in the last presidential election, withhold their vote, it may hurt Harris' chances.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Democrat Vice President Kamala Harris said during Tuesday's debate with Republican Donald Trump that she owns a gun, a revelation that surprised some voters but carried a deliberate political message.</p>

<p>Harris owns a handgun for personal safety reasons, and it is stowed away in a secure location at her California home, a White House source said on Friday. The source declined to identify the make of gun, but said it is the same gun Harris mentioned in 2019 on the campaign trail.</p>

<p><strong>KEY QUOTES</strong></p>

<p>"This business about taking everyone's guns away — Tim Walz and I are both gun owners. We're not taking anybody's guns away, so stop with the continuous lying about this stuff," Harris said on Tuesday, referring to her running mate Walz.</p>

<p>In 2019, Harris told reporters "I am a gun owner, and I own a gun for probably the reason a lot of people do — for personal safety. I was a career prosecutor."</p>

<p><strong>WHY IT'S IMPORTANT:</strong></p>

<p>Harris along with most of her Democratic Party, has pushed for more gun safety legislation to curb the high rate of gun deaths and injuries in the U.S. Republicans blocking this legislation have argued that Democrats want to seize Americans' guns and overturn the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution that gives Americans the right to "bear arms."</p>

<p>Harris is trying to appeal to some voters among the one-third of Americans who own a gun and the two-thirds of Americans who support stronger regulation of gun ownership.</p>

<p><strong>CONTEXT</strong></p>

<p>Harris has called for implementing universal background checks and expanding red flag laws to take away guns from people who are deemed dangerous or unstable. She also wants to ban so-called assault weapons and high-capacity magazines.</p>

<p>"I'm a good marksman," Harris said during an onstage Politico interview in 2015 in California after being asked if she'd ever fired a gun. "Yes, I have shot a gun many times," she said, adding that it was a pistol.</p>

<p>Trump's New York concealed carry license was suspended in April 2023 after his criminal indictment, CNN reported. He turned over two of three pistols he owned and the third was moved to Florida, according to the news outlet.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

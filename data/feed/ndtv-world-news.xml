       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden was seen in public for the first time since he dropped out of the Presidential race and tested positive for COVID-19. His absence <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/wheres-joe-hospice-care-coup-joe-biden-absence-sparks-bizarre-conspiracy-theories-6169799">sparked rumours</a> on social media with several users claiming the 81-year-old leader's health was deteriorating, even claiming he was in "hospice care" and was "unlikely to survive the night".</p>

<p>"Where's Joe" became a top trend on X globally after the US President was out of public eye for five days as he was isolating while recovering from COVID-19 at his Delaware home.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, the Democratic leader <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-president-biden-returns-to-white-house-after-testing-covid-negative-6173945">returned to the White House</a> after his doctors said his symptoms of COVID-19 have been resolved and a rapid antigen test showed he was negative for COVID-19. "I am feeling well," he said.</p>

<p></p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">? UPDATE: President Biden just boarded Air Force One and is on his way back to the White House. <a href="https://t.co/k2wNDleGa3">pic.twitter.com/k2wNDleGa3</a></p>
— Chris D. Jackson (@ChrisDJackson) <a href="https://twitter.com/ChrisDJackson/status/1815807096207933599?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 23, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p></p>

<p>The US President boarded a plane to White House even as reporters shouted questions at him asking him how he felt, why he dropped out of the race and whether his deputy Vice President Kamala Harris could beat the Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.</p>

<p>Biden did not respond to the questions and just gave a quick thumbs up. "It's great to be back at the White House. This afternoon, I arrived back at the Oval Office and sat down with my national security team for my daily intelligence briefing. Serving as your Commander-in-Chief continues to be the greatest honor of my life,” he wrote on X.</p>

<p>While quarantining, the US President announced the sudden withdrawal from his re-election bid after months of staying defiant and insisting he would not drop out of the Presidential race, even as pressure mounted from his party to step aside.</p>

<p>Taking to social media, he announced that he would not be accepting the Democrat nomination and instead "focus all his energies on his duties as president for the remainder of his term". He endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris to replace him as the Democratic candidate to take on rival Donald Trump in the elections later this year.</p>

<p>The leader also announced that he will be addressing the nation on Friday morning, probably to explain his decision to withdraw from the presidential race.</p>

<p>“Tomorrow evening at 8 PM ET, I will address the nation from the Oval Office on what lies ahead, and how I will finish the job for the American people,” he said in a post on X.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Republican presidential candidate and former president Donald Trump is relying on support from billionaires and big corporations, while hers is a people powered campaign, Vice President Kamala Harris said Tuesday.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Republican presidential candidate and former president Donald Trump is relying on support from billionaires and big corporations, while hers is a people powered campaign, Vice President Kamala Harris said Tuesday addressing her first election rally, a day after she became the presumptive presidential nominee of the Democratic Party.</p>

<p>"Donald Trump is relying on support from billionaires and big corporations. He is trading access in exchange for campaign contributions. A couple months ago, you all saw that, at Mar-a-Lago, he literally promised big oil companies, big oil lobbyists, he would do their bidding for $1 billion in campaign donations," Harris, 59, said in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.</p>

<p>"On the other hand, we are running a people-powered campaign. We just had some breaking news. We just had the best 24 hours of grassroots fundraising in presidential campaign history. Because we are a people-powered campaign, that is how you know we will be a people-first presidency," Harris said addressing her maiden campaign rally, less than 50 hours after she entered the race after President Joe Biden dropped out of the race.</p>

<p>"This campaign is also about two different visions for our nation. One, where we are focused on the future. focused on the past. We believe in a future where every person has the opportunity not just to get by, but to get ahead," she said amidst cheers from the audience.</p>

<p>"A future where no child has to grow up in poverty, where every worker has the freedom to join a union, where every person has affordable health care, affordable childcare, and paid family leave. We believe in a future where every senior can retire with dignity. So, all of this is to say building up the middle class will be a defining goal of my presidency. Because here's the thing: we are all here. When our middle class is strong, America is strong," she said.</p>

<p>Harris alleged that Trump wants to take the country backward.</p>

<p>"He and his extreme Project 2025 agenda will weaken the middle class. Like we know we got to take this seriously. …Donald Trump intends to cut Social Security and Medicare. He intends to give tax breaks to billionaires and big corporations and make working families foot the bill," Harris said.</p>

<p>"They intend to end the Affordable Care Act and take us back then to a time when insurance companies had the power to deny people with pre-existing conditions. Remember what that was like? Children with asthma, women who survived breast cancer, grandparents with diabetes. America has tried these failed economic policies before, but we are not going back.. And I'll tell you why we're not going back," she said.</p>

<p>"Because ours is a fight for the future. It is fight for freedom. Generations of Americans before us led the fight for freedom. And now, Wisconsin, the baton is in our hands. We, who believe in the sacred freedom to vote. We'll make sure every American has the ability to cast their ballot and have it counted," Harris said.</p>

<p>"We, who believe that every person in our nation should have the freedom to live safe from the terror of gun violence, will finally pass red flag laws, universal background checks, and an assault weapons ban. We, who believe in reproductive freedom, will stop Donald Trump's extreme abortion bans because we trust women to make decisions about their own body and not have their government tell them what to do," she said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Vice President Kamala Harris is narrowly beating rival Donald Trump in a national presidential poll released Tuesday, one of the first conducted since US President Joe Biden ended his reelection campaign.</p>

<p>Harris holds a two-point lead over Trump, 44 percent to 42 percent, according to the Reuters/Ipsos poll. It was conducted in the two days after Biden announced Sunday he was dropping out of the race and endorsing his vice president.</p>

<p>In the previous week's poll, Harris, 59, and Trump, now the elder in the presidential race at 78, were tied at 44 percent.</p>

<p>Harris, the overwhelming frontrunner for the Democratic nomination who is raking in endorsements and donations as well as pledged delegates, narrowly trails Republican flag-bearer Trump in another survey also released Tuesday.</p>

<p>Both results are within the polls' margins of error.</p>

<p>The new surveys followed both the Republican National Convention, where Trump formally accepted the party's presidential nomination, and Biden's leaving the race.</p>

<p>Harris's performance in the polls, bolstered by the excitement among Democratic voters about the shakeup in the race, shows her apparently neutralizing the bounce that a nominee gets in the days after his or her party's nominating convention.</p>

<p>In a PBS News/NPR/Marist poll conducted Monday, Trump edges Harris with 46 percent to 45 percent of US registered voters, with nine percent undecided.</p>

<p>If third-party candidates or independents are included in the contest, Trump and Harris are tied at 42 percent, with the others far behind.</p>

<p>The PBS News survey notably found that 87 percent of all Americans think Biden's decision to drop out was the right move, a view that crossed partisan and generational lines.</p>

<p>A plurality of respondents (41 percent) said Biden's decision increases Democrats' chances of winning in November, compared to 24 percent who said it decreases the party's odds and 34 percent who said it makes no difference.</p>

<p>Both surveys come in the aftermath of Trump surviving a shock assassination attempt at a Pennsylvania rally on July 13.</p>

<p>Trump maintains a very narrow advantage of 1.6 percentage points against Harris, according to an average of polls collated by RealClearPolitics.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The president took a Binax rapid antigen test and is negative, Dr Kevin O'Connor, Physician to the White House said in a memorandum to the White House Press Secretary.</p>

<p>Biden's "symptoms have resolved," he said.</p>

<p>He did not respond to shouted questions about why he dropped out of the race and whether his deputy Vice President Kamala Harris could beat the Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.</p>

<p>During his quarantine period, the 81-year-old President sent political shockwaves around the country on Sunday with a post on social media announcing that he was not accepting the Democrat nomination.</p>

<p>He added that he would "focus all his energies on his duties as president for the remainder of his term" and offered his full support and endorsement to his vice president, Kamala Harris, as his choice to replace him on the ticket.</p>

<p>The announcement came after mounting pressure about Biden's age and ability to take on Republican rival Trump.</p>

<p>Biden tested positive for COVID-19 while campaigning in Las Vegas on Wednesday and has been isolating at his Delaware home since.</p>

<p>"The President's symptoms have resolved. Over the course of his infection, he never manifested a fever, and his vital signs remained normal, including pulse oximetry. His lungs remained clear," said O'Connor.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Following US Secret Service director Kimberly Cheatle's resignation over agency's handling of former President Trump's protection, President Joe Biden thanked her "for her decades of public service" to the nation.</p>

<p>Biden also stated that he plans to appoint a new director for the USSS soon.</p>

<p>Lauding Cheatle's service, Biden underlined how she has selflessly dedicated and risked her life to protect the country throughout her career in the United States Secret Service.</p>

<p>"Jill and I are grateful to Director Kim Cheatle for her decades of public service. She has selflessly dedicated and risked her life to protect our nation throughout her career in the United States Secret Service. We especially thank her for answering the call to lead the Secret Service during our Administration and we are grateful for her service to our family," a White House release read, quoting the statement from President Joe Biden on Tuesday (local time).</p>

<p>Cheatle's resignation comes amid ongoing probes by lawmakers and an internal government watchdog into how the agency handled Trump's safety and how a gunman nearly killed the Republican presidential candidate for Pennsylvania during a rally this month.</p>

<p>"As a leader, it takes honor, courage, and incredible integrity to take full responsibility for an organization tasked with one of the most challenging jobs in public service," Biden said in a statement.</p>

<p>"The independent review to get to the bottom of what happened on July 13 continues, and I look forward to assessing its conclusions. We all know what happened that day can never happen again. As we move forward, I wish Kim all the best, and I will plan to appoint a new Director soon," he added.</p>

<p>One rallygoer was killed and several others were hurt in the event, which narrowly missed Trump's head.</p>

<p>Trump was on stage at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania when gunshots rang out and Secret Service agents rushed on to the stage. Hours after the shooting, Trump said that the bullet pierced the upper part of his right ear.</p>

<p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) identified the shooter as Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20, from Bethel Park, Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>Demands for Cheatle's resignation were also raised by members of Congress from both parties, and Republicans had been continuously pressing for her impeachment since Trump was shot at the Pennsylvania rally on July 13.</p>

<p>After her Monday public hearing before the House Oversight Committee, where she refused to respond to several of the committee's questions, lawmakers were especially enraged, according to CNN.</p>

<p>Even though Cheatle said there were "significant" and "colossal" issues with the rally's security during her testimony before the House Oversight Committee, she had previously refused to step down.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sri Lanka's government Tuesday formally apologised to the island's Muslim minority for forcing cremations on Covid victims, disregarding WHO assurances that burials in line with Islamic rites were safe.</p>

<p>The cabinet issued an "apology regarding the compulsory cremation policy during the Covid-19 pandemic", the government said in a statement.</p>

<p>It said a new law would guarantee the right to burial or cremation to ensure the funeral customs of Muslims or any other community were not violated in future.</p>

<p>Traditionally, Muslims bury their dead facing Mecca. Sri Lanka's majority Buddhists are typically cremated, as are Hindus.</p>

<p>Muslim representatives in Sri Lanka welcomed the apology, but said their entire community, accounting for about 10 percent of the island's 22 million population, was still traumatised.</p>

<p>"We will now sue two academics -- Meththika Vithanage and Channa Jayasumana -- who were behind the forced cremation policy of the government," Hilmy Ahamed, spokesman for the Muslim Council of Sri Lanka, told AFP.</p>

<p>"We will also seek compensation."</p>

<p>Ahamed said a young Muslim couple suffered untold anguish when their 40-day-old infant was cremated by the state against their wishes.</p>

<p>Then president Gotabaya Rajapaksa banned burials despite his administration facing international condemnation at the UN Human Rights Council and other forums for violating Muslim funeral norms.</p>

<p>In a book published earlier this month, he defended his action saying he was only carrying out "expert advice" from Vithanage, a professor of natural resources, not to let Covid victims be interred.</p>

<p>She has no medical background.</p>

<p>Rajapaksa halted his forced cremations policy in February 2021 following an appeal from then Pakistan prime minister Imran Khan during a visit to Sri Lanka.</p>

<p>The government then allowed burials at the remote Oddamavadi area in the island's east under strict military supervision -- but without the participation of the bereaved family.</p>

<p>Rajapaksa was forced out of office two years ago following months of protests over an unprecedented economic crisis, which had led to shortages of food, fuel and medicines.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Britain's new Labour government announced Tuesday that it will stop housing migrants on a controversial accommodation barge from next year as it tries to clear a backlog of asylum requests.</p>

<p>The interior ministry said the government would not renew the lease for the use of the Bibby Stockholm, moored off England's south coast, when it runs out in January.</p>

<p>Designed to house up to 500 asylum seekers, the accommodation has come under persistent criticism since the previous Conservative government began moving people there last August.</p>

<p>Former prime minister Rishi Sunak's administration said doing so would help lower the costs of housing asylum claimants, many of whom stay in hotels.</p>

<p>But some residents likened the barge to a prison and one man was found dead in a suspected suicide in December.</p>

<p>Last week, between 60 and 100 residents withdrew from meals and organised a two-hour-long sit-in during a protest to urge the government to speed up asylum procedures.</p>

<p>The UK has been grappling with a hefty asylum backlog, which fell to around 86,000 claimants in 2024 from a high of 132,000 last year, according to government data.</p>

<p>According to research group Migration Observatory, over 60 percent had waited for more than six months for an initial decision on their asylum status.</p>

<p>Labour Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has pledged to clear the backlog by speeding up the process of claims.</p>

<p>Her department said continuing the use of the Bibby Stockholm would have cost more than £20 million ($25.8 million) next year, and that scrapping it forms part of the expected £7.7 billion of savings in asylum costs over the next 10 years.</p>

<p>Labour -- winners of the July 4 general election by a landslide -- has also dropped the Conservative government's controversial policy to send some asylum seekers to Rwanda, which had been due to start this month.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Vice President Kamala Harris opened up a marginal two-percentage-point lead over Republican Donald Trump after President Joe Biden ended his re-election campaign and passed the torch to her, a Reuters/Ipsos poll found.</p>

<p>The poll, conducted on Monday and Tuesday, followed both the Republican National Convention where Trump on Thursday formally accepted his party's nomination and the Biden announcement on Sunday he was leaving the race and endorsing Harris.</p>

<p>Harris, whose campaign says she has secured the Democratic nomination, led Trump 44% to 42% in the national poll, a difference within the 3-percentage-point margin of error.</p>

<p>Harris and Trump were tied at 44% in a July 15-16 poll, and Trump led by one percentage point in a July 1-2 poll, both within the same margin of error.</p>

<p>While nationwide surveys give important signals of American support for political candidates, just a handful of competitive states typically tilt the balance in the U.S. Electoral College, which ultimately decides who wins a presidential election.</p>

<p>The most recent poll showed 56% of registered voters agreed with a statement that Harris, 59, was "mentally sharp and able to deal with challenges," compared to 49% who said the same of Trump, 78.</p>

<p>Only 22% of voters assessed Biden that way.</p>

<p>Biden, 81, ended his reelection effort after a debate with Trump in which he often stammered and failed to aggressively challenge attacks by Trump that included falsehoods.</p>

<p>When voters in the survey were shown a hypothetical ballot that included independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Harris led Trump 42% to 38%, an advantage outside the margin of error. Kennedy, favored by 8% of voters in the poll, has yet to qualify for the ballot in many states ahead of the Nov. 5 election.</p>

<p>The poll, which was conducted online, surveyed 1,241 U.S. adults nationwide, including 1,018 registered voters.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>New body camera footage released by the Illinois State Police shows officers shooting dead an unarmed Black woman in her home after she called for help over a possible intruder.</p>

<p>In the United States, where police shootings of minorities have become painfully common and polarizing events, the killing has attracted national attention, with President Joe Biden saying Sonya Massey "should be alive today."</p>

<p>So far one of the police officers involved in this case has been charged with murder.</p>

<p>Massey, 36, called 911 to report a possible intruder at her home, with police arriving after midnight July 6, according to the Sangamon County Sheriff's Office.</p>

<p>In video footage released Monday, Massey is seen talking to two officers in her home, while they ask for ID and she searches through paperwork.</p>

<p>The sheriff's deputies then ask her to check on a pot of boiling water on her stove, saying "we don't need a fire while we're here."</p>

<p>When one of the deputies steps back, Massey asks why, and he responds with a laugh: "away from your hot steaming water."</p>

<p>Holding the pot, Massey calmly responds "Oh, I rebuke you in the name of Jesus" -- prompting a deputy to respond "You better fucking not. I swear to God I'll fucking shoot you at your fucking face," drawing his weapon.</p>

<p>Apologizing, Massey crouches behind a counter as officers scream "drop the fucking pot." They then round the corner of the counter and open fire.</p>

<p>Afterward, one of the officers said they were afraid of "taking fucking boiling water to the fucking head."</p>

<p>Officer Sean Grayson, who is white, has been charged with murder.</p>

<p>Biden on Monday called Massey "a beloved mother, friend, daughter, and young Black woman."</p>

<p>"When we call for help, all of us as Americans -- regardless of who we are or where we live -- should be able to do so without fearing for our lives," he said in a statement.</p>

<p>High-profile civil rights attorney Ben Crump, representing the family of Massey, called it "one of the worst videos of a police shooting ever."</p>

<p>Police shootings and brutality -- especially instances of white on Black violence in a country with a long history of discrimination -- often attract outrage and protests in the United States, as well as defenses and pushback from ardent police supporters.</p>

<p>America's decentralized policing system, where individual towns and counties are responsible for their own policing, means there are no national training requirements and this makes reform extremely difficult.</p>

<p>Adding to complications, the United States is home to more guns than people, meaning police often train for violent encounters with the general public.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle resigned on Tuesday, a day after acknowledging that the agency failed in its mission to prevent an assassination attempt against Donald Trump.</p>

<p>Cheatle was facing bipartisan calls to step down after a 20-year-old gunman wounded the former Republican president and current White House candidate at a July 13 campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>"It is overdue, she should have done this at least a week ago," Mike Johnson, the Republican Speaker of the House of Representatives, told reporters. "I'm happy to see that she has heeded the call of both Republicans and Democrats."</p>

<p>Cheatle appeared before a congressional committee on Monday and said the attack on Trump, who was slightly wounded in his right ear, represented a failure by the Secret Service.</p>

<p>She called it "the most significant operational failure of the Secret Service in decades."</p>

<p>Both Republicans and Democrats called on Cheatle to resign. She drew the ire of lawmakers from both parties by refusing to provide specific details about the attack, citing the existence of multiple active investigations.</p>

<p>The gunman opened fire on Trump with an AR-style assault rifle just minutes after he began speaking at the campaign event.</p>

<p>Perched on the roof of a nearby building, he was shot dead by a Secret Service sniper less than 30 seconds after firing the first of eight shots.</p>

<p>Investigators have concluded the young man, who lived in a town about 50 miles (80 kilometers) from Butler, acted alone, and have not been able to identify any strong ideological or political leanings.</p>

<p>Two rally attendees were seriously wounded and a 50-year-old Pennsylvania firefighter, Corey Comperatore, was shot dead.</p>

<p>Trump's former physician said over the weekend that the Republican candidate sustained a two-centimeter (almost one inch) gunshot wound on his right ear.</p>

<p>"The bullet passed, coming less than a quarter of an inch from entering his head, and struck the top of his right ear," said ex-White House physician Ronny Jackson.</p>

<p>Cheatle served as a Secret Service agent for 27 years before leaving in 2021 to become the head of security in North America for PepsiCo.</p>

<p>She was named to head the agency by President Joe Biden in 2022.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A young pilot died in a "fluke" accident shortly after a group of skydivers exited her plane in upstate New York.</p>

<p>The Niagara County Sheriff's Office confirmed that Melanie Georger, 26, was killed while flying her single-engine Cessna, which crashed on the Niagara Scenic Parkway, about 15 miles from Niagara Falls, on Saturday.</p>

<p>The crash occurred as Ms Georger was attempting to land the aircraft, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/crash-skydiver-plane-new-york-b2583879.html"><em>The Independent</em></a> reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Where it landed was just off the parkway. We look to the west near Fort Niagara, it's full of soccer players today." Michael Filicetti, the county sheriff said in an interview with WIVB on Sunday.</p>

<p>"We're lucky where it landed, but it is an unfortunate incident."</p>

<p>The National Transportation Safety Board is leading the investigation into the incident.</p>

<p>The victim was employed by Skydive the Falls in Youngstown, New York. One of the skydivers, Jeffrey Walker, reported that he exited the plane about 30 minutes before the crash occurred.</p>

<p>"Everything was great," he said. "It was great weather, low winds, very calm winds. Everybody was excited. Everybody was in a good mood."</p>

<p>The passenger stated that he suspected something had gone wrong when the plane rapidly crashed.</p>

<p>"It's not like skydiving planes once a week fall out of the sky and you just kind of dodge it," he said. "This is a fluke accident. Something went wrong."</p>

<p>"For some reason, God left me on Earth and I'm just blessed to still be around," Walker told the TV station. "It's just an eerie feeling that I was on that plane literally a half-hour before it crashed. Why didn't it crash with us on it? Why didn't it crash with more people on it? It's surreal."</p>

<p>Mr Walker described Ms Georger as a good pilot who was great at her job.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I really feel bad for the business and the company she was working for, because they're a great company," he added. "I thought they did a great job training."</p>

<p>Georger's father, Paul Georger, issued a statement on Facebook following her death.</p>

<p>"Friends and family, my life as I know it ended today. My beloved daughter, my best friend and one of the two lights of my life passed away suddenly today," he wrote.</p>

<p>The tribute continued: "Melanie was a pilot, on the cusp of realizing her dream to fly for the airlines. She was doing what she loved, flying for a local skydiving company when her plane crashed. She had discharged her passengers and was flying back to pick another load when she crashed. Kelli, Tim and I are devastated. She was only 26."</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hollywood star George Clooney -- one of the first high-profile Democratic activists to urge Joe Biden not to seek reelection -- on Tuesday announced his backing for Kamala Harris, while hailing Biden's exit.</p>

<p>"President Biden has shown what true leadership is. He's saving democracy once again. We're all so excited to do whatever we can to support Vice President Harris in her historic quest," Clooney said in a statement to CNN.</p>

<p>A major fundraiser for Democratic candidates and longtime Biden booster, Clooney broke ranks two weeks ago by openly calling on the 81-year-old president to give way to a younger candidate so that the party would have a better chance of beating Donald Trump in November.</p>

<p>"I love Joe Biden," Clooney wrote in The New York Times, shocking many. "I consider him a friend, and I believe in him... But the one battle he cannot win is the fight against time."</p>

<p>With Biden at the top of the ticket, the Oscar-winner said, Democrats "are not going to win in November," will lose control of the Senate, and won't gain a majority in the House of Representatives.</p>

<p>After days of mounting pressure, Biden on Sunday abruptly announced he was leaving the race and endorsed his vice president. Harris has rapidly garnered overwhelming support from party leaders and raked in a huge quantity of donations from voters.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>July 21 was the hottest day ever recorded globally, according to preliminary data from the European Union's Copernicus Climate Change Service.</p>

<p>The global average surface air temperature on Sunday reached 17.09 degrees Celsius (62.76 degrees Fahrenheit) - slightly higher than the previous record set last July of 17.08 C (62.74 F).</p>

<p>Heatwaves have scorched large swathes of the United States, Europe and Russia over the past week.</p>

<p>Copernicus confirmed to Reuters that the record daily temperature average set last year appeared to have been broken on Sunday.</p>

<p>Last year saw four days in a row break the record, from July 3 through July 6, as climate change, driven by the burning of fossil fuels, drove extreme heat across the Northern Hemisphere.</p>

<p>Every month since June 2023 - 13 months in a row - has now ranked as the planet's hottest since records began, compared with the corresponding month in previous years, Copernicus said.</p>

<p>Some scientists have suggested 2024 could outrank 2023 as the hottest year since records began, as climate change and the El Nino natural weather phenomenon - which ended in April - have pushed temperatures ever higher this year.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Pete Buttigieg, who earlier made history as the first openly gay Cabinet member, is being looked upon as the potential running mate for Kamala Harris.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Joe Biden on Sunday announced his decision to withdraw from the US Presidential race and endorsed Vice-President Kamala Harris as the Democratic nominee. And now the next question on everyone's mind is, "Who will be Kamala Harris' running mate?"</p>

<p>Pete Buttigieg, the US Secretary of Transportation, is said to be one of the front-runners to become Kamala Harris' deputy, should she get elected to the White House come November 5.</p>

<p><strong>Here are five key facts about Pete Buttigieg</strong></p>

<p>1. Born on January 19, 1982, he is the son of Joseph Buttigieg, who immigrated to the US from Malta, and Jennifer Anne Montgomery. Pete Buttigieg is a graduate of Harvard College as well as the University of Oxford, where he was a Rhodes Scholar. He has completed a degree in philosophy, politics, and economics.</p>

<p>2. Pete Buttigieg earlier served as an officer in the US Navy Reserve between 2009 and 2017. He was reportedly deployed to the war in Afghanistan for around seven months in 2014.&nbsp;</p>

<p>3. Pete Buttigieg earlier made history as the first openly gay Cabinet member after President Biden brought him into the administration as Transportation Secretary. He is married to Chasten Buttigieg, an American teacher, author and activist. The couple have two children.</p>

<p>4. Currently serving as the 19th Secretary of Transportation, after being sworn in on February 3, 2021, Buttigieg was earlier the mayor of his hometown, South Bend, Indiana for two terms (2012-2020). His efforts led to an increase in household income, while the poverty rate came down and unemployment was reportedly cut in half in the region.&nbsp;</p>

<p>5. Popularly known as 'Mayor Pete,' Buttigieg rose to prominence when he ran in the 2020 presidential race. However, he soon dropped out of the Democratic race and ended his roller-coaster campaign. This time, Buttigieg has extended full support to Kamala Harris for the presidential race and said that he "will do all that I can to help elect Kamala Harris the next President of the United States."</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In what was his first meeting in the framework of the diplomatic visit to Washington, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met with the families of the Israeli-American hostages held in the custody of Hamas, earlier on Tuesday, India time.</p>

<p>"I am doing everything in my power to combine the necessary humanitarian objective and the imperative to return the hostages, and at the same time, preserve the existence of the State of Israel," Netanyahu said after the meeting.</p>

<p>"I am not prepared in any way to give in on the victory over Hamas. If we give up on this, we will be in danger in the face of Iran's entire axis of evil," he added.</p>

<p>Several representatives of the families of the hostages who accompanied the Israeli PM on flight to Washington and soldiers who fought on October 7, and who have fought in Gaza, also participated in the meeting which was also attended by Netanyahu's wife Sara.</p>

<p>Representatives of bereaved families who have lost their sons in the fighting in Gaza and the Western Negev were also present at the meeting.</p>

<p>"We are determined to return them all. The conditions for returning them are becoming ripe, for the simple reason that we are putting very strong pressure on Hamas. We see a certain change, and I think that this change will increase," said Netanyahu.</p>

<p>The Israeli PM said that his visit to the US was an important one, one which will give "the opportunity to bring before the representatives of the American people, and the American people themselves the importance of their support".</p>

<p>Israel's top officials, including the Director of the National Security Council, the Director General of the Prime Minister's Office, the Cabinet Secretary, the Prime Minister's Military Secretary and the Coordinator for the Hostages and the Missing, also participated in the meeting.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A top WHO official said Tuesday he was "extremely worried" over possible outbreaks in war-torn Gaza after poliovirus was detected in the sewage, warning that communicable diseases could cause more deaths than injuries.</p>

<p>United Nations agencies said last week that the Global Polio Laboratory Network found vaccine-derived type-2 poliovirus in six environmental samples collected from the sewage in the Gaza Strip on June 23.</p>

<p>Ayadil Saparbekov, the World Health Organization's head of health emergencies in the occupied Palestinian territories, stressed that "we have not yet collected human samples" so it remains unclear if anyone has actually been infected with the virus.</p>

<p>But he acknowledged to reporters in Geneva via video-link from Jerusalem, "I am very much worried".</p>

<p>A type of vaccine against polio -- a crippling and potentially fatal viral disease that mainly affects children under the age of five -- contains small amounts of weakened but live polio which can occasionally cause outbreaks.</p>

<p>Oral polio vaccine (OPV) replicates in the gut and can be passed to others through faecal-contaminated water -- meaning it won't hurt the child who has been vaccinated, but could infect their neighbours in places where hygiene and immunisation levels are low.</p>

<p>While epidemiological studies and risk assessments are continuing, Saparbekov said he was deeply concerned at the prospect of any diseases spreading in Gaza, which is facing a towering humanitarian crisis after more than nine months of war following Hamas's deadly October 7 attack inside Israel.</p>

<p>"I'm extremely worried about outbreaks happening in Gaza," he said, pointing to the confirmation late last year that hepatitis A was spreading, "and now we may have polio".</p>

<p>"With the crippled health system, lack of water and sanitation, as well as lack of access of the population to health services... this is going to be a very bad situation," he warned.</p>

<p>"We may have more people dying of different communicable diseases than from the injury-related diseases."</p>

<p>That says something in Gaza where more than 39,000 people, mostly civilians, have been killed in the war, according to data from the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory military campaign followed Hamas's October 7 attack on southern Israel, which resulted in the deaths of 1,197 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.</p>

<p>The operatives also seized 251 hostages, 116 of whom are still in Gaza, including 44 the Israeli military says are dead.</p>

<p>Saparbekov on Tuesday described a dire situation in Gaza, with only 16 of the territory's 36 hospitals even partially functional.</p>

<p>WHO has long stressed the urgent need for medical evacuations from Gaza for the seriously sick and wounded.</p>

<p>While the WHO in recent months has said around 10,000 people were waiting to leave, Saparbekov suggested the number had surged to "up to 14,000 people who may need to seek medical treatment outside of the Gaza Strip".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Days after President Joe Biden pulled out of the Presidential race, his deputy Kamala Harris became the front-runner to replace him as the Democratic nominee for the November 5 polls. Apart from President Biden himself, leading party figures are rallying behind her. If Harris wins the nomination, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro is favoured to join her on the ticket.</p>

<p>Betting markets put Shapiro at 7/4 odds, followed by North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper at 3/1 and Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear at 5/1.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Who is Josh Shapiro?</strong></p>

<p>1. Josh Shapiro was born on June 20, 1973, and grew up in Pennsylvania. His mother was an educator, and his father was a paediatrician. He studied political science at the University of Rochester and later earned a law degree from Georgetown University in Washington, DC. He now lives in Montgomery County with his wife, Lori, and their four children - three school-age sons and a daughter who attends the University of Pittsburgh.</p>

<p>2. Josh Shapiro, a Democrat, was elected to the Pennsylvania House of Representatives in 2004, serving the 153rd District for eight years. He then served as Chairman of the Montgomery County Board of Commissioners from 2011 to 2017. In 2016, Shapiro was elected Pennsylvania Attorney General and reelected in 2020.&nbsp;</p>

<p>3. During his tenure as Attorney General, Josh Shapiro exposed the Catholic Church's decades-long cover-up of child sexual abuse, identifying 301 predator priests and thousands of victims. He protected healthcare access for nearly 2 million Pennsylvanians and defended reproductive rights and a woman's right to choose. He also held over 100 corrupt officials accountable for breaking the law, regardless of party affiliation. He worked with law enforcement to arrest thousands of drug dealers and remove thousands of illegal guns from the streets. He also supported LGBTQ+ marriage rights. During the 2020 presidential election, Shapiro safeguarded the right to vote and defended Pennsylvania's election results, winning dozens of court cases before and after Election Day.&nbsp;</p>

<p>4. In January 2021, Josh Shapiro began his second term as Attorney General. During this time, he continued to combat the opioid crisis, arresting over 8,000 drug dealers and holding pharmaceutical companies and their CEOs accountable for their role in the COVID-19 epidemic. He secured over $328 million in relief for Pennsylvanians, including seniors, students, and workers, who had been exploited by private lenders and employers.</p>

<p>5. Josh Shapiro also worked on criminal justice reform, creating a database to track police misconduct. He brought together activists and law enforcement to make this happen. In 2022, he made history, receiving the most votes ever in a Pennsylvania governor's race.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After Joe Biden dropped out of the 2024 US Presidential elections, social media has been abuzz with rumours that his health is deteriorating which is why he's been avoiding the public eye.</p>

<p>"Where's Joe" is among the top trends on X (formerly Twitter) globally with people wondering why the US President hasn't made a public appearance in the last five days. The truth: Biden has tested positive for Covid and is isolating, the White House said in a statement last week.</p>

<p>But that hasn't stopped social media users from coming up with theories about the 81-year-old. Several posts claiming that "Joe Biden is in hospice care and unlikely to survive the night" have gone viral on the social platform.</p>

<p>Another theory was floated by Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and his running mate JD Vance. The two leaders hit out at the Democratic party for a "coup" against President Biden to push him out of the race.</p>

<p>When asked if Biden's dropping out of the election was a "coup against Joe Biden," Donald Trump said "Sort of," before Vance jumped in.</p>

<p>"Yeah, I think it is. I mean, look, there's a constitutional process, the 25th Amendment. If Joe Biden can't run for president, he can't serve as president," Vance said in an interview with Fox News.</p>

<p>Biden's decision came after internal pressure by the Democratic Party mounted following a widely criticised debate against Trump on June 27. Vice-President Kamala Harris has won the support of the party's lawmakers to take Biden's place in the Presidential elections.</p>

<p>Joe Biden, after his shock announcement Sunday that he was dropping out of the race to the White House, urged his fellow Democrats on Monday to rally around Harris' candidacy.</p>

<p>"She's the best," he said, his voice still hoarse from Covid.</p>

<p>Harris has less than four months to convince the American public she has what it takes for highest office.</p>

<p>Donald Trump was in the lead in polls in the state against Joe Biden, but it is still too early to know whether he will maintain that lead against Kamala Harris.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Billionaire Mukesh Ambani's Reliance has asked the telecom regulator to review the potential reach of Elon Musk's Starlink and Amazon's Kuiper before awarding satellite spectrum amid concerns local players could suffer, a letter showed on Friday.</p>

<p>Reliance's letter, which is not public, is Mr Ambani's last-ditch effort in an ongoing face-off with Mr Musk over how India should grant spectrum for satellite services. While Reliance has called for an auction, India has sided with Mr Musk who - in line with global trends - wanted an administrative allocation.</p>

<p>In the letter, reviewed by Reuters, Reliance said it carried about 15 billion gigabyte of data every month in India after spending about $23 billion on spectrum auctions over the years, but Starlink would target the same customers with a potential capacity of nearly 18 billion gigabyte of data via its satellites with a likely much lower outlay.</p>

<p>Experts say auctions tend to mean higher initial investments which could have deterred foreign players in favour of Reliance.</p>

<p>"The authority should critically examine the capacities created by these mega ... constellations such as Starlink and Kuiper," the letter dated November 15 said.</p>

<p>A senior government source at the telecom regulator said all feedback being received would be reviewed before making final recommendations, tentatively before the year end. Starlink, Amazon and Reliance did not respond.</p>

<p>Starlink is seeking security clearance for a licence to offer satellite broadband services in India and will get a permit if it satisfies all conditions, Telecom Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia said this week.</p>

<p>Mr Ambani once gave data for free on his mobile plans, and Mr Musk has adopted similarly aggressive tactics. In Kenya, Mr Musk priced Starlink at $10 per month, versus $120 in the US, unsettling local telecom players.</p>

<p>Mr Ambani, Asia's richest man, has more than 479 million Indian telecom users, making Reliance Jio the No. 1 player. Mr Musk's Starlink, a unit of SpaceX, has 6,400 active satellites orbiting Earth providing low-latency broadband to four million customers.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said in an interview published Friday that Donald Trump privately held "more nuanced" positions on Ukraine, days after he spoke with the president-elect of the United States by phone.</p>

<p>Trump's reelection in last week's US presidential vote has raised concerns he could withdraw Washington's significant support for Ukraine once back in the White House.</p>

<p>On the campaign trail, the Republican claimed he could end the fighting within hours and that he would talk directly with Russian President Vladimir Putin.</p>

<p>Scholz, who spoke with Trump by phone on Sunday, told the German Sueddeutsche Zeitung daily his call with the president-elect was "perhaps surprisingly, a very detailed and good conversation".</p>

<p>The two discussed the situation in Ukraine "for a while", according to Scholz, as the 1,000-day mark of Russia's full-scale invasion fast approaches.</p>

<p>Without giving many details, Scholz said he got the impression Trump "has a more nuanced position than is often assumed".</p>

<p>Asked by the paper whether Trump would make a deal over the head of the Ukrainians, Scholz said Trump gave "no indication" that he would.</p>

<p>Germany, for its part, would not accept a "peace by diktat", Scholz said.</p>

<p>Separately on Friday, Scholz spoke by phone with Putin, the first call between the two leaders since December 2022.</p>

<p>Scholz urged Putin to end the war and enter negotiations with Ukraine for a "just and lasting peace".</p>

<p>In the newspaper interview, Scholz stressed that Putin "did not succeed in conquering the entire country".</p>

<p>"NATO has gained two additional members, Finland and Sweden, and is stronger than ever," Scholz said.</p>

<p>"Ukraine has become a strong nation with prospects of joining the European Union and a clear orientation towards Western Europe. It is a country with a very strong army.</p>

<p>"We must not underestimate all of this, even if the high number of dead and injured and the incredible destruction in Ukraine are terrible," Scholz said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The United States will award Taiwanese chip giant TSMC up to $6.6 billion in direct funding to help build several plants on US soil, officials said Friday, finalizing the deal before a new administration enters the White House.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United States will award Taiwanese chip giant TSMC up to $6.6 billion in direct funding to help build several plants on US soil, officials said Friday, finalizing the deal before a new administration enters the White House.</p>

<p>"Today's final agreement with TSMC -- the world's leading manufacturer of advanced semiconductors -- will spur $65 billion dollars of private investment to build three state-of-the-art facilities in Arizona," said President Joe Biden in a statement.</p>

<p>The Biden administration's announcement comes shortly before President-elect Donald Trump takes office. Trump has recently criticized the CHIPS Act, a major law passed during Biden's tenure aimed at strengthening the US semiconductor industry.</p>

<p>While the US government has unveiled over $36 billion in grants through this act, including the award to TSMC, much of the funds remain in the due diligence phase and have not been disbursed.</p>

<p>But once a deal is finalized, funds can start flowing to companies that have hit certain milestones.</p>

<p>TSMC is the second company after Polar Semiconductor to finalize its agreement.</p>

<p>"Currently, the United States does not make on our shores any leading-edge chips, and this is the first time ever that we'll be able to say we will be making these leading-edge chips in the United States," said Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo told reporters Thursday.</p>

<p>"I want to remind everyone that these are the chips that run AI and quantum computing. These are the chips that are in sophisticated military equipment," Raimondo added.</p>

<p>Making these chips in the United States, she noted, helps address a national security liability.</p>

<p>The first of TSMC's three facilities is set to fully open by early-2025, Biden noted.</p>

<p>At full capacity, the three facilities in Arizona are expected to "manufacture tens of millions of leading-edge logic chips that will power products like 5G/6G smartphones, autonomous vehicles, and high-performance computing and AI applications," the Commerce Department said.</p>

<p>It added that "early production yields at the first TSMC plant in Arizona are on par with similar factories in Taiwan."</p>

<p>The investment is anticipated to create around 6,000 direct manufacturing jobs.</p>

<p>A senior US official told reporters on condition of anonymity that they expect at least $1 billion to go to TSMC this year.</p>

<p>Besides the $6.6 billion in direct funding, the United States is also providing up to $5 billion in proposed loans to TSMC Arizona.</p>

<p>While the United States used to make nearly 40 percent of the world's chips, the proportion is now closer to 10 percent -- and none are the most advanced chips.</p>

<p>TSMC shares were down by 0.6 percent in New York early Friday.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>News outlets have begun quitting X, formerly Twitter, once a favourite of global media but now accused of enabling the spread of disinformation under its owner, president-elect Donald Trump ally Elon Musk.</p>

<p>Citing a "harsh and extreme" climate, Sweden's newspaper of reference, the left-liberal Dagens Nyheter (DN), on Friday became third major media outlet to stop publishing its articles on the social media platform.</p>

<p>"Since Elon Musk took over, the platform has increasingly merged with his and Donald Trump's political ambitions," said editor-in-chief Peter Wolodarski.</p>

<p>Already on Wednesday, Britain's centre-left daily The Guardian had announced it would no longer post content from its official accounts on X, which it called "toxic".</p>

<p>A day later, Spain's Vanguardia did the same, saying it would rather lose subscribers than remain on a "disinformation network".</p>

<p>Several users had already wondered back in 2022 whether they should remain on Twitter when Musk -- a businessman best known for running car company Tesla and space company SpaceX -- bought the platform and drastically reduced content moderation in the name of free speech.</p>

<p>The question has flared up again since Trump won this month's presidential election, actively supported by Musk.</p>

<p><strong>'Disturbing content'</strong></p>

<p>"I would expect more publishers to part ways with X," said Stephen Barnard, a specialist on media manipulation at Butler University in the US.</p>

<p>"How many do so will likely depend on what actions X, Musk, and the Trump administration take with regard to media and journalism," he said.</p>

<p>Musk, who is the world's richest man, has been tapped by Trump's team to lead a new Department of Government Efficiency.</p>

<p>The Guardian has nearly 11 million followers on the platform, but it said "the benefits of being on X are now outweighed by the negatives".</p>

<p>It said "often disturbing content" was promoted or found on the platform, singling out "far-right conspiracy theories and racism".</p>

<p>This falling-out stands in stark contrast to the enthusiasm sparked by Twitter in 2008 and 2009.</p>

<p>Back then, media felt they had to be present there to establish direct contact with their audiences as well as with experts and decision-makers.</p>

<p>They found grew "audiences, built brands, developed new reporting practices, formed community, strengthened public engagement", said Barnard.</p>

<p>At the same time, they boosted Twitter's influence.</p>

<p><strong>'Reaping what they sowed'</strong></p>

<p>This increasingly symbiotic relationship may have become detrimental to the media, suggested Mathew Ingram, former chief digital writer for the Columbia Journalism Review.</p>

<p>"Many publishers gave up on reader comments and other forms of interaction and essentially outsourced all of that to social media like Twitter," he said.</p>

<p>"To that extent they are reaping what they sowed."</p>

<p>Criticism of Twitter predates its takeover by Musk and was centred on the network's architecture that was seen favouring polemical debate and instantaneous indignation.</p>

<p>It was also said to give an unbalanced reflection of society, tilting mostly towards higher-income people, and activist users.</p>

<p>The precise impact of the decision by newspapers, already in economic crisis, to leave X is not yet clear, but they already expect readerships to dwindle.</p>

<p>"We will probably lose subscriptions because some readers subscribe after seeing a news story on the social network," Jordi Juan, director of La Vanguardia, told AFP.</p>

<p>But Barnard said any such loss would be limited because, said, "X generates relatively little traffic to news sites compared to other platforms".</p>

<p>In October 2023, six months after American public radio NPR left Twitter, a report from the Nieman Foundation for Journalism deemed the effects of this departure "negligible" in terms of traffic.</p>

<p>One beneficiary of disenchantment with X appears to be Bluesky, a decentralised social media service offering many of the same functions as X.</p>

<p>On Friday, it said it had added one million subscribers within 24 hours. But its 16 million subscribers are still dwarfed by those of X, estimated at several hundreds of millions.</p>

<p>"Strictly speaking, there are no alternatives to what X offers today," Vincent Berthier, head of the technology department at RSF (Reporters Without Borders) told AFP.</p>

<p>"But we may need to invent them."</p>

<p>Berthier called departures from X "a symptom of the failure of democracies to regulate platforms" across the board.</p>

<p>Musk may represent "the radical face of this informational nightmare", said Berthier. "But the problem goes much deeper."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[As humanity faces existential threats, scientists have speculated which species could rise to dominance in the event of human extinction.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The human race lives with myriad existential threats that can come at us from all sides, from the immediate threat of artificial intelligence entering every aspect of life to the terrible consequences of climate change and out of sight but inevitable eternal Earth demise. As we live with these, some scientists have pondered a fascinating question: If humans were to become extinct, which species might rise to dominance?</p>

<p>One of the most interesting candidates could be the octopus, which is known for its intelligence and versatility. This marine animal, highly adaptable, has a unique set of abilities that may make it well-equipped to survive and thrive on Earth in the post-human era-a complex nervous system, problem-solving ability, and capacity for learning and innovation, making them different from all other animals.</p>

<p>Professor Tim Coulson of the University of Oxford said octopuses are supremely intelligent' and have the 'dexterity, curiosity, and ability to communicate with each other." This puts them in a 'pole position' to take over the world one day.</p>

<p>"Octopuses are among the most intelligent, adaptable, and resourceful creatures on Earth," he told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://the-european.eu/story-40026/professor-tim-coulson-on-evolution-and-human-extinction-and-his-surprising-pick-for-earths-next-rulers.html"><em>The European.</em></a></p>

<p>"Octopuses are capable of distinguishing between real and virtual objects, solving puzzles, interacting with their environment, handling intricate tools with their thumb-like tentacles, and thriving in a wide variety of habitats, from deep-sea trenches to coastal regions," he said.</p>

<p>This idea has sparked lively discussions among scientists, who have explored the potential of various species to fill the void left by humanity. The octopus, with its remarkable capabilities, has emerged as a strong contender for this role. Its ability to camouflage, its dexterous limbs, and its advanced cognitive functions make it a formidable creature, capable of overcoming challenges and adapting to changing environments.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Comedian Conan O'Brien, a former late-night television host, will be the emcee for the Oscars for the first time, taking over from fellow funnyman Jimmy Kimmel, organizers said Friday.</p>

<p>O'Brien, 61, will preside over Hollywood's biggest night next March, hoping to maintain -- and even perhaps improve -- on an uptick in ratings seen earlier this year.</p>

<p>"America demanded it and now it's happening: Taco Bell's new Cheesy Chalupa Supreme. In other news, I'm hosting the Oscars," O'Brien quipped in a statement from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.</p>

<p>Academy CEO Bill Kramer and President Janet Yang called O'Brien "the perfect person to help lead our global celebration of film with his brilliant humor, his love of movies and his live TV expertise."</p>

<p>"His remarkable ability to connect with audiences will bring viewers together to do what the Oscars do best -- honor the spectacular films and filmmakers of this year," they said in the statement.</p>

<p>Executive producers Raj Kapoor and Katy Mullan hailed O'Brien as "incredibly witty, charismatic and funny."</p>

<p>O'Brien, a five-time Emmy winner, hosted several late-night talk shows, including "The Tonight Show," and currently hosts the podcast "Conan O'Brien Needs a Friend." He previously served as a writer for "Saturday Night Live."</p>

<p>Kimmel first hosted the Oscars in 2017 and 2018. He was then brought back in 2023 after the previous year's ceremony featured actor Will Smith's infamous on-stage slap of Chris Rock. Kimmel also hosted the gala this past March.</p>

<p>Almost 20 million tuned in for the last Oscars -- a welcome upward trend for organizers of live awards shows, which have been shedding viewers as they compete for viewers with streamers and social media highlight clips.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[SpaceX, the company owned by 'The First Buddy' of US President-elect Donald Trump, is the first big beneficiary of a multi-million dollar deal inked by India's space agency.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>SpaceX, the company owned by 'The First Buddy' of US President-elect Donald Trump, is the first big beneficiary of a multi-million dollar deal inked by India's space agency. Early next week, SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket will take India's most modern communications satellite GSAT-20, also called GSAT N-2, into orbit.</p>

<p>This is the first of many commercial engagements the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) has with SpaceX. While some say ISRO and SpaceX are competitors for low-cost launches, in the global commercial space market no one doubts that SpaceX is way-way ahead.</p>

<p>It is well-known that Donald Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi share a great bond with each calling the other "my friend". The maverick entrepreneur Elon Musk is also friends with both of them, with Elon Musk saying he is "a fan of Modi". The optics and timing of the space launch are just right, but incidentally the deals predate the American election results, and hence the critics of either Washington DC or New Delhi cannot raise "crony capitalism".</p>

<p>The GSAT-N2 will be launched from Cape Canaveral in the US. Made by ISRO, this 4,700 kg satellite was too heavy for Indian rockets to carry, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/isro-preps-us-launch-of-advanced-satellite-gsat-20-for-enabling-in-flight-internet-7026412">hence the foreign commercial launch</a>. India's own rocket 'The Bahubali' or the Launch Vehicle Mark-3 could have at best lifted a maximum of about 4,000-4,100 kg into a geostationary transfer orbit.</p>

<p>India had till now leaned on Arianespace to launch its heavy satellites, but at present it does not have any operational rockets and the only reliable option India had was to go with SpaceX. Chinese rockets are a no-go for India, and Russia is not able to offer its rockets for commercial launches due to the conflict in Ukraine.</p>

<p>"We got a good deal on this maiden launch with SpaceX," Radhakrishnan Durairaj, Chairman and Managing Director of New Space India Ltd (NSIL), the Bengaluru-based commercial arm of ISRO, told NDTV.</p>

<p>"The price for launching this particular satellite... the technical compatibility and also the commercial deals... I would say it was a good deal for us, for launching such a heavy satellite on SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket," he said.</p>

<p>ISRO made GSAT-N2, with a lift-off mass of 4,700 kg, and has a mission life of 14 years. It is a purely commercial launch being front-ended by NSIL. The satellite is equipped with 32 user beams, comprising eight narrow spot beams over the northeast region and 24 wide spot beams over the rest of India. These 32 beams will be supported by hub stations located within mainland India. It will also help enable in-flight Internet connectivity.</p>

<p>Elon Musk and former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy will lead the newly created Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), Donald Trump had announced on Wednesday, according to news agency ANI.</p>

<p>Elon Musk, a fan of PM Modi, during a meeting with the Prime Minister on June 21, 2023 had said, "I'm incredibly excited about the future of India. India has more promise than any large country in the world. He (PM Modi) really cares about India as he's pushing us to make significant investments in India. I am a fan of Modi. It was a fantastic meeting and I like him quite a lot."</p>

<p>It is estimated that this single dedicated commercial launch of the Falcon 9 rocket to lift India's communications satellite will cost $60-70 million.</p>

<p>Over the last few months, the Tesla chief has been asking India to grant SpaceX licence to sell satellite-based Internet services in India using its Starlink Constellation. "I look forward to bringing Starlink to India where it will help remote villages," Elon Musk said in June 2023.</p>

<p>This week, Telecom Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia said Elon Musk-owned Starlink is yet to comply with security norms, and a licence for satellite communications services will be issued only after they meet all the requirements for services in India. The satellite communication services major is in the process of completing all the requirements and will get a licence once they complete the process, the minister added.</p>

<p>"We are more than happy to give them (licence) if they (Starlink) comply with all the conditions. You have to look at it from a security perspective, making sure that all security concerns are addressed. When they do that we will be more than happy to give it. Obviously, they are in the process of doing it," Mr Scindia said.</p>

<p>India has also inked another commercial deal with the Houston-based company Axiom Space to send an Indian astronaut to the International Space Station on-board the SpaceX Falcon 9 and Crew Dragon human space flight system. That deal is expected to cost $60 million. Earnings by SpaceX from the mission to send the astronaut could be much lower as four astronauts are sharing the flight.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Common symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, fever, headaches, and exhaustion, with the risk of dehydration, particularly in vulnerable groups.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the new norovirus strains, often called the "winter vomiting bug," is driving a surge in cases, with infections essentially doubling what would have been seen for this point in the year compared with before Covid, new data show.</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://metro.co.uk/2024/11/15/six-symptoms-kawasaki-virus-people-urged-stay-home-21998603/?ito=article.app.share.top.whatsapp"><em>The Metro, </em></a>the highly contagious virus can also cause diarrhoea and is linked to an especially concerning variant first identified in Kawasaki, Japan. That strain now accounts for nearly 90% of reported infections.</p>

<p>While health officials claim the symptoms of the new strain are not a bit worse than those from previous outbreaks, it is very easy to spread this particular strain, raising concern about the impact of this winter season. While primarily spread through contaminated food, surfaces, and close contact, hygiene measures are important in the prevention of further cases.</p>

<p>"Norovirus is an extremely contagious virus that spreads through contact and can cause sickness and diarrhoea for those infected.Often referred to as the "winter vomiting bug" cases of Norovirus soar over autumn and winter as more people spend time indoors, in close proximity to each other," Dr John Burke, chief medical officer at AXA Health told The Metro.</p>

<p><strong>Norovirus: A Contagious Menace</strong></p>

<p>Norovirus is one of the highly contagious viruses; it spreads as a result of person-to-person contact, touching contaminated surfaces, and many others. While most individuals recover within a few days, it can pose serious health risks, especially for young children, the elderly, and those with weakened immune systems.</p>

<p><strong>Key Symptoms of Norovirus:</strong></p>

<ol>
	<li>Nausea</li>
	<li>Vomiting</li>
	<li>Diarrhea</li>
	<li>Fever</li>
	<li>Headache</li>
	<li>Fatigue</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Preventing the Spread of Norovirus:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Stay Home: If you're infected, stay home for at least 48 hours after symptoms subside.</li>
	<li>Practice Good Hygiene: Wash your hands frequently with soap and water, especially after using the bathroom and before eating. &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Disinfect Surfaces: Clean and disinfect contaminated surfaces, such as countertops, doorknobs, and toilets.</li>
	<li>Avoid Sharing: Refrain from sharing food, drinks, or utensils with others.</li>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The UK today scrambled fighter jets today after it noticed a Russian bomber approach its airspace. While the Royal Air Force was tracking the Russian jet, the Royal Navy found two separate groups of Russian Navy ships near its waters in the English Channel.</p>

<p>Russia has upped its military movement in the Pacific, the Atlantic and the seas around Europe - namely the Mediterranean, the Baltic, and the North seas. UK's Royal Navy, which keeps a close watch over the North sea and the English Channel, both off its borders, noticed a large naval fleet on Thursday.</p>

<p>UK scrambled two Royal Air Force Typhoon jets to keep a check on the Russian Bear-F bomber over the near its airspace. The Royal Navy also sent out warships to shadow two groups of Russian Navy vessels - one heading towards the Atlantic Ocean, and the other on course for the Baltic Sea.</p>

<p>UK's Ministry of Defence has said that this was the second time in three months that Russian military aircraft and naval ships were seen close to its waters and airspace.</p>

<p>"Our adversaries should be in no doubt of our steadfast determination and formidable ability to protect the UK," Luke Pollard, British minister for the armed forces, said in a statement.</p>

<p>This comes days after the UK announced a wave of new sanctions against Russia's military industrial complex and Russian-backed mercenary groups. The latest sanctions by the UK, which are 56 in number, is the largest sanctions package against Russia since May 2023.</p>

<p>According to the UK government, the latest sanctions "disrupt the supply of vital equipment for Vladimir Putin's war machine and exposes the corrupt activities of Russian proxy military groups in Africa."</p>

<p>UK's Foreign Secretary David Lammy had said last week that "Today's measures will continue to push back on the Kremlin's corrosive foreign policy." He went on to say that the latest sanctions will "disrupt the supply of vital equipment for Putin's war machine. And smashing the illicit international networks that Russia has worked so hard to forge."</p>

<p>The foreign secretary further said that "Putin is nearly 1,000 days into a war he thought would only take a few. He will fail and I will continue to bear down on the Kremlin and support the Ukrainian people in their fight for freedom."</p>

<p>In September, the UK was the first NATO member state that initiated the process for Ukraine to be allowed to use British cruise missiles deep inside Russian territory. UK's Prime Minister Keir Starmer had even flown to Washington DC to meet Joe Biden over Ukraine's use of its cruise missiles, forcing Moscow to update its nuclear doctrine in a warning to the West that Russia might even use nuclear weapons to defend itself.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[A Secret Service agent, assigned to Barack Obama's detail, was recently fired after he landed in hot water for allegedly bringing a lover to the former US President's beachfront property in Hawaii.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Secret Service agent, assigned to Barack Obama's detail, was recently fired after he landed in hot water for allegedly bringing a lover to the former US President's beachfront property in Hawaii, according to a new memoir by the law enforcement officer's former girlfriend.</p>

<p>In “Undercover Heartbreak: a Memoir of Trust and Trauma,” Koryeah Dwanyen detailed a series of potential security lapses on the former agent's part while he was trying to woo her, including a time when he sent her photos of the house and even suggested a tour of the mansion when the Obamas weren't home, according to ABC News.</p>

<h2><strong>Allegations</strong></h2>

<p>“No one will know. If anything, I'm the one who could get in trouble," the agent, who was given the pseudonym “Dale" in the book, allegedly told Ms Dwanyen.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“No one will know. If anything, I'm the one who could get in trouble,” says the agent in the memoir, where he is given the pseudonym “Dale.”</p>

<p>As per the ABC report, the incident happened in 2022, while the agent was assigned to protect the former President. As per Ms Dwanyen's book, the agent even tried to get her to fool around in the former first lady Michelle Obama's bathroom.</p>

<p>“We should have sex in Michelle [Obama]'s bathroom, like a mile-high club,” the book, self-published on October 28, claimed he said.</p>

<p>As per the memoir, Ms Dwanyen was vacationing in Martha's Vineyard in 2022 when she met 'Dale', who was assigned to the security detail of the Obama family. At the time, he reportedly told the woman that he was divorced and had been for nearly a decade. She later found out that the agent was still married, according to the book.</p>

<p>Later, during an interview with ABC, Dwanyen said, “There were major red flags -- breaches of trust and of his job."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Acting on her concern, Ms Dwanyen said, she sent an email to the agent's boss -- whom she had met "several times" in Hawaii --outlining her concerns about “breaches of trust and of his job”.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The secret service agent's boss took the matter seriously and started an investigation. “They realized that not only had ‘Dale' shared photos of the Obamas' house, but he had also brought me there,” Ms Dwanyen wrote in the book.</p>

<p>It was also found that the agent had allegedly also taken photos of “pictures of Alicia Keys' house, Steven Spielberg's boats, Melinda Gates, Tyler Perry and Amal Clooney.” He has also shared background information on former vice president Mike Pence, who he had allegedly been assigned to during the Trump Administration, she said.</p>

<p>According to Ms Dwanyen, 'Dale' shared some “personal tidbits" with her which "he should not have" about the people he was protecting. "I knew their code names. I knew what day Orange Theory was, what day [Michelle Obama] had private tennis lessons and when her personal trainer came...Things that I should not have been privy to as a civilian," she said.</p>

<h3><strong>Agent Fired</strong></h3>

<p>After the allegations surfaced, the Secret Service launched an internal investigation following which the agent was fired for alleged violations of fundamental regulations.</p>

<p>“On Nov. 6, 2022, a Secret Service agent involved in protective functions brought an individual who did not have authorized access into a protectee's residence without permission," Anthony Guglielmi, the agency's chief of communications, told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/memoir-obama-secret-service-breached-security/story?id=115753131" rel="No follow, no index" target="_blank">ABC</a> News.</p>

<p>"As soon as the Secret Service became aware of the incident, the agent involved was immediately suspended and after a full investigation, terminated," he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Guglielmi stressed that the US Secret Service's top priority is ensuring the safety and security of its protectees, "and any actions that compromise this commitment are addressed with the utmost seriousness."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Who would have thought that the viral blue-eyed tea seller would one day demand Rs 1 crore (around Rs 30 lakh Indian rupees) on Shark Tank Pakistan for a five per cent equity in his cafe called Cafe Chai Wala?</p>

<p>Dressed in a swanky black suit, Arshad Khan walked through the doors of Shark Tank Pakistan with his business partner Kazim Hasan. On the show, he talked about his acclaim and urged the judges to invest in his business.</p>

<p>He said, "I had never left Islamabad before that. A lot of people advised me to start my own cafe. I had always wanted my own cafe, even when I was working at somebody else's dhaba."</p>

<p>His first cafe took a sad turn when the pandemic hit in 2020 but he relaunched it again in October of the same year, and has been profiting off it. Surprisingly he also has two operational cafes in Pakistan. They also have three outlets operating in England functioning in a franchise model which yields him 35,000 Pakistani rupees for five per cent royalty.</p>

<p>He added that he wanted to open more such profitable outlets all across the world and showed his vision for expansion. He justified his expansion in London citing his strategy to tap into the South Asian diaspora and also to phase in Pakistani culture abroad.</p>

<p>The cafe's design spells Pakistani motifs and elements, borrowing from street aesthetics which makes it unique.</p>

<p>Two sharks - Junaid Iqbal and Faisal Aftab appreciated Khan's ideas but rejected the deal specifying lack of insight in the hospitality industry. However, Shark Rabeel Warraich offered Khan and Kazim 1 crore rupees for 24 per cent in equity but finally they got a double shark deal with an addition of Romanna Dada for the same amount. Another shark, Usman Bashir offered a deal to join in with the other two sharks for a combined equity of 30 per cent.</p>

<p>Regardless, after some back and forth, they settled for the previous double-shark-deal of 1 crore for an equity of 25 per cent.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[The sweeping mandate to the left coalition underlines widening support for his leftist policies, giving him the power to push through his plans to fight poverty and graft in the island nation struggling to emerge from the worst financial crisis.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake-led National People's Power (NPP) party achieved a landslide victory on Friday in the snap parliamentary election. The sweeping mandate to Mr Dissanayake's coalition underlines widening support for his leftist policies, giving him the power to push through his plans to fight poverty and graft in the island nation struggling to emerge from the worst financial crisis since its independence from the British in 1948.</p>

<p>The 55-year-old leader had announced the parliamentary polls shortly after his election as president in September. His leftist coalition's victory marks a significant shift in Sri Lankan politics as the South Asian nation grapples with the aftermath of the mass protests that ousted former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa in 2022.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Snap Poll Results</strong></h2>

<p>In the previous parliament, NPP had just three seats, but after Friday's landslide victory, it got a two-thirds majority in the 225-member house. The Rajapaksa family's Podujana Peramuna party, whose cohort of brothers gave Sri Lanka two presidents during a dozen years in power and had 145 seats in the outgoing legislature, was virtually wiped out, winning just three seats.</p>

<p>The NPP secured almost 62 per cent or almost 7 million votes, up from the 42 per cent Mr Dissanayake won in September. This indicates that the new President has drawn more widespread support including from minorities. The party dominated the Jaffna electoral district – the heartland of the nation's Tamil minority.</p>

<p>Dissanayake dissolved parliament on September 24 to clear the way for the general election, days after the Marxist-leaning leader was elected president on a platform for change. The election became necessary as Dissanayake had just three lawmakers in the outgoing parliament - whose five-year term was due to end in August 2025 - and needed a fresh mandate to push his policies.</p>

<p>Voters directly elect 196 members to parliament from 22 constituencies under a proportional representation system. The remaining 29 seats will be allocated according to the island-wide proportional vote obtained by each party.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>New Challenges Ahead</strong></h3>

<p>In Sri Lanka, the president wields executive power, but Mr Dissanayake still required a parliamentary majority to appoint a fully-fledged cabinet to deliver on key promises to cut taxes, support local businesses, and fight poverty.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A nation of 22 million, Sri Lanka was crushed by a 2022 economic crisis triggered by a severe shortage of foreign currency that pushed it into a sovereign default and caused its economy to shrink by 7.3 per cent in 2022 and 2.3 per cent last year. Boosted by a USD 2.9 billion bailout programme from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the economy has begun a tentative recovery, but the high cost of living is still a critical issue for many, especially the poor.</p>

<p>Now, with more control over the government, the new president will face the challenge of steering the island nation towards economic recovery while also addressing the pressing issues of inflation and the cost of living.</p>

<p>He promised to slash taxes and introduce stronger welfare support for millions of poor people. He also aims to tweak targets set by the IMF to rein in income tax and free up funds to invest in welfare for the millions hit hardest by the crisis. However, investors worry his desire to revisit the terms of the IMF bailout could delay future disbursements, making it harder for Sri Lanka to hit a key primary surplus target of 2.3 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2025 as set by the IMF.</p>

<p>"The president has a huge mandate now to carry through the reforms but also huge expectations from the people," a report by Reuters quoted Bhavani Fonseka, a researcher at Colombo's Centre for Policy Alternatives, as saying.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"This is unprecedented, we haven't seen this kind of victory before. People voted for a change," she added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the President said any changes to the contours of the IMF programme would be undertaken in consultation with the fund and that he is committed to ensuring repayment of debt.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The new government is also expected to face talent issues, as the coalition has few leaders with governance and policy-making experience.</p>

<p>Moreover, while he was in opposition, Mr Dissanayake had argued against the massive powers of the executive presidency and its links to abuse of power. Now, with a two-thirds majority, the President can begin the process of abolishing the executive presidency, although analysts say that is not a pressing concern and is unlikely to be a priority.</p>

<h3><strong>What Does Dissanayake's Victory Mean For India?</strong></h3>

<p>Mr Dissanayake is the leader of Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP), a party that had historically kept distance from India. JVP was also one of the parties that vehemently opposed the Indo-Lanka accord of 1987, signed by Sri Lanka's then-president JR Jayewardene and India's Rajiv Gandhi. The party spearheaded an insurrection to oppose Indian influence over Sri Lanka after the signing of the accord, which was put down by the administration.</p>

<p>However, despite his party's stance against India, Mr Dissanayake has expressed a desire to engage with India and maintain cordial relations. In September, during an interview with The Monocle, a global affairs and lifestyle magazine, Mr Dissanayake said he wants to avoid being "sandwiched" between India and China but recognises each as a "valued partner".</p>

<p>The former grassroots leader made it clear he intends to steer clear of geopolitical rumblings in South Asia or the Indian Ocean region. "There are many power camps within a multipolar system... but we won't be part of that geopolitical fight, nor will we be aligned with any party. We also don't want to be sandwiched, especially between China and India. Both are valued friends and we expect them to become closer partners," he said.&nbsp;<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer's office on Friday apologised for a “mistake” in the organisation of its Diwali reception at 10 Downing Street after some British Hindus objected to non-vegetarian food and alcohol being served at the gathering.</p>

<p>While the statement did not make a direct reference to the menu, a spokesperson for Starmer's office said the team acknowledged the strength of feeling on the issue and assured the community that it would not be repeated in future.</p>

<p>“The Prime Minister was pleased to welcome a range of communities celebrating Diwali to a reception in Downing Street,” a Downing Street spokesperson said.</p>

<p>“He paid tribute to the huge contribution the British Hindu, Sikh and Jain communities make to our country and how the government is driven by the shared values of hard work, ambition and aspiration. A mistake was made in the organisation of the event," the spokesperson said.</p>

<p>"We understand the strength of feeling on this issue and so would apologise to the community and assure them it will not happen again,” the spokesperson added.</p>

<p>The statement came a day after British Indian Conservative Party MP Shivani Raja issued a formal letter to Starmer expressing concerns over the reception not being “in keeping with the customs of many Hindus”.</p>

<p>“I feel it speaks poorly against the organisation of this year's event – with a disappointing lack of knowledge of the customs and traditions that many British citizens hold dear,” reads her letter posted on social media.</p>

<p>“As a practising Hindu representing thousands of Hindus within my own constituency of Leicester East, I have been deeply saddened to hear that this year's festivities were overshadowed in the greatest Office of State by negativity, as a result of this oversight,” said the first-time Tory member of Parliament elected in July from the city of Leicester.</p>

<p>The Opposition MP went on to offer her “assistance and guidance” to the Labour Party government for all future Hindu celebrations to ensure they are celebrated in a “respectful manner”.</p>

<p>The Downing Street event held on October 29 marked the first Diwali reception since Labour was elected to government in the general election four months ago. It brought together British Indian community leaders, professionals and parliamentarians. However, community organisation Insight UK questioned the “appalling lack of understanding” of the spiritual aspect of the Hindu festival and a few others pointed out that greater consultation is required ahead of such religious events after reports emerged of meat and alcohol being served at the gathering.</p>

<p>The reception has been held regularly over the years at Downing Street and insiders indicated Starmer was keen to follow in the footsteps of Rishi Sunak as the first British Hindu Prime Minister of Britain and light candles on the doorstep of 10 Downing Street to mark Diwali.</p>

<p>“We value and respect your heritage and traditions, and recognise the strength of our shared values and the celebration of Diwali – a time of coming together, of abundance, and welcome,” read excerpts released from Starmer's address at the event.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Noticing the rotors of an Apache helicopter making unusual movements at a military training area in the UK, maintenance staff decided to check and were surprised to find two soldiers having sex inside. The British soldiers were reportedly drunk at the time.</p>

<p>The ground staff had finished servicing the highly armed Apache chopper, worth 8.5 million euros and equipped with 30mm cannon and Hellfire missiles, during their night time routine work when the up and down swaying of the rotors caught their attention, according to the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/two-drunk-air-corps-soldiers-34105619">Mirror</a>.&nbsp;They even heard strange noises coming from the helicopter and when they decided to look what was causing them, they found two soldiers, half naked, squeezed into the rear cockpit of the helicopter engaged in sexual activity in a drunken state, say media reports. While the man was dressed in his army uniform, the woman was in civilian attire.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Both the soldiers were asked to come out of the helicopter and get dressed, according to a report to the Military Aviation Authority. "It became apparent that the rear cockpit was occupied by two people engaged in sexual intercourse. Both were naked from the waist down - the male in uniform, the female in civilian attire," said the report.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"They were ordered to exit the cockpit and get dressed. Both parties were serving soldiers. Both showed symptoms of intoxication," it added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While the chopper they were caught in belonged to Army Air Corps' 653 Squadron, they were part of a different army unit. They were detained till their parent unit and the chain of command of 653 Squadron arrived at the spot, said the Military Aviation Authority report.</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/31702339/solders-caught-apache-chopper-romp/">the Sun</a>, the incident happened back in 2016 at the Otterburn range in Northumberland. However, it has become public recently due to a technical glitch. Air Crew were reportedly later asked to make sure the choppers were locked and secure in future.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump did not lose a minute to assemble his new cabinet ministers, but that has received quite extreme reactions. The structure of Trump 2.0 White House has left leaders "stunned" and "appalled", with some of his choices even rubbing Republicans the wrong way. George Conway, a lawyer and activist said that Trump's nominations, "would arguably have been the worst in American history".</p>

<h2><strong>Tulsi Gabbard - Director of National Intelligence</strong></h2>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-11/s7vp5rvg_tulsi-gabbard-reuters_625x300_14_November_24.jpeg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>

</div>

<p>Trump's decision to nominate Tulsi Gabbard as Director of National Intelligence has raised concerns among national security experts. Gabbard, a former Democratic congresswoman from Hawaii, lacks formal intelligence experience, sparking worries about her ability to lead the intelligence community.</p>

<p>Her background is marked by a significant shift in political allegiance, having run for president in the Democratic primaries in 2020, only to leave the party in 2022 and endorse Trump. This drastic change has led some to question her suitability for the role.</p>

<p>Gabbard's experience includes serving on the House Committee on Homeland Security for two years, but she has never held a senior government position or worked directly in intelligence. Her anti-interventionist stance, advocating for US non-involvement in global conflicts, has also been at odds with the US Intelligence Community's decisions.</p>

<p>The nomination has been met with scepticism from some members of Congress, including Democratic Representative Abigail Spanberger, a former CIA officer, who expressed her dismay on social media.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Not only is [Gabbard] ill-prepared and unqualified, but she traffics in conspiracy theories and cosies up to dictators like Bashar-al Assad and Vladimir Putin," Spanberg said.</p>

<p>Jamie Metzl, a former Clinton administration official said, "If you are part of a foreign government, even an allied government, are you really going to want to share your most important intelligence with the United States government, recognizing that there are people who are at central nodes in our government who are so sympathetic to our adversaries?" he asked. "It's really concerning."</p>

<p>With Gabbard's unconventional background and shifting political loyalties, concerns about her ability to effectively lead the intelligence community remain.</p>

<h3><strong>Matt Gaetz - Attorney General</strong></h3>

</div>

<p>Matt Gaetz, a U.S. congressman from Florida since 2017, has been nominated by President-elect Donald Trump for attorney general, sparking controversy due to pending allegations of sexual misconduct and illicit drug use.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Gaetz resigned from his House seat just hours after Trump's announcement on Wednesday, amid a scheduled House Ethics Committee vote on releasing the results of an extensive investigation into these allegations, which Gaetz denies.</p>

<p>As attorney general, Gaetz would oversee the Justice Department, which has been investigating him for years on sex trafficking and obstruction of justice allegations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Notably, Gaetz was informed last year that he wouldn't face charges, but the House ethics investigation remains ongoing.</p>

<p>The nomination caught fellow Republicans off guard, with CNN reporting an "audible gasp" from House Republicans during a closed-door meeting when the news broke.</p>

<p>"I was shocked at the nomination," Senator Susan Collins said when she first heard about the announcement.</p>

<p>Republican Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski said, "Do you think he's a serious candidate? Not as far as I'm concerned."</p>

<p>Gaetz's appointment has raised concerns, given the serious allegations against him and the significant role of the attorney general in leading the Justice Department. Trump's decision to nominate Gaetz highlights the contentious nature of his cabinet selections following his presidential election victory against Democrat Kamala Harris.</p>

<h3><strong>Robert F Kennedy Jr - Health Secretary</strong></h3>

</div>

<p>Donald Trump's nomination of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as Secretary of Health and Human Services has sparked widespread criticism due to Kennedy's history of promoting debunked health-related conspiracy theories, particularly his anti-vaccine stance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As a member of one of America's most prominent political families, being the son of late Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy and nephew of President John F. Kennedy, his views have drawn significant attention.</p>

<p>He is anti-vaccination and has claimed vaccines are linked to autism, despite evidence disproving this claim. He advocates for removing fluoride from public drinking water, contrary to CDC recommendations that highlight its benefits in preventing cavities and promoting oral health.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He also supports the consumption of raw milk and the use of ivermectin as a COVID-19 treatment, both of which have been disputed by health experts. Kennedy has also made unusual claims about his own health, including having a brain worm which "ate a portion of it and then died".</p>

<p>Public Citizen, a non-profit, progressive consumer rights advocacy group, said, "Robert F Kennedy Jr is a clear and present danger to the nation's health. He shouldn't be allowed in the building at the department of health and human services (HHS), let alone be placed in charge of the nation's public health agency."</p>

<p>These views have raised concerns about Kennedy's potential impact on the nation's health policies, especially considering his plans to tackle America's substance abuse crisis, an issue he has personal experience with, as he was addicted to heroin for 14 years during his youth.</p>

<h3><strong>Pete Hegseth - Defense Secretary</strong></h3>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="The structure of Trump 2.0 White House has left leaders “stunned” and “appalled”." id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-11/20avf5e_pete-hegseth-twitter_625x300_15_November_24.jpg" title="The structure of Trump 2.0 White House has left leaders “stunned” and “appalled”." /></div>

<p class="ins_instory_dv_caption"><span class="ins_instory_span_credit">Photo Credit: X account of @PeteHegseth</span></p>
</div>

<p>President-elect Donald Trump has nominated Pete Hegseth, a Fox News host, as his Secretary of Defense, despite Hegseth's past criticism of Trump's foreign policy and military stances during the 2016 campaign. Hegseth had called Trump's foreign policy views "shallow" but later became a strong supporter.</p>

<p>Hegseth's nomination is notable, given his unconventional background for the role. He has served in the Minnesota Army National Guard and was deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan, earning several awards, including the Bronze Star Medal.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, his views on certain issues may raise concerns. For instance, Hegseth opposes women serving in combat roles, arguing it lowers military standards and effectiveness. "Women shouldn't be in combat at all. They're life-givers, not life-takers. I know a lot of wonderful soldiers, female soldiers, who have served, who are great. But they shouldn't be in my infantry battalion," he told Ben Shapiro, a conservative political commentator in an interview.</p>

<p>He supports troops accused or convicted of war crimes and has advocated for their pardon. He also wants to fire senior officers who support "woke policies".</p>

<p>Given these stances, Hegseth may face a challenging confirmation process in the Senate. His nomination has already sparked controversy, highlighting the need for careful consideration of his qualifications and views.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"He is the least qualified person in history of the job," said a former defence official from Trump's administration.</p>

<p>As a Fox News personality, Hegseth has been vocal about his opinions, but as Secretary of Defense, his decisions would have far-reaching implications for national security.<br />

</div>

<p>If you're looking for an insight that helps explain what happened in the US Presidential election and why it happened, consider this observation from a key player in US politics: “There is a difference between what offends people and what affects them.”</p>

<p>Donald Trump offends people as if it were a religion. His constant lying offends; his cruelty offends; his racism offends; his misogyny offends; his open contempt for “losers” offends; his lack of remorse offends; his vanity offends; his affinity for chaos offends; his admiration for dictators offends; his vow for retribution and revenge against the “enemies of the people” (anyone who has crossed him or might cross him) offends; his promise to begin “mass deportation” of “25 million” illegal immigrants on Day 1 offends; his vow to upend world trade by imposing a 20% tariff on all goods and 60% on Chinese goods offends; his promise to “protect women whether they like it or not” offends; his commitment to dismiss climate change and pursue a “drill, baby, drill” energy policy offends; his commitment to end Obamacare offends. The list is endless.</p>

<h2><strong>It's Trump's World...</strong></h2>

<p>Yet, Trump is the first Republican in 20 years to win the popular vote, and the MAGA movement has given him unfettered power by securing both the Senate and the House. The US Supreme Court is already aligned with him 6-3 and has effectively granted him virtual immunity from any presidential acts. Project 2025 has a blueprint ready to fulfil his promise to crush the “Deep State” (i.e., federal officials committed to the Constitution and the rule of law) and replace up to 50,000 federal employees with loyalists. The independence of the Federal Reserve and the Justice Department will be under threat. All of this has been clear as daylight since Trump announced his re-run in December 2022.</p>

<p>But Trump won because he successfully positioned himself as the Agent of Change (‘Trump will Fix It'), addressing the issues that affect his core voter base—62% of Americans without a college degree. These voters, who typically show little interest in politics but are deeply focused on improving their material well-being and preserving their cultural values, were key to his success.</p>

<p>And what affects them? Some of the most important issues include rising costs over the last four years: grocery prices up 20%, rents up 40%. There are also concerns about men's self-image: girls outperforming boys in school and college, the #MeToo movement, and college-educated women seeing the highest increases in income and status. Then there is what many perceive as the imposition of ‘Wokeism': it's not just about accepting the full rights and recognition of the LGBTQ community, but also about children having the right to change their gender before adulthood.</p>

<h2><strong>The Fear Of Immigrants</strong></h2>

<p>In some cases, there are deeply held beliefs based on fear and misinformation. I know a Texas-based psychotherapist whose patient confided that she was afraid to go out at night due to fear of immigrants, even though she employs a migrant—likely an undocumented worker—as a housekeeper. Another patient believes Trump was sent by God and that the opposition party was sent by the Devil. Neither patient suffers from psychosis; these are culturally sanctioned beliefs, according to the therapist.</p>

<p>Finally, there are outright misconceptions—such as the belief that tariffs won't raise the cost of household goods, or that Trump's first term, with no new wars, proves he could end the Ukraine and Middle East conflicts immediately upon taking office. There is also the notion that the mass deportation of illegal immigrants would not cripple industries that rely heavily on immigrant labour, like the US meat industry. According to The Economist, roughly half of the labour on US farms is undocumented.</p>

<p>This same Texas-based psychotherapist couldn't believe his eyes when he saw a massive billboard in rural Texas proclaiming, “Born in New York, Thinks Like a Texan.” That's the story Trump sold to voters. And in politics—especially electoral politics—perception is reality.</p>

<h2><strong>Is There Really A Tectonic Shift?</strong></h2>

<p>Yet, even in the face of what some view as an impending apocalypse for the Democratic Party, it's important to note that Trump's win in the popular vote was narrow: 75.8 million votes (50.2%) to Kamala Harris's 72.8 million votes (48.2%), with nearly all votes counted. In 2016, Biden led Trump by 7 million votes. But credit where it's due—Trump won the popular vote by actively pursuing it, rallying supporters in New York and California, even though those blue states' electoral college votes were never in play for him. This effort came in the final weeks of the campaign when conventional wisdom would suggest focusing on the seven key swing states.</p>

<p>How true is the talk of a tectonic shift in the vote and the creation of a new Republican social coalition? It is true that the identity that moved the non-White vote to Trump was their working-class, non-college-educated identity. These voters believed that Trump would do a better job of bringing back jobs lost to Mexico, addressing their affordability crisis, preserving their conservative cultural values, and securing their legal immigrant status by deporting illegal immigrants.</p>

<p>None of this should have come as a surprise. Pre-election polls from <em>The New York Times </em>found a surprising affinity between Trump's views and those of Latinos and Black voters. Four out of ten Hispanic voters and one out of five Black voters had a favourable impression of Trump. A majority of them sympathized with his “America First” foreign policy. Only 20% of Hispanic voters and 26% of Black voters felt that the economic conditions were good or excellent. Median weekly wages for full-time Black workers had risen steeply during Trump's presidency but essentially stagnated under Biden.</p>

<p>However, in absolute numbers, the shift in the non-White vote has not been as significant as it is often portrayed, as columnist Thomas Edsall points out in the <em>NYT</em>. “Roughly six in ten Hispanics voted for Joe Biden; five in ten for Kamala Harris. Nine out of ten Black voters chose Biden; eight in ten for Harris. More than four-fifths of Trump's votes came from White voters.”</p>

<p>Trump won because he has excellent political instincts and because people know exactly what he stands for. His views on trade and immigration were shaped years before he entered politics. “I believe very strongly in tariffs,” he told a journalist in 1989. “America is being ripped off.” In his 2000 book,&nbsp;<em>The America We Deserve</em>, he wrote that “our current laxness toward illegal immigration shows a recklessness and disregard for those who live here legally.”</p>

<h2><strong>Rich-Poor Divide</strong></h2>

<p>What is particularly disturbing for the Democratic Party is that this election has reinforced the post-2012 electoral reality: the less well-off are siding with Trump, while the college-educated, coastal elites are aligned with the Democrats. With White Americans comprising 67% of the population and 62% of Americans lacking a college degree, the Democrats will need to look beyond conventional politicians—those who twist and turn their positions to conform, always erring on the side of caution—to lead the fightback.</p>

<p>Yet, as we all know, Trump can be his own worst enemy. He is entirely transactional. For him, loyalty is always one-way. His insecurity prevents him from sharing the limelight with anyone else. His vanity leaves him vulnerable to manipulation. Not surprisingly, he is not the best judge of character, and his loyalists continue to cycle through a revolving door.</p>

<h2><strong>Team Trump, 2.0</strong></h2>

<p>The quote at the beginning of this column is from Kellyanne Conway, the Republican pollster who worked with Trump from 2013 and managed his 2016 campaign. She later joined the first Trump administration but left amid a public feud with her teenage daughter in August 2020, who lambasted her personally and politically and even threatened legal separation.</p>

<p>Conway is not the only person who was once with Trump but is no longer. Steve Bannon, Trump's chief ideologue and speechwriter, is not in the fold anymore. In his place is Stephen Miller, the architect of Trump's hardline immigration policies. Trump's daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner have been replaced by Don Jr., who is now in charge of conducting the “loyalty test” for anyone seeking to join the administration. John Kelly, Trump's longest-serving Chief of Staff who called him a “fascist,” has been replaced by Susie Wiles, Trump's campaign manager. Wiles is known for her discipline and focus on facilitating whatever catches Trump's fancy. The big question is: how long will she last?</p>

<p>The <em>New York Times</em>—which Trump both loathes and loves to read—has come in for criticism for suggesting that Trump will be a “lame duck” president, given that the 22nd Amendment to the US Constitution prohibits a third presidential term. Critics accused the paper of sour grapes. However, in an unintended way, the paper has highlighted Trump's main dilemma: what legacy does he want to leave behind? He has mined the deep divide and distrust of Washington in US society to become the most dominant figure in American politics for the past decade. Does he now pivot to statesmanship and attempt to unite the country? Or does he pander to his MAGA base and give full rein to his thirst for revenge?</p>

<h2><strong>Rein Of Uncertainty</strong></h2>

<p>The early signs are ominous. Trump's nomination of the highly controversial Congressman Matt Gaetz, who is under investigation for ethics violations, as Attorney General has even alarmed <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>. “He's a nominee for those who want the law used for political revenge, and it won't end well,” the paper warned.</p>

<p>Similarly, the case of <em>Fox News </em>host Pete Hegseth, who has been outspoken against the Pentagon's “woke” policies regarding racial and transgender equity, and the appointment of former Democratic presidential contender Tulsi Gabbard, now a Trump loyalist, as Director of National Intelligence, raise further concerns. Gabbard has shown no evidence of expertise in intelligence. No one should be surprised by this turn of events.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sri Lankan President <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/sri-lanka-election-results-president-anura-dissanayakes-national-peoples-power-party-wins-parliamentary-majority-7023890">Anura Kumara Dissanayake</a>'s leftist coalition, the National People's Power (NPP), secured a decisive victory in snap legislative elections, with voters rejecting establishment parties widely criticised for sparking an economic crisis. The election results, released Friday, showed overwhelming support for Mr Dissanayake's anti-corruption platform and promise to recover assets lost due to corruption.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The self-avowed Marxist called for swift parliamentary polls to consolidate backing for his reform agenda. Friday results showed his decision paid off, with the NPP capturing at least 123 seats in the 225-member parliament, with projections suggesting further gains. Early tallies showed the NPP with 62 per cent of the vote, far ahead of opposition leader Sajith Premadasa's party, which trailed with just 18 per cent.<br />
<br />
<strong>Here are some facts about Anura Kumara Dissanayake:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Anura Kumara Dissanayake was born on November 24, 1968, in Thambuththegama, Sri Lanka, into a working-class family. His father was a labourer, and his mother a housewife. Mr Dissanayake was involved in the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) party during his school years and was the first student from the college chosen for admission into the university.</li>
	<li>He studied at the University of Peradeniya before leaving due to threats during the political unrest of the 1987-1989 JVP insurrection. Mr Dissanayake later graduated from the University of Kelaniya with a degree in physical science in 1995.</li>
	<li>Mr Dissanayake rapidly rose through the ranks of the JVP. By 1995, he was appointed the National Organiser of the Socialist Students Association and joined the JVP's Central Working Committee. By 1998, he secured a position in the JVP's Politburo. This was significant as the JVP re-entered mainstream politics under Somawansa Amarasinghe, initially supporting President Chandrika Kumaratunga's government before eventually criticising it over various issues.</li>
	<li>In 2004, Mr Dissanayake was appointed as a cabinet minister in President Chandrika Kumaratunga's government. He handled portfolios like agriculture, livestock, land, and irrigation. A year later, Mr Dissanayake and other JVP ministers resigned in protest against a joint agreement between the Sri Lankan government and the LTTE for tsunami relief coordination.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Mr Dissanayake became the leader of the JVP in 2014, succeeding Somawansa Amarasinghe. He ran as the JVP's presidential candidate in 2019, securing third place with 3 per cent of the vote. He again announced his candidacy for the 2024 presidential elections under the banner of the National People's Power (NPP), a leftist coalition he built. He made a remarkable comeback, winning 42.31 per cent of the vote in the first round and 55.89 per cent in the second round.</li>
	<li>Anura Kumara Dissanayake was inaugurated as president on September 23. He is a Marxist politician who made history by becoming the country's first president from a third party. He has been a vocal critic of Sri Lanka's economic policies, particularly those that he views as necessary to the country's working class. He strongly opposed the IMF's conditions for a $2.9 billion bailout, advocating for a renegotiation of terms, tax reductions like the Pay-As-You-Earn tax, and the elimination of VAT on essential goods.</li>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As Saudi capital Riyadh gets ready to host the Conference of the Parties (COP16) of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD), Dr Osama Faqeeha, Deputy Minister of Environment, Water and Agriculture, has praised India's efforts on combating land degradation and drought.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dr Faqeeha, who is also an advisor to the UNCCD COP16 Presidency, in an email interview, mentioned the "success stories" from Rajasthan and Andhra Pradesh. "For instance, in Rajasthan's Lapodia village, the revival of traditional water harvesting systems has not only raised water tables but also regenerated degraded grasslands, inspiring over 50 neighbouring villages to adopt similar practices," he said.</p>

<p>Lapodia village today stands out like a green oasis in Rajasthan. This village, with a little over 300 households is just two hours from state capital Jaipur, transformed itself into a drought-proof village mostly through the revival of traditional water-harvesting structures.</p>

<p>Highlighting another Indian success story, Dr Faqeeha spoke about "the remarkable transformation achieved by Renuka Bio Farms in Andhra Pradesh's Tirupati district". "It shows how combining traditional wisdom with modern techniques can convert barren wetland into thriving agro-ecological systems".</p>

<p>&nbsp;"These stories demonstrate the transformative power of local initiatives in combating land degradation. These initiatives exemplify exactly what we hope to showcase and amplify at COP16 in Riyadh - practical, community-driven solutions that can be adapted and replicated globally," he said.</p>

<p>Highlighting similarities between Saudi and Indian desert region of Rajasthan, the Saudi minister emphasised &nbsp;on creating natural opportunities for collaboration and knowledge exchange.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The arid climate challenges we face in Saudi Arabia share many similarities with regions like Rajasthan. In Saudi Arabia we are focusing on utilizing renewable water resources, leveraging water conservation practices, and pursuing ambitious rural development programmes."<br />
&nbsp;<br />
"Successful initiatives like the Ghandivan project in Jaipur, which has transformed barren wasteland into a thriving ecosystem through community-driven efforts, offer valuable insights that can be adapted across different regions."<br />
&nbsp;<br />
He added that Riyadh will create platforms for sharing such experiences and best practices to benefit countries, regions, and the planet at COP16.</p>

<p>Speaking on the Saudi's primary goals for the presidency of COP16, Dr Faqeeha stated that the focused is on raising awareness of the impact of land degradation, drought, and desertification. "The scale of our challenge is stark: globally, we lose land equivalent to four football fields every second, amounting to 100 million hectares annually."</p>

<p>"COP16 in Riyadh represents a crucial turning point in our global response to land degradation and drought. By bringing together stakeholders from across sectors and generations, we will catalyse a new era of environmental action characterised by concrete commitments, innovative solutions, and meaningful collaboration."</p>

<p>The Conference of the Parties (COP16) of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) will take place in Riyadh from 2 to 13 December 2024.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Almost everyone in India is now vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, former chief scientist of the World Health Organisation Dr Soumya Swaminathan has said, underscoring the urgent need for cross-ministerial and international collaboration to address its effects on health, gender and economic stability in the country.</p>

<p>Swaminathan pointed to women and children as especially vulnerable to these climate-driven health risks.</p>

<p>In an interview with PTI on the sidelines of global climate talks COP29 here in Azerbaijan's capital, Swaminathan called for a concerted approach, saying, "practically everyone in India is now vulnerable to climate change impacts, from extreme heat to vector-borne diseases. Addressing this requires close cooperation."</p>

<p>"We know that climate change has disproportionate impacts on women and children," she explained, noting how women, particularly in rural areas, face increased health risks due to continued reliance on solid fuels for cooking.</p>

<p>She emphasised that "access to clean energy for everyone is a priority."</p>

<p>This, she argued, would not only reduce health risks associated with indoor air pollution but also lessen India's carbon footprint, marking a crucial step toward sustainable development.</p>

<p>Climate-related health risks in India are varied, ranging from immediate effects such as respiratory illnesses due to air pollution, to long-term issues like malnutrition stemming from disrupted agricultural cycles.</p>

<p>Swaminathan noted that more than 80 per cent of India's population is now exposed to these risks, emphasizing that "everybody is now vulnerable," from rural farmers to urban migrants.</p>

<p>She highlighted the specific challenges faced by the urban poor, especially migrants who live in peri-urban areas with inadequate housing and sanitation, which exposes them to greater risks during floods and extreme weather events.</p>

<p>With health as a central theme, Swaminathan stressed the benefits of green public transportation, an initiative she described as a "win-win solution."</p>

<p>"Carbon-neutral public transport will not only reduce air pollution but also promote physical activity and thereby improve health," she said, adding that reducing pollution would positively impact public health by curbing respiratory and cardiovascular diseases.</p>

<p>She also highlighted that India's urban centres are hotspots for these health issues due to dense populations and high pollution levels.</p>

<p>Swaminathan called for policies that integrate both health and climate objectives, stressing that this approach can drive development while building resilience against climate risks.</p>

<p>"If we do that kind of analysis, we can invest in actions that promote both development and reduce our carbon footprint," she noted, advocating for policies that prioritise "development with a climate-resilient focus."</p>

<p>Examples of such integrated actions include promoting clean cooking fuels, improving access to safe drinking water, and investing in infrastructure that can withstand extreme weather.</p>

<p>Dr Swaminathan went further to advocate for a gendered approach to climate policy, urging policymakers to "put a spotlight on women but also the poorest communities."</p>

<p>She argued that gender equity and social equity are essential to effective climate policy, explaining that "by taking a gendered perspective in all policies, we can ensure more inclusive and effective climate action."</p>

<p>Swaminathan called for greater research on climate impacts that are gender-specific, noting that this data would help policymakers create more targeted, meaningful interventions.</p>

<p>The economic costs of climate-driven health impacts are also severe.</p>

<p>Swaminathan pointed to recent studies indicating that climate-related air pollution alone costs the global economy trillions of dollars annually, affecting productivity, agriculture, and even tourism.</p>

<p>"If you look at the GDP loss and workplace productivity lost due to air pollution, it's enormous - in the trillions," she said. This, she argued, makes climate action not just a moral imperative but an economic necessity.</p>

<p>Addressing air pollution as a cross-border issue, Swaminathan noted that pollution does not recognise borders, making it crucial for India and other nations to engage in global collaborations.</p>

<p>"Air pollution today is the single largest risk factor to health," she said, adding "It's not a problem one country can solve on its own."</p>

<p>She referenced the Our Common Air (OCA) Commission, a global effort she is part of, which has been working with international bodies like WHO and UNEP to promote global standards and monitoring mechanisms for air quality.</p>

<p>"We need a system where every country has air quality monitors and updates its data, including on super pollutants like methane and black carbon," Swaminathan said, adding that these pollutants are highly dangerous yet often overlooked.</p>

<p>Swaminathan further explained the value of local data, which she argued would give a more accurate picture of pollution's impact on different regions of India.</p>

<p>"Policymakers want to see data from their own regions; it makes the issue real for them and helps design local solutions," she said.</p>

<p>Reflecting on the invisible nature of pollution's health impacts, Swaminathan commented, "When the air pollution is visible, people recognize it as a problem, but often it's invisible, and people become accustomed to it."</p>

<p>She stressed that while death rates from pollution-related illnesses are often discussed, policymakers should focus on the widespread chronic illnesses caused by poor air quality.</p>

<p>"It's not only about death - it's about chronic ill health that impacts quality of life and productivity," she said, pointing out that young children and the elderly are especially vulnerable.</p>

<p>For Swaminathan, tackling climate change is fundamentally linked to India's development goals.</p>

<p>"For us, development is still a key priority," she asserted. While India has made strides in increasing access to electricity and clean water, she stressed that much work remains, especially in rural areas where communities lack basic infrastructure.</p>

<p>Her vision for India's climate adaptation involves not only mitigating health risks but also ensuring that development initiatives - from housing to sanitation - are climate-resilient.</p>

<p>Swaminathan expressed optimism about India's potential to lead in climate adaptation through innovation, global cooperation, and commitment to sustainable development goals.</p>

<p>She pointed to Indian cities as potential leaders in air quality initiatives and green infrastructure, stating that "India can be a model for sustainable urbanization if we prioritize both development and environmental health."</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Aid Access, the leading supplier of abortion pills by mail in the US, received over 5,000 requests in less than 12 hours.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There's been a massive rise in the demand for abortion pills in the United States after Donald Trump's re-election to the White House. It stems from fears that under Trump 2.0, the country may face unprecedented restrictions as far as reproductive care is concerned.</p>

<p>Aid Access, the leading supplier of abortion pills by mail in the US, received over 5,000 requests in less than 12 hours. “I can see all the new requests ticking in as we're talking,” founder Rebecca&nbsp;Gomperts told <a href="http://https://amp.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/07/abortion-pills-hormones-trump " rel="nofollow,noindex">the Guardian</a>. “We've never seen this before.”</p>

<p>For Ms Gomperts, this wave of demand was not unexpected. Aid Access has established a streamlined system where physicians in abortion-legal states prescribe and ship pills to those in states with bans. Still, the sheer volume on Wednesday was huge. “We have an extremely streamlined process... but it's much more [than usual],” Ms Gomperts remarked.</p>

<p>Similar trends were observed across the country. Telehealth services like Wisp saw a 300 per cent increase in requests for emergency contraception, while Plan C, an abortion pill finder site, experienced a 625 per cent surge in traffic. “People are trying to plan for the reproductive apocalypse that we anticipate will be happening under a Trump presidency,” said Elisa Wells, co-founder of Plan C.</p>

<p>Women's health providers also experienced a dramatic rise in demand for emergency contraception. Wisp tripled its daily sales of Plan B by mid-morning Wednesday, with bulk orders increasing from 30 per cent of monthly sales to nearly 90 per cent in a single day. Similarly, Winx, another telehealth service, reported selling six times more doses of Plan B by Wednesday afternoon than in the previous week.</p>

<p>Transgender healthcare providers also faced a deluge of requests. Dr Crystal Beal, founder of QueerDoc, received an influx of inquiries from trans patients worried about access to hormone therapy. QueerDoc received more patient messages in one day than it typically would in a week. “Some of it is ‘How can I safeguard my access to medication?'” Ms Beal shared, citing concerns about the potential rollback of trans healthcare rights under Trump's administration. QueerDoc is now advising patients to stockpile hormone medications within the bounds of state laws and insurance limits.</p>

<p>Donald Trump's stance on abortion has oscillated, but his judicial appointments have consistently called for abortion restrictions, particularly in conservative states. Despite his campaign promise not to impose a nationwide abortion ban, experts say there are indirect ways his administration could restrict access.</p>

<p>A focus is likely on abortion pills, which accounted for 63 per cent of abortions in 2023. Measures could include stricter FDA rules requiring in-person dispensing or legal challenges under the 1873 Comstock Act, which could target pill distribution.</p>

<p>Although state-level decisions remain important, Trump's previous stance and actions, like appointing justices to overturn Roe v Wade, are&nbsp;a cause of concern.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

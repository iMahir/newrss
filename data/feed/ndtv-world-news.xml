       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A video of President-elect Donald Trump&nbsp;jokingly offering "millions" to buy a young black girl's hair during a golf outing, has gone viral on social media. While driving a cart while playing golf in West Palm Beach, Florida, Trump complimented a girl on her hair, saying, "Oh, I love that girl. I love that hair. I want her hair. Can I buy your hair? I'll pay you millions for that." &nbsp;She told the 78-year-old that she voted for him, and Trump playfully responded that he voted for her too.</p>

<p>He then invited the child, who he described as beautiful, to join him on his golf cart for a photo opportunity. The crowd was delighted by the moment, with one onlooker expressing amazement and noting that the girl would have a unique story to share - playing golf with the president.</p>

<p><strong>Here's the video:</strong></p>

<p></p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>The video has sparked mixed reactions. While some people appreciated his lighthearted and playful demeanour, others found the exchange to be unusual and weird. Some also called it racist. One user wrote, "This is so creepy and weird. A grown man yells out that he wants to buy a young girl's hair. That's weird, joking or not." Another said, "I can't take another 4 years of this."</p>

<p>Some also thought there was nothing wrong with the exchange.&nbsp;A third commented, "Imagine calling him racist when Trump is complimenting this beautiful young black girl's hair. This is why people love Trump. He's human just like the rest of us and has a heart.''</p>

<p>A fourth added, "Come on! People say that to kids to be nice! People overreacting! If it was someone else you would say that is cute and the girl has nice hair."</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US lumber prices, which already have risen in recent months due to lower production in Canada, could see further gains after President-elect Donald Trump's proposed tariffs on trade from north of the border.</p>

<p>Lumber futures in Chicago rose as much as 2.1% to $599 per 1,000 board feet Tuesday after the president-elect posted on social media that he would&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-25/trump-vows-to-hit-china-mexico-canada-with-tariffs-over-border" rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">impose</a>&nbsp;25% tariffs on all goods from Canada and Mexico unless those countries curb the flow of fentanyl and migrants into the US. Shares of forestry companies, including West Fraser Timber Co. and Interfor Corp., fell.</p>

<p>Canada, the biggest foreign supplier of lumber to the US, has faced a spate of sawmill closures amid higher US duties. The addition of tariffs would further threaten US lumber supplies as the nation seeks to rebuild in areas hit by hurricanes.</p>

<p>“What we've seen is that any of these sorts of duties or tariffs, they just end up causing supply to go down and prices to go up, and that impacts affordability of housing,” said Kurt Niquidet, chief economist of the BC Council of Forest Industries.&nbsp;</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-11/f3f03i6g_trump-tariffs_625x300_27_November_24.jpg?im=FitAndFill,algorithm=dnn,width=1200,height=738" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>The implementation of tariffs is more uncertain than duties, which are reassessed annually, but both would delve a financial blow to Canadian producers, Niquidet said.</p>

<p>In the US, tariffs “will further exacerbate our nation's ongoing housing affordability crisis,” Jim Tobin, president of the National Association of Home Builders, said in an emailed statement. The association had already been expecting price spikes over the next year as housing demand increases, he said.</p>

<p>While the US has become increasingly self-sufficient in its lumber production, it still relies on imports from Canada to meet domestic demand. And forests in the US South, the continent's biggest lumber production region, faced losses during the recent hurricane season.</p>

<p>Hurricane Helene in September damaged&nbsp;<a href="https://gatrees.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Hurricane-Helene-Timber-Impact-Assessment-Georgia-2024.pdf" rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">roughly 6%</a>&nbsp;of Georgia's forests, equating to about 1.47 million acres and $1.28 billion in losses, according to the Georgia Forestry Commission.&nbsp;</p>

</div>

<p>After hurricanes Helene and Milton, housing construction in the South&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-19/us-housing-starts-slide-3-1-as-hurricanes-impact-south-region" rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">dropped</a>&nbsp;in October as builders postponed projects, though single-family permit authorizations — a sign of future construction — rose to the fastest pace since April.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Rebuilding efforts in hurricane-affected areas are “slowly gaining momentum” and should support strong lumber sales in late December and early next year, said Crystal Gauvin, a senior economist at Forest Economic Advisors.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump's granddaughter, Kai, has offered a rare glimpse inside the US President-elect's private jet, Force One. In her latest YouTube vlog, the 17-year-old documented how she travelled to witness a SpaceX rocket launch alongside Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Ms Kai gave an intimate tour of the luxurious jet, featuring plush sofas, high-tech TVs, and a sleek, modern interior.</p>

<p>“Come along with me to SpaceX with Elon Musk for the sixth flight test of Starship!” she wrote to introduce the vlog. Next, she's seen boarding the plush aircraft alongside her friend.</p>

<p>Donald Trump's private jet, a Boeing 757, stands out for its customised interiors. Often referred to as the "Trump Force One," it has played a significant role in his campaigns and public image.</p>

<p>The Force One has seats embroidered with gold threads, lavatory fixtures, and other fittings. It also has plush leather seating and high-end wooden furnishings along with a state-of-the-art entertainment system with multiple screens.</p>

<p>There is a bedroom with a double bed and a dining area which seats four.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ms Kai also gave us a behind-the-scenes look at the cockpit. We also see a bobblehead at the centre. She recreated her grandfather's iconic YMCA dance moves and mimicked his well-known golf swing and signature hand gestures. Her enthusiasm continued as she explored the cockpit, describing the experience of seeing a plane land as "pretty cool stuff."</p>

<p>The vlog didn't just end on the jet. Ms Kai documented her journey to the SpaceX facility, capturing moments of her grandfather's conversation with Elon Musk about the rocket launch.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“I asked grandpa, ‘Would you go in it?',” said Ms Kai in the video. “And he goes, ‘No'. He would not volunteer to go in the spaceship but it's OK.”</p>

<p>Ms Kai laughed and then asked her friend if she would go. “Go on it? Without a doubt. In a heartbeat, I'm on that,” her friend said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Kai Trump described witnessing the rocket launch as "honestly one of the coolest things ever," despite the booster not returning to the launch pad and instead landing in the Gulf of Mexico. “I've never seen something like that,” she said with awe. “And the noise of it, when it was going up. Insane.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Donald Trump has appointed the SpaceX CEO to lead the newly established Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) alongside Vivek Ramaswamy.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Amid unrest in Bangladesh following the arrest of Hindu priest Chinmoy Krishna Das Brahmachari by Dhaka police, a Hindu temple was allegedly targeted by a mob in Chattogram. The arrest of former ISKCON leader Chinmoy Krishna Das has triggered protests across Bangladesh, with the community calling for the monk's release and justice for Hindus who have faced persecution since the ouster of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Loknath temple in Chittagong's Firingibazar was targeted in Chattogram, according to reports.</p>

<p>International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) spokesperson, Radharamn Das, shared a purported video of a mob attack on the temple on his X account and wrote, "24x7 attack on Hindus &amp; Hindu places of worship in #Bangladesh. When will it all STOP?"&nbsp;</p>

<p>He also tagged Prime Minister Narendra Modi, US President-elect Donald Trump, and his cabinet nominee Tulsi Gabbard, in the post.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Dhaka Reacts To India's Statement Over Monk's Arrest</strong></h2>

<p>Dhaka has reacted to India's statement condemning the arrest of Chinmoy Krishna Das Brahmachari and calling Bangladeshi authorities to ensure the safety and security of Hindus and all other minorities. In the issued by Bangladesh's foreign ministry, the Chief Adviser Prof Muhammad Yunus's government called the matter Dhaka's "internal affair" and said India's concerns are "unfounded" adding it "contrary to the spirit of friendship"</p>

<p>The Yunus administration later reaffirmed "in the strongest terms" that every Bangladeshi, regardless of their religious identity, has the "right to establish, maintain or perform respective religious rituals and practices or express views without hindrance."</p>

<h3><strong>Lawyer's Killing And Subsequent Arrests</strong></h3>

<p>The Bangladesh government also expressed "deep concerns" over the brutal killing of Advocate Saiful Islam Alif outside Chattogram court on Tuesday. "Authorities have stepped up security in the port city to ensure that religious harmony is maintained at any cost," read the statement.</p>

<p>Saiful, 35, an assistant public prosecutor, was hacked to death amid clashes between police and a crowd protesting the arrest of ISKCON leader Chinmoy Krishna Das in Bangladesh's port city of Chittagong. "Saiful Islam Alif, a lawyer, was killed in Chittagong," Nazim Uddin Chowdhury, President of Chittagong Bar Association, told news agency ANI over the phone.</p>

<p>Chief Adviser Yunus also condemned the murder of a lawyer and ordered an investigation into the killing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As per Bangladeshi media, law enforcement authorities have detained at least 20 people in raids in Chittagong in connection with the killing of the lawyer. Quoting Kotwali police station Officer-in-Charge Fazlul Kader, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/nation/366390/20-held-in-chittagong-over-lawyer-killing" rel="No Follow, No Index" target="_blank">Dhaka Tribune</a> reported that arrests were made during operations in Patharghata Mathar Potti, Andarkilla and Hazari Goli areas from Tuesday evening until midnight.</p>

<h3><strong>Unrest In Bangladesh</strong></h3>

<p>The law enforcement agencies are on high alert across Bangladesh amid tensions in Chittagong. The government has deployed extra forces in Chittagong and the capital Dhaka.</p>

<p>The unrest started after thousands of people in Chittagong gathered outside court premises demanding the release of Chinmoy Brahmachari. The protesters blocked the prison van after a court rejected his bail prayer and ordered to send him to jail. Police and other law-enforcing agencies fired tear shells and sound grenades to remove them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After two hours of clashes, Chinmoy Brahmachari was landed in jail, witnesses said.</p>

<h3><strong>About Chinmoy Krishna Das</strong></h3>

<p>Chandan Kumar Dhar Prokash alias Chinmoy Krishna Das Brahmachari is a spokesperson of the Sanatan Jagaran Mancha. He also heads an ISKCON-operated religious site named Pundarik Dham in Chittagong.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The monk was detained by the Detective Branch (DB) of the Dhaka Metropolitan Police at Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport on Monday and was arrested later on Sedation charges.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"A case has been filed against Chimnoy in charge of sedition, accusing him of hoisting a flag on the top of a stand of Bangladesh's national flag. But the man who filed the case, now he is not attached to the case. He is now disagreed to continue the case," a minority leader said.</p>

<p>Citing sources in ISKCON Chittagong, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/366367/who-is-chinmoy-krishna-and-why-is-he-being-charged" rel="No Follow, No Index" target="_blank">Dhaka Tribune</a> reported that Chinmoy Krishna hails from the port city's Satkania Upazila. He reportedly earned the nickname 'Shishu Bokta' due to his popularity as a religious preacher from an early age. He served as the Chittagong Divisional Secretary of ISKCON from 2016 to 2022 and has also been the Principal of Pundarik Dham in Hathazari, since 2007.</p>

<h3><strong>Violence Against Minorities In Bangladesh</strong></h3>

<p>Chinmoy Krishna Das's arrest came amid tensions over minority rights in the South Asian country that has seen widespread political violence since former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's ouster. Hindus comprise approximately 8 per cent of Bangladesh's 170 million people. Since the ouster of former PM Sheikh Hasina, the new military-backed interim government led by Mohammed Yunus has faced criticism for failing to curb a spike in violence against minorities.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>At least three temples - Lokonath Temple in Firangi Bazar, Mansa Mata Temple, and Kali Mata Temple in Hazari Lane - have been targeted in Chattogram in the past 24 hours, according to a report by <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.news18.com/world/temples-attacked-advocate-killed-as-hindu-monks-arrest-pushes-bangladesh-to-edge-top-points-9135421.html" rel="No Follow, No Index" target="_blank">News18</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Dhaka Reacts To India's Statement Over Monk's Arrest</strong></h2>

<p>Dhaka has reacted to India's statement condemning the arrest of Chinmoy Krishna Das Brahmachari and calling Bangladeshi authorities to ensure the safety and security of Hindus and all other minorities. In the issued by Bangladesh's foreign ministry, the Chief Adviser Prof Muhammad Yunus's government called the matter Dhaka's "internal affair" and said India's concerns are "unfounded" adding it "contrary to the spirit of friendship"</p>

<p>The Yunus administration later reaffirmed "in the strongest terms" that every Bangladeshi, regardless of their religious identity, has the "right to establish, maintain or perform respective religious rituals and practices or express views without hindrance."</p>

<h3><strong>Lawyer's Killing And Subsequent Arrests</strong></h3>

<p>The Bangladesh government also expressed "deep concerns" over the brutal killing of Advocate Saiful Islam Alif outside Chattogram court on Tuesday. "Authorities have stepped up security in the port city to ensure that religious harmony is maintained at any cost," read the statement.</p>

<p>Saiful, 35, an assistant public prosecutor, was hacked to death amid clashes between police and a crowd protesting the arrest of ISKCON leader Chinmoy Krishna Das in Bangladesh's port city of Chittagong. "Saiful Islam Alif, a lawyer, was killed in Chittagong," Nazim Uddin Chowdhury, President of Chittagong Bar Association, told news agency ANI over the phone.</p>

<p>Chief Adviser Yunus also condemned the murder of a lawyer and ordered an investigation into the killing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As per Bangladeshi media, law enforcement authorities have detained at least 20 people in raids in Chittagong in connection with the killing of the lawyer. Quoting Kotwali police station Officer-in-Charge Fazlul Kader, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/nation/366390/20-held-in-chittagong-over-lawyer-killing" rel="No Follow, No Index" target="_blank">Dhaka Tribune</a> reported that arrests were made during operations in Patharghata Mathar Potti, Andarkilla and Hazari Goli areas from Tuesday evening until midnight.</p>

<h3><strong>Unrest In Bangladesh</strong></h3>

<p>The law enforcement agencies are on high alert across Bangladesh amid tensions in Chittagong. The government has deployed extra forces in Chittagong and the capital Dhaka.</p>

<p>The unrest started after thousands of people in Chittagong gathered outside court premises demanding the release of Chinmoy Brahmachari. The protesters blocked the prison van after a court rejected his bail prayer and ordered to send him to jail. Police and other law-enforcing agencies fired tear shells and sound grenades to remove them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After two hours of clashes, Chinmoy Brahmachari was landed in jail, witnesses said.</p>

<h3><strong>About Chinmoy Krishna Das</strong></h3>

<p>Chandan Kumar Dhar Prokash alias Chinmoy Krishna Das Brahmachari is a spokesperson of the Sanatan Jagaran Mancha. He also heads an ISKCON-operated religious site named Pundarik Dham in Chittagong.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The monk was detained by the Detective Branch (DB) of the Dhaka Metropolitan Police at Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport on Monday and was arrested later on Sedation charges.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"A case has been filed against Chimnoy in charge of sedition, accusing him of hoisting a flag on the top of a stand of Bangladesh's national flag. But the man who filed the case, now he is not attached to the case. He is now disagreed to continue the case," a minority leader said.</p>

<p>Citing sources in ISKCON Chittagong, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/366367/who-is-chinmoy-krishna-and-why-is-he-being-charged" rel="No Follow, No Index" target="_blank">Dhaka Tribune</a> reported that Chinmoy Krishna hails from the port city's Satkania Upazila. He reportedly earned the nickname 'Shishu Bokta' due to his popularity as a religious preacher from an early age. He served as the Chittagong Divisional Secretary of ISKCON from 2016 to 2022 and has also been the Principal of Pundarik Dham in Hathazari, since 2007.</p>

<h3><strong>Violence Against Minorities In Bangladesh</strong></h3>

<p>Chinmoy Krishna Das's arrest came amid tensions over minority rights in the South Asian country that has seen widespread political violence since former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's ouster. Hindus comprise approximately 8 per cent of Bangladesh's 170 million people. Since the ouster of former PM Sheikh Hasina, the new military-backed interim government led by Mohammed Yunus has faced criticism for failing to curb a spike in violence against minorities.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The coming year will put incoming US President Donald Trump's geopolitical strategies to the test, as wars rage in the Middle East and Ukraine and tensions rise in Asia.</p>

<p>Here are some of the big foreign policy hotspots facing him and other world leaders in 2025.</p>

<h2><strong>Middle East</strong></h2>

<p>More than a year on from the Hamas attacks of October 7, 2023, the Middle East risks tipping into regional conflict. Israel is pursuing its deadly retaliatory offensive in Gaza while also battling another armed group, Iran-backed Hezbollah, in Lebanon.</p>

<p>Trump has nominated a staunch pro-Israel politician, Mike Huckabee, as his ambassador to Israel.</p>

<p>Michael Horowitz, an analyst at consultancy Le Beck International, said Trump has pledged to "end wars" but does not look inclined to set conditions for Israel.</p>

<p>"The conflict in Gaza could really enter a state of limbo, with Israel imposing a new military solution that keeps troops inside the Strip and declaring that the conflict has ended -- without even the beginning of a political solution," he told AFP.</p>

<p>Horowitz judged a ceasefire in Lebanon more likely, as Israel has achieved "a lot of its objectives", having bombarded Hezbollah and killed several of its leaders.</p>

<h2><strong>Ukraine</strong></h2>

<p>Ukraine is struggling to fight off the invasion launched by Russia in February 2022. Kyiv is short of soldiers and depends on Western military aid, while Russia is advancing in Ukraine's east and has been bolstered by troops from its ally North Korea.</p>

<p>The Republicans' election victory has raised the prospect of a halt to US military aid to Ukraine after party representatives held up a package for nearly a year.</p>

<p>Moscow is pushing for Kyiv to negotiate a settlement.</p>

<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on November 16 that Kyiv would like to end the war next year through "diplomatic means".</p>

<p>But Russia has demanded Kyiv surrender four regions as a precondition for talks, which Ukraine has rejected.</p>

<p>Trump said during his election campaign that he could end the war "in 24 hours".</p>

<p>His nominee for US national security advisor, Mike Waltz, on November 24 called for negotiations.</p>

<p>"We need to restore deterrence, restore peace, and get ahead of this escalation ladder, rather than responding to it," he said.</p>

<h2><strong>North Korea</strong></h2>

<p>Pyongyang has carried out numerous ballistic missile tests in 2024. Tensions have risen between it and South Korea. The North also has strengthened its ties with Moscow.</p>

<p>The two countries signed a mutual defence treaty in June and North Korea sent 10,000 soldiers to aid Moscow's fight against Ukraine.</p>

<p>"In return, North Korea will seek military technology from Moscow -- everything from drone defence systems to ballistic missiles," said Fyodor Tertiskiy, a senior research fellow with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a US-based think tank.</p>

<p>"These moves signal that we should be prepared for actions from North Korea that we haven't seen before."</p>

<p>Andrew Yeo, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, another US think tank, meanwhile pointed to growing tensions between North and South Korea.</p>

<p>Pyongyang recently blew up roads and railways between the two states and accused the South of sending drones into the North.</p>

<p>If Russia further boosts North Korea militarily, "the United States and its allies in Europe and Asia will need to prepare for a new phase of greater instability and possible escalation in northeast Asia," said Yeo.</p>

<h2><strong>Taiwan, China</strong></h2>

<p>Elsewhere in Asia, Taiwan remains a potential flashpoint for global conflict. China claims the island as part of its territory and has said it would never rule out taking it by force.</p>

<p>The United States is Taiwan's most important backer and biggest supplier of weapons, but like most other countries it does not have official diplomatic relations with the island.</p>

<p>Trump has named China hawk Marco Rubio to be his secretary of state, heralding tensions with Beijing.</p>

<p>Waltz meanwhile has declared that the United States is in "a Cold War with the Chinese Communist Party".</p>

<p>He has said the United States must learn from the experience of Ukraine's war with Russia by backing Taiwan in the face of China.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[US President Joe Biden has hailed the Lebanon ceasefire as a win, but his legacy is likely to remain overshadowed by Donald Trump's impending return and the failure to achieve peace in Gaza.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden has hailed the Lebanon ceasefire as a win, but his legacy is likely to remain overshadowed by Donald Trump's impending return and the failure to achieve peace in Gaza.</p>

<p>In a rare moment to savor in the lame-duck phase of his presidency, the 82-year-old spoke in the Rose Garden of the White House to announce the truce deal between Israel and Hezbollah.</p>

<p>Biden said the deal was "good news" and "brings us closer to realizing the affirmative agenda that I'm pushing forward during my entire presidency, a vision for the future of the Middle East."</p>

<p>He added that "in our remaining time in office I'll work tirelessly" to achieve it.</p>

<p>The ceasefire at least puts on hold one of the grinding wars that the Trump administration will inherit from Biden's White House on January 20, along with Gaza and Ukraine.</p>

<p>But the Lebanon deal is "lipstick on a pig," said Colin Clarke, director of research at the Soufan Group.</p>

<p>"Of course he's going to claim this as a win -- he's got nothing else to point to," Clarke told AFP. Biden was "whitewashing what has been a fairly disastrous approach to the region post-October 7."</p>

<p>Clarke was referring to Biden's strong support of Israel following the brutal attack by Hamas that triggered the war in Gaza and more than a year of cross-border fire and two months of all-out war in Lebanon.</p>

<p>US presidents famously have an eye on the way they will be judged by history and Biden is no exception.</p>

<p>But despite announcing a fresh push for an end to Israel's war in Gaza, Biden's dream of securing wider peace before he leaves office remains far off.</p>

<p>It reflects the wider sense that Biden's legacy will be a tarnished one.</p>

<p>When he took office he said he wanted to "save the soul of America" and show the world that "America is back" after Trump's turbulent first presidency.</p>

<p>But pride made him resist growing concerns about his age and mental acuity until a disastrous debate against Trump forced him to drop his bid for a second term in July.</p>

<p>Trump then comprehensively defeated his chosen successor, Vice President Kamala Harris, on November 5.</p>

<p><strong>'Trump's problem'</strong></p>

<p>Since the election Biden has spent much time trying to "Trump-proof" what he regards as his main foreign policy achievements.</p>

<p>Nowhere is that truer than on US support for Ukraine.</p>

<p>In the past two weeks the once-cautious Biden has given Ukraine the green light to use US-supplied missiles against targets in Russia and ordered landmines to be sent to Ukraine.</p>

<p>Tensions have since soared with Moscow. Trump had previously promised to secure a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia within 24 hours but has yet to unveil his administration's policy.</p>

<p>Biden also embarked on a last-minute diplomatic tour of South America during which he tried to reassure unsettled US allies -- and adversary China -- that the transition to a Trump presidency would be smooth.</p>

<p>The Lebanon deal is a further example of his attempts to shore up his legacy -- but the failure to end the grinding war in Gaza hangs heavy over him.</p>

<p>"I do not expect a victory lap. This is only one of three fronts and arguably not the most important," Garrett Martin of American University told AFP.</p>

<p>"It reinforces the sentiment of great frustration that the Biden administration has been trying to deal with."</p>

<p>Biden's frustrations in dealing with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have spilled into the open over the 13 months of the Gaza war, as the Israeli has resisted US chiding over the civilian death toll.</p>

<p>For his part, Netanyahu threw some shade Biden's way on Tuesday -- and looked ahead to a Trump administration that he hopes will give Israel freer rein.</p>

<p>"It is no secret that there have been big delays in weapons and munitions deliveries. These delays will be resolved soon," Netanyahu said in a televised address announcing the deal on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Still, Trump, despite being a man who famously likes the art of the deal, may find the Middle East as troublesome as Biden.</p>

<p>"Legacies can be shared. Now it's going to be Trump's problem," said Martin.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Walmart has scaled back its diversity initiatives, including removing LGBTQ products from its website and closing a nonprofit that supported minority programs.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Walmart has decided to stop some programs that support diversity. This includes removing products related to the LGBTQ+ community from its website and ending a non-profit organisation that helped minority groups. This step aligns with a broader corporate trend of reducing diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs.</p>

<p>According to<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/26/walmart-pulls-back-on-dei-efforts-removes-some-lbgtq-merchandise-.html"><em> CNBC,</em></a> the largest employer in the US, which has about 1.6 million workers, joined a growing list of companies that have stepped back from diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts after feeling the heat from conservative activists. Some have also attributed changes to the US Supreme Court's decision last year that struck down affirmative action programs at colleges.</p>

<p>This step aligns with a broader corporate trend of reducing diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs. Other companies like Tractor Supply, Lowe's, Ford, Molson Coors, Bud Light, and Target have also walked back some of their equity and inclusion policies in recent months.</p>

In a statement, Walmart said it is "willing to change alongside our associates and customers who represent all of America."</p>

<p>"We've been on a journey and know we aren't perfect, but every decision comes from a place of wanting to foster a sense of belonging, to open doors to opportunities for all our associates, customers, and suppliers, and to be a Walmart for everyone," the statement said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Trump's transition team is now readying an announcement of Jamieson Greer as US Trade Representative, people familiar with the matter said.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump fired an opening shot in his tariff battle with Beijing by promising an additional 10 per cent levy on Chinese goods. The question that now confronts President Xi Jinping is how much more is coming.</p>

<p>The threat by the US president-elect, made on his Truth Social network on Monday, was in retribution for what he said was China's failure to stop "drugs pouring into our Country, mostly through Mexico." It wasn't clear from the post whether the 10 per cent tariff level was an additional levy to an earlier warning of 60 per cent or represented a climbdown.</p>

<p>"This is an early test of Xi's willingness to play ball with the new Trump administration," said Neil Thomas, a fellow for Chinese politics at the Asia Society Policy Institute's Center for China Analysis. "Agreeing to Trump's demands could avoid a painful tariff, but might encourage him to impose more tariffs to try and extract more concessions."</p>

<p>Trump's gambit risks setting in motion a standoff between the world's two biggest economies following an election campaign that already brought fears over a new wave of protectionism to the forefront. In related posts, Trump said he'd slap 25 per cent tariffs on all products from Mexico and Canada, citing concerns over illegal immigration and the flow of drugs like fentanyl.</p>

<p>Trump's transition team is now readying an announcement of Jamieson Greer as US Trade Representative, people familiar with the matter said, which would put in place a veteran negotiator who has called countering China's trade policies a "generational challenge" for the US.</p>

<p>China responded on Tuesday by defending its track record and refrained from mentioning any planned retaliation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While calling fentanyl the "US's problem," the Foreign Ministry praised the achievements of counter-narcotics cooperation between the two countries, saying in a statement that China has provided support to fight the trafficking.</p>

<p>"China is willing to continue anti-drug cooperation with the US on basis of equality, mutual benefit and mutual respect," it said. "The US should cherish China's goodwill and maintain the hard-won good situation of China-US anti-drug cooperation."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Liu Pengyu, spokesman for the Chinese embassy in the US, earlier said Beijing had informed Washington of the progress made in counter-narcotics efforts and described as "mutually beneficial" economic and trade cooperation between both countries. "No one will win a trade war or a tariff war," he wrote on X.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What Next</strong></p>

<p>The biggest uncertainty now centers on whether Beijing would reprise a playbook used during the first trade war started by Trump, when Xi's government initially embraced a strategy of "strategic composure" that sought to avoid escalating disputes and generally waited for the US to act before any retaliation.</p>

<p>Later, it switched gears by adopting a more aggressive style of conducting international relations referred to as "Wolf Warrior Diplomacy" - an approach it's since backed away from.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Howells is suing Newport City Council for Rs 4,900 crore (495 million pounds), accusing them of blocking access to the landfill.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A woman has reportedly admitted to accidentally discarding the hard drive containing access to her ex-boyfriend James Howells' lost Bitcoin fortune- now worth an astonishing Rs 5,900 crore (569 million pounds). &nbsp;</p>

<p>Halfina Eddy-Evans, the mother of Howells' two teenage sons, told <em>Daily Mail </em>that nearly a decade ago, she took the hard drive to a landfill in Newport, Wales, as part of a cleanup at Howells' request. "Yes, I threw away his rubbish. He asked me to," she explained. "I had no idea what was inside. Losing it wasn't my fault." &nbsp;</p>

<p>Howells mined 8,000 Bitcoins in 2009 but forgot about them until years later, when he realized the hard drive, containing the digital key to his cryptocurrency fortune, had been lost. Now buried under 100,000 tonnes of waste in a Newport landfill, the hard drive remains inaccessible despite its growing value. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Howells is suing Newport City Council for Rs 4,900 crore (495 million pounds), accusing them of blocking access to the landfill. "This treasure hunt isn't going away," Howells told <em>Fortune</em>. "The value grows every day." &nbsp;</p>

<p>However, the council has repeatedly denied his requests to excavate, citing environmental concerns and permit limitations. A spokesperson stated, "Excavation is not possible under our environmental permit, and such work would have a huge negative impact on the area." &nbsp;</p>

<p>Eddy-Evans insists she wants no part of the fortune if it's recovered. "I hope he finds it, not that I want a penny. I just want him to stop talking about it," she said, adding that the situation has taken a toll on Howells' mental health. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Howells has pledged to donate 10% of the fortune to transform Newport into "the Dubai or Las Vegas of the UK" if the hard drive is recovered. For now, his legal battle continues, with a hearing scheduled for early December. &nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A guitar company touting an endorsement by Donald Trump has become embroiled in a trademark dispute, accused of imitating an iconic instrument, US media reported Tuesday.</p>

<p>Trump Guitars, whose website boasts a picture of the US president-elect holding a six-string, has received a "cease and desist" letter from Gibson, whose guitars have been favorites of musicians including Bob Dylan and Chuck Berry.</p>

<p>The letter warns Trump Guitars owner 16 Creative that the design of their product "infringes upon Gibson's exclusive trademarks, particularly the iconic Les Paul body shape," US outlets said.</p>

<p>Trump Guitars, which says on its website it has "the ONLY guitar endorsed" by the incoming commander-in-chief has already sold out of its Trump-autographed American Eagle electric guitar, which had a price tag of $11,500.</p>

<p>The company is also offering a "Presidential Series" in red, gold or black, whose shape bears a striking resemblance to the Les Paul, but which has "DONALD J. TRUMP" inlaid on the fretboard.</p>

<p>However, the site notes: "The images shown are for illustration purposes only and may not be an exact representation of the product."</p>

<p>The website also offers a disclaimer that it is not in any way affiliated to Gibson Brands Inc.</p>

<p>The guitars, the site notes, are "manufactured by multiple providers and include parts/features that are both domestic and international."</p>

<p>It was not immediately clear if they would be affected by a proposed 25 percent blanket tariff the incoming president says he intends to impose on products shipped from Mexico or Canada.</p>

<p>Trump is not shy about putting his name to an array of products unrelated to his core real estate empire.</p>

<p>The businessman-turned-politician has sold his supporters everything from $100,000 watches to limited edition coins, to gold sneakers, to digital trading cards and signed bibles.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>George Stubbs' popular painting of a Spanish pointer dog will go under the hammer at Sotheby London next week, 52 years after it was last auctioned. The 18th-century portrait is likely to fetch somewhere between 1,500,000-2,000,000 pounds, according to a <a href="http://https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/26/style/george-stubbs-spanish-pointer-auction-intl-scli/index.html" rel="nofollow noindex" target="_blank">CNN</a> report. The iconic painting was last sold for 30,000 pounds ($37,700) at the 1972 auction and 11 pounds ($14) at the 1802 auction.</p>

<p>According to Sotheby's, “The Spanish Pointer” is believed to have been painted between 1766 and 1768 and is considered one of the most famous pieces of work by Stubbs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“It is always very exciting when a painting of this calibre re-emerges after being ‘lost,'” said Julian Gascoigne, a senior director and British paintings specialist at Sotheby's.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The pointer dog breed shown in the painting was brought to England from Spain at the beginning of the eighteenth century. Sportsmen valued the canines for their hunting prowess and obedience.</p>

<p>The massive bones at the back of the head and the broad nostrils are two of the animal's distinctive features that Stubbs depicts in this piece of art.</p>

<p>“It demonstrates his versatility and innate understanding of animal anatomy of all species,” said Gascoigne.<br />
<br />
Since it was first painted, Stubbs's The Spanish Pointer has only had one official exhibition, in 1948 at the National Gallery of Sports and Pastimes in London. It was not available for public viewing again until 1972 when it was sold at Sotheby's.<br />
<br />
A largely self-taught artist completed fewer than 400 paintings in his career. Stubbs' talent made him well-known for his portrayals of animals, especially horses. His training in anatomy helped him do justice to his artwork.<br />
<br />
In addition to his works in the Tate Britain collection of ancient British art, his painting "Whistlejacket," which depicts a racehorse, is on display in London's National Gallery.<br />
<br />
"The Spanish Pointer" will be displayed at Sotheby's exhibition of 19th-century and old master paintings until early December.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former rugby union player James Haskell, who has been best friends with Prince Harry for a long time, has labelled the British royal family "very dysfunctional", adding, some of the members "aren't as great as others."</p>

<p>Mr Haskell opened up about his bond with Harry and his family in an interview with <a href="https://www.thetimes.com/magazines/the-times-magazine/article/james-haskell-royals-rugby-interview-p6fhqzcbh?t=1732610047176" rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">the London Times</a> and said he has spent a lot of time with them over the past several years.</p>

<p>"They do amazing work — but they're also a modern family that's very dysfunctional," Mr Haskell said.</p>

<p>He said he was in attendance when Harry got married to Meghan Markle, adding he was even a part of "Mike and Zara's wedding."</p>

<p>Despite criticising some of them, the 39-year-old defended the monarchy, saying they “serve an important role”.</p>

<p>"To those who want to get rid of the monarchy — once they're gone, they're gone. There's no way back from that, so remember they serve an important role. I love what they do," he added.</p>

<p>In the last few years, all has not been well between the royal family and Prince Harry and Meghan, particularly after the Duke and Duchess of Sussex moved out of the family. It got no better after Harry opened up about his issues with his father and brother in his memoir, <em>Spare</em>.</p>

<p>Earlier, a source close to the family told People magazine that although the rift between Prince Harry and his brother Prince William was “very bad,” it wasn't “irreparable.”</p>

<p>Harry visited his homeland last month but did not see either his father or brother during the trip.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Haskell continues to share a special connection with the royal family as he hosts “The Good, the Bad &amp; the Rugby” podcast along with Alex Payne and Mike Tindall, who is married to Zara Phillips, daughter of Princess Anne.</p>

<p>The Tindalls are said to be close to both Prince William and his wife Kate Middleton and Harry's family.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Romance scams – where scammers create fake identities and use dating or friendship to get your trust and money –&nbsp;<a href="https://www.accc.gov.au/about-us/publications/serial-publications/targeting-scams-reports-on-scams-activity/targeting-scams-report-of-the-accc-on-scams-activity-2023">cost Australians</a>&nbsp;A$201 million last year.</p>

<p>But the emotional impact of romance scams can often feel worse than losing money. Those who have been scammed may experience shame and embarrassment and have difficulty accepting the relationship wasn't real.</p>

<p>People who have acquired a brain injury, for example after a stroke or car accident, may be more vulnerable to these scams.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09602011.2021.2016447?journalCode=pnrh20">My research with colleagues</a>&nbsp;shows they are often less aware of scams and find it harder to recognise red flags.</p>

<p>But our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/eprint/F5AFEDMNVNCQSMUDBMQ2/full?target=10.1080/09638288.2022.2139418">project</a>&nbsp;has found there are benefits when people with brain injuries who have been scammed share their experiences. It can create awareness, reduce stigma and help prevent future scams.</p>

<h2>Some groups are more vulnerable</h2>

<p>Anyone can be scammed. But&nbsp;<a href="https://www.accc.gov.au/about-us/publications/serial-publications/targeting-scams-reports-on-scams-activity/targeting-scams-report-of-the-accc-on-scams-activity-2023">some groups are more at risk</a>, including people with a disability such as an acquired brain injury.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/brain-impairment/article/do-we-need-to-know-about-cyberscams-in-neurorehabilitation-a-crosssectional-scoping-survey-of-australasian-clinicians-and-service-providers/D2572ABFB991DC974FB7E489B8CA11D1#">We surveyed</a>&nbsp;101 clinicians in Australia and New Zealand who work with people who have acquired brain injuries. More than half (53%) had a client who had been affected by a cyberscam. The most common type was a romance scam.</p>

<h2>How do romance scams work?</h2>

<p>Romance scams involve a scammer (or sometimes multiple people) luring someone into a fake relationship in order to exploit them, often to get money. Scammers may use online dating platforms to connect, or social media, gaming and even online shopping sites.</p>

<p>Romance scammers build trust and strong emotions using techniques such as love bombing (early and frequent declarations of affection), grooming and manipulation over an extended period of time. They share common interests and even similar types of trauma to make people trust them. As a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09602011.2021.2016447?journalCode=pnrh20">romance scam survivor</a>&nbsp;with an acquired brain injury explained:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My way of thinking was sort of skewed because all I seen was love, the money, all the things I wanted, so I didn't worry about all the other little stuff.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The identity of the scammer usually appears very attractive and trustworthy but is often fake, stolen from a real person or&nbsp;<a href="https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/">AI-generated</a>. They present lots of evidence and exciting details about their everyday life to appear real and keep people hooked into the relationship.</p>

<p><a href="https://socialcatfish.com/scamfish/how-we-got-a-hold-of-a-romance-scammers-playbook/">Scammers use pre-written scripts</a>&nbsp;with compelling narratives describing significant financial success, being a widower or orphan, or working overseas to attract people. Flirty language and flattery makes people want to keep communicating with the scammer. They might tell you they think you have a beautiful smile and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.smh.com.au/national/hello-amazingness-leaked-romance-scammers-scripts-20190417-p51ezu.html">their dog or cat would love you</a>.</p>

<p>Scammers will invest weeks and months to build up a connection, then scammers present exciting “opportunities”. These may include investments and requests to cover international flights for a first meet-up. Or paying for medical bills for a sick relative. As a scam survivor with an acquired brain injury&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09602011.2021.2016447?journalCode=pnrh20">explained</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>She was really jumping into a kind of quite intimate relationship with me, even though we haven't met yet, but she's promising we will one day. All I need to do is send money.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Why are people with brain injuries more at risk?</h2>

<p>One in 45 Australians&nbsp;<a href="https://www.aihw.gov.au/getmedia/1f719b27-6b93-434a-b0e6-997b4ead061a/bulletin55.pdf">lives with</a>&nbsp;a brain injury acquired during an event such as car accident or stroke. This can damage a specific part of the brain, widespread brain cells (neurons), or both.</p>

<p><a href="https://synapse.org.au/fact-sheet/what-is-brain-injury/">The impact of a brain injury</a>&nbsp;varies but can affect cognition, emotions, behaviour and neurological functioning. As a result, people can experience changes in their ability to care for themselves, work, socialise and make complex decisions.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.jmir.org/2024/1/e51245">Cognitive difficulties</a>&nbsp;– such as memory problems and reduced information processing – can make it harder to learn, notice and respond to scam red flags in real time. People may struggle to comprehend new or complex information, have reduced judgement and be more impulsive.</p>

<p>Like other vulnerable Australians, people with brain injury may also be&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09602011.2021.2016447?journalCode=pnrh20">bored, lonely and require care</a>. This may mean the scammers' constant online availability, messaging, attention, praise and acceptance of the person regardless of their disability is even more attractive.</p>

<h2>Shame and embarrassment</h2>

<p>People with acquired brain injuries may also struggle to move from knowing or intending to do something, to actually enacting that behaviour. This is called the&nbsp;<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9353325/#:%7E:text=The%20%E2%80%9Cfrontal%20lobe%20paradox%E2%80%9D%20(,and%20test%20settings%20(3).)">frontal lobe paradox</a>. As one of our interviewees&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09602011.2021.2016447?journalCode=pnrh20">explained</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I make some big realisations and then I forget about it, like … ‘don't do that again'. And then I go and do it again.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When the scam is uncovered, family, friends and frontline services such as police and banks may respond with blame, judgement and ridicule. This&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09602011.2021.2016447?journalCode=pnrh20">contributes</a>&nbsp;to further distress:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They just say how stupid I was for being conned.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Scams are likely under-reported to authorities such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.scamwatch.gov.au/">Scamwatch</a>&nbsp;as a result of shame and a lack of awareness about scams.</p>

<p>Family and clinicians of people with brain injury may&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/brain-impairment/article/do-we-need-to-know-about-cyberscams-in-neurorehabilitation-a-crosssectional-scoping-survey-of-australasian-clinicians-and-service-providers/D2572ABFB991DC974FB7E489B8CA11D1">cut or reduce their access to money or the internet</a>, which adds to the scam's financial and emotional impacts.</p>

<p>As one&nbsp;<a href="https://www.jmir.org/2024/1/e51245">clinician explained</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The depression […] didn't come from being scammed. It came from quite the opposite, almost like he […] feels like it's his right to have access and leave himself open to those things.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Authentic partnerships with people with lived experience</h2>

<p>Our research team has developed a suite of tailored resources called&nbsp;<a href="https://cyberability.org.au/">CyberAbility</a>, which were co-designed with people who have brain injuries and experience of being scammed. We call them “<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/eprint/F5AFEDMNVNCQSMUDBMQ2/full?target=10.1080/09638288.2022.2139418">Scambassadors</a>”.</p>

<p>The Scambassadors alleviate some of the stigma and shame associated with being scammed, through conducting community education sessions, speaking with media, and co-facilitating therapy groups. They also spread awareness to other people with brain injuries about what to look out for – but the advice is helpful for everyone.</p>

<p>You can look out for signs someone in your life is being scammed. This could include a new unmet lover, major unexpected purchases or loans, or an increase in secrecy about online activities.</p>

<p>Approach difficult conversations about possible scams with curiosity, care and patience. Share your own experiences of being scammed or ripped off to normalise this and reduce judgement.</p>

<p>Whoever is scammed, the real fault lies with the criminals who commit this fraud. But regularly discussing scams can help reduce stigma and protect our community.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gunshots, screams, eerie laughter: South Korea's border island Ganghwa is being bombarded nightly with blood-curdling sounds, part of a new campaign by the nuclear-armed North that is driving residents to despair.</p>

<p>Before it started, 56-year-old Kim Yun-suk fell asleep to the hum of insects and woke to the chirping of birds. Now, she is kept awake every night by what sounds like the soundtrack of a low-budget horror movie at top volume.</p>

<p>"The peaceful sounds of nature... have now been drowned out," Kim told AFP.</p>

<p>"All we hear is this noise."</p>

<p>The campaign is the latest manifestation of steadily declining ties between the two Koreas this year, which have also seen Pyongyang test ever more powerful missiles and bombard the South with trash-carrying balloons.</p>

<p>Since July, North Korea has been broadcasting the noises for huge chunks of almost every day from loudspeakers along the border.</p>

<p>The northern point of Ganghwa -- an island in the Han river estuary on the Yellow Sea -- is only about two kilometres (a mile) from the North.</p>

<p>When AFP visited, the nighttime broadcast included what sounded like the screams of people dying on the battlefield, the crack of gunfire, bombs exploding, along with chilling music that started at 11:00 pm.</p>

<p>In the almost pitch-black fields, sinister noises echoed as the stars in the clear night sky shone beautifully alongside the coastal road lights, creating a stark and unsettling contrast.</p>

<p>North Korea has done propaganda broadcasts before, said 66-year-old villager Ahn Hyo-cheol, but they used to focus on criticising the South's leaders, or idealising the North.</p>

<p>Now "there were sounds like a wolf howling, and ghostly sounds", he said.</p>

<p>"It feels unpleasant and gives me chills. It really feels bizarre."</p>

<p>Ganghwa county councillor Park Heung-yeol said the new broadcasts were "not just regime propaganda -- it's genuinely intended to torment people".</p>

<p><strong>Torture</strong></p>

<p>Experts said the new broadcasts almost meet the criteria for a torture campaign.</p>

<p>"Almost every regime has used noise torture and sleep deprivation," Rory Cox, a historian at the University of St Andrews, told AFP.</p>

<p>"It is very common and leaves no physical scarring, therefore making it deniable."</p>

<p>Exposure to noise levels above 60 decibels at night increases the risk of sleep disorders, experts said, but AFP tracked levels of up to 80 decibels late at night on Ganghwa during a recent trip.</p>

<p>"I find myself taking headache medicine almost all the time," An Mi-hee, 37, told AFP, adding that prolonged sleep deprivation due to the noise has also led to anxiety, eye pain, facial tremors and drowsiness.</p>

<p>"Our kids can't sleep either, so they've developed mouth sores and are dozing off at school."</p>

<p>Distraught and desperate, An travelled to Seoul and got on her knees to beg lawmakers at the National Assembly to find a solution, breaking down in tears as she described the island's suffering.</p>

<p>"It would actually be better if there were a flood, a fire, or even an earthquake, because those events have a clear recovery timeline," An said.</p>

<p>"We have no idea if this will go on until the person in North Korea who gives the orders dies, or if it could be cut off at any moment. We just don't know."</p>

<p><strong>'70s horror flick'</strong></p>

<p>The noise tormenting Ganghwa island residents appeared to be a rudimentary mix of clips from a sound library, typically common at any TV or radio broadcasters, audio experts told AFP.</p>

<p>The sound effects are "like something found in a South Korean horror film in the 70s and 80s," said sound engineer Hwang Kwon-ik.</p>

<p>The two Koreas remain technically at war since the 1950 to 1953 conflict ended in an armistice not a peace treaty.</p>

<p>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un this year declared Seoul his "principal enemy" and has ramped up weapons testing and built closer military ties with Russia.</p>

<p>The isolated and impoverished North is known to be extremely sensitive about its citizens gaining access to South Korean pop culture.</p>

<p>Some experts have suggested the latest broadcasts could be aimed at preventing North Korean soldiers from hearing the South's own propaganda broadcasts, which typically feature K-pop songs and international news.</p>

<p>In August, just weeks after South Korea resumed K-pop broadcasts in response to Pyongyang floating trash-carrying balloons south, a North Korean soldier defected by crossing the heavily fortified border on foot.</p>

<p>But Lee Su-yong, an audio production professor at the Dong-Ah Institute of Media and Arts, said: "If there is sound coming towards the North that you want to mask, then the sound (you use to cover it) must also be directed toward the North."</p>

<p>"It seems less about masking noise and more about inflicting pain on people in the South," he told AFP.</p>

<p>Choi Hyoung-chan, a 60-year-old resident, said the South Korean government had failed to protect vulnerable civilians on the frontier.</p>

<p>"They should come here and try to live with these sounds for just ten days," he told AFP, referring to officials in Seoul.</p>

<p>"I doubt they could even endure a single day."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An Indian-origin investment banker's claim that he makes over Rs 3 crore in London has stunned many on social media. He said he had eight years of experience in the field and earned over 300,000 pounds annually. The banker did not disclose his actual income to the viewers.</p>

<p>Piyush Monga, an Indian-origin digital creator who runs the 'Salary Scale' page on Instagram, shared a video of his interaction with the investment banker and asked him to share his career advice with others.</p>

<p>"I think education plays a big role, but it has a lot to do with connections and being at the right place at the right time. To work in investment banking, you need to get into the industry a lot, a lot sooner... Like doing internships and all that. But then it's also the function of hard work and luck," he said.</p>

<p>In the comments section, several people were impressed by the investment banker's salary figures, while others were sceptical.&nbsp;</p>

<p>One person asked to send the investment banker's LinkedIn profile to check "what kind of qualifications he has" in the field.</p>

<p>"What the hell 300k in London? Where the national average is 35,000 pounds, most experienced person has like 90-100k, in Germany that's the salary of a district mayor," another person reacted.</p>

<p>A third user wrote, "£300k is an impossible salary in London! He has inflated his salary!"</p>

<p>Another user added, "No way, this guy is making 300K a year with 8 years of experience. 300k PKR, I believe that not GBP".</p>

<p>The investment banker was also asked whether professionals in New York earned more than the ones in London. The salary comparisons between the two cities are not entirely fair, he said.</p>

<p>"I think in New York, generally the salary scales are higher just because the market there is a lot bigger. So, it's not really a fair comparison, to be honest."</p>

<p>Investment banking remains one of the highest-paying career paths in the UK. For entry-level analysts, base salaries in London typically range between 48,000 to 69,000 pounds per year (Rs 51 lakh to Rs 73 lakh). But the total package, including bonuses, can be somewhere between 84,000 and 165,000 pounds (Rs 89 lakh to Rs 1.75 crore), according to reports on PrepLounge and Glassdoor.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A teenager whose lies about her teacher are accused of contributing to the educator's murder by an Islamist radical apologised to his family in a French court on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Eight people have been on trial since early November, charged with contributing to the climate of hatred that led to an 18-year-old of Chechen origin <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/teenager-charged-in-france-for-hailing-teacher-samuel-patys-beheading-2321329" target="_blank">beheading teacher Samuel Paty</a> outside Paris in 2020.</p>

<p>They include Brahim Chnina, the 52-year-old Moroccan father of the adolescent testifying Tuesday.</p>

<p>Then aged 13, the adolescent falsely claimed that Paty had asked Muslim students to leave his classroom before showing caricatures of the prophet Mohammed.</p>

<p>She was not in the classroom at the time.</p>

<p>"I would like to apologise to the family," the 17-year-old, who has not been named, told the court. "I destroyed your lives, I am sorry."</p>

<p>Also on trial is Abdelhakim Sefrioui, a 65-year-old French-Moroccan Islamist activist.</p>

<p>He and Chnina spread the teenager's lies on social networks with the aim, according to the prosecution, of "designating a target", "provoking a feeling of hatred" and "thus preparing several crimes".</p>

<p>Both men have been in pre-trial detention for the past four years.</p>

<p>The teenager told the court that she lied to her mother to justify why she had been suspended from school for two days over her behaviour and repeated absences.</p>

<p>"I was in panic and stress," she said. "I told her I had been in class and that I wasn't happy with what went on there and that the teacher excluded me. That we looked at cartoons."</p>

<p>'I thought somebody would stop me'</p>

<p>Sefrioui posted a video describing Paty as a "teaching thug".</p>

<p>He also staged an "interview" with the teenager outside the school, whispering to her what to answer. The adolescent dutifully reiterated the falsehoods.</p>

<p>"I thought somebody would stop me in my lying, but nobody ever said that I wasn't in class," she told the court Tuesday.</p>

<p>She stuck to her story even after Paty's death. Only following her arrest and 30 hours of interrogation did she admit to investigators that she had made it all up.</p>

<p>The teenager, whose delivery in court was matter-of-fact, showed emotion only when she talked about her father.</p>

<p>"Without my lies, none of us would be here," she said, sobbing. "I used my father's naivete and kindness."</p>

<p>She added that "my father says you must always respect teachers", a remark that prompted an astonished "really?" interjected by the court's presiding judge.</p>

<p>The teenager was sentenced to 18 months of probation in December 2023 after being convicted of slander.</p>

<p>Paty had used the Charlie Hebdo magazine as part of an ethics class to discuss free speech laws in France, where blasphemy is legal and cartoons mocking religious figures have a long history.</p>

<p>His killing took place just weeks after Charlie Hebdo republished the Prophet Mohammed cartoons.</p>

<p>After the magazine used the images in 2015, Islamist gunmen stormed its offices, killing 12 people.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An Uber Eats driver noticed an unusual smell coming from a burrito they were tasked with delivering, prompting them to contact the police in a New Jersey town.</p>

<p>Washington Township, Gloucester County police shared the details of the incident in a November 24, 2024, Instagram post, complete with emojis:</p>

<p>"An Uber Eats driver picked up a 'burrito meal' in Lindenwold NJ but noticed a strong smell of marijuana wafting from the bag while driving to Glassboro. Concerned, they pulled over in Washington Township and called us to check it out."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, earlier, a high-tech marijuana operation, using imported seeds and full-spectrum grow lights, has been busted in Greater Noida and an English graduate from Meerut has been arrested. Police said the man cultivated at least 100 marijuana plants, including premium (OG) and other varieties, at his flat in Parsvnath Panorama, selling the produce from each of them on the dark web for between ₹ 50,000 and ₹ 60,000.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russia on Tuesday expelled a British diplomat it accused of spying, telling London it would not tolerate "undeclared" intelligence officers operating on its territory, accusations that have ignited a fresh diplomatic feud with London.</p>

<p>Britain has rejected the claims one of its embassy employees was a spy, the latest in a string of espionage allegations that come with relations between the two countries running at an all-time low.</p>

<p>The spat also comes a week after Ukraine was given permission to start firing&nbsp;<strong>UK</strong>-supplied long-range missiles at Russia -- drawing scorn and threats of direct military retaliation from President Vladimir Putin -- and after Russia arrested a British man captured fighting for Ukraine.</p>

<p>The foreign ministry in Moscow summoned British ambassador Nigel Casey after the FSB security services said they had uncovered a British spy.</p>

<p>The FSB said the British diplomat, identified as the embassy's second secretary, appeared to have carried out "intelligence and subversive work, threatening the security of the Russian Federation."</p>

<p>"Moscow will not tolerate the activities of undeclared British intelligence staff on its territory," the foreign ministry said in a statement, saying it was expelling him for lying on his accreditation and visa application.</p>

<p>Footage broadcast by state media showed the ambassador being surrounded by state media journalists after he arrived at the foreign ministry in central Moscow.</p>

<h2><strong>Spy Scandals</strong></h2>

<p>The&nbsp;UK&nbsp;government rejected the allegations and pledged a response.</p>

<p>"This is not the first time that Russia has made malicious and baseless accusations against our staff. We will respond in due course," said a foreign office spokesperson.</p>

<p>London and Moscow have expelled several of each other's diplomats on spying allegations in recent years.</p>

<p>The FSB said the man expelled on Tuesday was a replacement for one of six British officials that Russia had kicked out earlier this year, also on espionage charges.</p>

<p>Relations between the two capitals have been repeatedly strained by intelligence scandals and accusations throughout Putin's quarter-century in power.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<strong>UK</strong>&nbsp;has accused Moscow of being behind the 2006 assassination of former Russian agent and Kremlin critic Alexander Litvinenko in a London poisoning attack.</p>

<p>And in 2018, Britain and its allies expelled dozens of Russian embassy officials they said were spies over the attempted poisoning of former double agent, Sergei Skripal, with Soviet-era nerve agent Novichok.</p>

<p>Skripal, who lived in exile in London, survived the attack but a British civilian died after touching a contaminated perfume bottle, triggering uproar in London.</p>

<h2>British Fighter Arrested</h2>

<p>In a symbolic move, Russia's foreign ministry announced it was banning a string of cabinet ministers from entering the country over what it called London's "Russophobic" policies.</p>

<p>Among those targeted were Chancellor Rachel Reeves, Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner, interior minister Yvette Cooper and the education, environment, health and energy ministers.</p>

<p>Since ordering troops into Ukraine, Russia has added hundreds of Western politicians, analysts, journalists and business leaders to its so-called "stop list", which Moscow sees as its answer to asset freezes and travel bans levied by the West.</p>

<p>A court in Russia's western Kursk region also confirmed Tuesday that a British citizen accused of fighting for Ukraine had been captured and arrested.</p>

<p>James Scott Rhys Anderson, 22, was ordered remanded in custody on allegations he had "participated in armed hostilities on the territory of the Kursk region".</p>

<p>It was the first official confirmation from Russia of Anderson's arrest, following an unverified video that was published on pro-Kremlin Telegram channels over the weekend.</p>

<p>The Leninsky court in Kursk said he was suspected of "committing a set of particularly serious offences that post a danger to society", though did not say exactly what he was being charged with.</p>

<p>Russia considers foreigners travelling to fight in Ukraine as "mercenaries", enabling prosecution under its criminal code rather than treating them as prisoners of war under the Geneva Convention.</p>

<p>In 2022, a court in Russian-occupied eastern Ukraine sentenced two British fighters to death for fighting for Ukraine, although they were later released in a prisoner of war exchange.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

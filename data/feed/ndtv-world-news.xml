       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Elon Musk's SpaceX successfully completed its sixth flight test of the Starship spacecraft on Wednesday. The uncrewed mission, launched from SpaceX's Starbase in Texas, saw the Starship spacecraft achieve a suborbital trajectory before reentering over the Indian Ocean, while the Super Heavy booster executed a planned ocean splashdown.</p>

<p dir="ltr">“Splashdown confirmed! Congratulations to the entire SpaceX team on an exciting sixth flight test of Starship!” SpaceX announced on X (formerly known as Twitter).</p>

— SpaceX (@SpaceX) <a href="https://twitter.com/SpaceX/status/1859010620471079361?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 19, 2024</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p dir="ltr">US President-elect Donald Trump also observed the launch alongside SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, reported <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/19/science/starship-test-flight-6-launch-spacex/index.html" rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">CNN</a>.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The nearly 400-foot-tall Starship system, composed of the Starship spacecraft and its Super Heavy booster, launched during a 30-minute window starting at 3:30 am IST. The goal was to test the system's limits, including a more aggressive reentry angle for Starship and the ignition of its Raptor engines in space.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">While the Super Heavy booster was slated for a precision landing on the company's launch tower arms – nicknamed "Mechazilla" – SpaceX concluded that conditions were unfavourable and went for a safe splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico instead, the CNN report added.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">This flight represents critical progress toward Starship's role in NASA's Artemis programme, which aims to return astronauts to the Moon by 2026. The spacecraft will serve as a lunar lander for the mission, with plans for future flights involving complex docking manoeuvres and fuel transfers in orbit.</p>

<p dir="ltr">“Congrats to SpaceX on Starship's sixth test flight. Exciting to see the Raptor engine restart in space—major progress towards orbital flight. Starship's success is Artemis' success. Together, we will return humanity to the Moon and set our sights on Mars,” NASA Administrator Bill Nelson wrote on X.</p>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p dir="ltr">This test flight incorporated new challenges, such as operating Starship with reduced protective shielding and pushing the flaps – some key components for atmospheric reentry – to their stress limits.</p>

<p dir="ltr">SpaceX engineer Kate Tice talked about the importance of testing under extreme conditions. “Turns out the vehicle had more capability than our calculations predicted, and that is why we test like we fly,” she was quoted as saying by CNN.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Looking ahead, SpaceX plans long-duration flight tests and propellant transfer demonstrations in 2025, which will be significant for the Artemis III mission. These tests involve complex logistics, such as refuelling Starship in orbit to sustain lunar missions.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President-elect Donald Trump nominated Howard Lutnick, the co-chair of his transition team, as his commerce secretary on Tuesday -- a choice set to bring a tougher stance on China from the incoming administration.</p>

<p>Lutnick will also lead the country's tariff and trade agenda, with "additional direct responsibility for the Office of the United States Trade Representative," Trump said in a statement.</p>

<p>Tariffs are a key part of Trump's economic agenda, and he has promised sweeping duties on all imports when he returns to the White House.</p>

<p>Lutnick is chief executive of financial services firm Cantor Fitzgerald, and a Trump ally originally tipped as a frontrunner for treasury secretary.</p>

<p>But he was instead named to helm Commerce, a smaller department that works to boost US industry and has a key role in policy to shore up the US semiconductor sector and reduce reliance on Asia.</p>

<p>Under President Joe Biden, the Commerce Department stepped up export controls on critical technologies like quantum computing and semiconductor manufacturing goods, taking aim at access by adversaries like Beijing.</p>

<p>Trump's administration could harden this stance.</p>

<p>Lutnick has, during the US election campaign, expressed support for a tariff level of 60 percent on Chinese goods, alongside a 10 percent tariff on all imports.</p>

<p>Both are among proposals that Trump has floated, with the Republican taking aim at countries which have been "ripping us off for years."</p>

<p>Lutnick also previously lamented the loss of manufacturing jobs in the United States and offshoring to China.</p>

<p>"I'm all in with Donald Trump," Lutnick told podcaster Anthony Pompliano last month.</p>

<p>In the same interview, he slammed electric cars as "coastal elite nonsense" and blamed China for being the source of fentanyl in the United States.</p>

<p>The deadly drug, many times more powerful than heroin, is responsible for tens of thousands of overdose deaths a year.</p>

<p>"China is attacking America from its guts," he charged.</p>

<p><strong>Crypto support</strong></p>

<p>Lutnick was initially tipped to head the Treasury Department but a tussle over the position spilled into the public eye last weekend.</p>

<p>Trump's health secretary pick Robert F. Kennedy Jr. expressed support for Lutnick, saying on social media that "Bitcoin will have no stronger advocate" than him.</p>

<p>The world's richest man Elon Musk also threw his support behind Lutnick for Treasury chief while calling the other top contender, hedge fund manager Scott Bessent, "a business-as-usual choice."</p>

<p>"Business-as-usual is driving America bankrupt, so we need change one way or another," said Musk, who Trump has tapped to lead a new Department of Government Efficiency, on social media.</p>

<p>Besides Cantor Fitzgerald, Lutnick heads financial technology firm BGC Group and real estate services firm Newmark Group.</p>

<p>He graduated from Haverford College and has a degree in economics, according to his biography on Cantor's website.</p>

<p>As co-chair of Trump's transition team, Lutnick has been identifying new hires for the president-elect's administration.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Around 10,900 North Korean troops have been deployed to Kursk as part of Russia's airborne unit and marines, with some already participating in battles in the Ukraine war, a South Korean lawmaker said on Wednesday citing the country's spy agency.</p>

<p>North Korea has also shipped additional arms for the war in Ukraine, including self-propelled howitzers and multiple rocket launchers, parliament intelligence committee member Park Sun-won told reporters, citing the National Intelligence Service (NIS).</p>

<p>North Korean foreign minister Choe Son Hui's meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin during her visit to Moscow this month was unusual in terms of protocol, and likely went beyond exchanging greetings to cover more significant issues including a possible visit to Russia by Kim Jong Un, the lawmaker said, citing NIS.</p>

<p>The spy agency is still trying to determine the exact number of North Korean troop casualties and whether any had surrendered amid conflicting information, the lawmaker said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Peruvian authorities said Tuesday they have tightened security at the Inca citadel of Machu Picchu after tourists there were filmed dispersing what were believed to be human ashes.</p>

<p>Last week, citizens in Peru were outraged by a non-dated video on Tiktok in which a woman at the tourist site took ashes from a plastic bag and threw them in the air, then hugged another woman.</p>

<p>The video had a caption about "saying goodbye with much love at Machu Picchu" and hashtags with the words "ashes" and "spreading ashes."</p>

<p>The 30-second video was first shown on the account @IncaGoExpeditions, belonging to a travel agency, before it was removed from TikTok.</p>

<p>Cesar Medina, the head of Machu Picchu archeological park, told AFP that officials were going to hire more guards and install more surveillance cameras.</p>

<p>He said there was nothing in local laws barring people from spreading human ashes in public.</p>

<p>But this will now be barred at Machu Picchu for health reasons, Medina said.</p>

<p>Classified as a UNESCO World Heritage site, the site welcomes an average of 5,600 visitors a day but until now had only four cameras and a small team of security guards.</p>

<p>The ancient citadel, built in the 15th century by Incan emperor Pachacuti, sits at an altitude of 2,438 meters in the Peruvian Andes.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA["With Pakistan, the main issue we have is of terrorism," India's Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador Parvathaneni Harish said.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The first issue in engaging with Pakistan is the cessation of terrorism, India's envoy at the UN said, underlining that India has been a long-standing victim of cross-border and global terrorism and has zero tolerance towards the scourge.</p>

<p>"With Pakistan, the main issue we have is of terrorism," India's Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador Parvathaneni Harish said during a conversation here on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Harish delivered the keynote address on 'Responding to Key Global Challenges: The India Way' at an event at Columbia University's School of International and Public Affairs (SIPA).</p>

<p>Responding to a question on Pakistan during an interactive session after the keynote address, Harish said Prime Minister Narendra Modi made an effort to reach out and engage with Pakistan.</p>

<p>"Terrorist activities in India have eroded the trust. The first issue in engaging with Pakistan is the cessation of terrorism. That is a key issue."</p>

<p>The event was co-sponsored by the MPA programme in Global Leadership and the International Organisation and UN Studies programme (IO/UNS) and attended by students, faculty and policy experts.</p>

<p>In his address, Harish emphasised that terrorism is a big issue on the global stage.</p>

<p>"India has been a long-standing victim of cross-border and global terrorism," he said as he described terrorism as an "existential threat" to humanity that knows no borders, no nationality and for which there can be no justification.</p>

<p>"Terrorism can only be combated through international collaboration," he said.</p>

<p>On what is the 'India Way' in dealing with terrorism, Harish underlined that a "big focus" for the country has been on taking along its international partners to combat terrorism as he stressed that India has zero tolerance for the scourge.</p>

<p>"A single attack is one too many. A single-life loss is one too many. How do we reinvigorate the international counter-terrorism agenda, including at the UN and especially at the UN? How do we address new challenges in dealing with terrorism, cyber terror, new technologies, terror financing, state culpability and online radicalisation? How do we ensure that justice is delivered to victims of terrorism," he said adding that accountability and justice delivery are very important.</p>

<p>Emphasising that justice delayed is justice denied, Harish said the end goal is "Never again. We don't want a 9/11, has happened here. We don't want a 26/11. Has happened in Mumbai," a reference to the September 11 terror attacks on the World Trade Centre twin towers in Manhattan carried out by Al Qaeda and the November 26, 2008 terror attacks across Mumbai perpetrated by Pakistan-based terror outfit Lashkar-e-Taiba.</p>

<p>He further noted that unfortunately, there has been an enhanced salience of nuclear weapons now. "India has always stood for universal, verifiable, non-discriminatory nuclear disarmament. We do not believe that you can create pools of nuclear weapons-free zones in a world where the means of delivery are global, so we stand for universal disarmament, of course, verifiable and non-discriminatory."</p>

<p>India follows a policy of maintaining a credible minimum deterrence based on no first use and non-use of nuclear weapons against non-nuclear weapon states, he said.</p>

<p>"In recent years, a big issue, of course, is new threats and increasingly, the international community is called upon to collaborate to come up with measures to prevent terrorists from acquiring weapons of mass destruction," he said.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Checking imported books, removing texts from libraries and distributing lists of banned titles -- Taliban authorities are working to remove "un-Islamic" and anti-government literature from circulation.</p>

<p>The efforts are led by a commission established under the Ministry of Information and Culture soon after the Taliban swept to power in 2021 and implemented their strict interpretation of Islamic law, or sharia.</p>

<p>In October, the ministry announced the commission had identified 400 books "that conflicted with Islamic and Afghan values, most of which have been collected from the markets".</p>

<p>The department in charge of publishing has distributed copies of the Koran and other Islamic texts to replace seized books, the ministry statement said.</p>

<p>The ministry has not provided figures for the number of removed books, but two sources, a publisher in Kabul and a government employee, said texts had been collected in the first year of Taliban rule and again in recent months.</p>

<p>"There is a lot of censorship. It is very difficult to work, and fear has spread everywhere," the Kabul publisher told AFP.</p>

<p>Books were also restricted under the previous foreign-backed government ousted by the Taliban, when there was "a lot of corruption, pressures and other issues", he said.</p>

<p>But "there was no fear, one could say whatever he or she wanted to say", he added.</p>

<p>"Whether or not we could make any change, we could raise our voices."</p>

<p><strong>'Contradictory to religion'</strong></p>

<p>AFP received a list of five of the banned titles from an information ministry official.</p>

<p>It includes "Jesus the Son of Man" by renowned Lebanese-American author Khalil Gibran, for containing "blasphemous expressions", and the "counterculture" novel "Twilight of the Eastern Gods" by Albanian author Ismail Kadare.</p>

<p>"Afghanistan and the Region: A West Asian Perspective" by Mirwais Balkhi, an education minister under the former government, was also banned for "negative propaganda".</p>

<p>During the Taliban's previous rule from 1996 to 2001, there were comparatively few publishing houses and booksellers in Kabul, the country having already been wracked by decades of war.</p>

<p>Today, thousands of books are imported each week alone from neighbouring Iran -- which shares the Persian language with Afghanistan -- through the Islam Qala border crossing in western Herat province.</p>

<p>Taliban authorities rifled through boxes of a shipment at a customs warehouse in Herat city last week.</p>

<p>One man flipped through a thick English-language title, as another, wearing a camouflage uniform with a man's image on the shoulder patch, searched for pictures of people and animals in the books.</p>

<p>"We have not banned books from any specific country or person, but we study the books and we block those that are contradictory to religion, sharia or the government, or if they have photos of living things," said Mohammad Sediq Khademi, an official with the Herat department for the Propagation of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice (PVPV).</p>

<p>"Any books that are against religion, faith, sect, sharia... we will not allow them," the 38-year-old told AFP, adding the evaluations of imported books started some three months ago.</p>

<p>Images of living things -- barred under some interpretations of Islam -- are restricted according to a recent "vice and virtue" law that codifies rules imposed since the Taliban returned to power, but the regulations have been unevenly enforced.</p>

<p>Importers have been advised of which books to avoid, and when books are deemed unsuitable, they are given the option of returning them and getting their money back, Khademi said.</p>

<p>"But if they can't, we don't have any other option but to seize them," he added.</p>

<p>"Once, we had 28 cartons of books that were rejected."</p>

<p><strong>Clearing stock</strong></p>

<p>Authorities have not gone from shop to shop checking for banned books, an official with the provincial information department and a Herat bookseller said, asking not to be named.</p>

<p>However, some books have been removed from Herat libraries and Kabul bookstores, a bookseller told AFP, also asking for anonymity, including "The History of Jihadi Groups in Afghanistan" by Afghan author Yaqub Mashauf.</p>

<p>Books bearing images of living things can still be found in Herat shops.</p>

<p>In Kabul and Takhar -- a northern province where booksellers said they had received the list of 400 banned books -- disallowed titles remained on some shelves.</p>

<p>Many non-Afghan works were banned, one seller said, "so they look at the author, whose name is there, and they are mostly banned" if they're foreign.</p>

<p>His bookshop still carried translations of Russian author Fyodor Dostoyevsky's "The Gambler" and fantasy novel "Daughter of the Moon Goddess" by Sue Lynn Tan.</p>

<p>But he was keen to sell them "very cheap" now, to clear them from his stock.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump nominated Linda McMahon, former CEO of World Wrestling Entertainment, on Tuesday to lead the Department of Education, which he has pledged to abolish.</p>

<p>Describing McMahon as a "fierce advocate for Parents' Rights," Trump said in a statement: "We will send Education BACK TO THE STATES, and Linda will spearhead that effort."</p>

<p>McMahon is a co-chair of Trump's transition team ahead of his return to the White House in January. It is tasked with filling some 4,000 positions in the government.</p>

<p>Regarding McMahon's experience in education, Trump cited her two-year stint on the Connecticut Board of Education and 16 years on the board of trustees at Sacred Heart University, a private Catholic school.</p>

<p>McMahon left WWE in 2009 to run in vain for US Senate, and has been a major donor to Trump.</p>

<p>Since 2021, she has chaired the Center For The American Worker at the Trump-aligned America First Policy Institute.</p>

<p>During the election campaign Trump promised to do away with the federal education department when he returns to the White House.</p>

<p>"I say it all the time. I'm dying to get back to do this. We will ultimately eliminate the federal Department of Education,” he said in September during a rally in Wisconsin.</p>

<p>At the Republican convention in Milwaukee, McMahon said she was "privileged to call Donald Trump a colleague and a boss," as well as "a friend."</p>

<p>Her ties with Trump go back to her years in the professional wrestling industry -- she said she first met him as chief executive at WWE.</p>

<p>At the culmination of a staged feud, Trump once body-slammed her husband, legendary wrestling promoter Vince McMahon, and shaved his head in the middle of a wrestling ring on live television.</p>

<p>In 2017, she was confirmed as the head of the Small Business Administration, which is responsible for supporting America's millions of small businesses, which employ around half the country's private-sector workforce.</p>

<p>In nominating her, Trump pointed to her experience in business, helping to grow the WWE.</p>

<p>After leaving the administration, she served as chair of the pro-Trump America First Action SuperPAC, or political action committee.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Google recruiter shared her top three tips on LinkedIn for aspiring tech professionals aiming to experience the coveted "Life at Google."</p>

<p>Erica, a Google interviewer, emphasized the importance of strong engagement and creativity during the hiring process, noting that interviewers are always keen on finding the perfect candidate for open roles.</p>

<p>Google's interviews are famously challenging, but Erica highlights the STAR method as a key tool for success. "When interviewing at Google, I always recommend using the STAR method to structure your responses. Explain the Situation, outline the Task you undertook, describe the Actions you implemented, and share the Results you achieved. This approach ensures clarity and keeps your answers focused," she advises.</p>

<p>When it comes to crafting a resume, Erica stresses aligning it with the job description.

Understanding the nuances of the role and aligning your experience accordingly can significantly boost your chances.</p>

<p>Finally, she encourages candidates to focus on networking. "If you're interested in a role, use social media to find professionals already in that position. Look at their career trajectory, the activities they're involved in, and their previous job titles. Use that information to guide your own search," Erica explains. Networking can offer invaluable insights and connections to help secure your dream role.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday arrived in Guyana on the last leg of his three-nation visit after attending the G20 Summit in Brazil.</p>

<p>In an unprecedented gesture, the prime minister was received at the airport by President Irfan Ali and over a dozen cabinet ministers, officials said.</p>

<p>PM Modi's arrival marks the first visit of an Indian prime minister to Guyana in more than 50 years.</p>

<p>PM Modi, who is visiting Guyana at the invitation of President Mohamed Irfaan Ali, will remain in the country till November 21.</p>

<p>During his visit, PM Modi will meet Ali and exchange views on giving strategic direction to the unique relationship between the two countries.</p>

<p>He will also pay respect to one of the oldest Indian diasporas, which migrated more than 185 years ago, and engage a fellow democracy with an address in Guyana's parliament.</p>

<p>According to the MEA, there are around 3,20,000 people of Indian origin in Guyana.</p>

<p>PM Modi will also join leaders from the Caribbean partner countries for the second India-CARICOM Summit.</p>

<p>The prime minister has been on a three-nation visit that included a "productive" trip to Nigeria, where he held bilateral talks with President Bola Ahmed Tinubu and interacted with the Indian community.</p>

<p>PM Modi was also conferred with the country's national award -- the Grand Commander of the Order of the Niger (GCON). It was the 17th international award conferred on PM Modi by a country.</p>

<p>PM Modi's visit to Nigeria was the first trip to the West African country by an Indian prime minister in 17 years.</p>

<p>From Nigeria, PM Modi travelled to Brazil to attend the G20 Summit.</p>

<p>In Brazil, he met global leaders, including US President Joe Biden, French President Emmanuel Macron and UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer.</p>

<p>On Monday, PM Modi briefly interacted with Biden on the sidelines of the summit in their first exchanges following the US presidential election.</p>

<p>During an address at a session of the summit on Monday, PM Modi said India's G20 theme of "One Earth, One Family, One Future" was as relevant at the latest summit as it was last year.</p>

<p>The countries of the Global South are most adversely impacted by the food, fuel and fertiliser crisis caused by global conflicts and the G20 must focus on addressing it, the prime minister said.</p>

<p>Biden, PM Modi, Chinese President Xi Jinping, Macron and Starmer were among the leaders attending the two-day summit in Rio de Janeiro.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, PM Modi held several bilateral meetings on the sidelines of the summit.</p>

<p>He met leaders from Brazil, Italy, Indonesia and Portugal, Norway, Chile, Argentina, Egypt, South Korea and discussed ways to deepen ties in sectors such as defence, security, trade and technology.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The body was of 24-year-old Harshita Brella, an Indian woman who was born in Delhi and moved to the United Kingdom in April this year after marrying Pankaj Lamba in August last year.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On the morning of November 11, police in East London's Ilford found a body inside the boot of a silver Vauxhall Corsa parked on Brisbane Road. The body was of 24-year-old Harshita Brella, an Indian woman who was born in Delhi and moved to the United Kingdom in April this year after marrying Pankaj Lamba in August last year. Days earlier, she had disappeared from her home in Northamptonshire. A post-mortem examination of the body revealed that she had been strangled.</p>

<p>According to the police, Harshita had likely been murdered by her husband, Pankaj, 23, who allegedly fled the country shortly after committing the crime. Harshita's body, concealed in the car's boot, had been transported 145 kilometres south to Ilford before being abandoned.</p>

<p>"Our inquiries lead us to suspect that Harshita was murdered in Northamptonshire earlier this month by her husband Pankaj Lamba," said Northampton Police.</p>

<p>"We suspect Lamba transported Harshita's body from Northamptonshire to Ilford (east London) by car. We believe he has now fled the country... More than 60 detectives are working on the case and are continuing to follow numerous lines of inquiry, including house-to-house, property searches, CCTV and ANPR (automatic number plate recognition)," the statement added.</p>

<p>Harshita was last heard from on the evening of November 10, when she told her family she was preparing dinner and awaiting her husband's return. Concern grew when her phone remained off for two days, prompting her family to contact Northamptonshire Police on November 13. Officers visiting her home on Skegness Walk found no trace of her, prompting an investigation.</p>

<p>The next day, in the early hours of November 14, her body was discovered in Ilford. By then, Pankaj had disappeared, evading authorities and sparking an international manhunt.</p>

<p>The murder investigation revealed Harshita had endured a history of domestic violence. In September, she was granted a Domestic Violence Protection Order (DVPO) against her husband following incidents of abuse. However, despite legal measures, the threat remained.</p>

<p>Neighbours reported hearing arguments from the couple's home in the days before her death. One recalled a particularly intense confrontation in which a woman "sounded scared."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Harshita's family, based in Delhi, spoke of their anguish in media interviews. Her father, Satbir Brella, described her as a simple, determined young woman with aspirations of becoming a teacher. After marrying Pankaj in an arranged match, she moved to the UK in April. According to Harshita's sister Sonia Dabas, she worked in a warehouse and Pankaj was a student in London.</p>

<p>&nbsp;"I want my son-in-law to be brought to justice and I want my daughter's body brought home," said Satbir Brella, Harshita's father, as quoted by the BBC.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"She was a part of me and I was a part of her. I now feel like I can't do anything in life without her," said Sonia, adding that Harshita had previously fled her home after being assaulted by Pankaj but returned, hoping to salvage the marriage.</p>

<p>According to the family, Pankaj had complained about Harshita speaking too often to her mother or not preparing meals on time. In August, Harshita called her father to say she had run away due to Pankaj's violent behaviour.</p>

<p>CCTV images released by the police show the silver Vauxhall Corsa, which investigators believe was used to transport Harshita's body. However, Pankaj's whereabouts remain unknown. Police have appealed to the public for any information about sightings of Pankaj or suspicious activity in Corby and Ilford around the time of the murder.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ukraine "will lose" its war against Russia if the United States cuts military funding to Kyiv, President Volodymyr Zelensky told Fox News on Tuesday.</p>

<p>"If they cut, we will -- I think we will lose," Zelensky said in an interview with the US television network.</p>

<p>"We will fight. We have our production, but it's not enough to prevail. And I think it's not enough to survive," he continued.</p>

<p>US President-elect Donald Trump is a vocal skeptic of the billions that the administration of President Joe Biden has given to Ukraine since the Russian invasion began in 2022.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-election-results-2024-what-donald-trump-said-about-wars-in-trump-2-0-victory-speech-6956202">Trump has repeatedly promised to end the war quickly</a>, but has not provided details of how he would do so.</p>

<p>This week his allies voiced vehement criticism of Biden's decision to let Ukraine use US-supplied long-range missiles for attacks inside Russia, accusing him of a dangerous escalation.</p>

<p>Zelensky told Fox that "unity" between Ukraine and the United States was "most important."</p>

<p>Trump, he said, could influence Russian President Vladimir Putin to end the war, "because he is much more stronger than Putin."</p>

<p>Putin "can be willing and end this war, but it also depends on the United States of America much more. Putin is weaker than the United States of America," he said.</p>

<p>With Russia gaining ground and increasing talk of negotiations, Ukraine is wary of being at a disadvantage when it comes to hashing out a peace settlement.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Bitcoin rose to a record high above $94,000 after reports of Donald Trump's social media company in talks to buy crypto trading firm Bakkt gave hope.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin rose to a record high above $94,000 as a report that Donald Trump's social media company was in talks to buy crypto trading firm Bakkt added to hopes of a cryptocurrency-friendly regime under the incoming Trump administration.</p>

<p>Bitcoin, the world's biggest and best-known cryptocurrency, has more than doubled this year. It was last at $92,104 in Asian hours on Wednesday, having touched a record high of $94,078 just toward the end of the previous session.</p>

<p>The Financial Times, citing two people with knowledge, said Trump Media and Technology Group, which operates Truth Social, is close to an all-stock acquisition of Bakkt, which is backed by NYSE-owner Intercontinental Exchange.</p>

<p>Tony Sycamore, market analyst at IG, said bitcoin's rise to a record high was supported by the Trump deal talk report as well as traders taking advantage of the first day of options trading on the Nasdaq over BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF.</p>

<p>Cryptocurrencies have soared since the Nov. 5 U.S. election as traders bet President-elect Trump's promised support for digital assets would lead to a less restrictive regulatory regime and inject some life back into bitcoin after a listless few months.</p>

<p>The growing excitement has taken the global cryptocurrency market's value above $3 trillion to a record high, based on analytics and data aggregator CoinGecko.</p>

<p>Chris Weston, head of research at Australian online broker Pepperstone, said there is real underlying buying pressure for bitcoin, and "another kick higher should bring in a fresh chase from those who like to buy what's strong".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Japanese manicurist Naomi Arimoto has been using Umigomi, or "sea trash," to make nail art since 2021.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Before global leaders take the problem of plastic pollution into their hands this month, Japanese manicurist Naomi Arimoto is putting it into her fingernails.</p>

<p>At the beach near her home south of Tokyo, Arimoto carefully sifts sand for tiny bits of plastic that she can mould into decorative tips to put on the false nails at her salon. She came up with the idea after taking part in community cleanups along the coast.</p>

<p>"I became aware of environmental issues the moment I saw with my own eyes just how much plastic waste was in the ocean," 42-year-old Arimoto said. "I thought it was horrifying."</p>

<p>An estimated 20 million tonnes of plastic waste is dumped into the environment each year, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature. A United Nations summit in Busan, South Korea, starting on Nov. 25 aims to craft a landmark treaty that would set global caps on plastic production.</p>

<p>The United States, one of the world's biggest plastic makers, signalled in August it would support a global treaty, a shift that environmental watchdog Greenpeace called a "watershed moment" in the fight against plastic pollution.</p>

<p>Arimoto opened a nail salon in her home in 2018 after a spinal condition forced her to give up her career as a social worker, and she's been using Umigomi, or "sea trash," to make nail art since 2021. To gather the raw materials, she uses a custom wheelchair to scour the nearby beach every month to gather microplastics that other cleaners might miss.</p>

<p>To turn sea trash into treasure, Arimoto starts by rinsing the plastic in fresh water and then sorting it by colour. She cuts the plastic into smaller pieces and places them into a metal ring before melting the plastic to form a colourful disc that can be attached to the artificial nails. Prices for a set start at 12,760 yen ($82.52).</p>

<p>"I know there are other things made of recycled materials, like toilet paper and other daily necessities, but I had no idea you could have nails too, that was a surprise," said salon customer Kyoko Kurokawa, 57.</p>

<p>Arimoto acknowledges that her nail art is a drop in an ocean of plastic pollution, but says raising consciousness of the problem is a step to towards working together for a solution.</p>

<p>"I hope that by putting these in front of people's eyes, on their fingertips, they'll enjoy fashion while also becoming more aware of environmental issues," she said.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Donald Trump has nominated Fox Business host Sean Duffy to be the next Transportation Secretary. The former congressman will replace Pete Buttigieg in January to oversee a huge federal portfolio of infrastructure spending and transit regulations.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<ol class="CetSht_ol">
	<li class="CetSht_li">Sean Duffy was born on October 3, 1971, in Hayward, Wisconsin. He was part of a large family and was the 10th of 11 children his parents had. &nbsp;He has a marketing degree from St. Mary's University, and a JD degree from William Mitchell College of Law.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Sean Duffy is the second Fox News host to join Donald Trump's cabinet after Pete Hegseth was nominated Defence Secretary. He is married to another Fox News personality Rachel Campos-Duffy.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Sean Duffy and his wife Rachel Campos-Duffy have 9 children - Evita Pilar, Xavier Jack, Lucia-Belen, John-Paul, Paloma Pilar, MariaVictoria Margarita, Margarita Pilar, Patrick Miguel and StellaMaris.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Sean Duffy first met his future wife on the set of MTV's 'Road Rules: All Stars' in 1998. They had appeared separately on MTV's Real World programs. While Sean Duffy was on The Real World: Boston, his future wife Rachel was on The Real World: San Francisco.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Mr Duffy was also an athlete. He holds two speed-climbing titles. He had started log rolling when he was 5 years old and speed climbing at the age of 13. He has even appeared as a commentator for ESPN's 'Great Outdoor Games'.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Sean Duffy had entered the US Congress during the Tea Party wave of the early 2010s. He later went on to become an ally of Donald Trump</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Before becoming a Congressman, he was a practicing lawyer and had worked as a district attorney for more than 8 years.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">He served in the House of Representatives for nearly nine years, where he was a member of the Financial Services Committee.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Mr Duffy quit in 2019 when he and his wife found out that their ninth child had a heart condition. Speaking about his resignation at the time, Mr Duffy had said that being away from his family for four days every week to serve in Congress was difficult. He had said "I have always been open to signs from God when it comes to balancing my desire to serve both my family and my country. I have decided that this is the right time for me to take a break from public service in order to be the support my wife, baby and family need right now."</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Announcing Mr Duffy's nomination on Truth Social, Donald Trump said the incoming Transportation Secretary was a tremendous and well-liked public servant, admired across the aisle. "He will prioritise excellence, competence, competitiveness and beauty when rebuilding America's highways, tunnels, bridges and airports," Mr Trump said.</li>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President-elect Donald Trump has made a flurry of picks for his cabinet and other high-ranking administration positions following his election victory.</p>

<p>Here are the early picks and top contenders for some of the key posts overseeing defense, intelligence, health, diplomacy, trade, immigration and economic policymaking.</p>

<p><strong>MARCO RUBIO, secretary of state</strong></p>

<p>Trump tapped US Senator Marco Rubio to be his secretary of state, putting the Florida-born politician on track to be the first Latino to serve as the United States' top diplomat.</p>

<p>Rubio, 53, was arguably the most hawkish option on Trump's shortlist for secretary of state. The senator has in past years advocated for a muscular foreign policy with respect to US geopolitical foes, including China, Iran and Cuba.</p>

<p>Over the last several years he has softened some of his stances to align more closely with Trump's views. The president-elect accuses past US presidents of leading the US into costly and futile wars and has pushed for a less interventionist foreign policy.</p>

<p><strong>MATT GAETZ, attorney general</strong></p>

<p>Trump said that he had selected Gaetz, a US representative, to be his nominee for attorney general.</p>

<p>"Few issues in America are more important than ending the partisan Weaponization of our Justice System," Trump said in a statement announcing the selection of the Florida lawmaker.</p>

<p>Trump's inner circle has described the attorney general as the most important member of the administration after Trump himself, key to his plans to carry out mass deportations, pardon Jan. 6 rioters and seek retribution against those who prosecuted him over the past four years.</p>

<p><strong>TULSI GABBARD, director of national intelligence</strong></p>

<p>Trump named Gabbard, a former Democratic representative and critic of the Biden administration, as his director of national intelligence.</p>

<p>Gabbard left the Democratic Party in 2022 to become an independent and has little direct experience with intelligence work. If confirmed, she would become the top official in the US intelligence community after Trump starts his second term in January.</p>

<p><strong>ROBERT F. KENNEDY, JR., health and human services secretary</strong></p>

<p>Kennedy is an environmental activist who has spread misinformation about the dangers of vaccines. He has suggested he would gut the 18,000-employee Food and Drug Administration, which ensures the safety of food, drugs and medical devices, and replace hundreds of employees at the National Institutes of Health.</p>

<p>Kennedy ran for president in this year's election, first as a Democrat and then as an independent, before dropping out in August in exchange for a role in Trump's administration.</p>

<p>The Department of Health and Human Services oversees the Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Institutes of Health and the massive Medicare and Medicaid Services programs, which provide health coverage for the poor, those aged 65 and older, and the disabled.</p>

<p><strong>PETE HEGSETH, defense secretary</strong></p>

<p>Trump said he had picked Hegseth as his secretary of defense. Hegseth is a Fox News commentator and veteran who has expressed disdain for the so-called "woke" policies of Pentagon leaders, including its top military officer.</p>

<p>Hegseth, if confirmed by the Senate, could make good on Trump's campaign promises to rid the US military of generals who he accuses of pursuing progressive policies on diversity in the ranks that conservatives have rallied against.</p>

<p>It could also set up a collision course between Hegseth and the chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Air Force General CQ Brown, who Hegseth accused of "pursuing the radical positions of left-wing politicians."</p>

<p><strong>LEE ZELDIN, EPA administrator</strong></p>

<p>Trump announced he had appointed Zeldin, a former congressman from New York state, as administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.</p>

<p>Zeldin, 44, a staunch Trump ally, served in Congress from 2015 to 2023. In 2022, he lost the New York governor's race to Democratic incumbent Kathy Hochul. Trump has promised to overhaul US energy policy, with the aim of maximizing the country's already record-high oil and gas production by rolling back regulations and speeding up permitting.</p>

<p><strong>MIKE WALTZ, national security adviser</strong></p>

<p>Trump said he had picked Waltz, a Republican US representative, to be national security adviser. Waltz is a retired Army Green Beret who has been a leading critic of China.</p>

<p>Waltz, a 50-year-old Trump loyalist who also served in the National Guard as a colonel, has criticized Chinese activity in the Asia-Pacific and has voiced the need for the US to be ready for a potential conflict in the region.</p>

<p>The national security adviser is a powerful role, which does not require Senate confirmation. Waltz will be responsible for briefing Trump on key national security issues and coordinating with different agencies.</p>

<p>While slamming the Biden administration for a disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021, Waltz has publicly praised Trump's foreign policy views.</p>

<p><strong>SUSIE WILES, chief of staff</strong></p>

<p>Trump announced that Wiles, one of his two campaign managers, will be his White House chief of staff.</p>

<p>While the specifics of her political views are somewhat unclear, Wiles, 67, is credited with running a successful and efficient campaign. Supporters hope she will instill a sense of order and discipline that was often lacking during Trump's first four-year term, when he cycled through a number of chiefs of staff.</p>

<p><strong>TOM HOMAN, 'border czar'</strong></p>

<p>Trump said that Homan, the acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement during Trump's first administration, will be in charge of the country's borders.</p>

<p>Trump made cracking down on people in the country illegally a central element of his campaign, promising mass deportations.</p>

<p>Homan, 62, said on Monday he would prioritize deporting immigrants illegally in the US who posed safety and security threats as well as those working at job sites.</p>

<p><strong>ELISE STEFANIK, UN ambassador</strong></p>

<p>Trump announced that Stefanik, a Republican congresswoman and staunch Trump supporter, would be his ambassador to the United Nations.</p>

<p>Stefanik, 40, a US representative from New York state and House Republican conference chair, took a leadership position in the House of Representatives in 2021 when she was elected to replace then-Representative Liz Cheney, who was ousted for criticizing Trump's false claims of election fraud.</p>

<p>Stefanik will arrive at the UN after bold promises by Trump to end the Russia-Ukraine war and Israel's war in Gaza.</p>

<p><strong>ELON MUSK AND VIVEK RAMASWAMY, heads of Department of Government Efficiency</strong></p>

<p>Trump named tech billionaire Musk and Ramaswamy, a former Republican presidential candidate, to lead a newly created Department of Government Efficiency, rewarding two of his well-known supporters from the private sector.</p>

<p>Trump said that Musk and Ramaswamy will reduce government bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut waste and restructure federal agencies. Trump said the new department would bring in external expertise and work with the White House and Office of Management and Budget.</p>

<p><strong>KRISTI NOEM, homeland security secretary</strong></p>

<p>Noem, the governor of South Dakota, has been picked to serve as the next homeland security secretary, Trump said.</p>

<p>Noem, 52, once seen as a possible running mate for Trump, is currently serving her second four-year term as South Dakota's governor. She rose to national prominence after refusing to impose a statewide mask mandate during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>The Department of Homeland Security is responsible for everything from border protection and immigration to disaster response and the US Secret Service.</p>

<p><strong>DOUG BURGUM, interior secretary and 'energy czar'</strong></p>

<p>Trump has chosen Burgum, the governor of North Dakota, to be interior secretary.</p>

<p>Burgum, 68, a wealthy former software company executive, has portrayed himself as a traditional, business-minded conservative. He ran against Trump for the Republican presidential nomination before quitting and becoming a loyal Trump supporter.</p>

<p>The Interior Department manages public lands and minerals, national parks and wildlife refuges. The department also carries out the US government's trust responsibility to Native Americans. In the energy czar role, he is expected to coordinate with several agencies to boost oil and gas output.</p>

<p><strong>JOHN RATCLIFFE, CIA director</strong></p>

<p>Trump said he had picked Ratcliffe, the former director of national intelligence, to serve as director of the Central Intelligence Agency in his second administration.</p>

<p>A former congressman and prosecutor who served as director of national intelligence during Trump's last year in office, Ratcliffe, 59, is seen as a hardcore Trump loyalist who could likely win Senate confirmation. Still, during his time as director of national intelligence, Ratcliffe often contradicted the assessments of career civil servants, drawing criticism from Democrats who said he politicized the role.</p>

<p><strong>HOWARD LUTNICK, commerce secretary</strong></p>

<p>The co-chair of Trump's transition effort and the longtime chief executive of financial services firm Cantor Fitzgerald, Lutnick has been picked to head the Commerce Department, the agency that has become the US weapon of choice against China's tech sector.</p>

<p>A bombastic New Yorker like Trump, Lutnick, 63, has uniformly praised the president-elect's economic policies, including his use of tariffs.</p>

<p>He has at times given elaborate, unvarnished opinions about what policies will be enacted in Trump's second term. Some Trump allies complained privately that he too often presented himself as speaking on behalf of the campaign.</p>

<p><strong>KEVIN WARSH, potential treasury secretary</strong></p>

<p>Trump is considering Warsh, 54, a former investment banker who served on the Federal Reserve Board, for treasury secretary according to news reports. He is seen as a fiscal hawk and proponent of higher savings rates.</p>

<p><strong>MARC ROWAN, potential treasury secretary</strong></p>

<p>Trump is considering Rowan, 62, who co-founded Apollo Global Management and became the firm's CEO in 2021, for treasury secretary, according to news reports.</p>

<p><strong>BILL HAGERTY, potential treasury secretary</strong></p>

<p>Republican US Senator Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, is also in the running for treasury secretary, according to the Wall Street Journal. Trump met the 65-year-old at Mar-a-Lago last week.</p>

<p><strong>SCOTT BESSENT, potential treasury secretary</strong></p>

<p>Bessent, a key economic adviser to Trump, is seen as a candidate for treasury secretary. A longtime hedge fund investor who taught at Yale University for several years, Bessent has a warm relationship with the president-elect.</p>

<p>While Bessent has long favored the laissez-faire policies that were popular in the pre-Trump Republican Party, he has also spoken highly of Trump's use of tariffs as a negotiating tool. He has praised the president-elect's economic philosophy, which rests on a skepticism of both regulations and international trade.</p>

<p><strong>ROBERT LIGHTHIZER, potential trade czar or treasury secretary</strong></p>

<p>A loyalist who served as Trump's US trade representative for essentially the then-president's entire term, Lighthizer will almost certainly be invited back.</p>

<p>Though Bessent likely has a better shot at becoming treasury secretary, Lighthizer has an outside chance, and he might be able to reprise his old role if he's interested.</p>

<p>The Wall Street Journal has reported Trump wanted Lighthizer as his trade czar.</p>

<p>Like Trump, Lighthizer, 77, is a trade skeptic and a firm believer in tariffs. He was one of the leading figures in Trump's trade war with China and the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, with Mexico and Canada during Trump's first term.</p>

<p><strong>LINDA McMAHON, potential candidate for various posts</strong></p>

<p>McMahon, a professional wrestling magnate and former Small Business Administration director, is seen as in the running for a top post in the Trump administration.</p>

<p>McMahon, 76, is a major donor and was an early supporter of the Republican president-elect when he first ran for the White House almost a decade ago. This time, Trump tapped her to co-lead a transition team formed to help vet personnel and draft policy ahead of the Nov. 5 election.</p>

<p>McMahon is the co-founder and former CEO of the professional wrestling franchise WWE. She later served as director of the Small Business Administration, resigning in 2019, and went on to lead a pro-Trump political action committee that supported his 2020 reelection bid.</p>

<p><strong>KASH PATEL, potential candidate for national security posts</strong></p>

<p>A former Republican House staffer who served in various high-ranking staff roles in the defense and intelligence communities during Trump's first term, Patel frequently appeared on the campaign trail to rally support for the candidate.</p>

<p>Any position requiring Senate confirmation may be a challenge, however.</p>

<p>Patel, 44, has leaned into controversy throughout his career. In an interview with Trump ally Steve Bannon last year, he promised to "come after" politicians and journalists perceived to be enemies of Trump.</p>

<p>During Trump's first term, Patel, seen as the ultimate Trump loyalist, drew animosity from some more experienced national security officials, who saw him as volatile and too eager to please the then-president.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ukraine's allies and Russia on Tuesday traded blame for a dramatic escalation in the war in Europe, which dominated the final day of talks at a G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro.</p>

<p>The two-day gathering wrapped up with a plea from Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva for the world's most powerful leaders to rescue stalled UN climate talks in Azerbaijan, calling it a matter of the planet's "survival."</p>

<p>Joe Biden, attending his last summit as US president before he hands power to Donald Trump -- a noted climate skeptic -- also appealed for urgent action.</p>

<p>"History is watching us," he urged.</p>

<p>But Biden's decision to suddenly reverse key US policy on Ukraine in his last weeks in office took away attention from Brazil's anti-poverty, anti-emissions G20 agenda.</p>

<p>On the eve of the gathering, Biden gave Kyiv the green light to use US missiles to strike deep inside Russia for the first time, in apparent response to Moscow enlisting North Korean soldiers to fight in Ukraine.</p>

<p><strong>'Listen to reason'</strong></p>

<p>The move prompted the Kremlin to announce it was loosening its rules on using nuclear weapons, causing alarm among Kyiv's backers in Washington, European capitals and elsewhere.</p>

<p>Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, who was at the G20, declared that the United States and Russia were "on the brink of direct military conflict."</p>

<p>British Prime Minister Keir Starmer criticized the "irresponsible rhetoric coming from Russia," sentiments echoed by a spokesperson for the US National Security Council.</p>

<p>French President Emmanuel Macron said he had asked Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping to "use all his influence" with Russian leader Vladimir Putin to try to get him to "listen to reason."</p>

<p>Xi, who has cast himself as a defender of the international order at the advent of a new Trump era, held back-to-back meetings with other leaders in Rio.</p>

<p>At each turn, the Chinese leader, who was received with greater fanfare than a lame-duck Biden, stressed that the world was facing a new period of "turbulence."</p>

<p>China and Brazil this summer unveiled a plan to get Russia and Ukraine back to the negotiating table, but were rebuffed by Kyiv because Moscow was not required to pull back first.</p>

<p>The summit's joint declaration made no mention of Russian aggression, saying only that the leaders welcomed "all relevant and constructive initiatives that support a comprehensive, just, and durable peace" in Ukraine.</p>

<p><strong>Taxing the uber-rich</strong></p>

<p>President Lula used his summit hosting duties to rally support for a global campaign against hunger and try to spur on the stalled COP29 climate talks in Azerbaijan's capital Baku.</p>

<p>"We cannot leave the task of Baku until Belem," Lula said Tuesday, referring to the Amazonian city that will host next year's UN climate talks.</p>

<p>But a G20 statement on the matter fell short of the shot in the arm sought by climate negotiators gathered in Azerbaijan.</p>

<p>While acknowledging the need for trillions of dollars in climate finance for poorer nations, the leaders failed to explicitly mention the need to transition away from fossil fuels.</p>

<p>Lula said that next year's conference would be the "last chance" to avoid "irreversible" damage wrought by Earth's warming.</p>

<p>Biden, who has been using a valedictory tour of South America to tout his climate legacy, told his G20 counterparts: "I urge us to keep the faith and keep going."</p>

<p>"This is the single greatest existential threat to humanity."</p>

<p>But in a symbol of the elderly leader's imminent disappearance from the global stage, he missed out on the summit's first group photo, his absence going unnoted by his peers.</p>

<p>Another photo was taken Tuesday that Biden featured in.</p>

<p>Lula, who handed over the G20 presidency to fellow Global South advocate South Africa, came away with wins on two pet projects.</p>

<p>The left-winger who grew up in poverty, got the leaders of 80 countries, including a reluctant Argentine President Javier Milei, to join an alliance to end world hunger.</p>

<p>And G20 members, at his urging, also agreed to cooperate to get the world's billionaires to pay more in tax, a key demand of anti-poverty campaigners.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump announced Tuesday that he was appointing Mehmet Oz, a former surgeon and TV celebrity known as "Dr. Oz," to lead the United States' massive public health insurance program.</p>

<p>The 64-year-old heart surgeon was championed on daytime television by Oprah Winfrey before he entered politics with an unsuccessful bid for a Senate seat in 2022.</p>

<p>Oz is the latest of Trump's eye-catching nominations to key positions, including Fox News host Pete Hegseth to be defense secretary, vaccine skeptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as health secretary and billionaire Elon Musk to head a government cost-cutting unit.</p>

<p>"America is facing a Healthcare Crisis and there may be no Physician more qualified and capable than Dr. Oz to Make America Healthy Again," the president-elect posted on his Truth Social platform.</p>

<p>The appointment puts a man whose health recommendations -- especially on Covid and weight loss -- have often been ridiculed by the medical community at the helm of the United States' Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS).</p>

<p>As CMS administrator, Oz will be in charge of a federal agency that provides health coverage to more than 160 million Americans -- almost half the country's population.</p>

<p>It employs about 6,700 people, had outlays of $1.48 trillion last year and is one the largest purchasers of healthcare services in the world.</p>

<p>A son of Turkish immigrants, Oz has never held public office before, but has been a steadfast ally of Trump, who backed him in his unsuccessful Senate run in Pennsylvania.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[SpaceX's Starship megarocket blasted off on its latest test flight Tuesday, with President-elect Donald Trump joining Elon Musk to witness the spectacle firsthand in the latest sign of their ever closer ties.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>SpaceX's Starship megarocket blasted off on its latest test flight Tuesday, with President-elect Donald Trump joining Elon Musk to witness the spectacle firsthand in the latest sign of their ever closer ties.</p>

<p>But the Republican leader was deprived of the chance to see the booster stage caught in the launch tower's "chopstick" arms, an engineering marvel demonstrated by the company last month and one he personally lauded during his election victory speech.</p>

<p>Instead, the colossal Super Heavy first stage made a more subdued splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico. Company representatives cited unmet technical criteria, dampening the triumph of an event attended by a bevy of Trump-world figures, including Donald Trump Jr.</p>

<p>Earlier, Trump greeted Musk warmly on Tuesday afternoon, sporting a red MAGA hat as the pair headed off to watch from the control tower of the company's Starbase in Boca Chica, Texas, where the rocket blasted off at 4:00 pm local time (2200 GMT) on the sixth test flight for Starship.</p>

<p>SpaceX founder and CEO Musk has been a constant presence at Trump's side since the incoming president's election victory, joining him at a meeting with Argentina's President Javier Milei and even at a UFC bout.</p>

<p>Trump's decision to travel to Musk's home turf was the latest sign of the growing alliance between the billionaire duo, which has raised questions over possible conflicts of interests given SpaceX's lucrative contracts with NASA and the Pentagon.</p>

<p>Tuesday's launch marked the quickest turnaround between test flights for the world's most powerful rocket, a gleaming, 121-meter-tall (400-foot) stainless steel colossus central to Musk's ambition of colonizing Mars and making humanity a multiplanetary species.</p>

<p>Musk aims to launch the first uncrewed missions to the Red Planet as early as 2026, coinciding with the next "Mars transfer window" -- a period when the journey between Earth and Mars is at its shortest.</p>

<p>NASA is also counting on a specialized version of Starship to ferry astronauts to the lunar surface later this decade under its Artemis program.</p>

<p><strong>Stuffed banana</strong></p>

<p>Flight six of Starship was seen as a test of whether SpaceX's first booster catch was pure precision or relied on a stroke of luck after Musk -- perhaps inadvertently -- disclosed how close the last flight came to disaster.</p>

<p>In a clip posted to X showcasing his gaming chops in "Diablo IV," sharp-eared fans caught an employee briefing him that the Super Heavy booster was "one second away" from a system failure that could have spelled catastrophe.</p>

<p>Starship's upper stage will make a partial orbit of Earth, reenter the atmosphere and splash down in the Indian Ocean a little over an hour later, but this time in the daylight, providing clearer visuals for analysis.</p>

<p>Key milestones include reigniting Starship's Raptor engines for the first time in space and trialing new heat shield materials. The flight also carries Starship's first ever payload -- a stuffed banana -- and serves as a swan song for the current generation of Starship prototypes.</p>

<p>With twice the thrust of the Saturn V rockets that powered Apollo missions, Starship is the most powerful rocket ever built. Musk has already teased that its successor, Starship V3, will be "3X more powerful" and could take flight within a year.</p>

<p><strong>Musk riding high</strong></p>

<p>The flight comes as Musk is riding high on Trump's November 5 White House win, having campaigned extensively for the returning Republican leader, as well as donating staggering sums from his own fortune to the cause.</p>

<p>His loyalty has paid off. Musk has been tapped to co-lead a new "Department of Government Efficiency" -- or DOGE, a cheeky nod to the meme-based cryptocurrency Musk loves to promote.</p>

<p>That in turn has led to concerns Musk could engage in "self-dealing" as the CEO is poised to straddle the line between government insider and corporate titan.</p>

<p>Critics worry he could sway regulatory decisions to benefit his six companies, including SpaceX and its marquee Starship program, which has faced launch delays linked to an environmental review the company called "superfluous."</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A potential plan to bring in more nations on board the ambitious 6th-generation GCAP jet fighter project was discussed today when the leaders of Italy, Japan and Britain met on the sidelines of the G20 Summit in Brazil, the office of Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Italy, UK and Japan had signed an agreement in December 2022 to collaborate an manufacture an advanced front-line fighter jet to enter service by 2035.</p>

<p>Earlier this month UK PM Keir Starmer and his cabinet gave the approval for the Global Combat Aircraft Programme or GCAP.</p>

<p>The GCAP programme aims to counter a rising threat from Russia and China. The project will merge two different military programs - UK and Italy's Tempest Project</p>

<p>Prime Minister Meloni held a meeting on Tuesday with Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer in Rio de Janeiro where the three leaders discussed various aspects of the project, including bringing in new members on board for the project.</p>

<p>"They agreed on the importance of the project continuing to move forward expeditiously, reaffirming their common intent to further strengthen the ongoing collaboration," the statement said.</p>

<p>The final cost of the multi-billion-dollar project is not known yet, but the target to develop and commission the stealth fighter jet has been set for 2035. The project is being jointly developed by British aircraft manufacturer BAE Systems, engine manufacturer Rolls-Royce, Italy's Leonardo Aerospace, and Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries.</p>

<p>According to the trilateral agreement, the joint GCAP government headquarters will be based in the UK.</p>

<p>If the deadlines are met, the GCAP supersonic, 6th generation stealth fighter aircraft will become only the second such fighter jet in the world after the United States' B-21 Raider Bomber which is manufactured by Northrop Grumman.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For world leaders and diplomats at the G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro, US President-elect Donald Trump was the man who cannot be named.</p>

<p>Almost nobody would mention the next occupant of the White House directly, even as his impending return to power hung over the meeting.</p>

<p>Leaders would instead talk in coded terms about the "next administration," "turbulence" and "change."</p>

<p>But it was clear what they meant, even as they sought to avoid falling out with the man who will be at work in the Oval Office from January 20.</p>

<p>French President Emmanuel Macron, who expended considerable effort trying to win over Trump during the American's first term, made veiled comments at the summit about tariffs and climate.</p>

<p>"Any fragmentation or fracturing of the international order by tariff policies which are carried out by the strongest simply leads all others not to respect it," Macron said -- without referring to Trump by name.</p>

<p>Trump has pledged to impose sweeping tariffs on imports into the United States, including on goods from Europe and as much as 60 percent on goods from China.</p>

<p>Macron also referred to "fragile" climate policies, with Trump threatening to take the United States back out of the Paris accords that are aimed at reducing global warming.</p>

<h2><strong>SWERVE</strong></h2>

<p>It was the same whenever leaders spoke, as they seemingly treated Trump like the villain Voldemort in the Harry Potter films and books, whose name the heroes cannot mention.</p>

<p>UN chief Antonio Guterres swerved any head-on mention of Trump when he talked of the "very important" US role on climate and how he was "deeply confident" that America would "move in the direction of climate action."</p>

<p>The only places Trump's face could be seen were on placards held by protesters outside the summit venue -- and on the social media feed of Argentina's right-wing, Trump-supporting president.</p>

<p>Javier Milei reposted a meme contrasting a photo of himself meeting the smiling Trump at his Mar-a-Lago resort after the election, with another of Milei beside a grim-faced Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.</p>

<p>Behind the scenes, officials were circumspect.</p>

<p>One European diplomat said that the continent had "worked with him before" and would do so again.</p>

<h3><strong>DECISIONS</strong></h3>

<p>US officials insisted time and again that Trump's name did not come up in outgoing President Joe Biden's final meetings with his counterparts, or even that it was a major consideration.</p>

<p>"I don't think we are expecting some major reorientation of how other countries look at the world or look at their relationship with us," Deputy National Security Advisor Jon Finer told reporters.</p>

<p>"They will make those decisions for themselves based on their interests, in January."</p>

<p>Perhaps it was partly out of deference to Biden, making his swan song on the international stage.</p>

<p>Biden himself skirted round the issue -- in fact he has long resisted mentioning the name of the man he often calls "my predecessor," who is now his successor.</p>

<p>The 81-year-old Biden tried to shore up his legacy while his fellow summiteers looked over his shoulder.</p>

<p>As Biden remarked that it was his final summit, he called for leaders to "keep going -- and I'm sure you will, regardless of my urging or not."</p>

<p>On the final day, Biden seemed to realize that the return of he-who-cannot-be named was nigh.</p>

<p>"I have much more to say," Biden said, before stopping himself and adding: "I'm not going to."<br />

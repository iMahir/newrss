       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Nobel Prize in Medicine was awarded on Monday to two US scientists for discovering microRNA, a previously unknown type of genetic switch which is hoped can pave the way for new medical breakthroughs.</p>

<p>But while several treatments and tests are under development using microRNAs against cancer, heart disease, viruses and other illnesses, none have actually yet reached patients.&nbsp;</p>

<p>And the world paid little attention when the new Nobel laureates Victor Ambros and Gary Ruvkun revealed their discovery decades ago, thinking it was just "something weird about worms", Cambridge University geneticist Eric Miska told AFP.</p>

<p>Here is an explainer about how exactly these tiny genetic switches work inside our bodies.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>- What is microRNA? -</strong></p>

<p>Each cell in the human body has the same set of instructions, called DNA. Some turn into brain cells, while others become muscles.</p>

<p>So how do the cells know what to become? The relevant part of the DNA's instructions is pointed to via a process called gene regulation.</p>

<p>Ribonucleic acid (RNA) normally serves as a messenger. It delivers the instructions from the DNA to proteins, which are the building blocks of life that turn cells into brains -- or muscles.</p>

<p>Miska gave the example of the messenger RNA vaccines rolled out against Covid-19 during the pandemic, which insert a message with new instructions to build proteins that block viruses.</p>

<p>But the two new Nobel winners Ambros and Ruvkun discovered a whole new type of gene regulator that had previously been overlooked by science.</p>

<p>Rather than being the messenger which relays information, microRNA instead acts as a switch to turn other genes off and on.</p>

<p>"This was a whole new level of control that we had totally missed," said Miska, who has worked on microRNA for two decades, including with the new Nobel laureates.</p>

<p>"The discovery of microRNAs brought an additional level of complexity by revealing that regions that were thought to be non-coding play a role in gene regulation," French researcher Benoit Ballester told AFP.</p>

<p><strong>- What did the Nobel winners do? -</strong></p>

<p>Back in the 1980s, Ambros and Ruvkun had been working separately on how genes interact in one-millimetre-long roundworms called C.elegans.</p>

<p>When they compared their work, it led to the discovery of microRNA. Ambros revealed the finding in a 1993 paper.</p>

<p>"Nobody really paid much attention," Miska said, explaining that most scientists at the time thought it only applied to worms.</p>

<p>Then in 2000, Ruvkun published research showing that microRNA is present right across the animal kingdom, including in humans and even some viruses.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"This was not just something weird that worms do, but in fact all animals and plants are totally dependent for development and normal function on them," Miska said.</p>

<p>More than a thousand genes that respond to microRNAs are now believed to be in the human body.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>- How could this help us? -</strong></p>

<p>There are numerous new treatments and tests using microRNA that are undergoing trials but none have been made widely available.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Though there are no very clear applications available yet in microRNAs, understanding them, knowing that they exist, understanding their counter-regulatory networks, is always the first step," the Karolinska Institute's Gunilla Karlsson Hedestam told journalists in Stockholm.</p>

<p>MicroRNAs are particularly promising for fighting cancer because some of these switches "act as a tumour suppressor, so they put a brake on cells dividing inappropriately," Miska said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Others, meanwhile, induce "cells to divide, which can lead to cancer", he added.</p>

<p>Because many viruses use microRNAs, several antiviral drugs are at varying stages of development, including for hepatitis C.</p>

<p>One complicating factor has been that microRNAs can be unstable.</p>

<p>But scientists also hope they can be used as a test called a "biomarker", which could reveal what type of cancer a patient could be suffering from, for example.</p>

<p><strong>- What next? -</strong></p>

<p>It also appears probable that microRNAs could be involved in the evolution of our species, Miska said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"It seems very likely that microRNAs have important roles in why the human brain is different from the brains of other primates," Miska said.</p>

<p>While human brains are difficult to study, Miska hoped future research would discover more.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A revolutionary hypersonic jet, capable of flying from London to New York in just one hour, is set to take to the skies for its inaugural test flight in 2025. Developed by startup engineering company Venus Aerospace, this futuristic plane will reach astonishing speeds of up to Mach 6 (3,600mph/5,795km/h),&nbsp;which is six times the speed of sound. According to a report by <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://metro.co.uk/2024/10/07/hypersonic-jet-can-reach-speeds-3-600mph-take-test-flight-2025-21744504/#:~:text=The%20Venus%20Detonation%20Ramjet%202000,miles)%20in%20just%20one%20hour." rel="nofollow, noindex">Metro</a></em>, the Venus Detonation Ramjet 2000 lb Thrust Engine, or VDR2, is the powerhouse behind this breakthrough, enabling hypersonic flight.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In partnership with aerospace company Velontra, Venus Aerospace plans to conduct the test flight next year, paving the way for the "high-speed flight economy." Unlike traditional aircraft, this hypersonic jet will fly higher than traditional aircraft, utilising conventional jet engines for takeoff before transitioning to rocket propulsion at altitude. Although not technically reaching the edge of space, passengers will witness breathtaking views of the Earth's curvature and the darkness of space above.</p>

<p>Unveiling the new engine at the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/17947070029975807/?hl=en">Up. Summit</a>, Venus Aerospace co-founder Andrew Duggleby said, ''This engine makes the hypersonic economy a reality.&nbsp;We are excited to partner with Velontra to achieve this revolution in high-speed flight, given their expertise in high-speed air combustion.''</p>

<p>Eric Briggs, Velontra's Chief Operating Officer, said, ''We can't wait to dig in, make the first one fly, and ultimately perfect an engine concept that has lived mostly in textbooks but never as a production unit in the air. We couldn't think of a better partner than Venus. Rocketry pioneers in their own right, and ready to tackle the hard problems, we are eager to fly the same path with them.''</p>

<p>The hypersonic aviation landscape is heating up, with multiple players racing to develop revolutionary aircraft. Sierra Space and Hermeus are also joining Venus Aerospace in the pursuit of Mach 6-capable planes. Meanwhile, China's Space Transportation is working on a "rocket with wings" for space tourism and intercity travel.</p>

<p>These innovative aircraft will transform the flying experience, offering unprecedented speed and efficiency. However, challenges remain, such as managing sonic boom noise and ensuring safety.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has declared 51 of the state's 67 counties under a state of emergency, predicting Hurricane Milton could have "major, major impacts".]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Survivors of deadly Hurricane Helene along the Florida coast were ordered to evacuate again on Monday as authorities warned another major storm was building into a Category 3 and would cause "devastating damage".</p>

<p>Relief workers in the area are still racing to find survivors in the aftermath of Helene, which killed more than 225 people across a handful of states.</p>

<p>Storm surge warnings were issued once again for parts of Florida as Milton, currently a Category 1, approached with winds of 100 miles (161 kilometers) an hour, the US National Hurricane Center said in its latest advisory Monday.</p>

<p>Tampa Mayor Jane Castor told CNN that the city was "still cleaning up from Helene" and that the rain from the new storm would be "difficult enough, not to mention the storm surge and wind damage."</p>

<p>Milton "is forecast to intensify rapidly and become a major hurricane later today," and was expected to hit Florida's west coast on Wednesday, the NHC said.</p>

<p>Major hurricanes -- categories 3 and above -- carry minimum wind speeds of 111 miles (178 kilometers) an hour, according to the NHC, which warns "devastating damage will occur" to even well-built homes, while "electricity and water will be unavailable for several days to weeks after the storm passes."</p>

<p>Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has declared 51 of the state's 67 counties under a state of emergency, predicting Milton could have "major, major impacts."</p>

<p>President Joe Biden was briefed on Milton and said in a statement his administration was readying "life-saving resources."</p>

<p>Milton is forecast to move north of the Yucatan Peninsula and across the southern Gulf of Mexico Monday and Tuesday, the NHC said.</p>

<p>Its storm surge will "raise water levels by as much as 2 to 4 feet (0.6 to 1.2 meters) above ground level" along the northern Yucatan coast and cause "large and destructive waves," it said Monday.</p>

<p><strong>Disinformation blitz</strong></p>

<p>Hurricane Helene hit the Florida coastline as a Category 4 storm, dumping torrential rainfall and causing flash flooding in remote towns in states such as North Carolina.</p>

<p>The storm, which struck Florida on September 26, was the deadliest natural disaster to hit the United States since 2005's Hurricane Katrina -- with the toll still rising.</p>

<p>Communities, particularly those in remote mountainous areas, have been left without power and drinking water.</p>

<p>However, relief efforts have been hit by a wave of false claims and conspiracy theories.</p>

<p>Among the litany of disinformation is the falsehood pushed by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump that relief funds have been misappropriated by his rival for the White House, Democrat Kamala Harris, and redirected toward migrants.</p>

<p>The head of the US disaster relief agency has lashed out at a "dangerous" misinformation war being waged over the aftermath.</p>

<p>"It's frankly ridiculous and just plain false ... it's really a shame that we're putting politics ahead of helping people," Deanne Criswell, head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), told ABC.</p>

<p>The Trump campaign nevertheless doubled down, repeating the assertion in a statement Sunday.</p>

<p>FEMA and outside fact-checkers note that a program under the agency's aegis to provide shelter and aid to migrants is funded directly by Congress, entirely separate from disaster-related funding.</p>

<p>ABC reported that law enforcement officials are monitoring threats toward FEMA officials and other recovery agencies prompted by the disinformation.</p>

<p>In addition to Trump's false claim, the Washington Post reported Sunday on other lies about Helene that it said were "adding to the chaos and confusion."</p>

<p>They include a false claim that a dam was about to burst, which the Post said prompted hundreds of people to evacuate unnecessarily, and a "troubling" lie that officials planned to bulldoze bodies under the rubble in one North Carolina town.</p>

<p>One user suggested "a militia go against fema" in a post on social media platform X that has received more than half a million views.</p>

<p>Asked about that post, Criswell said it "has a tremendous impact on the comfort level of our own employees to be able to go out there."</p>

<p>FEMA has begun debunking the rumors online, as have North Carolina authorities.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US scientist Gary Ruvkun, who on Monday won the Nobel Prize in Medicine with fellow American Victor Ambros for their discovery of microRNA, said winning the honour was like "an earthquake".</p>

<p>"It's a big deal. It's a big one. It's an earthquake," the 72-year-old professor at Harvard Medical School told Swedish public radio SR just after the announcement was made in Stockholm.</p>

<p>He was woken by a call from the Nobel prize committee in the early hours of Monday in the United States.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The dog is confused by why it's dark outside and we are running around the house," laughed Ruvkun.</p>

<p>He said he looked forward to attending the Nobel gala in Stockholm on December 10, when the laureates receive their prizes from Sweden's King Carl XVI Gustaf.</p>

<p>He said he had already attended the ceremony "a few times".</p>

<p>"It's a party. You don't think of a bunch of scientists as party animals but we really are."</p>

<p>The Nobel committee failed however to reach Ambros, who learned the news from an SR reporter who called and broke the news.</p>

<p>"Wow, that's incredible! I didn't know that," the 70-year-old professor at the University of Massachusetts medical school said, adding: "Good. Wonderful."</p>

<p>The Nobel Prize consists of a diploma, a gold medal and a $1 million cheque to be shared by the pair.</p>

<p>Collaborating but working separately, they discovered microRNA, a new class of tiny RNA molecules that play a crucial role in gene regulation, which in turn allows each cell to select only relevant instructions.</p>

<p>Gene regulation that goes wrong can lead to serious diseases, such as cancer or diabetes.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[For Hamas, the hostages are key bargaining chips in negotiations with Israel aiming to secure a truce and the release of Palestinian prisoners.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When Hamas militants staged the worst-ever attack on Israel on October 7 last year, they took 251 hostages into the Gaza Strip. Some were already dead.&nbsp;On the first anniversary, Israel believes 63 people, including two children, are still alive, while 34 are confirmed dead but remain in Gaza.</p>

<p>For Hamas, which rules Gaza, the hostages are key bargaining chips in negotiations with Israel aiming to secure a truce and the release of Palestinian prisoners.</p>

<p>Here is what we know about the hostages still held in Gaza.</p>

<p><strong>- 51 men, 10 women, two children -</strong></p>

<p>Of the 251 hostages seized by militants on October 7, 2023, 117 have been freed, most of them women, children and foreign workers.</p>

<p>Most were released during a week-long truce in November in exchange for 240 Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.</p>

<p>Nearly a year later, Israel believes 63 hostages still held in Gaza are alive.</p>

<p>The army and the Hostages and Missing Families Forum have confirmed 71 others are dead, 34 of whose bodies are still in Gaza. The death of Idan Shtivi was announced on Monday by the Forum.</p>

<p>The military has repatriated the bodies of 37 hostages who either died in Gaza or were killed on October 7 and taken to the territory.</p>

<p>Of the 63 thought to be alive, 56 are Israelis, though some of them have more than one nationality. Another six are Thais and one is Nepalese.</p>

<p>Fifty-one are men and 10 are women. Eleven are military personnel.</p>

<p>Two are children.</p>

<p>The youngest hostage, Kfir Bibas, was just eight-and-a-half months old when he was kidnapped. His brother Ariel was four years old when he was taken to Gaza.</p>

<p>Hamas has said the two children are dead, but Israel has not confirmed this.</p>

<p><strong>- No proof of life -</strong></p>

<p>Since the last truce ended on December 1, seven other hostages have been freed alive, all during Israeli military operations.</p>

<p>With no proof of life, it remains uncertain whether the 63 are still alive.</p>

<p>Hamas's armed wing said on August 12 that its fighters had shot and killed an Israeli hostage and wounded two others.</p>

<p>Hamas has announced on several occasions deaths of hostages that Israel has yet to confirm, leaving families in agonising limbo.</p>

<p><strong>- Bodies taken to Gaza -</strong></p>

<p>On October 7, 2023, Hamas militants took several dead back into Gaza with them, including the bodies of 10 Israeli soldiers.</p>

<p>At least 28 other hostages have died in the territory since the start of the war.</p>

<p>Three were killed in error by the Israeli army on December 15, 2023. They were Yotam Haim, 28, Samer El-Talalqa and Alon Shamriz, 26.</p>

<p>The Israeli army accuses Hamas of executing six others in August: Hersh Goldberg-Polin, Carmel Gat, Eden Yerushalmi, Alexander Lobonov, Almog Sarusi and Ori Danino.</p>

<p>They were found dead by soldiers in a tunnel in Rafah, in southern Gaza.</p>

<p><strong>- Festival, kibbutz survivors -</strong></p>

<p>Most of the hostages were taken during the attacks on the Nir Oz kibbutz and the Nova music festival.</p>

<p>At Nir Oz kibbutz, of the at least 76 hostages taken on October 7, 40 were released alive. Another 20 are still in Gaza and believed to be alive. The remaining 16 are dead.</p>

<p>Sixteen people abducted from the festival are thought to be alive and still held in Gaza.</p>

<p>Only nine of at least 43 hostages taken from Nova have been released, while 18 others have died.</p>

<p><strong>- Whole families -</strong></p>

<p>On October 7, whole families were taken to Gaza. For them, the November 2023 truce brought relief but also the heartache of leaving loved ones behind.</p>

<p>French-Israeli children Eitan, Erez and Sahar were freed but their fathers Ohad Yahalomi and Ofer Kalderon are still held.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A shocking incident unfolded in Texas on October 3 when police responded to a 911 call about a suspicious person at an under-construction home in Garden Ridge. Upon arrival, deputies from the Comal County Sheriff's Office made a disturbing discovery - 51-year-old Jennifer Massey, an art teacher at Davenport High School, was found inside with a male juvenile student. The situation quickly escalated, leading to Massey's arrest. Authorities confirmed that Massey was caught having sex with the minor student.&nbsp;The age of the male student was not immediately known.</p>

<p>Massey was charged with improper relationship between educator and student, a second-degree felony, and is being held at the Comal County Jail, as per the <em><u><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/10/07/us-news/texas-teacher-51-caught-having-sex-in-under-construction-home/" rel="nofollow, noindex">New York Post.&nbsp;</a></u></em>If convicted, she faces up to 20 years in prison and a $10,000 fine.</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" height="776" scrolling="no" src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FCOMALCOUNTYSO%2Fposts%2Fpfbid02krHZAhjSn2SXGddi9vL1ctKwJobTkcNYYW97a7UbAvg6iWJ9rJbFLoy73oDjeFnrl&amp;show_text=true&amp;width=500" style="border:none;overflow:hidden" width="500"></iframe></p>

<p></p>

<p>Comal Independent School District responded to the allegations against Jennifer Massey, condemning the suspected misconduct and placing her on leave. In a statement to <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.kens5.com/article/news/crime/high-teacher-sexual-contact-student-garden-ridge-texas/273-481d64e5-4714-4799-b46d-8d9eaff00ea8" rel="nofollow, noindex">KENS 5,</a></em> the district emphasized, "We do not tolerate inappropriate relationships between teachers and students. Student safety and security are our utmost priority."</p>

<p>Comal ISD also pledged full cooperation with law enforcement during the ongoing investigation. Additionally, the district sent a notification to parents on Friday, reassuring them of their commitment to student well-being.</p>

<aside>
<p>"The district learned that last night Mrs. Massey was charged with having an improper relationship with a student.&nbsp;Mrs. Massey was placed on administrative leave this morning, and she will not be returning to Davenport High School," the message said.</p>

<p>The principal of Davenport High School also issued a letter to parents on Friday informing them that the teacher&nbsp;was placed on administrative leave and will not be returning to the school.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The disturbing phenomenon of teachers engaging in illegal sexual relationships with students is a growing concern in the United States. According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ferretly.com/blog/teacher-student-sexual-misconduct-the-critical-role-of-social-media-screening">recent reports</a>, there were over 500 reported cases of teacher misconduct between 2014 and 2019, with nearly 1 in 10 students experiencing some form of sexual misconduct by an educator. Several factors contribute to this alarming trend, including increased reporting and awareness, social media facilitating inappropriate interactions, breakdowns in teacher-student boundaries, inadequate screening and hiring practices, and insufficient teacher training on ethics and boundaries.</p>

<p>Last month, a 26-year-old former high school math teacher in Missouri, US, pleaded guilty to felony sexual contact with a 16-year-old student. Hailey Clifton-Carmack was arrested in January for her relationship with the student, which included having sex in a driveway while other students served as "lookouts," reported&nbsp;<em><a href="https://people.com/hailey-clifton-carmack-missouri-teacher-pleads-guilty-felony-sexual-contact-student-8709913%C2%A0">People magazine</a>.</em> She is currently under house arrest as she awaits her sentencing on October 11.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>"God save the Tsar!" was one of the first public birthday wishes for President Vladimir Putin who turns 72 on Monday and who has been Russia's paramount leader for nearly quarter of a century.</p>

<p>The greeting came from ultra-nationalist Russian ideologue Alexander Dugin on his Telegram messaging channel minutes after midnight.</p>

<p>Dugin, 62, has long advocated the unification of Russian-speaking and other territories in a vast new Russian empire, which he wants to include Ukraine, where Russia has been waging a war. Dugin's daughter was killed in a suspected car bomb in 2022.</p>

<p>Putin, who ordered his troops to invade Ukraine in 2022, won a record post-Soviet landslide in a March election. His new six-year term, if completed, would make him Russia's longest-serving leader for more than 200 years when tsars and empresses ruled the country.</p>

<p>The victory cemented Putin's already tight grip on power and, he said, showed Moscow had been right to stand up to the West and send its troops into Ukraine.</p>

<p>The West casts Putin as an autocrat and a killer. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy called the March vote that extended the rule of the former KGB spy illegitimate.</p>

<p>Putin portrays the war in Ukraine as part of a centuries-old battle with a declining West which he says humiliated Russia after the Cold War by encroaching on Moscow's sphere of influence.</p>

<p>Kyiv and its Western allies call the war an imperialistic land grab. The conflict has killed thousands of civilians, the vast majority of them Ukrainians. It has turned cities into rubble and displaced millions.</p>

<p>"Today, friends is the birthday of our national leader," Ramzan Kadyrov, the leader of Russia's Chechen Republic who calls himself Putin's "foot soldier," wrote in a congratulatory message on Telegram at midnight on Monday.</p>

<p>"This is a significant day for our entire Fatherland."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Last year's October 7 terror attacks by Hamas unleashed carnage on ordinary civilians, the aftermath of which continues to this day. Today marks one year since that fateful morning. Both the attack by a non-state actor and the state response to it were unprecedented in terms of their sheer scope, firepower and destruction. Gaza has been flattened out, with millions of people internally displaced within a narrow Gaza strip. Israel, too, has lost some 1,200 civilians and soldiers; this is in addition to over 250 people who were taken hostage by Hamas on October 7.</p>

<p>Many forget that the date of the Hamas attack also marked the 50th anniversary of the Yom Kippur War. The gravity of the day and the need to beef up security should not have been lost on Mossad, the Shin Bet and the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). But perhaps Israel was overconfident. So when the agencies were caught unawares, Benjamin Netanyahu, heading Israel's ultra-right government, naturally vowed to destroy Hamas, with only one goal in mind: reoccupation of Gaza.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>The World Has Failed To Understand The Conflict</strong></h2>

<p>However, despite the carpet bombing of Palestine and the assassination of a number of Hamas militants and leaders, the group survives a year on. It continues to hold around 100 hostages captive even now, hoping to use them as leverage for a permanent ceasefire and release of their prisoners from Israeli jails. But Netanyahu is in no mood for negotiation. Already, he has extended his tenure to escape legal action, in the process subjecting himself to International Court of Justice (ICJ) rulings and International Criminal Court (warrants). Those things matter little to him though - if anything, Netanyahu seems to be wearing this international criticism as a medal of honour.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The international community's approach to resolving the conflict has been flawed since the very beginning. The focus has always been on avoiding the escalation and expansion of the war without showing much commitment towards addressing the root cause of the tensions, including the Palestinian issue. Iran and Israel both suffer from the Mutual Assured Destruction (MAD) syndrome, that is, in case of conflict, they'd strive for each other's complete destruction. Iran's quest for nuclear parity with Israel and its asymmetrical advantage and influence exercised through its proxies, the three or four 'H's - Hamas in Gaza and Palestine, Hezbollah in Lebanon and Syria, Houthis and Kataib Hezbollah in Iraq - have been a constant source of worry for the Jewish state as well as its benefactors in the West, especially the US.</p>

<h2><strong>The 'Neutrality' Of Arab Countries</strong></h2>

<p>Even Arab countries in the region are wary of Iranian power pursuits and projections - which is why, even as many nations continue their rapprochement with Iran, the ongoing Israeli campaign against its proxies does not raise many eyebrows. This was evident during the recent Iran-Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) meeting in Doha, where the new Iranian President, Masoud Pezeshkian, met the Qatari Emir and Foreign Ministers of GCC countries. The Foreign Minister of Saudi Arabia forthrightly claimed that his country was committed to resolving all differences with Iran. "We seek to close the page of differences between the two countries forever and work towards the resolution of our issues and expansion of our relations like two friendly and brotherly states," he said.</p>

<p>The Gulf countries also assured Iran of their neutrality in the ongoing war and stated that they would not allow US bases to operate against Iran. How that will play out is a million-dollar question, given how many of these countries recently closed their airspaces; in fact, the missiles Iran fired at Israel recently were neutralised by the US airbase in Jordan.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Why Iran Responded With Force</strong></h2>

<p>In April, the bombing of the Iranian mission in Damascus led to a calibrated exchange of missiles and attacks and counter-attacks. Post that, Tehran was persuaded not to retaliate to the killing of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh since a ceasefire deal had been in the offing. The new, somewhat moderate, President of Iran, has been keen to reopen channels of communication with the West and the US, including its nuclear files, which explains the "strategic restraint and patience" Iran showed initially.</p>

<p>But with the shocking execution of the Hamas and Hezbollah's political and military leadership, including Hassan Nasrallah in Lebanon, the Iranian regime was left with little choice but to respond, lest it be seen as a mere Paper Tiger by its people and proxies. Hence, on October 1, it fired some 181 missiles, most of which were intercepted by the US and others, though some did penetrate Israeli territory, hitting Mossad and military establishments. Of course, the information of this operation is said to have been shared through common interlocutors.</p>

<h2><strong>The 'Oil' Factor</strong></h2>

<p>Netanyahu has called this escalation a direct attack by Iran and has vowed to respond and retaliate at a time and place of its choosing. Reports indicate that Tel Aviv wants to attack Iranian nuclear installations - it had done so earlier too, though clandestinely - but US President Biden is not in favour of this. Instead, they are reportedly planning to target a few oil installations and refineries. Already, oil prices have shot up by over $8 per barrel and may even breach the steady band, impacting several economies, including India.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As such, Israel is engaged on several fronts simultaneously, including Gaza, Lebanon, Syria, the West Bank, Iraq and Iran. Iraqi militia groups have also used UAVs and missiles to attack Israeli positions, stating that any attacks on Iranian fields will deprive the world of oil supplies from others.</p>

<p>As of now, the IDF's main priority in Lebanon is the elimination of Hezbollah. Heavy clashes have been reported from southern Lebanon, forcing nearly a million Lebanese and Syrian refugees to flee for safety. Israel feels that the relentless attacks by Hezbollah across the border into Northern Isreal were putting its sovereignty at risk, with over 70,000 displaced Israelis unable to return to their homes. But even in leaning towards this logic, it fails to realise the consequences of what is happening in Gaza to a 20 times bigger Palestinian population, being flung around from place to place under inhumane conditions. The Lebanese army has also been dragged into the war and has responded to attacks as it continues to urge adherence to the UNSC Resolution 1701.</p>

<h2><strong>World Watches With Bated Breath</strong></h2>

<p>The international community has expressed deep concern at the deteriorating situation in Lebanon as intense firing continues across the Blue Line and areas observed by the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) are breached. Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati also continues to urge for the implementation of a 21-day ceasefire proposed by the US and France and the provision of uninterrupted humanitarian and relief supplies as his country has been already reeling under deep political uncertainty and financial crunch. Meanwhile, the Iranian Foreign Minister on his recent visits to Beirut and Damascus promised humanitarian support and assured the disjointed Hezbollah and Hamas of their full assistance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Although G7 leaders have condemned Iran's missile attacks, they have issued a statement that there is a need for cessation of hostilities as soon as possible to create space for a diplomatic solution along the Blue Line. The Arab League also expressed its concern and full support for Lebanon. As for Iran, it now appears to have abdicated its strategic restraint and has maintained that though it did not want to escalate the war, an attack by Israel would force it to respond in an unconventional manner. A rare Friday sermon by Ayatollah Khamenei underlined that sentiment. Some even argue that with its nuclear enrichment at threshold levels, Iran is capable of building small nuclear weapons in a much shorter duration. And if Israel chooses to target in its next strike Iranian missile storages, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps headquarters, air or sea bases, or nuclear or oil and gas facilities, then that could push Iran to even block the Strait of Hormuz, further choking maritime trade and hydrocarbons transit.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Things May Turn Complicated For India, Too</strong></h2>

<p>India has been urging restraint and resolution of the conflict through dialogue and diplomacy. Three of its ships remain in Iranian ports for some exercises. Indian naval assets have also been guarding sea lanes and commercial shipping since the Houthis attacked vessels in the Red Sea. New Delhi shares a close relationship with both Iran and Israel. The region - India's extended neighbourhood - is critical as any instability and security deficit will mean a risk to the three 'E's - economy, energy supplies and the welfare of roughly 9 million expats.</p>

<p>As things stand, unless sanity prevails on all sides, we are heading irreversibly into an abyss of disaster that's being facilitated, primarily, by the absence of any effective multilateral deterrence.&nbsp;</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Scientists Victor Ambros and Gary Ruvkun won the 2024 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for the discovery of microRNA and its role in gene regulation, the award-giving body said on Monday.</p>

<p>The winners for medicine are selected by the Nobel Assembly of Sweden's Karolinska Institute Medical University and receive a prize sum of 11 million Swedish crowns ($1.1 million).</p>

<p>As every year, the medicine prize is the first in the crop of Nobels, arguably the most prestigious prizes in science, literature and humanitarian endeavour, with the remaining five set to be unveiled over the coming days.</p>

<p>Created in the will of Swedish dynamite inventor and businessman Alfred Nobel, the prizes have been awarded for breakthroughs in science, literature and peace since 1901, while economics is a later addition.</p>

<p>Different institutions award the prizes in the various fields, with Peace being the only one awarded in Oslo rather than Stockholm, possibly as a result of the political union that existed between the two Nordic countries when Nobel penned his will.</p>

<p>Last year's medicine prize was awarded to the runaway favourites Katalin Kariko, a Hungarian scientist, and U.S. colleague Drew Weissman, for discoveries that paved the way for COVID-19 vaccines that helped curb the pandemic.</p>

<p>Past winners of the Nobel medicine prize include many famous researchers such as Ivan Pavlov in 1904, most known for his experiments on behaviour using dogs, and Alexander Fleming, who shared the 1945 prize for the discovery of penicillin.</p>

<p>Steeped in tradition, the science, literature and economics prizes are presented to the laureates in a ceremony on Dec. 10, the anniversary of Alfred Nobel's death, followed by a lavish banquet at Stockholm city hall. Separate festivities attend the winner of the peace prize in Oslo on the same day.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Japan's government admitted Monday manipulating an official photo of the new cabinet to make its members look less unkempt, after online mockery of their sagging trousers.</p>

<p>Images taken by local media showed what appeared to be an untidy patch of white shirt under the morning suits of Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and Defence Minister Gen Nakatani.</p>

<p>In the official photo issued by Ishiba's office, these blemishes had mysteriously disappeared, but not quickly enough to stop a barrage of mockery of the "untidy cabinet" on social media.</p>

<p>"This is more hideous than a group picture of some kind of a seniors' club during a trip to a hot spring. It's utterly embarrassing", one user wrote on X.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Minor editing was made," top government spokesman Yoshimasa Hayashi told reporters on Monday, while seeking to deflect criticism of the manipulation.</p>

<p>"Group photos during official events of the prime minister's office, such as the cabinet reshuffle, will be preserved forever as memorabilia, so minor editing is customarily performed on these photos," he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In March, Catherine, Britain's Princess of Wales, apologised and said she had edited a photo with her children released by the palace.</p>

<p>The Mother's Day portrait of a smiling Kate included several inconsistencies and sparked a storm after major news agencies including AFP withdrew the photo saying it had been manipulated.</p>

<p>"Like many amateur photographers, I do occasionally experiment with editing," Kate said in a statement.</p>

<p>&nbsp;"I wanted to express my apologies for any confusion the family photograph we shared yesterday caused."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday underlined New Delhi's position as a "close friend" of the Maldives and emphasised his government's readiness to respond to medical and economic emergencies as part of its 'neighbourhood first' foreign policy.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="http://www.ndtv.com/topic/india" target="_blank">India</a> and <a class="sp_lnk2" href="http://www.ndtv.com/topic/maldives" target="_blank">Maldives</a> on Monday sought to reset - boosted by a US$400 million - Rs 3,000 crore currency swap deal - a relationship fractured by two diplomatic squabbles over the past 12 months, including last year when three Maldivian ministers made critical comments about <a class="sp_lnk2" href="http://www.ndtv.com/topic/pm-modi" target="_blank">Prime Minister Narendra Modi</a>.</p>

<p>The deal was announced as Maldives&nbsp;<a class="sp_lnk2" href="http://www.ndtv.com/topic/mohamed-muizzu" target="_blank">President Mohamed Muizzu</a>&nbsp;made his first State visit to India.</p>

<p>Mr Muizzu arrived in Delhi Sunday evening and, after a day's rest, was accorded a ceremonial welcome by President Droupadi Murmu and the Prime Minister at Raj Bhavan, after which he paid tribute to Mahatma Gandhi at Rajghat and then went into a huddle with Mr Modi.</p>

<p>At a joint statement after the two leaders met, Mr Modi underlined New Delhi's position as a "close friend" of the island nation, emphasising his 'neighbourhood first' foreign policy that has seen India act as a 'first responder' to emergencies affecting Male, including supplying Covid vaccines.</p>

<p>"Be it essential commodities, vaccines during Covid, or drinking water... we have played a good neighbour," he said, adding India had today also virtually inaugurated the Hanimaadhoo International Airport on the Haa Dhaalu Atoll and, earlier, handed over 700 social housing units, as well as set up a drinking water and sewerage project to serve nearly 30,000 people across 28 Maldivian islands.</p>

<p>The Maldives, the PM then said, also has an important role - to help ensure the security of the Indian Ocean Region. This is an issue that was red-flagged by many within the government after Mr Muizzu - seen as a 'pro-China' leader - won last year's election on what was called an 'India out' platform.</p>

<p>That platform included requesting Delhi to withdraw 90 military personnel in the Maldives to maintain and operate three aviation platforms for humanitarian and medical aid.</p>

<p>These three - two helicopters and a Dornier aircraft - were a gift from India.</p>

<p>After talks, Delhi replaced military personnel with "competent technical" staff.</p>

<p>Apart from the ejection of the military staff - of which Mr Muizzu has said he simply "did what the people of Maldives asked of me" -&nbsp;February's docking of a Chinese spy ship masquerading as a research vessel also raised eyebrows after similar vessels docked at Sri Lanka's Hambantota Port.</p>

<p><strong>READ |&nbsp;</strong><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/maldives-president-mohamed-muizzi-india-visit-wont-do-anything-to-undermine-security-of-india-maldives-president-6732730#pfrom=home-ndtv_topscroll" target="_blank">Maldives President's Diplomatic U-turn, Appeal To Indian Tourists</a></p>

<p>On these points, and the claimed 'India Out' agenda, which was seen as one of Mr Muizzu's key poll promises, he insisted India remains a key partner in his efforts to secure regional stability and denied any 'India out' agenda. He said it was simply the case that "Maldives does not want a foreign soldier".</p>

<h3><strong>$400 Million, Rs 3,000 Crore Currency Swap</strong></h3>

<p>Meanwhile, as part of resetting of ties, India and the Maldives announced a currency swap - a financial agreement that sees two parties exchange the principal and interest of a loan in different currencies over a set period of time - to help Male overcome foreign exchange reserve issues.</p>

<p>This is seen as critical as Delhi looks to ward off China's influence over Male and in the Indian Ocean Region, which includes Sri Lanka. India has also granted a US$100 million rollover of Treasury bills.</p>

<p>"I am also thankful for India's decision to provide support - Rs 30 billion in addition to US$ 400 million bilateral currency swap - which will be instrumental in addressing forex issues right now," he said.</p>

<p>Other bilateral measures announced are the launch of the RuPay card issued by the National Payments Corporation of India, a financial services firmed owned by a consortium of Indian banks.</p>

<p>India is also assisting the Maldives with an infrastructure project for the Greater Male area.</p>

<p>Overall, both sides seem satisfied with the outcome of Mr Muizzu's first bilateral visit to this country, the agreements signed and comments made reflect the growing bonhomie after the diplomatic spats.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Despite his unwavering forecast for Kamala Harris, Dr Allan Lichtman emphasised the importance of voter participation. "The outcome is up to you, so get out and vote," he urged.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A prominent presidential historian, Dr Allan Lichtman, has reiterated his prediction that Vice President Kamala Harris will win the 2024 presidential election against former President Donald Trump, dismissing concerns about an "October surprise" affecting the outcome.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dr Lichtman, a professor at American University and renowned for accurately forecasting nine of the last ten US elections, made his prediction early in September.</p>

<p>In an interview with<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/10/05/politics/video/smerconish-commentary-october-surprise-digvid"> CNN's Michael Smerconish</a>, Dr Lichtman stated, "One of the greatest myths of American politics is the October surprise. I have never changed my prediction in response to an October surprise because the keys gauge the big picture of incumbent governance in strength and don't sway by the events of the campaign."</p>

<p>Dr Lichtman's "keys" refer to a system of 13 categories he uses to assess each candidate's viability for the presidency. In September, he said Mrs Harris holds an advantage in eight of the 13 keys, while Trump secured three.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Historically, Dr Lichtman's assertion about the insignificance of "October surprises" is supported by precedent. In the lead-up to the 2016 election, a leaked "Access Hollywood" tape revealed Trump making controversial remarks about women. Despite the fallout, Trump ultimately won the election, a prediction Lichtman had made based on his key system.</p>

<p>"I've never changed a prediction in 40 years, and I'm not doing it now," Lichtman affirmed. The scholar, who identifies as a registered Democrat, claims to have accurately predicted the outcome of every presidential race since 1984. However, some critics highlight inconsistencies in his rationale over the years, particularly regarding the 2000 and 2016 elections.</p>

<p>Despite his unwavering forecast for Harris, Dr Lichtman emphasised the importance of voter participation. "The outcome is up to you, so get out and vote," he urged.</p>

<p>Recent polling data shows Mrs Harris with a narrow lead over Donald Trump, holding a two-percentage point advantage in multi-candidate polls, according to the latest RealClearPolitics aggregate.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As the election approaches, all eyes will be on whether Dr Lichtman's predictions hold true.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Israel is fighting a "long war", the country's military chief told its soldiers and commanders a day ahead of the first anniversary of the 2023 Hamas attack, vowing to wipe out its "enemies" who seek to destroy Israel.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel is fighting a "long war", the country's military chief told its soldiers and commanders a day ahead of the first anniversary of the 2023 Hamas attack, vowing to wipe out its "enemies" who seek to destroy Israel. Lieutenant General Herzi Halevi, Chief of the General Staff of Israel, praised their commitment and courage as the Middle East stared at uncertainty, plunging into more violence by the day. He asserted every day was becoming worse for their "enemies".</p>

<p>"This is a long war, measured not only by capabilities but also by willpower and perseverance over time. For our enemies - every month, every week, and every day is worse than the one before," the army chief said in his message.</p>

<p>Hamas, a Palestinian group that runs Gaza, launched an unprecedented attack on Israeli border towns on October 7, 2023, massacring over a thousand civilians. They called their attack the 'Al-Aqsa Flood', named after a holy site in Jerusalem that remains a bone of contention for Israel and Palestine and is believed to be sacred by both Jews and Muslims. The attack sparked the ongoing West Asia conflict.</p>

<p>Israel marked the war anniversary with vigils at massacre sites while Hamas said the attack shattered the "illusion" of superiority that Israel had.</p>

<p>"A year has passed since October 7th, the day we failed in our mission to protect the citizens of the State of Israel," said the Lieutenant General on Sunday. After the war ends, Halevi said, the enemies of Israel will know there will be no revival for those who seek to destroy the country.</p>

<p>The army chief further said a generation of warriors and commanders with unparalleled experience have emerged from this war. In his message, Halevi claimed Israel has defeated the military wing of Hamas, but continues to fight its "terrorist capabilities". "We have dealt a severe blow to Hezbollah, which has lost all of its senior leadership," he added.</p>

<p>Israel is fighting a multi-front war against the Hamas in Gaza and Lebanon on its northern border. It is also fighting Iran, which last week launched a barrage of missiles after the killing of Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah, besides conducting airstrikes in Yemen.</p>

<p>"We are not stopping - we fight, debrief, learn, and improve...We are destroying our enemies' capabilities, and we will ensure that these capabilities are not rebuilt, so that October 7th is never repeated," said the army chief.</p>

<p>The message from the commander-in-chief seeks to boost the morale of the troops with the focus of the war shifting from Gaza to Lebanon and its ally Iran.</p>

<p>With Iran entering the war, Israel now faces an even tougher challenge, especially after a warning from its supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei that Israel will "not last long".</p>

<p>The Middle East crisis has sparked a rise in oil price across the world. The US and other countries have urged Israel and Iran to avoid an all-out war amid fears of a retaliation to the missile attacks.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 53-year-old New York man spent 22 years in prison for a double homicide he did not commit. Now, he is turning his life around. Calvin Buari, after his acquittal in 2017, launched Ryderz Van Service, a rideshare company focused on connecting families with their loved ones in prison. exonerated<br />
<br />
In the early 1990s, Calvin Buari, a flashy drug dealer in the Bronx, walked the streets in designer clothes and drove a black BMW he nicknamed the “Black Man's Wish.” His rise to the top of the drug trade in New York City came at a heavy price. He was wrongly convicted in a case where no physical evidence tied him to the crime. It wasn't until years later that the truth began to surface.<br />
<br />
Calvin Buari's journey to freedom was long and hard-fought. Convicted in 1995 of a double homicide, Buari was sentenced to 50 years to life for the deaths of two brothers, Elijah and Salhaddin Harris, in the Bronx. The conviction was based on false testimony from rival drug dealers. Years later, a fellow prisoner confessed to the crime, but Buari remained locked up until 2017 when new witnesses came forward to testify in his defence.<br />
<br />
Reflecting on his time behind bars, Calvin Buari said prison transformed him. “Going to prison saved my life,” he told <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/10/06/us/calvin-buari-wrongful-conviction-cec/index.html ">CNN</a>. "Before I went to prison, I was like the caterpillar,” he said. “Then when I was in prison, I had to transform my life and try to do more productive things. I had to see the potential in myself.” He called that his “cocoon phase.” “And now that I'm out, I feel like I'm in the butterfly phase,” said the 53-year-old.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Buari's story gained national attention through the podcast <em>Empire on Blood</em>, which detailed the injustices that led to his wrongful conviction and his fight for freedom. Host Steve Fishman, a former journalist, began recording Buari's phone calls from prison in 2011, and he was there when Buari was finally released in May 2017.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Calvin Buari earned his General Education Development and paralegal certificate in prison.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
After his release, Calvin Buari received $7.75 million in settlements from New York City and State. He invested in real estate and owns a million-dollar home in Texas. He also launched a rideshare company, Ryderz Van Service, offering door-to-door prison visitation services.<br />
<br />
While Buari's freedom came at a significant cost, he believes his experience has given him a second chance. “I was lost … but now, I find grace in my actions,” he said. “I pray that those I hurt can find it in their hearts to forgive me.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thousands marched in US cities from Washington to Los Angeles on Saturday, demanding an immediate ceasefire as the war in Gaza nears the one-year mark, with a man attempting to self-immolate in protest.</p>

<p>The marches were part of a worldwide day of action against the devastating war, which has recently seen Israel intensify its military operations in Lebanon.</p>

<p>The war was sparked on October 7 when the Palestinian armed group Hamas attacked Israel, resulting in the deaths of 1,205 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures that include hostages killed in captivity.</p>

<p>More than 41,825 Palestinians, a majority of them civilians, have been killed in Israel's military campaign in the Gaza Strip since the war began, according to data provided by the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza. The UN has acknowledged the figures as reliable.</p>

<p>In Washington, more than a thousand angry protesters demonstrated outside the White House, with many demanding an end to the US military and other aid to its strategic ally, Israel.</p>

<p>"The US government has really shown what side of history it is on," Zaid Khatib, an organizer with the Palestinian Youth Movement, told AFP.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The US government has performed and co-signed the most evil atrocities that we've seen of this century."</p>

<p>Protesters waved Palestinian and Lebanese flags, among others, with many holding up signs and chanting in unison to demonstrate solidarity with the Palestinian cause.</p>

<p>Almost two hours into the protest, a man approached the demonstration site and attempted to set himself on fire, AFP journalists saw.</p>

<p>He succeeded in lighting his left arm ablaze before bystanders and police rushed to his aid, dousing him with water and extinguishing the flames using their keffiyehs, traditional Palestinian scarves.</p>

<p>"I'm a journalist and we neglect it, we spread the misinformation," he shouted, in between screams of pain as the fire on his arm was put out.</p>

<p>Police said the man was being treated for "non-life threatening injuries."</p>

<h3><strong>'Ethnic cleansing'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>In New York, thousands marched in the city's famed Times Square neighbourhood, some carrying pictures of people killed by Israel's military offensive in Gaza, which has left much of the territory in rubble.</p>

<p>Among those marching was Cornel West, a prominent rights activist and an independent candidate running in the US presidential election.</p>

<p>"I'm here to forever be in solidarity with people undergoing a vicious genocide," he told AFP. "Dealing with ethnic cleansing it's getting worse, it's been a whole year now. You know, we got to keep fighting."</p>

<p>The United States is one of Israel's closest allies, providing billions in military assistance -- a subject that protesters in both cities focused on.</p>

<p>"As an American, we're tired of our tax money going to Israel to bomb kids in Palestine and then Lebanon," said Daniel Perez, a New York resident.</p>

<p>Protesters also took to the streets in Los Angeles, many holding signs calling for an end to "genocide" in Gaza.</p>

<p>In Washington, protesters' cries for "justice" and "peace" reverberated off office buildings downtown, with the crowd animated by a mix of righteous anger and raucous solidarity.</p>

<p>Laila, an American of Palestinian and Lebanese descent, told AFP the past year had left her disillusioned with her country's leaders -- so much so that she was unlikely to vote in November.</p>

<p>"It all disgusts me now," she said. "It's all a lie."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On the morning of October 7, 2023, Ismail Abu Hatab, a photojournalist, woke up to the deafening roar of rockets being fired from Gaza towards Israel. "It felt like the world was ending," he recalled. Ismail instinctively grabbed his phone, seeking clarity in the chaos. The headlines were unthinkable reports of a large-scale attack initiated by the Palestinian group Hamas on Israel. "Has the resistance really pulled this off?" he wondered in shock.</p>

<p>For <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-me-rebuilt-my-life-during-and-after-war-ismail-abu-ha">32-year-old Ismail</a>, the initial hours were a blur of activity. "I immediately started preparing - charging my camera equipment, emptying memory disks on my laptop, and reaching out to my fellow journalists and photographers to verify the situation," Ismail told NDTV. With adrenaline coursing through his veins, he grabbed his camera and ventured out, initially staying close to his neighbourhood in Gaza City, uncertain of what would come next. He joined his colleagues at the Al-Shifa medical complex, Gaza's largest hospital. Together, they climbed to the top of a tall building to capture the unfolding chaos.</p>

<p>After October 7, Gaza descended into mayhem. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered an invasion of Gaza. The besieged Palestinian enclave witnessed relentless strikes, with entire neighbourhoods flattened and reduced to rubble.</p>

</div>

<p>"The following days were relentless. We lost some of our fellow journalists, and working conditions became incredibly difficult. We were forced to sleep on the streets after threats were made to media<br />
offices, and we began operating out of the Al-Shifa medical complex for a while due to the internet blackout in Gaza. Despite the brutal attacks by the Israeli military, we continued risking our lives to document the invasion," Ismail told NDTV.</p>

<h2><strong>Covering War In Gaza&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p>For Ismail, work continued from the Al-Ghafari tower, Gaza's tallest building, where international and local journalists had set up a small office to document the strikes. But conditions were brutal. "There was no electricity, so we relied on electronic SIM cards to access the internet," Ismail recalled. Running up and down the tower's sixteen floors to capture footage had become routine. "If it was too dangerous to go home, we would sleep in our cars or even on the streets." Every day, the toll grew - physically and mentally - but the mission remained the same: to document Gaza's reality under siege.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-10/decong8g_gaza-photojournalist-_625x300_06_October_24.jpeg?im=FaceCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=1200,height=738" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>

<p class="ins_instory_dv_caption"><span class="ins_instory_span_credit">Photo Credit: Ismail Abu Hatab </span></p>
</div>

<p>Safety measures for journalists in Gaza are virtually nonexistent, Ismail explained, leaving many local reporters in an extremely precarious position. "While international news agencies provide some journalists with protective gear, vehicles, and offices, the resources available to local journalists are quite limited." For freelancers like Ismail, the challenges are even greater. There is no institutional support, no protective vests, no insurance. "Freelancers are left to fend for themselves," he says. Despite the lack of safety equipment, he continued his work, relying on his colleagues' help for transportation and protection when possible.</p>

<p>"During the conflict, many international agencies asked their journalists to leave Gaza City and move south for their safety. My work was often a collaborative effort with other journalists who had<br />
access to safety equipment and transportation, but this was only temporary. Personally, I found it difficult to secure a press vest and safe transport, relying on help from my colleagues for protection when possible," Ismail told NDTV.</p>

<h2><strong>A Faint Yellow Light</strong></h2>

<p>The risks culminated in tragedy on November 2, 2023, when Ismail was injured during an Israeli airstrike while working at the Al-Ghafari tower. "That night was intense-Israeli airstrikes were relentless, wiping out entire residential blocks," he recalled. The morning after, as he sat down to edit footage from the previous day, disaster struck.</p>

<p>"By morning, after making a cup of coffee, I sat down to review and edit footage from the previous day. As I worked, everything suddenly went dark. I couldn't hear or see anything for a moment. Then I realised I was buried under rubble - an entire wall had collapsed on me," Ismail said.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-10/qkbk1qog_gaza-photojournalist-_625x300_06_October_24.jpeg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>

<p class="ins_instory_dv_caption"><span class="ins_instory_span_credit">Photo Credit: Ismail Abu Hatab </span></p>
</div>

<p>Ismail's colleagues rushed to pull him out, and the pain hit him like a wave. "I remember seeing a faint yellow light through the dust, but I was completely disoriented. My left leg was severely injured. I could not stand. They carried me down 16 flights of stairs, and every step was agonising." With Israeli missiles exploding indiscriminately around the neighbourhood, the idea of an ambulance coming to rescue Ismail was unthinkable.</p>

<p>With his body covered in blood and his leg badly damaged, he was rushed to Al-Shifa Hospital by his colleagues. By the time they arrived, he had lost consciousness.</p>

<p>He woke to a scene of utter chaos. "The sounds of injured people, death, and cries of farewell surrounded me."</p>

<p>Due to the overwhelming number of casualties, Ismail could not get a bed, let alone the surgery he needed. A colleague took him to a tent for journalists, where he waited for days. Eventually, he was transferred to the Palestine Red Crescent Hospital in Tel Al-Hawa in southern Gaza City, but as fate would have it, the hospital itself came under siege. Ismail and others trapped inside feared for their lives, with Israeli forces advancing outside.</p>

<h2><strong>Road To Recovery</strong></h2>

<p>After days of terror, a breakthrough came - a phone call from the Israeli army, granting them half an hour to evacuate the injured. "We were loaded onto a truck under heavy fire," Ismail recalled. But even the evacuation was fraught with danger. At a checkpoint, Israeli forces forced the injured, including Ismail, to exit the truck, leaving them exposed to sniper fire. Eventually, they were moved to southern Gaza, and Ismail was taken to Al-Amal Hospital in Khan Younis for further medical care. It marked the beginning of a long and painful recovery process that would span months.</p>

<p class="ins_instory_dv_caption"><span class="ins_instory_span_credit">Photo Credit: Ismail Abu Hatab </span></p>
</div>

<p>"I was taken to Al-Amal Hospital for further medical evaluation and then moved to stay with my sister in Khan Younis. Unfortunately, during this time, the Israeli army advanced further, and my brother-in-law was killed. We had to flee again, moving from Khan Younis to Rafah, then to Deir Al-Balah," Ismail told NDTV.</p>

<p>The scars of that day, both physical and psychological, are still raw for Ismail. "For ten months, I could not walk," he said. "My recovery has been slow."</p>

<p>Despite undergoing a second surgery, the procedure was botched, and he's still awaiting treatment abroad to correct it. "Despite everything, my recovery has been entirely personal," Ismail lamented, adding that no organisation - whether local or international - has offered financial support for his treatment. "I've had to cover all the expenses myself. Currently, I am unemployed, but I'm trying to rebuild my life."</p>

<h2><strong>'So Much Death'</strong></h2>

<p>The scenes that Ismail witnessed as a photojournalist continue to haunt him. "One of the most disturbing things I have witnessed is the use of fire belts - indiscriminate, sudden, and deadly," he said. "Buildings and entire neighbourhoods collapse. Lives are lost as if they were just numbers." It is the human toll that weighs heaviest on him. "Children, women, the elderly - all innocent lives taken away. When I go into the field to document these events, I often see people trapped under the rubble. It haunts me."</p>

<p>"I ask myself, what was their fault? Why are they dying when they loved life? What were their dreams? What were they doing just before they were killed? How did they live? What about their children and their spouses? I have seen many martyrs, their meals still in front of them, unable to finish eating because they were killed. I think about that moment they must have felt just before death. Why is an innocent person with simple dreams, a beautiful family, and a modest living taken away so cruelly?</p>

</div>

<p>"I have seen so much death. The mass graves and the final farewells - these things affect me deeply. How can one group of people decide the fate of another and kill them in this way? "</p>

<p>One particularly harrowing experience stands out in his memory. After the bombing of the Al-Ahli Baptist Hospital, Ismail met a mother and her young son. The boy suffered serious injuries to his internal organs due to an airstrike, affecting his mental health severely. "He was such a kind and cheerful boy," Ismail said. Trapped together for days at the Palestine Red Crescent Hospital during the siege, Ismail recalled a particularly poignant moment. "A man ran after our truck, shouting the boy's name. He climbed onto the truck and embraced him, saying, 'Forgive me, I didn't see you because I was busy saving others'. The man was the boy's father."</p>

<p>In this reunion, Ismail found a rare moment of humanity amidst the wanton carnage.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-10/a1io5it_gaza-photojournalist-_625x300_06_October_24.jpg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>

<p class="ins_instory_dv_caption"><span class="ins_instory_span_credit">Photo Credit: Ismail Abu Hatab </span></p>
</div>

<p>Another haunting memory is of a man Ismail helped rescue from beneath the rubble of a collapsed building near his home. "I heard a faint sound coming from beneath the rubble," he recalled. Along with local young men, he pulled the man out alive. By chance, he met the survivor again while recovering at the Red Crescent Hospital. "You are a miracle. How did you survive?" Ismail asked him. The man's calm response: "By the will of God, because I take care of orphans."</p>

<h2><strong>Mental Toll Of Covering War</strong></h2>

<p>Journalists covering war and conflict often suffer post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Being a photojournalist who has witnessed everything from children with their limbs severed to the destruction of infrastructure on an unprecedented scale, Ismail's mental health remains affected.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-10/qgrq9f2o_gaza-photojournalist-_625x300_06_October_24.jpeg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>

<p class="ins_instory_dv_caption"><span class="ins_instory_span_credit">Photo Credit: Ismail Abu Hatab </span></p>
</div>

<p>"I suffer from significant effects due to the experiences I've been through. I face difficulties with sleep, memory issues, and depression. The sounds of explosions and the cries of the families of martyrs echo in my mind." Despite the emotional and physical pain, Ismail continues to document Gaza's suffering, driven by a sense of duty towards his country. "I believe that I was created for a reason in this life," he said, "and I possess skills in filmmaking and storytelling that empower me to share the truth."</p>

<p>Many journalists in Gaza have paid the ultimate price for telling that truth. "I have lost colleagues and friends in this war," Ismail said. "But I have chosen to remain here, refusing to leave Gaza, because this country needs me. How can I abandon it in its time of need?"</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Advocacy groups behind the controversial ‘<a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/swiss-police-make-arrests-after-suicide-capsule-is-used-for-first-time-6651845 ">Sarco</a>' suicide pod have suspended applications for its use, pending a criminal investigation into its first deployment in Switzerland. The decision comes after a 64-year-old American woman died using the device. At least 371 applications submitted till September 23 will remain on hold until the conclusion of the probe.</p>

<p>Florian Willet, president of The Last Resort, a Switzerland-based advocacy group, is currently in pretrial detention, according to the organisation and Exit International, an Australian-founded affiliate. Swiss police arrested Willet and several others following the woman's death on September 23 in a forest in Schaffhausen, near the German border. Authorities have since released the other detainees, though the investigation continues.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/sarco-suicide-pod-how-the-controversial-capsule-functions-and-the-chilling-message-it-delivers-6653103"><strong>Read: Sarco Suicide Pod: How The Controversial Capsule Functions</strong></a></p>

<p>The Sarco, developed by Exit International, allows individuals to end their lives through inert gas asphyxiation.&nbsp;Short for “sarcophagus”, the Sarco pod is a 3D-printed, self-operated capsule designed to facilitate assisted suicide through nitrogen-induced hypoxia. The individual sits in the capsule, which fills with nitrogen gas, reducing the oxygen level to fatal amounts, resulting in death by suffocation within minutes.</p>

<p>Advocates, including Exit International's founder Philip Nitschke, argue that the Sarco offers a “peaceful, fast, and dignified” end of life. However, these claims have yet to be independently verified.</p>

<p>On the day of the US woman's death, Swiss Health Minister Elisabeth Baume-Schneider addressed lawmakers, declaring the use of the Sarco “not legal.” The incident sparked debate in Switzerland, where assisted suicide is permissible subject to a set of rules.</p>

<p>The device, which cost over $1 million to develop, was first introduced in Switzerland in 2019. The application process requires individuals to pass a psychiatric assessment and answer a series of questions within the capsule to ensure they are aware of the consequences of their decision.</p>

<p>“Only after the Sarco was used was it learned that Ms Baume-Schneider had addressed the issue,” the groups said in a statement, as per <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/10/06/europe/suicide-capsule-switzerland-intl-hnk/index.html ">CNN</a>. “The timing was a pure coincidence and not our intention.”</p>

<p>Switzerland's long-standing laws on assisted suicide have positioned the country as a “death tourism” destination, with individuals travelling from around the world seeking control over their end-of-life choices. The Sarco's creator, Philip Nitschke, has been a prominent figure in the euthanasia debate since the 1990s. He maintains that the capsule offers a humane and autonomous way to die, free from medical intervention.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Reuters photograph of Inas Abu Maamar, face buried in the shrouded body of her dead five-year-old niece Saly, was taken days after Israel began its military offensive on Gaza.</p>

<p>It has become one of the most vivid images of Palestinian suffering during the year-long bombing of Gaza, Israel's response to Hamas' Oct. 7 attack.</p>

<p>Saly was killed with her mother, baby sister, grandparents, uncle, aunt and three cousins. Since then, Abu Maamar, 37, has also lost her sister, killed along with her four children in an airstrike in northern Gaza.</p>

<p>Abu Maamar has moved three times to avoid bombing, at one point spending four months living in a tent. Today, she is back in her home in Khan Younis, in southern Gaza. Cracks run through the corrugated roof; a shower curtain covers a window-sized hole in the wall.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-10/l826vd9g_abu-maamar-_625x300_07_October_24.jpg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>"We lost all hope in everything," said Abu Maamar, sitting amid rubble in the small graveyard by the family house. Beneath the debris, she said, lay Saly's grave.</p>

<p>"Even the grave was not safe."</p>

<p>Hamas' attack on Oct. 7 killed around 1,200 people in Israel, mostly civilians, and about 250 people were taken hostage, according to Israeli tallies.</p>

<p>Israel's campaign in Gaza, with the declared goal of wiping out Hamas, has since killed at least 41,500 people, mostly civilians, according to Palestinian health authorities.</p>

<p>Israel's military has said its bombardment of Gaza is necessary to crush Hamas, which it accuses of hiding among the general Palestinian population. Hamas denies this. Israel says it tries to reduce harm to civilians.</p>

<p>AIRSTRIKE</p>

<p>Before Oct. 7, Gaza had faced an extensive Israeli blockade following Hamas' takeover of the Palestinian territory in 2007. There was little work and imports were severely restricted but her family was settled, Abu Maamar said.</p>

<p>Abu Maamar lived with her husband near her brother Ramez' family, allowing her to spend much of her time with her nieces Saly and Seba and her nephew Ahmed.</p>

<p>As bombing intensified near the house after Oct. 7, Ramez sheltered with his family at his in-laws' about 1 km (0.6 miles) away. It was hit in an airstrike the next day.</p>

<p>When Abu Maamar heard she went straight to the Nasser hospital in Khan Younis. There she saw Ahmed, then 4, and grabbed him by the hand. She found Saly, dead, in the mortuary.</p>

<p>"I tried to wake her up. I couldn't believe she was dead," she said.</p>

<p>It was there that Reuters photographer Mohammed Salem took the picture of Abu Maamar cradling her dead niece, her body wrapped in a white sheet. The image was named World Press Photo of the year and won a Pulitzer Prize along with other Reuters images of the Oct. 7 attack and war in Gaza.</p>

<p>DISPLACEMENT</p>

<p>Israel said it had attacked 5,000 Hamas targets in Gaza from Oct. 7 until Oct. 17, the day of the airstrike that killed Saly. Palestinian health authorities said about 3,000 people had been killed by that point, including 940 children.</p>

<p>Israel's military did not respond to a request for comment on the strike that killed Saly.</p>

<p>In a comment six days after her death about the killing of another family in a different airstrike in Khan Younis, a spokesperson for Israel's military said: "Hamas has entrenched itself among the civilian population throughout the Gaza Strip. So wherever a Hamas target arises, the IDF will strike at it in order to thwart the terrorist capabilities of the group, while taking feasible precautions to mitigate the harm to uninvolved civilians."</p>

<p>By December, with Palestinian authorities saying the death toll in Gaza had topped 15,000 and Israel preparing to expand its ground assault to southern Gaza, Abu Maamar and other family members moved to Mawasi, a beach area where displaced people sought refuge in tents. They moved twice more as Israeli forces battled Hamas across the south, ordering civilians first from Khan Younis and then the city of Rafah.</p>

<p>Now back home, Abu Maamar says there is no point moving anymore. She picked up Saly's favourite outfit, a black dress with traditional red Palestinian embroidery, and pressed it to her face.</p>

<p>"We are just waiting for the cascade of blood to stop."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With candles, prayers and music, commemorations for the October 7 attack began in Israel's Tel Aviv on Sunday at a ceremony to mark the first anniversary of the Hamas onslaught at the Nova music festival.</p>

<p>Picture of those killed appeared on a screen at the entrance to the ceremony, as hundreds gathered to light candles at a makeshift shrine, leave handwritten notes or simply embrace each other.</p>

<p>"Coming to this event one year after this terrible massacre that happened on October 7, it's very touching, it's very breathtaking," said one of the event's organisers Solly Laniado.</p>

<p>"Three days ago, we were not even going to hold the event at all," he said, citing the deluge of rocket warnings and last week's missile attack on Tel Aviv that have left many people on edge and large parts of the usually vibrant city empty.</p>

<p>The anniversary comes with Israel engaged in a fresh war in Lebanon against Hezbollah and preparing to retaliate against Tehran, raising fears of an even wider conflict.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Anticipation is building over how and when Israel will respond to Iran's missile barrage last week, with the uncertainty casting a shadow over the commemoration.</p>

<p>"It's a difficult day," said Omri Sasi, 35, one of the producers of last year's festival who survived the attack.</p>

<p>By his own estimate, he lost roughly 50 friends that day, including an uncle, a pregnant cousin and her husband.</p>

<h3><strong>Onslaught of violence&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>The two-day festival in the fields around Kibbutz Reim was just beyond the Gaza border in southern Israel and attracted over 3,000 attendees from October 6 and 7.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At least 370 people were killed at the Nova rave in the Negev desert, making it the deadliest location during the October 7 attack.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Footage from the day filmed by Hamas showed the militants gunning down festival-goers en masse as they attempted to flee and taking others hostages, with the heavily armed Hamas fighters moving through the area unopposed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Following the attack, the festival location was left largely untouched with dozens of burnt-out vehicles and abandoned tents, sleeping bags and clothes strewn across the field.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The festival attack was part of an onslaught of violence unleashed by Palestinian Hamas militants that resulted in the deaths of 1,205 people on the Israeli side, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on the latest official Israeli figures. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Some 251 people were captured and taken as hostages to the Gaza Strip, of whom 97 are still held captive in the coastal territory, including 37 the Israeli military says are dead.</p>

<p>During a one-week truce in late November, 105 hostages were released in exchange for 240 Palestinian prisoners.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hours after the October 7 attack, Israel launched a blistering military offensive on Gaza that has reduced large swaths of the territory to rubble and displaced nearly all of its 2.4 million residents at least once amid an unrelenting humanitarian crisis.</p>

<p>In Gaza, at least 41,870 people have been killed since the start of the Israel offensive, a majority of them civilians, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run Palestinian territory.</p>

<p>The figures have been deemed to be reliable by the United Nations.</p>

<p>But as the anniversary arrives, for many it's just the latest marker in a year tarnished by trauma, loss and ongoing war.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"It's not easy to think a lot about it," said Sasi.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It has been a year since the war between Israel and Hamas erupted, a conflict that has brought unspeakable devastation to the Gaza Strip. The days since October 7 have stretched into months of relentless bombings, displacement, and desperation. For the people living in Gaza, the conflict has stripped them of their homes, their loved ones, and their sense of normalcy. It is not just buildings that have crumbled, but entire lives - careers, dreams, families - torn apart by the ravages of war.</p>

<p>The numbers tell only part of the story. Behind each statistic is a personal tragedy. Homes are now rubble, hospitals are overwhelmed, and the world seems to look on helplessly, watching as the conflict deepens. The war has displaced hundreds of thousands, turning vibrant communities into mere shadows of their former selves. For the survivors, daily life is a continuous struggle, and yet within that struggle, there are those who push forward.</p>

<p>One such individual is Dr Khaled Alshawwa, a 31-year-old surgeon from Gaza City. Khaled, like many in his community, never planned to be on the frontlines of a humanitarian crisis. Just a week before the war, he had completed his surgical training at Almakassed Hospital in Jerusalem, a prestigious medical institution. He had returned to Gaza for what was meant to be a brief family visit-just a few days to reconnect with loved ones before continuing his career.</p>

</div>

<p>But then the war began, and everything changed. In an instant, Khaled found himself in the midst of one of the most brutal conflicts Gaza has seen, unable to leave, compelled to stay and help.</p>

<p>"The immediate aftermath was chaos," Khaled recalls. "We faced an overwhelming influx of severely injured patients with limited medical supplies and infrastructure. This was much aggregated and intensified after the destruction of many hospitals. As a doctor, I have to prioritise cases, often making difficult decisions with minimal resources."</p>

<p>Khaled, a surgeon trained for the most complex procedures, was forced to make rapid, agonising decisions with almost no support.</p>

<p>"Life has drastically changed. I am constantly navigating between being a surgeon, managing medical points, struggling to provide basic daily needs to me and my family like fresh water, food and a place to stay in amidst severe shortages of resources and ongoing bombings," Khaled said.</p>

<p>The injuries that filled the hospitals were devastating: shrapnel wounds, blast injuries, complex fractures, severe burns, and traumatic amputations. "Many of the injuries involve multiple body parts," he explains, requiring teams of surgeons working in tandem. But with a healthcare system on the brink of collapse, they don't have the luxury of specialisation. "We are stretched beyond belief. A surgeon might have to handle trauma, pediatric surgery, even urology, and vascular procedures, all at once. It is exhausting, physically and mentally."</p>

<p>The situation was made worse by the fact that medical supplies are running low. Basic necessities - anaesthetics, sutures, bandages, antibiotics - are in short supply. "We have to improvise," he says. "In some cases, we had no choice but to turn to telemedicine, relying on colleagues abroad for guidance."</p>

<p>The chaos of the war meant that Khaled's life is in constant motion. "I have moved seven times since the war began," he says, each relocation a desperate attempt to keep his family safe. His base of operations has also shifted as the conflict ebbs and flows. "I have volunteered at almost every hospital in Gaza City," he explains, as the nature of the war has required him to be flexible. "Wherever I go, I try to offer what little help I can."</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-10/5kkd5dto_gaza-doctor-_625x300_06_October_24.jpeg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>For Khaled, each new base brings with it a fresh set of challenges. He describes the scenes with stark clarity - overcrowded refugee camps, where families huddle together in makeshift shelters, trying to stay alive amidst airstrikes from Israel. "Infection control is nearly impossible in these conditions," he says, pointing to the lack of sanitation and clean water. Overcrowding in the camps has led to the rapid spread of disease. "We are seeing infections in open wounds, as well as dermatological diseases in previously healthy people."</p>

<p>These camps, Khaled notes, are where the most vulnerable-women and children-are suffering the most. "Maternity and pediatric care are severely impacted," he says. "Many women are giving birth in unsafe environments, and children are missing out on basic healthcare." Immunisation programs, vital to protecting children from preventable diseases, have also been disrupted. Khaled himself was involved in a recent polio vaccination campaign organised by the Palestine Red Crescent Society. Despite the overwhelming challenges, including maintaining cold chains for vaccines in areas with no electricity, the team managed to vaccinate over 120,000 children under the age of ten in North Gaza.</p>

<p>But it is not enough.</p>

<p>The strain on Gaza's healthcare system is unprecedented, and the long-term impact of the war on public health is staggering. "The magnitude of disability we are witnessing is terrifying," Khaled says. The rise in amputations, spinal injuries, and traumatic brain damage will have consequences that last for decades. "These are injuries that will require years, if not a lifetime, of care," he warns. "The healthcare system simply isn't equipped to deal with this."</p>

<p>Like many in Gaza, Khaled's personal losses are intertwined with the collective grief of his people. "I lost my mother in a bombing," he revealed. In addition to his mother, he has lost his home and many close friends. But despite this immense personal loss, Khaled has remained resolute. "It's tough," he admits. "Psychologically, it's very hard. The constant pressure, the loss, the fear for your family - it takes a toll."</p>

<p>And yet, like so many others in Gaza, Khaled continues to move forward. "Staying focused on helping others is what keeps me going," he says, though there are moments when the weight of it all feels unbearable. "Every day is a struggle," he admits. "But I can't give up, not when there are so many people depending on us."</p>

<p>The war in Gaza is not happening in isolation. The Israeli-Hamas conflict has drawn in international players, with each new development bringing the risk of a broader regional conflict. In Lebanon, Israeli airstrikes have intensified, killing hundreds. Hezbollah, a militant group backed by Iran, has escalated its exchanges with Israel, meaning that the war has extended far beyond Gaza's borders.</p>

<p>In Europe, the conflict has sparked a political backlash. Countries like Spain and Ireland have recognised the State of Palestine in defiance of Israeli opposition. The United States on the other hand continues to provide Israel with military and financial support, most recently approving an $8.7 billion aid package. For Palestinians like Khaled, international aid is critical to the survival of Gaza's healthcare system, yet the future of that support remains uncertain.</p>

<p>The United Nations estimates that nearly 80,000 homes have been destroyed, and it could take decades to rebuild the city. Khaled agrees. "It will take years, maybe even decades, to get Gaza's health infrastructure back on track," Khaled says. "Without substantial international aid, the recovery will be slow, and people will continue to suffer."</p>

<p>But the road to recovery is long, and the scars of this war will linger for generations.</p>]]></content:encoded>

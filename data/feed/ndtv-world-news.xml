       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jimmy Carter celebrated his 100th birthday today - the first ever US president to reach the century mark and another extraordinary milestone for the one-time peanut farmer who found his way to the White House.</p>

<p>Carter's longevity - he began hospice care at his home in Plains, Georgia, more than 19 months ago - has defied all expectations.</p>

<p>No longer regularly appearing in public, the Democratic ex-president is spending his birthday in the home he and his late wife Rosalynn had built in Plains in the 1960s. Celebrations include a lunch with some 20 members of his extended family, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.</p>

<p>President Joe Biden, in a video posted on his official X account, hailed Carter as a "beloved friend" and "one of the most influential statesmen" in US history.</p>

<p>"Your unwavering belief in the power of human goodness continues to be a guiding light for all of us," he said.</p>

<p>The White House lawn was decorated Tuesday with a sign that read "Happy Birthday President Carter."</p>

<p>Britain's King Charles III sent a private message of congratulations expressing "great admiration for the president's lifetime of duty and public service," a Buckingham Palace spokesperson said.</p>

<p>And Georgia Governor Brian Kemp, currently overseeing the response to a major storm disaster, proclaimed "Jimmy Carter Day" across the state.</p>

<h3><strong>LITTLE TOWN</strong></h3>

<p>Beyond serving as commander in chief for a single term from 1977 to 1981, Carter worked as a global mediator, rights activist and elder statesman, founding the well-respected Carter Center in 1982 to pursue his vision of world diplomacy.</p>

<p>His presidency included the 1978 Camp David Accords between Israel and Egypt, the establishment of diplomatic relations with China following a rapprochement initiated by president Richard Nixon, and the return of control of the Panama Canal to Panama.</p>

<p>But his administration hit numerous snags, including the Iran hostage crisis and a renewed oil crisis in 1979-1980, which saw Ronald Reagan sweep into power in a landslide.</p>

<p>"We are thrilled that the president from this little town is going to be the only president to ever live to be 100 years old," Jill Stuckey, superintendent of the National Park Service's Jimmy Carter historical site and longtime family friend, told AFP.</p>

<p>She spoke from Plains High School, where Carter graduated in 1941 and which now serves as the visitor center for the national park that features sites from his early life, including the nearby peanut farm where he grew up.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, the school held a naturalization ceremony for 100 new US citizens, who placed hands over their hearts and recited the pledge of allegiance.</p>

<p>"He did so much for America," said Adriana Vickers, 46, originally from Brazil.</p>

<p>"He's for all nations," Carlene Ford, another newly naturalized citizen, from Jamaica, told AFP. "He's for everybody, he's for the people."</p>

<p>A flyover of four F-18 jets and two vintage planes graced the skies over Plains as part of the town's celebrations.</p>

<h3><strong>'ALWAYS' POLITICAL</strong></h3>

<p>A devout Baptist and self-described "born-again" Christian, Carter is remembered for a moralistic streak, but also his civility, admired even by detractors across the aisle.</p>

<p>According to family, Carter remains keenly interested in politics and was highly motivated to make it to 100 and to vote in the November election for fellow Democrat Kamala Harris.</p>

<p>"He will be voting by mail-in ballot," Stuckey told AFP, adding "he's always been very politically active, and nothing has changed with that respect."</p>

<p>At the naturalization ceremony, attended by the mayor, those in attendance were encouraged to register to vote.</p>

<p>In Plains, like in many rural places with strong evangelical Christian leanings, far more yard signs support Republican Donald Trump than Harris.</p>

<p>But it is also not uncommon to see a sign celebrating Carter's centennial birthday next to one supporting Trump.</p>

<p>Carl Lowell, who has lived in Plains since infancy, said he tries not to get involved in politics because it is "so divisive" right now.</p>

<p>Like most residents of Plains, the 59-year-old retired firefighter is linked to Carter in various ways -- he says his grandfather helped build the Carters' house and that he himself even went dove hunting with him once.</p>

<p>"Jimmy's a good man, he's a godly man, and that's what people like about him," he said.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President Joe Biden has ordered the US military to "aid Israel's defense" and shoot down any and all Iranian missiles targeting Israel, the White House said.</p>

<p>President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee in next month's US presidential election, are both monitoring Iran's attack on Israel from the White House situation room, it said.</p>

<p>"President Biden directed the US military to aid Israel's defense against Iranian attacks and shoot down missiles that are targeting Israel," the White House said in a statement.</p>

<p>A call that Joe Biden had scheduled with rabbis today ahead of the Jewish high holiday season - which begins later this week with Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish new year - had been postponed to another day, a White House official said.</p>

<p>The United States and other western allies also stepped in to help defend Israel against a combined Iranian missile and drone attack in April, which Tehran launched in retaliation for an Israeli strike on the Iranian consulate in Damascus.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iran has attacked Israel with missiles and rockets today after tensions escalated in West Asia following artillery and air strikes on Lebanon to target Hezbollah, a Shia militant outfit and a strong ally of Iran.</p>

<p>Iran's Revolutionary Guards said today's attack is in response to the killing of Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah last week as well as that of the Hamas leader.</p>

<p>Israel's formidable air defence systems were in action to intercept rockets and missiles launched from Iran. Videos show the night sky lighting up with explosions after air raid sirens echoed across the country. The missiles were detected over the Jordanian air space, the flight path followed by the missiles when fired toward Israel. Jordan has announced a suspension of air traffic after the attack on Israel.</p>

<p>The <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/rockets-fired-from-iran-on-israel-civilians-hiding-in-bomb-shelters-says-israel-defence-forces-6694961">missiles were raining down</a> on Israel and the Iron Dome and Arrow air defence system were in action to intercept and neutralise the targets. Iran fired over 100 missiles, Israeli media reported and several videos showed intercepted missile debris falling over Israeli cities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, President Joe Biden has ordered the US military to "aid Israel's defence" and shoot down Iranian missiles targeting Israel. Both Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris are monitoring Iran's attack on Israel from the White House situation room, it said in a statement.</p>

<p>This is the second Iranian attack on Israel in less than six months. In April, Iran launched a swarm of explosive drones and fired missiles at Israel. The Iranian salvo amounted to more than 200 drones and missiles. Iran has vowed retaliation for what it called an Israeli strike on its Damascus consulate on April 1 that killed seven Guards officers including two senior commanders.</p>

<h3><strong>Israel's Multi-Tier Air Defence System</strong></h3>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/israel-iran-war-explained-how-israel-countered-irans-aerial-attack-with-arrow-missiles-5437654">The Arrow Defence System</a> is a surface-to-surface missile system forming an upper tier in Israel's multi-layered air defence system.</p>

<p>Iron Dome has shot down thousands of rockets since 2011 but is limited to a short range. Israel also has a medium-to-long-range interceptor known as David's Sling.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/israel-palestine-hamas-gaza-iron-dome-how-israel-defends-its-skies-from-rocket-attacks-4460636">Iron Dome</a>, David's Sling, and the Arrow Defence System create a layered defence system. The Iron Dome system, which has been battle-tested in the past, was actively deployed to intercept drones and short-range threats.</p>

<p>The radar of Arrow 2 - used against long-range ballistic missiles - has an effective range of 2,400 kilometres and can strike altitudes of 100 kilometres.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The radar constantly detects incoming threats towards the territory. Once a target is detected, real-time information is relayed to the control centre regarding the estimated trajectory of the target, its speed, and if the missile is heading toward a strategic target like cities or military establishments, the missile is launched.</p>

<p>The Arrow 3 Air Defence System neutralize targets in the exo-atmosphere before the ballistic missile enters the re-entry stage. In April, when Iran launched an unprecedented attack on Israel with ballistic and cruise missiles, the Arrow 3 system intercepted the missiles before the re-entry stage in the atmosphere.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The United States has funded roughly half of the annual development costs of the Arrow 2 system. By 2020, the total U.S. financial contribution toward the Arrow Weapon System exceeded $3.7 billion.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iran's Revolutionary Guards threatened to carry out "crushing attacks" against regional foe Israel if it retaliated for a missile attack under way on Tuesday.</p>

<p>"If the Zionist regime reacts to Iranian operations, it will face crushing attacks," the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps said in a statement carried by the Fars news agency.</p>

<p>On Tuesday evening, Iran launched a missile attack targeting Israel's commercial hub Tel Aviv, state media reported.</p>

<p>The United States had spoken of an imminent Iranian ballistic missile attack against Israel and warned it would have "severe" consequences for Tehran.</p>

<p>Iranian media carried online footage of what they said were missiles being launched against Israel.</p>

<p>State television played joyful songs over the footage and its anchor congratulated "the brave Iranian people".</p>

<p>Tuesday's attack was Iran's second on Israel after a a missile and drone attack in April in retaliation for a deadly Israeli air strike on the Iranian consulate in Damascus.</p>

<p>Nearly all the munitions fired in that attack were intercepted by Israel or its allies.</p>

<p>An Israeli strike on Beirut on Friday killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, whose Lebanese militant group has been armed and financed by the Islamic republic for years.</p>

<p>Nasrallah was killed alongside General Abbas Nilforoushan, a top commander of the Quds Force, the Guards' foreign operations arm.</p>

<p>Iran vowed Nilforoushan's killing "will not go unanswered".</p>

<p>At the UN General Assembly in New York last month, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian accused Israel of warmongering while Iran had exercised restraint.</p>

<p>He suggested Iran had held back retaliation for the killing of Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran in July, fearing it could derail US-backed efforts for a Gaza ceasefire.</p>

<p>"We tried to not respond. They kept telling us we were within reach of peace, perhaps in a week or so," he said.</p>

<p>On Sunday, Pezeshkian said promises by the US and its allies of a "ceasefire in exchange for Iran's non-reaction to Haniyeh's killing were completely false".</p>

<p>He added that "giving these criminals (Israel) a chance would only encourage them to commit more crimes."</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Amid escalating tensions in West Asia (Middle East), the Indian Embassy in Israel has cautioned all Indians to stay vigilant and follow safety protocols advised by local authorities. The advisory was issued within hours of Iran threatening an attack on Israel in the aftermath of Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah being killed in an Israeli missile attack.</p>

<p>Iran followed up on the threat by launching over a hundred rockets at Israel, Iran's state media confirmed. Israel's defence forces said that its nationals were already in bunkers, taking shelter from the attack.</p>

<p>The nearly year-long conflict between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza strip has intensified with Tel Aviv going after Hezbollah - an Iran-backed militant organisation which supports Hamas. Iran had vowed to avenge the killing of Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah, killed last week, and had warned Israel of an imminent ballistic missile attack against it.</p>

<p>"In view of the prevailing situation in the region, all Indian nationals in Israel are advised to stay vigilant and adhere to safety protocols as advised by the local authorities," The Indian Embassy in Tel Aviv said in its advisory.</p>

<p>"Please exercise caution, avoid unnecessary travel within the country and stay close to safety shelters," it added.</p>

<p>The Embassy also shared round-the-clock helpline numbers where Indian nationals can call in case of emergency. "The Embassy is closely monitoring the situation and remains in regular touch with Israeli authorities to ensure the safety of all our nationals," it said, adding, "In case of any emergency, please contact the 24x7 helpline of the Embassy - +972-547520711 and +972-543278392."</p>

Iran said the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/rockets-fired-from-iran-on-israel-civilians-hiding-in-bomb-shelters-says-israel-defence-forces-6694961">attack on Israel </a>was a response to the killings of Guards commander and other leaders.</p>

<p>The Israel's military later sounded the all-clear and said Israelis were free to leave their shelters. It vowed retaliation against Iran "at place and time we decide".</p>

<p>The Iran Guards, meanwhile, threatened 'crushing attacks' if Israel responded to the missile attack.</p>

<p>Earlier, the Israel military had announced that any ballistic missile strike from Iran was expected to be widespread and told the public to shelter in safe rooms in the event of an attack.</p>

<p>The firing of missiles came after Israeli troops launched ground raids into Lebanon, in the biggest escalation of regional warfare since fighting erupted in Gaza a year ago.<br />

<p>The Israeli foreign ministry said at 10.08 pm IST that the missiles were fired a "short while ago". An hour later, around 11.10 pm, the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) said there was no more threat from Iran "for now" and civilians could leave bomb shelters, adding that there were a few "hits" during the barrage.</p>

<p>Confirming the attack, Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps&nbsp;said it was in response to the killing of Nasrallah, Hamas political chief Ismail Haniyeh and its own senior commander Abbas Nilforoushan.</p>

<p>The Revolutionary Guards also threatened to carry out "crushing attacks" against Israel if it retaliated after the attack. "If the Zionist regime reacts to Iranian operations, it will face crushing attacks," it said in a statement carried by Iranian news agency Fars, according to news agency AFP.&nbsp;The Revolutionary Guards claimed the attacks were "in accordance with the United Nations Charter" and came "after a period of restraint".</p>

<p>Iran-backed Iraqi armed groups said US bases in Iraq and the region would be targeted if the United States joined any response to Iranian strikes on Israel or if Israel used Iraqi airspace against Tehran, news agency Reuters reported. Hamas praised the attacks as "heroic" and celebrations were reported in Beirut.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>'Will Have Consequences'</strong></p>

<p>Israel vowed to retaliate to the Iranian attack, with IDF Spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari&nbsp;saying the country would respond at a time and place of its choosing.</p>

<p>"This attack will have consequences. We have plans, and we will operate at the place and time we decide," he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While the attack was taking place, US President Joe Biden ordered the country's military to "aid Israel's defence" and shoot down Iranian missiles targeting its ally. A White House statement said&nbsp; Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, who is the Democratic nominee in next month's US presidential election, were both monitoring Iran's attack on Israel from the White House situation room, AFP reported. The agency said some missiles had also been intercepted by neighbouring Jordan.</p>

<p>Videos showed debris from missiles intercepted by Israel's famed Iron Dome and Arrow defence systems raining down on Tel Aviv. The Israeli Defence Forces also confirmed that blasts had been heard in "Jerusalem and elsewhere".</p>

<p>"Currently, there are no reports of injuries from the fire towards Israel, except for two light injuries from shrapnel in the Tel Aviv area and some minor injuries nationwide while moving to safe spaces," a statement from Israeli emergency services said. A local governor in the West Bank said a Palestinian had been killed after being hit by shrapnel from an Iranian missile.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Air traffic was halted at Israel's Ben Gurion airport and the country closed its airspace and diverted flights, a spokesman from the airport authority said. The aviation authorities in Jordan and Iraq also announced the suspension of air traffic while&nbsp;Iran suspended flights at Tehran International Airport.</p>

<p><strong>'Remain Alert'</strong></p>

<p>As the attack began, the Israeli foreign ministry's handle said in a post on X, "A short while ago, missiles were launched from Iran towards the State of Israel. Israelis are instructed to remain alert and precisely follow the Home Front Command's instructions."&nbsp;</p>

<p>"In the last few minutes, the Home Front Command has distributed life-saving instructions in various areas across the country. The IDF is doing and will do everything necessary to protect the civilians of the State of Israel," it said.</p>

<p>IDF Spokesperson Hagari asked citizens to remain vigilant and asked them to enter a protected space as soon as they heard a siren and remain there until they got further instructions.</p>

<p>"The air defense system is fully operational, detecting and intercepting threats wherever necessary, even at this moment. However, the defense is not hermetic, and therefore it is essential to follow the Home Front Command's instructions. You may hear explosions, which could be the result of interceptions or impacts," he said in a statement.</p>

<p>"The IDF is doing and will continue to do everything necessary to protect the civilians of Israel. The IDF is fully prepared for both defense and offense at peak readiness," he added.</p>

<p>The news of the missiles being launched came shortly after reports of a suspected "terror" shooting in Israel's commercial capital Tel Aviv. Police in the city said at least six people were killed.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Broadening Conflict</strong></p>

<p>After Iran's attack, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemned the "broadening conflict in the Middle East".</p>

<p>Expressing concern over "escalation after escalation" in the region, Mr Guterres said: "This must stop. We absolutely need a ceasefire."</p>

<p>Iran had also launched missiles and drones at Israel on 13 April in retaliation for the Israeli bombing of its embassy in Damascus, in which two Iranian generals were killed. The projectiles were shot down by Israeli, American, British, French and Jordanian air forces. The strike did not cause much damage and, the next day, Iran said the attacks could be "deemed concluded".</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At least six people were killed and nine wounded in a suspected shooting and stabbing terror attack in Tel Aviv on Tuesday, Israeli police said.</p>

<p>They said two "terrorists" started a killing spree on the Tel Aviv light rail and continued on foot before being killed by civilians and inspectors using personal pistols. There has been no claim of responsibility but Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said they were Palestinians from the West Bank city of Hebron.</p>

<p>The hardline Smotrich said he will demand of the cabinet that members of the suspects' families be deported to Gaza and their homes destroyed.</p>

<p>The attack took place minutes before Iran launched a barrage of missiles at Israel.</p>

<p>TV footage showed gunmen getting off at a light rail station and opening fire.</p>

<p>Israel's MDA ambulance service said it received a report at 7:01 p.m. (1601 GMT) of people injured by gunfire.</p>

<p>Medics and paramedics provided on-site treatment to a number of wounded people with varying degrees of injuries, including some who were unconscious, MDA said.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[It's believed that the portrait is of Dora Maar, a French photographer and painter who was Picasso's mistress and muse.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A junk dealer's discovery in a Capri cellar has turned out to be an original Picasso portrait. According to a <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2024/oct/01/painting-found-by-junk-dealer-in-cellar-is-original-picasso-experts-claim">Guardian</a></em> report, Luigi Lo Rosso found the painting in 1962, took it home to Pompeii, and hung it in his living room despite his wife's distaste for it. For decades, the painting remained a mystery, until Lo Rosso's son Andrea started researching art history and noticed the distinctive signature in the top left corner.&nbsp;The family then sought the advice of a team of experts, including a well-known art detective, Maurizio Seracini.&nbsp;Cinzia Altieri, a graphologist and member of the Arcadia Foundation's scientific committee, confirmed the painting's distorted style as classic Picasso. The art piece is now valued at 5 million pounds (Rs&nbsp;55,71,18,527).</p>

<p>''After all the other examinations of the painting were done, I was given the job of studying the signature. I worked on it for months, comparing it with some of his original works. There is no doubt that the signature is his. There was no evidence suggesting that it was false,'' Mr Altieri told the <em>Guardian.</em>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It's believed that the portrait is of Dora Maar, a French photographer and painter who was Picasso's mistress and muse.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Lo Ross died, but his son Andrea, who is 60 now, pursued his quest to discover the artist behind the painting.</p>

<p>''My father was from Capri and would collect junk to sell for next to nothing. He found the painting before I was even born and didn't have a clue who Picasso was. He wasn't a very cultured person. I kept telling my father it was similar, but he didn't understand. But as I grew up, I kept wondering,''&nbsp;Andrea Lo Rosso told The <em>Guardian.</em></p>

<p>Mr Rosso also revealed that his family considered disposing of the painting due to his mother's strong dislike. "She found it repulsive and repeatedly urged us to get rid of it," he added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>His quest to validate his father's discovery faced a significant hurdle when the Picasso Foundation in Málaga repeatedly dismissed his claims as false. Despite this setback, experts, including graphologist Cinzia Altieri, have now confirmed the painting's authenticity.</p>

<p>Notably, Picasso frequently visited Capri, where the painting was discovered, and the estimated creation period between 1930 and 1936 aligns with his stylistic evolution. Notably, Picasso created over 14,000 works during his lifetime, leaving room for unknown pieces to emerge.</p>

<p>The painting, now stored in a Milan vault, awaits official recognition from the Picasso Foundation.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The repeated blasts in Beirut's southern suburbs where Israel has been carrying out airstrikes this week have driven Zeina Nazha and her young daughter to camp on a city beach seeking safety from the war in Lebanon.</p>

<p>She and some others from those suburbs, known as Dahiyeh, a stronghold of Israel's Iran-backed foe Hezbollah, are sleeping on blankets either under the open sky or in tents and other makeshift shelters with no safer place to go.</p>

<p>Israel's stepped-up military campaign in Lebanon over the past two weeks has driven a million people from their homes in the south, in Beirut and in the Bekaa valley in the east, according to the Lebanese government.</p>

<p>Israel says its campaign is necessary to make its own northern regions safe from Hezbollah rocket fire and allow thousands of its citizens home.</p>

<p>"There was bombing in al-Sallem neighbourhood. We stayed for a while there and my family fled," said Nazha.</p>

<p>"The situation we're living in is very difficult... people are dying," she added.</p>

<p>She and her daughter spent a night sleeping on the corniche, the seaside walk around central areas of Beirut that in peaceful times is a hub of city life, filled with families strolling or sitting and eating.</p>

<p>The government and private or charitable bodies have set up numerous shelters in schools and other facilities to accommodate people displaced by the fighting. But Nazha said all those she had visited were full up.</p>

<p>Nearby, Mohamed Terkmene, a Syrian man living in Lebanon who has also been displaced by the conflict, said he had been sleeping at the beach for four days. He said soldiers had come to tell him and his neighbours to evacuate their Dahiyeh homes.</p>

<p>"We are not able to sleep and we don't know for how long we will stay here. A month, two months, a week or two, until this war is resolved," he said.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[The Quad, a strategic security grouping which was formed to maintain peace, stability and freedom of navigation in the Indo-Pacific region, is facing a major challenge from an unofficial, unnamed alliance led by China.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Quad, a strategic security grouping which was formed to maintain peace, stability and freedom of navigation in the Indo-Pacific region, is facing a major challenge from an unofficial, unnamed alliance led by China, especially after the chronology of events in recent months leading up to, and beyond the latest Quad Summit in the United States.</p>

<p>The Quad, short for the Quadrilateral, is a group comprising India, the United States, Japan, and Australia. The grouping was formed with an aim to maintain security and freedom of navigation in the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean. The Quad was first set up in 2007, but ceased to exist in 2008 following the withdrawal of Australia. The group was re-established in 2017 by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, then US President Donald Trump, then Japanese PM Shinzo Abe, and then Australian PM Malcolm Turnbull.</p>

<p>China, which considers the grouping a threat to its expansionist policies in the South China Sea, Indian Ocean and Pacific Ocean regions, is now leading an unofficial, unnamed group to counter the Quad. The group comprises of China, Russia, Iran and North Korea.</p>

<p>Russia, which is facing an isolation from the West, especially United States and most of Europe over the Ukraine war, finds itself in a situation where it is heavily dependant on China, both economically as well as supply of select weaponry. Iran and North Korea too, find itself under heavy US sanctions and find itself in depending significantly on China.</p>

<p>Beijing, which aims to replace the United States as the leading global power, is leading its assertive, aggressive and expansionist policies by leveraging the ally's which are dependant on it.</p>

<h2><strong>Here are the chronology of provocative events led by China to send a message to the Quad:</strong></h2>

<h3><strong>MESSAGE TO THE UNITED STATES</strong></h3>

<p>China launched an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) from its territory deep into the Pacific Ocean on September 25, the first such test since 1980. The launch came days after the annual Quad Leaders' Summit was held in Delaware in the US. The ICBM can reportedly target any location in the US in less than 30 minutes.</p>

<p>Beijing has downplayed the incident calling the test - a first in 44 years - "routine".</p>

<p>China's Ministry of National Defence or MND said, "The People's Liberation Army Rocket Force (PLARF) launched an ICBM carrying a dummy warhead to the high seas in the Pacific Ocean at 08:44 on September 25th, and the missile fell into expected sea areas. This test launch is a routine arrangement in our annual training plan. It is in line with international law and international practice, and is not directed against any country or target."</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-10/ja1odglo_china-icbm-reuters-_625x300_01_October_24.jpeg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>The missile hit the desired target near the exclusive economic zone of French Polynesia, not far from the Marquesas Islands. China sent its Yuan Wang 5 tracking ship near the landing site to collect data. New Zealand described the ICBM test as an "unwelcome and concerning development". The US Air Force too deployed an RC-135S Cobra Ball aircraft to collect optical and electronic data on the missile and its warhead about halfway along its flight path.</p>

<p>The ICBM's desired target was 12,000km from the launch site. The distance between China's Hainan Island and Los Angeles in the US is just 12,100km. China therefore effectively demonstrated its ability to reach the US with this type of nuclear weapon in under 30 minutes. Beijing's newer DF-41 has an even longer range.</p>

<p>This latest provocative test came at a time of heightened tensions with neighbours like Japan, the Philippines and Taiwan.</p>

<p>Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs immediately tweeted, "PLA's 1st ICBM launch in 44 years exposes the regime's expansionist ambitions &amp; malign nature. Taiwan vehemently condemns the PRC for its reckless moves destabilising the region &amp; urges China to exercise restraint &amp; cease all actions that undermine global efforts for peace." This was more than a routine test. China was sending a signal, an intimidating one at that, Teipei said.</p>

<p>China has a 2009 agreement with Russia for each side to notify the other of ballistic missile launches, but so far China has rejected all such suggestions for a similar mechanism with the US.</p>

<h3><strong>MESSAGE TO JAPAN</strong></h3>

<p>On September 21 - the day that the Quad Summit was held in the US - China began joint naval exercises in the Sea of Japan. Russia's Pacific Fleet had said, "A joint detachment of warships of the Pacific Fleet and Chinese Navy set out from Vladivostok to conduct the joint Russian-Chinese "Beibu/Interaction - 2024" naval exercise," adding that the naval exercises will include anti-aircraft and anti-submarine weapons.</p>

<p>Two days into the joint naval exercise near Japan, Tokyo protested a major provocation by Moscow, when a Russian patrol aircraft entered Japan's airspace - not once, not twice, but three times. Japan's Defence Minister Minoru Kihara had said, "We confirmed today that a Russian Il-38 patrol aircraft has violated our airspace over our territorial waters north of Rebun Island, Hokkaido, on three occasions."</p>

<p class="ins_instory_dv_caption"><em>Japan had scrambled its F-35 fighter jets to warn the Russian military. (Photo: Lockheed Martin)</em></p>
</div>

<p>Japan had scrambled its F-15 and F-35 fighter jets to warn the Russian military over radio during the first two airspace breaches. Finally the Japanese Air Force jets had to resort to firing flares when the third incursion happened. This even prompted Tokyo to call Moscow through diplomatic channels to ensure such provocation doesn't happen again. The Russian government has not commented on the air incursions.</p>

<p>A similar incident happened a month earlier, in August, when Japan had to fly out its air force jets when Chinese military aircraft entered its airspace. Tokyo had warned Beijing, calling it a "serious violation of our sovereignty."</p>

<p>The China-Russia joint naval drill was also the "largest of its kind for three decades," Vladimir Putin had said.</p>

<p>In the aftermath of these China-backed provocations, Japan, Australia and New Zealand sent a strong message to Beijing as their naval ships passed through the Taiwan Strait. JS Sazanami's, a destroyer of the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force and a navel vessel each from Australia and New Zealand - the HMAS Sydney (DDG 42) and HMNZS Endeavour (A11) - transited the Strait of Taiwan. This was the first ever that such an incident by Japan, Australia and New Zealand took place.</p>

<p>China reportedly sent five of its naval ships to close proximity of the Australian and New Zealand ships and carried out surveillance activity.</p>

<p>With regard to the incident by Japan, Beijing issued a statement via its foreign office spokesperson, who said, "China's response to Japanese Maritime SDF vessel's passing through the Taiwan Strait: The Taiwan question is a red line that must not be crossed. Japan must honor its commitment and be prudent on this issue, and not create disturbance for China-Japan ties and cross-Strait peace."</p>

<h3><strong>CHALLENGE TO FREEDOM ON NAVIGATION IN INDIAN OCEAN</strong></h3>

<p>China, Russia and Iran have also increased their cooperation and activities in West Asia (Middle East). Last year, Beijing brokered a deal between Saudi Arabia and Iran, highlighting its presence in the Middle East. Both Beijing and Moscow have also condemned the killing of Iran-backed Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah, in a stand against Israel.</p>

<p>Russia and Iran are also reportedly negotiating terms to arming Houthis in Yemen who are targeting merchant shipping vessels in and around the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden. However, they are not targeting Chinese and Russian ships, reports suggest. With a rise in the number of attacks by Houthis, it poses a massive threat to freedom of navigation in the Indian Ocean.</p>

<p>Iran-backed and Yemen-based Houthi terrorists have attacked and hijacked ships in the region for many months, affecting the global trade and maritime operations. These incidents are on the rise amid Israel's ongoing war against Hamas and Hezbollah, both backed by Iran.</p>

<p>According to the US Maritime Administration, Houthis have launched over 50 attacks on shipping, resulting in casualties, vessel seizures, and disruptions to global trade routes. The campaign has forced shipping firms to seek alternative routes, impacting approximately 12 per cent of global trade that traverses the Red Sea.</p>

<h3><strong>THE NORTH KOREA THREAT</strong></h3>

<p>In the last few months, North Korea, which is reportedly backed by Beijing, has fired multiple ballistic missiles at the US, Japan and South Korea.</p>

<p>The projectiles were believed to have fallen into the sea. The development comes in the wake of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un seen inspecting a uranium enrichment facility in mid-September.</p>

<p>The US Indo-Pacific Command in statement said it was aware of Pyongyang's "ballistic missile launches and are consulting closely" with South Korea and Japan, as well as other regional allies and partners.</p>

<p>"The United States condemns these actions and calls on the DPRK to refrain from further unlawful and destabilizing acts. While we have assessed that this event does not pose an immediate threat to US personnel, or territory, or to our allies, we continue to monitor the situation," it said in a statement.</p>

<p>A New York Times report has said that US President Joe Biden had in March this year approved a classified document ordering US forces to prepare for possible coordinated nuclear confrontations with Russia, China and North Korea.</p>

<p>Amid these developments, Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has said that Japan faces its "most severe" regional security situation in the post-WWII era. "The security environment surrounding our country is the most severe since the end of World War II," he said last month in his first speech as prime minister.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iran is preparing an imminent ballistic missile attack against Israel, the United States said on Tuesday, warning that any such assault would have "severe" consequences for Tehran.</p>

<p>The warning came as Israel said it had launched a ground offensive in Lebanon to target the Iran-backed militia Hezbollah, whose leader Hassan Nasrallah was killed in an Israeli air strike last week.</p>

<p>"The United States has indications that Iran is preparing to imminently launch a ballistic missile attack against Israel," a senior White House official told AFP on condition of anonymity.</p>

<p>"We are actively supporting defensive preparations to defend Israel against this attack."</p>

<p>The United States and other western allies stepped in to help defend Israel against a combined Iranian missile and drone attack in April, which Tehran launched in retaliation for an Israeli strike on the Iranian consulate in Damascus.</p>

<p>The US official added: "A direct military attack from Iran against Israel will carry severe consequences for Iran."</p>

<p>Iran has said that Nasrallah's killing would bring about Israel's "destruction," though the foreign ministry said Monday that Tehran would not deploy soldiers to confront Israel.</p>

<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu meanwhile issued a stark warning to Iran on Monday, saying there was "nowhere in the Middle East Israel cannot reach."</p>

<p>Netanyahu also said that a future "when Iran is finally free" would "come a lot sooner than people think".</p>

<p>An attack on Israel by Iran would gravely compound fears of a wider regional conflict that the United States and other world powers have said they want to avoid in the Middle East.</p>

<p>The United States has cautiously backed Israel's move to dismantle Hezbollah's ability to attack northern Israel, even as President Joe Biden has called for a ceasefire.</p>

<p>US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that Washington was "tracking events in the Middle East very closely."</p>

<p>"The United States is committed to Israel's defense," Blinken said Tuesday morning while meeting his Moroccan counterpart Nasser Bourita at the State Department.</p>

<p>Washington said Monday that it was boosting its forces in the Middle East by a "few thousand" troops, by bringing in new units while extending others that are already there.</p>

<p>It was also deploying more fighter jets, the Pentagon said.</p>

<p>US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin late Monday offered support to his Israeli counterpart Yoav Gallant for "dismantling attack infrastructure" belonging to Hezbollah along the border with Lebanon.</p>

<p>Hezbollah began low intensity strikes on Israeli troops a day after its Palestinian ally Hamas, which is also backed by Iran, staged its unprecedented attack on Israel on October 7, which triggered Israel's devastating assault on the Gaza Strip.</p>

<p>Cross-border fire from Israel and Hezbollah continued throughout Israel's war in Gaza.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli forces have been carrying out raids into southern Lebanon for months, uncovering Hezbollah tunnels and weapon caches under homes and uncovering invasion plans by the group, Israeli military spokesman Daniel Hagari said on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Hagari said the details were being declassified, hours after Israel announced a ground operation against the Iran-backed Hezbollah in southern Lebanon.</p>

<p>Dozens of such operations had uncovered detailed plans by Hezbollah to enter Israel and carry out an attack similar to the one led by the Palestinian Hamas in southern Israel on October 7 last year.</p>

<p>"Our soldiers entered Hezbollah's underground infrastructure; exposed Hezbollah's hidden weapons caches and seized and destroyed the weapons including advanced, Iranian-made weapons," Hagari said.</p>

<p>The findings and evidence discovered under homes in villages in southern Lebanon during the raids will be presented to the international community, Hagari said.</p>

<p>Hagari showed videos filmed on troops' body-cameras from what he said were Hezbollah tunnels under three Lebanese villages that lie across the border from three Israeli towns. The forces also found maps marking Israeli communities and army posts, he said.</p>

<p>"The operations that we de-classified tonight are only a small number of dozens of operations that we will reveal going forward, including the destruction of Hezbollah's strategic assets and capabilities," he said.</p>

<p>Hagari said that the ground raids would continue until tens of thousands of uprooted Israelis living near the border are able to return safely to their homes, but that the military's aim was to complete them as fast as they can.</p>

<p>"We're not going to Beirut. We're not going to the cities in southern Lebanon. We are focusing on the area of those villages next to our border," said Hagari.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Survivors of the monsoon floods that ravaged Nepal at the weekend criticised the government on Tuesday for inadequate relief efforts during a disaster that killed at least 225 people.</p>

<p>Deadly floods and landslides are common across South Asia during the monsoon season from June to September but experts say climate change is making them worse.</p>

<p>Entire neighbourhoods in the capital Kathmandu were inundated at the weekend, along with villages in remote pockets of the Himalayan country that were still awaiting relief efforts.</p>

<p>"There is no road, so no one has come," Mira KC, who lives in a village in Kavre district to Kathmandu's east, told AFP.</p>

<p>"Even if they do, those who died are dead already and the damage is done. All they will do is offer condolences, what will they do?"</p>

<p>The floods disproportionately hit Kathmandu's poorest residents living in haphazard slums along the banks of the Bagmati river and its tributaries, which run through the city.</p>

<p>Slum resident Man Kumar Rana Magar, 49, told AFP that authorities had provided shelter at a school for him and his neighbours after their homes were inundated.</p>

<p>However, he said they had been forced to leave before they were ready to return to their homes when the school reopened for classes.</p>

<p>"We are so close to the seat of the government. If they cannot take care of the poor this close, what will they do about others?" he said.</p>

<p>At least 225 people were killed in the floods, with another 24 still missing, according to police. More than 4,000 others were rescued.</p>

<p>Nepal's weather bureau said preliminary data showed 240 millimetres (9.4 inches) of rain fell in the 24 hours to Saturday morning, the biggest single-day downpour in more than two decades.</p>

<p><strong>'Precautions ignored'</strong></p>

<p>Experts said authorities did not prepare adequately for the disaster despite forecasts of intense storms.</p>

<p>"Precautions that should have been taken were ignored," climate expert Arun Bhakta Shrestha, of Kathmandu-based think tank International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development, told AFP.</p>

<p>Nepali disaster management expert Man Bahadur Thapa said gaps in coordination and resources had also hindered the rescue process.</p>

<p>"We could have saved a lot more lives if we prepared and built the capacity of our responders," he told AFP.</p>

<p>Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli was visiting the United States during the floods and was roundly criticised on social media for not cutting his trip short when the scale of the disaster became clear.</p>

<p>"At a sensitive time like this we all have to work together realistically, not criticise just for the sake of it," he told reporters on his return to Nepal on Monday.</p>

<p>Monsoon rains bring widespread death and destruction in the form of floods and landslides across South Asia every year.</p>

<p>Experts say climate change has worsened their frequency and intensity.</p>

<p>More than 300 people have been killed in rain-related disasters in Nepal this year.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p><em><strong>(The following is an excerpt from the book 'Inside the Terrifying World of Jaish-e-Mohammed' by Abhinav Pandya. The book examines the JeM's origins, ideology, organisational structure, financing, strategies, radicalisation methods and more.)</strong></em></p>

<p>After his arrest, it took the authorities some time to ascertain Masood Azhar's real identity for he was carrying a Portuguese passport. He was interrogated several times by the IB, R&amp;AW and the J&amp;K state police. Later, after five Western backpackers were kidnapped in Kashmir by Al Faran (a splinter group of the HuA) in a bid to release Masood, the FBI also interrogated him. In his interrogations, he displayed a mild and cooperative demeanour.</p>

<p>He gave the impression of a religious scholar and an intellectual. With his long experience in journalism, he was smooth in his interviews with the media too; however, he was not comfortable giving interviews to female journalists. He did not look into their eyes because it was deemed un-Islamic.</p>

<p>Chanchal Singh, the jail superintendent at Kot Bhalwal Jail at the time of Masood's release, said that he was treated like an ordinary terrorist. He was kept in a different cell, separate from HM terrorist Mushtaq Zargar and another Jaish militant Omar Saed Sheikh, his aides, who were also released with him. However, some officers suggest he was addressed as 'Azhar sahab' in the jail. Mostly, the jail staff say, he prayed in his cell and distributed small amulets (<em>taweez</em>) to jail inmates. Sometimes, visitors came to him for spiritual healing - looking for relief from their medical and family issues. It is believed that Masood began sermonising in jail and radicalised some of his fellow inmates.</p>

<h2><strong>When Masood Feigned Ignorance About Another Terrorist</strong></h2>

<p>Avinash Mohananey, a former Intelligence Bureau (IB) official who interrogated Masood, revealed that his initial confessions were about how Deobandi clerics inspired him. He said that Masood was very communicative and forthcoming in sharing knowledge about Pakistan's jihadi groups and their networks, including how they recruited terrorists, their training and the ISI's role. However, he feigned ignorance about Omar Saed Sheikh, who had already led a failed attempt, along with Ilyas Kashmiri, to get Masood released by kidnapping three British and one American national from Delhi in October 1994.</p>

<p>Delhi Police arrested Omar Saed Sheikh while Ilyas Kashmiri escaped, becoming one of the most lethal terrorists, masterminding Musharraf's assassination plot later. Omar Saed Sheikh's growing importance and popularity disturbed Masood's inflated ego. Mohananey says Masood feigned ignorance about Omar Saed Sheikh because he might not have actually known him. However, he might have also done it because of his expertise in the tradecraft of terrorism. He shared many generic things about the jihadi landscape but cleverly hid what mattered. During my own field research in Kashmir, I interviewed many militants and OGWs (overground workers), presently or formerly associated with terrorist groups. I found it a common tendency among them to be liberal in sharing generic information about jihadi organisations' clandestine worlds, which may impress a person who is not an insider. However, they never shared anything substantial about operational details.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Why He Was Disappointed With Pak Organisation</strong></h2>

<p>Masood was highly disappointed with his organisation in Pakistan for providing him with a misleading picture of the ground realities in Kashmir that led to his arrest. He also severely criticised the returning mujahids, called '<em>ghazis</em>' (victors) in Pakistan, for narrating all kinds of false stories of how Kashmir was on the verge of freedom, and the Indian forces were demoralised and on the back foot. In his interrogations, he said, 'I had imagined an Afghanistan-like situation, where mujahideen groups created a liberated belt, and one could travel to and from Pakistan without much difficulty. On the contrary, I found <em>mujahideens </em>on the continuous run, avoiding security forces.'</p>

<p>Mohananey also said that Masood was aware and boastful about his importance. He apparently claimed that when he landed at Heathrow Airport in London, a massive crowd of followers came to see him, resulting in a two-hour traffic jam. Masood further said that he was too important for Pakistan and that India would not be able to keep him in prison for long. Masood knew that his ability to infuse a highly radical and violent jihadi fervour in Kashmir made him indispensable to the ISI. His ego was hurt when Al Faran, during the second kidnapping attempt (July 1995), demanded the release of HuJI chief Nasrullah Manzoor Langaryal, along with him, in exchange for four foreign nationals. He felt it eroded his stature and importance as Nasrallah was a mere 'foot soldier, a person of low intellect', in his view.</p>

<h2><strong>Why Relations Strained With Sajjad Afghani</strong></h2>

<p>Masood was unfit for a combat role ever since the beginning of his career as a mujahideen. He travelled by plane into India using a Portuguese passport because he could not cross into Kashmir from the snowy and mountainous LoC on foot. His physique stopped him from running away and therefore, he was arrested in Anantnag. Initially, after his arrest, Sajjad Afghani told the police that they had nothing to do with each other. However, Masood, not used to handling physical torture, gave away the identity of his colleague in thirty minutes - right after an army soldier slapped him. He allegedly said, 'My father had never slapped me, but for the first time, an army jawan did so even before asking me any question.' Their relations remained strained the entire time they were jailed together because Masood had revealed Sajjad's identity to the Indian Army.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A zookeeper in Nigeria was mauled to death by a lion after he failed to secure the locks on its enclosure when he went to feed it. According to the <em>BBC</em>, the victim, identified as a 35-year-old man named Babaji Daule, worked at the Presidential Library Wildlife Park, owned by former Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo in Abeokuta. He was bitten in the neck on Saturday after agreeing to take guests into the enclosure even though they arrived after hours at the wildlife park.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The zookeeper, apparently, feeling comfortable with the animal, left the safety protection gate open and proceeded to feed the animal. He was mauled by the animal and died on the spot," the park management said in a statement, per the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3e9zv1ypxko" rel="noindex, nofollow">outlet</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Separately, local police spokesperson Omolola Odutola said that the "lion inflicted serious fatal injuries to the man's neck". He said that the lion was shot dead "to release its grip on the handler".&nbsp;</p>

<p>"It is important to state that this activity fell completely outside the standard feeding routine of the park," the wildlife park stressed in its statement.</p>

<p>The police described the 35-year-old as a trained lion handler. It is not clear if Mr Daule had permission to take the guests into the closure when it was supposed to be closed. Either way, he "carelessly neglected to secure the locks and barricade the lion's enclosure before approaching the cage to feed the animal," Mr Odutola said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"This negligence allowed the lion to escape and attack the handler, resulting in fatal injuries to the handler's neck and eventual death. The wild lion was shot to release its grip on the handler," he added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The management of the wildlife park expressed condolences to the deceased's family, and reassured the public of its commitment to ensuring the safety of its employees, visitors, and the animals themselves, the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/09/30/world-news/zookeeper-mauled-to-death-by-lion-while-feeding-it-after-hours/" rel="noindex, nofollow"><em>New York Post</em></a> reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, this incident comes less than a year after another zookeeper was attacked and killed by a lion at the Obafemi Awolowo University, in Nigeria. Olabode Olawuyi was a veterinary technologist who had been taking care of the lions since they were born on campus about nine years ago. Tragically, in February, one of the male lions killed the man when he was feeding them. His colleagues tried to save him but by the time they could do anything, one of the lions had already fatally wounded him, the university said in a statement.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A massive 43-foot-tall naked statue of Donald Trump suddenly appeared alongside the Las Vegas Strip highway over the weekend, only to vanish just as mysteriously. This gigantic effigy, dubbed "Crooked and Obscene," was strategically placed on a plot of land off a highway in Nevada, about 28 miles away from the Trump International Hotel, the <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/09/30/us-news/pop-up-exhibit-43-foot-naked-nevada-trump-effigy-vanishes-after-roadside-ruckus/">New York Post</a></em> reported. Its location was near the highway connecting Las Vegas to Salt Lake City, but far enough from main traffic points, likely due to its explicit nature.</p>

<p>The statue, made of foam over rebar and weighing around 6,000 pounds, was designed as a marionette with movable arms.&nbsp;The identity of the person or group behind the provocative installation remains unknown, and the only clue is that the landowner is a trust registered in Las Vegas.</p>

<p>A spokesperson for the anonymous artist behind the work said the installation is "43ft tall, 10ft wide… weighs 6,000lbs, and is made of foam over rebar," adding that it intended to "ignite conversations".The statue was due to be removed by Monday night and will be moved to "key swing states," the spokesperson added.</p>

<p>The mysterious artwork has generated significant attention, with mixed reactions on social media ranging from amusement to outrage. Some conservatives condemned the display and accused it of inciting violence against the former president.</p>

<p>The Nevada unit of Trump's Republican party described the pop-up as an ''offensive marionette.'' In a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nevadagop.org/press-release-the-nevada-republican-party-strongly-condemns-the-deplorable-statue-of-president-donald-j-trump/">press release,</a> the party said, ''While families drive through Las Vegas, they are forced to view this offensive marionette, designed intentionally for shock value rather than meaningful dialogue. President Trump and Republicans are focused on delivering results that matter—reducing inflation, securing our borders, creating jobs, and ensuring a brighter future for all Americans. While Democrats, especially Kamala Harris, continue to prioritize shock value over substance. President Trump is the only candidate in this race standing up for working men and women across Nevada.''</p>

<p>Interestingly, this isn't the first time a naked Trump statue has made headlines. In 2016, several similar statues popped up in cities across the US, including New York, San Francisco, and Seattle. A baby blimp of Trump was also floated in London ahead of the 2020 election.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel announced Tuesday it had launched a ground offensive targeting Hezbollah in southern Lebanon, days after killing its leader Hassan Nasrallah in an air strike on a bunker in Beirut.</p>

<p>Here is a rundown of what is known about Israel's ground operation so far.</p>

<p><strong>When did the offensive begin</strong></p>

<p>Late Monday, Israel's military began what it called "limited, localised and targeted raids" against Hezbollah in southern Lebanon's border areas.</p>

<p>Its ground forces are backed by fighter jets and artillery fire.</p>

<p>The military formally announced the start of the ground offensive hours after the United States said Israeli forces were conducting limited operations in Lebanon.</p>

<p>The military did not reveal how many soldiers were involved in the incursion, but said its 98th division - including paratroopers and commando units - was taking part.</p>

<p>The division had been previously deployed in the Gaza Strip, where Israeli forces continue to battle Palestinian militants led by Hamas.</p>

<p>On Monday evening, the military declared three areas along the northern border with Lebanon a "closed military zone", providing the first indication of a possible ground offensive.</p>

<p><strong>What are Israel's targets?</strong></p>

<p>The military said it was acting on "precise intelligence" targeting Hezbollah positions and infrastructure in southern Lebanon.</p>

<p>"These targets are located in villages close to the border and pose an immediate threat to Israeli communities in northern Israel," it said.</p>

<p>The ground assault comes after Israeli air strikes killed several top Hezbollah commanders in recent weeks, including Nasrallah on Friday.</p>

<p>"The elimination of Nasrallah is an important step, but it is not the final one," Defence Minister Yoav Gallant warned on Monday, hours before the offensive was announced.</p>

<p>"We will use all the means that may be required - your forces, other forces, from the air, from the sea, and on land," Gallant told soldiers in the north.</p>

<p><strong>What are Israel's goals?</strong></p>

<p>Since October 8, Hezbollah has been firing rockets from across the border, displacing more than 60,000 residents in northern Israel.</p>

<p>Hezbollah has said it was acting in solidarity with its Islamist ally Hamas in Gaza, following the unprecedented attack on Israel on October 7 that resulted in the deaths of 1,205 people on the Israeli side, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.</p>

<p>The ensuing cross-border clashes have intensified in recent weeks.</p>

<p>While Israel engaged in fierce fighting with Hamas in Gaza, Gallant announced on September 18 that the "centre of gravity" of the war was now pivoting to the north.</p>

<p>"It was now time to ensure that those displaced from the north would be able to return to their homes," he said.</p>

<p>Other officials including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have repeatedly vowed to return those displaced back to their homes.</p>

<p>"We will continue to hit Hezbollah... the one who has a missile in his living room and a rocket in his home will not have a home," Netanyahu said in a statement last month.</p>

<p><strong>How has Hezbollah responded?</strong></p>

<p>Since the ground offensive began, Hezbollah has fired several rockets into Israel, with explosions heard in the commercial city of Tel Aviv on Tuesday.</p>

<p>A statement said it had "launched salvoes of Fadi 4 rockets at the Glilot base of the military intelligence's unit 8200 and the Mossad headquarters located on the outskirts of Tel Aviv".</p>

<p>Hezbollah said it also targeted Israeli troop movements in Metula in northern Israel "with artillery shells" and later a "gathering of enemy soldiers" in the same area with rockets.</p>

<p>Israeli troops in northern Israel's Avivim were also targeted, the group added.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 42-year-old man from Western Australia has been charged by Australian police for allegedly setting up fraudulent Wi-Fi networks at airports and on domestic flights. The Australian Federal Police (AFP) claims that these fraudulent networks pretended to be real ones in order to obtain personal information from unwary tourists. The man was supposed to appear in court in Perth on Friday in relation to nine allegations related to cybercrime.</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-updates/incidents/man-charged-with-evil-twin-wifi-scam-at-airports-and-on-flights/news-story/a6143f56b0b060f34003bb6968e92588"><em>News Corp Australia</em></a>, police allege the man, 42, used a device in a number of locations, including airports in Perth, Melbourne, and Adelaide, and on domestic flights, to create "evil twin" copies of legitimate wi-fi networks.</p>

<p>When users tried to connect their devices to the networks, they were allegedly taken to a fake web page and required to sign in using their email or social media logins.</p>

<p>Those details were then allegedly saved to the man's devices and could be used to access more personal information, including a victim's online communications, stored images and videos, or bank details, police said.</p>

<p>The alleged scam was reported to police by an airline in April after its employees identified a suspicious wi-fi network during a domestic flight.</p>

<p>As per the news portal, AFP Western Command Cybercrime Detective Inspector Andrea Coleman said internet users should always be cautious when logging on to any public wi-fi networks.</p>

<p>"To connect to a free wi-fi network, you shouldn't have to enter any personal details - such as logging in through an email or social media account," she said.</p>

<p>Inspector Coleman said those using public hotspots should install a reputable VPN on their devices to encrypt and secure their data.</p>

<p>"When using a public network, disable file sharing, don't do anything sensitive - such as banking -while connected to it and once you finish using it, change your device settings to 'forget network'," she said.</p>

<p>"We also recommend turning off the wi-fi on your phone or other electronic devices before going out in public, to prevent your device from automatically connecting to a hotspot."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The conservative-majority US Supreme Court on Friday overturned 40 years of legal precedent to weaken the power of federal agencies, which regulate myriad issues affecting the everyday lives of Americans, from air pollution to food and drugs.</p>

<p>"Courts may not defer to an agency interpretation of the law simply because a statute is ambiguous," said the majority opinion written by Chief Justice John Roberts.</p>

<p>At the heart of the matter is a 1984 ruling in Chevron v Natural Resources Defense Council, which said judges should defer to government agencies in determining a "reasonable" interpretation of the law if the language is ambiguous.</p>

<p>At the time, the case was a win for the administration of Republican president Ronald Reagan, who accused the country's progressive federal judges of burying corporate America under masses of unnecessary and restrictive red tape.</p>

<p>But the political right has since decried the ruling, saying it unfairly empowers the central government over the judiciary and means agencies can alter the meaning of statutes, depending on who is in charge.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Biden administration will expand deportation relief and work permits to an estimated 309,000 Haitians in the country already, the US Department of Homeland Security said on Friday.</p>

<p>The administration will expand access to the Temporary Protected Status program to Haitians through February 2026 due to violence and security issues in Haiti that limit access to safety, healthcare, food and water, the department said.</p>

<p>About 264,000 Haitians in the U.S. were already covered by the program, according to the U.S. government.</p>

<p>U.S. President Joe Biden, a Democrat seeking another term in Nov. 5 elections, has walked a political tightrope when it comes to immigration, trying to step up security at the U.S.-Mexico border while also taking a more humane approach to immigrants in the U.S. illegally.</p>

<p>In a presidential debate on Thursday, Biden's Republican challenger, former President Donald Trump, criticized Biden for failing to stem high levels of illegal immigration.</p>

<p>Gang wars in Haiti have displaced over half a million people and nearly five million are facing severe food insecurity. Armed groups, which now control most of the capital, have formed a broad alliance while carrying out widespread killings, ransom kidnappings and sexual violence.</p>

<p>Under the latest move, TPS will now be available to Haitians who were in the U.S. on or before June 3.</p>

<p>The TPS program offers deportation relief and work permits to people in the U.S. whose home countries face armed conflict, natural disasters and other extraordinary events. The designations last six to 18 months but frequently are renewed.</p>

<p>As president, Trump tried to end most TPS enrollment but was blocked in federal courts.</p>

<p>Thousands of Haitian migrants crossed the U.S.-Mexico border into Del Rio, Texas, in September 2021 as part of a rise in illegal crossings after Biden took office. In recent years, the number of Haitians caught crossing illegally has plummeted as many have used new legal pathways to the U.S.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[India government bonds or government securities are set for inclusion in the global bond index from today.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>India government bonds or government securities are set for inclusion in the global bond index from today.</p>

<p>JP Morgan will add Indian government bonds to its Government Bond Index-Emerging Markets (GBI-EM) from June 28. It is the first time ever that Indian government bonds would be included in this index.</p>

<p>Government securities inclusion in the global bond index will have a positive impact on the Indian economy.</p>

<p>Indian bonds will have a 10 per cent weightage in the JP Morgan Emerging Markets Bond Index. The weightage of India's government bonds will be gradually increased in this index in a phased manner from June 28, 2024, to March 31, 2025, by one per cent each in the next 10 months.</p>

<p>JP Morgan announced the inclusion of Indian bonds in GBI-EM in September 2023, since then there has been an inflow of more than $10 billion into Indian bonds.</p>

<p>The move will enable foreign inflow to accelerate into Indian bonds. Demand for Indian government bonds will increase due to the inflow of foreign investment. This will increase the size of the Indian bond market. Besides, liquidity and efficiency will also increase.</p>

<p>Till now, only banks, insurance companies, and mutual funds have been major investors in government bonds. Now, a large number of global investors will be able to invest in Indian bonds. This will reduce the bond yield and will also reduce the cost of borrowing for the government which is expected to reduce the fiscal deficit.</p>

<p>Demand for the rupee will increase due to foreign inflow and hence it may remain strong in the coming months.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>India and the US have decided to extend a 2 per cent equalisation levy or digital tax on e-commerce supplies until June 30, the finance ministry said on Friday.</p>

<p>In a major reform of the international tax system, India and the US have joined 134 other members of the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework (including Austria, France, Italy, Spain, and the UK) in reaching an agreement on October 8, 2021, on the statement on a two-pillar solution to address the tax challenges arising from the digitalisation of the economy.</p>

<p>On October 21, 2021, the US and Austria, France, Italy, Spain, and the UK reached a political compromise on the transitional approach to the unilateral measures in force while Pillar 1 is implemented.</p>

<p>On November 24, 2021, India and the US agreed that the same terms that apply under the October 2021 Joint Statement shall apply between India and the US with respect to India's charge of 2 per cent equalisation levy on e-commerce supply of services and the US' trade action regarding the said Equalisation Levy.</p>

<p>The validity of this agreement was from April 1, 2022, till implementation of Pillar 1 or March 31, 2024, whichever is earlier.</p>

<p>On December 18, 2023, the Inclusive Framework issued a statement calling for a finalisation of the text of the Pillar 1 multilateral convention by the end of March 2024 with a view to holding a signing ceremony by the end of June 2024.</p>

<p>On February 15, 2024, the US and Austria, France, Italy, Spain, and the UK decided to extend the political compromise set forth in the October 21 Joint Statement until June 30, 2024.</p>

<p>"In light of above developments, India and the United States have decided to extend the validity of the agreement reflected in November 24 Statements until June 30, 2024. All other terms of the transitional approach remain the same," the finance ministry said in a statement.</p>

<p>India and the US will remain in close contact to ensure that there is common understanding of the respective commitment and endeavour to resolve all issues on this matter through constructive dialogue, it added.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President Ilham Aliyev of Azerbaijan scheduled snap parliamentary elections for Sept. 1 in a decree published on Friday in a widely expected move that appears unlikely to radically change the parliament's make-up.</p>

<p>Aliyev, in power since 2003, won a snap presidential election in February, and his New Azerbaijan Party, which holds 69 of 125 seats in the outgoing parliament, is expected to win a fresh majority in the oil-rich country, which has been courted by the West, Russia and Turkey.</p>

<p>Opposition deputies in parliament are loyal to Aliyev, but some opponents outside parliament say they have faced persecution after a string of independent journalists and political activists were arrested ahead of this year's presidential election, which Aliyev won with more by 92% of the vote.</p>

<p>Some of those detained faced charges for what they said were politically-motivated crimes, including smuggling. The authorities said the arrests were not political.</p>

<p>Aliyev has touted the success of a September lightning offensive which retook the former breakaway region of Nagorno-Karabakh from what Baku said were its illegitimate ethnic Armenian leaders.</p>

<p>Almost all of the region's more than 100,000 ethnic Armenians fled and Baku is now rebuilding the region amid plans to resettle it with Azerbaijanis.</p>

<p>Western energy firms such as BP operate in Azerbaijan, which is party to the "OPEC+" pact between the OPEC oil producers' club and other key exporters such as Russia to restrict output in order to support world prices.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[North Korea enforces strict control over information and entertainment, imposing severe punishments for violations.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>South Korea has said that in 2022, a 22-year-old man was publicly executed by North Korea for sharing and listening to K-pop music and South Korean films. The information is taken from testimonials of North Korean defectors that were published in a human rights report by the South Korean ministry of unification.</p>

<p>According to<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://unikorea.go.kr/nkhr/ko/ebook/index.html#page=1"> the report</a>, the man from South Hwanghae province was accused of listening to 70 K-pop songs, watching 3 South Korean films, and distributing this prohibited media.&nbsp;</p>

<p>North Korea has strict control over the information its citizens consume, includes strict rules regarding entertainment consumption, and has very harsh punishments for those who violate them.</p>

<p>The report further reveals that North Korea tightened its grip on outside culture in 2020 with a law banning "reactionary ideology and culture." This law is seen as a tool to shield citizens from Western influences, which the North Korean government considers detrimental.</p>

<p>North Korea has consistently denied accusations of human rights violations, calling them attempts to undermine its leadership.</p>

<p>The ban on K-pop is part of an effort to protect North Koreans from the negative influence of Western culture. This campaign began under the former leader, Kim Jong-il, and has become more intense under his son, Kim Jong-un.</p>

<p>In 2022, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.rfa.org/english/news/korea/fashion-05062022172129.html"><em>Radio Free Asia,</em></a> funded by the US government, reported that the regime was cracking down on "capitalist" fashion and hairstyles. This included targeting skinny jeans, T-shirts with foreign words, and dyed or long hair.</p>

<p>Experts believe that allowing South Korean popular culture to enter North Korean society could threaten the ideology that demands complete loyalty to the "infallible" Kim dynasty, which has ruled the country since its founding in 1948.</p>

<p>Despite these strict measures, the influence of South Korean culture, including recent television shows, seems unstoppable, according to a recent North Korean defector.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>While the first US presidential debate of the 2024 race dwelled little on foreign policy, a shaky performance by President Joe Biden will have America's allies steeling for the return of Donald Trump, analysts say.</p>

<p>Biden's supporters had hoped the debate would erase worries that he was too old to serve, but several lawmakers, analysts and investors said the event had given Trump a boost.</p>

<p>"Mr. Trump didn't win but Mr. Biden might have imploded," said Kunihiko Miyake, a former Japanese diplomat and now research director at the Canon Institute for Global Studies, a think tank.</p>

<p>"Unlike eight years ago, we are much more prepared, as are other European and Asian allies. Still, Mr. Trump is unpredictable."</p>

<p>For Japan and South Korea, among the closest U.S. allies in Asia, relations with Trump's administration were at times strained by his demands for more payments towards military assistance as well as trade tensions.</p>

<p>"The biggest question for Japan would be whether Trump will truly value and maintain the security alliance," said Takashi Kawakami, a professor at Japan's Takushoku University in Tokyo.</p>

<p>Peter Lee, research fellow at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul, said the debate had put into "much more stark relief" the possibility of a second Trump administration. Lee said he expected Trump to be "very tough" second time around in pressuring allies to up their defence spending.</p>

<p>Trump also started a tariff war with China, the world's second largest economy, and has floated tariffs of 60% or higher on all Chinese goods if he wins the Nov. 5 election.</p>

<p>Overseas firms dependent on U.S. markets, such as automakers, would also be wary of the heightened possibility of Trump's return given the "myriad" of tariff-related policies he imposed during his previous term, said Lee Jae-il, analyst at Eugene Investment &amp; Securities.</p>

<p>"Trump, like a trade war maniac, might not just target China but impose tariffs against other countries as well under the concept of American exceptionalism," added Stephen Lee, chief economist at Meritz Securities in Seoul.</p>

<p><strong>WAR IN UKRAINE</strong></p>

<p>In Europe, Trump's criticisms of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation and demands that other members pay more dominated his previous administration. His scepticism towards NATO is causing further anxiety this time, as Russian's war in Ukraine has brought conflict to the bloc's doorstep.</p>

<p>German Chancellor Olaf Scholz previously cheered on Biden's prospects for re-election. But on Friday a senior defence figure in the ruling coalition lamented Biden's performance and urged Democrats to find another candidate.</p>

<p>"The fact that a man like Trump could become president again because the Democrats are unable to put up a strong candidate against him would be a historic tragedy that the whole world would feel," Marie-Agnes Strack-Zimmermann, of the liberal FDP party, told the Rheinische Post paper.</p>

<p>A spokesperson for Scholz did not comment on the specifics of the debate, but stressed the chancellor valued Biden highly and that Scholz had never spoken to Trump as their terms did not overlap.</p>

<p>During the debate, Trump accused Biden of not standing up to China on trade. He also said China's Xi Jinping, North Korea's Kim Jong Un and Russia's Vladimir Putin "don't respect" Biden and that he was driving the country "into World War Three".</p>

<p>Biden retorted by saying Trump's tariff proposals would result in higher costs for American consumers, and that he "cuddles up" to the likes of Kim and Putin.</p>

<p>Putin has said it made little difference to Russia who was in the White House, and on Friday the Kremlin declined comment on what it said was an internal U.S. matter.</p>

<p>U.S. allies including Japan and Germany have in any case started laying the groundwork for a possible Trump return in recent months.</p>

<p>"The possibility of a Trump comeback may have increased. High tariffs and support for Ukraine will also bring about major changes," said Kazuhiro Maeshima from the Sophia University in Tokyo.</p>

<p>"The Japanese government has also been anticipating various developments in the event of a Trump and has been gradually taking steps to deal with them, including making contact with people close to Trump."</p>

<p><strong>'TRUMP 2.0'</strong></p>

<p>In Sydney, several Australian officials and experts had attended a workshop titled "Trump 2.0" as the debate was aired.</p>

<p>"The overwhelming feeling from today is that it was a disaster for Biden," said Peter Dean, a professor at the United States Studies Centre in Sydney who was at the workshop.</p>

<p>"The mood has changed considerably after the debate and the general view is that if you weren't preparing for a Trump 2.0 then that is the smart play and the smart move now."</p>

<p>Keir Starmer, the leader of Britain's Labour party and the frontrunner in an election due next week, was asked on BBC radio if he was concerned about Biden after the debate.</p>

<p>"I've got enough on my hands with our own election campaign at the moment...The relationship between the UK and the US is strong, it's historic, and obviously, it's above the individuals," he said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A historic letter written by Albert Einstein to former US President Franklin D Roosevelt in 1939 is going up for auction. The letter urged the US to develop its own nuclear programme in fear that Nazi Germany might be on the path to creating atomic bombs, according to the <em>BBC.</em></p>

<p>The letter is part of a collection belonging to Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen and will be sold alongside other artefacts.</p>

<p><strong><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/how-ak-47-emerged-as-weapon-of-the-century-5895531">Also Read | How AK-47 Emerged As 'Weapon Of The Century'</a></strong></p>

<p>As per the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cxxxx1w9znko">news outlet</a>, the letter urged the US to initiate its own nuclear program. President Roosevelt responded by establishing a committee, a precursor to the Manhattan Project led by J Robert Oppenheimer.</p>

</div>

<p>This project ultimately produced the atomic bombs used on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, closing World War II but also opening the door to the nuclear age.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/feature/3-99-store-vase-turns-out-to-be-2-000-year-old-mayan-artifact-5947824"><strong>Also Read | $3.99 Store Vase Turns Out To Be 1,800-Year-Old Mayan Artifact</strong></a></p>

<p>According to the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.wsj.com/style/albert-einstein-letter-fdr-auction-paul-allen-estate-12c80eb2?mod=hp_listc_pos3"><em>Wall Street Journal,</em></a> Christie's plans to ask for at least $4 million for this two-page, typed letter, which is dated August 2, 1939, and begins bluntly. "Sir, recent work in nuclear physics has made it probable that uranium may be turned into a new and important source of energy."</p>

<p>The letter isn't likely to break the $13 million record set in 2021 for one of Einstein's few surviving records detailing his theory of general relativity. But the record for any letter by Einstein is $2.8 million set in 2018 for a letter in which the physicist ruminates on God and religion.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Shares of Trump Media &amp; Technology Group rose as much as nearly 13% in premarket trading on Friday after President Joe Biden's faltering performance against Republican rival Donald Trump at the first 2024 U.S. presidential debate.</p>

<p>Biden delivered a shaky, halting performance while Trump battered him with a series of often false attacks at the debate on Thursday, as the two oldest presidential candidates ever exchanged personal insults ahead of the November election.</p>

<p>"Investors are probably going to give Trump the benefit of the doubt given how positive he was for markets in his presidency," said Ben Laidler, global markets strategist at digital brokerage eToro.</p>

<p>"If you're looking for a real-time proxy of investor expectations for the result in November, they're (Trump stocks) telling you that Trump is in pole position for this election, and he's cemented his perceived lead last night."</p>

<p>Shares of Trump Media &amp; Technology Group (TMTG), which owns Trump's social media platform Truth Social, was last up 7.3% at $39.54, while software developer Phunware, which worked on Trump's 2020 election campaign app, climbed 8.1% to $6.81.</p>

<p>Shares of video-sharing platform Rumble, popular with conservatives, edged up 0.5% to $5.7.</p>

<p>TMTG's shares have jumped about 110% this year as Trump gained momentum in his bid to become the Republican candidate in the election. The stock however came under pressure earlier this month after a jury found Trump guilty of falsifying documents to cover up a payment to silence a porn star.</p>

<p>Trump owned 64.9% of TMTG as of June 10, which is worth about $6.5 billion as of last close.</p>

<p>He had vowed to stick exclusively with Truth Social after being banned by Twitter following the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol by his supporters.</p>

<p>However, Trump returned to social media platform X, formerly Twitter, months after his ban was reversed by new owner Elon Musk.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Princess Anne, the sister of Britain's King Charles III, has been discharged from hospital where she was treated for concussion after being struck by a horse at her country estate.</p>

<p>Anne, 73, suffered concussion and minor head injuries at Gatcombe Park in southwestern England on Sunday evening and was taken to hospital in Bristol.</p>

<p>It is believed she was struck by a horse as she was walking within the protected perimeter of the sprawling estate, which hosts equestrian events.</p>

<p>The princess's medical team said at the time her injuries were consistent with a potential impact from a horse's head or legs.</p>

<p>The Princess Royal, as she is also known, is a skilled horsewoman who competed at the 1976 Montreal Olympics, and has a reputation as the hardest-working royal.</p>

<p>She has stepped in to represent Charles while he postponed public engagements during his cancer treatment, and rode at his official birthday parade earlier this month.</p>

<p>But the accident forced her to withdraw from an appearance at a state banquet on Tuesday evening for visiting Japanese Emperor Naruhito, and cancel an upcoming trip to Canada.</p>

<p>Her husband Tim Laurence was seen earlier in the week leaving Southmead Hospital in Bristol after visiting his wife.</p>

<p>He thanked the medical team at Southmead Hospital "for their care, expertise and kindness during my wife's short stay".</p>

<p>Buckingham Palace said on Monday that Anne was in hospital "as a precautionary measure for observation and was expected to make a full and swift recovery".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In May 2024, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak made a surprise snap election announcement. Now, the UK will vote on July 4 and the focus, apart from the Prime Minister's Conservative Party, is on Keir Starmer, the Labour Party's candidate and the leader of the opposition. Mr Starmer is not a firebrand politician, but the Labour Party believes his steady and dependable leadership is exactly what Britain needs after 14 years of Conservative rule. At 61, Mr Starmer is favourite to win the upcoming election.</p>

<p><strong>Here are some facts about Keir Starmer:</strong></p>

<p>1. Keir Starmer was born on September 2, 1962, in Oxted, Surrey, in a working-class family. His mother, a dedicated NHS nurse, battled a rare and severe case of rheumatoid arthritis, while his father worked as a toolmaker. Mr Starmer attended Reigate Grammar School and was the first in his family to attend university. He studied Law at Leeds University.</p>

<p>2. Before he ventured into politics, Mr Starmer was a distinguished human rights defence lawyer. Dubbed a "lefty lawyer" for his commitment to social justice, he began his career in 1987 as a barrister and co-founded Doughty Street Chambers in 1990. He specialised in human rights cases, representing clients through legal aid and pro bono work. His expertise earned him a Queen's Counsel (QC) appointment in 2002 and recognition as QC of the Year. Mr Starmer represented the "McLibel Two" in their landmark defamation suit against McDonald's. He also travelled to the Caribbean and Africa to represent defendants facing the death penalty. He also challenged the Tony Blair government's invasion of Iraq, drafting legal arguments against the war.</p>

<p>3. Mr Starmer was the legal advisor to the Northern Ireland Policing Board for five years from 2003 to 2008. This was a critical time in the region's history, following the Good Friday Agreement in 1998, which was a significant step towards peace after decades of conflict. During this time, he met his wife, Victoria, who was working for the National Health Service (NHS). The couple got married in 2007 and have two children.</p>

<p>4. In 2008, Mr Starmer was appointed Director of Public Prosecutions, leading the Crown Prosecution Service and managing its thousands of employees. During his tenure, he handled several high-profile cases, including the Stephen Lawrence murder case. His contributions to criminal justice were recognised with a knighthood conferred by the late Queen at Buckingham Palace in 2014.</p>

<p>5. Keir Starmer entered politics in 2015 as the MP for Holborn and St Pancras, quickly taking on key roles in the Labour Party. He served as Shadow Immigration Minister from 2015 to 2016. Following Jeremy Corbyn's resignation in 2019, Mr Starmer was elected the Labour Party leader in 2020. Mr Starmer promised a culture change; his mantra -- the country before the party. He opposed Britain's decision to leave the European Union but clarified that a Labour government would not rejoin the group, which now has 27 members. If elected as the country's Prime Minister, Mr Starmer promises to bring stability and change.</p>

<p>The Labour Party's manifesto focuses on key initiatives such as hiring 6,500 new teachers, expanding childcare and providing free breakfast clubs in primary schools. They aim to improve economic security by creating more stable jobs, reforming Universal Credit and strengthening housing regulations. The manifesto also talks about support for mental health in schools, reforming social care and advancing equality for women, ethnic minorities, disabled individuals and the LGBT+ community.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Indian-American entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy who dropped out of the 2024 Republican presidential race after finishing fourth in the Iowa caucuses earlier, has now taken a jibe at US President Joe Biden for his re-run.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Indian-American entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy who dropped out of the 2024 Republican presidential race after finishing fourth in the Iowa caucuses earlier, has now taken a jibe at US President Joe Biden for his re-run, and said that the debates should use commercial breaks to swap in real Democratic nominee.</p>

<p>Ramaswamy's remarks came as the debate between Biden, 81, and Trump, 78, hosted by CNN concluded on Thursday night (local time).</p>

<p>Taking to X, Ramaswamy said, "The game is now more obvious than ever: the Democrat Party served up an old man as their sacrificial lamb tonight."</p>

<p>"They should use the commercial break to swap in the real Democratic nominee," he went on to say.</p>

<p>Slamming Biden for his Presidential candidacy, and the performance during Thursday night debate, Ramaswamy said, "The only time Biden came remotely close to life in the debate is when he's talking about Trump's conviction and J6. Turns out he doesn't give a damn about the things Americans actually care about."</p>

<p>He further added saying, "They didn't drug up Biden. They lobotomized him instead."</p>

<p>Ramaswamy, who was himself a contender for the White House run, said he was "shocked by Biden's brain-dead performance" in the President debate.</p>

<p>"The fact that anyone is shocked by Biden's brain-dead performance tonight is a scathing indictment of the media which has gone to great lengths to cover this fact up for the public," Ramaswamy said.</p>

<p>On several analysts calling for replacing Biden as the nominee for Democrats, the Indian-American entrepreneur recalled how everyone called his message to the Democracy party of Biden purring an end to his candidature, as a "conspiracy theory."</p>

<p>"The media dismissed it as a "conspiracy theory" when I called for Biden to end his candidacy last fall. 8 months later, they're starting to call for it themselves," Ramaswamy wrote on X.</p>

<p>Ramaswamy had finished fourth in Iowa, according to CNN News projections, well behind Trump, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, and former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley.</p>

<p>The Iowa caucus victory was considered the first step in Donald Trump's bid to claim the Republican nomination in a third consecutive election.</p>

<p>President Joe Biden launched his re-election campaign in April 2023, describing the contest between him and Trump as a "stark choice" for voters between the continuation of democracy in America and its possible "destruction" under Trump.</p>

<p>He is the oldest president to ever hold office and would be 86 at the end of a second term. Polling shows that voters are far more concerned about Biden's age than his opponent's. But if Trump wins, he would break Biden's record as the oldest president before the end of his term.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Trump launched his bid to reclaim the White House in November 2022. He aims to reclaim the White House after his bitter exit in 2020, as he looks forward to becoming only the second commander-in-chief to win two non-consecutive terms in office.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An Indian student was arrested and deported after it came to light that he falsified documents to obtain a full scholarship. Aryan Anand, a student at Lehigh University in Pennsylvania, boasted about building "his life and career on lies" in a now-deleted Reddit post, which was later flagged by a platform moderator.</p>

<p>Anand made a stunning confession about how he used fraudulent means to secure admission to a US college with a full scholarship.</p>

<p>It included fabricating transcripts, essays, and even the death certificate of his father, who is alive.</p>

<p>Anand was arrested two months ago and faced up to 20 years in prison for felony counts of forgery and theft of services, reported <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://6abc.com/post/post-reddit-unveils-lehigh-university-student-aryan-anands/14999668/">6ABC</a>. However, at the request of university officials, he was expelled and deported to India instead.</p>

<p>Lehigh University, in a statement, said, "We appreciate the report and the thorough investigation that brought this matter to light."</p>

<p>Michael Weinert, Northampton County Assistant DA, explained how the Reddit moderator connected Anand to Lehigh University. "The defendant only had one other university that he followed, which was Lehigh University. So, the moderator reached out to Lehigh to give them a heads up," Mr Weinert said, as per 6ABC.</p>

<p>Mr Weinert praised Lehigh University's thorough investigation, saying, "It was challenging to verify the facts, but Lehigh and their police force did an excellent job of digging deep and uncovering the truth.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Polls in Iran opened on Friday for a presidential election following the death of ultraconservative president Ebrahim Raisi in a helicopter crash last month.</p>

<p>Around 61 million Iranians are eligible to vote in the polls where reformist Masoud Pezeshkian, 69, hopes for a breakthrough win against a divided conservative camp.</p>

<p>The Guardian Council, which vets candidates, allowed him to run against a field of conservatives now dominated by parliamentary speaker Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf and former nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili.</p>

<p>Also left in contention is cleric Mostafa Pourmohammadi after two ultraconservatives dropped out -- Tehran major Alireza Zakani and Raisi's former vice president Amir-Hossein Ghazizadeh Hashemi.</p>

<p>"We start the elections" for the country's 14th presidential ballot, Interior Minister Ahmad Vahidi said in a televised address.</p>

<p>Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei cast his ballot shortly after the polls opened and urged Iranians to vote.</p>

<p>"Election day is a day of joy and happiness for us Iranians," he said in a televised speech where he also called for a high turnout.</p>

<p>"We encourage our dear people to take the issue of voting seriously and participate," he said.</p>

<p>The election in sanctions-hit Iran comes at a time of high regional tensions between the Islamic Republic and its arch-foes Israel and the United States as the Gaza war rages on.</p>

<p>Polls opened at 8:00 am (0430 GMT) in 58,640 stations across the country, mostly in schools and mosques.</p>

<p>Polling stations will be open for 10 hours, though authorities could extend voting time as in previous elections.</p>

<p>Early projections of the results are expected by Saturday morning and official results by Sunday.</p>

<p>If no candidate wins 50 percent of the vote, a second round will be held on July 5, for only the second time in Iranian electoral history after the 2005 vote went to a runoff.</p>

<p>The candidacy of Pezeshkian, until recently a relative unknown, has revived cautious hopes for Iran's reformist wing after years of dominance by the conservative and ultraconservative camps.</p>

<p>Iran's last reformist president, Mohammad Khatami, praised him as "honest, fair, and caring".</p>

<p>Khatami, who served from 1997 to 2005, had also endorsed the moderate Hassan Rouhani, who won the presidency and sealed Iran's nuclear deal in 2015 with Western powers before it was derailed three years later.</p>

<h3><strong>'Resolve our problems'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>The Iranian opposition, particularly the Iranian expatriates, has called for a boycott of the vote.</p>

<p>Ultimate political power in Iran is held by Khamenei, the supreme leader.</p>

<p>Khamenei insisted this week that "the most qualified candidate" must be "the one who truly believes in the principles of the Islamic Revolution" of 1979 that overthrew the US-backed monarchy.</p>

<p>The next president, he said, must allow Iran "to move forward without being dependent on foreign countries".</p>

<p>However, Khamenei also said that Iran should not "cut its relations with the world".</p>

<p>During campaign debates, Jalili criticised the moderates for having signed the 2015 nuclear accord which promised Iran sanctions relief in return for curbs on the programme.</p>

<p>Jalili said the deal, which the United States withdrew from in 2018 under then-president Donald Trump, "did not benefit Iran at all".</p>

<p>Pezeshkian has urged efforts to salvage the agreement and lift crippling sanctions on the Iranian economy.</p>

<p>"Are we supposed to be eternally hostile to America, or do we aspire to resolve our problems with this country?" he asked.</p>

<p>The contentious issue of compulsory head covering for women also emerged during the campaign, almost two years since a vast protest movement swept the country after the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, 22.</p>

<p>An Iranian Kurd, Amini had been arrested for an alleged violation of the country's strict dress code for women.</p>

<p>In the televised debates, all candidates distanced themselves from the sometimes heavy-handed police arrests of women refusing to wear the hijab head covering in public.</p>

<p>Pourmohammadi, the only clerical candidate, said that "under no circumstances should we treat Iranian women with such cruelty."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A magnitude 7.2 earthquake struck off the coast of central Peru on Friday, the United States Geological Survey said, but a tsunami threat from the tremor has passed.</p>

<p>The USGS said the tremor hit 8.8 kilometers (5.5 miles) from Atiquipa district, raising an initial magnitude rating soon after the quake was reported.</p>

<p>The USGS said that strong shaking from the quake would have been felt in areas near the epicenter.</p>

<p>The Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre had earlier said "hazardous tsunami waves are forecast for some coasts" but later said the threat had passed.</p>

<p>"There is no longer a tsunami threat from this earthquake," it said.</p>

<p>Peru, with some 33 million inhabitants, lies on the so-called Pacific Ring of Fire, a vast area of intense seismic activity that runs along the west coast of the Americas.</p>

<p>Peru is hit by hundreds of detectable quakes every year.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The co-founder of OceanGate, which conducted a fatal excursion to the Titanic last year, is set to embark on a new journey. Guillermo Sohnlein plans to study a "virtually unexplored" sinkhole in the Bahamas, which is dubbed as "portal to hell" by the locals. According to <em>New York Post</em>, Mr Sohnlein plans to descend in a submersible into the Dean's Blue Hole, one of the world's deepest ocean sinkholes. He will be joined by scientist Kenny Broad and chief medical officer and former NASA astronaut Scott Parazynski, <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/06/25/us-news/oceangate-co-founder-to-lead-dive-into-deans-blue-hole-in-bahamas/">the outlet further said</a>.</p>

<p>"Dean's Blue Hole remains virtually unexplored, offering an opportunity to discover the hidden secrets of cave-dwelling species, geological climate history and unique ecosystems," according to a page on <a href="https://bluemarbleexploration.com/abyss/">the company's website</a>.</p>

<p>Dean's Blue Hole is a 664-foot underwater cavern surrounded by a beach on a remote Bahaman island, according to Blue Marble. It formed some 15,000 years ago and, due to its extreme depth, very little is known about it.</p>

<p>The sinkhole is shaped like a vase with a narrow opening near the surface that leads to much wider water body below.</p>

<p>Scientists believe the chamber below is connected to the Atlantic Ocean, something that the company says will offer a "certain amount of unpredictability".</p>

<p>One of the biggest challenges will be to manage the pressure on the ocean floor, which will be considerably high as compared to the surface.</p>

<p>"We fully expect to find human remains and prepare to handle those situations with proper respect for the families," the <em>Post</em> quoted the company as saying. However, the date when the expedition will start has not been announced.</p>

<p>Mr Sohnlein founded OceanGate in 2009 with Stockton Rush - who was one of the five killed when the Titan submersible imploded last June - but left and started another deep-sea exploration company, Blue Marble Exploration.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>South Korea's military on Friday released a video that it said showed a North Korean missile abnormally spiralling early in flight and exploding, a rare publicising of surveillance footage to dismiss the North's claim of a successful test.</p>

<p>Footage filmed by a thermal observation device with South Korean frontline units showed a projectile spiralling out of control on an irregular flight path, then disintegrating.</p>

<p>The South Korean military assessed that "instability during flight" led to the missile's explosion, it said in a statement on Friday, calling North Korea's claims of success as "deception and exaggeration to cover up the failure".</p>

<p>North Korean state media had said that Pyongyang successfully conducted an important test on Wednesday aimed at developing missiles able to deploy multiple warheads, a claim rejected by South Korea.</p>

<p>North Korea's missile administration used the first-stage engine of a solid-fuel intermediate-range ballistic missile to test the separation and guidance of multiple warheads, according to the North's official KCNA news agency.</p>

<p>South Korea's military said it had detected signs of missile launch preparations early on Wednesday and was watching as the rocket was launched.</p>

<p>In April, Pyongyang said it had tested a new solid-fuel hypersonic missile with intermediate range, part of an intensifying race for the next generation of long-range rockets hard to track and intercept.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

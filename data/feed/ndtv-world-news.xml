       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>South Korea on Thursday announced that it is ready to start mass-producing laser weapons like those in the<em> 'Star Wars' </em>franchise to shoot down North Korean drones. According to <em>Newsweek</em>, the drone-killing system, called the Block-I, will be deployed later this year. With this, South Korea will become the world's first country to deploy a technology that is being developed by several armed forces. Moreover, the country's Defense Acquisition Program Administration (DAPA) announced that an even more powerful version is also being planned, which could be a "game changer" in the future.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.newsweek.com/south-korea-develops-laser-drone-defense-1923766"><em>Newsweek</em></a>, South Korea has named its laser program the "StarWars Project". The country's DAPA, which handles defence procurement, development and production, announced a 100 billion won contract to build the drone-killing weapon. It touted the weapon as effective and cheap and revealed that the laser is quiet and invisible, and one shot costs only 2,000 won.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Our country is becoming the first country in the world to deploy and operate laser weapons, and our military's response capabilities on North Korea's drone provocation will be further strengthened," the agency said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.thetimes.com/world/asia/article/south-koreas-star-wars-laser-to-bring-down-drones-at-110-a-shot-fscqswpks"><em>Times </em></a>reported that Block-I uses fibre optic cables to generate a laser beam intended to be fired at relatively close range against small drones. Each shot is silent and invisible to the naked eye. It lasts 10 to 20 seconds and creates a temperature of more than 700 Celsius, which is enough to damage and disable a drone's engine or battery. It can be fired wherever there is a sufficient supply of electricity.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Cost per fire is extremely cheap compared with other guided weapons," Jo Yong-jin, a spokesman for the DAPA, told reporters in Seoul. "Responses to low-cost strike assets and weapons, such as small drones, will be able to take place very effectively and efficiently," he added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>South Korean aerospace company Hanwha Aerospace Co. is contracted to manufacture the weapons. <em>Newsweek </em>reported that DAPA is already planning to develop a more powerful, longer-ranged anti-aircraft laser weapon: the Block-II. This weapon will involve boosting the power of the laser beam to hundreds of kilowatts, with the aim of taking down larger targets like ballistic missiles and planes.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, several countries, including the US, UK, Israel, Turkey, Germany and Japan have also developed laser weapons. Earlier this year, the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/video-shows-uks-first-laser-weapon-that-can-hit-a-coin-from-a-kilometre-away-5223169">UK's Ministry of Defence</a> tested a laser weapon, DragonFire, which reportedly destroyed incoming drones from several miles away during a trial. With this, the ministry hopes that it will pave the way for a low-cost alternative to missiles to shoot down targets like drones. It further said that the weapon is precise enough to hit a coin from a kilometre away.&nbsp;</p>

<p>DragonFire will be used both by the Army and the Royal Navy as part of their future air defence capabilities.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At least five dozen people are suspected to be missing after a landslide along the Madan-Ashrit Highway in Central Nepal swept two passenger buses in early Friday morning.</p>

<p>As per the officials on the site of the incident, the bus is assumed to have been swept down to the Trishuli River which has swollen hampering the search and rescue operation.</p>

<p>"As per the preliminary information both the buses were carrying a total of 63 people, including the bus drivers. The landslide swept the buses at around 3:30 AM. We are at the incident site and a search operation is underway. Incessant rain is hampering our efforts to search for the missing buses," Indradev Yadav, Chief District Officer, Chitwan confirmed ANI over the phone.</p>

<p>As per the official, the landslide swept the Kathmandu-bound Angel bus and Ganpati Deluxe, which was heading from Kathmandu to Rautahat's Gaur. As per the preliminary reports of the officials, there were 24 people onboard the bus that was heading to Kathmandu and 41 people were travelling in another bus.</p>

<p>Taking to X, Nepal PM Pushpa Kamal Dahal stated, "I am deeply saddened by the reports of about five dozen passengers that are missing when bus was washed away by a landslide on the Narayangadh- Muglin road section and the loss of properties due to floods and landslides in different parts of the country. I direct all agencies of the government, including the home administration, to search and effectively rescue the passengers."</p>

<p>All the flights from Kathmandu to Chitwan's Bharatpur has been cancelled for the day as the weather remains grim.</p>

<p>Three of the passengers on the Ganpati Deluxe managed to escape after jumping out of the vehicle. Nepal Police and Armed Police Force personnel are heading towards the incident sites for rescue operations, Superintendent of Police Bhawesh Rimal informed. Debris from landslides at various places has obstructed traffic on the Narayanghat-Mugling road section.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Live rounds were found in the cartridge belts of Alec Baldwin and another actor on the set of a Western movie that was the scene of a fatal shooting, a police technician testified Thursday at the trial of the Hollywood star.</p>

<p>Baldwin, 66, is charged with involuntary manslaughter in connection with the October 2021 death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins during filming of the movie "Rust."</p>

<p>The actor -- known for the television comedy "30 Rock" -- was holding a prop revolver during a rehearsal in a church when it fired a live round, killing Hutchins and wounding the movie's director.</p>

<p>Marissa Poppell, a crime scene technician, testified that a number of live rounds were mixed in with dummy rounds on the set of the movie being filmed in New Mexico, where the trial is taking place.</p>

<p>Poppell, under questioning from Baldwin's attorney, Alex Spiro, on the second day of the trial said a live round was found in Baldwin's bandolier.</p>

<p>"You had no reason to think that Mr Baldwin had any idea that was there?" Spiro asked.</p>

<p>"Correct," Poppell replied.</p>

<p>She said another actor on the set, Jensen Ackles, also had a live bullet in his bandolier and also had no reason to believe that he knew it was there either.</p>

<p>The jury was also shown photographs of ammunition boxes on a prop cart with live rounds mixed in with dummy bullets. The bullets are largely indistinguishable.</p>

<p>During opening arguments on Wednesday, prosecutor Erlinda Ocampo Johnson accused Baldwin of violating basic gun safety rules and playing "make-believe" with a deadly weapon.</p>

<p>Baldwin had behaved in "a reckless manner" and "without due regard for the safety of others" on set, Johnson said, allegedly failing to take weapons training seriously and regularly pointing firearms at people on set.</p>

<p>Baldwin faces up to 18 months in prison if found guilty.</p>

<p>Spiro, whose other clients include Elon Musk and Jay-Z, said Baldwin had no reason to believe the gun might be loaded and was not responsible as an actor for checking the weapon's contents.</p>

<h3><strong>&nbsp;Armorer convicted&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Hutchins, the victim, was originally from Ukraine, and her career as a Hollywood cinematographer was thriving when she was killed at the age of 42.</p>

<p>The tragedy occurred during a rehearsal in a small chapel on the Bonanza Creek Ranch, a historic location for Western movies, midway through the filming of "Rust."</p>

<p>Baldwin was practising a scene in which his outlaw character, trapped by two marshals, brandishes his Colt six-shooter.</p>

<p>In his opening arguments, Spiro focused blame on the movie's safety officials, including armourer Hannah Gutierrez, for allowing live rounds to be brought on set.</p>

<p>Gutierrez was convicted by the same court this year and is serving an 18-month sentence.</p>

<p>It is not known if Baldwin will take the stand in his defense. Legal experts say it would be a risky move, exposing the allegedly temperamental actor to hostile cross-examination.</p>

<p>The trial is scheduled to conclude on Friday of next week, with jury deliberations to follow.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>All was going according to plan. President Joe Biden was projecting himself as the leader of the free world as he hosted a NATO summit and then, in a moment, an embarrassing slip of the tongue.</p>

<p>With Biden struggling to convince many Americans that he remains fit for office, NATO leaders have been offering him votes of confidence, however delicately, at least in part out of fear of another <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/great-job-joe-donald-trump-mocks-joe-biden-gaffes-in-middle-of-nato-press-meet-6087136#pfrom=home-ndtv_topstories">Donald Trump</a> presidency.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Biden was closing out NATO's three-day 75th-anniversary summit in Washington, vowing forcefully, "Ukraine will prevail" against Russian President Vladimir Putin and hailing the courage of Ukraine's iconic wartime leader, Voldymyr Zelensky.</p>

<p>Turning to Zelensky in his war fatigues, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/biden-introduces-zelensky-as-putin-at-nato-press-meet-corrects-himself-6086831">Joe Biden</a> said, "Ladies and gentlemen, President Putin."</p>

<p>Biden quickly corrected himself and Zelensky, a former comedian, promptly made light of the gaffe, saying, "I am better than Putin."</p>

<p>But the momentary lapse quickly revived memories of his debate two weeks earlier against Trump -- he had failed in his own task, to reassure the public he still had his wits.</p>

<h3><strong>Biden 'in charge'</strong></h3>

<p>Whether motivated by direct observation, fear of the return of Donald Trump or a simple reluctance to offend their host, no leaders openly questioned the competence of Biden, who at 81 is six years older than the alliance itself.</p>

<p>French President Emmanuel Macron said he spoke to Biden at length at a White House dinner for leaders.</p>

<p>"I saw as always a president who is in charge, clear on the issues he knows well," Macron said.</p>

<p>German Chancellor Olaf Scholz similarly said that Biden "showed leadership for our common alliance."</p>

<p>"Slips of the tongue happen, and if you keep a close enough eye on everyone, you will find enough," Scholz said.</p>

<p>New UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said that senility allegations against Biden were misguided and that the two allies covered wide ground for nearly one hour in the Oval Office, longer than expected.</p>

<p>"We did it at pace. He was on good form," Starmer, whose Labour Party last week swept out the Conservatives and has no love lost with Trump, told British media before the summit gaffe.</p>

<p>Polish President Andrzej Duda, who had forged close ties with Trump but has appreciated Biden's support for Ukraine, told reporters: "I talked with President Biden, and there is no doubt that everything is ok."</p>

<p>Finnish President Alexander Stubb, asked if he had concerns about the United States, said that in democracies there is "always turmoil before elections."</p>

<p>"I have absolutely no concern about the capacity of the current president of the United States to lead his country and to lead our fight for Ukraine and to lead NATO," he said.</p>

<p>"The only thing I'm worried about is that the political climate in the United States right now is too toxic, is very polarized, and that doesn't leave enough room for a civilized and constructive debate" on policy, he told reporters.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Many NATO leaders privately fear a victory in November of Trump, who has loudly criticized the alliance, with its promise of collective defense, as an unfair burden to the United States.</p>

<p>Trump aides have mused about conditioning aid to Ukraine to force Kyiv to surrender territory and make a quick deal to end the war, which they call a distraction from a larger challenge of China.</p>

<p>Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, while saying she would not comment on the US election, stressed that the United States and Europe would remain united no matter who wins the election.</p>

<p>"You saved us once," she said of the United States. "Please stick to that way of working."</p>

<p>One discordant voice in NATO has been Hungary's populist prime minister Viktor Orban.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He traveled to Russia and China, as well as Ukraine, before the NATO summit and, after it is over, was heading to Florida to see Trump.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden defiantly insisted Thursday that he will run for another term and win, as a series of verbal gaffes while leading a major summit threw a harsh new spotlight on his fitness.</p>

<p>The 81-year-old president sought to show himself in command as he led the NATO summit in Washington two weeks after a disastrous debate performance raised fears among Democrats that he may lose to Donald Trump.</p>

<p>But Biden mistakenly introduced Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky as his Russian foe Vladimir Putin before quickly correcting himself.</p>

<p>At a high-stakes evening news conference afterward, Biden mistakenly referred to "Vice President" Trump.</p>

<p>But he vowed to stay in the race.</p>

<p>"I think I'm the most qualified person to run for president. I beat him once, and I will beat him again," Biden said of Trump.</p>

<p>Biden, already the oldest person to be elected the first time to the White House, said he was "not in this for my legacy" but to "complete the job I started."</p>

<p>Biden has faced a steady drumbeat of Democrats calling for him to abandon his 2024 candidacy, fearing that Trump is in a position to beat him.</p>

<p>Biden made clear he supported Harris -- who as vice president would take over from him, but is also seen by a growing number of Democrats as a stronger candidate at the top of the ticket.</p>

<p>Biden said he would not have picked Kamala Harris, whom he accidentally referred to as Trump, if "she was not qualified to be president."</p>

<p>He also denied reports that he needed to go to bed by 8 pm, a time at which he was still holding his news conference on Thursday.</p>

<p>"Instead of my every day starting at 7:00 am and going to bed at midnight, it would be smarter for me to pace myself a little more," Biden said.</p>

<h2>'Slips of the tongue happen'</h2>

<p>Biden's error on Zelensky's name drew gasps from the room but Zelensky, Ukraine's wartime leader against Russia's 2022 invasion, laughed it off.</p>

<p>Fellow leaders at the summit have fielded questions about Biden, and their answers have largely been supportive.</p>

<p>"Slips of the tongue happen, and if you keep a close enough eye on everyone, you will find enough," German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said after the president's latest gaffe.</p>

<p>French President Emmanuel Macron said Biden had appeared "in charge," while British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said he "was on good form."</p>

<p>But key American supporters have moved away from the diplomatic niceties.</p>

<p>Hollywood actor and well-connected Democratic supporter George Clooney called on Biden to exit the race, and party grandee Nancy Pelosi has stopped short of fully backing him.</p>

<p>Around 14 Democratic members of the House of Representatives have openly urged the man who beat Trump four years ago to drop out, along with one Democratic senator.</p>

<p>A poll released on Thursday showed more than half of Democrats say Biden should end his bid for a second term, and two-thirds of Americans believe he should quit the race.</p>

<p>But the former president and the incumbent remain in a dead heat on 46 percent, according to the Washington Post-ABC News-Ipsos survey.</p>

<p>Biden's campaign was however quietly testing the strength of Harris in a potential match-up against Trump, The New York Times reported.</p>

<p>Some of the president's longtime aides are meanwhile discussing how to convince him that he should step aside, the paper also said, citing anonymous sources.</p>

<p>The White House said the report was "unequivocally" false.</p>

<p>The once-talkative Biden has given fewer news conferences than his predecessors, but he was speaking at unusual length Thursday in what his aides called a "big boy" press event.</p>

<p>Biden has called his debate meltdown a "bad night," blaming it on a cold and jet lag.</p>

<p>But Clooney tried to torpedo the narrative that it was a one-off, saying it was "devastating" to admit but the signs were also clear at a June 15 fundraiser in Los Angeles he hosted.</p>

<p>Biden's campaign fought back Thursday with a new ad campaign on the last day of the NATO summit portraying Trump as a "lap dog" of Putin.</p>

<p>NATO allies have also been seeking reassurance about Biden's leadership abilities and over their fears that a return of the isolationist, Putin-praising Trump could spell trouble for the alliance.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kyiv said Thursday that it had seized a foreign cargo ship and detained its captain, alleging that the vessel had illegally exported Ukrainian grain from the annexed Crimean peninsula.</p>

<p>Since Russia's capture of swaths of agricultural land in Ukraine in early 2022, Kyiv has accused Moscow of illegally harvesting and shipping grain produced on occupied territory to third countries.</p>

<p>The office of the prosecutor general in Ukraine said it had seized the vessel in the southern Odesa region, and that the ship had earlier exported agricultural products via Sevastopol -- a key Russian Black Sea naval hub in Crimea.</p>

<p>The waterway has become a fierce battleground of the war, and Ukraine has beaten back a formidable Russian naval blockade of its ports with a fleet of relatively cheap maritime drones.</p>

<p>The Security Services of Ukraine (SBU) said in a separate statement that it had detained the ship's captain, accusing him of violating rules on entering occupied territory.</p>

<p>It also claimed that the grain exported by the vessel -- Usko Mfu -- had been "looted" from southern Ukraine.</p>

<p>The charges against the captain carry a maximum penalty of five years in prison, the SBU said, while prosecutors identified him as a citizen of Azerbaijan, an ex-Soviet country in the South Caucasus.</p>

<h3><strong>Shipments to Turkey&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Prosecutors said 12 other foreign crew members were on board at the time of the vessel's seizure, without elaborating on their nationality or whether they too would face charges.</p>

<p>The Cameroonian-flagged vessel illegally docked at Sevastopol in November 2023 and loaded more than 3,000 tonnes of agricultural products "intended" for a Turkish company, prosecutors said.</p>

<p>"To conceal the illegal activity, the ship's Automatic Identification System (AIS) was turned off before entering the port of Sevastopol, which is a gross violation of maritime safety requirements," their statement added.</p>

<p>Prosecutors said the ship returned to Sevastopol a second time in May this year.</p>

<p>It was seized at the Ukrainian port of Reni, they added, where they discovered documents issued by Sevastopol port authorities.</p>

<p>The port on the Danube in west Ukraine was one of several systematically targeted by Russian aerial attacks after Moscow last year scrapped a UN and Turkish-brokered deal allowing Ukrainian grain exports via the Black Sea.</p>

<p>Igor Delanoe -- deputy director of the Franco-Russian Observatory -- said this was the first time Ukraine had seized an internationally-flagged vessel over the shipments.</p>

<h3><strong>'Sends a signal'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>"The signal is that they want to make third countries face up to their responsibilities," he told AFP.</p>

<p>"From the Ukrainian point of view, these countries are supporting Russia by their silence, while at the same time benefiting from grain that Ukrainians consider stolen," he added.</p>

<p>Prosecutors said later on state television they had issued 21 warrants to seize cargo ships in absentia they believe have docked at Ukrainian ports under Russian occupation.</p>

<p>Igor Ponochovny, a Ukrainian official in the prosecutor's office working on issues related to the Crimean peninsula, which was annexed by Russian forces in 2014, said the seizure was a "signal to countries that help Russia to circumvent sanctions."</p>

<p>The European Union in May imposed "prohibitive" duties on grain imports from Russia in a bid to cut off revenues to Moscow for its war on Ukraine.</p>

<p>The bloc's trade commissioner said the measure would "tackle illegal Russian exports of stolen Ukraine grain into EU markets".</p>

<p>The head of Ukraine's southern Kherson region, which the Kremlin claims is part of Russia, said Thursday that Russian forces caused fires on dozens of hectares of Ukrainian land growing grain.</p>

<p>He also said that Russian forces had struck a grain storage facility in the region and attacked firefighters who arrived to extinguish the fire with drones.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Amid the mounting pressure from fellow Democrats to end his re-election campaign, US President Joe Biden has indicated willingness to undergo a neurological exam to address concerns about his mental fitness for office, but only if his doctors recommend it, CNN reported.</p>

<p>"I am not opposed, if my doctors tell me I should have another neurological exam, I'll do it," he said at a rare solo news conference Thursday at the conclusion of the NATO Summit.</p>

<p>He further added, "Every single day I'm surrounded by good docs. If they think there's a problem, I promise you - or even if they don't think it's a problem and think I should have a neurologic exam again, I'll do it. No one's suggesting that right now," as per CNN.</p>

<p>But, the president lamented growing concerns about his age, "No matter what I did, no one's gonna be satisfied."</p>

<p>Biden said he has had three brain health checks while in office, with the most recent one happening in February."</p>

<p>"I'm tested every single day on my neurological capacity - the decisions I make every day," he said, pointing to age as a source of wisdom.</p>

<p>Further, Biden told reporters Thursday he's committed to remaining in the race ahead, but acknowledged he has to make his case to detractors and American voters concerned over his fitness for office following a disastrous debate performance.</p>

<p>"I'm determined on running, but I think it's important that I allay fears by seeing -- letting them see me out there," Biden said.</p>

<p>He cited his robust travel schedule in the days since the debate, pointing to "over 20 major events, from Wisconsin and North Carolina," emphasizing he's "going out to the areas where we can persuade people to move our way or people are already there."</p>

<p>"I'm going to be going around making the case of the things that I think we have to finish and how we can't afford to lose what we've done," he said, citing efforts under his administration.</p>

<p>After the CNN debate with former US President Donald Trump on June 28, the leaders have been pushing Biden to step down from the presidential race despite this he has declared that he is staying and expressed confidence that he would defeat former President Trump.</p>

<p>On July 8, a leadership call was organised by House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, where several top House Democrats urged President Joe Biden to step aside from the 2024 campaign, expressing deep concerns about his potential impact on the Democratic Party's chances in the upcoming elections.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Shortly after President Joe Biden's halting debate with Donald Trump on June 27, his exit from the 2024 U.S. presidential race seemed all but inevitable to some longtime allies.</p>

<p>Donors called it a disaster and held frantic calls to discuss next steps. Newspaper columnists demanded he bow out. Some Democratic lawmakers said plainly their party leader must step aside.</p>

<p>Two weeks later, Biden hasn't budged.</p>

<p>While acknowledging that at 81, he is no longer a young man and blaming exhaustion for his performance, he failed in a defiant follow-up televised interview to quell concerns it was more than just one bad debate night.</p>

<p>More Democrats are expected to ask Biden to leave the race in coming days. For now, the White House says it plans to "turn the page" on the incident, despite some opinion polls showing Trump's lead widening and swing states leaning Republican.</p>

<p>Why is Biden ignoring fellow Democrats and insisting he will beat Trump, 78, in the Nov. 5 election?</p>

<p>The reasons range from the deeply personal to party politics, interviews with more Democratic officials, aides, strategists and donors show.</p>

<p><strong>BIDEN BELIEVES IN BIDEN</strong></p>

<p>Biden's decision to run for reelection in the first place, despite his age, centered around his belief that he was the best Democratic candidate to defeat Trump, officials and allies told Reuters at the time.</p>

<p>Biden was skeptical about the ability of his vice president, Kamala Harris, to win over middle-of-the road voters, especially in critical swing states, and also of the ability of any of the deep bench of Democratic governors and lawmakers who are likely to be the party's future leaders, these sources said.</p>

<p>Explaining his decision to stay the course, Biden told George Stephanopoulos of ABC News last week: "I'm the most qualified person to beat him (Trump)." He later added that only the "Lord almighty" could convince him differently.</p>

<p>A defining principle of Biden's grief-stricken personal life and long political career has been perseverance, which he says he learned from his parents.</p>

<p>"My dad, who fell on hard times, always told me, though, 'Champ, when you get knocked down, get up. Get up," he told the 2008 Democratic National Convention when he accepted the nomination as Barack Obama's running mate.</p>

<p>He said his mother taught him: "Failure at some point in your life is inevitable, but giving up is unforgivable."</p>

<p>Actor George Clooney echoed the concerns of many Democrats about this principle, writing in a New York Times opinion piece on Wednesday that it was time for Biden to leave the race. Clooney said that "the one battle he cannot win is the fight against time. None of us can."</p>

<p><strong>BIDEN'S CLOSEST AIDES ARE DUG IN</strong></p>

<p>Biden's inner circle of top aides has reinforced his determination to hold on, according to sources close to them.</p>

<p>Biden has surrounded himself for decades with a small cadre of senior aides, such as political adviser Mike Donilon, counselor Steve Ricchetti, and deputy chief of staff Bruce Reed, who have steered him through previous crises and urged him to hang on.</p>

<p>That dynamic has only been amplified since the fallout from the debate.</p>

<p>"I have heard that Steve and Bruce and Mike are more dug in than he is," said one former Biden aide with ties to the White House. "They have grown roots and are not moving."</p>

<p>A White House official confirmed that characterization and said the dug-in approach applied to Biden's full senior staff.</p>

<p>Many of his aides, including senior adviser Anita Dunn, reinforce a sense of grievance and resolve around Biden: that he has been treated unfairly by the media, that he does not get the credit he deserves for toppling Trump in 2020, and that he has been underestimated before and proven his critics wrong.</p>

<p>Many people in Biden's orbit feel that way, the White House official said.</p>

<p>A memo circulated on Thursday by Jen O'Malley Dillon and Julie Chavez Rodriguez, Biden's campaign chair and manager, respectively, said there was no better alternative to Biden.</p>

<p>"Surveys do not take into account the negative media environment that any Democratic nominee will encounter. The only Democratic candidate for whom this is already baked in is President Biden," they wrote.</p>

<p><strong>SOME DEMOCRATS FEAR CHANCES WITH HARRIS</strong></p>

<p>Biden's ability to beat back Democratic calls for him to exit the race may have less to do with his own candidacy than the lackluster feeling some Democrats have about the potential alternatives to replace him.</p>

<p>In interviews, about a dozen Democrats, including elected officials and activists, many of them in the battleground state of Pennsylvania, all expressed deep concerns about Biden's mental fitness and ability to beat Trump.</p>

<p>But they also had little trust in a bench of Democrats led by Harris.</p>

<p>If Biden were to step down, they believe the party could not bypass Harris – the nation's first Black vice president and first woman vice president – without risking the diverse coalition needed to win the White House.</p>

<p>"It has to be Harris and I don't think that puts us in a better position to win than with a hobbled Joe Biden," said one senior Democrat in Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>On the other hand, some Democrats say Harris could bring new enthusiasm to the party and reenergize youth and Black voters.</p>

<p><strong>CONGRESS FEARS AND TRADITIONS</strong></p>

<p>Soon after Biden's debate, the leaders of both the Congressional Black Caucus and the Congressional Hispanic Caucus issued statements of support for Biden, which appeared to slow the trickle of criticism.</p>

<p>With their endorsement, rank-and-file Democrats were hard-pressed this week to publicly abandon Biden.</p>

<p>As of Thursday, only 11 of the 213 Democrats in the House of Representatives and one of the Senate's 51 Democrats had appealed to the president to withdraw from the race.</p>

<p>But multiple House members said they believed there was more to come, noting that they were expecting Democratic Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries to pass on the criticisms from within the party to Biden.</p>

<p>"I wish more people were less scared," said Democratic Representative Seth Moulton, one of the House members who have called for Biden to end his campaign.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden was "in charge" and on top of matters at a NATO summit with fellow leaders in Washington, French President Emmanuel Macron said Thursday.</p>

<p>"I was able to talk with President Biden at length yesterday at dinner," Macron told reporters. "I saw as always a president who is in charge, clear on the issues he knows well."</p>

<p>The French leader was also asked about a gaffe made by Biden just minutes earlier when he mistakenly introduced Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky as his Russian foe Vladimir Putin, before quickly correcting himself.</p>

<p>The blunder intensified concerns about Biden's age and mental acuity after a disastrous debate performance against Donald Trump two weeks ago.</p>

<p>"We all slip up sometimes," Macron said. "It's happened to me and it could happen again tomorrow. I would ask for your indulgence."</p>

<p>Macron also said that France will continue to support Ukraine "as long as necessary."</p>

<p>Asked about recent visits to Russia and China by Viktor Orban, Macron said the Hungarian prime minister did not go there with any "mandate" from the EU.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As President Joe Biden faces mounting pressure over the future of his candidacy, his campaign is quietly testing Vice President Kamala Harris's viability against former President Donald Trump through a voter survey, New York Times reported</p>

<p>This evaluation, shared anonymously due to its sensitive nature, occurs amid increasing pressure on Biden to reconsider his re-election bid.</p>

<p>Some of Biden's long-standing advisers are reportedly considering ways to convince him to withdraw from the race, as per New York Times.</p>

<p>Many Democrats were left deeply troubled by Biden's disastrous debate performance two weeks ago, and he has faced increasing calls from lawmakers and fund-raisers to step aside.</p>

<p>Earlier in the day, Democratic leaders challenged Joe Biden to provide convincing evidence of a viable path to reelection after his debate performance, bad battleground state polling and growing concerns that he cannot defeat former Donald Trump in the presidential elections</p>

<p>After the CNN debate with former US President Donald Trump on June 28, the leaders have been pushing Biden to step down from the presidential race despite this he has declared that he is staying and expressed confidence that he would defeat former Trump.</p>

<p>Recently, Biden told congressional Democrats in a letter on July 9 that he would continue his election bid despite mounting concerns about his mental fitness.</p>

<p>Further, he also stated that he will be "running this race to end" of the November election, despite private calls from Democrats to drop out. In the letter, Biden called for unity among his party, emphasising the need for a collective effort to defeat former President Donald Trump in the upcoming election.</p>

<p>"Any weakening of resolve or lack of clarity about the task ahead only helps Trump and hurts us. It's time to come together, move forward as a unified party, and defeat Donald Trump," said Biden</p>

<p>On July 8, a leadership call was organised by House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, where several top House Democrats urged President Joe Biden to step aside from the 2024 campaign, expressing deep concerns about his potential impact on the Democratic Party's chances in the upcoming elections.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden mistakenly introduced Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky as his Russian foe Vladimir Putin at a NATO summit Thursday in a blunder just hours before a press conference that could decide the fate of his reelection bid.</p>

<p>The 81-year-old quickly corrected himself, and Zelensky quipped that he was "better" than Putin, but the gaffe intensified concerns about Biden's mental acuity after a disastrous debate performance against Donald Trump two weeks ago.</p>

<p>"And now I want to hand it over to the president of Ukraine, who has as much courage as he has determination, ladies and gentlemen, President Putin," Biden said as he announced a NATO-Ukraine compact at the summit in Washington.</p>

<p>Biden turned away from the lectern before coming back and exclaiming: "President Putin! He's going to beat President Putin. President Zelensky -- I'm so focused on beating Putin we gotta worry about it. Anyway, Mr President."</p>

<p>The error drew gasps from the room but Zelensky, Ukraine's wartime leader against Russia's 2022 invasion, laughed it off.</p>

<p>Fellow leaders at the summit have fielded questions about Biden, and their answers have largely been supportive.</p>

<p>"Slips of the tongue happen, and if you keep a close enough eye on everyone, you will find enough," German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said after the president's latest gaffe.</p>

<p>French President Emmanuel Macron said Biden had appeared "in charge," while British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said he "was on good form."</p>

<p>But his latest verbal slip could not have come at a worse time as Biden is due&nbsp; later Thursday to give what the White House has called a "big boy" press conference, his first major appearance since the debate.</p>

<p>The solo appearance, a rare unscripted encounter with reporters, comes amid growing calls in his Democratic Party for him to step aside.</p>

<p>The press conference was due to start at 6:30 pm (2230 GMT) but is expected to run around an hour late.</p>

<p>- Growing pressure -</p>

<p>There has been a steady drumbeat of Democrats calling for Biden to abandon his 2024 candidacy.</p>

<p>Hollywood actor and well-connected Democratic supporter George Clooney called on Biden to exit the race, and party grandee Nancy Pelosi has stopped short of fully backing him.</p>

<p>Around 14 Democratic members of the House of Representatives have openly urged the man who beat Trump four years ago to drop out, along with one Democratic senator.</p>

<p>A poll released on Thursday showed more than half of Democrats say Biden should end his bid for a second term, and two-thirds of Americans believe he should quit the race.</p>

<p>But the former president and the incumbent remain in a dead heat on 46 percent, according to the Washington Post-ABC News-Ipsos survey.</p>

<p>Biden's campaign was however quietly testing the strength of Vice President Kamala Harris in a potential match-up against Trump, The New York Times reported.</p>

<p>Some of the president's longtime aides are meanwhile discussing how to persuade him that he should step aside, the paper also said, citing anonymous sources.</p>

<p>The White House said the report was "unequivocally" false.</p>

<p>The once-talkative Biden has given fewer news conferences than his predecessors, and recent ones have only been with foreign leaders, restricted to two questions each.</p>

<p>Coupled with a lack of interviews, it has led critics to accuse the White House of shielding the effects of age on America's oldest president.</p>

<p>Biden has called his debate meltdown a "bad night," blaming it on a cold and jet lag.</p>

<p>But Clooney tried to torpedo the narrative that it was a one-off, saying it was "devastating" to admit but the signs were also clear at a June 15 fundraiser in Los Angeles he hosted.</p>

<p>Biden has insisted he is committed to running in November, and with the Democratic party primary votes under his belt there is no real way of forcing him out.</p>

<p>His campaign fought back Thursday with a new ad campaign on the last day of the NATO summit portraying Trump as a "lap dog" of Putin.</p>

<p>NATO allies have also been seeking reassurance about Biden's leadership abilities and over their fears that a return of the isolationist, Putin-praising Trump could spell trouble for the alliance.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Covid-19 is still killing around 1,700 people a week around the world, the World Health Organization said Thursday, as it urged at-risk populations to keep up with their vaccinations against the disease.</p>

<p>WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus sounded a warning on declining vaccine coverage.</p>

<p>Despite the continued death count, "data show that vaccine coverage has declined among health workers and people over 60, which are two of the most at-risk groups," the UN health agency's chief told a press conference.</p>

<p>"WHO recommends that people in the highest-risk groups receive a Covid-19 vaccine within 12 months of their last dose."</p>

<p>More than seven million Covid deaths have been reported to the WHO, though the true count of the pandemic is thought to be far higher.</p>

<p>Covid-19 also shredded economies and crippled health systems.</p>

<p>Tedros declared an end to Covid-19 as an international public health emergency in May 2023, more than three years on from when the virus was first detected in Wuhan, China, in late 2019.</p>

<p>The WHO has urged governments to maintain virus surveillance and sequencing, and to ensure access to affordable and reliable tests, treatments and vaccines.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United States' plan to periodically station long-range missiles in Germany will lead to Cold War-style confrontation between Russia and the West, the Kremlin said Thursday.</p>

<p>The White House announced the decision on Wednesday during a NATO summit in Washington, arguing the stationing of long-range weapons including Tomahawk cruise missiles in Europe acts as a deterrent.</p>

<p>"We are taking steady steps towards the Cold War," Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told a state TV reporter.</p>

<p>"All the attributes of the Cold War with the direct confrontation are returning," he said.</p>

<p>He added Washington's decision gave Russia "a reason to pull together" and "fulfil all the goals" of its military campaign in Ukraine.</p>

<p>NATO countries spearheaded by the United States have bolstered their defences in Europe in the wake of Russia's 2022 offensive against neighbouring Ukraine.</p>

<p>German Chancellor Olaf Scholz hailed the planned deployment of the US weapons in his country, calling the move a "necessary and important decision at the right time".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President Volodymyr Zelensky said Thursday he was confident Ukraine would eventually join NATO after the alliance said the Russian-invaded country had an "irreversible" path to membership.</p>

<p>"We have strong wording regarding the irreversibility of Ukraine's movement towards NATO. Every step truly brings us closer to membership," Zelensky told a news conference at a NATO summit alongside the alliance's chief Jens Stoltenberg.</p>

<p>"We are doing and will continue to do everything to ensure that the day comes when Ukraine is invited and becomes a NATO member, and I am confident we will achieve this," he said.</p>

<p>Zelensky's reaction was significantly warmer than a year ago at the NATO summit in Lithuania where he was visibly upset that there was not a firmer promise on membership.</p>

<p>NATO, formed in the Cold War, is a collective defense pact in which an attack on one ally is an attack on all.</p>

<p>The United States and Germany have led concerns about quickly bringing Ukraine into NATO, believing it would effectively put them at war with nuclear-armed Russia.</p>

<p>A declaration issued Wednesday at the 75th anniversary NATO summit in Washington said leaders supported Ukraine on "its irreversible path to full Euro-Atlantic integration, including NATO membership."</p>

<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has cited Ukraine's NATO aspirations as a reason to attack the former Soviet republic, rejecting the idea that the country has a separate historical identity.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russia on Thursday added opposition figure Yulia Navalnaya to its list of "terrorists" and "extremists," two days after it issued an arrest warrant for the exiled dissident.</p>

<p>Navalnaya has vowed to continue the work of her husband Alexei Navalny, Russian leader Vladimir Putin's main opponent who died in an Arctic prison in unclear circumstances in February.</p>

<p>Her personal details appeared Thursday in an online blacklist maintained by Rosfinmonitoring, a state agency designed to combat the financing of people and organisations Moscow deems "terrorists" or involved in "extremist activity".</p>

<p>Russian officials frequently apply such labels to opposition figures and those who campaign against the Kremlin or its offensive on Ukraine.</p>

<p>Navalny's organisations were outlawed in Russia and are labelled "extremist".</p>

<p>The opposition leader himself was sentenced to 19 years in prison on charges of "extremism."</p>

<p>A court in the capital Moscow on Tuesday ordered Navalnaya arrested in absentia, also on charges of "extremism."</p>

<p>Following her husband's death, Navalnaya, 47, vowed to take up his work and has lobbied against Putin's government from abroad.</p>

<p>"If they're making such a fuss, then Yulia is doing everything right," Kira Yarmysh, Navalnaya's press secretary said on social media after she was added to the blacklist.</p>

<p>Navalnaya, an economist, stood by her husband as he galvanised mass protests in Russia, flying him out of the country when he was poisoned before defiantly returning to Moscow with him in 2021, knowing he would be jailed.</p>

<p>Like much of Russia's opposition, Navalnaya lives in exile and would be detained if she set foot in Russia.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Taiwan's defence ministry said Thursday it had detected 66 Chinese military aircraft around the island in a 24-hour window, a record-high this year, a day after it said Beijing was conducting exercises in nearby waters.</p>

<p>China -- which maintains a near-daily military presence around Taiwan -- claims the self-ruled island as part of its territory and has said it will never renounce the use of force to bring it under its control.</p>

<p>Thursday's record comes a day after Taipei spotted Chinese aircraft around the island that it said were headed to the western Pacific for exercises with the PLA aircraft carrier Shandong.</p>

<p>"66 PLA aircraft and seven PLAN vessels operating around Taiwan were detected up until 6 am (2200 GMT Wednesday) today," the defence ministry said in Thursday's statement, adding it has "responded accordingly".</p>

<p>Fifty-six of the Chinese aircraft crossed the sensitive median line bisecting the Taiwan Strait -- a narrow 180-kilometre (110-mile) waterway separating the island from China.</p>

<p>An illustration it released showed some of the aircraft came within 33 nautical miles (61 kilometres) of Taiwan's southern tip.</p>

<p>The year's previous record was in May, when Beijing sent 62 military aircraft and 27 naval vessels around Taiwan.</p>

<p>That occurred in the middle of war games Beijing launched on the heels of the inauguration of Taiwan President Lai Ching-te, who Beijing regards as a "dangerous separatist".</p>

<p>Military expert Su Tzu-yun said China's latest show of force was a reaction to recent political developments, including Washington's new de facto ambassador to Taiwan meeting with and expressing support for Taipei during a meeting with Lai on Wednesday.</p>

<p>"Beijing puts pressure on Taiwan in order to express its displeasure at the support it enjoys," said Su of Taiwan's Institute for National Defence and Security Research.</p>

<p>Defence minister Wellington Koo on Wednesday noted that the Shandong had not passed "through the Bashi Channel", the area off Taiwan's southern tip where Chinese ships typically transit en route to the Pacific Ocean.</p>

<p>Instead, it "went further south through the Balintang Channel towards the Western Pacific," he said, referring to a waterway just north of the Philippines' Babuyan Island -- about 250 kilometres south of Bashi.</p>

<p>Neighbouring Japan on Tuesday confirmed that four PLA navy vessels -- including the Shandong -- were sailing 520 kilometres southeast of Miyako island.</p>

<p>The Philippines' military public affairs chief said they had received reports of a China-Russia exercise taking place in the Philippine Sea but did not comment about the Shandong directly.</p>

<p><strong>'Restricted waters'</strong></p>

<p>China has in recent years ramped up political and military pressures around Taiwan, sending in record-breaking numbers of jets, drones and ships while upping the rhetoric of "unification" being "inevitable".</p>

<p>Lin Jian, spokesman of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, reiterated Thursday that "Taiwan is an inalienable part of China's territory".</p>

<p>"The determination and resolve of the Chinese people to safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity are unwavering," he said during a regular press briefing.</p>

<p>The largest number of aircraft ever seen around Taiwan came last September when Beijing sent in 103 warplanes and aircraft.</p>

<p>Experts call these "grey zone tactics", which stop short of outright acts of war but serve to exhaust the island's military.</p>

<p>Lai has repeatedly made overtures of dialogue to China, but has been largely rebuffed.</p>

<p>Besides deploying a military show of force, China has also increasingly sent coast guard ships around Taiwan's outlying islands this year.</p>

<p>On Thursday, four Chinese coast guard ships "sailed into (Taiwan's) waters" at 7 am, Taipei's coast guard said, adding that the vessels left after two hours.</p>

<p>Then at 10 am, the four ships "once again sailed in Kinmen's restricted waters at multiple points, and our patrol boats immediately moved forward to monitor", and they left around noon.</p>

<p>"So far this year the incursions into waters controlled by our side have reached 31 times," they said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

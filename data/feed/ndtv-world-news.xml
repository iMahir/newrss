       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Adidas said Friday it had dropped vocal pro-Palestinian model Bella Hadid from an advertising campaign for retro sneakers referencing the 1972 Munich Olympics, which were overshadowed by a massacre of Israeli athletes.</p>

<p>The German sportswear giant recently relaunched the SL72, a shoe first showcased by athletes at the 1972 Olympics, as part of a series reviving old classic sneakers.</p>

<p>Eleven Israeli athletes and a German police officer were killed at the 1972 Munich Games after gunmen from the Palestinian Black September group broke into the Olympic village and took them hostage.</p>

<p>Bella Hadid, who was born in the US but has Palestinian roots through her father, has been vocal about her support for Palestinian rights since the Hamas attack on Israel on October 7 triggered the war in Gaza.</p>

<p>Adidas said it would be "revising the remainder of the campaign" with immediate effect.</p>

<p>"We are conscious that connections have been made to tragic historical events -- though these are completely unintentional -- and we apologise for any upset or distress caused," the company said in a statement sent to AFP on Friday.</p>

<p><strong>'Collective memory'</strong></p>

<p>A spokeswoman confirmed that Bella Hadid had been removed from the campaign, which notes that the shoes were first introduced in 1972 but never mentions the terror attack on the Israeli athletes.</p>

<p>Pictures of the American model wearing the retro Adidas shoes had caused an outcry among pro-Israeli groups.</p>

<p>"Guess who the face of the campaign is? Bella Hadid, a model with Palestinian roots who has spread anti-Semitism in the past and incited violence against Israelis and Jews," the Israeli embassy in Germany wrote on X, formerly Twitter, on Thursday.</p>

<p>"How can Adidas now claim that the reference (to the events in Munich) was 'completely unintentional'?" Ron Prosor, Israel's ambassador to Germany, said in response to the company's climbdown.</p>

<p>"The terror of 1972 is etched into the collective memory of Germans and Israelis," he told Die Welt TV on Friday.</p>

<p>A flood of social media posts meanwhile expressed support for Bella Hadid, criticised Adidas for axing the model, and called for a boycott of the company.</p>

<p><strong>Pro-Palestinian demonstrations</strong></p>

<p>The Gaza war was triggered by the October 7 attack by Palestinian Hamas militants on southern Israel which resulted in the deaths of 1,195 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.</p>

<p>Israel's military retaliation to wipe out Hamas has killed at least 38,848 people, also mostly civilians, according to data from the health ministry in Hamas-ruled Gaza.</p>

<p>Bella Hadid has taken part in several pro-Palestinian demonstrations during the conflict and has described Israel's offensive as a "genocide".</p>

<p>In 2021, Bella Hadid, her sister Gigi Hadid and singer Dua Lipa were described as anti-Semitic in an advertisement published in The New York Times by a Jewish group called the World Values Network.</p>

<p>Adidas said it would be continuing the SL72 campaign with other famous faces including footballer Jules Kounde, singer Melissa Bon and model Sabrina Lan.</p>

<p>In late 2022, Adidas ended its contract with the US rapper now known formally as Ye after he triggered an outcry with a series of anti-Semitic social media posts.</p>

<p>Germany's response to the Hamas attack and ensuing war has been driven by guilt over its own dark past, and the slaughter of six million Jews by the Nazis during the Holocaust.</p>

<p>The country has steadfastly backed Israel in the conflict, but its unwavering stance has led to claims that Palestinian voices are being marginalised.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[US reporter Evan Gershkovich was sentenced by a Russian court on Friday to 16 years prison for "espionage", a verdict slammed as "despicable", "disgraceful" and a "sham" by Western governments and his employer.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US reporter Evan Gershkovich was sentenced by a Russian court on Friday to 16 years prison for "espionage", a verdict slammed as "despicable", "disgraceful" and a "sham" by Western governments and his employer.</p>

<p>Gershkovich was sentenced after just three court sessions in a secretive closed-door trial in the Urals City of Yekaterinburg, the city where he was arrested while on a reporting trip in March 2023.</p>

<p>After the sentencing, US President Joe Biden said Gershkovich was "targeted by the Russian government because he is a journalist and an American."</p>

<p>"There is no question that Russia is wrongfully detaining Evan," he said.</p>

<p>"We are pushing hard for Evan's release and will continue to do so," he added in a written statement published by the White House.</p>

<p>Both Washington and Moscow say talks over a prisoner swap are ongoing.</p>

<p>Russia has previously said its policy is not to trade people before they have been convicted, suggesting Friday's sentence could pave the way for the 32-year-old journalist to finally be swapped in a deal.</p>

<p>In court on Friday, Gershkovich did not appear to react to the sentencing, standing in a glass defendants' cage in dark trousers and a T-shirt. He waved to his journalist colleagues as he was led away.</p>

<p>Judge Andrei Mineyev said said Gershkovich would be sent to a "strict regime colony" -- a Russian prison camp notorious for harsh conditions and strict rules.</p>

<p><strong>'Disgraceful, sham conviction'</strong></p>

<p>The Wall Street Journal correspondent, who pleaded not guilty, became the first journalist in Russia to be charged with spying since the Cold War when he was detained in 2023.</p>

<p>He has spent almost 16 months in detention on charges the United States government and his employer have always said are fabricated.</p>

<p>"This disgraceful, sham conviction comes after Evan has spent 478 days in prison, wrongfully detained, away from his family and friends, prevented from reporting, all for doing his job as a journalist," the Journal's publisher Almar Latour and editor-in-chief Emma Tucker said in a statement.</p>

<p>Washington believes he is being held as a bargaining chip to secure the release of Russians convicted abroad.</p>

<p>His trial has moved rapidly since the first hearing in late June, with the prosecution and defence teams giving their final arguments on Friday.</p>

<p>Other similar cases in Russia have dragged on far more slowly, with several weeks or even months between hearings.</p>

<p>Western governments expressed outrage at the verdict.</p>

<p>British Prime Minister Keir Starmer called it "despicable," adding that it "only serves to underscore Russia's utter contempt for media freedom."</p>

<p>German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said the case was "politically motivated" and demonstrated Russian President Vladimir "Putin's fear of the power of facts."</p>

<p><strong>Talks ongoing</strong></p>

<p>The Kremlin has provided no public evidence for the espionage allegations, saying only that Gershkovich was caught "red-handed" spying on a tank factory in the Urals region while working for the CIA.</p>

<p>The prosecutor said Friday that Gershkovich acted with "careful measures of secrecy".</p>

<p>Tensions are running extremely high between the countries over Moscow's military offensive in Ukraine.</p>

<p>Moscow and Washington have both said they are open to exchanging the reporter in a deal, but neither has given clues on when that might happen.</p>

<p>When asked Friday, the Kremlin refused to speculate about the prospect of a prisoner swap.</p>

<p>Moscow's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Wednesday that talks between US and Russian special services over possible prisoner exchanges were ongoing, without naming any specific individuals.</p>

<p>Putin has implied he wants to see the release of Vadim Krasikov, a Russian convicted in Germany of killing a Chechen separatist commander. German judges said it was an assassination orchestrated by Russian authorities.</p>

<p>Among other US nationals detained in Russia are reporter Alsu Kurmasheva and ballerina Ksenia Karelina, who are both dual US-Russian citizens, and former US marine Paul Whelan, who is serving a 16-year sentence for spying.</p>

<p>In his statement Friday, Biden said he had "no higher priority than seeking the release and safe return of Evan, Paul Whelan and all Americans wrongfully detained and held hostage abroad."</p>

<p><strong>'Arbitrary' detention</strong></p>

<p>The US-born son of Soviet emigres raised in New Jersey, Gershkovich had reported from Russia since 2017, still returning for reporting trips following Russia's Ukraine offensive.</p>

<p>In Moscow's isolated Lefortovo prison, where he was held for more than a year in pre-trial detention, he communicated with friends and family in hand-written letters that revealed he had not lost hope.</p>

<p>A United Nations working group this month stated that Gershkovich's detention on spying charges was "arbitrary" and called for his release.</p>

<p>The White House has warned US citizens still in Russia to "depart immediately" due to the risk of wrongful arrest.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden is "absolutely" staying in the race for the White House, his campaign chair said Friday, despite mounting pressure from Democratic allies to step aside over worries about his age and health.</p>

<p>Jen O'Malley Dillon acknowledged there had been some "slippage" in support since the 81-year-old's disastrous debate performance against Donald Trump, but insisted he would still win in November.</p>

<p>"Absolutely the president's in this race," Jen O'Malley Dillon told MSNBC's Morning Joe program. "Joe Biden is more committed than ever to beat Donald Trump."</p>

<p>She added: "You have heard from the president directly time and again, he is in this race to win, and he is our nominee, and he's going to be our president for a second term."</p>

<p>Biden is currently holed up at his beach house in Delaware self-isolating with Covid.</p>

<p>Senior Democrats including former president Barack Obama, former House speaker Nancy Pelosi and the party's current leaders in the Senate and House have all reportedly expressed concerns that he will lose the election.</p>

<p>Twenty Democrats in the US House and two senators have meanwhile called on him to step aside from the race.</p>

<p>O'Malley Dillon, Biden's former deputy chief of staff, admitted that the campaign had faced a difficult time since he appeared tired and confused in the June 27 debate.</p>

<p>"I'm not here to say that this hasn't been a tough several weeks for the campaign," she said.</p>

<p>"There's no doubt that it has been, and we've definitely seen some slippage in support, but it has been a small movement."</p>

<p>A series of recent polls have shown Biden behind Trump in the 2024 race, including in all key battleground states.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the International Court of Justice made a "decision of lies" on Friday by ruling Israel's occupation of the Palestinian territories illegal.</p>

<p>Netanyahu led a chorus of condemnation of the UN court's ruling from conservative, far-right and even centrist politicians in Israel.</p>

<p>"The Jewish people are not occupiers in their own land -- not in our eternal capital Jerusalem, nor in our ancestral heritage of Judea and Samaria" (the occupied West Bank), Netanyahu said in a statement.</p>

<p>"No decision of lies in The Hague will distort this historical truth, and similarly, the legality of Israeli settlements in all parts of our homeland cannot be disputed."</p>

<p>Itamar Ben Gvir, the far-right national security minister and an outspoken champion of Jewish settlement expansion in the occupied West Bank, said: "The decision in The Hague proves yet again - this is a blatantly anti-Semitic and political organisation.</p>

<p>"We will not accept moral preaching from them," the minister said in comments sent to AFP by a spokesperson.</p>

<p>Ben Gvir called for Israel to seek "sovereignty" of the occupied territories through annexation.</p>

<p>Far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich too called for steps towards annexation of the West Bank, posting on social media platform X: "The answer to The Hague - sovereignty now."</p>

<p>Centrist opposition leader Yair Lapid criticised the court's ruling, calling it "disconnected, one-sided, tainted with anti-Semitism and lacking an understanding of the reality on the ground".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel's decades-long occupation of the Palestinian territories is illegal and needs to end "as rapidly as possible", the UN's top court said Friday.</p>

<p>The UN's General Assembly asked the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in late 2022 to give an "advisory opinion" on the "legal consequences arising from the policies and practices of Israel in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem".</p>

<p>"The court has found that Israel's continued presence in the Palestinian Territories is illegal," ICJ presiding judge Nawaf Salam said Friday, adding: "Israel must end the occupation as rapidly as possible."</p>

<p>"The Court has found that Israel's... continued presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory is illegal," Salam said.</p>

<p>"The State of Israel is under the obligation to bring an end to its unlawful presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory as rapidly as possible," the judge said.</p>

<p>The ICJ held a week-long session in February to hear submissions from countries following the request -- supported by most countries within the assembly.</p>

<p>Most speakers during the hearings called on Israel to end its 57-year occupation. They warned a prolonged occupation posed an "extreme danger" to stability in the Middle East and beyond.</p>

<p>But the United States said Israel should not be legally obliged to withdraw without taking its "very real security needs" into account.</p>

<p>Israel did not take part in the oral hearings.</p>

<p>Instead, it submitted a written contribution in which it described the questions the court had been asked as "prejudicial" and "tendentious".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bangladeshi student protesters stormed a prison and freed hundreds of inmates Friday as police struggled to quell unrest, with huge rallies in the capital Dhaka despite a police ban on public gatherings.</p>

<p>This week's unrest has killed at least 64 people, according to an AFP count of victims reported by hospitals, and emerged as an unprecedented threat to Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's autocratic government after 15 years in office.</p>

<p>Student protesters stormed a jail in the central Bangladeshi district of Narsingdi and freed the facility's inmates before setting the facility on fire, a police officer told AFP on condition of anonymity.</p>

<p>"I don't know the number of inmates, but it would be in the hundreds," he added.</p>

<p>Dhaka's police force took the drastic step of banning all public gatherings for the day -- a first since protests began -- in an effort to forestall another day of violence.</p>

<p>"We've banned all rallies, processions and public gatherings in Dhaka today," police chief Habibur Rahman told AFP, adding the move was necessary to ensure "public safety".</p>

<p>That did not stop another round of confrontations between police and protesters around the sprawling megacity of 20 million people, despite an internet shutdown aimed at frustrating the organisation of rallies.</p>

<p>"Our protest will continue," Sarwar Tushar, who joined a march in the capital and sustained minor injuries when it was violently dispersed by police, told AFP.</p>

<p>"We want the immediate resignation of Sheikh Hasina. The government is responsible for the killings."</p>

<p>At least 19 people were killed in the city on Friday, according to a list drawn up by the Dhaka Medical College Hospital and seen by AFP.</p>

<p>Police fire was the cause of more than half of the deaths reported so far this week, based on descriptions given to AFP by hospital staff.</p>

<p>The capital's police force earlier said protesters had on Thursday torched, vandalised and carried out "destructive activities" on numerous police and government offices.</p>

<p>Among them was the Dhaka headquarters of state broadcaster Bangladesh Television, which remains offline after hundreds of incensed students stormed the premises and set fire to a building.</p>

<p>"About 100 policemen were injured in the clashes yesterday," Dhaka Metropolitan Police spokesman Faruk Hossain told AFP Hossain told AFP. "Around 50 police booths were burnt".</p>

<p>Hossain said police had arrested Ruhul Kabir Rizvi Ahmed, the joint secretary of the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP).</p>

<p>"He faces hundreds of cases," Hossain said, without giving further details on the reasons for Ahmed's detention.</p>

<p><strong>'Symbol of a rigged system'</strong></p>

<p>Near-daily marches this month have called for an end to a quota system that reserves more than half of civil service posts for specific groups, including children of veterans from the country's 1971 liberation war against Pakistan.</p>

<p>Critics say the scheme benefits children of pro-government groups that back Hasina, 76, who has ruled the country since 2009 and won her fourth consecutive election in January after a vote without genuine opposition.</p>

<p>Hasina's government is accused by rights groups of misusing state institutions to entrench its hold on power and stamp out dissent, including by the extrajudicial killing of opposition activists.</p>

<p>Her administration this week ordered schools and universities to close indefinitely as police stepped up efforts to bring the deteriorating law and order situation under control.</p>

<p>"This is an eruption of the simmering discontent of a youth population built over years due to economic and political disenfranchisement," Ali Riaz, a politics professor at Illinois State University, told AFP.</p>

<p>"The job quotas became the symbol of a system which is rigged and stacked against them by the regime."</p>

<p><strong>'Nation-scale' internet shutdown</strong></p>

<p>Students say they are determined to press on with protests despite Hasina giving a national address on the now-offline state broadcaster seeking to calm the unrest.</p>

<p>Nearly half of Bangladesh's 64 districts reported clashes on Thursday, broadcaster Independent Television reported.</p>

<p>The network said more than 700 people had been wounded throughout the day including 104 police officers and 30 journalists.</p>

<p>London-based watchdog Netblocks said Friday that a "nation-scale" internet shutdown remained in effect a day after it was imposed.</p>

<p>"The disruption prevents families from contacting each other and stifles efforts to document human rights violations," it wrote on social media platform X.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Instead of buying her new shoes, she forced the girl to walk barefoot on the scorching asphalt road for at least 20 minutes.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Parents discipline their children and teach them important life values in a variety of ways. However, a woman in Taiwan went to extremes by making her six-year-old daughter walk barefoot on hot pavement as a form of punishment.&nbsp;According to the <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scmp.com/news/people-culture/trending-china/article/3270894/cruel-taiwan-mother-panned-making-daughter-6-walk-barefoot-scorching-concrete">South China Morning Post</a></em>, the incident happened on July 14 in Hsinchu City, northern Taiwan, when the temperature reached 34 degrees Celsius.</p>

<p>Notably, the woman was angry at her daughter for losing her shoes. Instead of buying her new footwear,&nbsp; she forced the girl to walk barefoot on the scorching asphalt road for at least 20 minutes.&nbsp;The little girl cried out while walking on the hot pavement, saying: ''Mum, it's so hot, my feet hurt so much.''&nbsp;She was seen jumping to keep her feet off the hot pavement, but her mother continued to drag her along.</p>

<p>A woman who witnessed the incident asked the mother why the girl was not wearing shoes, to which she replied, ''The child lost it herself and I don't have money to buy her shoes.''</p>

<p data-qa="Component-Component" datatype="p">''Isn't this too cruel? What you are doing is child abuse,'' the passer-by said.&nbsp;</p>

<p data-qa="Component-Component" datatype="p">''Go ahead and call the police if you want,'' the girl's mother shouted back.</p>

<p>The concerned woman also offered to buy shoes for the child, but the mother refused. She then followed the mother-daughter duo for 20 minutes and then&nbsp;called the police. After receiving a report from the passerby, the local government sent social workers to the woman's home to investigate. They found blisters and burns on the girl's feet and took her to the hospital.</p>

<p>The case has now been reported to the Hsinchu County Social Affairs Department and will be investigated for potential abuse.&nbsp;If it is determined to be an isolated incident, the mother will be required to attend parent-child education courses. However, if regular abuse is found, the Social Affairs Department will intervene.</p>

<p>Internet users reacted strongly to the incident, slamming the mother for mistreating her child. One user wrote, ''If it is determined to be an isolated incident, the mother will be required to attend parent-child education courses. However, if regular abuse is found, the Social Affairs Department will intervene.''</p>

<p>Another commented, ''I hope social organisations can protect this little girl. The mother needs education. She does not know how to love her child.''</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Airlines, banks and businesses across the world were scrambling today to deal with one of the biggest IT crashes in recent years, caused by an update to an antivirus program. The US grounded all planes briefly; flights in other nations were affected.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<ol>
	<li>Microsoft said the issue began at 1900 GMT on Thursday, affecting users of its Azure cloud platform running cybersecurity software CrowdStrike Falcon. "We recommend customers that are able to, to restore from a backup from before this time," the US software giant said in a technical update on its website.</li>
	<li>CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz said in a post on several social media platforms that a fix had been rolled out for the problem, describing it as a "defect found in a single content update for Windows hosts".</li>
	<li>From Amsterdam to Zurich, Singapore to Hong Kong, airport operators flagged technical issues that were disrupting their services. Some airports told planes they could not land, while in others airline staff began checking in passengers manually.</li>
	<li>In India, several airports issued handwritten boarding passes to passengers. Many IndiGo flights in Bengaluru, Mumbai, and Hyderabad airports were cancelled and rescheduled.</li>
	<li>Civil Aviation Minister Rammohan Naidu said the ministry and Airports Authority of India (AAI) are actively managing the situation using manual methods to ensure minimal disruption. "Passengers are advised to cooperate with airport staff during this period of disruption. We have instructed all airlines and airport authorities to keep passengers informed about their flight status and provide necessary assistance," he said.</li>
	<li>The global nature of the software failure prompted some commentators to question the reliance on a single provider for such a variety of services. Shares in CrowdStrike slumped by 20 per cent in pre-market trading.</li>
	<li>Companies were left patching up their systems and trying to assess the damage from the outage, even as officials tried to tamp down any panic. "There is no evidence to suggest that this outage is the result of a cyberattack," France's cybersecurity agency ANSSI said.</li>
	<li>Reports from both the Netherlands and Britain suggested health services may have been affected by the disruption, meaning the impact could eventually be even wider. Media companies were also struggling, with Britain's Sky News saying the glitch had ended its morning news broadcasts and Australia's ABC similarly reporting a major "outage".</li>
	<li>Banks in Kenya and Ukraine reported difficulties with some digital services, supermarkets in Australia had issues with payments, mobile phone carriers were disrupted and customer services in a number of companies went down.</li>
	<li>Asian and European stock markets mostly sank after the outage rocked global computer systems. The London Stock Exchange saw a delayed start to trading due to the glitch, which also affected airports, airlines, trains, banks, shops and even doctors' surgeries.</li>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump's speech accepting the Republican presidential nomination lasted one hour and 32 minutes, the longest in modern United States history. Here are five key moments and themes punctuating the often rambling delivery.</p>

<p><strong>Fight, fight!</strong></p>

<p>Trump's speech had been billed by aides as set to herald a new, softer tone in the wake of surviving his assassination attempt last Saturday.</p>

<p>But the vibe was often harsh -- and literally pugilistic.</p>

<p>"Fight, fight!" was the chant led by Trump's son Eric before the big speech, in homage to his father's words on the rally stage last weekend, as he got up from being injured in the shooting.</p>

<p>The man introducing Trump to the podium was none other than his friend Dana White, chief executive of the wildly popular and bloody UFC martial arts network.</p>

<p>Before White, the crowd got to hear from colorful 1980s pro-wrestler Hulk Hogan.</p>

<p><strong>Kiss, kiss</strong></p>

<p>There were kisses too.</p>

<p>One was blown by Trump to Hulk Hogan in appreciation.</p>

<p>Trump also paid homage by kissing the helmet of firefighter Corey Comperatore, who was killed during the shooting at last weekend's rally. Trump asked the crowd to observe a moment of silence for the victim, whose firefighter's uniform was displayed on the stage.</p>

<p>At the end of the speech, Trump was joined by his wife Melania, who has been notably absent during his campaign for a return to the White House in November. He took her hand and pecked her on the cheek.</p>

<p><strong>God</strong></p>

<p>Trump has never been much of a churchgoer in public, even as president, but he attributed his survival of the shooting to God.</p>

<p>"I stand before you in this arena only by the grace of Almighty God," he said.</p>

<p>"There was blood pouring everywhere and yet in a certain way I felt very safe because I had God on my side."</p>

<p>His narrow escape has been heralded by many supporters as a sign that Trump has even been chosen by God. One of the warm-up speakers was evangelist preacher Franklin Graham -- whose father was spiritual adviser to multiple US presidents.</p>

<p><strong>Don't mention Biden</strong></p>

<p>Aides had said Trump would not mention Biden at all. This would fit with the message being given by the campaign that Trump is on a roll, while the Democratic president is struggling.</p>

<p>But Trump claimed that "the damage Biden has done" was worse than damage done by all the "10 worst presidents in the history of the United States."</p>

<p>He then said he was "only going to use the term once."</p>

<p>"I'm not going to use the name anymore," he said.</p>

<p>There were certainly no well-wishes expressed by Trump or any other speaker for Biden as he recovers from Covid-19.</p>

<p><strong>Tale of two speeches</strong></p>

<p>The speech had been billed as a somber, unity-seeking address inspired by the experience of surviving an attempted assassination.</p>

<p>For about quarter of an hour, it sounded something like that.</p>

<p>But over the next hour-plus, it was Trump reverting to regular Trump, with his trademark blend of anecdotes, jokes, jibes and entirely false claims.</p>

<p>It began with promising to be a president for "all Americans."</p>

<p>It soon turned into a torrent of attacks on "crazy" Democratic ex-speaker Nancy Pelosi, the immigrant "invasion" consisting of lunatics and dangerous criminals, and claiming that he was robbed of victory in the 2020 election.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Simon Boas, who wrote a candid account of living with cancer, passed away on July 15 at the age of 47. In a recent <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/clmykzrdnljo">BBC interview</a>, the former aid worker told the reporter: “My pain is under control and I'm terribly happy – it sounds weird to say, but I'm as happy as I've ever been in my life.”</p>

<p>It may seem odd that a person could be happy as the end draws near, but in my experience as a clinical psychologist working with people at the end of their lives, it's not that uncommon.</p>

<p>There is quite a lot of research suggesting that fear of death is at the unconscious centre of being human. William James, an American philosopher, called the knowledge that we must die <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/170217/the-worm-at-the-core-by-sheldon-solomon-jeff-greenberg-and-tom-pyszczynski/">“the worm at the core”</a> of the human condition.</p>

<p>But a <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/44577785">study</a> in Psychological Science shows that people nearing death use more positive language to describe their experience than those who just imagine death. This suggests that the experience of dying is more pleasant – or, at least, less unpleasant – than we might picture it.</p>

<p>In the BBC interview, Boas shared some of the insights that helped him come to accept his situation. He mentioned the importance of enjoying life and prioritising meaningful experiences, suggesting that acknowledging death can enhance our appreciation for life.</p>

<p>Despite the pain and difficulties, Boas seemed cheerful, hoping his attitude would support his wife and parents during the difficult times ahead.</p>

<p>Boas's words echo the Roman philosopher Seneca who <a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Moral_letters_to_Lucilius/Letter_61">advised that</a>: “To have lived long enough depends neither upon our years nor upon our days, but upon our minds.”</p>

<p>A more recent thinker expressing similar sentiments is the psychiatrist <a href="https://www.viktorfrankl.org/">Viktor Frankl</a> who, after surviving Auschwitz, wrote <a href="https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/347571/mans-search-for-meaning-by-viktor-e-frankl/9781846046384">Man's Search for Meaning</a> (1946) in which he lay the groundwork for a form of existential psychotherapy, with the focus of discovering meaning in any kind of circumstance. Its most recent adaptation is meaning-centred psychotherapy, which offers people with cancer a way to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4861219/">improve their sense of meaning</a>.</p>

<h2>How happiness and meaning relate</h2>

<p>In two recent studies, in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/S1478951521000262">Palliative and Supportive Care</a> and the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/1049909120939857">American Journal of Hospice and Palliative Care</a>, people approaching death were asked what constitutes happiness for them. Common themes in both studies were social connections, enjoying simple pleasures such as being in nature, having a positive mindset and a general shift in focus from seeking pleasure to finding meaning and fulfilment as their illness progressed.</p>

<p>In my work as a clinical psychologist, I sometimes meet people who have – or eventually arrive at – a similar outlook on life as Boas. One person especially comes to mind – let's call him Johan.</p>

<p>The first time I met Johan, he came to the clinic by himself, with a slight limp. We talked about life, about interests, relationships and meaning. Johan appeared to be lucid, clear and articulate.</p>

<p>The second time, he came with crutches. One foot had begun to lag and he couldn't trust his balance. He said it was frustrating to lose control of his foot, but still hoped to cycle around Mont Blanc.</p>

<p>When I asked him what his concerns were, he burst into tears. He said: “That I won't get to celebrate my birthday next month.” We sat quietly for a while and took in the situation. It wasn't the moment of death itself that weighed on him the most, it was all the things he wouldn't be able to do again.</p>

<p>Johan arrived at our third meeting supported by a friend, no longer able to grip the crutches. He told me that he had been watching films of him cycling with his friends. He had concluded that he could watch YouTube videos of others cycling around Mont Blanc. He had even ordered a new, expensive mountain bike. “I've wanted to buy it for a long time, but was tightfisted,” he said. “I may not be able to ride it, but thought it would be cool to have in the living room.”</p>

<p>For the fourth visit, he arrived in a wheelchair. It turned out to be the last time we met. The bike had arrived; he had it next to the couch. There was one more thing he wanted to do.</p>

<p>“If by some miracle I were to get out of this alive, I would like to volunteer in domestic care services – one or two shifts a week,” Johan said. “They work hard and it gets crazy sometimes, but they make such an incredible contribution. I wouldn't have been able to get out of the apartment without them.”</p>

<p>My experience of patients with life-threatening disease is that it's possible to feel happiness alongside sadness, and other seemingly conflicting emotions. Over a day, patients can feel gratitude, remorse, longing, anger, guilt and relief – sometimes all at once. Facing the limits of existence can add perspective and help a person appreciate life more than ever.<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The UK's airports and trains experienced delays, with the London Stock Exchange and the National Health Service among the other organisations in the country dealing with the fallout of a global IT outage today that has grounded planes and caused chaos around the world.</p>

<p>The outage, believed to be related to an issue at US-headquartered prolific cybersecurity firm Crowdstrike and Microsoft, seems to be affecting Windows PCs globally and has also forced 'Sky News' off the air.</p>

<p>London's biggest airport, Heathrow, said in a statement that its "flights are operational though we are experiencing delays". While the airport said it is implementing contingency plans to minimise impact, Gatwick Airport said passengers "may experience some delays" when checking in and passing through security. Luton and Edinburgh Airport, meanwhile, switched to manual systems to support operations.</p>

<p>The London Stock Exchange Group said trading continues to operate as normal while it is working on resolving an issue with its RNS Service, which provides the Regulatory News Service announcements.</p>

<p>The IT outage, which is not believed to be linked with a malicious attack or hack, also hit several National Health Service (NHS) general practitioner (GP) surgeries around the UK as they were unable to access patient records or book online appointments.</p>

<p>NHS England said the IT outage is "causing disruption in the majority of GP practices" in England, but there is currently no known impact on its 999 or emergency services.</p>

<p>"We are unable to access driver diagrams at certain locations, leading to potential short-notice cancellations, particularly on the Thameslink and Great Northern networks," said Govia Thameslink Railway, one of the train companies impacted.</p>

<p>"Additionally, other key systems, including our real-time customer information platforms, are also affected," it added.</p>

<p>National Rail, in charge of the country's railway network, said its IT teams are "actively investigating to determine the root cause of the problem".</p>

<p>The first reports of the outage seem to have emanated from the United States late on Thursday after a breakdown of Microsoft services such as Azure and 365.</p>

<p>In a post on X, Microsoft 365 Status stated that "multiple services are continuing to see improvements in availability as our mitigation actions progress".<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A global tech outage was disrupting operations across multiple industries on Friday, with airlines halting flights, some broadcasters off air and services from banking to healthcare hit by system problems.</p>

<p>Cybersecurity firm Crowdstrike said it was working with customers impacted by a defect found in a single content update for Microsoft Windows hosts.</p>

<p>Here are some of the biggest tech outages in recent years, in chronological order:</p>

<p><strong>British Airways</strong></p>

<p>IAG-owned British Airways was hit by a major computer system failure in May 2017 that stranded 75,000 passengers over a holiday weekend, sparking a public relations disaster and pledges from the carrier that it would do better in future. According to media reports, the blackout was caused by a maintenance contractor who accidentally switched off power.</p>

<p><strong>Alphabet</strong></p>

<p>Some of Google's most popular services including YouTube, Gmail and Google Drive were down for an hour during an outage on Dec. 14, 2020. According to outage monitoring website DownDetector, more than 12,000 YouTube users were affected in various parts of the world, including the United States, Britain and India.</p>

<p><strong>Fastly</strong></p>

<p>In June 2021, thousands of government, news and social media websites across the globe were hit by a widespread hour-long outage linked to U.S.-based cloud company Fastly. The issue affected several high traffic sites including Reddit, Amazon, CNN, PayPal, Spotify, Al Jazeera Media Network and the New York Times with outages ranging from a few minutes to around an hour.</p>

<p><strong>Akamai</strong></p>

<p>Websites of dozens of financial institutions and airlines in Australia and the United States were briefly down on June 17, 2021, due to server-related glitches at content delivery network provider Akamai. According to the firm, the problem was caused by a bug in its software.</p>

<p><strong>Meta</strong></p>

<p>Meta-owned social media platforms Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram went dark for six hours on Oct. 4, 2021, with 10.6 million users reporting problems worldwide. The company said the outage was caused by a faulty configuration change.</p>

<p><strong>X Corp</strong></p>

<p>Social media platform Twitter suffered a major outage on Dec. 28, 2022, leaving tens of thousands of users globally unable to access the popular social media platform or use its key features for several hours before services appeared to come back online. Downdetector tracked more than 10,000 affected users from the United States, about 2,500 from Japan and about 2,500 from the UK at the peak of the disruption.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hours after a building near the US embassy in Tel Aviv came under attack, Israeli organisations have posted dramatic footage of a drone flying across the city's skyline and zoning in on its target.</p>

<p>The video shows the drone slicing through the Israeli commercial capital's skyline, passing very close to a skyscraper before hitting a residential building. There is an explosion followed by a fire.</p>

<p>Posting the video, the X handle of the Israeli foreign ministry said the unmanned aerial vehicle entered Israel from the West</p>

<p>"It appears that this is a Simad 3 UAV, which we estimate travelled from Yemen to Tel Aviv. The Simad 3 is an Iranian weapon system that has likely been upgraded to extend its flight range. As a result of the impact, one civilian was killed, and eight civilians were lightly injured. May the memory of the victim be a blessing and may the injured have a speedy recovery," it wrote.</p>

<p></p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p></p>

<p>The Israel Defense Forces also posted the video and wrote that it will continue to protect Israelis against terrorism.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The drone attack, which hit a building 100 metres from the US embassy annex, has been claimed by the Houthis in Yemen.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>'Human Error'</strong></p>

<p>The Houthis fired a "new drone called 'Yafa', which is capable of bypassing the enemy's interception systems," the Iran-backed Yemeni movement's spokesman, Yahya Saree, said.</p>

<p>According to a report by news agency AFP, an Israeli military official said a "very big" drone was used in the attack on Israel's commercial capital, explaining that "human error" led to it not being intercepted.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Houthis have launched scores of drone and missile attacks on shipping vessels in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden since November in a campaign they say is an act of solidarity with Palestinians.</p>

<p>They have also repeatedly claimed to have struck Israeli cities, including Eilat, Ashdod and Haifa, in the past, but Friday's attack appears to be the first by the group to have breached Israel's intricate air defences.</p>

<p>Police said one man was found "dead in his apartment" and had suffered shrapnel wounds.</p>

<p>In recent weeks, the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, a loose alliance of Iran-backed groups, has claimed drone strikes against targets in Israel, labelling many of them "joint operations" with the Houthis.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pakistani authorities said Friday they had arrested a "close associate" of Al-Qaeda founder and mastermind of the 9/11 attacks Osama Bin Laden.</p>

<p>Counter-terrorism officials in the most populous province of Punjab swooped in on Amin Ul-Haq in the city of Gujrat, accusing him of planning "sabotage activities" and seeking to "target important installations" in the country.</p>

<p>"The arrest of Amin Ul-Haq is a major victory in the ongoing efforts to combat terrorism in Pakistan and worldwide," a statement from Punjab's Counter Terrorism Department said.</p>

<p>He was listed by the United States, the European Union, and the United Nations as an associate of Al-Qaeda and Bin Laden, the head of Punjab's counter-terrorism department, Usman Akram Gonadal, said in a press conference.</p>

<p>"He resurfaced after the withdrawal of western NATO forces (from Afghanistan). He visited Afghanistan in August and he began his efforts to reorganise Al-Qaeda."</p>

<p>US troops backed by NATO toppled the Taliban's first regime in 2001 for refusing to hand over Al-Qaeda terrorists behind the 9/11 attacks.</p>

<p>Bin Laden was later discovered living in Pakistan and shot dead in a nighttime US operation in 2011.</p>

<p>The Taliban took back power in Afghanistan in 2021, kicking out the foreign-backed government after two decades of fighting US and NATO troops.</p>

<p>Militancy has since surged along Pakistan's border, with Islamabad accusing Kabul's rulers of failing to root out groups taking shelter on Afghan soil while preparing assaults on Pakistan.</p>

<p>The Taliban government insists it will not allow foreign terrrorists outfits to operate from Afghanistan, but Islamabad-Kabul relations have soured over the issue.</p>

<p>Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has announced a sweeping new military campaign to control the violence.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Paris Olympics organisers said on Friday they were experiencing problems linked to a major worldwide computer systems outage, a week before the Games' opening ceremony takes place.</p>

<p>The issues came as a major outage wrought havoc on computer systems worldwide, grounding flights in the United States, derailing television broadcasts in the UK and impacting telecommunications in Australia.</p>

<p>"Paris 2024 is aware of global technical issues affecting Microsoft software. These issues are impacting Paris 2024's IT operations," organisers said.</p>

<p>"Paris 2024's technical teams have been fully mobilised to mitigate the impacts of these issues and we have activated contingency plans in order to continue operations," they added.</p>

<p>A source at the Paris Olympic Games organising committee said the problem is affecting the accreditation system with some people unable to pick up badges before next Friday's ceremony on the River Seine.</p>

<p>The source added it could also affect the arrival of athletes who have had flights cancelled after the athletes' Olympic village welcomed its first guests on Thursday.</p>

<p>The London Stock Exchange (LSE), airports in Spain, the Netherlands and Hong Kong as well as production at US carmaker Tesla's plant outside Berlin have also been disrupted.</p>

<p>Microsoft said in a statement it was taking "mitigation actions" in response to service issues.</p>

<p>It was not clear if those were linked to the global outages.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>For the 725,000 Indian immigrants living in the U.S. without a visa, the third-largest group of undocumented immigrants, President Joe Biden's recent executive order on immigration brings much-needed relief. It eases the path to employment and citizenship for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients, or 'dreamers', that is, undocumented residents who were brought to the US as children. Around 2,000 of such "dreamers" in the US are Indian, and they are now eligible to apply for employment-based visas, like the H1-B. The executive order also lifted some application requirements for undocumented spouses of US citizens. However, for the nearly 1.6 million Indian citizens residing legally in the U.S., neither Biden nor Trump have delivered meaningful reforms, though both presidential candidates have indicated support for high-skilled, employment-based immigration from India.</p>

<p>Dip Patel is a "documented dreamer." Brought to the US as a child by Indian parents on H1-B visas, he faced self-deportation (voluntary departure from the country in advance of legal proceedings) at the age of 21 if he did not qualify for an employment visa. "When I was in high school, I realised that every decision and choice that I was making would impact my ability to remain in the country," he said. "Later, I would learn that this is something that's affecting not just me but thousands of people like me."&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Narrow Avenues</strong></h2>

<p>Patel founded Improve the Dream, a youth-led grassroots organisation, to advocate for around 2 lakh "documented dreamers" in the US, most of whom are Indian-American. These are immigrants like Patel who face self-deportation because their parents did not receive a green card - for which the wait could be 134 years - before they turned 21. The H1-B lottery, the primary pathway to remaining in the states for 'documented dreamers', had an approval rate of 14.6% in FY2024.</p>

<p>"With the current lottery system, the chance of visa approval is very low, and that's going to go down even more, since there's going to be many more DACA recipients applying," says Patel. "And that's absolutely not to say that they don't deserve that opportunity - rather that the administration must prioritise [systemic reform]." Indians were granted 74.1% of H1-B visas in 2021, which remains the primary mode of immigration from India to the US.</p>

<p>"Nothing good has happened in 34 years," says Charles Foster, senior immigration advisor to George Bush and Barack Obama, and former president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association (famously portrayed in Mao's Last Dancer). "I've known Biden since I supported his first presidential campaign in 1988, and his heart is in the right position. [But] Congress has not enacted major legislation on immigration since 1990."</p>

<h2><strong>Immigration Still A Sticky Issue</strong></h2>

<p>Congresswoman Deborah Ross, member of the House India Caucus and immigration subcommittee of the Judiciary committee, is one of the staunchest advocates in the Congress immigration reform. "The good news is that we now have bipartisan, bicameral legislation to include 'documented dreamers' with the original dreamers...that passed the House twice. But we are not moving on immigration issues because of the political fights and the fights over the border," she said. Patel added that "any sort of immigration bill is very, very hard right now [due to Republican opposition]".</p>

<p>The pressing issue is the annual cap of H1-B issuances to 65,000 a year, and country quotas on green cards of 7%, which means that no single country can receive more than 7% of the annual employment-based green card allotment. For the 1.1 million Indians stuck in the green card backlog, this could mean a lifetime of waiting; for the thousands of Indian applicants in the H1-B lottery, it could mean deportation.</p>

<p>"The problem is that the right wing of the Republican Party is not willing to admit that we need more workers and more skilled workers in this country," says Rep. Ross. "I absolutely believe voters that care about positive immigration reform are being completely overlooked. I have a growing Asian-American and Latino community in my district. Every time I talk to the Chamber of Commerce, I hear about this issue. It's the number one issue for the hospitality and restaurant industry."</p>

<h2><strong>'I Need Staff'</strong></h2>

<p>Kiran Verma, one of the most celebrated Indian chefs in America, who was invited to the White House by the Obamas, says: "I have been running Kiran's in Houston for over two decades and never has the situation been so dire with a dearth of trained manpower. I need chefs, I need wait staff, I need managers. It used to be so much easier to get them from India. Now, even the best talent can't come because the process is so cumbersome."</p>

<p>Trump, however, is even less likely than Biden to be an ally for Indian immigrants, even if they are college-educated. "He said things like this even before his last term, but his actual record shows that he made it worse for legal immigrants," said Patel. "He walked back his claims about green cards the very next day." Project 2025, the recently released policy playbook for a second Trump presidency, proposes to use backlog numbers to trigger the automatic suspension of application intake for large categories, among other restrictions on immigration.</p>

<p>The question remains whether positive immigration reform will be a decisive factor in the election, particularly at a time when support for Biden among Indian-American voters has declined by 19% since the debate. Even for Indian-Americans who support Trump, immigration remains an important issue. Jugal Malani, CEO of Unique Group Industries and president of India House Houston (and organiser of Howdy Modi in 2019), says that while he does still support Trump in 2024, "I absolutely support immigration reform: this country runs on immigrants."</p>

<h2><strong>The Risk Of Losing Talent</strong></h2>

<p>Rep. Ross said, "I was in India less than a year ago. And what I heard was that the younger people in India, many of whom have come to my district for advanced degrees and to do amazing work, now don't think it's worth it. And so they're staying in India, and India, frankly, likes that." Indeed, there was a 38% drop in overall H1-B applications for FY2025. "We're going to lose talent - and when we lose talent, we lose our competitiveness," she said.</p>

<p>Verma agrees. "My journey would not have been fulfilled had the immigration laws been the same as today. The promise of the American dream must go on. I hope we can fix the issue with whoever comes to power this November in the White House," he says.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In its first statement after the massive Microsoft outage caused by an update to CrowdStrike 'Falcon Sensor', the security firm's CEO has said the issue has been isolated and a fix has been deployed. He has also apologised for the outage's impact on customers, adding that some systems could take time to recover.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The bug has affected many stock exchanges, supermarkets and flight operations across the globe. Users are experiencing the Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) error, which is causing their systems to shut down or restart unexpectedly.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a statement on X, CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz said that the company is working with customers who have been impacted by a defect found in a single content update for Windows hosts, adding that Mac- and Linux-based systems have not been affected.</p>

<p>Emphasising that the outage is not a security incident or cyberattack, he wrote, &nbsp;"The issue has been identified, isolated and a fix has been deployed. We refer customers to the support portal for the latest updates and will continue to provide complete and continuous updates on our website."</p>

<p></p>

<p>"We further recommend organizations ensure they're communicating with CrowdStrike representatives through official channels. Our team is fully mobilized to ensure the security and stability of CrowdStrike customers," he added.</p>

<p>Speaking to the ‘Today' programme on NBC News later, Mr Kurtz said his company would make sure every customer is “fully recovered”.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We are deeply sorry for the impact that we have caused to customers, to travellers, to anyone affected by this, including our company," he was quoted as saying by news agency Reuters.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Many of the customers are rebooting the system and it's coming up and it'll be operational… It could be some time for some systems that won't automatically recover," he added, but the company "would make sure every customer is fully recovered".</p>

<p><strong>What Microsoft Said</strong></p>

<p>In a statement earlier on Friday, Microsoft said, "We remain committed in treating this event with the highest priority and urgency while we continue to address the lingering impact for the Microsoft 365 apps that are in a degraded state."&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Our services are still seeing continuous improvements while we continue to take mitigation actions," it added.</p>

<p><strong>Workarounds</strong></p>

<p>In an advisory, the Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In) has said the following method can be used as a workaround:</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>High drama was witnessed on Wednesday evening when an armed robbery suspect with an infant in the back seat, led law enforcement on a high-speed chase throughout Los Angeles County. The suspect even livestreamed parts of the dangerous chase on Instagram. As per&nbsp;<em><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/losangeles/news/authorities-in-pursuit-of-a-robbery-suspect-from-hawthorne/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">CBS News Los Angeles</a></em>, the pursuit began when the Hawthorne Police Department spotted a vehicle believed to be connected to an armed robbery in Beverly Hills, leading to a high-octane chase that blazed through the streets.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The suspect recklessly evaded police, speeding through red lights at over 60 mph and driving on the wrong side of the road during rush-hour traffic. During the chase, the suspect livestreamed himself evading the police, while a woman in the background pleaded with him to let her and their baby out of the car. However, it was not until much later that they were able to exit the car safely.</p>

<p>The pursuit concluded at a dead end in a Blair Hills neighbourhood. Deputies quickly secured the area, leading to a standoff, according to <em>KTLA.</em>&nbsp;He exited the car with the baby while a woman exited the rear passenger seat. He then hugged and kissed his girlfriend before ultimately surrendering to the authorities.</p>

<p>The suspect allegedly carjacked his girlfriend's car, according to the Sheriff's Department.&nbsp;The deputies said they were shocked to discover that the suspect had led them on a dangerous chase with his child in the car.</p>

<p>''It's crazy to think that not only is this guy driving like a madman, not only does he have his 2-month-old daughter in the car and his child's mother, but he's taking the time to get on his phone and livestream the whole thing. It goes beyond words when you meet an individual like that,'' Deputy Tony Lomedico said at a press conference.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Following the arrest, the suspect was identified as 21-year-old Daiyaan Henderson. He faces multiple charges, including carjacking and kidnapping&nbsp;in addition to armed robbery and being a felon in possession of a firearm, according to the sheriff's department. Although the woman in the car was found to be the mother of his child and was not arrested, she was determined to be a victim in the incident.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

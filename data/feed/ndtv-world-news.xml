       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The number of fires in Brazil's Amazon rainforest region for the month of August surged to the highest level since 2010, government data showed on Sunday, after a record drought that has been plaguing the biome.</p>

<p>Last year's rains came late and were weaker than usual because a weather pattern, known as El Nino, was supercharged by climate change, leaving the rainforest especially vulnerable to this year's fires.</p>

<p>Satellites detected 38,266 fire hotspots in the Amazon in August, more than double compared to the previous year and the largest number for that month since 2010, data from Brazil's National Institute for Space Research (Inpe) showed.</p>

<p>The August data reaching a 14-year high comes after last month's fire hotspots in the region surged to a two-decade high.</p>

<p>While the data is the fastest indicator of the state of fires in the region, which often peak between August and September, it does not indicate the intensity.</p>

<p>Fires in the naturally wet and humid biome often start on cattle ranches where locals are converting the jungle into pastures for cattle ranching.</p>

<p>Warmer air and drier vegetation have created conditions where fires can spread more rapidly as well as burn more intensely and for longer. Deforestation has also reduced the rainforest's ability to produce rain and humidity.</p>

<p>Helga Correa, a conservation specialist at WWF-Brasil, said in an initial assessment of the August data last week that the fires were driven by a combination of weather, climate change and human actions.</p>

<p>"The region where we detected concentrated smoke in August coincides with the so-called Arch of Deforestation, which includes the north of Rondonia, the south of Amazonas and the southwest of Para," she said.</p>

<p>"This indicates that, in addition to climate change and El Nino, changes in land use produced by humans play a central role in the increase in fires," she said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iran's final investigation into the May helicopter crash that killed president Ebrahim Raisi has found it was caused by bad weather, the body investigating the case said Sunday.</p>

<p>The helicopter carrying 63-year-old Raisi and his entourage came down on a fog-shrouded mountainside in northern Iran, killing the president and seven others, and triggering snap elections.</p>

<p>The main cause of the helicopter crash was the "complex climatic and atmospheric conditions of the region in the spring", the special board investigating the dimensions and causes of the helicopter accident said, according to state broadcaster IRIB.</p>

<p>The report added that "the sudden emergence of a thick mass of dense and rising fog" caused the helicopter's collision into the mountain.</p>

<p>Iran's army in May similarly said it had found no evidence of criminal activity in the crash that also killed Raisi's foreign minister, Hossein Amir-Abdollahian.</p>

<p>In August, Fars news agency cited the main causes of the May 19 crash as bad weather conditions and the helicopter's inability to ascend with two extra passengers against security protocols.</p>

<p>But the Iranian armed forces were quick to reject the finding saying, "what is mentioned on Fars news about the presence of two people in the helicopter against the security protocols... is completely false".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The head of Israel's powerful Histadrut trade union ordered a "complete strike" in support of Gaza hostages on Monday and urged a deal to secure their release after the bodies of six captives were recovered.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel's main union on Sunday ordered a nationwide general strike after soldiers recovered the bodies of six dead hostages from the Gaza Strip where the military is battling Palestinian operatives.</p>

<p>The remains of the six were recovered Saturday "from an underground tunnel in the Rafah area" in southern Gaza, the military said.</p>

<p>They were among 251 hostages seized during Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel that triggered the ongoing war, 97 of whom remain captive in Gaza including 33 the army says are dead.</p>

<p>Scores were released during a negotiated one-week truce in November, but relatives of those still held believe not enough is being done to free them.</p>

<p>Campaign group the Hostages and Missing Families Forum said a negotiated "deal for the return of the hostages" was urgently needed.</p>

<p>"Were it not for the delays, sabotage and excuses" in months of mediation efforts, the six hostages "would likely still be alive", a statement said.</p>

<p>The families called for a nationwide general strike to force the government to reach a deal to secure the release of the remaining captives.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards, the head of Israel's powerful Histadrut trade union ordered a "complete strike" for Monday in support of the hostages.</p>

<h3><strong>'Complete strike'</strong></h3>

<p>"I have come to the conclusion that only our intervention can shake those who need to be shaken," Histadrut chairman Arnon bar David said in a statement.</p>

<p>"Starting tomorrow at six in the morning, the entire Israeli economy will go on complete strike."</p>

<p>"A deal is not progressing due to political considerations and this is unacceptable."</p>

<p>The six hostages were named as Carmel Gat, taken from a kibbutz community near the Gaza border, and Eden Yerushalmi, Almog Sarusi, Ori Danino, US-Israeli Hersh Goldberg-Polin and Russian-Israeli Alexander Lobanov -- all seized by Palestinian operatives from a music festival site.</p>

<p>Military spokesman Daniel Hagari said all six "were abducted alive on the morning of October 7" and "brutally murdered by Hamas terrorists shortly before we reached them".</p>

<p>Qatar-based Hamas official Izzat al-Rishq said the six were "killed by Zionist (Israeli) bombing", an accusation the military denied.</p>

<p>A senior Hamas official told AFP on condition of anonymity that "some" of the six had been "approved" for release in a potential hostage-prisoner swap as part of a deal yet to be agreed.</p>

<p>Critics in Israel have accused Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of prolonging the war for political gain.</p>

<p>Netanyahu told Lobanov's parents on Sunday: "I would like to tell you how much I regret and request forgiveness for not succeeding in bringing Sasha back alive."</p>

<p>He blamed Hamas leaders "who kill hostages and do not want an agreement", vowing to "settle the score" with them.</p>

<h3><strong>West Bank attack</strong></h3>

<p>US President Joe Biden said he was "devastated and outraged" by their deaths, but told reporters he was "still optimistic" a truce and hostage release deal could be reached.</p>

<p>The Biden administration has been involved in ceasefire mediation efforts along with Qatar and Egypt.</p>

<p>In the occupied West Bank, as soldiers pressed day five of coordinated raids targeting Palestinian operatives, Israeli police said a "shooting attack" killed three officers.</p>

<p>The attack near Hebron added to surging violence in the territory where at least 24 Palestinians, including 14 operative groups said were their members, have been killed by the military since the Israeli raids began on Wednesday.</p>

<p>One 20-year-old soldier was killed Saturday in the raids, which Israel's military has called "counter-terrorism" operations.</p>

<p>On Sunday, a "shooting attack" near the Tarqumiya checkpoint in the Hebron area in the southern West Bank killed three police officers.</p>

<p>The military said it "eliminated" the suspected attacker after surrounding a house in Hebron.</p>

<p>In the northern West Bank, an AFP photographer saw Israeli bulldozers in Jenin city centre, a day after an official said soldiers had destroyed most of the streets and power and water had been cut off in the adjacent refugee camp.</p>

<p>Later on Sunday an AFP photographer heard loud explosions near the camp and saw black smoke over the city.</p>

<p>The United Nations said Wednesday that at least 637 Palestinians had been killed in the territory by Israeli troops or settlers since the Gaza war began.</p>

<p>Twenty-three Israelis, including soldiers, have been killed in Palestinian attacks or during army operations over the same period, according to official figures.</p>

<h3><strong>Polio vaccinations</strong></h3>

<p>In the besieged Gaza Strip, "humanitarian pauses" in the nearly 11-month war between Israel and Hamas were due to take place to facilitate a massive polio vaccination drive which a health official told AFP had begun in earnest Sunday.</p>

<p>Hamas's October 7 attack resulted in the deaths of 1,205 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures.</p>

<p>Israel's offensive has killed at least 40,738 people in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry. The UN rights office says most of the dead are women and children.</p>

<p>The fighting has devastated Gaza, repeatedly displaced most of its 2.4 million people and triggered a humanitarian crisis. Water, sanitation and medical facilities have been ravaged, contributing to the spread of preventable disease.</p>

<p>The World Health Organization has said Israel agreed to a series of three-day "humanitarian pauses" to facilitate the vaccination campaign that aims to reach some 640,000 children, after the first confirmed case in Gaza in 25 years.</p>

<p>On Sunday, it was formally launched at three health centres in central Gaza, said Yasser Shaaban, director of Al-Awda hospital.</p>

<p>"We hope this vaccination campaign for children will be calm," said Shaaban, noting there were "a lot of drones" flying overhead.</p>

<p>Louise Wateridge, a spokeswoman for the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, later said nearly 2,000 children were vaccinated initially Sunday.</p>

<p>But she added that they were anxious about later: "If the bombing continues after 2:00 pm this is of course going to impact the vaccination campaign... The only way to do this is a ceasefire."</p>

<p>On Sunday, rescuers in the Gaza Strip said 10 people had been killed in Israeli bombardment and an air strike.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Even in the UK's most Conservative constituency, the former governing party's contest to choose a new leader is failing to set pulses racing.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Even in the UK's most Conservative constituency, the former governing party's contest to choose a new leader is failing to set pulses racing.</p>

<p>Six former ministers have jostled for the past month to succeed ex-Prime Minister Rishi Sunak at the helm of the Tory Party. But with their battle confined largely to closed-door hustings among party faithful and op-eds in the national press, voters in Harrow East - where more than 53% of those who turned out at the general election on July 4 voted Conservative - showed little enthusiasm for the proceedings when approached by Bloomberg.</p>

<p>"I don't think the Tories will win again," said Patricia Tubbritt, a pensioner who was en route to the supermarket with a trolley bag in tow. After abandoning the Conservatives last month in favour of Reform UK, an insurgent party to its right, she professed herself uninspired by the six candidates and spoke of her nostalgia for former premier Boris Johnson, who was ousted in 2022 by his own party after a series of scandals, and no longer sits in Parliament. "He's the only chance of good leadership," she said.</p>

<p>The views in Harrow underscore the challenge facing whichever contender emerges victorious on Nov. 2. Their task is to rebuild Britain's self-styled natural party of government from the ruins of its worst-ever defeat and make it electable once more. And they have to achieve that when even voters in their most loyal constituency aren't certain they've got the right diagnosis of the country's ills.</p>

<p>"Why would voters care? The Tories were pummeled in the election," said Rob Ford, a professor of political science at the University of Manchester. "When you are the opposition, it is a daily struggle to get people to pay attention to you at all."&nbsp;</p>

<p>The bookmakers' favourite is former Business Secretary Kemi Badenoch, who's been joined in the starting line-up by former Foreign Secretary James Cleverly, ex-Home Office Minister Robert Jenrick, Priti Patel - a former Home Secretary, Mel Stride, who held the work and pensions brief under Sunak, and former Security Minister Tom Tugendhat.</p>

<p>But in Harrow East, the contest has failed to invigorate the sort of voters the Tories must win back nationwide to rebuild their fortunes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dotted with retirement villages, Hindu temples, farms, and a generous helping of curry houses, the leafy district at the end of the London Underground's Jubilee Line was the only constituency in the country where more than 50% of votes cast last month went to the Tories.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Of 25 people interviewed by Bloomberg in Harrow, including eight who voted Tory on July 4 and 10 who said they'd previously opted for the party, just one signalled any interest in the outcome of the leadership race, saying they favoured Tugendhat. The others either declined to pick a favourite candidate or saw little prospect in any winner reviving a party that led successive UK governments for the past 14 years and for more than 60 years over the past century.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="ins_instory_dv_caption">Kemi Badenoch is the bookmakers' favourite to win the Conservative Party leadership contest.</p>
</div>

<p>One - who like all eight Tory voters asked not to be named airing their political views - said they didn't think any of the candidates had what it takes. Another, who was tending to some greenery near Harrow East's Conservative Association, likened the Tories to a boat without oars. A woman who described herself as a lifelong Conservative said she didn't think the party would ever win the keys to 10 Downing Street again.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Those sentiments reflect the scale of rebuilding required by the Tories, who won just 121 of the 650 seats in the House of Commons on July 4 - eclipsing previous nadirs of 156 in 1906 and 165 in the Tony Blair landslide in 1997.</p>

<p>The leadership contest is about to step up a gear, with launch speeches expected from Badenoch, Cleverly and Tugendhat this week after Patel delivered hers on Friday. Tory MPs will whittle the candidates down to four before the party's annual conference this month and then to two, who will go to a wider vote among grassroots members.</p>

<p>The winner must choose whether to pivot right to win back voters who defected to the populist anti-immigration Reform UK party led by Nigel Farage, or toe a more moderate line to appeal to the 46% of UK voters who opted for Liberal Democrat or Labour on July 4.</p>

<p>That tug of war could be summed up in the views of two Harrow voters: The Tugendhat supporter, who described the former security minister as the only viable option because of his centrist views, and Jenny Lawrence, a lifelong Conservative in her 50s who switched to Reform this year, calling Farage's outfit "the only alternative." The Tories, she said, have no future if they continue to fail to match their actions to their rhetoric.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="ins_instory_dv_caption">Tom Tugendhat is one of six former ministers vying to become leader of the Conservative Party.</p>
</div>

<p>It's not just those who switched parties who the Tories must win back by the next election, but also those who didn't vote. Turnout was the lowest in almost a quarter of a century, at 59.8%, as voters who didn't think the Conservatives deserved another term, but were uninspired by Labour, switched off.&nbsp;</p>

<p>James Baxter, a 76-year-old former airline worker, said he considers himself a Conservative, but this year, stayed at home on election day. "I was uninspired," he explained. "I don't think any of them know what they're talking about."</p>

<p>Harrow East was successfully defended by Bob Blackman - &nbsp;a Tory who's represented the area since 2010. He took the highest vote share of any Conservative, and his 11,680 majority is the party's third safest, bettered only by Sunak in Richmond and Northallerton and former City Minister Andrew Griffith in Arundel and South Downs.</p>

<p>Blackman's campaign manager, Matthew Goodwin-Freeman, sees the opportunity for the next Tory leader in the nature of this July's election. That's because Keir Starmer's Labour Party took just 33.7% of the vote while sweeping to a huge win in terms of seats.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"In five years' time when we have the general election, the whole 'I'm fed up with the Conservatives' will be over because they won't have been in power," Goodwin-Freeman said. "Don't think this is a decade of Labour by any stretch of the imagination."</p>

<p>Starmer's Labour showed what is possible in modern British politics by sweeping to a huge victory just five years after sinking to its worst defeat since the 1930s.</p>

<p>"If the Tories get back on the pitch, those big swings are possible," said the University of Manchester's Ford. "These are volatile political times."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel announced Sunday its troops had found six dead hostages in a Gaza tunnel, as Israeli police said a "shooting attack" in the occupied West Bank killed three officers.</p>

<p>The deadly shooting near Hebron added to surging violence in the West Bank, which is separated from Gaza by Israeli territory and where Israel has since Wednesday carried out a large-scale military operation that has sparked international concern.</p>

<p>In the besieged Gaza Strip, "humanitarian pauses" in the nearly 11-month war between Israel and Hamas were set to take place to facilitate a massive polio vaccination drive which a health official told AFP had begun.</p>

<p>Israel's military said the remains of six hostages were recovered Saturday "from an underground tunnel in the Rafah area" in southern Gaza and formally identified in Israel.</p>

<p>The were named as Carmel Gat, who was taken from a kibbutz community near the Gaza border, as well as Eden Yerushalmi, Almog Sarusi, Ori Danino, US-Israeli Hersh Goldberg-Polin and Russian-Israeli Alexander Lobanov, who were seized by Palestinian operatives from a music festival site.</p>

<p>Military spokesman Daniel Hagari said all six "were abducted alive on the morning of October 7" and "brutally murdered by Hamas terrorists shortly before we reached them".</p>

<p>US President Joe Biden said he was "devastated and outraged" by their deaths, but told reporters he was "still optimistic" a Gaza truce and hostage release deal can be reached.</p>

<p>"It's time this war ended," said Biden, whose administration has been involved in ceasefire mediation efforts along with Qatar and Egypt.</p>

<p>EU top diplomat Josep Borrell said he was "horrified at the murder" of the hostages, and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer expressed shock at their "senseless" killing.</p>

<p>The six were among 251 hostages seized during Hamas's October 7 attack that triggered the ongoing war, 97 of whom remain captive in Gaza including 33 the army says are dead. Scores were released during a negotiated one-week truce in November.</p>

<p>Campaign group the Hostages and Missing Families Forum said a negotiated "deal for the return of the hostages" was urgently needed.</p>

<p>"Were it not for the delays, sabotage and excuses" in months of mediation efforts, the six hostages "would likely still be alive".</p>

<p>The families called for a nationwide general strike from Sunday night to force the government to reach a deal to secure the release of those still held.</p>

<p>A senior Hamas official told AFP on condition of anonymity that "some" of the six had been "approved" for release in a potential hostage-prisoner swap as part of a deal yet to be agreed.</p>

<h3><strong>'Request forgiveness'</strong></h3>

<p>Critics in Israel have accused Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of prolonging the war for political gain.</p>

<p>Speaking to Lobanov's parents on Sunday, Netanyahu said: "I would like to tell you how much I regret and request forgiveness for not succeeding in bringing Sasha back alive."</p>

<p>Qatar-based Hamas official Izzat al-Rishq said the six were "killed by Zionist (Israeli) bombing", an accusation the military denied.</p>

<p>Netanyahu blamed Hamas leaders "who kill hostages and do not want an agreement", vowing to "settle the score" with them.</p>

<p>Hamas's October 7 attack resulted in the deaths of 1,205 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures.</p>

<p>The fighting has devastated Gaza, repeatedly displaced most of its 2.4 million people and triggered a humanitarian crisis. Water, sanitation and medical facilities have been ravaged, contributing to the spread of preventable disease.</p>

<p>After the first confirmed polio case in 25 years, a Gaza health official said vaccinations began Saturday ahead of a wider campaign.</p>

<p>The World Health Organization has said Israel agreed to a series of three-day "humanitarian pauses" to facilitate the campaign that aims to reach some 640,000 children.</p>

<p>But she added that they were anxious about later: "If the bombing continues after 2:00 pm this is of course going to impact the vaccination campaign... The only way to do this is a ceasefire."</p>

<p>Wateridge later reported a strike in the Nuseirat area.</p>

<p>The civil defence agency said an Israeli air strike killed two people in Gaza City further north, where an AFP correspondent also reported shelling early Sunday.</p>

<h3><strong>West Bank violence</strong></h3>

<p>Israeli forces and Palestinian operatives were battling in the West Bank Sunday, five days into major coordinated raids Israel's military has described as "counter-terrorism" operations.</p>

<p>A "shooting attack" near Tarqumiya checkpoint in the Hebron area in the southern West Bank killed three people on Sunday, Israel's emergency medical service said. The police said they were all members of the force.</p>

<p>The military said several assailants may have been involved.</p>

<p>In the northern West Bank, an AFP photographer saw Israeli bulldozers in Jenin's city centre, a day after a local official said soldiers had destroyed most of the streets and power and water had been cut off in the adjacent refugee camp.</p>

<p>At least 22 Palestinians, including 14 claimed by operative groups, have been killed by the Israeli military since the start on Wednesday of simultaneous raids across the northern West Bank.</p>

<p>A 20-year-old soldier was killed Saturday.</p>

<p>The United Nations said Wednesday that at least 637 Palestinians had been killed in the territory by Israeli troops or settlers since the Gaza war began.</p>

<p>Twenty-three Israelis, including soldiers, have been killed in Palestinian attacks or during army operations over the same period, according to official figures.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Amid growing concerns over the new strain of mpox virus, Pakistan's Peshawar city has started emerging as the 'epicentre' of the virus, as the fifth mpox case was recorded on Sunday, Geo News reported.</p>

<p>The latest patient, a 47-year-old man, tested positive after being isolated by Border Health Services staff on August 29. He had returned from the Gulf region. This has also raised concerns about the virus's spread from travellers arriving from the Middle East.</p>

<p>"This is the fifth mpox case reported this year [in the country] and the fourth since WHO declared mpox a global health emergency," said Federal Director General of Health Dr Shabana Saleem on Sunday.</p>

<p>"The virus's re-emergence in Peshawar raises serious concerns about its transmission and demands immediate action."</p>

<p>Saleem also expressed the need for vigilance and highlighted that all recent cases have involved individuals with a history of travel to the Gulf.</p>

<p>"Peshawar appears to be turning into an epicentre for mpox cases," she stated. "This trend is alarming, and we are doubling our efforts to prevent further spread."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, authorities have ramped up measures to contain the virus, with stringent screening protocols now enforced at all airports, as reported by Geo News.</p>

<p>"We are not taking any chances. Effective screening systems are operational across the country," Saleem assured, noting the government's commitment to safeguarding public health.</p>

<p>Federal and provincial health officials are also coordinating closely to monitor the situation, ensuring that all necessary steps are taken swiftly.</p>

<p>"We are working round the clock to ensure all preventive measures are in place and effective," the Federal Director General of Health added. "The Ministry of Health is continuously monitoring the situation, and we are prepared to respond to any developments immediately.</p>

<p>The rise in mpox cases in Peshawar has triggered concerns among health experts and the public alike. There have been calls for increased awareness and stricter travel guidelines, according to Geo News.</p>

<p>The federal director general of health urged the public to remain vigilant and to comply with health advisories, particularly those returning from high-risk regions.</p>

<p>"Public cooperation is crucial in preventing the spread of mpox," she warned. "Together, we can curb this virus before it takes a firmer hold."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Calling Brazilian Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes "a fake judge", tech billionaire Elon Musk on Sunday said that evidence is growing to show that he deliberately interfered in the country's election held last year.</p>

<p>Musk said this after de Moraes ordered to block Musk's social media platform X nationwide, following the company's refusal to appoint a legal representative in the country.</p>

<p>"There is growing evidence that fake judge Alexandre engaged in serious, repeated, and deliberate election interference in Brazil's last presidential election," Musk said in a post on X.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">There is growing evidence that fake judge <a href="https://twitter.com/alexandre?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Alexandre</a> engaged in serious, repeated &amp; deliberate election interference in Brazil's last presidential election.<br />

— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1830091917654168032?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 1, 2024</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>He said that former Twitter employees helped him. He also called out people to share examples.</p>

<p>"Under Brazilian law, that would mean up to 20 years in prison. And, I'm sorry to say that it appears that some former Twitter employees were complicit in helping him do so. Anyone with examples or evidence to this effect, please reply to this post," Musk said.</p>

<p>Brazil is one of the biggest markets for X, with reportedly more than 22 million users.</p>

<p>The platform has been in conflict with de Moraes for months over the platform's refusal to comply with court orders to remove profiles that promote coup-related content or undermine democracy, according to Xinhua news agency.</p>

<p>Musk also cautioned investors from investing in the country. On Saturday he said: "The oppressive regime in Brazil is so afraid of the people learning the truth that they will bankrupt anyone who tries".</p>

<p>The Brazilian Supreme Federal Court has also ordered X to pay fines amounting to 18 million reais (about $3.2 million) for non-compliance.</p>

<p>As per De Moraes, X has facilitated "the actions of extremist groups and digital militias". The SC judge said that the platform is "enabling the spread of Nazi, racist, fascist, hateful, and anti-democratic speech", particularly ahead of the upcoming elections.</p>

<p>De Moraes has also instructed the country's National Telecommunications Agency (Anatel) to block access to X within 24 hours. The Brazilian judge also gave Apple and Google five days to remove the X app from their online stores.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rescuers on Sunday said they had found 17 bodies after a helicopter crashed with 22 people aboard in Russia's Kamchatka peninsula in the far east.</p>

<p>The helicopter went missing shortly after takeoff Saturday carrying 19 tourists and 3 crew, regional authorities said.</p>

<p>Kamchatka is a picturesque, wild region popular for adventure tourism due to its active volcanoes and pristine nature.</p>

<p>Rescuers spotted the remains of the helicopter on Sunday morning in a hilly area at a height of 900 metres, Kamchatka Governor Vladimir Solodov said in a video posted on Telegram.</p>

<p>Aerial video footage posted by Russia's emergency situations ministry showed helicopter debris lying on a slope close to the top of a large wooded hill.</p>

<p>The ministry said the aircraft was found close to the location where it went off the radar.</p>

<p>A ministry official, Ivan Lemikhov, said: "At this moment we have already found 17 bodies."</p>

<p>"The rescuers have set up camp and the search has halted until daybreak," he added.</p>

<p>The Mi-8 is a Soviet-designed military helicopter that is widely used for transport in Russia.</p>

<p>The helicopter that crashed was operated by a Kamchatka-based company called Vityaz-aero that organises flights for tourists, according to the emergencies ministry.</p>

<p>Accidents involving planes and helicopters are very frequent in Russia's far eastern region, which is sparsely populated and where many areas are only accessible by helicopter.</p>

<p>In August 2021, a Mi-8 helicopter with 16 people on board including 13 tourists crashed into a lake in Kamchatka due to poor visibility, killing eight.</p>

<p>In July the same year, a plane crashed as it came in to land on the peninsula, with 22 passengers and six crew aboard, all of whom were killed.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed on Sunday to "settle the score" with Hamas after the military had recovered the bodies of six hostages from a Gaza tunnel.</p>

<p>"Those who kill hostages do not want an agreement" for a Gaza truce, Netanyahu said in a statement, telling Hamas leaders that "we will hunt you down, we will catch you and we will settle the score".</p>

<p>Netanyahu said that Israel was "fighting on all fronts against a cruel enemy who wants to murder us all", mentioning a shooting attack near the city of Hebron in the occupied West Bank earlier on Sunday that killed three police officers.</p>

<p>Hamas has not claimed the attack but in a statement called it a "heroic operation by the resistance".</p>

<p>According to Netanyahu, "the fact that Hamas continues to commit atrocities such as those it committed on October 7 obliges us to do everything we can to ensure that it can no longer do so", referring to the Palestinian group's unprecedented attack on southern Israel that triggered the ongoing war in the Gaza Strip.</p>

<p>A senior Hamas official said that several of the six hostages found dead had been "approved" for release in the event of a truce deal, which has yet to be finalised despite months of mediation efforts.</p>

<p>"Some of the names of the captives announced as found by the (Israeli) occupier... were part of the list of hostages to be released that Hamas had approved" in a proposed exchange for Palestinian prisoners held in Israel, the official told AFP on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to speak publicly on the issue.</p>

<p>Israeli media reported that US-Israeli hostage Hersh Goldberg-Polin and two others whose bodies had been recovered from Gaza -- Carmel Gat and Eden Yerushalmi -- had been approved by Hamas to be released in the event of a truce deal.</p>

<p>The Hamas official said the six captives were "killed by the occupation's fire and bombing", an accusation denied by the Israeli military.</p>

<p>Military spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Nadav Shoshani in an online briefing with journalists that "according to our initial assessment, they were brutally murdered by Hamas terrorists".</p>

<p>"We do know they were murdered by Hamas terrorists. We do know -- I can tell you -- there was no real-time fire engagement in the tunnel," Shoshani said.</p>

<p>Claims by Hamas that the hostages were killed by Israeli forces were "psychological warfare", he said.</p>

<p>The bodies were found in a tunnel in the southern city of Rafah, around one kilometre (0.6 miles) away from where troops had rescued alive another hostage, Kaid Farhan Alkadi, on Tuesday, according to Shoshani.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two east German states have begun casting votes today, with the far-right political party Alternative for Germany (AfD) poised to win a state election for the first time. AfD's win would mark the first time a far-right party has the most seats in a German state parliament in nearly a century.</p>

<p>The ongoing foreign policy issues, including Russia's war with Ukraine, are playing a role in the state elections of Thuringia and Saxony.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Opinion polls have indicated that the AfD is ahead in Thuringia and a close second in Saxony. Another party, the far-left BSW, is also getting a strong upstart, the opinion polls showed.</p>

<p>The elections come just over a week after three people were stabbed to death in a suspected Islamist attack in the city of Solingen, sparking anti-immigration sentiment in Germany.</p>

<p>"Our freedoms are being increasingly restricted because people are being allowed into the country who don't fit in," the AfD's leader in Thuringia, Bjoern Hoecke, said, as per Reuters.</p>

<p>Both AfD and BSW, which are critical of the European Union and have an anti-immigration stance, have a stronghold in the former Communist-run East Germany. The two parties have also voiced criticism for the current government in Germany and the military aid it gives to Ukraine.</p>

<p>In both states, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz's party, Social Democrats, are polling at around 6 per cent, while their coalition partners, the Greens and the liberal FDP, lag further behind.</p>

<h3><strong>Rise of the far-right</strong></h3>

<p>AfD was created in 2013 as an anti-euro group before it became an anti-immigration party.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the European Union Parliament elections that took place in June, the party scored a record 15.9 per cent overall.</p>

<p>The Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance (BSW) was created in January this year after she quit Die Linke. Like AfD, Ms Wagenknecht and her party have a supportive stance towards Russia. BSW garnered around 6 per cent of the German vote in June's EU Parliament elections. The party is expected to win up to 12-20 per cent in today's polling, potentially putting it in a kingmaker position in both states.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I especially like her stance on the Ukraine war, we can't simply keep delivering weapons," BSW supporter Carola Gustavus said as per Reuters. "One has to negotiate even with the worst opponent," she added.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli-American hostage Hersh Goldberg-Polin was announced dead early Sunday morning by Israeli authorities. The 23-year-old was kidnapped by Hamas militants during the October 7 attack on southern Israel.</p>

<p>Despite hopes for his safe return, his body was recovered on Saturday in the tunnels under Rafah, along with five other hostages.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">“With broken hearts, the Goldberg-Polin family is devastated to announce the death of their beloved son and brother, Hersh. The family thanks you all for your love and support and asks for privacy at this time.” <a href="https://t.co/sof97ktOf2">pic.twitter.com/sof97ktOf2</a></p>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p><strong>Who was Hersh Goldberg-Polin?</strong></p>

<p>Hersh Goldberg-Polin was born in Oakland, California, and immigrated to Israel with his family in 2008 at the age of seven.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Being an Israeli-American, he held dual citizenship.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He was described as a "happy-go-lucky" individual, with a deep passion for geography and travel, interests that were evident from his childhood. His bedroom was filled with atlases, globes, and National Geographic magazines. Before his abduction, Mr Goldberg-Polin had planned to embark on a round-the-world trip in December 2023, a dream that was tragically cut short by the events at the Nova music festival.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hersh Goldberg-Polin was kidnapped during Hamas' attack on the Nova music festival in southern Israel on October 7, 2023. He was among the hundreds of young festival-goers who were taken hostage during the surprise attack, which resulted in over 1,200 deaths. Mr Goldberg-Polin and his friends initially sought refuge in a bomb shelter, where he bravely attempted to throw back grenades lobbed by Hamas militants, ultimately losing his left arm from the elbow down in the process.</p>

<p>His parents, Jon Polin and Rachel Goldberg-Polin, were among the most vocal advocates for the release of hostages, including their son. They regularly met with top US officials and publicly urged the Israeli government to negotiate a deal for the hostages' release.</p>

<p>Hersh Goldberg-Polin was announced dead on September 1, after nearly a year in captivity. His body was found in Hamas-run tunnels under the city of Rafah, and it was reported that they were killed shortly before Israeli troops reached them.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>More than 60 people were battling heavy winds and rains on Sunday searching for a Russian helicopter that went missing the day before with 22 aboard in the far eastern peninsula of Kamchatka, the emergencies ministry said.</p>

<p>Seven groups of emergency rescuers, rangers and volunteers were dispatched to try to locate the Mi-8T helicopter that took off from a base near the Vachkazhets volcano, the ministry said on the Telegram messaging app.</p>

<p>The Kamchatka Peninsula, some 7,100 km (4,400 miles) east of Moscow, has been hit by a cyclone over the weekend, with rain expected to ease slightly only towards the end of Sunday, the ministry and the region's meteorology services said on Telegram.</p>

<p>"The search has not yielded any results so far," Russia's RIA state news agency reported, citing Sergei Lebedev, the emergency minister for the Kamchatka region.</p>

<p>"The road is extremely difficult. It is possible to move by foot only."</p>

<p>The photographer revealed some interesting facts about the picture in a post on Instagram.&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>Image Size: 708 GB</li>
	<li>Images Stacked: Over 81,000</li>
	<li>Composition: Merging of four different Moon phases and shadow areas to reveal detailed topography</li>
	<li>Telescope Used: Skywatcher Flextube 250p Dobsonian modified on an Equatorial Mount NEQ 6pro</li>
	<li>Cameras Used: Canon EOS 1200D (for minerals), ZWO ASI 178mc (for details)</li>
	<li>AI Involvement: None</li>
	<li>Image Resolution: 159.7 megapixels</li>
	<li>Visual Representation: Depicts the Moon as a flat disk with detailed topography</li>
</ul>

<p>The photo was posted on Reddit, where it sparked a lively discussion among enthusiasts. One user questioned whether the colours in the image were representative of actual metals and minerals on the Moon. A user clarified that the colours in the image are not what the human eye would naturally perceive.<br />
"The saturation has been increased to highlight geological differences on the lunar surface," they explained. "The reddish areas indicate high iron and feldspar content, while the blue-tinted zones have higher titanium content. Instead of viewing the colours as 'real' or 'fake,' it's more accurate to consider them as a tool that simulates what one might see with enhanced detection capabilities."</p>

<p>Another user explained simply, urging us to think like "someone who is colour-blind". Colour-blind people can't see certain colours, like red and green. To them, these colours might appear as shades of grey or be so muted that they look the same. The colours are there, but they can't see them because their eyes aren't sensitive enough. Similarly, the colours in Darya Mirza's Moon photograph are real, but our eyes might not be sensitive enough to pick them out in their natural state. The enhancements in the photo make these colours more visible.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yemen's Iran-backed Houthi rebels said Saturday they had attacked a merchant ship in the Gulf of Aden, as a multinational naval force said two missiles exploded near a Liberia-flagged vessel.</p>

<p>"The Yemeni Armed Forces carried out a military operation targeting the ship (GROTON) in the Gulf of Aden," Houthi spokesman Yahya Saree said in a televised statement.</p>

<p>He said the ship had been hit and that it was the second time it had been attacked after a similar incident on August 3.</p>

<p>The Yemeni rebels have waged a campaign against international shipping passing through the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden that they say is in solidarity with Palestinians amid the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip.</p>

<p>Earlier on Saturday, the Joint Maritime Information Centre (JMIC), run by a Western naval coalition, reported that the Groton had been targeted by two ballistic missiles when it was 130 nautical miles east of Aden.</p>

<p>The United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) agency, run by Britain's Royal Navy, said the captain reported that all crew were safe and the Groton was "proceeding to next port of call".</p>

<p>The Houthi attacks, targeting ships that they say are linked to Israel, have disrupted traffic in a maritime zone that is vital to global trade.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the US Central Command said Saturday that US forces destroyed a Houthi drone and an uncrewed surface vessel in rebel-controlled areas of Yemen over the past 24 hours.</p>

<p>"It was determined these systems presented a clear and imminent threat to US and coalition forces," CENTCOM said in a statement on X.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russia said Sunday that it had thwarted a "massive" Ukrainian drone attack by downing 158 drones across 15 regions, including two over the capital Moscow.</p>

<p>A coal-fired power plant near the city was reported hit, as was an oil refinery within the city boundaries.</p>

<p>Russia's defence ministry said most of the drones -- 122 -- were downed over the regions of Kursk, Bryansk, Voronezh and Belgorod which border Ukraine.</p>

<p>"Our defenders are repelling an attempted massive UAV attack on the territory of the Bryansk region," regional governor Aleksandr Bogomaz said.</p>

<p>The barrage comes just days after Ukraine's energy infrastructure was targeted by over 200 Russian drones and missiles in one of the biggest such attacks.</p>

<p>It is also nearly a month since Ukraine went on the offensive in Russia's Kursk region, even as Russian troops continue their steady advance in eastern Ukraine.</p>

<p>Both sides have targeted energy infrastructure since Russia began its campaign in Ukraine in February 2022.</p>

<p>A local official in the Moscow region said three drones had tried to hit the Kashira coal-fired power station.</p>

<p>"There were no victims nor damages," he said, adding that electricity was still reaching clients "correctly".</p>

<p>Russian news agencies also reported a fire at the Moscow oil refinery in Kapotnya, though mayor Sergei Sobyanin said there was "no damage or casualties".</p>

<p>In the Belgorod region, governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said: "The glass of three residential buildings in Belgorod is damaged. In one private residence, a utility building was completely destroyed."</p>

<p>On Wednesday, Ukrainian drones struck two fuel depots, setting them ablaze in southwest Russia's Rostov region and the northern Kirov region.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p data-qa="Component-Component" datatype="p">A shocking case of insurance fraud has sparked outrage online after a 42-year-old Shanghai woman, surnamed Xie, faked multiple miscarriages and forged medical documents to claim 66,200 yuan (Rs 7,83,841) in maternity insurance benefits. Notably, Xie is a high-earning employee at a foreign company with a monthly salary exceeding 30,000 yuan (Rs 3,55,215). She studied telecommunications and computer science at the university,&nbsp;reported the<em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scmp.com/news/people-culture/trending-china/article/3276484/china-woman-fakes-miscarriages-claim-us9300-insurance-cash-forged-medical-papers"> South China Morning Post.&nbsp;</a></em>Her actions have raised concerns about the maternity indemnity program, which is funded by employers to cover medical expenses and provide financial support during maternity leave.</p>

<p data-qa="Component-Component" datatype="p">During her maternity leave in December, Xie recalled her previous success in claiming insurance benefits after a genuine miscarriage two years prior. This inspired her deceitful plan, following which she leveraged her computer skills to fabricate false medical records. She created convincing documents, including a maternity certificate and discharge summary, falsely claiming hospitalisation for a miscarriage.</p>

<p data-qa="Component-Component" datatype="p">She then submitted two online insurance claims, accompanied by the forged papers, and received a total of 66,200 yuan in maternity benefits. To cover her tracks, she destroyed all related paper documents and digital records after each claim, attempting to erase any evidence of her fraudulent activities.</p>

<p data-qa="Component-Component" datatype="p">Earlier this year, she tried to fabricate another miscarriage report to claim over 40,000 yuan in maternity insurance benefits. However, her luck ran out as the claim was rejected. Interestingly, just a month later in February, Xie gave birth to her first child and applied for maternity benefits. But, during a routine document review, officials raised red flags upon discovering five maternity insurance claims filed by Xie within four years. The authorities reported the case to the police, leading Xie to surrender and return the entire amount of fraudulently obtained money.</p>

<p data-qa="Component-Component" datatype="p">She said, ''As an older pregnant woman with poor health, I worried about medical costs. In desperation, I impulsively faked miscarriages to get the insurance money. I have already resigned from my job and I deeply regret what I have done.''</p>

<p data-qa="Component-Component" datatype="p">Shanghai Prosecutor Gong Xiaoting said China's online insurance application system, designed for convenience, can be illegally exploited by criminals using photo-editing technology.</p>

<p data-qa="Component-Component" datatype="p">The court found Xie guilty of fraud and gave her a one -and-a-half-year suspended jail term on August 16.&nbsp;In his statement, Judge Wang Xinyuan said her actions not only violated her company's property rights but also posed a serious threat to the social insurance systems.&nbsp;</p>

<p data-qa="Component-Component" datatype="p">The insurance fraud sent shockwaves across mainland social media and sparked a heated debate about the need for strict measures to prevent similar cases in the future.&nbsp;</p>

<p data-qa="Component-Component" datatype="p">One user wrote, ''For about 60,000 yuan, she has ruined her life and her children's future,'' while another commented, ''Xie's monthly salary of 30,000 yuan is not low in China, yet she still resorted to fraud. It seems greed knows no bounds.''</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tens of thousands of people in Australia's southern island state of Tasmania were without power on Sunday after a cold front brought damaging winds and heavy rains, sparking flood warnings.</p>

<p>"Around 30,000 customers are without power across the state this morning," Tasnetworks, a state-owned power company, said on Facebook on Sunday.</p>

<p>The nation's weather forecaster said on its website that a cold front over Tasmania, population around 570,000 people, was moving away, "although bands of showers and thunderstorms continue to pose a risk of damaging wind gusts."</p>

<p>Properties, power lines and infrastructure had been damaged, Tasmania's emergency management minister Felix Ellis said in a televised media conference, adding that "the damage bill is likely to be significant".</p>

<p>Emergency authorities issued warnings for flooding, which they said could leave Tasmanians isolated for several days, as the state prepared for another cold front forecast to hit on Sunday night.</p>

<p>"There is potential for properties to be inundated, and roads may not be accessible," executive director of Tasmania State Emergency Service, Mick Lowe, said in a statement.</p>

<p>Authorities had received 330 requests for assistance in the last 24 hours, according to the agency.</p>

<p>Tasmania is a one-hour flight or 10-hour ferry crossing from the mainland city of Melbourne, 445 km (275 miles) away. About 40% of the island is wilderness or protected areas.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Judicial reforms championed by Mexico's outgoing president, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, and supported by his incoming successor have sparked diplomatic tensions with the United States and upset financial markets.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Judicial reforms championed by Mexico's outgoing president, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, and supported by his incoming successor have sparked diplomatic tensions with the United States and upset financial markets.</p>

<p>Here are the key points of the proposals, which will be debated in the ruling-party-dominated Congress, due to convene on Sunday:</p>

<h3><strong>What's the plan?&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Lopez Obrador wants the Supreme Court and other judges and magistrates to be elected by popular vote, arguing that the judiciary now serves the interests of the political and economic elite.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Candidates would be proposed by the executive, legislative and judicial branches of government.</p>

<p>At present, Supreme Court justices are nominated by the president and ratified by the Senate.</p>

<p>Judges and magistrates are appointed by the Federal Judicial Council, an administrative body.</p>

<p>The proposals, which are supported by president-elect Claudia Sheinbaum, who will take office on October 1, would reduce the number of Supreme Court judges from 11 to nine.</p>

<p>Their terms of office would be shortened from 15 years to 12.</p>

<p>A new body would be formed to supervise judges, in a country where the rate of impunity -- of being able to avoid accountability for crimes -- stands at 99 per cent, according to the non-governmental organization Impunidad Cero.</p>

<p>The system would have similarities to that of Bolivia, where members of the high courts are elected by popular vote.</p>

<p>Some states in the United States use elections to select judges. In Switzerland, judges are chosen by voters at the local level.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Why the controversy?</strong></h3>

<p>Opposition politicians, judges and judicial employees say that the reforms would politicize the justice system and compromise the separation of powers between the branches of government.</p>

<p>Margaret Satterthwaite, United Nations special rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, has also voiced "deep concerns" about the plan's "broad implications for judicial independence across Mexico."</p>

<p>"I urge the authorities to carefully reconsider the proposal, giving appropriate weight to the human rights guarantee of judicial independence," she wrote on social media platform X.</p>

<p>Human Rights Watch urged lawmakers to reject what it called the "dangerous proposals," saying they would "seriously undermine judicial independence and contravene international human rights standards."</p>

<p>The New York-based rights group expressed concern that the reforms would also eliminate restrictions on the military carrying out civilian law enforcement.</p>

<p>"Given Mexico's long history of serious human rights violations and official cover-ups, legislators should be taking steps to strengthen human rights protections, not weaken them," it said.</p>

<h3><strong>What's the diplomatic fallout?&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>US Ambassador to Mexico Ken Salazar has warned that the changes would "threaten" a trade relationship between the neighbouring countries that "relies on investors' confidence in Mexico's legal framework."</p>

<p>The reforms could pose "a major risk to the functioning of Mexico's democracy," he told journalists.</p>

<p>In particular, they could "make it easier for cartels and other bad actors to take advantage of politically motivated and inexperienced judges," Salazar said.</p>

<p>Canada, also a member of the major free trade partnership with the United States and Mexico, has for its part said investors are worried.</p>

<p>"They want stability, they want a judicial system that works if there are problems," Canadian Ambassador Graeme Clark said.</p>

<p>In response, Lopez Obrador announced a "pause" in relations with the US and Canadian embassies, criticizing the ambassadors' statements as "interventionist."</p>

<h3><strong>Why are markets nervous?&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Several investment firms have warned that curbing the independence of the judiciary would affect the resolution of conflicts between the government and the private sector.</p>

<p>The changes would "lead to heightened uncertainty" about the legal operating environment, British consultancy firm Capital Economics wrote in a note to clients.</p>

<p>"The politicization of the justice system could raise concerns about whether disputes between businesses and the government would be resolved in an impartial manner," it said.</p>

<p>Since Sheinbaum, a close ally of Lopez Obrador, won a landslide election victory on June 2, the Mexican peso has fallen by around 16 per cent against the dollar.</p>

<p>The drop reflects "concerns about the country's economic stability... and also the perception of risk that foreign investors are beginning to attribute to Mexico," Ramse Gutierrez, co-director of investments at asset manager Franklin Templeton, told AFP.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Israeli military announced today that it had discovered the bodies of six hostages in an underground tunnel in the southern Gaza Strip. Among the dead were dual citizens, including a US-Israeli and a Russian-Israeli. The Israeli military claimed that the hostages were brutally murdered by Hamas shortly before security forces could reach them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The hostages, whose identities have been confirmed as Carmel Gat, Eden Yerushalmi, Hersh Goldberg-Polin, Alexander Lobanov, Almog Sarusi, and Ori Danino, were kidnapped by Hamas militants during their brutal attack on southern Israel on October 7. The attack not only triggered the ongoing war but also led to the kidnapping of 251 individuals, of whom 97 remain captive, including 33 who the Israeli army believes are dead.</p>

<p>"A few hours ago, we informed the families that the bodies of their loved ones had been located by IDF troops in an underground tunnel in Rafah. According to our initial assessment, they were brutally murdered by Hamas terrorists shortly before we reached them," Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">This is a very difficult morning here in Israel.<br />
<br />
Carmel, Ori, Eden, Almog, Alex, Hersh.<br />
<br />
Murdered in cold blood by Hamas while in captivity.<br />
<br />
May their memory be a blessing. <a href="https://t.co/OAdZg8ZxB2">pic.twitter.com/OAdZg8ZxB2</a></p>
— Israel ישראל (@Israel) <a href="https://twitter.com/Israel/status/1830114580992844271?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 1, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p>The hostages were reportedly taken alive on October 7, and their bodies were discovered during combat operations in Rafah, approximately one kilometre from a tunnel where another hostage, Farhan Alkadi, had been rescued just days earlier. Hagari claimed that the IDF had been operating under extreme caution, knowing that additional hostages might be held in the area. However, they lacked precise information on the hostages' exact location.</p>

<p>The discovery of the bodies came amidst ongoing combat in Rafah, where IDF troops continued to engage with Hamas fighters.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"This morning, our hearts are broken alongside the families of Ori Danino, Alex Lobanov, Almog Sarusi, Hersh Goldberg-Polin, Carmel Gat, and Eden Yerushalmi," Hagari said. "It is impossible to put into words what the hostages have endured in Hamas captivity since October 7th, now 331 days, and what their families have been going through. This morning, this news shakes us all."</p>

<p>Among the six victims, Gat was abducted from the southern Israeli kibbutz community of Beeri and the others, aged between 23 and 32, taken from a music festival near the Gaza border.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

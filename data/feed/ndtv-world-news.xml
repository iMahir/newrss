       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The U.S. State Department's 2023 religious freedom report on India noted violent attacks on minority groups, especially Muslims and Christians, including killings, assaults and vandalism of houses of worship.</p>

<p>The State Department report on international religious freedom released on Wednesday said that during the year, senior U.S. officials continued to "raise concerns about religious freedom issues" with their Indian counterparts.</p>

<p>Human rights experts say India has seen a rise in attacks on minorities under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who recently won a third term, and his Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Criticism of India by the U.S. is usually restrained due to close economic ties and New Delhi's importance for Washington to counter China, political analysts say.</p>

<p>The U.S. report listed dozens of incidents. Among them was a fatal shooting of a security official and three Muslims on a train near Mumbai by a suspect who was a railway security official. A probe by Indian authorities into that case is ongoing and the suspect was in jail, according to the Indian Express newspaper.</p>

<p>The U.S. report also cited examples of attacks against Muslims based on allegations that Muslim men were participating in the slaughter of cows or beef trading.</p>

<p>The Indian embassy in Washington had no immediate comment on the report. The Indian government denies discriminating against minorities, and says its welfare policies - such as food subsidy schemes and electrification drives - aim to benefit all Indians.</p>

<p>Rights advocates contest that and point to anti-Muslim hate speeches, the revoking of Muslim-majority Kashmir's special status, a citizenship law that the U.N. calls "fundamentally discriminatory" and the demolition of Muslim properties in the name of removing illegal construction.</p>

<p>The State Department report also cited violence in the northeastern state of Manipur that started in May last year between minority, mostly Christian, Kuki and majority, mostly Hindu, Meitei ethnic groups.</p>

<p>Hindu and Christian places of worship were destroyed in Manipur. Citing a local tribal leaders' forum, the report said over 250 churches were burnt down, more than 200 people were killed and over 60,000 were displaced.</p>

<p>Hindus make up about 80% of India's 1.4 billion population while Muslims include 14% and Christians over 2%.</p>

<p>The report also pointed to anti-conversion legislation in some Indian states that rights advocates say challenges the right to freedom of belief.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;Russian pranksters who often target people the Russian state is interested in released footage on Wednesday of a video call with British Foreign Secretary David Cameron after tricking him into thinking he was speaking to a former Ukrainian president.</p>

<p>London's Foreign Office said earlier this month that Cameron had held a video call with someone purporting to be former Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko before realising he was the victim of a hoax.</p>

<p>The call, which appears to have lasted around 15 minutes and in which Cameron is shown talking on his mobile phone dressed casually somewhere outside, was carried out by Russian pranksters who use the aliases "Vovan and Lexus."</p>

<p>The duo is well-known inside Russia having duped a string of Western politicians over the years, including Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and, in 2022, then British defence minister Ben Wallace.</p>

<p>The Foreign Office said on Wednesday that the call looked like a Russian information operation designed to distract attention from Moscow's war in Ukraine. It did not answer a question about the video's authenticity.</p>

<p>Vovan and Lexus have in the past denied Western accusations that they have links to Russia's intelligence services, though they often ask their victims questions that would be of interest to the Russian state.</p>

<p>In Wednesday's video, the authenticity of which Reuters could not independently verify, Cameron is seen and heard talking about sensitive Ukraine-related topics.</p>

<p><strong>LOBBYING TRUMP</strong></p>

<p>In particular, he is heard talking about a private dinner he had with U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump in April during which he lobbied Trump to allow Republicans to vote in favour of U.S. military aid for Ukraine.</p>

<p>Cameron is heard saying that the Republican party is split on Ukraine and that he had told Trump that he was wrong if he thought Putin just wanted Crimea and Donbas, two of five Ukrainian regions Moscow now says are part of Russia.</p>

<p>The Washington Post reported in April that Trump had privately spoken about the option of allowing Putin to keep Crimea and Donbas in return for peace, something Trump's campaign has not confirmed.</p>

<p>Cameron is heard saying such an idea is flawed.</p>

<p>"Trump is convinced there's a deal to be made and that's not the case because Putin wants so much more," says Cameron, adding that he thinks Trump, if he wins the presidency, will support the winning side on the battlefield and that is why this summer's fighting is so important.</p>

<p>Cameron is also heard saying Ukraine will not be invited to join the NATO military alliance at a summit next month because Washington is opposed to the idea. Cameron also says he does not think a potential French plan to send troops to Ukraine is the right approach because they would become a target for Putin.</p>

<p>In another segment, he is heard recounting a conversation with the foreign minister of Kazakhstan who he said had told him the Central Asian nation feared Russia "wanted a slice" of northern Kazakhstan where many ethnic Russians live.</p>

<p>A spokesperson for Britain's Foreign Office said in a statement:</p>

<p>"...We made public the fact that this call happened weeks ago, to do the right thing and make sure others were warned of the risk at the earliest opportunity. The Foreign Secretary understood this was a private call with a Ukrainian politician.</p>

<p>"This is clearly Russian, and is standard practice for information operations. Disinformation is a tactic straight from the Kremlin playbook to try to distract from their illegal activities in Ukraine and the human rights abuses being committed there."</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said on a visit to Washington that his country does not want war in Lebanon but was ready to inflict "massive damage" on Hezbollah if diplomacy fails.</p>

<p>"We do not want war, but we are preparing for every scenario," Gallant told reporters during the visit that ended Wednesday.</p>

<p>"Hezbollah understands very well that we can inflict massive damage in Lebanon if a war is launched," he said.</p>

<p>Tensions have been rising, with growing skirmishes along the border between Israel and the Iranian-backed militia, since the October 7 attack by Hamas that prompted a relentless Israeli retaliatory campaign in Gaza.</p>

<p>Gallant said that Israel has killed more than 400 Hezbollah "terrorists" in recent months.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bolivian authorities arrested General Juan Jose Zuniga on Wednesday afternoon, a Reuters witness saw, hours after troops stormed into the presidential palace amid a military coup attempt.</p>

<p>Bolivia's government and international leaders denounced</p>

<p>Bolivian armed forces pulled back from the presidential palace in La Paz on Wednesday evening and a general was arrested after President Luis Arce slammed a "coup" attempt against the government and called for international support.</p>

<p>Earlier in the day, military units led by General Juan Jose Zuniga, recently stripped of his military command, had gathered in the central Plaza Murillo square, home to the presidential palace and Congress. A Reuters witness saw an armored vehicle ram a door of the presidential palace and soldiers rush in.</p>

<p>"Today the country is facing an attempted coup d'état. Today the country faces once again interests so that democracy in Bolivia is cut short," Arce said in comments from the presidential palace, with armed soldiers outside.</p>

<p>"The Bolivian people are summoned today. We need the Bolivian people to organize and mobilize against the coup d'état in favor of democracy."</p>

<p>A few hours later, a Reuters witness saw soldiers withdraw from the square and police take control of the plaza. Bolivian authorities arrested Zuniga and took him away, though their destination was unclear.</p>

<p>Inside the presidential palace, Arce swore in José Wilson Sanchez as the military commander, Zuniga's former role. He called for calm and order to be restored.</p>

<p>"I order that all personnel mobilized on the streets return to their units," Sanchez said. "We entreat that the blood of our soldiers not be spilled."</p>

<p>The United States said it was closely monitoring the situation and urged calm and restraint.</p>

<p>Tensions have been building in Bolivia ahead of general elections in 2025, with leftist ex-President Evo Morales planning to run against former ally Arce, creating a major rift in the ruling socialist party and wider political uncertainty.</p>

<p>Many do not want a return of Morales, who governed from 2006-2019 when he was ousted amid widespread protests and replaced by an interim conservative government. Arce then won election in 2020.</p>

<p>Zuniga said recently that Morales should not be able to return as president and threatened to block him if he attempted to, which led Arce to remove Zuniga from his post.</p>

<p>Ahead of the attack on the presidential palace, Zuniga had addressed reporters in the square and cited growing anger in the landlocked country, which has been battling an economic slump with depleted central bank reserves and pressure on the boliviano currency as gas exports have dried up.</p>

<p>"The three chiefs of the armed forces have come to express our dismay," Zuniga told a local TV station, calling for a new cabinet of ministers.</p>

<p>"Stop destroying, stop impoverishing our country, stop humiliating our army," he said in full uniform, flanked by soldiers, insisting the action being taken was supported by the public.</p>

<p><strong>'STRONGEST CONDEMNATION'</strong></p>

<p>Morales, head of the ruling MAS socialist party, said that his supporters would mobilize in support of democracy.</p>

<p>"We will not allow the armed forces to violate democracy and intimidate people," Morales said.</p>

<p>Bolivia's public prosecutor's office said it would launch a criminal investigation against Zuniga and others involved in the attempted coup.</p>

<p>Public support for Arce and Bolivia's democracy has poured in from regional leaders and beyond.</p>

<p>"We express the strongest condemnation of the attempted coup d'état in Bolivia. Our total support and support for President Luis Alberto Arce Catacora," Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said on X.</p>

<p>Even conservative political opponents of the government in Bolivia condemned the military action, including ex-President Jeanine Anez, who was imprisoned in 2022 amid political turmoil.</p>

<p>"I fully reject of the mobilization of the military in the Plaza Murillo attempting to destroy constitutional order," she wrote on X. "The MAS with Arce and Evo must be got out through the vote in 2025. We Bolivians will defend democracy."</p>

       <description><![CDATA[A court in New York on Wednesday sentenced former Honduran president Juan Orlando Hernandez to 45 years in prison after he was convicted of trafficking hundreds of tons of cocaine into the United States.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A court in New York on Wednesday sentenced former Honduran president Juan Orlando Hernandez to 45 years in prison after he was convicted of trafficking hundreds of tons of cocaine into the United States.</p>

<p>Anti-Hernandez protesters gathered outside the Manhattan courthouse ahead of sentencing brandishing placards decrying the former head of state's crimes with one declaring "Narco government -- makes the people emigrate."</p>

<p>"The role of Mr Hernandez was to use his political power as president of Congress and president of Honduras to limit the risks of drug traffickers in exchange of money," said Judge Kevin Castel as the disgraced statesman stood impassively.</p>

<p>He said Hernandez provided police and military support and helped to send 400 tons of drugs -- worth $10 billion at market prices -- to the United States.</p>

<p>In a speech ahead of sentencing, Hernandez, who wore prison garb and used a walking stick to enter court, was interrupted by the judge for contesting the trial's outcome and insisting he was wrongly charged.</p>

<p>The sentence, which also included an $8 million fine, was less than the life imprisonment that prosecutors had sought -- although Hernandez's age, 55, means he may die behind bars.</p>

<p>"He's going to pursue every single possible legal remedy that he can pursue," Hernandez's lawyer Renato Stabile told reporters outside court.</p>

<p><strong>- War on drugs -</strong></p>

<p>Hernandez, who US federal prosecutors said turned his Central American country into a "narco-state" during his 2014-2022 presidency, has previously indicated through his legal team he would appeal his conviction.</p>

<p>He was convicted in March of having facilitated the smuggling of hundreds of tons of cocaine -- mainly from Colombia and Venezuela -- to the United States via Honduras since 2004, starting long before he became president.</p>

<p>Hernandez used the drug money to enrich himself and finance his political campaign, and commit electoral fraud in the 2013 and 2017 elections, prosecutors said.</p>

<p>He had presented himself as a champion of the war on drugs and was initially seen by Washington as an ally in the fight.</p>

<p>In 2017, the United States was one of the first countries to recognize his re-election, while the opposition denounced fraud against a backdrop of violent protests that left some 30 people dead.</p>

<p>He was extradited to the United States in 2022 using a law he had himself helped to pass as Congress president under pressure from Washington, accused of aiding drug smugglers in return for millions of dollars in bribes.</p>

<p>US Attorney General Merrick Garland said Hernandez "abused his power to support one of the largest and most violent drug trafficking conspiracies in the world, and the people of Honduras and the United States bore the consequences."</p>

<p>The fall of Hernandez, who is known in his country as "JOH," was abrupt.</p>

<p>No sooner had he handed over power to the new left-wing president Xiomara Castro, the outgoing leader was shackled and paraded in front of journalists.</p>

<p>Hernandez follows in the footsteps of other former Latin American heads of state convicted in the United States, including Panama's Manuel Noriega in 1992 and Guatemala's Alfonso Portillo in 2014.</p>

<p>The short, athletic leader was known for his military haircut, having served as an officer before training as a lawyer, completing a masters degree in New York in 1995.</p>

<p>His legal woes began in earnest in 2018 when his brother, Juan Antonio Hernandez, was arrested in Miami and sentenced in March 2021 to life imprisonment for "large-scale" drug trafficking.</p>

<p>After his arrest in Honduras in February 2022, Hernandez said he was a victim of "revenge" by the drug lords, many of whom testified against him in New York.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[North Korea claimed to have successfully tested its multiple-warhead missile capability, according to state-run KCNA news agency Thursday.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>North Korea claimed to have successfully tested its multiple-warhead missile capability, according to state-run KCNA news agency Thursday.</p>

<p>Pyongyang "successfully conducted the separation and guidance control test of individual mobile warheads" on Wednesday," KCNA reported, adding that the "separated mobile warheads were guided correctly to the three coordinate targets."</p>

<p>"The test is aimed at securing the MIRV capability," it said, referring to multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle technology -- or, the ability to fire multiple warheads on a single ballistic missile.</p>

<p>The statement came a day after South Korea's military said the North had test-fired what appeared to be a hypersonic missile on Wednesday, but the launch ended in a mid-air explosion.</p>

<p>The missile took off from an area in or around Pyongyang at about 5:30 am (2030 GMT) and South Korean and US intelligence agencies were conducting a detailed analysis, Seoul's Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement.</p>

<p>The JCS official said the test of what appeared to be a hypersonic missile ended in failure after a journey of some 250 kilometres (155 miles).</p>

<p>More smoke than usual appeared to emanate from the missile, raising the possibility of combustion issues, the official said, adding it may have been powered by solid propellants.</p>

<p>Japan also confirmed the launch, with its coast guard saying the missile splashed down in the Sea of Japan, also known as the East Sea.</p>

<p>According to KCNA, the test "was carried out by use of the first-stage engine of an intermediate-range solid-fuel ballistic missile within a 170-200 km radius."</p>

<p>"The effectiveness of a decoy separated from the missile was also verified by anti-air radar," it said.</p>

<p>The test follows North Korea launching hundreds more trash-carrying balloons southward on Monday and Tuesday, the latest in a series of border barrages that have sparked a tit-for-tat propaganda campaign.</p>

<p>Late Wednesday, South Korea's military said the North has again floated another round of trash-carrying balloons southward for the third consecutive day, advising the public to report the balloons if spotted and refrain from touching them.</p>

<p>In response, Seoul has fully suspended a tension-reducing military deal and restarted some propaganda broadcasts from loudspeakers along the border.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, South Korea's Marine Corps resumed live-fire exercises on islands near the western inter-Korean border on Wednesday, marking the first such exercises since a 2018 tension-reducing military deal with the North was suspended earlier this month over the balloon-borne propaganda.</p>

<p>South Korea and the US also staged joint air drills Wednesday involving around 30 aircraft, including Washington's advanced stealth fighter jet, F-22 Raptor.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, President Yoon Suk Yeol visited a US aircraft carrier that arrived in South Korea at the weekend for joint military drills aimed at countering North Korean threats.</p>

<p>The drills, which include Japan, are set to go ahead later this month.</p>

<p>Pyongyang has routinely criticised such exercises as rehearsals for an invasion.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At least 20 people were injured after a passenger train derailed in Russia's Far North on Wednesday, authorities said.</p>

<p>The train was going from the city of Vorkuta, above the Arctic Circle, to the port of Novorossiysk on the Black Sea in the south of the country.</p>

<p>It derailed near the small town of Inta in the Komi Republic, which has a harsh climate and is scarcely populated.</p>

<p>Vladimir Uyba, the head of the Komi republic, said there 215 passengers onboard the train, adding: "20 people were injured, three in a serious condition."</p>

<p>He said the five last carriages of the train derailed, but authorities did not immediately give a reason for the cause of the accident.</p>

<p>Uyba said he was flying out to the scene of the accident.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>Images published by Russian state media showed several carriages lying on their side in a ditch by a forest.</p>

<p>It takes almost five days for the Vorkuta-Novorossiysk train to complete its journey.</p>

<p>Transport accidents are not uncommon in Russia, but less so on railways, with the country, the largest in the world, having a massive rail network.</p>

<p>Since Moscow launched its Ukraine offensive, Russia has battled a wave of sabotage acts on its railways, used by the army to transport equipment to Ukraine.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A notorious German pensioner known as the "Nazi grandma" who has been jailed several times for denying the Holocaust was sentenced to another 16 months at her latest trial on Wednesday.</p>

<p>A Hamburg court convicted Ursula Haverbeck, 95, of denying the Nazi genocide on several occasions, including in 2015 during the trial of a former Nazi camp guard.</p>

<p>In their sentencing, the judges took into account her previous convictions and the fact she had "also used the proceedings to further disseminate her views", a court spokeswoman told AFP.</p>

<p>Haverbeck repeated her remarks on the Holocaust several times at the trial.</p>

<p>Supporters of the pensioner showed up on Wednesday and repeatedly interrupted proceedings with heckling, the spokeswoman said.</p>

<p>Haverbeck was once head of a far-right training centre shut down in 2008 for spreading Nazi propaganda.</p>

<p>She has previously been sentenced on several occasions to jail for denying the Nazi genocide, once declaring on television that "the Holocaust is the biggest and most sustained lie in history."</p>

<p>Haverbeck was sentenced this time after losing an appeal over a conviction for comments allegedly made in 2015 during the trial of former Auschwitz guard Oskar Groening, who was convicted of being an accessory to murder.</p>

<p>Haverbeck said the Auschwitz concentration camp was just a labour camp and no mass murder had taken place there, according to prosecutors.</p>

<p>The proceedings were delayed several times due to the coronavirus pandemic and illness.</p>

<p>The sentencing also takes into account a previous conviction by a Berlin court in 2022 over statements made by Haverbeck in another interview and at an event.</p>

<p>It was not clear whether she would actually go to jail.</p>

<p>German law makes it illegal to deny the genocide committed by Adolf Hitler's regime, which in the Auschwitz-Birkenau camp in occupied Poland alone claimed some 1.1 million lives, mostly European Jews.</p>

<p>Holocaust denial and other forms of incitement to hatred carry up to five years in prison, while the use of Nazi symbols such as swastikas is also banned.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>King Charles III's sister Princess Anne is "recovering slowly" in hospital, her husband said Wednesday, after she suffered a concussion in an incident with a horse at her country estate.</p>

<p>"She'll be out when she's ready," Tim Laurence also told reporters outside Southmead Hospital in Bristol, western England, where Anne was taken on Sunday.</p>

<p>Anne, 73, suffered concussion and minor head injuries at Gatcombe Park on Sunday evening and was airlifted to hospital.</p>

<p>It is believed she was struck by a horse as she was walking within the protected perimeter of the sprawling estate, which hosts equestrian events.</p>

<p>The princess's medical team said her injuries are consistent with a potential impact from a horse's head or legs.</p>

<p>British media reported Wednesday that Anne's concussion meant the precise details of what happened are not clear.</p>

<p>The Princess Royal, as she is also known, is a skilled horsewoman who competed at the 1976 Montreal Olympics, and has a reputation as the hardest-working royal.</p>

<p>She has stepped in to represent King Charles while he postponed public engagements during his cancer treatment, and rode at his official birthday parade this month.</p>

<p>But the accident forced her to withdraw from an appearance at a state banquet on Tuesday evening for visiting Japanese Emperor Naruhito, and cancel an upcoming trip to Canada.</p>

<p>Buckingham Palace said Anne was in hospital "as a precautionary measure for observation and is expected to make a full and swift recovery".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US State Department on Wednesday renewed its allegation that WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange put people at risk for revealing secrets, after he was freed in a plea deal.</p>

<p>"The documents they published gave identifying information of individuals who were in contact with the State Department -- that included opposition leaders, human rights activists around the world -- whose positions were put in some danger because of their public disclosure," State Department spokesman Matthew Miller told reporters.</p>

<p>"It also chilled the ability of American personnel to build relationships and have frank conversations," Miller said.</p>

<p>Assange had published hundreds of thousands of confidential US documents on the WikiLeaks whistleblowing website from 2010.</p>

<p>The Australian agreed to plead guilty to a single count of conspiracy to obtain and disseminate national defense information and was sentenced to the time he had served in London -- five years and two months -- and given his liberty.</p>

<p>Assange has become a hero for activists who point to his role in divulging information about the US wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, but critics fault him for putting out vast quantities of government documents without any filtering.</p>

<p>Miller said that the State Department at the time "had to scramble to get people out of danger, to move them out of harm's way."</p>

<p>Pressed on whether anyone was harmed in the end, Miller said, "If you drive drunk down the street and get pulled over for drunk driving, the fact that you didn't crash into another car and kill someone doesn't get you out of the reckless actions and the endangerment that you put your fellow citizens in."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Amazon.com plans to launch a section on its shopping site featuring cheap items that ship directly to overseas consumers from warehouses in China, the Information reported on Wednesday, citing slides shown to Chinese sellers.</p>

<p>The new marketplace, Amazon's most aggressive response to the growth of bargain sites like Temu and Shein, will offer unbranded fashion, home goods, and daily necessities, according to the slides, and will be delivered between 9 to 11 days to customers, the report said.</p>

<p>The e-commerce giant in a recent closed-door meeting told Chinese sellers it would start signing up merchants this summer and begin accepting inventory in the fall, according to the Information.</p>

<p>Amazon did not immediately respond to Reuters request for comment on the report.</p>

<p>Sellers joining the bargain site can determine their product selection and pricing, and can produce in small batches to test the demand for any new products they plan to launch, the report added.</p>

<p>It is not clear if these shipments will be made using a U.S. trade provision that exempts individual packages worth less than $800 from US customs duties, Information reported.</p>

<p>E-commerce powerhouse Shein, which is trying to expand its market share before going public, and PDD Group-owned e-retailer Temu, depend on the expedited clearance process, which is available for direct-to-consumer shipments valued at $800 or less.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kenyan President William Ruto said Wednesday that a bill containing contentious tax hikes would "be withdrawn", dramatically reversing course after more than 20 people were killed in clashes with police and parliament was ransacked by protesters opposed to the legislation.</p>

<p>The initially peaceful demonstrations were sparked last week by the 2024 finance bill -- which politicians passed Tuesday afternoon -- and took Ruto's administration by surprise as rallies gathered momentum across the country.</p>

<p>But the Gen-Z-led protests spiralled into violence Tuesday when police fired live bullets at the crowds outside parliament, leaving the complex ransacked and partly on fire.</p>

<p>Nineteen people were killed in the capital Nairobi, a state-funded rights watchdog said.</p>

<p>"I concede and therefore I will not sign the 2024 finance bill and it shall subsequently be withdrawn," Ruto told a press briefing. "The people have spoken," he said.</p>

<p>"I will be proposing an engagement with the young people of our nation, our sons and daughters, for us to listen to them," he said, in a marked shift from his late-night address Tuesday when he likened some of the demonstrators to "criminals".</p>

<p>'Cannot kill all of us'</p>

<p>Immediately after his speech, prominent protester Hanifa Adan dismissed Ruto's announcement as "PR".</p>

<p>Referring to his comments the previous night, she said on X: "He made that speech trying to intimidate us and he saw it won't work hence the PR."</p>

<p>"The bill is withdrawn but are you going to bring everyone that died back alive?"</p>

<p>Ahead of Ruto's about-turn, protesters had called for fresh rallies on Thursday.</p>

<p>"Tomorrow, we march peacefully again as we wear white, for all our fallen people," Adan had said.</p>

<p>"You cannot kill all of us."</p>

<p>Demonstrators shared "Tupatane Thursday" ("we meet Thursday" in Swahili), alongside the hashtag #Rejectfinancebill2024 on social media.</p>

<p>Cost-of-living crisis</p>

<p>Ruto came to power in 2022 promising to champion the needs of impoverished Kenyans, but tax increases under his government have only made life tougher for those already struggling with high inflation.</p>

<p>The Kenyan leader had already rolled back some tax measures last week, prompting the treasury to warn of a gaping budget shortfall of 200 billion shillings.</p>

<p>Ruto said Wednesday that withdrawing the bill would mean a significant hole in funding for development programmes to help farmers and schoolteachers, among others.</p>

<p>The cash-strapped government had said previously that the increases were needed to service Kenya's massive debt of some 10 trillion shillings ($78 billion), equal to roughly 70 percent of GDP.</p>

<p>Deadly day</p>

<p>Earlier on Wednesday, Roseline Odede, chairwoman of the state-funded Kenya National Commission on Human Rights, said "we have recorded 22 deaths", 19 of them in Nairobi, adding that they would launch an investigation.</p>

<p>"This is the largest number of deaths (in) a single day protest," she said, adding that 300 people were injured across the country.</p>

<p>Simon Kigondu, president of the Kenya Medical Association, said he had never before seen "such level of violence against unarmed people."</p>

<p>An official at Kenyatta National Hospital in Nairobi said Wednesday that medics were treating "160 people...some of them with soft tissue injuries, some of them with bullet wounds."</p>

<p>Rights watchdogs have also accused the authorities of kidnapping protesters.</p>

<p>The police have not responded to AFP requests for comment.</p>

<p>'Madness'</p>

<p>A heavy police presence was deployed around parliament early on Wednesday, according to an AFP reporter, the smell of tear gas still in the air and dried blood on the ground.</p>

<p>A policeman standing in front of the broken barricades to the complex told AFP he had watched the scenes unfold on TV.</p>

<p>"It was madness, we hope it will be calm today," he said.</p>

<p>In the central business district, where the protests have been concentrated, traders surveyed the damage.</p>

<p>"They didn't leave anything, just the boxes. I don't know how long it will take me to recover," James Ng'ang'a, whose electronics shop was looted, told AFP.</p>

<p>The unrest has alarmed the international community, with Washington calling on Kenya to respect the right to peaceful protest on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Ruto's administration is under pressure from the IMF, which has urged the country to implement fiscal reforms in order to access funding.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sri Lanka said on Wednesday it had clinched a restructuring deal with India, China, and other nations, covering up to $10 billion in debt, a critical step towards recovery after a 2022 financial crash. The agreement is expected to revive stalled infrastructure projects, including a Japanese-funded airport expansion and a new mass transit light rail in the capital, President Ranil Wickremesinghe said.</p>

<p>Sri Lanka defaulted on its foreign debt in April 2022 after running out of foreign exchange, and the unprecedented economic crisis forced then-president Gotabaya Rajapaksa to step down.</p>

<p>"Sri Lanka concluded negotiations with the Official Creditor Committee (OCC) and the Exim Bank of China," Wickremesinghe said in a televised Sinhalese-language address to the nation.</p>

<p>"Sri Lanka won," he added in English while thanking the OCC, which included Japan, India, the United States, Canada and several European nations.</p>

<p>He said the deal with OCC nations was reached in Paris, while an agreement with the Exim Bank of China was signed in Beijing on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Sri Lanka secured a moratorium on repayments until 2028, he said, but gave no further details.</p>

<p>His supporters in the capital Colombo let off firecrackers and distributed milk rice in celebration as he spoke.</p>

<p>Wickremesinghe said the nation was bankrupt when he took over almost two years ago and he hoped the International Monetary Fund bailout of $2.9 billion he secured last year would be the island's last.</p>

<p>Colombo had gone to the IMF, the international lender of last resort, on 16 previous occasions and the debt restructuring is a condition of the IMF bailout.</p>

<p>Wickremesinghe has doubled taxes, removed generous energy subsidies and is set to sell off loss-making state enterprises to shore up state revenue under that deal.</p>

<h2><strong>Teachers strike over pay</strong></h2>

<p>India welcomed Sri Lanka's deal and pledged more support.</p>

<p>"This milestone (agreement) demonstrates the strong progress made by Sri Lanka in stabilising its economy and moving towards reform and growth," the Indian government said in a statement.</p>

<p>Bilateral creditors account for 28.5 percent of Sri Lanka's outstanding foreign debt of $37 billion, according to treasury data from the end of March.</p>

<p>China accounts for $4.66 billion of a total of $10.58 billion borrowed from other countries.</p>

<p>Japan accounts for $2.35 billion and India for $1.36 billion.</p>

<p>The government said it was in talks with international bondholders but there was no agreement. A previous round of talks ended in deadlock in April.</p>

<p>Sri Lanka is unable to raise commercial loans until a deal with private creditors is struck.</p>

<p>However, the agreement with bilateral creditors allows the unfreezing of loans for ongoing infrastructure projects financed with funding from other countries.</p>

<p>Thousands of teachers from government schools went on strike in Colombo on Wednesday demanding higher pay, with police using water cannon and tear gas to disperse the protest.</p>

<p>Sri Lanka is due to hold a presidential election this year and opposition parties have vowed to renegotiate the terms of the IMF bailout.</p>

<p>The IMF's Sri Lanka mission chief Peter Breuer said the fund was willing to listen to alternative proposals from rival political parties, but said it was necessary to stick to the benchmarks set in the bailout.</p>

<p>Sri Lanka had made good progress but was not out of the woods yet, he said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Joe Biden and Donald Trump prepared Wednesday for the biggest moment so far in the US election -- the first of two high-stakes debates that could upend the race.</p>

<p>Thursday's showdown will raise the campaigning to boiling point, with both camps recently escalating their increasingly personal attacks.</p>

<p>"I think I have been preparing for it for my whole life...We'll do very well," Trump told right-wing network Newsmax in an interview on his debate preparation.</p>

<p>The 2024 election looks close, with Trump enjoying a slight polling advantage in the all-important swing states in an election likely to be decided by a few hundred thousand votes across a handful of battlegrounds.</p>

<p>The rivals both step onstage for the 90-minute clash, hosted by CNN in the southern city of Atlanta, seeking to allay fears about serious political liabilities.</p>

<p>Biden, 81, faces the most concern about his mental sharpness, with voters much more likely to bring up his age than Trump's, despite the Republican being just three years younger.</p>

<h2><strong>'Out for himself'</strong></h2>

<p>Both have faltered and appeared muddled during public events, although Trump in particular has raised eyebrows over his rambling and occasionally bizarre campaign speeches.</p>

<p>Trump is also engulfed in controversy over his inflammatory rhetoric and a glut of criminal cases he faces, as well as fears that he would weaponize the presidency to settle personal scores.</p>

<p>Biden spent the week off the radar at the mountainside retreat of Camp David near Washington, preparing with mock debates.</p>

<p>Trump's preparation has been more relaxed, eschewing dress rehearsals in favor of informal policy roundtables and workshopping debate strategy with rally crowds.</p>

<p>Aides have encouraged him to focus on his perceived strength on the economy and crime, while Biden will seek to paint Trump as unhinged and unfit for office.</p>

<p>The Biden campaign released an ad saying Trump is preoccupied with "revenge" rather than helping voters, and the Democratic National Committee put up billboards in Atlanta reminding voters that the Republican is a convicted felon.</p>

<p>"Come November, Georgians will head to the polls remembering that President Biden looks out for them, while white-collar crook Donald Trump will only look out for himself," said DNC spokesperson Jackie Bush.</p>

<h2><strong>'Ready for this'?</strong></h2>

<p>The Trump campaign has repeatedly characterized Biden as feeble and incompetent, but changed tack in recent days following warnings that setting low expectations for the Democratic president would only help him.</p>

<p>"We know that Joe Biden, that after taking an entire week off, will be ready for this," senior Trump campaign advisor Jason Miller told reporters.</p>

<p>Backed by right-wing media figures, Trump and his team have been pushing the baseless theory that Biden will be hyped up on performance-enhancing drugs.</p>

<p>The ex-president and his people have also been accused of "working the ref" and laying the groundwork for a poor Trump performance by repeatedly making insinuations of bias on the part of CNN.</p>

<p>Miller said Trump would emerge as the clear choice if "allowed" to set out his vision for America "without the blatant interference of CNN or the two moderators" of the debate -- the first ever between two candidates who have already served in the Oval Office.</p>

<p>One of Biden's biggest vulnerabilities is border security, with Trump promising to combat an influx of undocumented migrants from Mexico with mass deportations and repeatedly bringing up killings by migrants.</p>

<p>US media reported that Trump is expected to invite family members of victims of migrant violence to Atlanta, although the debate itself will have no audience.</p>

<p>The Biden administration announced Wednesday that new restrictions had brought illegal migrant crossings to their lowest levels in more than three years, undercutting immigration as an attack line.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cash-strapped Pakistan is likely to privatize its national flag carrier by the first week of August, a media report said on Wednesday.</p>

<p>The much-anticipated privatization of Pakistan International Airline (PIA) has been on top of the agenda of the government after the groundwork was completed by the caretaker government that was in place to organize elections.</p>

<p>Citing sources close to the development, private television channel ARY News reported that six companies have been shortlisted for the privatization of the national flag carrier.</p>

<p>The shortlisted companies have sought details related to PIA and asked for time till July to review the financial issues of the national airline.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the authorities are providing the required information to the consortium of shortlisted companies.</p>

<p>It is pertinent to mention here that a consortium of six companies has been pre-qualified for privatizing Pakistan International Airlines (PIA).</p>

<p>According to the details, the companies that lie in the pre-qualified consortium will now be eligible to participate in the bidding process for the PIA.</p>

<p>The decision was made during the Privatisation Commission Board meeting this week which was chaired by Privatization Minister Aleem Khan, who emphasized the government's commitment to ensuring a transparent and efficient privatisation process for all loss-making state-owned companies.</p>

<p>To maintain transparency and foster confidence, Khan proposed broadcasting the privatisation proceedings live on media platforms to assure all stakeholders about the integrity of the process.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A new AI-based model could predict the onset of Alzheimer's disease by analysing an individual's speech, the developers said.</p>

<p>Trained on audio recordings of patients with mild cognitive impairment -- early stages of memory loss, the model achieved 78.5 per cent accuracy in forecasting whether patients would remain stable or progress to dementia within six years, according to the researchers.</p>

<p>Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia and impacts one's everyday activities by impairing memory and thinking.</p>

<p>The researchers at Boston University, US, used recordings of initial interviews of 166 patients aged 63-97 and trained the model using machine learning to discern patterns between speech, demographics, diagnosis, and how their condition was worsening.</p>

<p>The model analyses interview content such as spoken words and sentence structure, rather than speech features such as enunciation or speed, showed the study published in the journal Alzheimer's and Dementia.</p>

<p>"We combine the information we extract from the audio recordings with some very basic demographics - age, gender, and so on - and we get the final score," said Ioannis C. Paschalidis, a professor of engineering and the study's corresponding author.</p>

<p>"You can think of the score as the likelihood, the probability, that someone will remain stable or transition to dementia. It had significant predictive ability," said Paschalidis.</p>

<p>The researchers said that the model was able to perform well, despite challenges like low-quality recordings and background noise.</p>

<p>The researchers emphasised that early prediction is crucial as current diagnostic tests often identify Alzheimer's disease only after significant cognitive decline has occurred such as memories starting to slip away and personality traits beginning to shift.</p>

<p>The team aims to make their model accessible through an app to make it accessible for patients in remote areas, potentially increasing the number of people getting screened.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Wednesday extended an olive branch to his predecessor and political rival Imran Khan, offering to hold talks with him if was facing "troubles" in jail.</p>

<p>Mr Khan, the founder of his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party, has been in jail since August last year after being convicted in some of the nearly 200 cases slapped on the 71-year-old cricketer-turned-politician since his ouster from power in April 2022.</p>

<p>"If their [PTI] founder is facing troubles [in jail], then I reiterate: come, let's sit down and talk," Mr Sharif said while addressing the National Assembly.</p>

<p>“Let us sit together to take the country ahead. Let us talk for the betterment of the country. There is no other way forward,” he said.</p>

<p>The Nawaz Sharif-led Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) and Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf have been at loggerheads for years, particularly after the February 8 elections, which Mr Khan's party claims it had won.</p>

<p>Commenting on the 2018 elections won by Mr Khan's PTI, Mr Sharif said: "We joined Parliament despite the [rigged] polls. The sort of slogans that were raised during my first speech will always be remembered as a dark chapter in the history books."</p>

<p>"If someone is facing any injustice, then I believe that the scales of justice should be in favour of those [being victimised], there is no difference over it — whether it be any politician or anyone from any walk of life," Geo News quoted Sharif as saying.</p>

<p>Mr Sharif lamented that he had once again, while he was in the opposition, proposed to Mr Khan to sit for a dialogue but such slogans were raised again.</p>

<p>"So who is responsible for this bitterness [between politicians]. We don't even shake hands now," he said.</p>

<p>Mr Sharif, 72, also recounted his ordeal of facing victimisation by Mr Khan's government and that he was in jail when his mother passed away. He said that despite being a cancer survivor and with a backbone issue, he used to be taken to courts on the ordinary prison van just to exacerbate the condition, but he never complained.</p>

<p>In response to Prime Minister Sharif's remarks, Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly Omar Ayub reiterated that the PTI would talk with the government only when Mr Khan and other incarcerated leaders and workers are released from jail.</p>

<p>"This should be in your minds: you torture our workers, you've kept our lady workers in prison vans at 45°C. My prime minister Imran Khan was kept in a death cell, there's an oven-like environment over there," he said, amidst sloganeering from the treasury benches.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The US transport security body has sought a unique "one-stop agreement" with India to end the rescreening of passengers, asserting that the "really powerful" concept will raise global aviation security standards.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US transport security body has sought a unique "one-stop agreement" with India to end the rescreening of passengers, asserting that the "really powerful" concept will raise global aviation security standards.</p>

<p>Addressing the India US Aviation Summit here on Tuesday, David Pekoske, Administrator of the US Transportation Security Administration (USTSA) said that the one-stop security concept is "very reachable" between the countries.</p>

<p>"I think very tangible and very reachable between India and the United States is one-stop security," he said.</p>

<p>"It's a concept that expedites the flow of passengers and baggage to their destinations by eliminating the duplication of security controls at transfer points," Pekoske said.</p>

<p>He said in the case of a one-stop agreement, passengers who reach an airport in another country and have a connecting domestic flight would not need to be rescreened and their checked bags would go from aircraft to aircraft.</p>

<p>Terming it a "really powerful" concept, Pekoske said it raises global aviation security standards.</p>

<p>"Flights inbound to the United States are more secure. If there's a reverse agreement between the United States and India where US screening satisfies Indian requirements, that means that flights to India would also be more secure. It does require the regular exchange of information," he said.</p>

<p>"It requires improvements to security processes to maintain the agreement. It yields a reduction in security costs through better allocation of resources, reduces flight connection times and missed connections, and improves the passenger experience," he said.</p>

<p>Pekoske said the two countries should consider signing a memorandum of agreement to share sensitive security information.</p>

<p>"We have a category of classification of information that is not classified in the true sense of classified material, but it is sensitive enough that it needs additional protections," he said.</p>

<p>He said that whenever there is a sharing of sensitive security information -- which is critical to a growing partnership -- there is a need to have a memorandum of agreement which covers the aspects of that sharing arrangement.</p>

<p>He noted that both the TSA and India's transportation security posture were born of cruel tragedy.</p>

<p>For India, it was the bombing of Air India 'Kanishka' Flight 182 in 1985, while for the TSA, it was the 9-11 attacks in 2001.</p>

<p>"These tragic events were paradigm shifts in how we both thought about transportation security that continues today," he said.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, addressing the summit, US Federal Aviation Administrator Michael Whitaker said that India and the United States need to work together on issues like aviation safety.</p>

<p>Asserting that safety is a team sport, he said that sharing data between the two countries can allow better identification and mitigation of risks in the sector.</p>

<p>"Our (US and India's) national systems of aviation are inextricably linked into a single global network," he said, adding that the two counties have adjoining air spaces, integrated supply chains, and international services that connect their economies and people.</p>

<p>"We need to work together on issues like safety, we need to share ideas and share innovations, especially in how to safely incorporate some of these new technologies into our airspace," he said.</p>

<p>Noting that the two countries have different systems that will take different approaches to solving challenges, he said, "We can and should work together to share best practices and learn from one another." "We all have an interest in increasing safety within our respective countries, but we must work together to increase the level of safety in the global aviation system," he added.</p>

<p>"This means sharing data. Sharing information allows us to better identify and mitigate risks before those risks become accidents and even before they become failures to the safety layers in our system," he added.</p>

<p>"When I started in aviation, accidents were unfortunately not uncommon. They were almost annual events, and safety regulators learned from those accidents and made the system safer," he said.</p>

<p>"For the past couple of decades, we've moved beyond that model, and accidents are now extremely rare, and they are simply unacceptable as an outcome," Whitaker said.</p>

<p>"Our challenge is to bring safety to the next level, and that means we need to proactively analyse data and find those risks of failure and mitigate those risks before they happen," he said.</p>

<p>Asserting that all the job categories in the aviation sector are highly sought after, he said that "for regulators, it means new questions about how we oversee those operations".</p>

<p>"We have to find a safe yet nimble way to regulate these new entrants who are operating at the speed of a startup while we are operating at the speed of government, he said.</p>

<p>He added that there is a need to figure out how to close the gap, identify these risks and leverage technology to incorporate them safely into the airspace.</p>

<p>"In the US, we've seen the public perception of safety and risk in the system evolve over time. As more people have access to aviation, the expectation grows that the system will be completely safe," he asserted.<br />

<p>Mr Musk's reaction came after a recent crash in Orange County, California, where a Tesla driver was reportedly speeding and crashed, causing the vehicle to flip into oncoming traffic, reported KTLA News.</p>

<p>Three people, including the Tesla driver, were hospitalised; their conditions were not immediately available.</p>

<p>Witnesses said the Tesla driver was driving at an estimated over 100 miles per hour. The crash involved six vehicles, with two overturning and trapping people inside. First responders extricated the victims, including the Tesla driver, and rushed them to the hospital.</p>

<p>An eye witness, who was waiting at a red light, recalled the car approaching at "over 100 miles" per hour.</p>

<p>"She smacked the cars right next to me. I don't know how she missed me," the witness said, stressing that the Tesla driver caused the crash.</p>

<p>A worker heard the tyres screech and saw the crash unfold. Recounting the "scary" experience, he said, "Cars are flipping over right outside the window, and it takes you a little bit out of reality."</p>

<p>Police are investigating the cause of the crash, saying it was possible that alcohol or drugs could also be involved.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US has reaffirmed its commitment to partnering with the Maldives to promote a free, open, secure, and prosperous Indo-Pacific region, a senior state department official has said, amidst the archipelagic nation in the Indian Ocean moving closer to China.</p>

<p>This message was conveyed when US Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with visiting Maldivian Foreign Minister Moosa Zameer on Tuesday in Washington, DC.</p>

<p>Secretary Blinken reaffirmed the US commitment to partnering with Maldives to promote a free, open, secure, and prosperous Indo-Pacific region, state department spokesperson Matthew Miller said.</p>

<p>Ever since Maldivian leader Mohamed Muizzu, known for his pro-China leanings, assumed charge as President in November last year, the Maldives has stepped up ties with Beijing and inked several bilateral agreements, including a defence cooperation deal.</p>

<p>Blinken's reference to the Indo-Pacific is also significant since China is vehemently opposed to the US and other countries getting involved in a region where Beijing has major maritime territorial disputes with countries such as the Philippines and Vietnam.</p>

<p>Blinken highlighted the US donation of eight patrol boats to the Maldives and, working with Congress, the planned provision of $2 million in hydrographic support to help the country mitigate the impact of rising sea levels, Miller said in a statement.</p>

<p>Blinken and Zameer discussed additional opportunities to enhance cooperation on addressing the climate crisis, economic growth, maritime security, and other bilateral priorities, it said.</p>

<p>In Male, the foreign ministry said Zameer and Blinken discussed matters in the area of defence and security cooperation, commitment to economic growth and adapting to climate change among other issues and expressed their commitment to regional stability and maritime security.</p>

<p>"Met with Maldivian Foreign Minister @MoosaZameer to enhance the US-Maldives partnership and cooperation on climate, economic growth, and maritime security," posted Blinken on his X handle with the photos of the meeting.</p>

<p>Almost echoing the sentiment, Zameer posted on his X handle, "I am delighted to meet with the Honourable @SecBlinken, Secretary of State of the US, today. I reaffirmed our commitment to further strengthen the partnership between the Maldives and US in tackling climate change, promoting democracy and cooperation in maritime security."</p>

<p>A statement from the Maldives Foreign Ministry said that the Maldives and the United States reaffirmed their commitment to explore new avenues "to strengthen the partnership" and acknowledged the importance of upholding a rules-based international order and expressed their commitment to regional stability, maritime security and promoting peace.</p>

<p>"Secretary Blinken congratulated the Maldives on the successful Presidential and Parliamentary elections and acknowledged the Maldives' leadership in the international fora towards combating climate change and promoting environmental sustainability," the statement said.</p>

<p>News portal Sun.mv said that earlier on Tuesday, Zameer met with Samantha Power, the Administrator of the US Agency for International Development (USAID).</p>

<p>"The two deliberated on various themes related to economical advancements and protecting the environment in addition to consolidating Maldivian associations with the agency's assistance," Edition.mv said.</p>

<p>Zameer had left for Washington on Sunday night, in a visit that the Foreign Ministry said seeks to "further strengthen the Maldives - US partnership and reaffirm commitment to multilateralism," Sun.mv said.</p>

<p>Zameer will also travel to New York, where he will meet with the UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and the UN Under-Secretary-General for Economic and Social Affairs, Li Junhua, media reports said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

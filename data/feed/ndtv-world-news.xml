<p>Even before the assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump, American politics was churning. But after the dramatic developments of last week, it's spinning in a way few could have foreseen. Even as President Joe Biden is getting weaker by the day, Trump seems to be gaining an unstoppable momentum. As per internal polling of the Democrats, Biden is losing ground to Trump in 14 key states, including the five that Biden won in 2020 - &nbsp;Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. His numbers are shaky in Colorado, Minnesota, Maine, New Mexico, Virginia and New Hampshire after his disastrous debate performance.</p>

<p>The Democratic Party remains badly divided with growing fears among its rank and file that, in light of the debate, Biden is in no position to defeat Trump and that he will leave other Democrats on the ballot in November vulnerable too. Voices are growing within the Party asking Biden to step aside, with senior party officials like Rep. Adam Schiff of California making an open case that "a second Trump presidency will undermine the very foundation of our democracy, and I have serious concerns about whether the President can defeat Donald Trump in November". Biden is fighting back but is struggling in convincing his own party about his suitability for the top job.</p>

<h2><strong>The GOP Convention</strong></h2>

<p>His opponent, meanwhile, is basking in the glory of a convention where his past critics are now coming together to anoint him as the party's nominee more formally. All those like Nikki Haley, Ron DeSantis and Marco Rubio, who till a few months back were targeting Trump at the Republican primaries, have now ended up endorsing him unequivocally. Trump with a bandage over his ears and his supporters shouting "Fight, fight, fight!" at the Republican National Convention is a powerful imagery for a nation that a few days back was debating the suitability of a candidate who incited the January 6 insurrection at Capitol Hill. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The confusion in the Republican party was apparent when after J.D. Vance, a former Never Trumper who had, in 2016, wondered whether Trump might be "America's Hitler", was confirmed as the Republican Party's vice presidential nominee. He faced racist attacks from far-right commentators because of his wife's Indian heritage. The upholders of the 'Make America Great Again' movement are finding it difficult to reconcile Vance's multicultural family with their core agenda of anti-immigration.</p>

<h2><strong>Fundamental Challenges</strong></h2>

<p>Political polarisation in the US has led to some fundamental challenges being faced by both the Republicans and the Democrats. The demonisation of the other side has led to a situation where even after an assassination attempt, vitriol continues to flow and there is no attempt at reconciliation.</p>

<p>Though the theme of the Republican convention this week is about unity, there is no place in today's Republican rank and file for those who have a different vision for the US than Trump's. Any challenge to Trump is about challenging the party as the former president has ensured that the Republican Party today is more reflective of his views than a broad tent organisation.</p>

<p>After the assassination attempt on Trump, Vance wrote: "Today is not just some isolated incident. The central premise of the Biden campaign is that President Donald Trump is an authoritarian fascist who must be stopped at all costs. That rhetoric led directly to President Trump's attempted assassination." Trump's own role in vitiating the political climate in the US has been conveniently forgotten by his supporters.</p>

<p>Though President Biden called on the Americans last week to rein in the political debate, arguing that "[It] must never be a battlefield and, God forbid, a killing field", and warning that "no matter how strong our convictions, we must never descend into violence", it's not readily evident who is listening. Trump's ability to tap into the sense of grievance and persecution felt by middle America has thwarted any attempt by the Biden administration and the Democrats more generally to craft a political narrative that can shift the momentum in their favour. And now after the attack on Trump, it has become even more difficult as the image of a defiant former President with blood streaked across his face stands in stark contrast to a fumbling feeble Biden unable to articulate a coherent thought.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
November is still far away. Even a day is a long time in politics. The Democratic Party can still regroup and present a serious challenge to Trump. But there is no denying the fact that the last two weeks have upended the US Presidential elections in fundamental ways and will leave a strong mark on American politics whichever way the political winds blow in the coming days.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden, who has tested positive for Covid for a third time, was reportedly been told by former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi that he could destroy the Democrats' chances of winning elections in November, due to his age.</p>

<p>The 81-year-old President has responded to Pelosi that he still has a chance of winning the presidential race, according to a report by CNN. One of their sources has mentioned Biden getting defensive about the upcoming polls in response.</p>

<p>The California Representative had reportedly asked Biden's Senior Advisor Mike Donilon to connect her with the President on a call, which would mark the second conversation between the two since Biden's poor performance in the debate with Donald Trump.</p>

<p>Although Pelosi seems to have stopped fully backing Biden, it is not known yet whether she thinks that he should withdraw from the race altogether. In an interview last week, she said, "It's up to the president to decide if he is going to run. We're all encouraging him to make that decision because time is running short."</p>

<p>On the other hand, she took to social media platform X (formerly Twitter) after the assassination attempt on Trump, writing, "As one whose family has been the victim of political violence, I know first-hand that political violence of any kind has no place in our society. I thank God that former President Trump is safe."</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">As one whose family has been the victim of political violence, I know firsthand that political violence of any kind has no place in our society. I thank God that former President Trump is safe.<br />
<br />
As we learn more details about this horrifying incident, let us pray that all those…</p>
— Nancy Pelosi (@SpeakerPelosi) <a href="https://twitter.com/SpeakerPelosi/status/1812268746574020870?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 13, 2024</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>A Pelosi spokesperson has also reportedly told CNN that she has not spoken to Biden since Friday.</p>

<p>One of the Democratic Party's leading fundraisers, actor George Clooney had said last week that Biden cannot win against time. Clooney said, "Top Democrats -- Chuck Schumer, Hakeem Jeffries, Nancy Pelosi -- and senators, representatives and other candidates who face losing in November need to ask this president to voluntarily step aside."</p>

<p>Biden had recently slammed Trump for joking about Pelosi's husband being attacked with a hammer, by a far-right conspiracy theorist in 2022, when she was the House Speaker.</p>

<p>"If I had some medical condition that emerged, if somebody, if the doctors came and said 'you've got this problem, that problem,'" Biden told the Black media outlet BET in an interview on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Biden testing positive for Covid today, amid pressure for him to withdraw from the White House race due to his age and mental acuity, makes the situation all the more tense in an already polarised nation ahead of the elections in November.</p>

<p>The instance of Biden mistakenly referring to Vice President Kamala Harris as Trump at his solo press conference has also added to doubts over his fitness as the US Presidential Candidate due to his age.</p>

<p>The last two weeks, especially after his disastrous performance in the presidential debate with Trump have seen Biden standing at a chance of losing celebrity support and key endorsers such as Teamsters. Meanwhile, Trump has regained the support of some of his key rivals including Nikki Haley, Ron DeSantis, and Vivek Ramaswamy at the Republican Convention following his assassination bid.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden has tested positive for Covid-19. The diagnosis, which came with mild symptoms, has been leveraged by his campaign team to target his principal political rival Donald Trump and tech billionaire Elon Musk.</p>

<p>The 81-year-old Democrat, who is currently isolated at his beach home in Delaware, took to social media to announce his diagnosis, quipping "I'm sick" before following up with a tongue-in-cheek remark aimed at Musk and his wealthy associates, accusing them of attempting to "buy this election."</p>

<p>Musk has pledged roughly $45 million each month to a new fund backing Trump for US president.</p>

<p>President Biden's health issues have raised concerns about his fitness for office, particularly among Democrats. A recent poll conducted by the Associated Press and NORC Center for Public Affairs Research indicated that nearly two-thirds of respondents believe Biden should step down.</p>

<p>The president's illness has also sparked a heated debate within the Democratic Party, with prominent figures like Representative Adam Schiff and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi urging Biden to "pass the torch. Democratic Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries have reportedly expressed concerns to Biden that his candidacy may jeopardise the party's electoral prospects.</p>

<p>Despite these developments, Biden remains adamant in his pursuit of reelection insisting that Democratic voters support him. &nbsp;White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre assured the public that Biden, who is vaccinated and boosted, continues to fulfil his presidential duties while in isolation. Dr Kevin O'Connor, Biden's physician, confirmed that the president's symptoms remain mild.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>South Korea's supreme court on Thursday upheld a ruling that a same-sex partner was eligible for spousal benefits from state health insurance, a move hailed as a win for LGBTQ rights in a country that has lagged others in the region.</p>

<p>The court confirmed a landmark decision by the Seoul High Court early last year that the National Health Insurance Service should provide equal spousal coverage to So Sung-wook and Kim Yong-min - a gay couple who filed a suit in 2021 against the agency after it cancelled their spousal benefits.</p>

<p>"I couldn't believe when I heard the ruling. I was extremely happy and I started crying," Kim told Reuters outside the court.</p>

<p>"It took four years to earn this dependent status," he said. "We need to fight harder to legalize same-sex marriage going forward."</p>

<p>Chief Justice Jo Hee-de said that denying the couple benefits, even though there are no clauses in the National Health Insurance Act that specifically refer to same-sex unions, constituted discrimination based on sexual orientation.</p>

<p>"It is an act of discrimination that violates human dignity and value, the right to pursue happiness, freedom of privacy and the right to equality before the law, and the degree of violation is serious," Judge Jo told a televised trial.</p>

<p>So Kim refer to themselves as a married couple, but their marriage is not legally recognised in South Korea.</p>

<p>Lawyers and advocates said the ruling marks the first legal recognition of same-sex unions.</p>

<p>"With this ruling today, the legal status of same-sex couples will be recognised in the public system, so I think the existence of same-sex couples will become more visible," Chang Suh-yeon, one of the lawyers who represented the couple, told reporters.</p>

<p>While campaigns to legalize same-sex marriage have succeeded in Taiwan and Thailand, there is no legal acknowledgement of LGBTQ partnerships in South Korea, forcing couples to move abroad if they want to get married legally.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court's ruling is a "stepping stone for progress" towards marriage equality, said Horim Yi, an activist at the LGBTQ campaign group Marriage For All.</p>

<p>"It's going to be a very hopeful ruling for same-sex couples living in South Korea," Yi said.</p>

<p>Last year, the couple told Reuters they were being open about their story to help "change people's opinions and help other LGBTQ people like us gather up the courage".</p>

<p>Conservative religious groups in South Korea have mounted fierce resistance to efforts to pass laws promoting LGBTQ rights, prompting many people to hide their identity in the workplace as they struggle for equal recognition and acceptance.</p>

<p>Ahead of the ruling, members of conservative Christian groups held a rally outside the court, waving a banner reading "Same-sex families are nonsense. Supreme Court, overturn the Seoul High Court's ruling!"</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[AI drone development in Ukraine is broadly split between visual systems helping identify targets and fly drones into them, terrain mapping for navigation, and more complex programmes enabling UAVs to operate in interconnected "swarms"]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In Ukraine, a handful of startups are developing Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems to help fly a vast fleet of drones, taking warfare into uncharted territory as combatants race to gain a technological edge in battle.</p>

<p>Ukraine hopes a rollout of AI-enabled drones across the front line will help it overcome increasing signal jamming by the Russians as well as enable unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to work in larger groups.</p>

<p>AI drone development in Ukraine is broadly split between visual systems helping identify targets and fly drones into them, terrain mapping for navigation, and more complex programmes enabling UAVs to operate in interconnected "swarms".</p>

<p>One company working on this is Swarmer, which is developing software that links drones in a network. Decisions can be implemented instantly across the group, with a human only stepping in to green-light automated strikes.</p>

<p>"When you try to scale up (with human pilots), it just doesn't work," Swarmer CEO Serhiy Kupriienko told Reuters in the company's Kyiv offices. "For a swarm of 10 or 20 drones or robots, it's virtually impossible for humans to manage them."</p>

<p>Swarmer is one of more than 200 tech firms that have sprung up since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in 2022, with civilians from IT backgrounds developing drones and other devices to help Ukraine counter a much larger enemy.</p>

<p>Kupriienko said that while human pilots struggled to run operations involving more than five drones, AI would be able to process hundreds.</p>

<p>The system, called Styx, directs a web of reconnaissance and strike drones, both large and small, in the air and on the ground. Every drone would be able to plan its own moves and predict the behaviour of the others in the swarm, he said.</p>

<p>As well as scaling up operations, Kupriienko said automation would help protect drone pilots who operate close to the front lines and are a priority target for enemy fire.</p>

<p>Swarmer's technology is still under development and has only been trialled on the battlefield experimentally, he added.</p>

<p>Samuel Bendett, Adjunct Senior Fellow at the Center for a New American Security, said AI drone control systems would likely need a human in the loop to prevent the system making errors in target selection.</p>

<p>There are broad concerns about the ethics of weapons that exclude human judgment. A 2020 European Parliament research paper warned that such systems could commit violations of international humanitarian law and lower the threshold of going to war.</p>

<p>AI is already being used in some of Ukraine's long-range drone strikes which target military facilities and oil refineries hundreds of kilometres inside Russia.</p>

<p>One Ukrainian official, speaking anonymously, told Reuters that the attacks sometimes involve a swarm of about 20 drones.</p>

<p>The core drones fly to the target, but it is the job of others to take out or distract air defences along the way. To do this, they use a form of AI with human oversight to help spot targets or threats and plan possible routes, the source added.</p>

<h3><strong>SIGNAL JAMMING</strong></h3>

<p>The need for AI-enabled drones is becoming more pressing as both sides roll out Electronic Warfare (EW) systems that disrupt signals between pilots and drones.</p>

<p>Small, cheap, FPV (first person view) drones in particular, which became the main way for both sides to hit enemy vehicles in 2023, are seeing their hit rates fall as jamming increases.</p>

<p>"We are already working with the concept that in the near future, there will be no connection on the front line" between pilot and UAV, said Max Makarchuk, the AI lead for Brave1, a defence tech accelerator set up by the Ukrainian government.</p>

<p>According to Makarchuk, the percentage of FPVs that hit their target is constantly falling. Most FPV units now see a strike rate of 30-50%, while for new pilots that can be as low as 10%.</p>

<p>He predicted that AI-operated FPV drones could post hit rates of around 80%.</p>

<p>To counter the EW threat, makers including Swarmer have started developing functions which allow a drone to lock onto a target through its camera.</p>

<p>EW systems form an invisible signal-jamming dome over the equipment and soldiers which they protect.</p>

<p>If a pilot's contact with the drone is cut, they can no longer control it and the craft either plummets to the ground or continues flying straight on.</p>

<p>Automating the final part of a drone's flight to its target means that it no longer needs the pilot - thus nullifying the effect of the EW's jamming.</p>

<p>AI-enabled drones have been in development for years but had hitherto been seen as expensive and experimental.</p>

<p>Bendett said Russia had been developing AI-enabled aerial and ground drones before the 2022 invasion and had claimed some successes.</p>

<p>In Ukraine, the key task for manufacturers is to produce an AI targeting system for drones which is cheap. That would allow it to be deployed en masse along the entire 1,000 km (621 mile) front line, where thousands of FPV drones are used up each week.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After obliterating his Republican rivals, becoming the first former president convicted of a crime, and surviving an assassination attempt, Donald Trump caps off a crazy year with his coronation as the Republican Party's presidential nominee.</p>

<h3><strong>Trump the victor&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>From the first night of the 2024 primaries -- the Iowa caucuses -- Donald Trump dominated the competition.</p>

<p>The former president was thought to be in political trouble just a few months earlier given his mounting legal problems, but he easily clinched victory in the Midwest state.</p>

<p>Though several Republican hopefuls had campaigned across the state's rural agricultural landscape, Trump walked away with victories in 98 of Iowa's 99 counties.</p>

<p>The only one who stayed in the race after that night was Nikki Haley, the former UN ambassador and South Carolina governor.</p>

<p>Though she tried to define herself as a moderate alternative to Trump, she eventually dropped out in early March after Trump claimed more than a dozen primary victories on "Super Tuesday."</p>

<h3><strong>Trump the convict&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>After weeks spent in court during his highly publicized hush money trial, Trump was found guilty on May 30 on 34 counts of falsifying business records to cover up payments made to a former porn star.</p>

<p>The historic verdict was a blow to Trump, who became the only former president to have been convicted on criminal charges.</p>

<p>Sentencing in the case had been scheduled for July 11, but a recent ruling by the Supreme Court regarding presidential immunity has delayed the hearing until the fall.</p>

<h3><strong>Trump the survivor&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>On July 13, Trump was on stage for a campaign rally in Pennsylvania when shots rang out.</p>

<p>A 20-year-old man had climbed onto the roof of a nearby building and aimed for the former president, who was wounded in his right ear.</p>

<p>As spectators ducked on the ground, the US Secret Service rushed to protect Trump, who raised his fist in the air with blood dripping down his face.</p>

<p>Photos of the scene immediately spread around the globe.</p>

<h3><strong>Trump the nominee&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Less than 24 hours after the attempt on his life, Trump landed in Milwaukee for the Republican National Convention.</p>

<p>Unlike the chaos of the 2016 convention, however, Trump reigns as the head of his party, with former rivals spending all week singing his praises on stage.</p>

<p>On Thursday, Trump will accept the Republican nomination for president in the November general election, which, according to polls, he is well on the way to winning -- the culmination of a landmark year.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Caden Schaefer-Rose will only just be 18 by the time of November's US election, but he is determined to cast his very first presidential vote -- for Donald Trump.</p>

<p>The high school student is among a growing number of teens defying liberal stereotypes of America's youngest voters and hopping aboard the Trump train.</p>

<p>"I feel like he reflects a lot of my personal values," Schaefer-Rose, wearing mirrored sunglasses, told AFP at a "Youth VoteFest" Wednesday near the Republican National Convention.</p>

<p>He first became aware of Trump in 2016, seeing him on television during that year's raucous campaign. Other young voters at the event said their first memory of Trump was seeing his cameo in "Home Alone 2," or as a brash boss in television's "The Apprentice."</p>

<p>"I kind of just connected with him," Schaefer-Rose said. "I was only eight years old at the time, but I could see that he was someone I could eventually look up to."</p>

<p>Same with Matthew Paley, a New Jersey 19-year-old who was playing corn hole outside the Republican convention arena.</p>

<p class="ins_instory_dv_caption"><span class="ins_instory_span_credit">19-year-old Mathey Paley said he loves Trump's fight for what he believes in. Photo Credit: AFP</span></p>
</div>

<p>He met his idol Trump -- "very nice dude!" -- recently in Florida and fully backs the billionaire as he seeks a White House comeback.</p>

<p>"Honestly in the beginning... I just liked Trump because I thought he was hilarious," said Paley.</p>

<p>"Then once I started doing my research, I was like 'Oh wow, alright.'"</p>

<p>Paley said he embraces the same "core conservative values" as Trump, including gun rights.</p>

<p>"And I love that he has such a strong backbone and fights for what he believes in."</p>

<p>America's youth have traditionally voted Democratic, and for now they largely still do. But Republicans insist a shift is afoot.</p>

<p>Pew Research shows that in 2016, voters under 30 supported the Democratic Party ticket by a 30-point margin. By 2020, that advantage shrank to 24 points.</p>

<p>The youngest voters in particular are pivotal, as studies show college student voting is rising -- and Republicans are courting them like never before.</p>

<p>Trump's newly announced running mate, J.D. Vance, is just 39 years old, 20 years younger than Vice President Kamala Harris.</p>

<p>The party invited Amber Rose, a social media influencer with 24 million followers on Instagram, to address the convention, where she endorsed Trump Monday.</p>

<p>And in a bid to attract young Black voters, rapper Forgiato Blow made an appearance.</p>

<h3><strong>'Limit your dreams'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Charlie Kirk, who founded the youth-oriented grassroots conservative group Turning Point USA when he was just 18, took the convention stage this week claiming Biden's message to Gen Z is to "limit your dreams (and) be content with less."</p>

<p>"Donald Trump refuses to accept this fake, pathetic, mutilated version of the American dream," Kirk, 30, said to huge applause.</p>

<p>"This is why young men are the most conservative that they have been in 50 years."</p>

<p>Xavier Starks, an African-American high schooler in Wisconsin who turns 18 in August, said he is considering voting for Trump.</p>

<p>"I feel like Trump did do good things, but the way he's trying to run and saying 'I'm a dictator,' and how he's going to conduct himself, I don't know about that," Starks told AFP at the youth symposium.</p>

<p>The fact a convicted felon will be on the ballot is "pretty insane," he said. But Biden, 81, is "so old."</p>

<p>Well-informed young conservatives cite America's soaring national debt, shrinking home ownership prospects, bloated interest rates, and illegal immigration as reasons to back Trump.</p>

<p>Former US senator Heidi Heitkamp, who now heads the University of Chicago's Institute of Politics which coordinated the VoteFest, said she recognizes why young Americans might tune out to the two oldest-ever presidential nominees.</p>

<p>"I think they're looking at these two candidates and saying, 'Do they really understand what my concerns are?'" she said.</p>

<p>"I don't think there's been a lot of clarity on what that future looks like for young people."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Usha, born to immigrant parents from Andhra Pradesh, shared their story from the stage of the RNC. Recounting their first meeting and the journey that led them to this moment, she said “There was only one thing to do, to explain, from the heart, why I love and admire JD, why I stand here beside him today, and why he will make a great Vice President of the United States.”<br />
<br />
She shared how they met at the law school, where JD was a "working-class student" who had "overcome childhood traumas" and served in Iraq as a Marine. "A tough Marine who had served in Iraq but whose idea of a good time was playing with puppies," she said.<br />
<br />
Usha shed light on the Ohio senator's curious and enthusiastic approach to their differences when they first met, including his adaptation to her vegetarian diet and learning to cook Indian food from her mother. “Although he is a meat and potato kind of guy, he adapted to my vegetarian diet and learnt to cook Indian food from my mother,” she said.<br />
<br />
JD and Usha Vance met at Yale Law School and married in 2014. The couple has three children together – Ewan, 6, Vivek, 4, and Mirabel, 2.<br />
<br />
JD Vance also delivered a powerful speech at the RNC, talking about his roots in small-town Ohio and the economic challenges communities across the Rust Belt faced. He spoke about the struggles of small towns in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan and other states, where jobs have been sent overseas and children have been sent to war.<br />
<br />
He vowed to be a champion for these forgotten communities, promising to never forget his humble beginnings. “I promise you this: I will be a vice president who never forgets where he came from," JD said.<br />
<br />
"To the people of Middletown, Ohio, and all the forgotten communities in Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Ohio, and every corner of our nation, I will fight for you, I will stand with you, and I will never forget the struggles we face."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Florida man was shot dead by a Polk County Sheriff's deputy after a bizarre sequence of events that began with a melted Almond Joy candy bar.</p>

<p>Nineteen-year-old Henry Maynard's grandmother had brought the candy bar for him but found him fast asleep. So, she left it on his laptop.</p>

<p>When Maynard woke up, the candy had melted, and he "went into a rage," said Sheriff Grady Judd in a video statement.<br />
<br />
<iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NKnnE4gbwn8?si=7jpEfe60OXt7IvMf" title="YouTube video player" width="560"></iframe></p>

<p>Maynard ran almost a mile to his parents' house, grabbed a car, and started driving without having a license or registration.</p>

<p>The grandmother quickly called Maynard's parents, warning them that he was in a rage and in the car. As the situation unfolded, Maynard's parents and a deputy arrived at the scene near Oakwood Estates in Winter Haven.</p>

<p>According to Sheriff Judd, Maynard's actions became increasingly erratic and violent. "He was out of control," the sheriff claimed.</p>

<p>Maynard also called 911, saying he was about to commit a crime. He followed through, reversing his car, knocking over his grandmother, and then accelerating forward, crashing into the deputy's vehicle in a T-bone collision.</p>

<p>A witness described him as acting "like a madman" as he tried to enter the police vehicle and started climbing inside. The situation escalated, and Deputy Christian Quattlebaum was forced to shoot Maynard, who died on the spot.</p>

<p>Maynard couldn't be saved, even after his father's efforts to perform CPR on him.</p>

<p>This wasn't Maynard's first run-in with the law. He was previously arrested for aggravated battery of a law enforcement officer.</p>

<p>Fortunately, Maynard's 81-year-old grandmother is recovering in the hospital with a broken arm. Despite the chaos, she is in stable condition.</p>

<p>The deputy was treated for injuries and the incident is being investigated by the 10th Judicial Circuit's Officer Involved Deadly Incident (OIDI) Task Force.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Indian High Commission in Dhaka has issued an urgent advisory for Indian citizens and students in Bangladesh to avoid non-essential travel and minimise movement outside their residences due to the escalating unrest in the country.</p>

<p>The advisory comes in response to recent violent clashes between students and police in Dhaka, following the Bangladeshi government's decision to close all public and private universities.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Advisory on the ongoing situation in Bangladesh. <a href="https://t.co/nSMsw9hWp0">pic.twitter.com/nSMsw9hWp0</a></p>
— India in Bangladesh (@ihcdhaka) <a href="https://twitter.com/ihcdhaka/status/1813822051259658497?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 18, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p>The protests have been driven by demands for reform of the country's quota system for civil service jobs, which reserves positions for specific groups, including descendants of those who participated in the 1971 war of independence against Pakistan.</p>

<p>On Thursday, protests intensified as students clashed with law enforcement in various locations across Dhaka. In Merul Badda, near Brac University, demonstrators blocked roads and engaged in violent confrontations with police, resulting in multiple injuries. By late morning, police deployed tear gas to disperse the crowd, leading to significant traffic disruptions in the area, Dhaka Tribune reported.</p>

<p>Additionally, students obstructed the entrance to the Bashundhara Residential Area on Pragati Sarani and blocked the Dhaka-Chittagong highway in Jatrabari, severely affecting public transportation and causing widespread inconvenience. The Mirpur 10 roundabout and surrounding areas also experienced a heavy police presence, with many local markets and shops remaining closed.</p>

<p>The protests began in response to perceived police brutality and have evolved into a broader demand for justice for those injured or killed in previous demonstrations, as well as a call for a violence-free campus and rational reform of the quota system, as reported by Dhaka Tribune.</p>

<p>In light of the volatile situation, the High Commission of India in Dhaka and the Indian Assistant High Commissions in Chittagong, Sylhet, and Khulna have established 24-hour emergency contact numbers for Indian nationals and students who require assistance:</p>

<p>High Commission of India, Dhaka: 880-1937400591 (also on WhatsApp)</p>

<p>Assistant High Commission of India, Chittagong: 880-1814654797 / 880-1814654799 (also on WhatsApp)</p>

<p>Assistant High Commission of India, Sylhet: 880-1313076411 (also on WhatsApp)</p>

<p>Assistant High Commission of India, Khulna: 880-1812817799 (also on WhatsApp)</p>

<p>The recent protests have been fueled by dissatisfaction with Bangladesh's quota system, which sets aside a significant number of civil service positions for specific groups. This system has been a contentious issue in Bangladesh for years, with current demonstrations reflecting deep-seated frustrations over both the quota system and the response of law enforcement to peaceful student movements.</p>

<p>The Indian government continues to monitor the situation and advises all citizens in Bangladesh to adhere to the travel advisory and reach out to the High Commission or Assistant High Commissions if they are in need of urgent assistance.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bangladesh students vowed Thursday to continue nationwide protests against civil service hiring rules, rebuffing an olive branch from Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina who pledged justice for seven killed in the demonstrations.</p>

<p>Hasina's government has ordered schools and universities to close indefinitely and stepped up efforts to contain weeks of rallies demanding equal access to public sector jobs.</p>

<p>Riot police have fired tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse crowds while protesters and students allied to the premier's ruling Awami League have battled on the streets with bricks and bamboo rods.</p>

<p>Hasina condemned the "murder" of protesters in a televised address to the nation and vowed that those responsible will be punished regardless of their political affiliation.</p>

<p>But Students Against Discrimination, the main group behind this month's rallies, said her words were insincere and urged supporters to press on.</p>

<p>"It did not reflect the murders and mayhem carried out by her party activists," Asif Mahmud, one of the coordinators of the protests, told AFP.</p>

<p>The group called on Bangladeshis to observe a nationwide shutdown Thursday, by keeping shops closed and staying at home ahead of fresh protests planned for later in the day.</p>

<p>The call was widely observed in the capital Dhaka, with barely any vehicles seen on the city's usually traffic-choked roads.</p>

<p>Dhaka residents reported widespread mobile internet outages on Thursday, two days after internet providers cut off access to Facebook -- the protest campaign's key organising tool.</p>

<p>Police on Thursday announced the death of a seventh protester the previous evening, conceding that police weaponry had killed the 18-year-old.</p>

<p>"He was hit by rubber bullets," police inspector Bacchu Mia told AFP. "He was brought to the hospital but died before he was admitted."</p>

<h3><strong>Hundreds injured&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>More than 500 others were injured in clashes around the country on Wednesday, while six people were killed on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Hasina's speech did not assign responsibility for the deaths, but descriptions from hospital authorities and students given to AFP earlier suggest at least some of the victims died when police used supposedly non-lethal weapons on demonstrations.</p>

<p>Rights group Amnesty International said video evidence from clashes this week showed that Bangladeshi security forces had used unlawful force.</p>

<p>Fresh clashes overnight included a battle on Dhaka's outskirts between police and more than 1,000 protesters who set fire to a roadside toll booth.</p>

<p>"We spent the whole night fending off attacks from the protesters," deputy police commissioner Iqbal Hossain told AFP, adding that officers had eventually dispersed the group with rubber bullets and tear gas.</p>

<p>At the heart of the protests are demands to end of a quota system for lucrative government jobs that opponents say unfairly benefits members of Bangladesh's ruling party.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[UK PM Keir Starmer's government said it would seek to establish appropriate legislation to place requirements on those working to develop "the most powerful AI models." Under Sunak, the government avoided introducing targeted AI regulation.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Britain's new Labour government has said it will explore how to effectively regulate artificial intelligence models, but stopped short of proposing any specific laws.</p>

<p>King Charles set out newly-elected Prime Minister Keir Starmer's legislative agenda in a speech on Wednesday to open the new session of parliament. It included more than 35 new bills covering everything from housing to cyber security measures.</p>

<p>The government said it would seek to establish the appropriate legislation to place requirements on those working to develop "the most powerful artificial intelligence models."</p>

<p>The country's last prime minister Rishi Sunak had sought to position Britain as a world leader in AI safety, bringing world leaders and company executives together last November for a summit at Bletchley Park to discuss the issue.</p>

<p>He also oversaw the launch of the world's first AI Safety Institute, which has focused on the capabilities of "frontier" AI models, such as those behind OpenAI's highly successful ChatGPT chatbot.</p>

<p>"AI labs will be collectively breathing a sigh of relief at the government's decision not to rush ahead with frontier model regulation," said Nathan Benaich, founding partner of AI-focused investment group Air Street Capital.</p>

<p>Under Sunak, the government avoided introducing targeted AI regulation, opting instead to split responsibility for scrutinising the technology between various regulators.</p>

<p>Starmer has promised to introduce new laws on AI, but his government is taking a careful approach to rolling them out.</p>

<p>"The UK's cautious, sector-based approach to AI regulation remains a crucial competitive advantage versus the EU, and any moves to change this regime should only be taken with the utmost caution," Benaich said.</p>

<p>But some AI experts say the rapid rollout of AI tools over the past 18 months only makes the need for new legislation more urgent.</p>

<p>Gaia Marcus, director of the Ada Lovelace Institute, said the government should bring forward a bill as soon as possible.</p>

<p>"These systems are already being integrated into our daily lives, our public services and our economy, bringing benefits and opportunity, but also posing a range of risks to people and society," she said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Nearly a quarter of Japanese companies have adopted artificial intelligence (AI) in their businesses, while more than 40% have no plan to make use of the cutting-edge technology]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nearly a quarter of Japanese companies have adopted artificial intelligence (AI) in their businesses, while more than 40% have no plan to make use of the cutting-edge technology, a Reuters survey showed on Thursday.<br />
<br />
The survey, conducted for Reuters by Nikkei Research, pitched a range of questions to 506 companies over July 3-12 with roughly 250 firms responding, on condition of anonymity.</p>

<p>About 24% of respondents said they have already introduced AI in their businesses and 35% are planning to do so, while the remaining 41% have no such plans, illustrating varying degrees of embracing the technological innovation in corporate Japan.</p>

<p>Asked for objectives when adopting AI in a question allowing multiple answers, 60% of respondents said they were trying to cope with a shortage of workers, while 53% aimed to cut labour costs and 36% cited acceleration in research and development.</p>

<p>As for hurdles to introduction, a manager at a transportation company cited "anxiety among employees over possible headcount reduction".</p>

<p>Other obstacles include a lack of technological expertise, substantial capital expenditure and concern about reliability, the survey showed.</p>

<p>The poll also showed 15% of respondents have experienced cyberattacks over the past year and 9% had business partners that suffered cyberattacks during the same period.</p>

<p>Asked about damage, 23% of those that suffered cyberattacks themselves or had business partners that were targets said business was temporarily halted, and 4% said they suffered information leak.</p>

<p>On steps to enhance cybersecurity, 47% of respondents said they were outsourcing defence whereas 38% said they had in-house specialists.</p>

<p>Cyberattack victims in recent months included high-profile publisher Kadokawa whose case prompted the government to work towards strengthening cybersecurity measures.</p>

<p>The survey also showed half of firms support changing a law stipulating that spouses must use the same surname. Women take their husband's in more than 9 out of 10 marriages, a practice opponents said takes away part of a woman's identity and burdens them with the masses of paperwork needed to make the change.</p>

<p>The issue came under renewed spotlight after the Keidanren business lobby last month asked the government to allow married individuals to keep their surnames.</p>

<p>In the survey, 50% of respondents said they supported such legislative change compared with 11% that opposed.</p>

<p>"The current system is hurting individuals' - and especially women's - dignity and freedom," a manager at a machinery firm wrote. An official at a steelmaker called change the "natural demand of the times".</p>

<p>In opposition, a manager at a non-ferrous metal manufacturer said allowing separate surnames could "weaken family bonds."</p>

<p>Asked how a change in the law would affect their business, 14% of respondents said employee morale would be boosted and 10% said it would help hiring activity, while 56% said they expected no impact.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>India is a great power that determines its national interests and chooses its partners, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has said, describing as "completely unjustified" the "enormous pressure" on New Delhi due to its energy cooperation with Moscow.</p>

<p>During a press conference here on Wednesday, Lavrov also termed as "insulting" Ukraine's remarks on the recent meeting between President Vladimir Putin and Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Moscow. "I think India is a great power that sets its own national interests, determines its own national interests, and chooses its own partners. And we know that India is being subject to enormous pressure, completely unjustified pressure in the international arena," Lavrov said.</p>

<p>Lavrov was responding to a question about Prime Minister Modi's recent visit to Moscow and the opposition faced by India for its energy cooperation with Russia. With Russia presiding over the UN Security Council for the month of July, Lavrov is in New York to chair meetings of the Council being held under Moscow's presidency.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Modi paid an official visit to Russia on July 8-9 at the invitation of Russian President Vladimir Putin for the 22nd India - Russia Annual Summit. This was Modi's first trip to Russia since the start of the Ukraine conflict.</p>

<p>India has not yet condemned Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and has consistently pitched for a resolution of the conflict through dialogue and diplomacy.</p>

<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has also criticised Modi's visit to Moscow, saying in a post on X that "A Russian missile struck the largest children's hospital in Ukraine, targeting young cancer patients. Many were buried under the rubble.</p>

<p>"It is a huge disappointment and a devastating blow to peace efforts to see the leader of the world's largest democracy hug the world's most bloody criminal in Moscow on such a day," Zelenskyy had said of the Modi-Putin meeting.</p>

<p>India had conveyed to Kyiv its displeasure over the remarks. It was learnt that India's disappointment over the comments by Zelenskyy was communicated to Ukraine's mission in Delhi.</p>

<p>Referring to Zelenskyy's comments about Modi's trip to Russia being "a stabbing in the back of all peace efforts", Lavrov said, "So that was very insulting and the Ukrainian ambassador was called in" and the Indian Ministry of External Affairs "talked to him about how he should be behaving." "The ambassadors were really behaving as if they were hooligans," he said, referring to remarks made by some other Ukrainian envoys.</p>

<p>"So I think India is doing everything right," he said.</p>

<p>Lavrov noted that External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar, after touring Western nations, answered questions including about why India was buying more oil from Russia.</p>

<p>Lavrov said Jaishankar cited statistics that showed that the West has also increased its purchases of gas and oil from Russia, despite some of the restrictions that have been imposed.</p>

<p>Lavrov said Jaishankar "went on to say that India will decide for itself how to trade with whom and how to defend its national interests." "But the fact that the West is exhibiting its displeasure to powers - powers like China, like India - well, it shows their lack of erudition, their inability to partake in diplomacy, and also speak to the failure of political analysts. Because speaking this way, to these great Asian powers... you might dream of that but it's really beneath them. It's really beneath them behaving this way vis-a-vis any and all countries but in particular when they're speaking in this way to these two giants, these two great powers." On India's oil purchases from Russia, Jaishankar earlier said that it is his duty to put the interest of the Indian people first to ensure that they do not pay the cost of some other countries' actions or some other region's actions for fertilizer, food, etc.</p>

<p>"It's not just that we buy oil from one country. We buy oil from multiple sources, but it is a sensible policy to go where we get the best deal in the interests of the Indian people and that is exactly what we are trying to do," Jaishankar has said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Meta Platforms said on Wednesday it decided to suspend use of generative artificial intelligence tools in Brazil in response to the government's objections to its new privacy policy regarding personal data and AI.<br />
<br />
<strong>WHY IT'S IMPORTANT</strong></h3>

<p>With more than 200 million people, Brazil is a crucial market for Meta. For example, Brazil has the second-largest user base for Meta's WhatsApp after India.</p>

<p>In June, Meta hosted an event in Sao Paulo to launch its first AI-driven ad targeting program for businesses on the popular chat service.</p>

<h3><strong>CONTEXT</strong></h3>

<p>Earlier this month, Brazil's National Data Protection Authority (ANPD) decided to suspend with immediate effect the validity of Meta's new privacy policy for the use of personal data to train generative artificial intelligence systems in the country.</p>

<p>ANPD ruled that the company would need to adapt its privacy policy to exclude the section related to the processing of personal data for generative AI training, according to the Brazilian authority.</p>

<h3><strong>KEY QUOTE</strong></h3>

<p>In a statement, Meta said it has decided to suspend the tools while it is in talks with ANPD to address the authority's doubts over generative artificial intelligence.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former US President Donald Trump's granddaughter Kai Trump took to the stage at the Republican National Convention on Wednesday night to share personal stories about her grandfather. With a proud smile, the Republican presidential nominee listened to the 17-year-old, who described him as a "normal grandpa", spoiling her and her siblings with "candy and soda" when their parents weren't looking.</p>

<p>Kai, the eldest of Trump's 10 grandchildren, claimed she wanted to show the country a side of her grandfather that they "don't often see".</p>

<p>“He always wants to know how we're doing in school,” she <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2024/jul/17/kai-trump-talks-all-about-grandpa-trump-at-republi/ ">said</a>.</p>

<p>Kai shared a heartwarming moment when she made the high honour roll, and her grandfather "printed it out to show his friends how proud he was" of her.</p>

<p>The 17-year-old, the daughter of Donald Trump Jr and his ex-wife, Vanessa Trump, revealed that he often calls her during school to ask about her golf game and shares stories about his own. Kai joked that she has to remind him she's "in school and can't talk."</p>

<p>When they play golf together, Trump tries to get inside her head, but Kai says she doesn't let him get to her. "I remind him, I'm a Trump too," she said with a smile.</p>

<p>Despite his busy schedule, including ongoing court cases, Kai said her grandfather always asks about her well-being and encourages her to push herself to be successful. "Obviously, he sets the bar pretty high, but who knows, maybe one day I will catch him," she said confidently.</p>

<p>Later, Kai shared that she was "shocked" after the recent assassination attempt on her grandfather at a Pennsylvania rally. "A lot of people have put my grandpa through hell, and he's still standing," she stated. Affectionately addressing him, she said, "Grandpa, you are such an inspiration, and I love you."</p>

<p>She also addressed the media's portrayal of her grandfather, saying that they make her "grandpa seem like a different person". "But I know him for who he is," she said. "He's very caring and loving. He truly wants the best for this country, and he will fight every single day to make America great again."</p>

<p>Kai Trump has been a frequent presence at Donald Trump's side during various events over the years. She has been spotted at key events such as his inauguration, the announcement of his candidacy in 2015, and the opening of a Trump golf course. Kai has also been seen at golf tournaments and holidays with her grandfather. Her most recent appearances include attending UFC 303 with her father and playing in the ProAm of the LIV Golf Team Championship at the Trump National Doral Golf Club in 2022.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fourteen students were rushed to the hospital on Tuesday after experiencing nausea, stomach pain, and mouth pain from consuming extremely spicy potato chips at Rokugo Koka High School, according to <em>Japan Today.</em></p>

<p>As per <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://japantoday.com/category/national/14-tokyo-students-taken-to-hospital-after-eating-spicy-chips">the news report,</a> the chips, labelled "18+ Curry Chips," were brought to school by a student and shared among a group of about 30 classmates. All the affected students are first-year students and are believed to have only minor symptoms.</p>

<p>The chips are manufactured by Isoyama Corporation, a company based in Ibaraki Prefecture. The company advises against people under 18 consuming their product due to its spiciness and warns spice lovers to exercise caution when eating them. The chips reportedly contain ghost peppers, one of the hottest peppers globally.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Rare photos and footage of the Mashco Piro, an uncontacted tribe in the Peruvian Amazon, were released by Survival International.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rare photos have captured the Mashco Piro, a previously uncontacted tribe deep in the Peruvian Amazon, emerging from their isolated territory. The images, released by Survival International on Tuesday, show numerous tribe members relaxing by a riverbank. This sighting comes amid growing concerns about the Mashco Piro's well-being.</p>

<p>According to FENAMAD, a local Indigenous rights group, increased logging activity in the area is likely pushing the tribe out of their traditional lands. The Mashco Piro may be venturing closer to settlements in search of food and a safer refuge.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/webstories/feature/mashco-piro-rare-photos-show-uncontacted-amazon-tribe-20752"><strong>Pics: Mashco Piro - Rare Photos Of Uncontacted Amazon Tribe</strong></a></p>

<p>Survival International reports the photos were taken in late June near the banks of a river in Madre de Dios, a southeastern Peruvian province bordering Brazil.</p>

<p><strong>Watch the video here:</strong></p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-media-max-width="560">

<p>"These incredible images show that a large number of isolated Mashco Piro live alone a few kilometres from where the loggers are about to start their operations," said Survival International director Caroline Pearce.</p>

<p>More than 50 Mashco Piro people appeared in recent days near a village of the Yine people called Monte Salvado. Another group of 17 appeared in the nearby village of Puerto Nuevo, said the NGO, which defends Indigenous rights.</p>

<p>The Mashco Piro, who inhabit an area located between two natural reserves in Madre de Dios, have seldom appeared as a rule and do not communicate much with the Yine or anyone, according to Survival International.</p>

<p>Several logging companies hold timber concessions inside the territory inhabited by the Mashco Piro.</p>

<p>One company, Canales Tahuamanu, has built more than 200 kilometres (120 miles) of roads for its logging trucks to extract timber, according to Survival International.</p>

<p>A Canales Tahuamanu representative in Lima did not respond to a request for comment.</p>

<p>The company is certified by the Forest Stewardship Council, according to which it has 53,000 hectares (130,000 acres) of forests in Madre de Dios to extract cedar and mahogany.</p>

<p>The Peruvian government reported on June 28 that local residents had reported seeing Mashco Piro on the Las Piedras river, 150 kilometres (93 miles) from the city of Puerto Maldonado, the capital of Madre de Dios.</p>

<p>The Mashco Piro have also been sighted across the border in Brazil, said Rosa Padilha, at the Brazilian Catholic bishops' Indigenous Missionary Council in the state of Acre.</p>

<p>"They flee from loggers on the Peruvian side," she said. "At this time of the year, they appear on the beaches to take tracajá (Amazon turtle) eggs. That's when we find their footprints on the sand. They leave behind a lot of turtle shells."</p>

<p>"They are a people with no peace, restless because they are always on the run," Padilha said.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JD Vance bashed President Joe Biden, assailed the media and saluted Donald Trump's bravery Wednesday in remarks ahead of a keynote address to grassroots Republicans to accept his nomination as the party's vice-presidential candidate.</p>

<p>Speaking on the sidelines of the Republican National Convention -- his first campaign stop as Trump's running mate -- the US senator applauded Trump's reaction to cheating death at the hands of a gunman in Pennsylvania at the weekend.</p>

<p>"The contrast between the lie that the media tells about President Trump and the man that all of us actually know, of course, we saw it in stark definition on Saturday," Vance told the audience in Milwaukee.</p>

<p>Vance said he was "terrified that we had just lost a great president" when a volley of gunfire forced Trump to hit the stage floor at the rally in Butler.</p>

<p>"And then of course he stands up a minute later, after they shot him -- they literally shot him -- and he raises his fist in the air and he says, 'Fight! Fight! Fight!"</p>

<p>Vance -- seen by critics as a conspiratorial, divisive firebrand -- didn't explain whom he meant by "they" but he had immediately blamed Democrats in the aftermath of the attack.</p>

<p>Authorities have not suggested any motive for the shooting as they investigate the slain assailant, and there is no suggestion that anyone else was involved.</p>

<h3><strong>'Let's get rid of him'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Vance, 39, took the opportunity to plug the Trump brand, which he described as "synonymous with luxury and with beauty in the real estate world."</p>

<p>And he contrasted the economy under "real president Donald Trump" with inflation under "Fake Scranton Joe Biden," saying that under the Democrat, "the basic trappings of middle-class life have become less and less attainable."</p>

<p>"Let's get rid of him, and let's bring Donald Trump back to the White House," he said.</p>

<p>Vance was to take center stage at the convention later Wednesday as Trump bids for a stunning return to the White House, four years after losing to Biden.</p>

<p>The one-term senator would be the third-youngest vice president in history -- and one of the least experienced -- if 78-year-old Trump prevails in his rematch against Biden in November.</p>

<p>The way the best-selling writer talks about Trump is in marked contrast to the hostility he voiced as he toured television studios in 2016 with a book to sell.</p>

<p>Vance was an uncompromising "Never Trumper" at the time of his new boss's election, labelling the hard-right tycoon "a moral disaster" and comparing him to Adolf Hitler.</p>

<p>He reinvented himself when he entered politics and won Trump's endorsement in the 2022 Ohio Senate race.</p>

<p>Vance has since grown into a cheerleader-in-chief for Trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric and isolationist foreign policy -- including opposition to US support for Ukraine's war against Russian invasion.</p>

<h3><strong>Modest upbringing&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Despite making his name with the 2016 memoir "Hillbilly Elegy," a best-selling account of his Appalachian family and modest Rust Belt upbringing, Vance remains something of an unknown quantity to the wider public.</p>

<p>He is slated to speak for around half an hour from 9.30 pm (0230 GMT), in a speech expected to lean heavily on his biography and relate elements of his life story to the experience of ordinary Americans.</p>

<p>Vance is already a hit with the party faithful in Milwaukee and was rewarded with a rowdy ovation as he stepped on the convention floor Monday with his wife, Usha, who is due to speak just before him.</p>

<p>Some 50,000 Republicans have descended on the shores of Lake Michigan for the four-day convention, where the Pennsylvania shooting -- which killed one bystander and left the ex-president with a bloodied ear -- has dominated proceedings.</p>

<p>The convention has emphasized party unity behind Trump, banishing the torrent of scandals that range from his role in attempts to overturn the 2020 election to his criminal conviction in a New York court this May.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

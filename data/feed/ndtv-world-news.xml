       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Bangladeshi court on Thursday ordered an arrest warrant for exiled ex-leader Sheikh Hasina, who fled to India in August after she was toppled from power by a student-led revolution.</p>

<p>"The court has... ordered the arrest of former prime minister Sheikh Hasina and to produce her in court on November 18," Mohammad Tajul Islam, chief prosecutor of Bangladesh's International Crimes Tribunal, told reporters on Thursday.</p>

<p>Hasina's 15-year rule saw widespread human rights <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/bangladesh-violence-quota-protests-5-more-murder-cases-filed-against-sheikh-hasina-total-cases-now-71-report-6430267">abuses</a>, including the mass detention and extrajudicial killings of her political opponents.</p>

<p>"Sheikh Hasina was at the helm of those who committed massacres, killings and crimes against humanity from July to August", Islam said, calling it a "remarkable day".</p>

<p>Hasina, 77, has not been seen in public since fleeing Bangladesh, and her last official whereabouts are at a military airbase near India's capital New Delhi.</p>

<p>Her presence in India has infuriated Bangladesh.</p>

<p>Dhaka has revoked her diplomatic passport, and the countries have a bilateral extradition treaty which would permit her to return to face criminal trial.</p>

<p>A clause in the treaty, however, says extradition might be refused if the offence is of a "political character".</p>

<p>Hasina's government created the deeply contentious ICT in 2010 to probe atrocities during the 1971 independence war from Pakistan.</p>

<p>The United Nations and rights groups criticised its procedural shortcomings, and it became widely seen as a means for Hasina to eliminate political opponents.</p>

<p>Several cases accusing Hasina of orchestrating the "mass murder" of protesters are being probed by the court.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump on Wednesday stood by debunked claims that immigrants in Ohio were eating pets, telling Latino voters during a town hall he was "just saying what was reported."</p>

<p>Trump in recent weeks has amplified a false claim that has gone viral that Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, were stealing residents' pets or taking wildlife from parks for food.</p>

<p>There have been no credible reports of Haitians eating pets, and officials in Ohio - including Republicans - have repeatedly said the story is untrue.</p>

<p>At a town hall hosted by Univision, an undecided Latino Republican voter from Arizona, a battleground state, asked Trump whether he truly believed that immigrants were eating pets.</p>

<p>"I was just saying what was reported. All I do is report," Trump replied during the event held in Miami. "I was there, I'm going to be there and we're going to take a look."</p>

<p>Trump added that "newspapers" had also reported on the claim, without naming any or providing any details.</p>

<p>Trump, who has not yet travelled to Springfield, has previously said he would conduct mass deportations of Haitian immigrants from the Ohio city, even though the majority of them are in the US legally.</p>

<p>The city has faced bomb threats since Trump began repeating the false accusations about Haitians.</p>

<p>In the final weeks before the Nov. 5 election, Trump is increasingly resorting to darker and more violent language about illegal immigration, an issue that opinion polls show resonates with many voters, especially Republicans.</p>

<p>He is competing against Democrat Kamala Harris for key votes from the growing Latino population. Latino voters have typically backed Democrats, but the Trump campaign is hoping to win over more Latino voters, especially men, on the back of economic discontent.</p>

<p>Harris led Trump by eight percentage points - 47% to 39% - among Hispanic voters in Reuters/Ipsos polling conducted between Sept. 11 and Oct. 7.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The Texas pardons board rejected a clemency appeal on Wednesday from an autistic man on death row whose murder conviction was based on what his lawyers say was a misdiagnosis of "shaken baby syndrome."]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Texas pardons board rejected a clemency appeal on Wednesday from an autistic man on death row whose murder conviction was based on what his lawyers say was a misdiagnosis of "shaken baby syndrome."</p>

<p>Robert Roberson, 57, is scheduled to die by lethal injection at the state penitentiary in Huntsville on Thursday for the February 2002 death of his two-year-old daughter, Nikki.</p>

<p>The Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles took up Roberson's case on Wednesday and declined by a 6-0 vote to recommend that Texas Governor Greg Abbott grant clemency.</p>

<p>Abbott is unable to grant clemency without a recommendation from the board, but he can grant a 30-day reprieve of Roberson's death sentence.</p>

<p>Gretchen Sween, one of Roberson's attorneys, urged the governor to grant the reprieve "so we can continue to pursue Mr Roberson's innocence claim."</p>

<p>"We pray that Governor Abbott does everything in his power to prevent the tragic, irreversible mistake of executing an innocent man," Sween said.</p>

<p>Roberson's case has drawn the attention of the Innocence Project, which works to reverse wrongful convictions, as well as best-selling American novelist John Grisham, Texas lawmakers and medical experts.</p>

<p>Also among those seeking to halt his execution is the man who put him behind bars -- Brian Wharton, the former chief detective in the town of Palestine.</p>

<p>"Knowing everything that I know now, I am firmly convinced that Robert is an innocent man," Wharton said at a recent press conference organized by Roberson's supporters. "The system failed Robert."</p>

<p>Grisham, author of the legal thrillers "The Firm" and "A Time to Kill," also appeared at the event and said: "What's amazing about Robert's case is that there was no crime."</p>

<p>Roberson's lawyers say the diagnosis of shaken baby syndrome, made at the hospital where his chronically ill daughter died, was erroneous and the cause of death was in fact pneumonia, which was aggravated when doctors prescribed improper medication.</p>

<p>Sween, Roberson's attorney, said there is "overwhelming new medical and scientific evidence" that shows that the little girl died of "natural and accidental causes, not abuse."</p>

<p>According to his lawyers, Roberson would be the first person executed in the United States based on a conviction of shaken baby syndrome.</p>

<h3><strong>'Unscientific'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>According to Kate Judson of the Center for Integrity in Forensic Sciences, more than 30 parents and caregivers in 18 US states have been exonerated after being wrongfully convicted using "unscientific" shaken baby testimony.</p>

<p>Sween said Roberson's autism spectrum disorder, which was not diagnosed until 2018, contributed to his arrest and conviction.</p>

<p>"It is quite possible that Mr Roberson would not be on death row today, but for his autism," she said.</p>

<p>Sween said staff at the hospital where his daughter was admitted did not know he had autism and "judged his flat affect as a sign of guilt."</p>

<p>A bipartisan group of 86 Texas state lawmakers has also urged clemency for Roberson, citing the "voluminous new scientific evidence" that casts doubt on his guilt.</p>

<p>There have been 19 executions in the United States this year.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United States launched a series of airstrikes on Wednesday evening targeting key underground weapons storage facilities controlled by Iran-backed <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/houthis-saudi-arabia-israel-explained-who-are-houthis-the-group-that-hijacked-an-india-bound-ship-4588672">Houthi rebels</a> in Yemen. The strikes, carried out by B-2 Spirit stealth bombers, marked the first-ever use of these advanced aircraft against Houthi targets since the beginning of US involvement in the Yemen conflict.</p>

<p>The US Department of Defense confirmed that five Houthi weapons storage sites, deeply buried underground, were struck in the mission. According to US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, these facilities housed advanced conventional weapons used by the Houthis to threaten civilian and military vessels operating in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden.</p>

<h3><strong>Deployment Of B-2 Bombers</strong></h3>

<p>The B-2 Spirit bomber, known for its stealth capabilities and heavy payload, is capable of delivering a far greater volume of ordnance compared to fighter jets. The B-2 offers the US military an unparalleled ability to strike high-value targets that are either deeply fortified or well-concealed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mr Austin explained that the strikes were authorised at the direction of President Joe Biden. "This was a unique demonstration of the United States' ability to target facilities that our adversaries seek to keep out of reach, no matter how deeply buried or fortified," Mr Austin stated.</p>

<h3><strong>Growing Regional Tensions</strong></h3>

<p>The timing of the strikes comes amid heightened tensions in the Middle East, with US allies, particularly Israel, facing ongoing threats from Iran and its various regional proxies. The Houthis, operating from Yemen, have consistently launched attacks on commercial shipping and military vessels, disrupting one of the world's most critical maritime trade routes. In recent months, these attacks have escalated, with the group claiming responsibility for launching ballistic and cruise missiles as well as drones against US Navy ships and international vessels.</p>

<p>The Houthis' activities in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, targeting vessels with weaponry that originated from these underground storage sites, have raised alarms about the security of global trade routes and the potential for environmental catastrophes. In August, a Greek-flagged vessel came under attack, leading to an oil spill and serious environmental concerns.</p>

<p>In September, the Houthis escalated their campaign, launching approximately two dozen ballistic and cruise missiles, as well as drones, aimed at three US Navy destroyers. Although none of these missiles struck their targets, the attacks prompted increased military activity from US forces in the region.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Houthi Attacks Tied To Regional Conflicts</strong></h3>

<p>The Iran-backed Houthis have framed their actions as part of a broader alignment with groups like Hamas and Hezbollah, who are actively engaged in ongoing conflicts with Israel. Following an attempted missile strike deep inside Israel in September, the Houthis have openly declared their support for these groups. While the missile ultimately fragmented in mid-air and caused no injuries, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned the Houthis would "pay a heavy price" for their actions. In retaliation, Israeli airstrikes targeted Houthi positions in Yemen shortly after the incident.</p>

<p>In the following weeks, the Houthis have continued launching missiles and drones toward Israel, further complicating the regional security landscape. These actions, combined with continued Houthi assaults on international shipping, have drawn significant military responses from the United States and its allies.</p>

<p>Wednesday's strike on Houthi facilities adds to a series of US military actions aimed at curbing the Houthis' growing arsenal and degrading their operational capabilities. US Central Command (CENTCOM) confirmed that there were no immediate civilian casualties from the latest strikes. Over the past year, the US has increased its military presence in the region, including the deployment of advanced naval assets such as carrier strike groups, amphibious ready groups, and guided missile destroyers, along with air support in the form of fighter jets and attack aircraft.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>More than one billion people are living in acute poverty across the globe, a UN Development Program report said Thursday, with children accounting for over half of those affected.</p>

<p>The paper published with the Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative (OPHI) highlighted that poverty rates were three times higher in countries at war, as 2023 saw the most conflicts around the world since the Second World War.</p>

<p>The UNDP and the OPHI have published their Multidimensional Poverty Index annually since 2010, harvesting data from 112 countries with a combined population of 6.3 billion people.</p>

<p>It uses indicators such as a lack of adequate housing, sanitation, electricity, cooking fuel, nutrition and school attendance.</p>

<p>"The 2024 MPI paints a sobering picture: 1.1 billion people endure multidimensional poverty, of which 455 million live in the shadow of conflict," said Yanchun Zhang, chief statistician at the UNDP.</p>

<p>"For the poor in conflict-affected countries, the struggle for basic needs is a far harsher and more desperate battle," Zhang told AFP.</p>

<p>The report echoed last year's findings that 1.1 billion out of 6.1 billion people across 110 countries were facing extreme multidimensional poverty.</p>

<p>Thursday's paper showed that some 584 million people under 18 were experiencing extreme poverty, accounting for 27.9 percent of children worldwide, compared with 13.5 percent of adults.</p>

<p>It also showed that 83.2 percent of the world's poorest people live in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia.</p>

<p>Sabina Alkire, director of the OPHI, told AFP that conflicts were hindering efforts for poverty reduction.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"At some level, these findings are intuitive. But what shocked us was the sheer magnitude of people who are struggling to live a decent life and at the same time fearing for their safety –- 455 million," she said.</p>

<p>"This points to a stark but unavoidable challenge to the international community to both zero in on poverty reduction and foster peace, so that any ensuing peace actually endures," Alkire added.</p>

<p>India was the country with the largest number of people in extreme poverty, which impacts 234 million of its 1.4 billion population.</p>

<p>It was followed by Pakistan, Ethiopia, Nigeria and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The five countries accounted for nearly half of the 1.1 billion poor people.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The World Health Organization (WHO) urged Israel to grant access to Gaza, where escalating violence has blocked humanitarian missions from delivering critical food and medical supplies.</p>

<p>Amid the chaos, WHO and its partners launched the second round of a polio vaccination campaign on Monday, aiming to immunise over half a million children, Xinhua news agency reported.</p>

<p>"The total number of children who received a second dose of polio vaccine in Gaza after two days of vaccination is 156,943," WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus wrote on X on Wednesday.</p>

<p></p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p></p>

<p>However, ongoing violence threatens the campaign's goal of vaccinating at least 90 per cent of the children, a critical target to halt the virus's spread. In addition to polio vaccines, children are receiving vitamin A supplements to strengthen their immunity.</p>

<p>WHO highlighted the severity of the situation, reporting that out of 54 scheduled United Nations missions to Gaza in October, only one has been completed, with the rest either cancelled or obstructed due to the conflict.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>"We're not so different, you and I. We've both spent our lives looking for the weakness in one another's systems. Don't you think it's time to recognize there is as little worth on your side as there is on mine?"</p>

<p>Those who've been rooting for Gary Oldman playing Jackson Lamb, the instantly unlikeable boss of the good-for-nothings of MI5, the British intelligence agency, in Apple's <em>Slow Horses</em>, may not even remember this line the actor delivered playing another spy boss in another spy thriller: as George Smiley in<em> Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy,</em> a 2011 film based on John la Carre's book.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Addressed to Smiley's Russian counterpart, Karla, this line, emblematic of the film's politics, was celebrated and decried in equal measure for creating an equivalence between the US and the USSR during the Cold War. Going by the recent media stories and diplomatic activity, George Smiley could have very well said it about India and Canada today.</p>

<h2><strong>Blow Hot, Blow Cold</strong></h2>

<p>New Delhi and Ottawa have expelled each other's top diplomats, following the Canadian Prime Minister's latest accusation of the Indian establishment being directly involved in the assassination of a Sikh separatist on Canadian soil. India, on the other hand, has not only denied it but also mounted a counterattack on Canada for nurturing anti-India groups within its territory.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Fall is not fair weather for India-Canada relations. Exactly one year ago, the two countries were engaged in similar diplomatic acrimony over the same assassination. Khalistan, after nuclear proliferation, has been their proverbial bee in the bonnet for several decades. With the exception of the lull during the turn of the millennium, the issue has stayed alive and volatile. It is not going anywhere in a hurry.</p>

<p>Canada's soft approach towards anti-India outfits was once attributed solely to its domestic politics: the country is home to the largest Sikh diaspora, with around 7,70,000 of them living there. The current strain in the relationship, however, may not just be about Canada's vote bank politics or India's internal affairs involving resistance from a sect of Sikhs. There is, quite clearly, an emergence of bilateral antagonism now. Are the rapprochement personnel doing their job well? Or, more provocatively, are the spies doing theirs?</p>

<h2><strong>Flashbacks From 1975</strong></h2>

<p>Realistically speaking, assassinations on foreign soil are not a no-go zone, even with declared enemies, if the assassins are smart. The morality and legality of such actions is another story. What, then, has compelled Canada, a limited ally, to make public its investigations in the Nijjar assassination case and hold India responsible? Has there been a slight or a breach of trust, intended or otherwise, behind the scenes that a public show is to be put up? Are there bad-faith actors at work on either side, or is it sheer incompetence? It could be either or both, but as venerable Canadian writer Margaret Atwood reminds us, "Stupidity is the same as evil if you judge by the results". Therefore, it's the breakdown of bilateral ties that matters, much more than the nitty-gritty of what caused it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This escalation of diplomatic tensions between India and Canada is beginning to loosely resemble another controversial diplomatic event that occurred half a century ago: the breakdown of the then newly forged Australia-North Korea relations. On October 30, 1975, Pyongyang recalled its diplomats from Canberra, citing the host country's 'unfriendly attitude' and 'intolerable provocative acts' in a communication sent via commercial mail. Less than ten days later, Australian diplomats were ousted from Pyongyang on November 8 on account of 'unfriendly behaviour' and 'abuse of diplomatic immunity'.</p>

<p>The actors and the times are different, but the problem is the same. This inability to smoothen out the rough edges time and again reflects poorly on the political and diplomatic leaders of India and Canada. What are long bilateral ties worth if they cannot withstand such events? Both Ottawa and New Delhi have engaged in the game of provocation and reconciliation. The classic blow-hot, blow-cold approach. To what end, though?&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>A Lesson From<em> Bridge Of Spies</em></strong></h2>

<p>Coming back to George Smiley's wisdom, looking for weaknesses in the other is a zero-sum game. This isn't the Cold War yet, but as India grows in stature, the chances of this game intensifying will increase correspondingly. India and Canada are not directly engaged in any military-territorial jostling, so these flare-ups have an even more limited scope. Both are citing long-term national security concerns, and other countries like the UK and the US are trying to broker 'peace' by urging India to cooperate in the investigation.</p>

<p>Diplomacy is an exercise in sifting fact from fiction but addressing both because both matter, even if unequally. Another popular culture reference to demonstrate it comes from <em>Bridge of Spies</em>, a 2014 film about the famous spy exchange between the US and USSR. James Donovan (Tom Hanks), a lawyer representing a Russian spy called Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance), tells him, "The case against you matters. Making them prove it matters. The fiction is: whether you did it or not doesn't matter. The state has to prove it, that you're a spy".</p>

<p>Before anyone condescends about taking lessons from fiction, remember, apart from John la Carre, celebrated writers like Ian Fleming and Graham Greene once served in MI6.&nbsp;</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Relatives of Lyle and Erik Menendez on Wednesday pleaded for the release of the long-imprisoned brothers as US prosecutors review new evidence concerning the infamous 1989 murder of their parents.</p>

<p>The grisly shotgun slayings of wealthy music mogul Jose Menendez and his wife Kitty in their Beverly Hills home -- and their sons' subsequent, televised murder trials -- became the subject of a media frenzy. A hit Netflix series has recently sparked fresh interest in the case.</p>

<p>The brothers, aged 21 and 18 at the time of the murders, tearfully testified they killed their parents for fear of their own lives after years of sexual abuse by their father.&nbsp;</p>

<p>They were convicted of first-degree murder and have been serving life sentences in prison without possibility of parole since their sentencing in 1996.</p>

<p>"As details of Lyle and Eric's abuse came to light, it became clear that their actions, while tragic, were the desperate response of two boys trying to survive the unspeakable cruel(ty) of their father," their 92-year-old aunt Joan VanderMolen said Wednesday.</p>

<p>"Lyle and Erik have already paid a heavy price, discarded by a system that failed to recognize their pain," she told a news conference attended by some 30 relatives.</p>

<p>Their initial trial, starting in 1993, was one of the first televised murder cases to make daily headlines around the world. It ended in a mistrial due to a deadlocked jury, but they were found guilty in a second trial.</p>

<p>Prosecutors argued they conspired to murder their parents in order to inherit their $14 million fortune.</p>

<p>Last year, the brothers' attorneys filed a court petition setting out new evidence which they said demonstrates Jose Menendez's history of sexual abuse.</p>

<p>Among the new evidence is a letter Erik wrote to a cousin months before the murders, saying "I've been trying to avoid dad. It's still happening... Every night I stay up thinking he might come in."</p>

<p>Former Latino boy band member Roy Rossello said in a documentary series released last year that he was drugged and raped by Jose Menendez in the 1980s.</p>

<p>The brothers' attorneys have called for a resentencing, which could see their clients released from prison given the lengthy time already spent behind bars.</p>

<p>Prosecutors said in a statement Wednesday that Los Angeles's criminal justice system "has developed a more modern understanding of sexual violence since the Menendez brothers first faced prosecution."&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Today, our office acknowledges that sexual violence is a pervasive issue affecting countless individuals -- of all gender identities," they wrote, confirming the case is being reviewed on multiple fronts.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, Los Angeles district attorney George Gascon told reporters he had "a moral and an ethical obligation to review what is being presented to us."</p>

<p>His comments came two weeks after the release on Netflix of the crime drama "Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story." The streaming giant also put out a documentary film, "The Menendez Brothers," last week.</p>

<p>Gascon, who is running for re-election on a criminal reform platform, acknowledged the initial Netflix show resulted in a large number of calls to his office about the case.</p>

<p>A hearing is scheduled for November 26.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On the eve of King Charles III's landmark tour Down Under, many of his antipodean subjects are unaware or uninterested -- a sign, experts say, of a more diverse and less Anglo-centric Australia.</p>

<p>There is no red-white-and-blue bunting around Sydney Harbour, no posters on the city's streets and aside from cries from ardent monarchists and republicans, little chatter about the first visit of a sitting Australian monarch in 13 years.</p>

<p>"I'd forgotten they were even coming," said 73-year-old Sydneysider Trevor Reeves summing up the mood in Australia's largest city.</p>

<p>This six-day royal visit to Sydney and Canberra will undoubtedly bring pomp, ceremony and plenty of media coverage.</p>

<p>Even with the schedule skimmed back because of Charles' cancer diagnosis, there will be extravagant mass gatherings, including an event in front of the Opera House and a sprawling community barbecue.</p>

<p>But few expect Charles and Camilla's visit to match the buzz of nation-stopping royal visits past -- including Charles and his first wife Diana's trip in 1983.</p>

<p>Today Aussies appear more preoccupied with war in the Middle East, the US election, or another group of British visitors -- rock group Oasis -- who will tour next year.</p>

<p>"I'm not excited, but I don't begrudge them coming out," said 72-year-old Susanne Lowire. "They don't have much impact over here."</p>

<p>"Some people just love it as they love movie stars," said Lowire, likening the royals to musical brothers Liam and Noel Gallagher.</p>

<p>"Are they going to fight again? Do they sound terrible? It's the same with the king and the queen coming over," she said.</p>

<p>University of Sydney historian Cindy McCreery believes the lack of attention being paid to the royal visit is understandable amid worries about war, climate change and the cost of living.</p>

<p>"We live in a complex moment with all the global issues," she said. It is "natural to expect a more varied response to the monarchy".&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, decades-long demographic trends are also shaping perceptions.</p>

<h3><strong>A changing nation</strong>&nbsp;</h3>

<p>About 36 per cent of Australians still identify as "English", the country's largest ancestry, according to a 2021 census.</p>

<p>That figure was 10 points higher when the census first asked that question in 1986.</p>

<p>About a third of Australians today were born overseas, and the population is steadily becoming more Italian, Greek, Lebanese, Indian or Chinese.</p>

<p>"That impacts how Australians connect or do not connect," McCreery said.</p>

<p>"In previous royal visits, people may have had a stronger connection to Britain, but a growing number of people may not necessarily have that immediate connection."</p>

<p>Polls show about a third of Australians would like to ditch the monarchy, a third would keep it, and a third are ambivalent.</p>

<p>So no sweeping constitutional change is on the cards, and the issue is a political dead rubber.</p>

<p>While Australia voted against becoming a republic in 1999, the movement remains active, but in political purgatory.</p>

<p>Australia's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese is a lifelong Republican and even created a minister for the republic when he came to office.</p>

<p>The post was quietly scrapped earlier this year and Albanese, having heavily lost a referendum on Indigenous rights, has ruled out going back to the voters about the royals.</p>

<h3><strong>Royal collectors&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>The royals are not without Australian fans.</p>

<p>Still, even Jan Hugo, one of the largest royal memorabilia collectors in the Southern Hemisphere, will not travel two hours to Sydney to see the king and queen, when they visit.</p>

<p>Her home in rural New South Wales could be mistaken for a museum. Every corner is bursting with more than 10,000 pieces of royal memorabilia.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hugo admits she has given up counting how many items she has.</p>

<p>"It's probably worth a fortune to me and nothing to somebody else," she said.</p>

<p>It all started 40 years ago when she was given a commemorative coin for the engagement of Charles and Diana.</p>

<p>Now, most of Hugo's home is dedicated to the royal family, with unusual trinkets lining the walls.</p>

<p>A large statue of Queen Elizabeth II sits on a throne surrounded by her beloved corgis.</p>

<p>Hugo said the republic debate rears its head every time the royals visit, but whatever Australia decides she just hopes to get her hands on some memorabilia.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lifeguards declared Sydney's famed Bondi beach and several other strands closed Thursday, as more mysterious black "tar ball" globules washed up along the city's shores.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For days, thousands of black spheres -- ranging from the size of peas to tennis balls -- have appeared on the sand, puzzling locals and tourists alike.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Chemical testing has identified them as hydrocarbon-based tar balls, local officials said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Tar balls can form when slicks of spilled oil are battered by wind and waves, mixing to form a sticky seawater emulsion that eventually breaks into smaller pieces or "balls". &nbsp;</p>

<p>The source is still unknown.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"As a precaution, all Waverley Beaches will be closed until further investigation has been carried out," a local council that includes Bondi said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The mayor of another beachside council, Dylan Parker, said three other beaches were also closed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Our beaches will remain closed and we are investigating," he said. "We are still waiting for the tides to come in."&nbsp;</p>

<p>While formally closed, access to the beaches has not been forcibly restricted, so some brave surfers and swimmers could still be seen in the water.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is common for authorities to declare beaches closed during large swells.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 69-year-old American man died when his home was destroyed by fire. According to <em>The New York Post,</em> an e-scooter in the Brooklyn apartment caught fire due to a faulty lithium-ion battery.</p>

<p>The massive fire that killed the old man and injured two others broke out inside the second-floor apartment on Brighton 3rd Street near Brightwater Court in Brighton Beach. The flames and the heat created by it were so intense that it blocked the exit from the house, resulting in the death of the 69-year-old, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/10/16/us-news/e-scooter-sparks-deadly-nyc-fire-killing-69-year-old-resident-trapped-in-his-apartment-fdny/?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=nypost&amp;utm_source=twitter"><em>as per the news report.</em></a></p>

<p>A 32-year-old woman and 35-year-old man who were also home at the time were hospitalised after they tried to douse the flames-aa risky move when dealing with a battery fire, according to Flynn and police.</p>

<p>"So they attempted to extinguish the fire [and] they were able to escape with minor injuries," FDNY Chief Fire Marshal Daniel Flynn said. "There were two children as well that self-evacuated and did not sustain injuries.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[While Israel's plans for retaliation are not directly tied to the upcoming election, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is reportedly aware of the potential impact on American politics. ]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>American officials expect Israel to retaliate against Iran before the November 5 Presidential polls in the United States, <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/10/16/politics/israel-iran-conflict-election-day/index.html ">CNN</a> has learnt from sources. It comes after Iran launched at least 200 ballistic missiles targeting Israel earlier this month. The Iranian aerial attack came after Israel targeted Southern Lebanon, killing nearly 2,500 people,&nbsp;including some key Hezbollah leaders.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
<br />
While Israel's plans for retaliation are not directly tied to the upcoming election, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is reportedly aware of the potential impact on American politics. The growing unrest in the Middle East is adding further complexities to Vice-President Kamala Harris' campaign. Their handling of Israel's year-long war in Gaza has drawn sharp criticism from both sides of the political spectrum. Progressives demand stronger humanitarian efforts in Gaza, while Republicans accuse the administration of failing to manage the situation effectively.<br />
<br />
The Biden administration has recently intensified its calls for Israel to improve humanitarian conditions in Gaza. In a letter from Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, the US warned that continued military assistance could be at risk if Israel failed to increase aid to Gaza. The letter, however, lacked Biden or Harris's signatures.<br />
<br />
The deadline for Israel to meet humanitarian benchmarks extends beyond the election. Meanwhile, the US has bolstered Israel's defences with an advanced air defence system called THAAD.<br />
<br />
For Biden and Harris, the timing of Israel's counter-strike could pose significant challenges, particularly in key swing states like Michigan, home to a large Arab-American community. As the election nears, Harris has been campaigning in the state where the Israeli war has become a sensitive topic. Biden has urged Israel to avoid targeting Iran's nuclear or oil sites, but Netanyahu said that Israel will act based on its national interests. Some US officials believe Netanyahu's actions could impact the election, possibly helping former President and Republican candidate Donald Trump, though there is no direct evidence.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The US remains focused on preventing a larger regional war. While it is unclear how Israel will attack, both military and cyber options are possible.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The study found the microplastic particles exhaled by bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) are similar in chemical composition to those identified in human lungs.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bottlenose dolphins in Sarasota Bay in Florida and Barataria Bay in Louisiana are exhaling microplastic fibers, according to new research published in the journal PLOS One.</p>

<p>Tiny plastic pieces have spread all over the planet – on land, in the air and even in clouds. An estimated 170 trillion bits of microplastic are estimated to be in the oceans alone. Across the globe, research has found people and wildlife are exposed to microplastics mainly through eating and drinking, but also through breathing.</p>

<p>Our study found the microplastic particles exhaled by bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) are similar in chemical composition to those identified in human lungs. Whether dolphins are exposed to more of these pollutants than people are is not yet known.</p>

<p><strong>Why it matters</strong></p>

<p>In humans, inhaled microplastics can cause lung inflammation, which can lead to problems including tissue damage, excess mucus, pneumonia, bronchitis, scarring and possibly cancer. Since dolphins and humans inhale similar plastic particles, dolphins may be at risk for the same lung problems.</p>

<p>Research also shows plastics contain chemicals that, in humans, can affect reproduction, cardiovascular health and neurological function. Since dolphins are mammals, microplastics may well pose these health risks for them, too.</p>

<p>As top predators with decades-long life spans, bottlenose dolphins help scientists understand the impacts of pollutants on marine ecosystems – and the related health risks for people living near coasts. This research is important because more than 41% of the world's human population lives within 62 miles (100 km) of a coast.</p>

<p><strong>What still isn't known</strong></p>

<p>Scientists estimate the oceans contain many trillions of plastic particles, which get there through runoff, wastewater or settling from the air. Ocean waves can release these particles into the air.</p>

<p>In fact, bubble bursts caused by wave energy can release 100,000 metric tons of microplastics into the atmosphere each year. Since dolphins and other marine mammals breathe at the water's surface, they may be especially vulnerable to exposure.</p>

<p>Where there are more people, there is usually more plastic. But for the tiny plastic particles floating in the air, this connection isn't always true. Airborne microplastics are not limited to heavily populated areas; they pollute undeveloped regions, too.</p>

<p>Our research found microplastics in the breath of dolphins living in both urban and rural estuaries, but we don't yet know whether there are major differences in amounts or types of plastic particles between the two habitats.</p>

<p><strong>How we do our work</strong></p>

<p>Breath samples for our study were collected from wild bottlenose dolphins during catch-and-release health assessments conducted in partnership with the Brookfield Zoo Chicago, Sarasota Dolphin Research Program, National Marine Mammal Foundation and Fundación Oceanogràfic.</p>

<p>During these brief permitted health assessments, we held a petri dish or a customized spirometer – a device that measures lung function – above the dolphin's blowhole to collect samples of the animals' exhaled breath. Using a microscope in our colleague's lab, we checked for tiny particles that looked like plastic, such as pieces with smooth surfaces, bright colors or a fibrous shape.</p>

<p>Since plastic melts when heated, we used a soldering needle to test whether these suspected pieces were plastic. To confirm they were indeed plastic, our colleague used a specialized method called Raman spectroscopy, which uses a laser to create a structural fingerprint that can be matched to a specific chemical.</p>

<p>Our study highlights how extensive plastic pollution is – and how other living things, including dolphins, are exposed. While the impacts of plastic inhalation on dolphins' lungs are not yet known, people can help address the microplastic pollution problem by reducing plastic use and working to prevent more plastic from polluting the oceans.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A new paper searches huge human data sets for gene variants that throw the 1:1 sex ratio off balance, and test the biological and theoretical rules of sex ratio.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We know that boys and girls are produced in much the same frequency. But how – and why – is this 1:1 ratio achieved? A new paper searches huge human data sets for gene variants that throw the 1:1 sex ratio off balance, and test the biological and theoretical rules of sex ratio.</p>

<p>What produces the 1:1 sex ratio? Early scientists credited divine providence with ensuring that “every male should have its female”.</p>

<p>Of course, we now know that sex chromosomes are the real determiners of sex. Females have two X chromosomes; males have a single X and a male-specific Y.</p>

<p>The Y carries a male-determining gene called SRY, which kickstarts the differentiation of a ridge of cells into a testis. The embryonic testis makes male hormones which direct the embryo to develop as a boy. Without SRY, an alternative pathway is activated that makes an ovary, and the embryo develops as a girl.</p>

<p>The 1:1 ratio results from the way the X and Y chromosomes are doled out in sperm and eggs. Our cells all have two sets of chromosomes that constitute our genome, one set from each parent. A special type of cell division makes sperm and eggs with just a single set of chromosomes, so that a fertilised egg once again has two sets (one set from the sperm and the other from the egg).</p>

<p>So sperm all get a single copy of each chromosome – and just one sex chromosome, either an X or a Y. XX females make eggs with a single chromosome set, all of which carry an X.</p>

<p>When a sperm fertilises an egg, the sex chromosome the sperm carries determines the sex of the baby. Embryos that receive one X from the mother and another X from the father are destined to be XX girls, and embryos that receive a Y-bearing sperm will develop as XY boys.</p>

<p>So the 1:1 XY ratio in sperm should produce a 1:1 ratio of XX girls and XY boys.</p>

<p>Sex ratio variation But there are lots of exceptions to a 1:1 ratio in the animal kingdom. There are genetic mutations that subvert the orderly segregation of the X and Y, or that preferentially kill male or female embryos.</p>

<p><strong>Why should the sex ratio be stuck at 1:1 anyway?</strong></p>

<p>After all, a few males can fertilise the eggs of many females.</p>

<p>Indeed, for many animals, unequal sex ratios are the norm. For instance, the mouse-sized marsupial Antechinus stuartii produces only 32% males, even when assessed at birth (so it's not that male babies die more often).</p>

<p>Many birds have sex ratios far from 1:1, and some show very specific adaptations that make ecological sense. For instance, the second kookaburra chick to hatch, facing a lower chance of survival, is usually a female, the sex most likely to survive.</p>

<p>And there are systems of non-standard sex chromosomes. Polar mammals and strange rodents, for instance, are famous for systems in which a mutant X chromosome quashes SRY to form fertile XY females, or a mutated version of SRY doesn't work. In these species, females predominate, which makes sense for mammals that have to get all their breeding done in a short summer.</p>

<p>Insects take the cake. An extreme case is a kind of mite that produces a ratio of 15 females to 1 male. In many fruit fly species, 95% of sperm carry the X chromosome, so the progeny are largely female.</p>

<p><strong>Why a 1:1 sex ratio in humans?</strong></p>

<p>Fisher's principle So if sex ratio is so malleable, why have humans (and most mammals) gone for a 1:1 ratio? The great British statistician Ronald Fisher proposed that the ratio is self-correcting and will tend to 1:1 unless there are evolutionary forces that select for distortions.</p>

<p>The argument is simple. Given every baby must have a mother and a father, if there is a deficiency in one sex, the parents of the rarer sex will have more grandchildren than parents of the more common sex.</p>

<p>For instance, if males are the rarer sex, parents who by chance produce more sons than daughters will leave more grandchildren than those that produce more daughters than sons. As a result, son-producing genes will get a boost until parity is reached.</p>

<p>So do we see measurable and heritable departures from 1:1 in the family sex ratio of human sons to daughters? What about Fisher's principle – is there any evidence that strong evolutionary effects are constraining the human population sex ratio to be 1:1? In the new research published this week, researchers Siliang Song and Jianzhi Zhang from the University of Michigan conducted an exhaustive examination of huge human data sets from the United Kingdom and found the answer is an emphatic no. They did identify two genetic variants that affected sex ratio, but these seemed not to be passed on through families.</p>

<p>So why do humans obey the 1:1 rule? Is it just statistical artefact, because any one family has relatively so few children that even large departures from a 1:1 ratio get evened out across many families? Some families have the gene variants to produce more sons than daughters, but other families produce more daughters than sons. Song and Zhang's analysis suggests this high variability is part of the problem for demonstrating any systematic bias.</p>

<p>Another possibility is that humans face special evolutionary constraints. Perhaps the human tendency for monogamy places additional evolutionary pressure on humans to adhere to Fisher's principle in a way that does not apply to other animal species.</p>

<p>Whatever the answer, this paper by Song and Zhang raises many intriguing questions, and will be a stimulus to further research on the longstanding and fascinating question of parity in the human sex ratio.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Swiss industrialist Pankaj Oswal filed an appeal with the United Nations against the alleged illegal detention of his 26-year-old daughter in Uganda.</p>

<p>Vasundhara Oswal was seized by around 20 armed men, who did not produce an identification or warrant, from Oswal's&nbsp;extra-neutral alcohol (ENA) plant in Uganda. While she was detained on October 1, purportedly in a missing man's case, an&nbsp;urgent appeal to the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention (WGAD) was filed earlier this week.</p>

<p>A post on Vasundhara's Instagram handle detailed her "unlawful detainment and arrest", showing a toilet with blood and faeces on the floor. The post claimed that she forced to sit in a room full of shoes for over 90 hours, and not allowed to bathe or change her clothes for nearly five days.&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman was denied basic necessities, like clean water and proper food,&nbsp;given a small bench to sleep on, and made to participate in a suspect parade.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a startling admission during a public inquiry on Wednesday, Canadian Prime Minister <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/as-we-had-said-no-evidence-whatsoever-india-on-justin-trudeaus-deposition-6806506">Justin Trudeau</a> admitted that Canada had no "hard evidentiary proof" to support allegations linking Indian government agents to the killing of Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar last year. Mr Trudeau's testimony came amid heightened diplomatic tensions between India and Canada, which escalated following these accusations in 2023.</p>

<p>Speaking during a public inquiry into alleged foreign interference in Canada's federal electoral processes and democratic institutions, Mr Trudeau revealed that his claims about India's involvement were based on intelligence rather than conclusive evidence.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I was briefed on the fact that there was intelligence from Canada, and possibly from Five Eyes allies that made it fairly clear, incredibly clear, that India was involved in this... Agents of the government of India were involved in the killing of a Canadian on Canadian soil," he said.</p>

<p>The Five Eyes network, comprising Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand, focuses on surveillance and signals intelligence (SIGINT). According to Mr Trudeau, the information presented was alarming enough for the Canadian government to take seriously.</p>

<p>Mr Trudeau alleged that Indian diplomats were engaged in gathering information on Canadians who were critical of the Modi government, with this data reportedly being passed to senior Indian officials and criminal organizations, including the Lawrence Bishnoi gang. The Bishnoi gang, notorious for its involvement in organised crime, has been linked by Canadian authorities to violence targeting the South Asian community, specifically pro-Khalistani activists in Canada.</p>

<p>Nijjar, a designated terrorist by India's National Investigation Agency in 2020, was shot dead outside a gurdwara in Surrey, British Columbia, in June 2023. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) later stated that six Indian diplomats were allegedly part of a plot to murder Nijjar. The Canadian Police also suggested that the Bishnoi gang was connected to Indian government agents.</p>

<p>Mr Trudeau explained that Canada had the option to go public with the allegations during the G20 summit held in New Delhi in September 2023 but chose not to.</p>

<p>"Our response was, well, it's within your security agencies," Mr Trudeau said, recounting Canada's exchanges with India. "At that point, it was primarily intelligence, not hard evidentiary proof. So we said, let's work together and look into your security services."</p>

<p>Mr Trudeau added that he confronted Prime Minister Narendra Modi during the G20 summit, claiming that Canada was aware of India's alleged involvement. According to Mr Trudeau, PM Modi's response was to express concern about individuals in Canada critical of the Indian government, requesting that they be arrested.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Canada's Response, India's Retaliation</strong></h2>

<p>The diplomatic fallout between the two countries worsened when India expelled six Canadian diplomats following Mr Trudeau's allegations. India also recalled its High Commissioner to Canada, Sanjay Kumar Verma, as part of the escalating diplomatic row. Mr Trudeau accused India of not cooperating with Canada's investigation, while India dismissed the claims as unfounded.</p>

<p>India responded with rejection of the accusations, stating that the Canadian government had failed to provide any evidence.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"What we have heard today only confirms what we have been saying consistently all along - Canada has presented us (India) no evidence whatsoever in support of the serious allegations that it has chosen to level against India and Indian diplomats," the MEA said in a statement.&nbsp;"The responsibility for the damage that this cavalier behaviour has caused to India-Canada relations lies with Prime Minister Trudeau alone."</p>

<p>This follows India's sharp rebuttal to Canada on Monday, rejecting allegations Mr Verma being a 'person of interest' in a murder investigation, describing them as "preposterous imputations."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Canada reportedly named &nbsp;High Commissioner Verma as a 'person of interest' in its investigation into Nijjar's death. India swiftly hit back, accusing Canada of maligning its officials without evidence and using "preposterous" claims to justify its failure to curb Khalistani extremism on its soil.</p>

<p>In a strongly worded statement, New Delhi condemned Canada's diplomatic communication suggesting that the Indian High Commissioner and other Indian diplomats were implicated in a sensitive investigation. An MEA response stated, "The Government of India strongly rejects these preposterous imputations and ascribes them to the political agenda of the Mr Trudeau Government that is centred around vote bank politics."</p>

<p>The Indian government has consistently argued that Canada provides a safe haven for pro-Khalistani extremists and separatists who pose a threat to India's security. New Delhi also highlighted that it had requested action against these elements, which Canada had failed to take seriously.</p>

<h2><strong>'Major Win' For India&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p>Canadian journalist Daniel Bordman has described Mr Trudeau's admission as a "major win for the Indian narrative." Speaking with news agency ANI, Mr Bordman noted that Canada's initially aggressive stance, including the expulsion of Indian diplomats and accusations targeting India, has now been tempered by Mr Trudeau's clarification.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"This is a pretty big win for the Indian narrative... We had gone pretty hard. We had kicked out a diplomat and named the Indian High Commission," Mr Bordman said.</p>

<p>The heart of the diplomatic row remains unresolved, according to Mr Bordman, centring around perspectives on Nijjar's identity - whether he was a Khalistani terrorist, as India claims, or a community activist, as many in Canada believe.</p>

<p>"On the geopolitical technicality aspect, India wins here because you never said you had evidence. But what does it change from the grand structures of things? Ultimately, the diplomatic spat is really about the unanswered question, was Hardeep Singh Nijjar a Khalistani terrorist or a community activist? And that general disagreement has not moved," Bordman added.</p>

<p>Mr Bordman also criticised Mr Trudeau's claim that Canada supports India's territorial integrity. "Trudeau says things and then does things that don't align with what he says... He might claim to be against Khalistani separatism, but his actions tell a different story," Mr Bordman remarked.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>North Korean hackers have stolen an estimated $3 billion worth of cryptocurrency since 2017, using the funds to support the regime's nuclear and missile programmes, a Microsoft report showed on Thursday.</p>

<p>Of that amount, between $600 million and $1 billion was stolen just last year, based on Microsoft's ‘Digital Defence Report for 2024'.</p>

<p>The report highlights that these stolen funds have financed over half of Pyongyang's nuclear development efforts, reports Yonhap news agency.</p>

<p>Since last year, Microsoft has identified several new North Korean hacking groups -- Moonstone Sleet, Jade Sleet, Sapphire Sleet and Citrine Sleet, which have been targeting cryptocurrency organisations.</p>

<p>In particular, Moonstone Sleet has developed a custom ransomware variant and deployed it against unidentified entities in the aerospace and defence sectors for both intelligence gathering and financial gain.</p>

<p>Microsoft analysts said the emergence of new hacking groups suggests that the North Korean regime is expanding its involvement in ransomware activities, increasing the use of cybercriminal tools to bolster the regime's financial resources and advance its strategic interests.</p>

<p>"Nation-states are becoming more aggressive in the cyber domain, with ever-growing levels of technical sophistication that reflect increased investment in resources and training," said Tom Burt, Microsoft's vice president of customer security and trust.</p>

<p>Microsoft also warned of rising cyber threats by state-backed actors, especially those related to Russia, China and Iran, ahead of the U.S. presidential election and amid persistent geopolitical conflicts in Europe and the Middle East.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, South Korea, the US and Japan recently agreed to bolster joint efforts to combat North Korea's illegal cyber activities, which are increasingly targeting the virtual currency industry.</p>

<p>The three sides stressed the importance of strengthening partnerships with the private sector, particularly with cryptocurrency service providers, to raise awareness of Pyongyang's cyber threats.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Meta is laying off employees across units including Instagram, WhatsApp and Reality Labs, the Verge reported on Wednesday, citing people familiar with the matter.</p>

<p>A Meta spokesperson told Reuters in a statement that a few of its teams were making changes to align with their long-term strategic goals and location strategy.</p>

<p>"This includes moving some teams to different locations and moving some employees to different roles. In situations like these when a role is eliminated, we work hard to find other opportunities for impacted employees," the spokesperson said.</p>

<p>The Verge report did not specify the exact number of job cuts but mentioned that they were small. Meta also did not comment on the numbers.</p>

<p>Separately, the Financial Times reported that Meta fired another two dozen staff in Los Angeles for allegedly using their daily $25 meal credits to instead buy household items including acne pads, wine glasses and laundry detergent.</p>

<p>These terminations are separate from the team restructurings and took place last week, the FT report said.</p>

<p>Meta declined to comment on the FT report.</p>

<p>Meta has slashed around 21,000 jobs since November 2022 to keep costs low with CEO Mark Zuckerberg calling 2023 the "Year of Efficiency".</p>

<p>Meta shares have jumped more than 60% this year.</p>

<p>In its most recent second-quarter results, Meta beat market expectations for revenue and issued a rosy sales forecast for the third quarter, signalling that robust digital-ad spending on its social media platforms can cover the cost of its artificial intelligence investments.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Stray dogs have been eating the people killed in Israeli strikes in Gaza, CNN reported Wednesday. Fares Afana, the head of emergency services in the northern part of the war-torn enclave, told CNN that he and his colleagues had received the bodies of Palestinians killed in northern Gaza, with some showing signs of scavenging by animals.</p>

<p>"Stray dogs who are hungry are eating these bodies in the street... It makes it difficult for us to identify the bodies," he said.</p>

<p>He said that the Israeli forces are "destroying everything that represents life or signs of life", referring to the air and ground assaults in northern <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/israel-hezbollah-tunnels-nothing-like-we-saw-in-gaza-israel-shares-video-of-hezbollah-tunnel-6799411" target="_blank">Gaza</a> and the Jabalia area, where Israel claims that Hamas members have been regrouping.</p>

<p>Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza after <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/israel-gaza-iran-hamas-sought-irans-help-for-israel-attack-planned-9-11-style-bombing-report-6779663" target="_blank">Hamas</a> attacked Israeli towns on October 7 last year, resulting in the deaths of 1,206 people, mostly civilians.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/gaza-mother-mourns-son-killed-in-israeli-strike-before-second-polio-vaccine-6803871" target="_blank">Israel's assault</a> has since then killed 42,409 people, the majority civilians, and injured 99,153 others in the Gaza Strip.</p>

<p>In its daily update on Wednesday, the Gaza health ministry said Israeli military strikes had killed 65 Palestinians across the enclave in the past 24 hours.</p>

<p>Mr Afana said that on Monday Israeli troops had fired on hungry residents searching for food at a warehouse aid center run by the UN's agency for Palestine refugees (UNRWA).</p>

<p>"The situation is getting worse," he said, adding that they "can't do their jobs normally".</p>

<p>"What is happening in northern Gaza is a real genocide," he said.</p>

<h3><strong>UNRWA Warns Of 'Real Risk' Of Gaza Famine</strong></h3>

<p>The UNRWA warned Wednesday of the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/in-gaza-hungry-families-forced-to-slaughter-horses-eat-animal-fodder-5141815" target="_blank">risk of famine in Gaza</a> as Israel intensified its operations in the north of the besieged Palestinian territory.</p>

<p>At a press conference, UNRWA chief Philippe Lazzarini said that "there is a real risk today... that we enter a situation where famine or acute malnutrition is unfortunately again a likelihood," pointing to the upcoming winter and the weakened immune systems of Gaza's population.</p>

<p>Speaking on the humanitarian situation in Gaza, he said it had "become a kind of wasteland, which I would say is almost unliveable".</p>

<p>Mr Lazzarini said that with appropriate action, a hunger crisis in Gaza "can be avoided" if convoys and food are allowed to enter.</p>]]></content:encoded>

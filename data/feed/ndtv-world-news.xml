       <description><![CDATA[Gong's trip to Riyadh was inspired after Ronaldo had to cancel a planned visit to China in February due to a leg injury.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cristiano Ronaldo, a legendary footballer with a global fan base, recently met a 24-year-old superfan named Gong, who cycled from China to Saudi Arabia for seven months to meet him. Starting from his home on March 18, Gong arrived at the Al Nassr Football Club on October 20, as the <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scmp.com/news/people-culture/trending-china/article/3283844/devoted-china-cristiano-ronaldo-football-fan-takes-13000km-bicycle-ride-meet-idol" rel="nofollow, noindex">South China Morning Post</a></em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scmp.com/news/people-culture/trending-china/article/3283844/devoted-china-cristiano-ronaldo-football-fan-takes-13000km-bicycle-ride-meet-idol" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em> </em></a>reported.</p>

<p>Throughout his journey, Gong cycled through several countries, including Kazakhstan, Georgia, Iran, and Qatar, before reaching Riyadh, Saudi Arabia's capital. After Ronaldo's team learned about Gong's extraordinary effort, they arranged a meeting outside the Al Nassr Football Club.</p>

<p>During their encounter, Ronaldo signed Gong's shirt and posed for several photos with him. According to the South China Morning Post, Gong faced numerous challenges. He struggled with language barriers, budget-friendly meals in different countries, and the physical exhaustion of cycling such a vast distance.</p>

<p>Gong's trip to Riyadh was inspired after Ronaldo had to cancel a planned visit to China in February due to a leg injury. Gong covered an impressive 13,000 kilometres on his bike, carrying essentials like two 60,000mAh power banks, a tent, cooking utensils, clothes, and other necessities. In places where food was costly, he relied on bread and used translation software to communicate with locals. In August, while in Armenia, he fell ill with a high fever and collapsed on the roadside, later receiving free hospital treatment.</p>

<p>Reflecting on the journey, Gong shared that the experience made him more mature and patient and helped him forge new friendships. After reaching Riyadh on October 10, he waited several days to meet Ronaldo, who was in Europe at the time. The Al Nassr FC staff assured him of a brief meeting, which finally happened after he saw Ronaldo play in an Al Nassr vs. Al Shabab match, thanks to a fan who offered him a ticket.</p>

<p>When Gong met Ronaldo, the footballer shook his hand, hugged him, and signed his No. 7 Al Nassr jersey. Ronaldo also autographed a banner with the names of Gong's friends and inscribed the phrase, "What I dream of is true love and freedom."</p>

<p>In China, Ronaldo, or "C Luo," is celebrated for his record-breaking career, boasting over 900 goals and being the most-followed individual on Instagram, with 640 million followers. Gong now plans to visit Portugal, Ronaldo's hometown, as his next adventure.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[New York is where Trump made his name as a playboy property developer, emblazoning skyscrapers with his name and searing himself into popular culture through media appearances and stunts well before he ran for office.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tourists wheeling luggage met head-on with Donald Trump supporters excited to see their idol at Madison Square Garden -- and the result was New York's sidewalks brought to a standstill.</p>

<p>The Empire State Building and the Naked Cowboy guitarist street performer -- both staples of the Manhattan cityscape -- provided a backdrop for a Trump rally held just days before the election.</p>

<p>Eric Milland, 65, from suburban Yonkers said the Republican candidate and former president deserved a warm welcome despite the city being deeply Democratic.</p>

<p>"It's great to see him in New York," said the retiree carrying a cane, who had changed the date on his camouflage Trump hat from 2020 to 2024 with orange pen.</p>

<p>"We are in big trouble, it's a crisis. Immigration is a crisis, our emergency rooms are full," he added, echoing Trump's campaign message.</p>

<p>New York is where Trump made his name as a playboy property developer, emblazoning skyscrapers with his name and searing himself into popular culture through media appearances and stunts well before he ran for office.</p>

<p>On Trump's chances of carrying true blue New York State in the presidential election, Milland said "it'd be a miracle -- but miracles have happened."</p>

<p><strong>Shouting and slurs</strong></p>

<p>The crowded streets near the venue were not without tension on Sunday.</p>

<p>A woman wearing a green North Face puffer jacket screamed abuse at Trump supporters as a film crew captured the scene.</p>

<p>Nearby, a uniformed NYPD police officer haggled with a Trump T-shirt seller, sizing up a "Trump is my savior" shirt before deciding against a purchase.</p>

<p>An anti-Trump demonstrator held up a banner reading "welcome to your Nazi rally," recalling the gathering held by an American Nazi group in 1939 at "the Garden."</p>

<p>Undeterred, a Trump supporter in a stylized black and white US flag hooded sweater posed smiling for a photo with his arm around a companion in front of the banner.</p>

<p>"I hope the terrorists kill you," one man screamed at the vendor of signature red Trump hats and T-shirts commemorating the former president's narrow escape from a sniper's bullet.</p>

<p>Police, Secret Service agents and plainclothes officers swarmed the area, a hive of activity that is home to a rail, subway and bus terminal as well as the 20,000-capacity "MSG" arena.</p>

<p>"We hope people will be happy on November 6" the day after the vote, said retired university professor Salvador, 70, from Barcelona as he and his wife weaved through Trump supporters.</p>

<p>"We wanted to come and see, for me it's interesting. Some people assume that we are against America -- but that's just the leftist politics in Europe," he said before heading to the airport to return home.</p>

<p>Some tourists stumbled into the melee, checking map apps for how to get away as their children surveyed the scene.</p>

<p>Fifty-five-year-old Democratic supporter Laura, who works in the lifestyle sector, had brought her Trump-supporting son to the rally "and then we can talk about it and discuss it later," she said.</p>

<p>"I don't think all Trump people are evil," she said. "Actually the people are a lot more normal than I thought they would be."</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kamala Harris and Donald Trump will make a final push to break their bitter deadlock as they head into the last week of the most dramatic and divisive White House race in modern times.</p>

<p>Despite a series of historic upheavals in a US election like no other, polls show the Democratic vice president and Republican former president remain neck-and-neck in the polls as Election Day on November 5 looms.</p>

<p>Both will pull out all the stops to sway voters, with Harris, 60, giving her closing pitch on Tuesday at the same spot where Trump rallied supporters to protest his election 2020 loss before the deadly January 6, 2021 assault on the US Capitol.</p>

<p>Trump, 78, is also relying on spectacle, and he gave a barnstorming rally at the famed Madison Square Garden arena in his home city of New York on Sunday night to kick off his final effort.</p>

<p>As the race goes down to the wire, the two rivals will hammer the seven battleground states where just a few thousand voters could decide who governs the world's top superpower.</p>

<p>"It's looking like a toss-up," John Mark Hansen, a professor of political science at the University of Chicago, told AFP.</p>

<p>A deeply divided United States will make history either way: by electing its first woman president, or by granting Trump a sensational comeback and putting the first convicted felon and oldest ever commander-in-chief into the Oval Office.</p>

<p><strong>'Crucial time in history'</strong></p>

<p>The choice reflects the starkly different visions offered by Harris, the first female, Black and South Asian vice president, and billionaire tycoon Trump.</p>

<p>Harris at first focused on a message of joy and positivity after her shock replacement of President Joe Biden at the top of the ticket in July, but has since switched to a relentless focus on Trump as a "fascist" who threatens democracy and women's reproductive rights.</p>

<p>The Democrat has pointedly chosen the Ellipse on the National Mall in Washington for her rally exactly a week before Election Day as it is where Trump spoke to supporters to deny his 2020 election defeat by Biden, shortly before they stormed the Capitol.</p>

<p>"This is a very crucial time in history," supporter Kimberly Whittaker said at a Harris rally in Kalamazoo in the battleground state of Michigan.</p>

<p>Trump is expected to reject the result in November if he loses again, raising the specter of chaos and violence in an already tense and deeply polarized United States.</p>

<p>The Republican has doubled down on his extreme rhetoric, with his right-wing base further fueled by Trump surviving two assassination attempts over the summer.</p>

<p>Trump has described migrants as animals, pledged to set up mass deportation camps and threatened to clamp down on domestic opposition, calling them the "enemy from within."</p>

<p>He has also ramped up his pledge to "Make America Great Again" with a focus on the economy, which like immigration remains a top concern for voters.</p>

<p>"I'm probably going to roll with Trump,” said Drew Roby, a 21-year-old health science student from Arizona, who is Black. “Honestly it was better when he was president."</p>

<p><strong>'Very competitive'</strong></p>

<p>At the heart of the race are the seven most hotly contested swing states: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Wisconsin and -- most crucially -- Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>The tightest US presidential election in decades will hinge on who can win over the few remaining undecided voters -- and who can get their base out to vote.</p>

<p>Polls also predict a historic gender gap between the candidates, as well as deep faultlines on race and age.</p>

<p>In the closing days both campaigns will be spending hundreds of millions of dollars on ads while both are also rolling out star surrogates.</p>

<p>Bruce Springsteen and Barack and Michelle Obama have turned out for Harris while on the stump for Trump is tech tycoon Elon Musk.</p>

<p>But Harris may face a bigger challenge overall.</p>

<p>Her campaign had a "better ground game" and more money but Trump "probably still benefits" from a built-in Republican advantage in the idiosyncratic US Electoral College system, said David Karol, who teaches government and politics at the University of Maryland.</p>

<p>“It's very competitive. There's no reason for anybody to be confident."</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A record number of women have been elected to Japan's house of representatives, projections showed Monday, but at less than 16 percent they remain a minority.</p>

<p>Public broadcaster NHK projected that women had won 73 of 465 lower house seats up for grabs, figures expected to be confirmed in official results later in the day.</p>

<p>In Japan's 2021 general election some 45 women were elected to the lower house.</p>

<p>The broadcaster and other outlets had previously reported that a record number of women were running in the election, accounting for around a quarter of candidates.</p>

<p>Women leaders are still rare in business and politics in Japan, which ranked 118 out of 146 in the 2024 World Economic Forum's Global Gender Gap report.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's 20-strong cabinet includes just two women.</p>

<p>In Japan, "political parties are male-oriented and not open-minded, so it's difficult to find female candidates", Momoko Nojo, head of the organisation No Youth No Japan, said last month ahead of the ruling party leadership vote.</p>

<p>"Many women also take on care work at home, which makes it difficult for them to be a politician," added Nojo, who also runs a project to encourage and support women and minorities to enter politics.</p>

<p>A cabinet office survey conducted in 2021 found that among women electoral candidates in Japan, one in four reported facing sexual harassment during their campaigns, according to Jiji Press.</p>

<p>Ishiba's ruling coalition had a disastrous showing in the election on Sunday and is projected to lose its parliamentary majority.</p>

<p>The 67-year-old premier called a vote days after taking office on October 1, but voters angry at a slush fund scandal punished his Liberal Democratic Party (LDP).</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President Joe Biden would celebrate Diwali at the White House Monday evening along with a large number of Indian Americans from across the country.</p>

<p>"Continuing a tradition from previous years, the President will light a Diya lamp in the Blue Room before his remarks," the White House said.</p>

<p>After this he would deliver remarks before a gathering of Indian Americans, for whom he is hosting a reception.</p>

<p>This would be President Biden's last Diwali reception at the White House as he is not running for the presidential election.</p>

<p>"Among the President's introductions will be a video message from Sunita "Suni" Williams, a decorated NASA astronaut and retired Navy Captain. She recorded a video greeting from the International Space Station, where she took over as Commander in September," the White House said.</p>

<p>"Suni is a practising Hindu and has previously sent Diwali greetings from the ISS to people across the globe. She has also brought multiple Indian/Hindu cultural items-including samosas and copies of Upanishads and Bhagavad Gita-with her to space in celebration of her heritage," it said.</p>

<p>"Nootana, a classical South Asian dance and music ensemble based in Washington, DC, will provide musical entertainment for guests, in addition to the Marine Corps Band," said the White House.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Republican Donald Trump led a headline-grabbing New York rally on Sunday with nonstop attacks on Kamala Harris, but Democrats sought to capitalize on crude insults from some of his allies' opening speeches.</p>

<p>Trump took to the stage at the iconic 20,000-seat Madison Square Garden arena to deliver a closing message in the exceedingly tight race for the White House that reaches its apogee on November 5.</p>

<p>"You've destroyed our country. We're not going to take it anymore, Kamala," the 78-year-old told roaring supporters wearing trademark red "Make America Great Again" hats.</p>

<p>Several speakers drew cheers with their own barbs against Harris as well as Puerto Rico and Latinos at the rally in the Democratic stronghold city.</p>

<p>Comedian Tony Hinchcliffe took aim at birthrates among Latinos and called the caribbean US territory Puerto Rico "a floating island of garbage".</p>

<p><strong>'Not a punchline'</strong></p>

<p>Harris, 60, seized on the attacks as she competes with the ex-president to win over Puerto Rican communities in the tight battleground states expected to decide the election.</p>

<p>"Puerto Ricans deserve a president who sees and invests in (their) strength," Harris said in a clip published on social media alongside Hinchcliffe's comments.</p>

<p>Pennsylvania Senator John Fetterman, a Democrat, noted the state is home to almost half a million Puerto Ricans and nearly three quarters are able to vote.</p>

<p>Ricky Martin, the Puerto Rican superstar with 18.6 million followers on Instagram, quickly shared a video of Harris's appeal to Puerto Rican voters, along with a clip of Hinchcliffe's remarks.</p>

<p>"This is what they think of us," Martin wrote in Spanish. "Vote for @kamalaharris."</p>

<p>Puerto Rican singer Bad Bunny also showed support for the vice president by sharing one of her videos to his 45.6 million followers on Instagram.</p>

<p>Trump's rally at "The World's Most Famous Arena" included a surprise appearance by his wife Melania and backers such as billionaire Elon Musk, who has personally hit the campaign trail for the ex-president.</p>

<p>However, the venue also hosted a far-right, pro-Hitler rally in 1939, complete with eagles, Nazi insignia and salutes -- an association that has generated darker headlines.</p>

<p>Professional wrestling legend Hulk Hogan, who also spoke at the Republican convention in July, rejected criticisms of the rally: "I don't see any Nazis in here."</p>

<p><strong>Harris 'boots on ground'</strong></p>

<p>Other speeches also drew concern and criticism, including from Stephen Miller, one of Trump's most hard-right advisors.</p>

<p>"America is for Americans and Americans only," he shouted into the microphone, after pledging a crackdown on cartels and "criminal migrants".</p>

<p>While former Fox News host Tucker Carlson took a mocking shot at Harris's background, calling her "a Samoan Malaysian low I.Q. former California prosecutor".</p>

<p>Harris, meanwhile, charged through a packed day of campaigning in must-win Pennsylvania's largest city, including stops at a Black church, a barbershop and a Puerto Rican restaurant.</p>

<p>With barely a week to go, she was leaving nothing to chance in Philadelphia, where she must run up her vote tally to win the battleground state.</p>

<p>"We must not wake up the day after the election and have any regrets," she told a rally in Philadelphia.</p>

<p>Sunday's visit was the vice president's 14th trip to Pennsylvania since she jumped to the top of the ticket after President Joe Biden's shock withdrawal in July.</p>

<p>"This is the closest and the best opportunity we have to have a female in office who happes to be a Black female," Myrda Scott, from Philadelphia, told AFP at one of Harris's rallies in the city.</p>

<p>Harris rolled up to Philly Cuts barber shop in the largely Black neighborhood of West Philadelphia to meet residents, before ducking into the African-American-themed Hakim's Bookstore &amp; Gift Shop.</p>

<p>"She's boots to the ground," 43-year-old African-American woman Myrda Scott, who runs a financial firm, told AFP as she awaited Harris at a youth basketball rec center rally.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, Harris will hold a major rally in Washington near the White House in the park where Trump fired up his supporters before they stormed the US Capitol to try to overturn the 2020 election result.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's ruling coalition fell short of his declared "victory line" of a majority in snap parliamentary elections, media projections showed Monday.</p>

<p>AFP examines the options now for the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) after its worst result since 2009, and the prospects for its bruised leader Ishiba, who only took office on October 1.</p>

<p><strong>Why the big loss?</strong></p>

<p>Fiercely critical of former prime minister Shinzo Abe and his brand of establishment politics, Ishiba has long played on his relative popularity with voters as the LDP's "intraparty foe".</p>

<p>But while this won him the party leadership, in the election citizens were more interested in punishing the LDP over a scandal that saw party members pocket money from fund-raisers.</p>

<p>That the main opposition Constitutional Democratic Party (CDP) recently elected moderately conservative former prime minister Yoshihiko Noda as leader also didn't help.</p>

<p>"I think the majority of Japanese people trust Noda", said Masato Kamikubo, a politics professor at Ritsumeikan University.</p>

<p>"He is a very stable politician", Kamikubo said.</p>

<p>While the LDP's seats as projected by public broadcaster NHK tumbled to 191, from 259 seats at the last election, the CDP's tally soared to 148 from 96.</p>

<p>Komeito, the LDP's coalition partner, slipped to 24 from 32, with new party chief Keiichi Ishii losing his seat.</p>

<p><strong>Could the opposition form a government?</strong></p>

<p>This is tricky given the fragmented opposition, and memories of its tumultuous rule between 2009 and 2012, analysts say.</p>

<p>"The possibility of a handover of power to the opposition isn't zero, but there are far too many opposition parties for any of them to reach a majority," said Yu Uchiyama, a political science professor at the University of Tokyo.</p>

<p>Policy differences and past fallings-out continue to divide and hobble opposition parties, from communists to the liberal CDP, the centrist Democratic Party for the People (DPP) and the "reformist conservative" Japan Innovation Party.</p>

<p><strong>Can Ishiba find new partners?</strong></p>

<p>The prime minister has his work cut out to make it happen.</p>

<p>On the campaign trail, CDP leader Noda said it would be "impossible" to join forces with the LDP, having been part of previous no-confidence votes.</p>

<p>The Japan Innovation Party also remains unconvinced, with its head Nobuyuki Baba dismissing a tie-up with the LDP in its current scandal-tainted state as "impossible".</p>

<p>The centrist DPP, too, denied it would sign up for the coalition.</p>

<p>But its leader, Yuichiro Tamaki, left open the possibility of a "partial coalition" where it can offer some flexibility on individual policies it has an affinity with.</p>

<p><strong>What about Ishiba's future?</strong></p>

<p>Ishiba will likely therefore have to resort to heading a minority administration, seeking support from other parties on a case-by-case basis.</p>

<p>But this is likely to destabilise Ishiba's nascent power base, and leave him susceptible to challenges from within his own party.</p>

<p>Speculation is growing that Ishiba may be forced to resign to take responsibility for the debacle -- becoming the shortest-serving prime minister in Japan's post-war history.</p>

<p>In a nuanced denial of this prospect, though, Ishiba on Sunday night answered in the affirmative when asked by a reporter whether the prime minister intends to follow through on his duties.</p>

<p>"If the ruling coalition or even just the LDP loses its majority, Ishiba will face harsh criticism from party members", Yosuke Sunahara of Kobe University told AFP before Sunday.</p>

<p>But at the same time, the ruling coalition's loss of a majority in the Lower House only goes to lay bare public disenchantment with the political funding scandal.</p>

<p>So if "Ishiba is ousted while the party tries to gloss over the issue, public backlash against the LDP will intensify," Sunahara said.</p>

<p>"This makes it difficult for Ishiba's rivals within the party to criticise him."</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Within a few short weeks, Kamala Harris created an election campaign out of nothing. She held rapturous rallies, raised more than $1 billion in funds and brought what she called a burst of joy to a party that had given up hope.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The call that upended everything for Kamala Harris came on a Sunday morning in July as the US vice president did a jigsaw puzzle at home with her grand-nieces.</p>

<p>"The phone rings, and it's Joe," Harris told radio host Howard Stern recently. "I got up to take the call -- and then life changed."</p>

<p>President Joe Biden's revelation that he was going to drop out of the 2024 White House race and endorse Harris as the Democratic nominee triggered one of the most remarkable transformations in American politics.</p>

<p>Harris was previously saddled with record-low approval ratings for a "veep."</p>

<p>Within a few short weeks she created an election campaign out of nothing. She held rapturous rallies, raised more than $1 billion in funds and brought what she called a burst of joy to a party that had given up hope.</p>

<p>But with the now polls showing the 60-year-old in a dead heat with Republican former president Donald Trump, Harris is in the fight of her life to win on November 5 and become the first female president in US history.</p>

<p>"It's not easy. Usually people run for president for two years, and she's just been running since late July," David Karol, who teaches government and politics at the University of Maryland, told AFP.</p>

<p><strong>- Difficult debut &nbsp;-</strong></p>

<p>Harris was a trailblazer from the moment she entered the White House as America's first female, Black and South Asian vice president.</p>

<p>Yet the trail proved difficult at first. Harris faced withering criticism that she was not up to the job of being a heartbeat from the presidency.</p>

<p>Already criticized for vagueness on policy during a failed presidential run against Biden in 2019, she increasingly became notorious -- like Biden himself -- for "word salads."</p>

<p>Tasked by Biden with getting to the roots of the country's illegal migration problem, Harris fumbled and granted Republicans an attack line about being a failed "border czar" that they use to this day.</p>

<p>But things began to change in 2022. Harris found her voice when the US Supreme Court overturned the federal right to abortion.</p>

<p>She rallied around the country on the issue and took on an increasingly prominent role in Biden's second presidential campaign -- with officials privately admitting she was gearing up for her own presidential run in 2028.</p>

<p>Biden also increasingly tasked her with diplomatic missions on Ukraine and the Middle East.</p>

<p>But few dreamed that the moment for her to take a tilt at the White House would come so soon.</p>

<p>Partly that was because Harris had long been underestimated, by some Democrats and by Republicans alike.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Trump would soon find that the woman he called "crazy" and subjected to sexist and racist taunts was a force to be reckoned with. In their only debate she gained the upper hand by taunting the former president.</p>

<p><strong>- 'Momala' -</strong></p>

<p>Harris, however has deliberately steered away from overtly leaning into her race or her gender during the campaign.</p>

<p>When she does talk about her personal background it has largely been about her Indian-born mother who raised her and her sister alone -- while her Jamaican-born father rarely gets a mention.</p>

<p>Or there's her very public affection for "Second Gentleman" Doug Emhoff.</p>

<p>Famously his children Cole and Emma, who are now her stepchildren, dubbed her "Momala."</p>

<p>She has also used their relationship to call out Trump's running mate J.D. Vance for previously describing top Democrats as "childless cat ladies."</p>

<p>But it is more common to hear her focus on her professional history as a prosecutor and then as California attorney general -- and contrasting herself with Trump, who's bidding to become the first convicted felon in the Oval Office.</p>

<p>Harris has also repeatedly brought up the fact that's she's a gun owner, as she reaches out to Republican voters.</p>

<p>Yet there have also been familiar weaknesses. She remains uncomfortable with the media, and her failure to sit for any interviews for several weeks mid-campaign drew Republican fire.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The question now is whether she can put the puzzle together and shatter America's highest glass ceiling.</p>

<p>"I think she has run a good campaign. And if she loses, some people will say 'oh, that's because she &nbsp;didn't run a good campaign' -- and I think that's wrong," said Karol.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gerard Depardieu was known for more than 50 years as a titan of French cinema, but details of his crude behaviour and allegations of sexual violence have brought his star low in recent years.</p>

<p>The 75-year-old goes on trial Monday on charges of sexually assaulting two women during a 2021 film shoot.</p>

<p>Depardieu's career spans more than 200 films, making him one of the best-known French faces on the global silver screen.</p>

<p>It has included leading roles in adapted classics of French literature, such as Cyrano de Bergerac and Jean Valjean of "Les Miserables".</p>

<p>Audiences and fellow creatives long appreciated his brash, often deliberately offensive character -- only for those qualities to begin counting against him in recent years.</p>

<p>A 2023 broadcast of images shot five years earlier in North Korea showed Depardieu making misogynistic and sexual remarks about an underage girl.</p>

<p>But while then-Culture Minister Rima Abdul-Malak called the recording a "shame for France", President Emmanuel Macron took Depardieu's defence, saying he remained a "towering actor" who "makes France proud".</p>

<p>Macron's intervention came as Depardieu faced a slew of rape and sexual assault allegations spanning decades.</p>

<p><strong>Crude scenes, big noses</strong></p>

<p>Gerard Depardieu was born December 27, 1948 in Chateauroux, central France.</p>

<p>Although his teenage years were marked by delinquency, he went on to discover the theatre in Paris and appeared in his first film in 1965.</p>

<p>One of Depardieu' breakthrough roles came as a violent small-time crook in 1974's "Les Valseuses" ("Going Places") directed by Bertrand Blier -- a film that drew opprobrium for its on-screen depictions of sexual acts and vulgarity.</p>

<p>The criticisms did nothing to harm Depardieu's career, as he went on to be crowned with France's version of an Oscar, the 1981 Cesar award for "Le dernier metro" ("The last metro") directed by Francois Truffaut.</p>

<p>US magazine Newsweek called Depardieu a "hero with a thousand faces" in 1987 as he was on a run of films that peaked with 1990's "Cyrano de Bergerac", directed by Jean-Paul Rappeneau.</p>

<p>Depardieu bagged a second Cesar and the Cannes festival's acting award for his appearance as the titular big-nosed, versifying nobleman in a classic French tale of unrequited love.</p>

<p>He launched an adventure into Hollywood in the early 90s with efforts like "Green Card" and "1492".</p>

<p>But even then, past utterances in which he appeared to confess to committing "rapes" as a young man surfaced in Time magazine.</p>

<p>Depardieu claimed that his words had been mistranslated, but the affair undermined his Californian ambitions.</p>

<p>The late 90s and early 2000s brought commercial success with live-action adaptations of the Asterix comic books and dramas like police thriller "36, Quai des Orfevres", but the actor did not reach his previous artistic heights.</p>

<p>Now a vineyard owner known for his love of rich food, Depardieu made headlines for outbursts and offensive or even violent behaviour, especially towards women.</p>

<p><strong>Allegations catch up</strong></p>

<p>Long written off as being down to his unique character, some allegations eventually made it into the justice system.</p>

<p>Depardieu was charged in 2020 with raping actor Charlotte Arnould, then in her 20s, multiple times, which he has denied.</p>

<p>A second actor, Helene Darras, filed a criminal complaint for sexual assault, but the case was dropped as it had passed the statute of limitations.</p>

<p>Where Depardieu's antics -- such as urinating on board a plane in 2011 -- had once drawn laughs, he now became a liability.</p>

<p>Studios removed him from publicity campaigns for his films before putting his career on hold in late 2023.</p>

<p>Pleading before the court of public opinion, he swore that he was "neither a rapist nor a predator" in an open letter.</p>

<p>"I've been provocative, excessive, sometimes crude throughout my life... if when I thought I was living intensely in the present moment, I have hurt or shocked anyone at all, I never meant to do harm and I apologise," Depardieu wrote.</p>

<p>Beyond his legal woes, Depardieu has appeared to shun France in favour of authoritarian governments from North Korea to Cuba and Algeria in recent years.</p>

<p>He announced in 2012 that he would give up his French nationality, living as a tax exile in Belgium and acquiring Russian citizenship.</p>

<p>Until Moscow's 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Depardieu was full of praise for Russian President Vladimir Putin.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The top commander of Iran's Revolutionary Guards has warned Israel it would face "bitter consequences" after its attack on Iranian military sites, local media said on Monday.</p>

<p>Guards chief Hossein Salami, quoted by Tasnim news agency, said Israel had "failed to achieve its ominous goals" with its air raids on Saturday.</p>

<p>Israel struck military sites in response to Tehran's October 1 missile attack, itself retaliation for the killing of Iran-backed militant leaders and a Revolutionary Guards commander.</p>

<p>Salami said the Israeli attack was a sign of "miscalculation and helplessness" as Israel battles Tehran-aligned militants in Gaza and Lebanon.</p>

<p>"Its bitter consequences will be unimaginable" for Israel, Salami warned according to Tasnim.</p>

<p>Iranian media have played down the severity of the Israeli operation, signalling what analysts say is the Islamic republic's reluctance to escalate further.</p>

<p>Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Sunday said that Israel's attack which killed four soldiers "should neither be exaggerated nor minimised".</p>

<p>He described it as a "miscalculation" on Israel's part.</p>

<p>President Masoud Pezeshkian said: "We do not seek war but we will defend the rights of our nation and country."</p>

<p>Iran "will give an appropriate response to the aggression of the Zionist regime," Pezeshkian added.</p>

<p>Also on Sunday, Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi reiterated Iran's "right to respond", also saying that Tehran had "received indications" hours before Israel's attack.</p>

<p>US news website Axios on Saturday said Israel has "sent message to Iran" ahead of its attack and warned it "against a response".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[As hordes of supporters gathered at the Madison Square Garden, former president Donald Trump and an armada of 29 speakers rained insults on Kamala Harris, Latinos and Puerto Ricans at a 'Make America Great Again' rally.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As hordes of supporters gathered inside and outside the Madison Square Garden less than a week before the US election, former president Donald Trump returned to the city that established him as a flamboyant property developer, who found his place in popular culture through media appearances and stunts well before he ran for office in 2020.</p>

<p>Trump returned to New York with an armada of supporting speakers, even as political experts dubbed the chances of the rally flipping the blue state as a "miracle".</p>

<p>Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance,&nbsp;four-time Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard, New York City Mayor&nbsp;Rudy Giuliani, Ultimate Fighting Championship CEO Dana White,&nbsp;comedian and host of "Kill Tony" podcast Tony Hinchcliffe, former WWE wrestler Hulk Hogan and Robert F Kennedy Jr were among the 30 speakers apart from Trump.</p>

<p><strong>Here are the key statements by speakers at the Make America Great again rally in New York:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>“Kamala (Harris), you're fired!” Mr. Trump said, returning to the line that he first made famous as host of “The Apprentice.”</li>
	<li>"You've destroyed our country. We're not going to take it anymore, Kamala," the 78-year-old Trump told rally attendees.</li>
	<li>"We will rapidly defeat inflation, and we will very simply make America affordable again," Trump said.</li>
	<li>In a confrontation with China, “we will kick their ass”, Trump said, asserting, “We have the greatest military in the world”.</li>
	<li>He said that if he were the president, Russia would not have invaded Ukraine or Hamas attacked Israel. “Ukraine was the apple of his (Putin's) eye, but I said, Vladimir, don't go in,” Trump said.</li>
	<li>“This is the city where I was born and raised, and this is the town that taught me that Americans can do anything,” he said, while talking about New York City.</li>
	<li>“We bleed the same blood. we share the same hope. we are one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God,” he said.</li>
	<li>Elon Musk claimed that he would cut $2 trillion from the current federal budget of $6.5 trillion.&nbsp;“Your money is being wasted,” Musk . “We're going to get the government off your back and out of your pocket book.”</li>
	<li>"There's literally a floating island of garbage in the middle of the ocean right now. I think it's called Puerto Rico," said Tony Hinchcliffe. He went on to&nbsp;mock Hispanics as failing to use birth control, Jews as cheap and Palestinians as rock-throwers.</li>
	<li>“I don't take a risk with people that are taught to kill Americans at 2,” Rudy Guiliani said. “I'm on the side of Israel.”</li>
	<li>Tucker Carlson, a former Fox News talk show host, ridiculed Harris, whose mother is Indian, as “a Samoan, Malaysian, low-IQ”.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>An iconic venue with a dark history</strong></p>

<p>Home to some of the biggest events in history, the 20,000-seat arena has seen iconic performances by the Rolling Stones, Madonna, Frank Sinatra, Marilyn Monroe and U2, apart from appearances by two popes and "the Greatest" Muhammad Ali. Its darker history though includes a far-right rally in 1939, complete with eagles, Nazi insignia and Hitler salutes. Around 20,000 US-based Nazi sympathizers gathered under the banner of "Americanization," denouncing Jewish "conspiracies" and then-president Franklin D. Roosevelt, sparking fierce counter-protests outside.&nbsp;A week later, tens of thousands attended a communist rally at the Garden.</p>

<p>The Garden has also&nbsp;Democratic and Republican National Conventions since the 1800s, while&nbsp;Marilyn Monroe took the stage in 1962 to sing “Happy Birthday” to President John F Kennedy.</p>

<p>This Garden was also the site of the 1976, 1980 and 1992 Democratic National Conventions and the 2004 Republican National Convention, according to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/26/nyregion/trump-rally-msg-protest-nazi.html">New York Times</a>.&nbsp;Jimmy Carter&nbsp;referred to the Vietnam War and the Watergate scandal as he accepted his nomination.&nbsp;Carter returned in 1980, bagging another nomination.&nbsp;As Democrats met again in 1992, Bill Clinton accepted his nomination.&nbsp;The only Republican Party&nbsp;convention held at Madison Square Garden convention was in 2004, when New York was&nbsp;reeling from the 9/11&nbsp;attacks at the World Trade Center.&nbsp;“We will build a safer world and a more hopeful America, and nothing will hold us back,” President George W Bush had said.</p>

<p>The arena&nbsp;hosted both Herbert Hoover and Franklin Delano Roosevelt in their campaigns.&nbsp;Roosevelt beat Hoover, then spoke at the Garden again during his 1936 and 1940 campaigns.&nbsp;“Never before in all our history have these forces been so united against one candidate as they stand today,” Roosevelt said. “They are unanimous in their hate for me — and I welcome their hatred.”</p>

<p>However, among the most chaotic political events was the 1924 Democratic Convention, where the party took 16 days and 103 votes to pick a candidate.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iraq has condemned Israel's use of its airspace to attack neighbouring Iran in a protest letter sent to United Nations chief Antonio Guterres and the UN Security Council, Baghdad said Monday.</p>

<p>A statement from government spokesman Bassim Alawadi said the letter condemns "the Zionist entity's blatant violation of Iraq's airspace and sovereignty by using Iraqi airspace to carry out an attack on the Islamic Republic of Iran on October 26".</p>

<p>Alawadi said the Iraqi foreign ministry would also bring up "this violation" in talks with the United States, Israel's close ally and top arms provider.</p>

<p>Israel on Saturday launched air strikes on military sites in Iran, risking further regional escalation more than a year into the Gaza war and a month into the Israel-Hezbollah war in Lebanon.</p>

<p>The Israeli raid was in retaliation to an Iranian missile attack on October 1, itself retaliation for the killing of Iran-backed militant leaders and a Revolutionary Guards commander.</p>

<p>The Iranian military said that some Israeli aircraft had fired a "small number of long-range missiles... from a distance", inside the US-patrolled airspace of Iraq.</p>

<p>Baghdad has close ties with Tehran but also a strategic partnership with Washington, which has troops in Iraq as part of an international anti-jihadist coalition.</p>

<p>While the Iraqi government has sought to avoid being dragged into the escalating regional conflict, some pro-Iran factions have launched attacks on US forces in the region and claimed responsibility for drones sent to Israel.</p>

<p>One Tehran-aligned group, the influential Kataeb Hezbollah, condemned on Sunday the Israeli use of Iraqi airspace to attack Iran as a "dangerous precedent".</p>

<p>It accused the United States of being complicit in the Israeli attack, warning both of a response to this "aggression".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said on Sunday he had "received indications" hours before Israel launched an attack on military sites.</p>

<p>"We had received indications since the evening about the possibility of an attack that night," Araghchi told reporters without specifying the nature of the indications.</p>

<p>On Saturday, Israel carried out air strikes on military sites in Iran in response to Tehran's October 1 attack, itself retaliation for the killing of Iran-backed militant leaders and a Revolutionary Guards commander.</p>

<p>Araghchi said the "necessary measures" were taken when the attack unfolded, adding that he had been in contact with military officials and that "messages were also exchanged with different parties" whom he did not name.</p>

<p>The foreign minister emphasised in his remarks that the Islamic republic has the "right to respond".</p>

<p>US news website Axios on Saturday said Israel has "sent message to Iran" ahead of its attack and warned it "against a response".</p>

<p>Axios, citing anonymous sources, said the message "was an attempt to limit the ongoing exchange of attacks between Israel and Iran and prevent a wider escalation".</p>

<p>Earlier on Sunday, President Masoud Pezeshkian said Iran does "not seek war but we will defend the rights of our nation and country".</p>

<p>Pezeshkian added that Iran "will give an appropriate response to the aggression of the Zionist regime".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Let PM Modi bring back 1,000 Ukrainian children at least, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says in an interview.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said he believes Prime Minister Narendra Modi can help end the war with Russia. “This is the huge value of him in any conflict. This is a huge value of India,” he said in <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUkmGyn_SSk" rel="nofollow,noindex">an exclusive interview with the Times of India</a>.</p>

<p>At the recent BRICS Summit, PM Modi had expressed his desire to work for peace in the context of the Ukraine war. Sharing his thoughts on the Prime Minister's speech, Zelenskyy said, “Modi is the PM of a really huge country - from the perspective of population, impact, influence and economy. Such a country cannot just say that it is interested in the end of a war. We are all interested in that. All of the leaders will tell you tomorrow that they would like to end the war… this is a very common thing, especially for such a huge country as India.”</p>

<p>Countries like India could easily facilitate the end of the war by blocking the Russian economy, the Ukraine president stressed.</p>

<p>“Real influence on blocking of the Russian economy, blocking of cheap energy resource, blocking of the defence-industrial complex of Russia will lead to the decrease in capacity of Moscow to wage wars against us,” he said. “Twenty great economies can put Putin in his place to end the war. They can do that. Not just incentivizing it but vice versa to slow down all of his desires and you don't need to say we would like peace. You need to act because daily war is killing people,” he added.</p>

<p>On what India can do specifically for Ukrainian children, he said PM Modi should bring back at least 1,000 children who were forcibly deported. “You can join the coalition of the bring back of children. You can call Putin and ask him who he is. You can force him to bring the children back. Prime Minister Modi can do that. He has really huge influence. He can just say specifically, how many Ukrainian children will be given to me so that I can bring them back to Ukraine. Just say that directly. Give me 1,000 children who will be brought back to Ukraine. This is the real step. Let PM Modi bring back only 1,000 at least,” he said.</p>

<p>If every such influential person as Prime Minister Modi can bring back 1,000, we will be able to bring back the majority of our children, said Zelenskyy, that's what's needed to be done.</p>

<p>“You need to raise this issue at the G20 meet,” he added.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte strongly defended his deadly drug war as he testified on Monday at a senate probe of the crackdown.</p>

<p>Police said the campaign left more than 6,000 people dead, but rights groups estimate tens of thousands of mostly poor men were killed by officers and vigilantes, often without proof they were linked to drugs.</p>

<p>The International Criminal Court (ICC) is investigating allegations that the killings were a state-sanctioned "crime against humanity".</p>

<p>"Do not question my policies because I offer no apologies, no excuses. I did what I had to do, and whether or not you believe it or not, I did it for my country," Duterte, 79, said in an opening statement at the public hearing.</p>

<p>"I hate drugs, make no mistake about it."</p>

<p>During the anti-drug campaign he launched shortly after taking office in 2016, Duterte ordered police to shoot dead suspects if officers believed their lives were in danger.</p>

<p>While the crackdown has been widely condemned and sparked an international investigation, only nine police officers have been convicted for killing drug suspects.</p>

<p>The drug war has continued under Duterte's successor, Ferdinand Marcos, though he has pushed for more emphasis on prevention and rehabilitation.</p>

<p>While the current and former president have had a bitter falling out, Marcos has stressed his government will not cooperate with the ICC investigation.</p>

<p>The Philippines quit the ICC in 2019 on Duterte's instructions, but the tribunal has said it has jurisdiction over killings before the pullout, as well as killings in the southern city of Davao when Duterte was mayor there, years before he became president.</p>

<p>Duterte claimed Monday that "drug-related crimes are on the rise again", with daily reports of "children being raped, people getting killed" because "the purveyors of this menace are back in business".</p>

<p>"The Filipinos are anxious and distressed," he added.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[When Ms Voyek first met Coolack, she found him charismatic and charming, saying he knew exactly what to say to make her feel at ease.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A woman from the US' Idaho has come forward with a disturbing account of a blind date with a man who claimed to be a fugitive wanted for murder in Texas. According to <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.fox19.com/2024/10/22/woman-says-man-she-had-blind-date-with-confessed-he-was-wanted-murder-another-state/">Fox19</a></em>, Janey Voyek met the man, James Coolack, through her brother Eddie, who had met him on the side of the road and offered him help. Her brother even gave Coolack a job, unaware of his troubled past.</p>

<p>When Ms Voyek first met Coolack, she found him charismatic and charming, saying he knew exactly what to say to make her feel at ease. However, their encounter took a dark turn on Saturday when Coolack's demeanour changed and he confessed to being wanted for murder in Texas. Ms Voyek shared her harrowing experience, warning others about the dangers of trusting strangers, even if they seem charming and charismatic.</p>

<p>''He just kind of got mad and crazy, and just bluntly told me that he had murdered his brother two years ago,'' Ms Voyek said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>She then immediately reached out to her brother, Eddie, who confronted Coolack about the claim. Coolack repeated the confession, prompting Eddie to contact the authorities.</p>

<p>The Calhoun County Sheriff's Office located Coolack on Sunday morning, walking along State Highway 4 outside Pomeroy. He was detained, and his identity was verified, confirming the outstanding murder warrant. Coolack is currently being held at the Carroll County jail, awaiting extradition to Houston.</p>

<p>According to the Houston Police Department, Coolack is accused of fatally shooting his brother in March 2022 and has been evading law enforcement ever since.&nbsp;</p>

<p>''There was this sense of closure in this case once he was apprehended.&nbsp;I did believe that it was only a matter of time before he was apprehended. I'm just happy to help them get the closure and they rest at ease that now Kyle is locked up and nobody else is in danger,'' Sgt. Cullen Duncan, who is with the Houston Police Department, said.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Ms Voyek is still grappling with anger and unease following her encounter with Coolack. She said that she has learned a valuable lesson from this incident and is now urging others to exercise caution when engaging with people they don't know well.</p>

<p>''Just be careful what you do and who you talk to, and don't rush to let somebody in your home,” she said.</p>

<p>She feels things could've taken a turn for the worse if the truth hadn't come out when it did.</p>

<p>''Would he have beat me? Would he have tried anything with me and essentially killed me? And there are times that I wonder if it could have went there,'' she added.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Record 56 people have so far died on the France-Britain route across the Channel in 2024.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An Indian man died on Sunday after a migrant boat sank during an attempt to cross the Channel to Britain, French officials said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Indian was in a group that had set off from the beach of Tardinghen in northern France but died when the boat, which was in "very poor condition", deflated "immediately" after leaving the beach, officials said.</p>

<p>Not all the passengers had life jackets, but most on board were able to swim back to shore.</p>

<p>The man, around 40 years old, was in "cardio-respiratory arrest" and could not be revived by emergency services, officials said.</p>

<p>At least 56 people have so far died on the France-Britain route across the Channel in 2024.</p>

<p>Last week, two men and a woman were killed when their boat was wrecked around two kilometres offshore near the port city of Calais. Some 35 people were rescued when screams were heard on the boat.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, a four-month-old baby died when an overloaded migrant boat headed for Britain sank in the English Channel off the coast of France.&nbsp;Sixty-eight people were rescued when the accident occurred in the French town of Wissant on October 17.</p>

<p>Prosecutors said the infant, aged four months and possibly from Iraqi Kurdistan, was on board with his parents and two other children.</p>

<p>According to officials, over 29,000 migrants have made it across the Channel since the start of 2024.</p>

<p>Migrants also try to hide in trucks to get through the heavily guarded tunnel linking France and Britain.</p>

<p>Channel crossings to Britain by undocumented asylum seekers have increased since 2018 despite repeated warnings about the perilous journey.</p>

<p>The English Channel has heavy maritime traffic, icy waters and strong currents.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US Vice President Kamala Harris and former president Donald Trump are hurtling toward their November 5 election showdown, one of the closest contests in modern American history.</p>

<p>And in the handful of critical states framing the 2024 race, there is little daylight between the rivals with barely a week before Election Day.</p>

<p>Under the US Constitution, America's founding fathers established that each of the 50 states would hold its own vote for president.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Under the complex Electoral College system, each state has a certain number of "electors," based on population. Most states have a winner-take-all system that awards all electors to whoever wins the popular vote.</p>

<p>With candidates needing 270 of the 538 electoral votes to win, elections tend to be decided in the hotly contested "swing states" with a history of alternating between Republican and Democratic candidates.</p>

<p>This year, there are seven such battlegrounds, and every one is a toss-up within the margin of error. Here is a look:</p>

<p><strong>Pennsylvania (19 Electoral College votes)</strong></p>

<p>Pennsylvania was once reliably Democratic, but these days, they don't come much tighter than the Keystone State.</p>

<p>Republican Trump won the most populous battleground, with 13 million residents, by 0.7 percentage points in 2016. Joe Biden claimed it by 1.2 percentage points in 2020.</p>

<p>Known for its "Rust Belt" cities like Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania has been blighted for decades by the steady decline of its industrial manufacturing base.</p>

<p>Trump and Harris have campaigned repeatedly in the eastern state, where the pair held their one and only presidential debate. Trump, who survived an assassination attempt at a July rally in Pennsylvania, is courting the rural white population and warning that migrants are overwhelming small towns.</p>

<p>Harris is touting recent infrastructure wins, and in Pittsburgh she outlined plans to invest $100 billion in manufacturing, a key issue for state residents.</p>

<p><strong>Georgia (16)</strong></p>

<p>This southeastern state was an election flashpoint at the end of Trump's first term, and the controversy simmers.</p>

<p>Prosecutors in Georgia indicted Trump in an election interference case after he called state officials urging them to "find" enough votes to overturn Biden's narrow 2020 victory.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But in a boost for Trump, the case is paused until after the election.</p>

<p>Biden was the first Democrat to win the Peach State since 1992. Demographic changes are likely to benefit Harris, who has courted minority voters across Georgia.</p>

<p><strong>North Carolina (16)</strong></p>

<p>The southeastern state has voted Democratic only once since 1980, but Harris believes it's back in play.</p>

<p>The population, now over 10 million, is expanding and growing more diverse, benefiting Democrats.</p>

<p>Complicating matters for Trump, a scandal involving the state's Republican gubernatorial candidate has infuriated party officials who worry it could sink Trump in a close race.</p>

<p>As in neighboring Georgia, one wild card is how the devastation from storm Helene, which recently laid waste to towns in western North Carolina, might impact the vote.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Michigan (15)</strong></p>

<p>Trump flipped Michigan, a former Democratic stronghold, on his way to defeating Hillary Clinton in 2016.</p>

<p>Biden returned it to the blue column in 2020, buoyed by unionized workers and a large Black community.</p>

<p>But this time, Harris risks losing the support of a 200,000-strong Arab-American community that has denounced Biden's -- and by extension her -- handling of the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.</p>

<p><strong>Arizona (11)</strong></p>

<p>The Grand Canyon state was among 2020's tightest races, with Biden triumphing by just 10,457 votes.</p>

<p>Trump hopes frustrations over the Biden-Harris administration's immigration policy will swing Arizona, which shares a border with Mexico, back in his favor.</p>

<p>Harris visited Arizona's border in September vowing to crack down on migration and work on reviving last year's bipartisan border bill, which she said Trump "tanked" for political purposes.</p>

<p><strong>Wisconsin (10)</strong></p>

<p>Clinton lost Wisconsin after giving the state a wide berth during the 2016 campaign.</p>

<p>As with Midwestern neighbor Michigan, it was a different story when Trump's opponent was Biden, who turned a 23,000-vote deficit into a winning margin of 21,000 for Democrats.</p>

<p>Trump considers it winnable, and his party held its summer national convention there.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While Trump led early against Biden, Harris has made the state race a nailbiter.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Nevada (6)</strong></p>

<p>The Silver State, with a population of 3.1 million, hasn't voted Republican since 2004. Conservatives, buoyed by Trump's headway with Hispanic voters, are convinced they can flip the script.</p>

<p>Trump held a significant lead here against Biden.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But within weeks of becoming the Democratic nominee, Harris -- promoting her economic plans to help small businesses and combat inflation -- has erased that advantage in the western state, whose largest city Las Vegas is dominated by the hospitality industry.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Nearly three years after Russian forces invaded Ukraine, many medical facilities in war-battered eastern Ukraine have been damaged or destroyed, while those left untouched are overcrowded.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It looks like an ordinary train waiting to depart an ordinary station, but through its fogged windows, a Ukrainian serviceman with face injuries lies stretched out on a gurney.</p>

<p>All of the other blue-and-yellow carriages of this train operated by the military are carrying wounded soldiers to hospitals away from the precarious front line.</p>

<p>Nearly three years after Russian forces invaded Ukraine, many medical facilities in war-battered eastern Ukraine have been damaged or destroyed, while those left untouched are overcrowded.</p>

<p>For Oleksandr, the army doctor overseeing the evacuation, there are clear benefits to rail: many people can be moved at once and it is safer than transporting wounded soldiers by helicopter, given Russian superiority in Ukraine's airspace.</p>

<p>But there are risks too.</p>

<p>"Our adversary in the war does not distinguish between what's medical and military, so we take certain security measures," the 46-year-old said.</p>

<p>AFP was recently granted rare media access to the train, whose points of departure and arrival are not being disclosed for security reasons.</p>

<p><strong>'Everything on the move'</strong></p>

<p>Ambulances arrived at the station carrying dozens of wounded troops who were then hauled onto the train on stretchers and settled on beds with floral-patterned sheets.</p>

<p>Ukrainian flags and hand-drawn pictures by children annotated with patriotic messages lined the walls inside the train.</p>

<p>The carriages resemble a hospital until the train rolls away from the platform and gently rocks patients and staff -- and everything else inside -- as it crawls farther from the front.</p>

<p>"We do everything on the move, everything. Starting from the usual intravenous injections, ending with incubations," said Viktorya, a nurse dressed in khaki and wearing blue medical gloves.</p>

<p>"We get dizzy afterwards," the 25-year-old said, standing in front of a window, the sweeping Ukrainian landscape rolling by.</p>

<p>The journeys to and from the front, where Ukraine is coming under increasing pressure, have given Viktorya a painful insight into the cost of the conflict grinding through its third year.</p>

<p>"I understand the number of wounded now. It's very hard to see it every day," she said.</p>

<p>Kyiv -- like Moscow -- is tight-lipped about its soldier casualty count.</p>

<p>President Volodymyr Zelensky in February said the number of Ukrainian servicemen confirmed killed was around 31,000 -- a figure observers say is likely an underestimate -- but the number of missing and wounded has never been disclosed.</p>

<p><strong>Worried about others</strong></p>

<p>Most of those wounded were struck in artillery or drone attacks, staff explained, and many have had arms or legs amputated or were unconscious.</p>

<p>One carriage is designated for patients who have been in intensive care and doctors can even operate on patients in case of "force majeure," doctor Oleksandr said.</p>

<p>Things can go wrong and mass bleeding -- an unpredictable and rapid killer -- is a major concern for staff.</p>

<p>"Staff are always near the patient," Oleksandr explained, adding that they take turns using the toilet or eating.</p>

<p>Despite the logistical issues around caregiving on moving trains, the wounded soldiers' preoccupations lie elsewhere.</p>

<p>"Their psychological state is not good," Olena, a medical staff worker, told AFP.</p>

<p>"They're not worried about losing a limb or whatever else. What depresses them is how their comrades are and how their family is," Olena added.</p>

<p><strong>'A sigh of relief'</strong></p>

<p>One Ukrainian serviceman on the train was being treated for a gunshot wound after being caught in a Russian ambush that also killed one of his fellow soldiers.</p>

<p>"Four of us left but not all of us returned," the 28-year-old who identified himself as Murchyk said.</p>

<p>But he was already gauging when he might be able to make his way back to the front, where Ukraine's outnumbered forces have been ceding ground to determined Russian advances.</p>

<p>Whether Murchyk can return to combat will be decided by a medical commission, but he said he was clear-eyed about his wish.</p>

<p>"I'd like to go back," he told AFP.</p>

<p>The train evacuations in Ukraine began when the war did, in February 2022.</p>

<p>It revives a process used in World War II, with several refitted trains now taking wounded troops from the front.</p>

<p>When Oleksandr's train arrives at its destination, ambulances are already waiting for the patients to be loaded off and taken onwards to hospital.</p>

<p>"It is of course very stressful and yes, you breathe a sigh of relief when you arrive and unload," he said, "when you see that all the ambulances have left, when the platform is empty and the train is empty."</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

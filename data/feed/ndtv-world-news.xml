       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Democratic leaders rallied Sunday behind US President Joe Biden following his poor debate performance last week, as the White House denied a report he was meeting with family to assess his candidacy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>No major party figures have broken ranks to call for Biden to step down, with prominent Democrats including past presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton voicing full-throated support amid a torrent of doubts from everyday Americans -- and even a call from the New York Times editorial board to move aside.</p>

<p>The wave of party backing follows the 81-year-old's stumbling performance Thursday in the debate against Republican candidate Donald Trump, in which Biden often hesitated, tripped over words and lost his train of thought, highlighting concerns about his age.</p>

<p>"It's not about performance in terms of a debate, it's about performance in a presidency," Representative Nancy Pelosi, the former House speaker, told CNN's "State of the Union" on Sunday.</p>

<p>On "one side of the screen, you have integrity, the other side you have dishonesty," she said, echoing a number of party figures attempting to shift the focus from what they say was Biden's unfortunate performance to the barrage of lies that came from Donald Trump during the debate.</p>

<p>According to a CBS News poll conducted in the two days following the debate, nearly three-quarters of registered voters now believe Biden should not be running for president, including 46 percent of Democrats.</p>

<p>Biden and his family traveled to the Camp David presidential retreat late Saturday, where NBC News reported he was expected to assess the future of his reelection campaign following his performance.</p>

<p>White House senior deputy press secretary Andrew Bates, however, posted on X that the trip had been planned since before the debate, questioning the publication and claiming it had failed to ask for comment on the matter.</p>

<h3><strong>'Only Democrat' for the job</strong></h3>

<p>The Biden campaign has meanwhile reported that it has raised $33 million since the debate, including $26 million from grassroots donors.</p>

<p>Biden should "absolutely not" drop out of the race, Georgia Senator Raphael Warnock told NBC's "Meet the Press" on Sunday.</p>

<p>"It's our assignment to make sure that he gets over the finish line come November. Not for his sake but the country's sake."</p>

<p>On Friday, Biden attempted to tamp down the nay-saying with a fiery campaign speech in North Carolina in which he pledged to keep fighting.</p>

<p>He appeared alongside his wife, First Lady Jill Biden, who has fiercely defended her husband amid calls for him to step aside.</p>

<p>"On that campaign stage in North Carolina, I saw a forceful, engaged and capable Joe Biden," Democratic Senator Chris Coons, from Biden's home state of Delaware, said Sunday on ABC's "This Week."</p>

<p>"I think it was a weak debate performance by President Biden," Coons said, adding that nonetheless "side by side, Donald Trump had a horrifying debate performance where, yes, he spoke plainly, but what he said was lie after lie after lie."</p>

<p>Biden, he added, is "the only Democrat who can beat Donald Trump."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[She was arrested after an investigation revealed that she allegedly began sexually abusing her student earlier this year.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A special education teacher at an intermediate school in New Jersey was arrested for an alleged sexual relationship with a student, according to authorities.&nbsp;43-year-old&nbsp;Allison Havemann-Niedrach&nbsp;at Freehold Intermediate School was charged with first-degree aggravated sexual assault and endangering the welfare of a child, Monmouth County <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://mcponj.org/2024/06/29/intermediate-school-teacher-charged-with-engaging-in-sexual-relationship-with-student/">Prosecutor Raymond S. Santiago announced.</a></p>

<p>According to the<em> <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/06/29/us-news/nj-special-ed-teacher-accused-of-sexually-assaulting-student-prosecutor/">New York Post</a></em>, she was&nbsp;arrested earlier this week after an&nbsp;investigation revealed that she allegedly began sexually abusing her student earlier this year. However, authorities did not say how the conduct came to light or how many times she had assaulted the student. The age of the alleged victim has also not been revealed,&nbsp;but grades six through eight attend Freehold Intermediate School.</p>

<p>She is currently being held at the Monmouth County jail in Freehold Township, pending a first appearance and detention hearing. A hearing will be conducted to determine whether she will continue to be detained while awaiting trial.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The prosecutor's office asked members of the public to provide more information about her activities. ''Anyone with information about Havemann-Niedrach's activities is being urged to contact MCPO Detective Dawn Correia at 800-533-7443,'' the release read.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As per her <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/allison-havemann-niedrach-b2108653/">LinkedIn profile</a>, Havemann-Niedrach has been a special education teacher at Freehold Intermediate School since March 2022. She has been a teacher or a substitute teacher at several schools dating back to 2008, according to her profile.</p>

<p>The teacher describes herself as: "Passionate, results-driven, and sincere educator. Poised and competent and thrives in performance-driven environments. Demonstrated history of a 'do what it takes' work ethic and truly differentiated instruction."</p>

<p>After the arrest, Asia Michael, the superintendent of the Freehold Borough School District&nbsp;sent an email to staff and parents that read, ''We have been informed that a former staff member has been arrested on allegations of third-degree aggravated sexual assault and inappropriate sexual conduct with a minor.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Please be assured that our district has been fully cooperative with the prosecutor's office since the outset of this investigation. The safety and well-being of our students and staff have been our top priority, and we took immediate measures to ensure their protection.''</p>

<p>The teacher's attorney, meanwhile, said in a statement that she ''maintains her innocence'' and refused to comment further.&nbsp;</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on Sunday met Qatar's Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani in Doha and reviewed bilateral relationship, with a focus on political, trade, investment, energy, technology, culture and people-to-people ties.</p>

<p>Mr Jaishankar, who arrived here on a day-long visit, also exchanged views on regional and global issues with Sheikh Mohammed, who also holds the portfolio as Foreign Minister.</p>

<p>"Delighted to meet PM and FM of Qatar @MBA_AlThani_ in Doha this afternoon. Conveyed the greetings and warm wishes of PM @narendramodi to H.H. The Amir and him," Mr Jaishankar said in a post in X.</p>

<p>"Reviewed our bilateral relationship focusing on political, trade, investment, energy, technology, culture and people-to-people ties. Exchanged views on regional and global issues. Appreciate his sharing insights on the Gaza situation," he said.</p>

<p>"Look forward to the further enhancement of India-Qatar relations and continued dialogue on issues of mutual interest," he added.</p>

<p>Mr Jaishankar's visit comes four-and-half months after Qatar released eight former Indian Navy personnel, who were sentenced to death after being arrested in August 2022.</p>

<p>Earlier in the day, Mr Jaishankar was received at the airport by Chief of Protocol Ibrahim Fakhroo.</p>

<p>The visit would "enable both sides to review various aspects of bilateral relations, including political, trade, investment, energy, security, cultural and people-to-people as well as the regional and international issues of mutual interest," the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said in New Delhi on Saturday.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Qatar from February 14 to 15 and held discussions with Qatar's Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani.</p>

<p>"India and Qatar share historic and friendly relations which are marked by regular exchange of high-level visits," the MEA said.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A "swarm" of Ukrainian drones targeted Russian steelmaker Novolipetsk Steel's facility in a raid in the early hours of Sunday, but it sustained no serious damage, a company spokesperson said.</p>

<p>The attack achieved no results other than causing extra welding work, the spokesperson said. Igor Artamonov, the governor of the Lipetsk region in western Russia where the steel mill is located, said in a separate statement that nine drones had been downed over the steel mill.</p>

<p>Kyiv does not officially confirm or deny such attacks, but says the facilities being hit are supporting Russia's war in Ukraine and are thus legitimate military targets.</p>

<p>NLMK denies cooperating with the defence ministry, saying that its Russian operations are not capable of producing military-grade heavy steels and it does not supply the military.</p>

<p>Russia's defence ministry said earlier that air defence systems had destroyed 36 drones launched by Ukraine overnight targeting several regions in Russia's southwest, including Lipetsk.</p>

<p>The ministry also said that Russian forces had taken over the villages of Spirne and Novooleksandrivka, which are in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region, the Russian news agency RIA reported, the latest in a string of such incremental territorial claims.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Britain's deputy prime minister warned Sunday that the country's upcoming general election faces threats from hostile actors such as Russia seeking to influence the UK's democratic process.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The country will go to the polls on Thursday, in an election expected to oust the governing right-wing Conservatives and put the opposition Labour party in power.&nbsp;</p>

<p>His comments came after the Australian Broadcasting Corporation reported that it had uncovered five Facebook pages spreading the same pro-Kremlin talking points.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Some of them encouraged support for the hard-right Reform UK party led by Brexiteer Nigel Farage -- a big challenger to the ruling Conservatives in Thursday's vote.</p>

<p>"There is a threat in all elections, and indeed we see it in this election from hostile state actors seeking to influence the outcome of the election campaign," Oliver Dowden told Sky News.</p>

<p>"Russia is a prime example of this, and this is a classic example from the Russian playbook," he added, noting however that the examples were "relatively typical, low-level stuff".</p>

<p>Farage -- an admirer of former US president Donald Trump -- dismissed claims that Russian bots might interfere in the election as "cobblers", using a British slang term for nonsense.</p>

<p>He has been criticised in the campaign for saying that the West provoked Russia's invasion of its neighbour Ukraine.</p>

<p>His anti-immigration party is tipped by pollsters to contribute to a landslide win by the centre left opposition Labour party by taking votes away from Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's Tories.</p>

<p>Labour has enjoyed poll leads of more than 20 points throughout the campaign, but Sunak insisted on Sunday that he will still be Prime Minister come Friday morning.</p>

<p>"I'm fighting very hard and I think people are waking up to the real danger of what a Labour government means," he told the BBC.</p>

<p>Labour, led by Keir Starmer, received another boost Sunday when the influential right-of-centre newspaper the Sunday Times endorsed his party. Music sensation Elton John also announced he was backing Labour.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Beijing Tianbing Technology Co said on Sunday that the first stage of its Tianlong-3 rocket under development had detached from its launch pad during a test due to structural failure and landed in a hilly area of the city of Gongyi in central China.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Beijing Tianbing Technology Co said on Sunday that the first stage of its Tianlong-3 rocket under development had detached from its launch pad during a test due to structural failure and landed in a hilly area of the city of Gongyi in central China.</p>

<p>There were no reports of casualties after an initial investigation, Beijing Tianbing, also known as Space Pioneer, said in a statement on its official WeChat account.</p>

<p>Parts of the rocket stage were scattered within a "safe area" but caused a local fire, according to a separate statement by the Gongyi Emergency Management Bureau.</p>

<p>The fire has since been extinguished and no one has been hurt, the bureau said.</p>

<p>The two-stage Tianlong-3 ("Sky Dragon 3") is a partly reusable rocket under development by Space Pioneer, one of a small group of rapidly growing private-sector rocket makers over the past five years.</p>

<p>Falling rocket debris in China after launches is not unheard of, but it is very rare for part of a rocket under development to make an unplanned flight out of its test site and crash.</p>

<p>According to Space Pioneer, the first stage of the Tianlong-3 ignited normally during a hot test but later detached from the test bench due to structural failure and landed in hilly areas 1.5 kms (0.9 miles) away.</p>

<p>The performance of Tianlong-3 is comparable to SpaceX's Falcon 9, according to Space Pioneer.</p>

<p>In April 2023, Space Pioneer launched a kerosene-oxygen rocket, the Tianlong-2, becoming the first private Chinese firm to send a liquid-propellant rocket into space.</p>

<p>Chinese commercial space companies have rushed into the sector since 2014 when private investment in the industry was allowed by the state.</p>

<p>Many started making satellites while others including Space Pioneer, focused on developing reusable rockets that can significantly cut mission costs.</p>

<p>The test sites of such companies can be found along China's coastal areas, located by the sea due to safety reasons.</p>

<p>But some are also sited deep in the country's interior such as Space Pioneer's test centre in Gongyi, a city of 800,000 people in the central province of Henan.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Three Hezbollah members were killed on Sunday in an Israeli airstrike in the southeast village of Houla, a media report said.</p>

<p>An Israeli drone targeted, with four air-to-surface missiles, a two-story building in Houla, killing three Hezbollah members and causing severe damage to neighbouring homes, Lebanese military sources told Xinhua.</p>

<p>The Israeli army conducted five air attacks on the villages of Taybeh, Rab El Thalathine, and Houla, and targeted eight towns and villages in the eastern and central regions with approximately 40 artillery shells, the sources added.</p>

<p>For its part, Hezbollah announced that it attacked the Israeli sites of Misqav Am, al-Motella, and Al-Alam.</p>

<p>Tensions along the Lebanon-Israel border escalated on October 8, 2023, following a barrage of rockets launched by Hezbollah toward Israel in solidarity with Hamas' attack on Israel the day before. Israel then retaliated by firing heavy artillery toward southeastern Lebanon.</p>

<p>Since the start of the confrontations on both sides of the border between Lebanon and Israel, 553 people have been killed, including 356 Hezbollah members and 100 civilians, according to Lebanese security and medical reports.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A man allegedly raped a 10-year-old boy in Pakistan's Muzaffargarh, filmed the assault, and circulated the videos on social media to blackmail the child, the Dawn newspaper reported. The police have registered a case and launched a manhunt to arrest the accused.</p>

<p>According to officials in Muzaffargarh's Bait Mir Hazar Khan police station, the accused lured the boy to a tubewell under the pretense of bathing. He then raped the boy and filmed the assault.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The videos were later used to coerce and blackmail the boy, Dawn reported.</p>

<p>In a separate incident near the Swabi-Haripur district in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the police arrested two men accused of assaulting a girl. The survivor, identified as a relative of the suspects, underwent a medical examination which confirmed the assault, Dawn reported.</p>

<p>The police said an FIR was filed against the accused based on the survivor's statement before a magistrate. The suspects, Itikhar Khan and Sirtaj Khan are currently facing legal proceedings, they said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Heavy battles and bombardment hit Gaza City's Shujaiya district for a fourth day on Sunday, months after the Israeli army declared Hamas's command structure dismantled in the northern area.</p>

<p>Tens of thousands of Palestinians have fled the devastated neighbourhood, where the army said it has fought Hamas and Islamic Jihad operatives both "above and below ground" in tunnels.</p>

<p>The military said troops had "eliminated several terrorists, located weapons and conducted targeted raids on booby-trapped combat compounds" over the past 24 hours while the air force had "struck dozens" of the operatives' infrastructure sites.</p>

<p>It also reported clashes in central Gaza and the southern Rafah area, a week after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared that the "intense phase" of the war raging since October 7 was nearing an end.</p>

<p>The United Nations humanitarian agency OCHA estimated that "60,000 to 80,000 people were displaced" from Shujaiya since new fighting broke out there on Thursday and the army issued evacuation orders.</p>

<p>Months of on-and-off talks towards a Gaza truce and hostage release deal have meanwhile made little progress, with Hamas saying Saturday there was "nothing new" in a revised plan presented by US mediators.</p>

<p>United States President Joe Biden late last month outlined what he called an Israeli plan for a six-week truce and exchange of some hostages for Palestinian prisoners held in Israel.</p>

<p>Washington last week presented "new language" for parts of the proposed deal, according to US news site Axios.</p>

<p>A Hamas official in Lebanon, Osama Hamdan, confirmed that the Islamist movement had received the latest proposal but said it presented "no real progress in the negotiations to stop the aggression".</p>

<p>Hamdan labelled the proposals "a waste of time" that aimed to give "additional time for the occupation (Israel) to practise genocide".</p>

<h3><strong>'Everything is rubble'</strong></h3>

<p>The war started with Hamas's October 7 attack on southern Israel which resulted in the deaths of 1,195 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.</p>

<p>The Hamas also seized 251 hostages, 116 of whom remain in Gaza although the army says 42 are dead.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 37,877 people, also mostly civilians, according to data from the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza.</p>

<p>Six more people were killed in an air strike at dawn targeting a family house in Rafah, said medics at Nasser Hospital where the bodies were taken.</p>

<p>Artillery shelling also struck southern areas of Rafah city, witnesses said.</p>

<p>United Nations and other relief agencies have voiced alarm over the dire humanitarian crisis and threat of starvation the war and Israeli siege have brought for Gaza's 2.4 million people.</p>

<p>"It's really unbearable," said Louise Wateridge from UNRWA, the UN agency supporting Palestinian refugees, speaking Friday after returning to the city of Khan Yunis.</p>

<p>"Everything is rubble," she said. "And yet people are living there again... There's no water there, there's no sanitation, there's no food. And now, people are living back in these buildings that are empty shells."</p>

<p>In Israel, thousands of protesters again took to the streets of Tel Aviv on Saturday night, demanding greater efforts to return the remaining captives, and calling for early elections.</p>

<p>Former hostage Noa Argamani, 26, who was rescued in a special forces raid on June 8, said in a video address that "we can't forget about the hostages who are still in Hamas captivity, and we must do everything possible to bring them back home".</p>

<h3><strong>'An obliterating war'</strong></h3>

<p>The Gaza conflict has also led to soaring tensions on Israel's northern border with Lebanon, where the army has traded cross-border fire with the Hezbollah movement since October.</p>

<p>Hezbollah is part of the "axis of resistance" of Iran-backed armed groups against Israel and its Western allies. The grouping also includes&nbsp;operatives in Iraq and Yemen's Huthi rebels.</p>

<p>Israel's military said this month that its plans for a Lebanon offensive had been "approved and validated", prompting Hezbollah to respond that no part of Israel would be spared in a full-blown conflict.</p>

<p>Iran's mission to the UN, on social media Saturday, said it "deems as psychological warfare the Zionist regime's propaganda about intending to attack Lebanon".</p>

<p>It also warned its arch foe that, "should it embark on full-scale military aggression, an obliterating war will ensue".&nbsp;</p>

<p>"All options, incl. the full involvement of all Resistance Fronts, are on the table."</p>

<p>Iran, which backs Hamas, has praised the October 7 attack as a success but has denied any involvement.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US rapper Kanye West was in Moscow, Russian media reported on Sunday quoting a well-known Russian producer.</p>

<p>Western artists have mostly not performed in Russia during its Ukraine offensive, which led to massive US and European sanctions on Moscow, as well as travel restrictions to the country.</p>

<p>Kanye West, who has stirred controversy with his political statements in the United States and was recently accused of praising Adolf Hitler, has expressed admiration for President Vladimir Putin in the past.</p>

<p>"Kanye West is already in Moscow! This is great news, he is staying in the heart of the capital," the state TASS news agency quoted producer Yana Rudkovskaya as saying on social media.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Her announcement followed rumours last month that West will perform a concert in Moscow.</p>

<p>But Luzhniki Stadium, where he was rumoured to perform, told state media it does not have information on possible concerts by the famous rapper.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ferocious storms and torrential rains that lashed France, Switzerland and Italy this weekend have left seven people dead, local authorities said on Sunday.</p>

<p>Three people in their 70s and 80s died in France's northeastern Aube region on Saturday when a tree crushed the car they were travelling in during fierce winds, the local authority told AFP.</p>

<p>A fourth passenger was in critical care, it added.</p>

<p>In neighbouring Switzerland, four people have died and another is missing, according to local police.</p>

<p>Three were killed after torrential rains triggered a landslide in the southeast, police in the Italian-speaking canton of Ticino said.</p>

<p>A man was also found dead in a hotel in Saas-Grun in the southwest canton of Valais, police said, adding that he was probably taken by surprise by a sudden rapid rise in floodwater.</p>

<p>Another man is also missing in Valais, police said.</p>

<p>The civil security services said "several hundred" people were evacuated in Valais and roads closed after the Rhone and its tributaries overflowed in different locations.</p>

<p>Emergency services were assessing the best way to evacuate 300 people who had arrived for a football tournament in Peccia, while almost 70 more were being evacuated from a holiday camp in the village of Mogno.</p>

<p>The poor weather was making rescue work particularly difficult, police had said earlier, with several valleys inaccessible and cut off from the electricity network.</p>

<p>The federal alert system also said part of the canton was without drinking water.</p>

<p>Extreme rainfall also struck southeastern Switzerland last weekend, leaving one dead and causing major damage.</p>

<p>In northern Italy's Aosta Valley, internet users shared images of spectacular floods and swollen rivers rushing down mountain slopes.</p>

<p>Scientists say climate change driven by human activity is increasing the severity, frequency and length of extreme weather events such as floods and storms.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>French voters flocked to the polls on Sunday in the first round of a snap parliamentary election that could usher in the country's first far-right government since World War Two, a potential sea change at the heart of the European Union.</p>

<p>President Emmanuel Macron stunned the country when he called the vote after his centrist alliance was crushed in European elections this month by Marine Le Pen's National Rally (RN). Her eurosceptic, anti-immigrant party was a longtime pariah but is now closer to power than it has ever been.</p>

<p>Polls opened at 0600 GMT and will close at 1600 GMT in small towns and cities, with an 1800 GMT finish in the bigger cities, when the first exit polls for the night and seat projections for the decisive second round a week later are expected.</p>

<p>Participation was high, underlining how France's rumbling political crisis has energized the electorate. By 1500 GMT, turnout was nearly 60%, compared with 39.42% two years ago - the highest comparable turnout figures since the 1986 legislative vote, Ipsos France's research director Mathieu Gallard said.</p>

<p>France's electoral system can make it hard to estimate the precise distribution of seats in the 577-seat National Assembly, and the final outcome will not be known until the end of the second round of voting on July 7.</p>

<p>"We are going to win an absolute majority," Le Pen said in a newspaper interview on Wednesday, predicting that her prot&amp;#233;g&amp;#233;, 28-year-old Jordan Bardella, would be prime minister.</p>

<p>She has sought to detoxify a party known for racism and antisemitism, a tactic that has worked amid voter anger at Macron, the high cost of living and growing concerns over immigration.</p>

<p>In H&amp;#233;nin-Beaumont, a town in Le Pen's constituency in northern France where she may be re-elected in the first round, 67-year-old Denis Ledieu said people were suffering due to the long-term deindustrializaton of the region.</p>

<p>"So if the (RN) promises them things, then why not? They want to try it out, I think," he said.</p>

<p>In Garches, a small town near Paris, a woman screamed "It's shameful, it's shameful" as Bardella arrived to cast his vote.</p>

<p>"They even invited the leftists," he said.</p>

<p>On the other side of Paris, in the town of Meaux, 51-year-old Mylène Diop said she had voted for the New Popular Front, a hastily assembled left-wing coalition polling in second. She said it was "the most important election" of her life.</p>

<p>"The RN is at the gates of power and you see the aggressiveness of people and the racist speech that has been unleashed," she said.</p>

<p>If the RN does win an absolute majority, French diplomacy could be headed for an unprecedented period of turbulence: with Macron - who has said he will continue his presidency until the end of his term in 2027 - and Bardella jostling for the right to speak for France.</p>

<p>France has had three periods of "cohabitation" - when the president and government are from opposite political camps - in its post-war history, but none with such radically divergent world views competing at the top of the state.</p>

<p>Bardella says he would challenge Macron on global issues. France could lurch from a pillar of the EU to a thorn in its side, demanding a rebate of its contribution to the EU budget, clashing with Brussels over European Commission jobs and reversing Macron's calls for greater EU unity on defence.</p>

<p>A clear RN victory would also bring uncertainty as to where France stands on the Russia-Ukraine war. Le Pen has a history of pro-Russian sentiment and while the party now says it would help Ukraine defend itself against Russian invaders, it has also set out red lines, such as refusing to provide long-range missiles.</p>

<h3><strong>'SPLIT VOTE FAVOURS RN'</strong></h3>

<p>Opinion polls have suggested the RN has a comfortable lead of 33%-36% of the popular vote, with the New Popular Front in second place on 28%-31% and Macron's centrist alliance in third on 20%-23%.</p>

<p>The New Popular Front includes a wide range of parties, from the moderate centre-left to the hard-left, eurosceptic, anti-NATO party France Unbowed, led by one of Macron's most vitriolic opponents, Jean-Luc Melenchon.</p>

<p>How the poll numbers will translate into seats in the National Assembly is hard to predict because of how the election works, said Vincent Martigny, professor of political science at the University of Nice and the Ecole Polytechnique.</p>

<p>Candidates can be elected in the first round if they win an absolute majority of votes in their constituency, but that is rare. Most constituencies will need a second round involving all candidates who received votes from at least 12.5% of registered voters in the first round. The top scorer wins.</p>

<p>"If you have a very high level of participation you might have a third or fourth party that is getting into the struggle. So then of course there's a risk of split voting and we know that the split vote favours the National Rally," Martigny said.</p>

<p>For decades, as the RN steadily gained popularity, voters and parties joined forces to block it from winning power, but that may not hold true this time.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley claimed that US President Joe Biden will be replaced by a "younger" and more "vibrant" candidate.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Speaking to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/elections/haley-warns-trump-to-prepare-for-younger-rival-renews-call-for-cognitive-tests-5c6d7294">The Wall Street Journal</a>, Ms Haley said, "They are going to be smart about it: they're going to bring somebody younger, they're going to bring somebody vibrant, they're going to bring somebody tested."</p>

<p dir="ltr">She also added that the Grand Old Party and its US Presidential candidate Donald Trump shouldn't consider Mr Biden's replacement an advantage.</p>

<p dir="ltr">“This is a time for Republicans to prepare and get ready for what's to come because there is no way there will be a surviving Democratic Party if they allow Joe Biden to continue to be the candidate,” Nikki Haley, who finished second after Donald Trump in this year's GOP nomination race, said.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Ms Haley's statement comes after Mr Biden's poor showing in the first presidential debate against Trump on June 27.</p>

<p dir="ltr">“Mark my words….Biden will not be the Democratic nominee. Republicans, get your guard up!” she posted on X.</p>

"The odds are north of 80% that the Democratic Party will remove Joe Biden from the ticket and replace him with Michelle Obama because Biden did so disastrously badly tonight that Democrats across the country are in utter freefall and complete panic," he claimed.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, former President Barack Obama extended his support to Biden. On Saturday, he wrote on X, "Bad debate nights happen. Trust me, I know.

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Minutes before going on stage for the first presidential debate on Thursday, Donald Trump received a phone call from the mother of 12-year-old Jocelyn Nungaray, who was killed in Houston this month, allegedly by two Venezuelan men in the U.S. illegally.</p>

<p>The mother, Alexis Nungaray, was returning a voicemail Trump had left earlier in the day when she was at her daughter's funeral, a friend of the family, Victoria Galvan, who witnessed the call, told Reuters. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>Nungaray's body was found in a creek near her home on June 17, after her attackers allegedly took her under a bridge, tied her up, took her pants off and strangled her, according to police and prosecutors.</p>

<p>The suspects - Johan Jose Martinez Rangel, 22, and Franklin Jose Pena Ramos, 26 - had been detained by US border authorities in Texas earlier this year but released pending a court appearance.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>During the debate, Trump spoke of Nungaray's case and the phone call as he hammered Biden on his immigration policies, accusing the Democrat of allowing murderers and rapists into the country.</p>

<p>"There have been many young women murdered by the same people he allows to come across our border," Trump said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"These killers are coming into our country and they are raping and killing women. And it's a terrible thing."</p>

<p>Citing Nungaray's case, he said: "This is horrible, what's taken place ... We're literally an uncivilized country now."</p>

<p>Trump's attacks are from a well-thumbed playbook he has used repeatedly since first running for office in 2015 to cast immigrants illegally crossing the southern border as violent criminals.</p>

<p>He typically focuses on young, usually white, women allegedly killed by Hispanic assailants to drive home that message, eschewing cases that involve male victims.</p>

<p>His opponents accuse him of cynically exploiting grieving families to fuel his narrative that foreign-born, often Hispanic, arrivals are part of an invading army.</p>

<p>"Part of what is going on here is an effort to stimulate xenophobia or animus or ethnic hostility," said Christopher Federico, a professor of political science and psychology at the University of Minnesota, adding Trump seems to be playing to racist stereotypes that paint Latino men as threats to "the perceived purity of white womanhood."</p>

<p>Studies generally find there is no evidence immigrants commit crimes at a higher rate than native-born Americans and critics say Trump's rhetoric reinforces racist tropes.</p>

<p>Still, polling shows that the visceral message resonates among many voters. It is amplified by conservative media, pro-Trump influencers online and sometimes the grieving relatives and friends of women killed.</p>

<p>Galvan, 27, blamed Nungaray's death on Biden's easing of some restrictions on the U.S.-Mexico border.</p>

<p>"I think Jocelyn would definitely still be here if President Trump was our president," Galvan said, adding that she planned to vote for the first time in a presidential election and would support Trump.</p>

<p>Despite the lack of evidence, about three-quarters of Republicans in a Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted in May said migrants in the U.S. illegally "are a danger to public safety."</p>

<p>Well-Worn Playbook</p>

<p>Trump has attacked Biden for record levels of migrants caught illegally crossing the U.S.-Mexico border. Immigration is a major voter concern, particularly among conservatives.</p>

<p>In response, Biden blames Trump for urging Republicans to block a bipartisan U.S. Senate bill earlier this year that aimed to toughen border security and has portrayed Trump's policies as unnecessarily cruel.</p>

<p>"Donald Trump is using the pain and loss of American families for the benefit of one person and one person only: Donald Trump," Biden campaign spokesperson Kevin Munoz said in a statement. "His sick and dehumanizing comments do nothing to make our border more secure and are beneath the office of president of the United States."</p>

<p>A digital ad featuring violent crimes and criticizing Biden launched last week in seven battleground states as part of a push by the conservative group Building America's Future.</p>

<p>The ad focuses on Rachel Morin - a mother of five raped and killed while jogging in August 2023 near her Maryland home - and her accused killer, an immigrant from El Salvador in the U.S. illegally.</p>

<p>"Joe Biden's open border, a nightmare for American women," a woman's voice says as the face of Morin's accused killer is displayed next to Biden's.</p>

<p>Trump's approach echoes the oft-cited "Willie Horton" ad attacking Democratic candidate Michael Dukakis in the 1988 presidential campaign, according to Susan Del Percio, a Republican strategist critical of Trump's immigration rhetoric.</p>

<p>Horton was Black and critics said the ad - which effectively boosted Republican George H.W. Bush's candidacy - sought to provoke race-based fear.</p>

<p>"Trump is saying, 'We don't like immigrants and now here's another horrific reason not to like them. They will come after you and kill you,'" she said.</p>

<p>Trump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said Biden's border policies had allowed dangerous criminals to enter the U.S. and that Trump sought to support the families of victims.</p>

<p>"President Trump says their names, calls their mothers, and stands with their families, while Joe Biden continues to ignore their suffering and welcome in millions of dangerous criminal illegal immigrants," Leavitt said in a statement.</p>

<p>Trump has used inflammatory language to describe immigrants in the U.S. illegally, including that they are "poisoning the blood" of the country.</p>

<p>Mixed Reception</p>

<p>The parents of some victims have welcomed Trump's efforts to publicize the brutal killings while others say he is simply politicizing the deaths of their loved ones.</p>

<p>In 2018, Trump publicized the case of Mollie Tibbetts after the 20-year-old University of Iowa student was killed by a Mexican immigrant in the U.S. illegally, but Tibbetts' father chastised Trump at the time for exploiting the tragedy for political gain.</p>

<p>Laura Calderwood, Tibbetts' mother, told Reuters she believed her daughter's murderer was a troubled person but that the killing had nothing to do with his immigration status.</p>

<p>"It was an anomaly," said Calderwood, a Democrat who plans to vote for Biden. "There are lots of illegal immigrants here and they don't go out and murder people."</p>

<p>Michelle Root, whose daughter Sarah was killed in Nebraska in 2016 when her car was hit by a drunken driver in the U.S. illegally, told Reuters that then President Barack Obama and Vice President Biden never responded when she wrote them at the time to raise awareness about the case.</p>

<p>Obama's personal office and the White House did not respond to requests for comment.</p>

<p>Trump, then a presidential candidate, invited her to meet with him before a rally in Omaha, she said. The meeting convinced Root - a lifelong Democrat who twice voted for Obama - to back Trump.</p>

<p>He later called her and asked her permission to mention Sarah's case in his acceptance of the Republican presidential nomination that summer, she said.</p>

<p>"If it wasn't for him, Sarah wouldn't have had a voice," she said.</p>

<p>Patty Morin, the mother of Rachel Morin, was "incredibly touched" when Trump reached out to her earlier this month to offer condolences, her attorney, Randolph Rice, told Reuters.</p>

<p>"During the 20-minute phone call, the president asked about Rachel and her family and how they are doing," Rice said in an email. "She has still not heard from the Biden administration."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On the final weekend of campaigning ahead of the UK general election on Thursday, both Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and the man who is fighting for his job at 10 Downing Street - Labour Leader Keir Starmer, have hit the temple trail to woo British Hindu voters.</p>

<p>While 44-year-old Mr Sunak was at the BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir in Neasden on Sunday to promise to keep trying to "make the community proud", 61-year-old Mr Starmer chose another north London Swaminarayan Temple in Kingsbury on Friday to reiterate his commitment to building a "strategic partnership with India".</p>

<p>The move follows a 'Hindu Manifesto' being launched by an umbrella group of British Hindu organisations for the first time ahead of a British general election, calling on elected representatives to take proactive steps to protect Hindu places of worship and tackle anti-Hindu hate.</p>

<p>"This mandir stands as a great statement of the contributions that this community makes to Britain," said Mr Sunak, in his speech at the iconic Neasden Temple, where he offered prayers and sought blessings from the elderly in the gathering.</p>

<p>"Education, hard work, family, those are my values. Those are your values. Those are Conservative values," he declared in his election pitch.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Mr Starmer was welcomed to the tunes of an India-Scottish pipe band at the Kingsbury Temple, where he also began his speech in the same way as Mr Sunak with "Jai Swaminarayan".</p>

<p>"If we're elected next week, we will strive to govern in the spirit of sewa to serve you and a world in need," said the Labour Leader, reiterating a previous message that there is "absolutely no place for Hinduphobia in Britain".</p>

<p>According to the 2021 census, around 1 million people living in Britain identify as Hindus, making this electorate quite a sizable chunk in the July 4 general election.</p>

<p>"The 'Hindu Manifesto' is a call to action for all parliamentary candidates and political parties to engage with and support the Hindu community in their constituencies," says the Hindus for Democracy group behind the initiative.</p>

<p>"It highlights the contributions of Hindus to the UK's social, cultural and economic fabric and seeks to build a future where these contributions are recognised, valued, protected and promoted for a better future for all," the group said.</p>

<p>While the incumbent Rishi Sunak-led Tories have been trailing in all pre-election surveys, how the diaspora votes line up this time with Britain's first Indian heritage Prime Minister in the race remains to be seen.</p>

<p>"For the Conservative Party, obviously, they have Rishi Sunak - a British Indian leader - for the first time. It's an unknown factor how much it will matter to British Indian voters that the leader of the party is from their background," notes Sunder Katwala, Director of the British Future think tank.</p>

<p>With just days to go before polling day on Thursday, both leaders are expected to undertake a so-called campaign blitz - zig-zagging different parts of the United Kingdom including other places of worship to clinch any remaining undecided votes.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One person was killed and five others wounded in northeastern France when several masked gunmen opened fire at a wedding ceremony, police sources said on Sunday.</p>

<p>Sources suggested that the attack in the northeastern city of Thionville was linked to a settling of scores between drug traffickers.</p>

<p>The shooting took place at a reception hall overnight Saturday to Sunday, with around a hundred people in attendance.</p>

<p>Two people were seriously injured and one of them was in a critical condition.</p>

<p>The perpetrators of the shooting have fled the scene.</p>

<p>"It was during a wedding," a police source said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"At a quarter past one in the morning, a group of people went outside to smoke in front of the hall, and then three heavily armed men arrived and opened fire in their direction."</p>

<p>The assailants arrived in a 4X4 vehicle, "probably a BMW", the source said.</p>

<p>It was not immediately clear where the vehicle had come from. Thionville is located close to the borders of Luxembourg and Germany.</p>

<p>Members of law enforcement believe that a settling of scores linked to drug trafficking was behind the violence.</p>

<p>"The wedding was not targeted as such, it was people who were at the wedding," the source said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A glass door pierced with bullet holes could be seen at the scene on Sunday morning.</p>

<p>In the neighbouring town of Villerupt shootings between rival gangs at a drug dealing point left five people injured in May 2023.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">US President Joe Biden's first presidential debate of the US Election against Republican nominee &nbsp;Donald Trump made all the wrong noises. Mr Biden's shaky performance has been a topic of discussion. While a section has been criticising Joe Biden's performance against Donald Trump, others are wondering what would happen if Mr Biden decided to step down as party flag bearer at the last minute.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Now, let's break it down for you.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">If Joe Biden withdraws his name, delegates from 50 states will have to look for a replacement at the earliest. They will most likely assemble for a nominating convention and officially appoint a candidate. The candidate is picked based on voting.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Who are the potential candidates?</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">Vice President Kamala Harris, California Governor Gavin Newsom, Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer and Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro are among the names that can represent the party.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, US Senator Ted Cruz (R-Texas) has predicted that former First Lady Michelle Obama will replace Joe Biden.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Speaking on his podcast Mr Cruz <a href="http://https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/michelle-obama-to-replace-joe-biden-us-senators-bold-prediction-5994892">said</a>, “The odds are north of 80% that the Democratic Party will remove Joe Biden from the ticket and replace him with Michelle Obama because Biden did so disastrously badly tonight that Democrats across the country are in utter freefall and complete panic.”</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Has this happened before?</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">In 1968, <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/can-joe-biden-be-replaced-as-democratic-presidential-nominee-the-best-way-is-5995140">President Lyndon Johnson</a> sent shockwaves when he decided to exit. He made the announcement in the middle of the Vietnam War.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>What is Joe Biden saying</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">President Joe Biden has<a href="http://https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/i-know-i-am-not-young-man-but-joe-biden-after-poor-debate-showing-5994162"> expressed his intent </a>to defeat&nbsp;Donald Trump in the upcoming November elections.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Speaking at a rally, he said, "I know I'm not a young man, to state the obvious. I don't walk as easy as I used to, I don't speak as smoothly as I used to, I don't debate as well as I used to. I would not be running again if I didn't believe with all my heart and soul that I could do this job. The stakes are too high." The statement came a day after President Biden faced-off with Donal Trump in a heated debate.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A speech being delivered by Nigel Farage, the leader of Britain's right-wing Reform UK party, was interrupted late Saturday when a banner of Russian President Vladimir Putin descended from the ceiling at an election rally.</p>

<p>Campaign group Led by Donkeys, which opposes Farage's views, said it was responsible for the stunt at the Columbine Centre, at Walton on the Naze in southeast England, and posted a video of the unveiling on X.</p>

<p>That showed the banner slowly unfurling behind a speaking Farage, revealing a smiling Putin giving a thumbs-up sign, along with the words "I (heart emoji) Nigel".</p>

<p>Led By Donkeys said on X: "Nigel Farage says Putin is the world leader he 'admires the most' and blames the West for Russia's illegal invasion of Ukraine."</p>

<p>That was a reference to comments Farage made earlier this month when he said the eastward expansion of the European Union and NATO had provoked Putin's invasion of Ukraine.</p>

<p>The remarks, made in an interview with the BBC, drew strong criticism across the British political spectrum ahead of a July 4 national election in which Farage's party is predicted to win millions of votes.</p>

<p>On seeing the banner, Farage said: "Who put that up there," adding: "Someone at the Columbine Centre needs to get the sack."</p>

<p>The audience then started chanting: "Rip it down."</p>

<p>Reuters has sought comment from Reform UK.</p>

<p>Farage is seeking election as a lawmaker, or member of parliament (MP), in Clacton-on-Sea, which is nine miles from Walton on the Naze.</p>

<p>On Friday, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said he was hurt and angry that a supporter of Reform UK had been recorded making a racial slur about him, saying it was too important for him not to speak out.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[France holds the first round of parliamentary elections on Sunday. Opinion polls show the far right could win the two-round legislative vote that concludes on July 7.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>France holds the first round of parliamentary elections on Sunday. Opinion polls show the far right could win the two-round legislative vote that concludes on July 7.</p>

<p>Here are some key facts about the election and what comes next.</p>

<h3><strong>HOW DOES THE VOTE WORK?</strong></h3>

<p>France has 49 million registered voters. There are 577 constituency contests, one for each seat in the National Assembly, the lower house of parliament.</p>

<p>Candidates with an absolute majority of votes in their constituency are elected in the first round. In most cases no candidate meets this criteria and a second round is held.</p>

<p>To qualify for the run-off, candidates need first-round votes amounting to at least 12.5% of registered voters.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The top scorer wins the second round.</p>

<h3><strong>WHEN WILL THE RESULTS BE ANNOUNCED?</strong></h3>

<p>Voting in the first round ends at 8 p.m. (1800 GMT) on Sunday, when pollsters publish nationwide projections based on a partial vote count. These are usually reliable. Official results start trickling in from 8 p.m. Vote counting is usually fast and efficient, and the winners of all, or nearly all, seats will be known by the end of the evening. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>WHO WILL RUN THE GOVERNMENT? &nbsp; &nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>The president names the prime minister, usually from the party with most seats.</p>

<p>For the first time in France's post-war history, the far right could win, opinion polls show, with a left-wing union seen winning the second-biggest group and President Emmanuel Macron's centrist alliance coming third.</p>

<p>But this is an election like no other in France, campaign time is short, the electoral landscape is shaken, and other scenarios cannot be excluded. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>These include a paralysed assembly divided into three groups with no one dominating it or an alliance of mainstream parties to keep the far right out of power. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>An absolute majority requires at least 289 seats.</p>

<p>Marine Le Pen's National Rally (RN) could run a minority government if it wins the most seats without reaching that threshold, but 28-year-old party leader Jordan Bardella said it wanted an absolute majority or would not be able to carry out reforms.</p>

<h3><strong>WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?</strong></h3>

<p>France has had three periods of "cohabitation," where the government is of a different political stripe from the president, in its post-war history.</p>

<p>The government has most of the power on the domestic front, but the president is the head of the military and wields influence abroad. However, the division of power on foreign policy is not clear cut and that could be an issue for France's stance on the war in Ukraine or European Union policy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Macron will have to deal with the new parliament for at least a year, after which he can call another snap election.</p>

<p>Macron won a second mandate in April 2022 and is president for three more years. Neither parliament nor the government can force him out before that. &nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

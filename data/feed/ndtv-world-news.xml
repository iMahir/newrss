       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Japan's Mount Fuji remained snow-less as of Monday -- the latest date that its majestic slopes have been bare since records began 130 years ago, the weather agency said.</p>

<p>The volcano's snowcap begins forming on October 2 on average, and last year snow was first detected there on October 5.</p>

<p>But because of warm weather, this year no snowfall has yet been observed on Japan's highest mountain, said Yutaka Katsuta, a forecaster at Kofu Local Meteorological Office.</p>

<p>That marks the latest date since comparative data became available in 1894, he said beating the previous record of October 26 -- seen twice, in 1955 and then in 2016.</p>

<p>"Temperatures were high this summer, and these high temperatures continued into September, deterring cold air" which brings snow, Katsuta told AFP.</p>

<p>He agreed that climate change may have a degree of impact on the delay in the snowcap's formation.</p>

<p>Japan's summer this year was the joint hottest on record -- equalling the level seen in 2023 -- as extreme heatwaves fuelled by climate change engulfed many parts of the globe.</p>

<p>Mount Fuji is covered in snow for most of the year, but during the July-September hiking season, more than 220,000 visitors trudge up its steep, rocky slopes.</p>

<p>Many climb through the night to see the sunrise from the 3,776-metre (12,388-foot) summit.</p>

<p>Fewer climbers tackled Mount Fuji this year however after Japanese authorities introduced an entry fee and a daily cap on numbers to fight overtourism.</p>

<p>The symmetrical mountain has been immortalised in countless artworks, including Hokusai's "Great Wave".</p>

<p>It last erupted around 300 years ago.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A UK judge on Monday jailed notorious far-right agitator Tommy Robinson for 18 months after he admitted committing contempt of court over a long-running libel case involving a Syrian refugee.</p>

<p>The sentence is the latest jail term for one of Britain's most prominent anti-Muslim activists, who is blamed for helping fuel anti-immigration riots earlier this year.</p>

<p>It came after Robinson -- whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon -- pleaded guilty earlier on Monday to 10 breaches of a 2021 High Court order.</p>

<p>It bars the 41-year-old far-right figurehead from repeating false allegations he had made about the Syrian refugee, who successfully sued him for libel.</p>

<p>Handing down the 18-month jail sentence at Woolwich Crown Court in southeast London, judge Jeremy Johnson said Robinson's actions were a "planned, deliberate, direct, flagrant breach of the court's orders".</p>

<p>"Nobody is above the law. Nobody can pick and choose which injunctions they obey and those they do not," the judge added.</p>

<p>"It is in the interests of the whole community that injunctions are obeyed."</p>

<p>Robinson, wearing a grey suit and waistcoat with no tie, was held in custody, as some of his supporters looked on in court.</p>

<p>He had turned himself in to police on Friday, after an arrest warrant was issued following his failure to appear for a July court hearing on the case.</p>

<p>Lawyers for the Solicitor General, a senior government post advising on legal matters and which pursues such cases, said during the hearing that Robinson had been "thumbing his nose at the court".</p>

<p><strong>'Undermining'</strong></p>

<p>It accused him of "undermining" the rule of law, including by last year helping to publish a film called "Silenced", which contains the libellous allegations.</p>

<p>The film remains pinned to the top of Robinson's profile on the social media site X.</p>

<p>The former football hooligan, who helped form the now-defunct far-right English Defence League in 2009, had landed himself back in court because of his "principles", his lawyers argued.</p>

<p>Robinson, who brands himself as a free speech advocate, has previously served time for contempt of court, which is not a crime but can be sanctioned with a jail term.</p>

<p>He also has several criminal convictions, including for assault.</p>

<p>On Saturday, thousands of his supporters and other protesters marched through central London demanding his release, as well as tougher immigration laws.</p>

<p>Robinson, who has reportedly spent recent months outside the UK, has amassed a large online following built around his vehemently anti-Muslim, anti-immigrant messaging.</p>

<p>Demonstrators at anti-immigrant riots which erupted across England and Northern Ireland in late July and early August could be heard chanting his name.</p>

<p>He was widely condemned for a stream of social media posts during the week of violence, which was sparked by false rumours that the suspect behind the fatal stabbings of three young girls was a Muslim asylum seeker.</p>

<p>He has been a familiar sight at far-right rallies over the years, but has seen his profile grow over the last year after his X account was reinstated following billionaire Elon Musk's purchase of the platform.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kamala Harris said Monday she would take a cognitive test in response to jabs from Donald Trump, and challenged the ex-president to take one too as mental fitness becomes a battle line in the White House race.</p>

<p>Harris has repeatedly said her 78-year-old Republican opponent, now the oldest presidential candidate in US history, is increasingly "unhinged" and unfit to lead the country again.</p>

<p>Trump has meanwhile called the 60-year-old Democratic vice president stupid, attacking her IQ in his pitch to voters in a race that the polls suggest is effectively tied.</p>

<p>Harris was asked in a CBS interview segment released Monday if she would take a cognitive test, as Trump had called for on social media.</p>

<p>"Sure. I would challenge him to take the same one," the vice president said.</p>

<p>"This is what he has resorted to. I think he is actually increasingly unstable and unhinged and has resorted to name calling because he actually has no plan for the American people," she added.</p>

<p>Harris's attacks on Trump's fitness focused last week on revelations from his longest-serving chief of staff, John Kelly.</p>

<p>The decorated Iraq veteran told The New York Times that Trump, while president, remarked that "Hitler did some good things too" and that instead of the US military's leadership, he "wanted generals like Adolf Hitler had."</p>

<p>Harris told reporters that Trump's alleged conduct was "deeply troubling and incredibly dangerous" and she later said she agreed with Kelly's description of Trump being a "fascist."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>North Korea has sent some 10,000 troops to train in Russia, the Pentagon said Monday, more than tripling the previous estimate as NATO warned of a dangerous expansion of the Ukraine war.</p>

<p>Russia and North Korea have boosted their political and military alliance in the course of the conflict, but the deployment of Pyongyang's troops into combat against Kyiv's forces would mark a significant escalation.</p>

<p>"We believe that the DPRK has sent around 10,000 soldiers in total to train in eastern Russia that will probably augment Russian forces near Ukraine over the next several weeks," Deputy Pentagon Press Secretary Sabrina Singh told journalists, using an abbreviation for North Korea's official name.</p>

<p>"A portion of those soldiers have already moved closer to Ukraine, and we are increasingly concerned that Russia intends to use these soldiers in combat or to support combat operations against Ukrainian forces in Russia's Kursk Oblast," Sabrina Singh said.</p>

<p>The number of North Korean troops in Russia could grow further "as Putin's desperation continues to rise," she said of Russia's president, whose forces have reportedly suffered hundreds of thousands of casualties in Ukraine.</p>

<p>US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby previously put the number of North Korean troops in Russia at more than 3,000 on October 23, warning that they would become "legitimate military targets" if they fight against Ukraine.</p>

<p>NATO chief Mark Rutte on Monday decried the deployment of North Korean troops to bolster Russia's war effort in Ukraine as a dangerous expansion of the conflict that signaled Putin's "growing desperation."</p>

<p>Experts have said that in return for the troops, North Korea is likely aiming to acquire military technology, ranging from surveillance satellites to submarines, plus possible security guarantees from Moscow.</p>

<p>North Korea and Russia are under UN sanctions -- Pyongyang for its nuclear weapons program, and Moscow for the Ukraine war.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Monday that Iran is seeking to develop a "stockpile" of nuclear bombs aimed at destroying Israel, two days after Israel bombed military targets in the Islamic republic.</p>

<p>On Saturday, Israel carried out air strikes on military sites in Iran in response to Tehran's October 1 attack, itself retaliation for the killing of Iran-backed militant leaders and a Revolutionary Guards commander.</p>

<p>"Iran is striving to develop a stockpile of nuclear bombs to destroy us, equipped with long-range missiles, intercontinental missiles that Iran is trying to develop," Netanyahu said.</p>

<p>"Iran could threaten the entire world at any point," Netanyahu added during a speech to lawmakers as Israel's parliament began its winter session.</p>

<p>"Stopping the Iranian nuclear programme is at the forefront of our minds, and for obvious reasons, I cannot share with you all our plans and actions in this regard."</p>

<p>The Iranian government has long denied that it is trying to build nuclear weapons and insists its programme is for peaceful purposes.</p>

<p>In recent years it has decreased its cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency, while significantly ramping up its nuclear programme, including amassing large stockpiles of enriched uranium.</p>

<p>But the head of the UN's nuclear watchdog said last week that Iran was showing "willingness" to re-engage on the nuclear issue.</p>

<p>Tehran, which supports Hamas, warned it would "respond firmly and effectively" to Israel's strikes at the weekend.</p>

<p>The war in Gaza has drawn in Tehran-backed allies of Palestinian Islamist movement Hamas, including Hezbollah in Lebanon.</p>

<p>Netanyahu said Monday that "the fanatical axis of evil led by Iran threatens to destroy our country and threatens to take over other countries".</p>

<p>It "aspires to take control of our region by force," he said, adding that Israel is the "real barrier in Iran's path".</p>

<p>"Because according to Iran, if Israel falls, many countries will fall along with it. The entire Middle East will fall into its hands."</p>

<p>The UN Security Council will meet later on Monday at Iran's request. Tehran has urged the world to condemn Saturday's strikes, which authorities said killed four soldiers and caused some damage.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[With over 5.2 million people of Indian origin residing in the US, Indian-Americans are now the second-largest immigrant group and an important political actor because of their rapid demographic growth.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With over 5.2 million people of Indian origin residing in the US, Indian-Americans are now the second-largest immigrant group and an important political actor because of their rapid demographic growth.</p>

<p>A recent survey, "2024 Indian-American Attitudes," conducted by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and YouGov, reveals a decline in Indian-Americans' attachment to the Democratic Party.</p>

<p>According to the survey, 61% of registered voters plan to vote for Kamala Harris, while 32% intend to vote for Trump.</p>

<p>Abortion and reproductive rights are a highly salient issue, ranking second in policy concerns after inflation and prices and has tied with the economy and jobs and the reason why most Indian Americans lean towards Democrats is because of the Republican party's intolerance of minorities, its perspective about abortion and ties to Christian evangelicalism.</p>

<p>While they remain solidly behind Democrats, there's an increase in support for Republican candidates and former President Donald Trump. “This modest drift toward Trump appears to be driven by Indian-American men, particularly young men born in the United States.” the report says.</p>

<p>Kamala Harris' presence on the ballot, acknowledging her Indian heritage, has increased attention on Indian-American political views. “Harris's identity in this election is worth underscoring because findings from academic research have demonstrated that, among Asian-Americans, Indian-Americans are especially inclined to mobilise behind candidates who share their ethnicity,” the survey states.</p>

<p>Indian-Americans are what are called “high propensity” voters and both parties have wooed the group because of their pivotal nature.</p>

<p>In a campaign, Harris draws attention to the fact that her mother is an immigrant from the Indian state of Tamil Nadu and as “a brilliant, 5-foot tall, brown woman with an accent.” On the other hand we also see how the Republican campaign has highlighted their Indian American community and brought Usha Vance to the limelight - the wife of Trump's vice presidential candidate JD Vance.</p>

<p>Still and all, the Democratic Party has seen a 9% decline in support among respondents, from 56% in 2020 to 47% currently. “There has been a modest shift in the community's preferences, with a greater share of respondents willing to vote for Trump since the last election,” the survey says.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Canada, once a country welcoming an inpour of immigration, on Thursday announced that it is expected to hack down on its annual permanent-resident (PR) target to 395,000 down 21% from half a million for next year, 380,000 in 2026 and 365,000 in 2027.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Canada, once a country welcoming an inpour of immigration, on Thursday announced that it is expected to hack down on its annual permanent-resident (PR) target to 395,000 down 21% from half a million for next year, 380,000 in 2026 and 365,000 in 2027.</p>

<h2>What are the implications for Indians?</h2>

<p>The number of Indians immigrating to Canada skyrocketed by 326% over the decade, increasing from 32,828 in 2013 to a staggering 139,715 in 2023, according to NFAP analysis.</p>

<p>“In the tumultuous times as we emerged from the pandemic, between addressing labor needs and maintaining population growth, we didn't get the balance quite right," Trudeau said, as the permanent residency dream for Indians seems more and more improbable now. He said, that although immigration is essential for Canada's future it has to be controlled and sustainable.</p>

<p>This change would mean stricter eligibility criteria for international students and temporary workers will be implemented to manage the influx of newcomers.</p>

<h2>Will this help the Trudeau government stay in office?</h2>

<p>Amid plummeting poll numbers, and rising popularity of the opposition, the government is seeking to regain public favour and maintain its hold on power. According to the Canadian government, the plan “will pause population growth in the short term to achieve well-managed, sustainable growth in the long term”.</p>

<p>Trudeau also said that businesses have also been a major reason for the spiralling immigration system, “Far too many corporations have chosen to abuse our temporary measures, exploiting foreign workers while refusing to hire Canadians for a fair wage.”</p>

<p>The pandemic-era policies had relaxed temporary residency to address labour gaps and the government is trying to change that.</p>

<p>“We have listened to Canadians,” Immigration Minister Marc Miller said in a statement on Thursday. He added, “This immigration policy is essential for the economic success and development of our country.”</p>

<h2>What do the Canadians want?</h2>

<p>According to a poll by Environics Institute, “The latest Focus Canada research shows that almost six in ten (58%) Canadians now believe the country accepts too many immigrants…”</p>

<p>Economists sound alarm on Canada's ballooning population, citing strains on housing and critical services like healthcare and the government has been criticised for welcoming immigrants without reinforcing housing and healthcare.</p>

<p>Canada has experienced a 2 million growth in population according to Statistics Canada, which has exacerbated the housing supply and demand imbalance. “These lower PR targets are expected to reduce the housing supply gap by about 6,70,000 units by the end of 2027,” Miller said.</p>

<h3>How do migrant advocacy groups view this issue?</h3>

<p>Syed Hussan, spokesperson for the Migrant Rights Network Secretariat, said in a statement, “Cutting permanent resident numbers is a direct assault on migrants, who will be forced to remain temporary or become undocumented, pushed further into exploitative jobs.”</p>

<p>The group is of the opinion that migrants are not the root of Canada's housing crisis, unemployment and inadequate healthcare. Instead, they are the result of "decades of federal and provincial policies that have underfunded and privatised public services".</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The once luxurious palace of Bangladesh's autocratic ex-leader Sheikh Hasina will become a museum to honour the revolution that ousted her, the leader of the caretaker government said Monday.</p>

<p>"The museum should preserve memories of her misrule and the people's anger when they removed her from power," Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus said as he toured the battered Ganabhaban palace, the former official residence of the prime minister.</p>

<p>The 84-year-old microfinance pioneer was appointed the country's "chief advisor" after the student-led uprising that forced Sheikh Hasina to flee by helicopter to India on August 5.</p>

<p>Sheikh Hasina's 15-year rule saw widespread human rights abuses, including the mass detention and extrajudicial killings of her political opponents, and a Bangladeshi court this month issued an arrest warrant for her arrest.</p>

<p>More than 700 people were killed, many in a brutal police crackdown, before Sheikh Hasina's fall.</p>

<p>As she fled, thousands rushed into her former residence, which the government said was a "symbol of repression".</p>

<p>The walls of the palace, looted and damaged in the chaos after Sheikh Hasina escaped, are daubed with graffiti condemning her fallen regime.</p>

<p>The museum will include a replica of the notorious "House of Mirrors" Aynaghar detention centre operated by Sheikh Hasina's regime -- given its name because its detainees were never supposed to see any other person besides themselves.</p>

<p>"The Aynaghar should remind visitors of the torture endured by secret prisoners," Muhammad Yunus said.</p>

<p>Sheikh Hasina's overthrow resulted in at least two days of chaos, which included the looting of a museum at the home of her father, Bangladesh's first president Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.</p>

<p>Apurba Jahangir, a press official in the office of Muhammad Yunus, said construction would start by December.</p>

<p>"The museum construction hasn't begun yet, but it will start soon," Apurba told AFP.</p>

<p>Sheikh Hasina has not been seen in public since fleeing Bangladesh.</p>

<p>The 77-year-old's last official whereabouts was a military airbase near India's capital New Delhi.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Four Indian nationals were killed and one injured when the car they were travelling in crashed and burst into flames in Canada's Ontario province, authorities said.</p>

<p>The accident occurred last week on Thursday in the Lake Shore Boulevard East and Cherry Street area of Toronto city, police said in a press release.</p>

<p>The five people, between the ages of 25-32, were travelling in a Tesla when it "lost control and struck the guard rail and then a concrete pillar" before bursting into flames, the press release said.</p>

<p>"We have gathered some evidence so far to suggest that speed was a factor," Toronto Police Duty Inspector Phillip Sinclair was quoted as saying by the Toronto Sun newspaper.</p>

<p>Four of the car occupants were pronounced dead on the scene by the police officials responding to the accident, the press release said. The fifth occupant, a 25-year-old woman, was transported to a hospital with non-life-threatening injuries.</p>

<p>She was rescued by a passing motorist who stopped to help, according to the report.</p>

<p>"Heartfelt condolences on tragic loss of Indian nationals in car accident that took place yesterday in Toronto," the official handle of the Indian Consulate in Toronto said in a post on X.</p>

<p>The post added that the consulate was in regular touch with local authorities and affected families in Canada and India. "All required assistance is being provided," it said.</p>

<p>Police have asked residents and drivers who may have dash camera footage or witnessed the event to contact investigators.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It's not just the Harris-Trump show: US voters this November 5 will cast ballots for new members of Congress, tens of thousands of state and local officials, and in multiple referendums on topics including hot-button issues like abortion.</p>

<p>Here is a look at who and what is up for a vote beyond the choice between Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Kamala Harris.</p>

<p><strong>Congress&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>In addition to choosing a president, millions of US voters will decide the fate of Congress: both in the House of Representatives -- where all seats are up for grabs -- and the Senate, where one-third are.</p>

<p>The House of Representatives has 435 members, with each representing a Congressional district and elected for a two-year term. Republicans hold the House by a small margin, but with Harris's entry into the race, Democrats are hoping to benefit from a surge in enthusiasm to recapture the lower house.</p>

<p>Thirty-four of the Senate's 100 seats are in play. The Senate consists of two senators from every state, who hold six-year terms. Democrats are in control now, but Republicans are hoping to reverse the situation.</p>

<p>If the same party were to win the presidency and both houses of Congress, it would have the power to push through the president's agenda without support from opposition lawmakers.</p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;Governors&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Gubernatorial elections will occur in 11 of the 50 US states, with key races in New Hampshire, North Carolina and Washington state.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The governor is the top executive at the state level, where most powers that do not belong to the federal government lie.</p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;Referendums&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Since the federal right to an abortion was overturned in 2022 by the Supreme Court, the issue has been ever-present on the political landscape.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Democrats have often used the debate over reproductive rights to dissuade women voters from casting ballots for Republicans.</p>

<p>Abortion rights will be the subject of referendums in 11 states, 10 of which are on whether to establish state-level abortion guarantees. Voters in Nebraska will decide whether the possibility of abortion should be limited to the first trimester.</p>

<p>In dozens of states, voters are being asked to decide on a variety of other issues.</p>

<p>In Colorado, for example, voters will vote on whether or not to ban "trophy hunting" of the mountain lion, bobcat and lynx.&nbsp;</p>

<p>And in Maine, voters will decide if they want to change their state flag.</p>

<p><strong>Local elections&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Thousands of local offices will also be up for election, including state-level lawmakers, judges, mayors, city council members, county officials, sheriffs and others.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lebanon said an Israeli strike on Tyre on Monday killed seven people, with the Israeli army later issuing an evacuation call for swathes of the southern coastal city.</p>

<p>An "Israeli enemy strike this morning on a building" in the centre of Tyre killed "seven people and wounded 17 others", a health ministry statement said, updating an earlier toll of five dead and 10 wounded.</p>

<p>An AFP video journalist saw emergency personnel rush a survivor to an ambulance on a stretcher, while other rescuers worked to put out a heavily smouldering fire at the site, where a residential apartment block had collapsed.</p>

<p>Later Monday, the Israeli army told residents in parts of central Tyre to leave immediately, warning it would attack Hezbollah targets there.</p>

<p>"Hezbollah's activities force the (Israeli army) to act against it forcefully," military spokesman Avichay Adraee said in a post on X, urging residents to "head north".</p>

<p>An accompanying map showed large swathes of the city marked in red, including an area abutting a UNESCO World Heritage site.</p>

<p>Israel last month escalated air strikes on Hezbollah strongholds and sent ground forces into Lebanon, following a year of cross-border exchanges of fire with the Iran-backed group over the Gaza war.</p>

<p>Tyre was subjected to heavy Israeli strikes last week, leaving swathes of the centre in ruins.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Reports suggest Xie may have used some of her illicit gains to fund plastic surgery in an attempt to evade arrest.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 30-year-old Chinese woman, identified by her surname Xie, has been arrested in Thailand after evading capture for nearly two years on charges of defrauding over 1.5 million yuan (approximately Rs 1.77 crore). Xie, who allegedly underwent plastic surgery to change her appearance, was wanted for orchestrating a scheme promising airline jobs to victims in exchange for large payments.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thai Immigration Police detained her following a tip-off from Bangkok residents who noticed her frequent face-covering and mask-wearing, raising suspicions of illegal immigration, the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scmp.com/news/people-culture/trending-china/article/3283169/china-woman-arrested-us210000-scam-after-undergoing-plastic-surgery-evade-capture" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>South China Morning Post </em></a>reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On October 7, police arrested Xie as she came down from her apartment to collect a food delivery. She failed to present a valid passport and was found to have overstayed her 15-day visa-on-arrival by over 650 days, having entered Thailand in late 2022.</p>

<p>Xie's criminal activities reportedly began nearly a decade ago. Between 2016 and 2019, she allegedly conned at least six people out of 1.52 million yuan by fabricating ties with major airlines and offering job placements to aspiring flight attendants. Among her victims was her cousin, whom she convinced to lend her 52,000 yuan (Rs 6.13 lakh) under the pretence of helping a friend buy a watch in Japan. Xie promised a reward for the favour, but her cousin only recovered a small part of the loan and later discovered that Xie's flight attendant persona was a fabrication.</p>

<p>Thai authorities revealed that Xie had an Interpol Blue Notice, indicating her status as an international fugitive. Chinese authorities requested this notice after tracking her fraudulent activities back to 2014, according to the South China Morning Post.</p>

<p>Reports suggest Xie may have used some of her illicit gains to fund plastic surgery in an attempt to evade arrest. The Thai Immigration Bureau Division has confirmed that Xie will be penalized under Thai law for visa violations before being deported to China. Her case has drawn parallels to that of Lao Rongzhi, a notorious Chinese fugitive who was apprehended in 2019 after eluding capture for 20 years through aliases and multiple surgeries.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cristiano Ronaldo, a legendary footballer with a global fan base, recently met a 24-year-old superfan named Gong, who cycled from China to Saudi Arabia for seven months to meet him. Starting from his home on March 18, Gong arrived at the Al Nassr Football Club on October 20, as the <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scmp.com/news/people-culture/trending-china/article/3283844/devoted-china-cristiano-ronaldo-football-fan-takes-13000km-bicycle-ride-meet-idol" rel="nofollow, noindex">South China Morning Post</a></em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scmp.com/news/people-culture/trending-china/article/3283844/devoted-china-cristiano-ronaldo-football-fan-takes-13000km-bicycle-ride-meet-idol" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em> </em></a>reported.</p>

<p>Throughout his journey, Gong cycled through several countries, including Kazakhstan, Georgia, Iran, and Qatar, before reaching Riyadh, Saudi Arabia's capital. After Ronaldo's team learned about Gong's extraordinary effort, they arranged a meeting outside the Al Nassr Football Club.</p>

<p>During their encounter, Ronaldo signed Gong's shirt and posed for several photos with him. According to the South China Morning Post, Gong faced numerous challenges. He struggled with language barriers, budget-friendly meals in different countries, and the physical exhaustion of cycling such a vast distance.</p>

<p>Gong's trip to Riyadh was inspired after Ronaldo had to cancel a planned visit to China in February due to a leg injury. Gong covered an impressive 13,000 kilometres on his bike, carrying essentials like two 60,000mAh power banks, a tent, cooking utensils, clothes, and other necessities. In places where food was costly, he relied on bread and used translation software to communicate with locals. In August, while in Armenia, he fell ill with a high fever and collapsed on the roadside, later receiving free hospital treatment.</p>

<p>Reflecting on the journey, Gong shared that the experience made him more mature and patient and helped him forge new friendships. After reaching Riyadh on October 10, he waited several days to meet Ronaldo, who was in Europe at the time. The Al Nassr FC staff assured him of a brief meeting, which finally happened after he saw Ronaldo play in an Al Nassr vs. Al Shabab match, thanks to a fan who offered him a ticket.</p>

<p>When Gong met Ronaldo, the footballer shook his hand, hugged him, and signed his No. 7 Al Nassr jersey. Ronaldo also autographed a banner with the names of Gong's friends and inscribed the phrase, "What I dream of is true love and freedom."</p>

<p>In China, Ronaldo, or "C Luo," is celebrated for his record-breaking career, boasting over 900 goals and being the most-followed individual on Instagram, with 640 million followers. Gong now plans to visit Portugal, Ronaldo's hometown, as his next adventure.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[New York is where Trump made his name as a playboy property developer, emblazoning skyscrapers with his name and searing himself into popular culture through media appearances and stunts well before he ran for office.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tourists wheeling luggage met head-on with Donald Trump supporters excited to see their idol at Madison Square Garden -- and the result was New York's sidewalks brought to a standstill.</p>

<p>The Empire State Building and the Naked Cowboy guitarist street performer -- both staples of the Manhattan cityscape -- provided a backdrop for a Trump rally held just days before the election.</p>

<p>Eric Milland, 65, from suburban Yonkers said the Republican candidate and former president deserved a warm welcome despite the city being deeply Democratic.</p>

<p>"It's great to see him in New York," said the retiree carrying a cane, who had changed the date on his camouflage Trump hat from 2020 to 2024 with orange pen.</p>

<p>"We are in big trouble, it's a crisis. Immigration is a crisis, our emergency rooms are full," he added, echoing Trump's campaign message.</p>

<p>New York is where Trump made his name as a playboy property developer, emblazoning skyscrapers with his name and searing himself into popular culture through media appearances and stunts well before he ran for office.</p>

<p>On Trump's chances of carrying true blue New York State in the presidential election, Milland said "it'd be a miracle -- but miracles have happened."</p>

<p><strong>Shouting and slurs</strong></p>

<p>The crowded streets near the venue were not without tension on Sunday.</p>

<p>A woman wearing a green North Face puffer jacket screamed abuse at Trump supporters as a film crew captured the scene.</p>

<p>Nearby, a uniformed NYPD police officer haggled with a Trump T-shirt seller, sizing up a "Trump is my savior" shirt before deciding against a purchase.</p>

<p>An anti-Trump demonstrator held up a banner reading "welcome to your Nazi rally," recalling the gathering held by an American Nazi group in 1939 at "the Garden."</p>

<p>Undeterred, a Trump supporter in a stylized black and white US flag hooded sweater posed smiling for a photo with his arm around a companion in front of the banner.</p>

<p>"I hope the terrorists kill you," one man screamed at the vendor of signature red Trump hats and T-shirts commemorating the former president's narrow escape from a sniper's bullet.</p>

<p>Police, Secret Service agents and plainclothes officers swarmed the area, a hive of activity that is home to a rail, subway and bus terminal as well as the 20,000-capacity "MSG" arena.</p>

<p>"We hope people will be happy on November 6" the day after the vote, said retired university professor Salvador, 70, from Barcelona as he and his wife weaved through Trump supporters.</p>

<p>"We wanted to come and see, for me it's interesting. Some people assume that we are against America -- but that's just the leftist politics in Europe," he said before heading to the airport to return home.</p>

<p>Some tourists stumbled into the melee, checking map apps for how to get away as their children surveyed the scene.</p>

<p>Fifty-five-year-old Democratic supporter Laura, who works in the lifestyle sector, had brought her Trump-supporting son to the rally "and then we can talk about it and discuss it later," she said.</p>

<p>"I don't think all Trump people are evil," she said. "Actually the people are a lot more normal than I thought they would be."</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kamala Harris and Donald Trump will make a final push to break their bitter deadlock as they head into the last week of the most dramatic and divisive White House race in modern times.</p>

<p>Despite a series of historic upheavals in a US election like no other, polls show the Democratic vice president and Republican former president remain neck-and-neck in the polls as Election Day on November 5 looms.</p>

<p>Both will pull out all the stops to sway voters, with Harris, 60, giving her closing pitch on Tuesday at the same spot where Trump rallied supporters to protest his election 2020 loss before the deadly January 6, 2021 assault on the US Capitol.</p>

<p>Trump, 78, is also relying on spectacle, and he gave a barnstorming rally at the famed Madison Square Garden arena in his home city of New York on Sunday night to kick off his final effort.</p>

<p>As the race goes down to the wire, the two rivals will hammer the seven battleground states where just a few thousand voters could decide who governs the world's top superpower.</p>

<p>"It's looking like a toss-up," John Mark Hansen, a professor of political science at the University of Chicago, told AFP.</p>

<p>A deeply divided United States will make history either way: by electing its first woman president, or by granting Trump a sensational comeback and putting the first convicted felon and oldest ever commander-in-chief into the Oval Office.</p>

<p><strong>'Crucial time in history'</strong></p>

<p>The choice reflects the starkly different visions offered by Harris, the first female, Black and South Asian vice president, and billionaire tycoon Trump.</p>

<p>Harris at first focused on a message of joy and positivity after her shock replacement of President Joe Biden at the top of the ticket in July, but has since switched to a relentless focus on Trump as a "fascist" who threatens democracy and women's reproductive rights.</p>

<p>The Democrat has pointedly chosen the Ellipse on the National Mall in Washington for her rally exactly a week before Election Day as it is where Trump spoke to supporters to deny his 2020 election defeat by Biden, shortly before they stormed the Capitol.</p>

<p>"This is a very crucial time in history," supporter Kimberly Whittaker said at a Harris rally in Kalamazoo in the battleground state of Michigan.</p>

<p>Trump is expected to reject the result in November if he loses again, raising the specter of chaos and violence in an already tense and deeply polarized United States.</p>

<p>The Republican has doubled down on his extreme rhetoric, with his right-wing base further fueled by Trump surviving two assassination attempts over the summer.</p>

<p>Trump has described migrants as animals, pledged to set up mass deportation camps and threatened to clamp down on domestic opposition, calling them the "enemy from within."</p>

<p>He has also ramped up his pledge to "Make America Great Again" with a focus on the economy, which like immigration remains a top concern for voters.</p>

<p>"I'm probably going to roll with Trump,” said Drew Roby, a 21-year-old health science student from Arizona, who is Black. “Honestly it was better when he was president."</p>

<p><strong>'Very competitive'</strong></p>

<p>At the heart of the race are the seven most hotly contested swing states: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Wisconsin and -- most crucially -- Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>The tightest US presidential election in decades will hinge on who can win over the few remaining undecided voters -- and who can get their base out to vote.</p>

<p>Polls also predict a historic gender gap between the candidates, as well as deep faultlines on race and age.</p>

<p>In the closing days both campaigns will be spending hundreds of millions of dollars on ads while both are also rolling out star surrogates.</p>

<p>Bruce Springsteen and Barack and Michelle Obama have turned out for Harris while on the stump for Trump is tech tycoon Elon Musk.</p>

<p>But Harris may face a bigger challenge overall.</p>

<p>Her campaign had a "better ground game" and more money but Trump "probably still benefits" from a built-in Republican advantage in the idiosyncratic US Electoral College system, said David Karol, who teaches government and politics at the University of Maryland.</p>

<p>“It's very competitive. There's no reason for anybody to be confident."</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A record number of women have been elected to Japan's house of representatives, projections showed Monday, but at less than 16 percent they remain a minority.</p>

<p>Public broadcaster NHK projected that women had won 73 of 465 lower house seats up for grabs, figures expected to be confirmed in official results later in the day.</p>

<p>In Japan's 2021 general election some 45 women were elected to the lower house.</p>

<p>The broadcaster and other outlets had previously reported that a record number of women were running in the election, accounting for around a quarter of candidates.</p>

<p>Women leaders are still rare in business and politics in Japan, which ranked 118 out of 146 in the 2024 World Economic Forum's Global Gender Gap report.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's 20-strong cabinet includes just two women.</p>

<p>In Japan, "political parties are male-oriented and not open-minded, so it's difficult to find female candidates", Momoko Nojo, head of the organisation No Youth No Japan, said last month ahead of the ruling party leadership vote.</p>

<p>"Many women also take on care work at home, which makes it difficult for them to be a politician," added Nojo, who also runs a project to encourage and support women and minorities to enter politics.</p>

<p>A cabinet office survey conducted in 2021 found that among women electoral candidates in Japan, one in four reported facing sexual harassment during their campaigns, according to Jiji Press.</p>

<p>Ishiba's ruling coalition had a disastrous showing in the election on Sunday and is projected to lose its parliamentary majority.</p>

<p>The 67-year-old premier called a vote days after taking office on October 1, but voters angry at a slush fund scandal punished his Liberal Democratic Party (LDP).</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President Joe Biden would celebrate Diwali at the White House Monday evening along with a large number of Indian Americans from across the country.</p>

<p>"Continuing a tradition from previous years, the President will light a Diya lamp in the Blue Room before his remarks," the White House said.</p>

<p>After this he would deliver remarks before a gathering of Indian Americans, for whom he is hosting a reception.</p>

<p>This would be President Biden's last Diwali reception at the White House as he is not running for the presidential election.</p>

<p>"Among the President's introductions will be a video message from Sunita "Suni" Williams, a decorated NASA astronaut and retired Navy Captain. She recorded a video greeting from the International Space Station, where she took over as Commander in September," the White House said.</p>

<p>"Suni is a practising Hindu and has previously sent Diwali greetings from the ISS to people across the globe. She has also brought multiple Indian/Hindu cultural items-including samosas and copies of Upanishads and Bhagavad Gita-with her to space in celebration of her heritage," it said.</p>

<p>"Nootana, a classical South Asian dance and music ensemble based in Washington, DC, will provide musical entertainment for guests, in addition to the Marine Corps Band," said the White House.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Republican Donald Trump led a headline-grabbing New York rally on Sunday with nonstop attacks on Kamala Harris, but Democrats sought to capitalize on crude insults from some of his allies' opening speeches.</p>

<p>Trump took to the stage at the iconic 20,000-seat Madison Square Garden arena to deliver a closing message in the exceedingly tight race for the White House that reaches its apogee on November 5.</p>

<p>"You've destroyed our country. We're not going to take it anymore, Kamala," the 78-year-old told roaring supporters wearing trademark red "Make America Great Again" hats.</p>

<p>Several speakers drew cheers with their own barbs against Harris as well as Puerto Rico and Latinos at the rally in the Democratic stronghold city.</p>

<p>Comedian Tony Hinchcliffe took aim at birthrates among Latinos and called the caribbean US territory Puerto Rico "a floating island of garbage".</p>

<p><strong>'Not a punchline'</strong></p>

<p>Harris, 60, seized on the attacks as she competes with the ex-president to win over Puerto Rican communities in the tight battleground states expected to decide the election.</p>

<p>"Puerto Ricans deserve a president who sees and invests in (their) strength," Harris said in a clip published on social media alongside Hinchcliffe's comments.</p>

<p>Pennsylvania Senator John Fetterman, a Democrat, noted the state is home to almost half a million Puerto Ricans and nearly three quarters are able to vote.</p>

<p>Ricky Martin, the Puerto Rican superstar with 18.6 million followers on Instagram, quickly shared a video of Harris's appeal to Puerto Rican voters, along with a clip of Hinchcliffe's remarks.</p>

<p>"This is what they think of us," Martin wrote in Spanish. "Vote for @kamalaharris."</p>

<p>Puerto Rican singer Bad Bunny also showed support for the vice president by sharing one of her videos to his 45.6 million followers on Instagram.</p>

<p>Trump's rally at "The World's Most Famous Arena" included a surprise appearance by his wife Melania and backers such as billionaire Elon Musk, who has personally hit the campaign trail for the ex-president.</p>

<p>However, the venue also hosted a far-right, pro-Hitler rally in 1939, complete with eagles, Nazi insignia and salutes -- an association that has generated darker headlines.</p>

<p>Professional wrestling legend Hulk Hogan, who also spoke at the Republican convention in July, rejected criticisms of the rally: "I don't see any Nazis in here."</p>

<p><strong>Harris 'boots on ground'</strong></p>

<p>Other speeches also drew concern and criticism, including from Stephen Miller, one of Trump's most hard-right advisors.</p>

<p>"America is for Americans and Americans only," he shouted into the microphone, after pledging a crackdown on cartels and "criminal migrants".</p>

<p>While former Fox News host Tucker Carlson took a mocking shot at Harris's background, calling her "a Samoan Malaysian low I.Q. former California prosecutor".</p>

<p>Harris, meanwhile, charged through a packed day of campaigning in must-win Pennsylvania's largest city, including stops at a Black church, a barbershop and a Puerto Rican restaurant.</p>

<p>With barely a week to go, she was leaving nothing to chance in Philadelphia, where she must run up her vote tally to win the battleground state.</p>

<p>"We must not wake up the day after the election and have any regrets," she told a rally in Philadelphia.</p>

<p>Sunday's visit was the vice president's 14th trip to Pennsylvania since she jumped to the top of the ticket after President Joe Biden's shock withdrawal in July.</p>

<p>"This is the closest and the best opportunity we have to have a female in office who happes to be a Black female," Myrda Scott, from Philadelphia, told AFP at one of Harris's rallies in the city.</p>

<p>Harris rolled up to Philly Cuts barber shop in the largely Black neighborhood of West Philadelphia to meet residents, before ducking into the African-American-themed Hakim's Bookstore &amp; Gift Shop.</p>

<p>"She's boots to the ground," 43-year-old African-American woman Myrda Scott, who runs a financial firm, told AFP as she awaited Harris at a youth basketball rec center rally.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, Harris will hold a major rally in Washington near the White House in the park where Trump fired up his supporters before they stormed the US Capitol to try to overturn the 2020 election result.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's ruling coalition fell short of his declared "victory line" of a majority in snap parliamentary elections, media projections showed Monday.</p>

<p>AFP examines the options now for the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) after its worst result since 2009, and the prospects for its bruised leader Ishiba, who only took office on October 1.</p>

<p><strong>Why the big loss?</strong></p>

<p>Fiercely critical of former prime minister Shinzo Abe and his brand of establishment politics, Ishiba has long played on his relative popularity with voters as the LDP's "intraparty foe".</p>

<p>But while this won him the party leadership, in the election citizens were more interested in punishing the LDP over a scandal that saw party members pocket money from fund-raisers.</p>

<p>That the main opposition Constitutional Democratic Party (CDP) recently elected moderately conservative former prime minister Yoshihiko Noda as leader also didn't help.</p>

<p>"I think the majority of Japanese people trust Noda", said Masato Kamikubo, a politics professor at Ritsumeikan University.</p>

<p>"He is a very stable politician", Kamikubo said.</p>

<p>While the LDP's seats as projected by public broadcaster NHK tumbled to 191, from 259 seats at the last election, the CDP's tally soared to 148 from 96.</p>

<p>Komeito, the LDP's coalition partner, slipped to 24 from 32, with new party chief Keiichi Ishii losing his seat.</p>

<p><strong>Could the opposition form a government?</strong></p>

<p>This is tricky given the fragmented opposition, and memories of its tumultuous rule between 2009 and 2012, analysts say.</p>

<p>"The possibility of a handover of power to the opposition isn't zero, but there are far too many opposition parties for any of them to reach a majority," said Yu Uchiyama, a political science professor at the University of Tokyo.</p>

<p>Policy differences and past fallings-out continue to divide and hobble opposition parties, from communists to the liberal CDP, the centrist Democratic Party for the People (DPP) and the "reformist conservative" Japan Innovation Party.</p>

<p><strong>Can Ishiba find new partners?</strong></p>

<p>The prime minister has his work cut out to make it happen.</p>

<p>On the campaign trail, CDP leader Noda said it would be "impossible" to join forces with the LDP, having been part of previous no-confidence votes.</p>

<p>The Japan Innovation Party also remains unconvinced, with its head Nobuyuki Baba dismissing a tie-up with the LDP in its current scandal-tainted state as "impossible".</p>

<p>The centrist DPP, too, denied it would sign up for the coalition.</p>

<p>But its leader, Yuichiro Tamaki, left open the possibility of a "partial coalition" where it can offer some flexibility on individual policies it has an affinity with.</p>

<p><strong>What about Ishiba's future?</strong></p>

<p>Ishiba will likely therefore have to resort to heading a minority administration, seeking support from other parties on a case-by-case basis.</p>

<p>But this is likely to destabilise Ishiba's nascent power base, and leave him susceptible to challenges from within his own party.</p>

<p>Speculation is growing that Ishiba may be forced to resign to take responsibility for the debacle -- becoming the shortest-serving prime minister in Japan's post-war history.</p>

<p>In a nuanced denial of this prospect, though, Ishiba on Sunday night answered in the affirmative when asked by a reporter whether the prime minister intends to follow through on his duties.</p>

<p>"If the ruling coalition or even just the LDP loses its majority, Ishiba will face harsh criticism from party members", Yosuke Sunahara of Kobe University told AFP before Sunday.</p>

<p>But at the same time, the ruling coalition's loss of a majority in the Lower House only goes to lay bare public disenchantment with the political funding scandal.</p>

<p>So if "Ishiba is ousted while the party tries to gloss over the issue, public backlash against the LDP will intensify," Sunahara said.</p>

<p>"This makes it difficult for Ishiba's rivals within the party to criticise him."</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

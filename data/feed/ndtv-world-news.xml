       <description><![CDATA[Iran said it expects Lebanon's Tehran-backed Hezbollah group to hit deeper inside Israel and no longer be confined to military targets after Israel killed the Hezbollah commander. Hezbollah has been exchanging near-daily fire with Israeli forces.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<ol>
	<li>A strike claimed by Israel in an overcrowded residential area of South Beirut has changed the calculus, Iran's mission to the United Nations said. "We expect... Hezbollah to choose more targets and (strike) deeper in its response," said the mission quoted by the official IRNA news agency. "Secondly, that it will not limit its response to military targets."&nbsp;</li>
	<li>The strike on Tuesday killed Hezbollah commander Fuad Shukr. According to Lebanon's health ministry, five civilians -- three women and two children -- also died.</li>
	<li>Israel said Shukr was responsible for rocket fire that killed 12 youth in the annexed Golan Heights, and had directed Hezbollah's attacks on Israel since the Gaza war began.</li>
	<li>"Hezbollah and the (Israeli) regime had observed certain lines", including limiting strikes to border areas and military targets, Iran's mission said. The Beirut strike crossed that line, it added.</li>
	<li>Hours after Shukr's killing, the political leader of Hamas, Ismail Haniyeh, was killed in a pre-dawn "hit" on his accommodation in Tehran, Iran's Revolutionary Guards said. Israel has declined to comment.</li>
	<li>The US will bolster its military presence in the Middle East, deploying additional warships and fighter jets to the region to "mitigate the possibility of regional escalation by Iran" or its proxies, the Pentagon said.</li>
	<li>Indian nationals in Israel have been asked to stay vigilant and adhere to the safety protocols following the escalating tension in the region. The advisory for Indian citizens in Israel comes a day after the Indian Embassy in Beirut strongly advised them against travelling to Lebanon till further notice. It also asked them to leave Lebanon.</li>
	<li>The leader of Yemen's Iran-backed Huthi rebels also vowed a "military response" to the killing of Ismail. "There has to be a military response to these crimes, which are shameless and dangerous, and constitute a major escalation by the Israeli enemy," Abdul Malik al-Huthi said in a televised speech.</li>
	<li>The Yemeni rebels have been launching drones and missiles at shipping in the Red Sea since November, saying they are acting in solidarity with Palestinians during the Gaza war.</li>
	<li>Fighting between Israel and Hezbollah since October last year has killed at least 542 people on the Lebanese side, most of them fighters but also including 114 civilians, according to a tally by news agency AFP.</li>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Flights to Beirut by Air France and low-cost carrier Transavia France will remain suspended until at least Tuesday due to "security" concerns in the region, parent company Air France-KLM said.</p>

<p>The two French airlines first stopped servicing the route on Monday, a day after Israel vowed to retaliate following rocket fire from Lebanon that killed 12 people in the Israeli-annexed Golan Heights.</p>

<p>"Any resumption of operation will be subject to a renewed evaluation on the ground," a spokesman said Saturday, adding that passengers with reservations could rebook at no extra cost.</p>

<p>Flights to Tel Aviv will continue as normal, he added.</p>

<p>The rocket attack on the Golan Heights sparked fears that fighting between Hezbollah and Israel would escalate.</p>

<p>When those fears subsided somewhat the airlines announced on Tuesday that flights would resume on Wednesday.</p>

<p>But Israel then struck a Hezbollah stronghold in south Beirut on Tuesday evening, targeting a senior commander it blamed for the rocket strike on the Golan Heights.</p>

<p>This development sparked an extension of the flight suspension until Saturday, which has now been prolonged again.</p>

<p>Iran said on earlier Saturday it expects the Tehran-backed Hezbollah group to hit deeper inside Israel and no longer be confined to military targets.</p>

<p>Hezbollah has been exchanging near-daily fire with Israeli forces.</p>

<p>German carrier Lufthansa has suspended flights until August 5.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iran said on Saturday it expects Lebanon's Tehran-backed Hezbollah group to hit deeper inside Israel and no longer be confined to military targets after Israel killed the Hezbollah military commander.</p>

<p>Hezbollah has been exchanging near-daily fire with Israeli forces, saying it is targeting military positions over the border, since its Palestinian ally Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, sparking war in Gaza.</p>

<p>But a strike claimed by Israel in an overcrowded residential area of South Beirut changed the calculus, Iran's mission to the United Nations said.</p>

<p>Iran and Hamas have also vowed to retaliate.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Palestinian militant group Hamas is preparing to choose a political leader after the killing of Ismail Haniyeh in a Wednesday attack in Tehran blamed on Israel.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Palestinian militant group Hamas is preparing to choose a political leader after the killing of Ismail Haniyeh in a Wednesday attack in Tehran blamed on Israel.</p>

<p>Speculation is swirling over the crucial succession almost 10 months into the Gaza war which erupted following Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel.</p>

<p>Qatar-based Haniyeh, elected Hamas's political chief in 2017, died in a pre-dawn strike on his accommodation while he was visiting the Iranian capital for the swearing-in ceremony of President Masoud Pezeshkian.</p>

<p>The context of this succession -- a violent death amid a months-long war in Gaza -- may influence the future of Hamas more than the individual personality of its leader.</p>

<p>Despite the emergence of pragmatists moving toward indirect recognition of Israel's right to exist, Hamas members remain committed to an uncompromising approach to the struggle for a Palestinian state, including through armed means.</p>

<p>A source from the group told AFP that "relations with Arab and Islamic countries" will also be taken into account in picking its next leader.</p>

<p>Here are some of the senior officials tipped as Hamas's next potential political leader:</p>

<h3><strong>Khalil al-Hayya</strong></h3>

<p>Khalil al-Hayya is the deputy head of Hamas's political bureau in the Gaza Strip, and said to be well acquainted with the group's leader in the territory Yahya Sinwar.</p>

<p>In 2006 Hayya headed Hamas's parliamentary bloc, which had just won elections. The subsequent months of political and administrative discord marked the beginning of the schism between the Islamist movement and Fatah, the party of Palestinian Authority President Mahmud Abbas.</p>

<p>Hayya, who has repeatedly stressed the importance of armed struggle, lost several family members in Israeli military operations including one that targeted his house in the northern Gaza Strip in 2007.</p>

<h3><strong>Musa Abu Marzuk</strong></h3>

<p>The senior member of Hamas's political bureau is considered similar to Haniyeh in his pragmatic approach to negotiations.</p>

<p>For instance, Marzuk has spoken out in favour of a "long-term ceasefire" with Israel, and favours accepting the Palestinian borders drawn after the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, which remains contentious for some within Hamas.</p>

<p>In the 1990s he lived in the United States, where he was arrested on charges of raising funds for the movement's armed wing. He then lived in exile, including in Jordan, Egypt and Qatar.</p>

<p>He has previously been mentioned as a possible successor to Hamas leaders, without success so far.</p>

<h3><strong>Zaher Jabarin</strong></h3>

<p>Hamas's long-time treasurer was close to Haniyeh, and has sometimes been described as one of his right-hand men.</p>

<p>After being detained in Israeli prisons, he was released in 2011 as part of an exchange for the release of Gilad Shalit, an Israeli soldier held hostage for five years.</p>

<p>Jabarin, who has strong ties with Turkey, where he once lived, has recruited people for large-scale money-laundering activities, two of whom were arrested in Israel in 2018.</p>

<p>He has also taken part in deadly operations carried out by Hamas's armed wing.</p>

<h3><strong>Khaled Meshaal</strong></h3>

<p>Haniyeh's predecessor has lived in exile since 1967, in Jordan, Qatar, Syria and other countries.</p>

<p>He was propelled to the head of the movement after Israel killed Hamas's founder, Ahmed Yassin, and then his successor Abdelaziz al-Rantisi.</p>

<p>In 1997 Meshaal survived a poisoning assassination attempt in Amman by agents of Mossad, the Israeli intelligence service.</p>

<p>While living in Syria, he criticised the Damascus regime for its violent repression of anti-government protests, a crackdown which had caused friction with Iran, Syria's strategic ally and a major supporter of Hamas.</p>

<h3><strong>Yahya Sinwar</strong></h3>

<p>Sinwar, elected in February 2017 to lead Hamas in the Gaza Strip, is a hardliner and an alleged mastermind of the October 7 attack.</p>

<p>The ascetic 61-year-old spent 23 years in Israeli prisons before being released in 2011 as part of a prisoner exchange.</p>

<p>Born in Khan Yunis in the Gaza Strip, he joined Hamas when it was founded in 1987, the year of the first intifada or uprising.</p>

<p>He would go on to establish Majd, the group's internal security service.</p>

<p>The former elite commander in the Al-Qassam Brigades, Hamas's armed wing, is wanted by Israel and appears on the United States' list of sanctioned international terrorists.</p>

<p>Sinwar, who shrouds his movements in the highest secrecy, has not appeared in public since October 7.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An Al-Shabaab suicide bomber and gunmen attacked a busy beach in the Somali capital Mogadishu, killing 32 people and wounding scores more, in one of the deadliest attacks in months, police said on Saturday.</p>

<p>The Al-Qaeda-linked jihadists have been waging an insurgency against the internationally backed federal government for more than 17 years and have previously targeted the Lido beach area, popular with business people and officials.</p>

<p>Unverified videos shared online in the immediate aftermath of the attack showed people scattering along a street, with a number of clips purporting to show bloodied bodies lying on the beachfront.</p>

<p>"More than 32 civilians died in this attack and about 63 others were wounded, some of them critically," police spokesman Abdifatah Adan Hassan told reporters during a press conference.</p>

<p>"Targeting and blasting to kill 32 members from the civilian population means these Kharijites are not going to target only government centres, soldiers and officials," he said, using the term Somali officials adopt to describe Al-Shabaab.</p>

<p>The assault, for which Al-Shabaab claimed responsibility in a post on a pro-Shabaab website, began late on Friday when a suicide bomber detonated a device and gunmen stormed the area, police and witnesses told AFP.</p>

<p>Officer Mohamed Omar told AFP they had "shot civilians randomly".</p>

<p>He said security forces had ended the attack and killed five gunmen, while a sixth member of the group "blew himself (up) at the beach".</p>

<p>Witnesses said there were many people at the popular location when the explosion occurred, describing how gunmen then stormed the area.</p>

<p>- Lido Beach attacks -</p>

<p>"Everybody was panicked and it was hard to know what was happening because shooting started soon after the blast," witness Abdilatif Ali told AFP.</p>

<p>He said that people attempted take cover on the ground or flee.</p>

<p>"I saw many people strewn (on the ground) and some of them were dead and others wounded," he said.</p>

<p>Ahmed Yare witnessed the attack unfold from a nearby hotel.</p>

<p>"I saw wounded people at the beachside. People were screaming in panic and it was hard to notice who was dead and who was still alive," he told AFP.</p>

<p>Al-Shabaab has claimed responsibility for numerous bombings and attacks in Mogadishu and other parts of the country, whose government is pressing on with an offensive against the Islamist militants.</p>

<p>The Lido area has been the target of previous attacks, including a six-hour Al-Shabaab siege of a beachside hotel in 2023, which left six civilians dead and 10 wounded.</p>

<p>Five people were killed in a powerful car bomb blast at a cafe in the capital last month.</p>

<p>In March, the militants killed three people and wounded 27 in an hours-long siege of another Mogadishu hotel, breaking a relative lull in the fighting.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In response to the killing of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in its capital Tehran, Iran has arrested over two dozen individuals, including high-ranking intelligence officers, military officials, and staff at a military-run guesthouse in the capital, New York Times <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/03/world/middleeast/iran-security-response-hamas-assassination.html?smid=nytcore-android-share">reported</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Israel's elite intelligence agency Mossad enlisted Iranian security agents to plant explosives at the guesthouse where Haniyeh was staying. Haniyeh, who headed Hamas's political office in Qatar, was in Tehran for the inauguration of Iran's new president. The assassination, occurring just hours after the president's swearing-in ceremony, is seen as a massive intelligence and security failure for Iran.</p>

<p>"The perception that Iran can neither protect its homeland nor its key allies could be fatal for the Iranian regime because it basically signals to its foes that if they can't topple the Islamic Republic, they can decapitate it," said Ali Vaez, Iran director for the International Crisis Group, told New York Times.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>READ</strong> | <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/israel-hired-iranian-agents-to-assassinate-hamas-chief-in-tehran-report-6252736">2 Iran Agents, Bombs In 3 Rooms: Inside Mossad's Kill Op For Hamas Chief</a></p>

<p>Iranian security forces conducted thorough searches of the guesthouse compound. They detained staff, confiscated electronic devices, and scrutinised surveillance footage and guest lists. Senior military and intelligence officials responsible for Tehran's security were also interrogated, with several placed under arrest pending further investigation.</p>

<p>The compound, managed by the IRGC, housed Haniyeh in a room he frequently used during his Tehran visits.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps or IRGC's specialised intelligence unit for espionage has taken the lead in the investigation. The unit is actively pursuing suspects to uncover the network responsible for the assassination.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Iranian and Hamas officials have accused Israel of orchestrating the assassination, a stance supported by several US. officials. Israel, maintaining its stance on eliminating Hamas's military capabilities, has not acknowledged responsibility for the attack.</p>

<p>According to The Telegraph, Israel's initial plan was to assassinate Haniyeh in May during his visit to Tehran for the funeral of former Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi. The operation was aborted due to overwhelming crowds, which posed a major risk of failure, according to two Iranian officials who spoke to The Telegraph. Two agents, working under Mossad's direction, placed explosive devices in three separate rooms of the IRGC guesthouse in northern Tehran.</p>

<p>This assassination has been confirmed by officials within the IRGC, who now believe Mossad employed agents from the Ansar-al-Mahdi protection unit, a group responsible for safeguarding high-ranking officials inside and outside the country.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;Israel has previously targeted Iranian nuclear scientists and military commanders, including the high-profile killing of Mohsen Fakhrizadeh in 2020. These operations have often involved sophisticated technology and precise execution.</p>

<p>Days before Haniyeh's assassination, Iran's Minister of Intelligence, Seyed Esmaeil Khatib, claimed success in dismantling a Mossad infiltrator network. However, Haniyeh's killing contradicted these assurances of any security failure.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Frustrated by the influx of customers, McGregor set a piece of cardboard alight and flung it into a dumpster full of flammables outside the restaurant.</p>

<p>According to a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdga/pr/chatham-county-man-sentenced-federal-prison-lighting-dumpster-fire-temporarily-closed">release by the US attorney office</a>, the fire became so intense that customers in the drive-through lane had to back out of the parking lot, and the restaurant was forced to briefly close while the Savannah Fire Department extinguished the blaze. McGregor, who filmed the fire with his cell phone, was identified on surveillance video as starting the fire. He was arrested by Savannah Police Department investigators, and in May pled guilty to arson in US District Court.</p>

<p>"Intentionally setting a fire in an effort to shut down or damage someone else's property is inexcusable," <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdga/pr/chatham-county-man-sentenced-federal-prison-lighting-dumpster-fire-temporarily-closed">said US Attorney Steinberg</a>. "Joshua McGregor will have substantial time to ponder his post-prison employment options."</p>

<p>"Arson is an extremely violent crime that not only destroys property but also places firefighters, first responders and the general public at great risk," said Beau Kolodka, Assistant Special Agent in Charge for the ATF Atlanta Field Division. "The ATF, along with the Savannah Fire's Arson Unit and our other law enforcement partners, are committed to ensuring that our communities are safe and that those who commit these dangerous acts are held accountable."</p>

<p>"Savannah Fire's Arson Unit greatly appreciates our continued ability to work with our local and federal partners to successfully prosecute arson that effects interstate commerce in our jurisdiction," said Fred Anderson, chief investigator for the Savannah Fire Arson Unit. "These efforts made as a partnership have continued to help make our community safer and greatly reduce the act of arson throughout the city."&nbsp;</p>

<p>The case was investigated by the Savannah Fire Department, the Savannah Police Department, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, and prosecuted for the United States by Southern District of Georgia Special Assistant U.S. Attorney Makeia R Jonese.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Turkish shooter Yusuf Dikec, who won a silver medal at the Paris Olympics 2024 in the 10m air pistol competition, became a viral sensation for his “gearless” look. His casual demeanour and the decision to not wear protective earplugs or special lenses made him a social media trend. Yusuf Dikec wore regular spectacles and a team T-shirt, his left hand nonchalantly resting in his pants pocket.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">Several rumours circulated after he won the medal, one of which said that the 51-year-old took up shooting following a tumultuous divorce. Some social media users also claimed that Dikec was a mechanic who turned to shooting following a challenging divorce.</p>

<p dir="ltr">A Facebook page published a post claiming to explain his background, describing him as a mechanic who took up shooting following a rocky divorce. The post also claimed that Dikec took a jibe at his former spouse while receiving his silver medal.</p>

<p dir="ltr">However, the narrative was a complete satire.</p>

<p dir="ltr">According to a&nbsp;<a href="https://people.com/no-viral-turkish-shooter-yusuf-dikec-did-not-ask-ex-wife-return-dog-2024-paris-olympics-8687912">People</a> report, Dikec started shooting competitively in 2001, following his employment with the Gendarmerie General Command as a non-commissioned officer.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">He's a four-time Olympian, having competed in 2008, 2012, 2016 and 2020.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Dikec went into detail about his distinctive shooting method in an interview with the Turkish broadcaster TGRT Haber. He described his shooting method as one of the "rare shooting techniques in the world."&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">He claims that even the referees are taken aback by his practice of shooting with both eyes open.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Dikec went on to say that given their intense training, a medal was expected. "This year we prepared a lot and worked a lot... this success belongs to all of Turkey."&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">He is not done yet. He informed reporters that he and his teammate Sevval Ilayda Tarhan are looking forward to competing in the Los Angeles Summer Games in 2028.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said late Friday he had agreed with Fox News to debate Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris on September 4.</p>

<p>"I have agreed with FoxNews to debate Kamala Harris on Wednesday, September 4th," Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform, but it was not immediately clear if Harris had agreed to the debate.</p>

<p>Trump's post came hours after Harris secured the Democratic party's presidential nomination as party standard bearer in November's election.</p>

<p>Trump's White House bid was turned upside down on July 21 when President Biden, 81, facing growing concerns about his age and lagging polling numbers, withdrew his candidacy and backed Harris.</p>

<p>Biden bowed out following a disastrous debate performance against Trump in June on CNN.</p>

<p>A second Trump-Biden televised debate had been scheduled for September 10 on ABC television.</p>

<p>That was expected to remain in place, with Harris replacing Biden, but Trump's spokesman Steven Cheung last week said it was "inappropriate" to schedule it before Harris was formally the Democratic nominee.</p>

<p>In his post Trump gave details of the debate venue and the moderators, saying it it would be held before a full audience.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With the US Presidential election in its last stretch, Donald Trump and Kamala Harris are leaving no stone turned to win voters. While Harris has been trying to play on her prosecutor past and how she will indict the ex president for crimes he's being tried for, Trump has questioned the Vice-President's racial identity.</p>

<p>Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, has launched a racially insensitive attack on Kamala Harris by questioning whether she is "Indian or Black".</p>

<p>“I've known her a long time, indirectly, not directly very much, and she was always of Indian heritage, and she was only promoting Indian heritage," Trump said at the National Association of Black Journalists convention in Chicago.</p>

<p>"I didn't know she was Black until a number of years ago, when she happened to turn Black, and now she wants to be known as Black," he added.</p>

<p>Despite the remarks snowballing into a massive controversy, the 78-year-old doubled down and shared a picture on social media which shows Kamala Harris' "Indian heritage".</p>

<p>"Thank you Kamala for the nice picture you sent from many years ago! Your warmth, friendship, and love of your Indian Heritage are very much appreciated," Trump said while sharing the photo on Truth Social.</p>

<p><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" class="truthsocial-embed" src="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/112887108527191005/embed" style="max-width: 100%; border: 0" width="600"></iframe><script src="https://truthsocial.com/embed.js" async="async"></script></p>

<p>Trump has a history of attacking his opponents based on race. He falsely accused Barack Obama, the country's first black president, of not being born in the US.</p>

<p>Trump attacked the former UN ambassador and his Republican primary opponent Nikki Haley by falsely claiming she could not be president because her parents were not US citizens when she was born.</p>

<p>And now, Kamala Harris.</p>

<p>Kamala Harris' mother, Shyamala Gopalan, was Indian and her father, Donald Jasper Harris, is Jamaican; both immigrated to the US.</p>

<p>She is seeking to become the first Black woman and Asian-American president in US history and her entry into the 2024 contest has seen a surge of enthusiasm for her candidacy among Black voters and young people — groups with which Trump has sought to broaden his appeal.</p>

<p>Trump's controversial remarks come as the race for the November 5 presidential election gained momentum with opinion polls showing that Vice President Harris, abruptly thrust into the role of presidential candidate fewer than 10 days ago, has narrowed the gap with her Republican rival.</p>

<p>Harris condemned Trump's comments later Wednesday as “the same old show” of "divisiveness" and "disrespect".</p>

<p>"Let me just say: The American people deserve better. The American people deserve better than that," Harris said during a speech to a historically Black sorority convention in Houston.</p>

<p>A July Bloomberg News/Morning Consult poll released Tuesday showed Harris erased the lead Trump enjoyed in seven states likely to determine the election, leading the former president 48% to 47% — a statistical tie. The survey also showed that across those states, Harris enjoyed the support of 75% of Black voters, compared to 19% for Trump.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Their parents were posing as an Argentine couple in Slovenia and were later convicted of spying. The two children accompanied them to Moscow on Thursday from Turkey]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Much like the script of a film, young Sofia and Daniel had no clue about their parents being undercover Russian spies pretending to be Argentine expats in Slovenia. The children were able to discover their nationality only when they were flown to Moscow, the Kremlin said. The parents -- Artem Dultsev and Anna Dultseva -- were among the 24 prisoners who were released as part of the landmark prisoner swap deal.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Artem Dultsev and Anna Dultseva were posing as an Argentine couple in Slovenia and were later convicted of spying. Their two children -- Sofia, 11, and Daniel, 8 -- accompanied them to Moscow on Thursday from Turkey, <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/08/02/europe/russian-spies-children-prisoner-swap-intl/index.html">CNN</a> reported.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the children “found out that they were Russian only when the plane took off from Ankara”.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Interestingly, as soon as they landed in Moscow they were greeted by Russian President Vladimir Putin on the tarmac in Spanish since they did not speak Russian. They also were unaware of who Putin was, Peskov noted.</p>

<p dir="ltr">“When the children came down the plane's steps – they don't speak Russian – and Putin greeted them in Spanish, he said ‘Buenas noches',” Peskov said.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">He added that later on the children asked their parents who had greeted them as they didn't even know who Putin was.</p>

<p dir="ltr">As the family came down from the aircraft's stairs, Anna, while holding her tears, hugged the Russian President, who stood on the red carpet rolled on the tarmac holding bouquets of flowers.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">Putin greeted her with a kiss on the cheek and shoulder, and even gave her and her daughter bouquets.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Further, he greeted the rest of the released Russians and later on they walked together on the red carpet away from the plane.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The historic swap came as a result of years of behind-the-scenes negotiations that involved the US, Russia, Belarus and Germany. This ultimately led Berlin to agree to Moscow's key demand – release convicted Russian assassin Vadim Krasikov.</p>

<p dir="ltr">As per reports, a total of eight people, including Krasikov, have been sent back to Russia in exchange for 16 people, who were in detention in Russia, including former US Marine Paul Whelan, Evan Gershkovich, a Wall Street Journal reporter, and two other Americans.</p>

<p dir="ltr">On Wednesday, both Dultsev and Dultseva had pleaded guilty to espionage at a Ljubljana court. They were sentenced to serve time in prison.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Dultsev, who lived undercover in Slovenia, was posing as an IT businessman named Ludvig Gisch. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to over a year and a half in prison.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">Dultseva, on the other hand, was posing as an art dealer and gallery owner named Maria Rosa Mayer Munos. Both of them were set to be deported.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tensions have escalated in the Middle East after Iran and the groups it supports vowed revenge for the killing of top Hamas and Hezbollah leaders.</p>

<p>Israel killed Hezbollah commander Fuad Shukr in Beirut on Tuesday, a move it said was a response to deadly rocket fire last week on the annexed Golan Heights.</p>

<p>Hours later, Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh was killed in the Iranian capital, while Hezbollah commander Fouad Shukur died in a strike in Lebanon in quick succession last month.</p>

<p>The killings of Hamas and Hezbollah leaders are the latest of several major incidents that have inflamed regional tensions during the Gaza war which has drawn in Iran-backed groups in Syria, Lebanon, Iraq and Yemen.</p>

<p>This escalation has prompted India and several other countries to tread with caution in the region.</p>

<p>Indian nationals in Israel have been asked to stay vigilant and adhere to the safety protocols following the escalating tension in the region.</p>

<p>The advisory for the Indian citizens in Israel comes a day after the Indian Embassy in Beirut strongly advised Indian nationals against travelling to Lebanon till further notice. It also advised them to leave Lebanon.</p>

<p>Air India yesterday also suspended its flights to and from Israel's Tel Aviv with immediate effect till August 8.</p>

<p></p>

<p>US President Joe Biden said late Thursday he was "very concerned" about rising tensions in the region, adding that the killing of Haniyeh had "not helped" the situation.</p>

<p>Sources close to Hezbollah said that Iranian officials met in Tehran on Wednesday with representatives of the so-called "axis of resistance", a loose alliance of Tehran-backed groups hostile to Israel, to discuss their next steps.</p>

<p>"Two scenarios were discussed: a simultaneous response from Iran and its allies or a staggered response from each party," said the source who had been briefed on the meeting, requesting anonymity to discuss sensitive matters.</p>

<p>Israel, which said Shukr's assassination was a response to deadly rocket fire last week on the annexed Golan Heights, warned its adversaries they would "pay a very high price" for any "aggression".</p>

<p>"Israel is at a very high level of preparation for any scenario, both defensive and offensive," Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Israel's elite intelligence agency Mossad enlisted Iranian security agents to plant explosives in a building in Tehran where armed Palestinian group Hamas's political leader Ismail Haniyeh was staying, The Telegraph reported.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel's elite intelligence agency Mossad enlisted Iranian security agents to plant explosives in a building in Tehran where armed Palestinian group Hamas's political leader Ismail Haniyeh was staying, The Telegraph <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2024/08/02/mossad-hired-iranian-agents-to-plant-bombs-haniyeh-rooms/">reported</a>.</p>

<p>The initial plan was to assassinate Haniyeh in May during his visit to Tehran for the funeral of former Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi. The operation was aborted due to overwhelming crowds, which posed a major risk of failure, according to two Iranian officials who spoke to The Telegraph.</p>

<p>Therefore, the operation had to be modified. Two agents, working under Mossad's direction, placed explosive devices in three separate rooms of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) guesthouse in northern Tehran. This location was strategically chosen as it was likely that Haniyeh would stay there.</p>

<h3><strong>How Mossad Functions&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>With a $3 billion annual budget and 7,000-strong staff, Mossad is the second-largest espionage agency in the West after the CIA.</p>

<p>Mossad has several departments, but the details of its internal structure are mostly hidden. It not only has a network of informants and agents inside Palestinian militant groups, but also in hostile countries like Lebanon, Syria, and Iran. The intelligence agency's vast spy network provides them with intimate knowledge of militant leaders' movements, enabling them to execute precise assassinations as and when necessitated.</p>

<p><strong>Explained </strong>| <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/israel-palestine-mossad-gaza-hamas-attackexplained-how-mossad-functions-and-how-it-failed-to-stop-hamas-attack-4463289">How Mossad Functions And Why It Failed To Stop Hamas Attack</a></p>

<p>The Special Operations Division, also known as Metsada, carries out highly sensitive assassinations, sabotage, paramilitary, and psychological warfare operations.</p>

<h3><strong>Operation To Eliminate Haniyeh</strong></h3>

<p>According to The Telegraph, surveillance footage, held by Iranian officials, shows the agents moving stealthily, entering and exiting multiple rooms within minutes. After planting the devices, they exited Iran undetected but maintained a source within the country. In the early hours of Wednesday, at 2 am, the operatives remotely detonated the explosives in the room where Haniyeh was staying.</p>

<p>The explosion resulted in the death of Haniyeh, who was in Tehran to attend the inauguration of President Masoud Pezeshkian. This assassination has been confirmed by officials within the IRGC, who now believe Mossad employed agents from the Ansar-al-Mahdi protection unit, a group responsible for safeguarding high-ranking officials inside and outside the country.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"This is a humiliation for Iran and a huge security breach," an IRGC official told The Telegraph. A special working group has been established to devise strategies to mitigate the perception of this breach, the official added.</p>

<p><strong>Potential Ramifications</strong></p>

<p>In response to this breach, the IRGC is considering its options for retaliation. A direct strike on Tel Aviv, potentially involving Hezbollah and other Iranian proxies, is reportedly a primary option under evaluation.</p>

<p>Since the Islamic Revolution of 1979 that upended Iran's political and societal structure, the country has made a conscious effort to fan its influence across the Middle East with proxy groups.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Explained</strong> | <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/israel-hamas-palestine-gaza-explained-axis-of-resistance-and-irans-proxy-network-across-middle-east-4534061">Axis Of Resistance And Iran's Proxy Network Across Middle East</a></p>

<p>The Quds Force, one of the five branches of the IRGC, which specialises in intelligence and covert operations, serves as the main point of contact for these proxy groups, providing them with weapons and training to solidify Iran's regional agenda.</p>

<p>The timing of the assassination, coinciding with President Pezeshkian's first day in office, has sparked suspicions about its intentionality. During his campaign, President Pezeshkian had pledged to move away from the Islamic Republic's provocative policies and to restore Iran's standing through dialogue.</p>

<p>President Pezeshkian, a seasoned lawmaker and cardiac surgeon, has<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/masoud-pezeshkian-iran-has-a-new-reformist-president-what-it-would-mean-for-india-6045285"> long supported both domestic and international reforms in Iran</a>. His win in the recent elections is viewed as a call for change since it follows a general unhappiness with the hardline policies of his predecessors. But the dynamics of Iranian politics, where hardliners still control the majority and the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei retains ultimate authority, will put Mr Pezeshkian's ability to carry out his vision to the test.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>New scientific understanding and engineering techniques have always impressed and frightened. No doubt they will continue to. OpenAI recently announced that <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2014-48585-000">it anticipates “superintelligence”</a> – AI surpassing human abilities – this decade. It is accordingly <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-superalignment/">building a new team</a>, and devoting 20% of its computing resources to ensuring that the behaviour of such AI systems will be aligned with human values.</p>

<p>It seems they don't want rogue artificial superintelligences waging war on humanity, as in James Cameron's 1984 science fiction thriller, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088247/">The Terminator</a> (ominously, Arnold Schwarzenegger's terminator is sent back in time from 2029). OpenAI is calling for top machine-learning researchers and engineers to help them tackle the problem.</p>

<p>But might philosophers have something to contribute? More generally, what can be expected of the age-old discipline in the new technologically advanced era that is now emerging?</p>

<p>To begin to answer this, it is worth stressing that philosophy has been instrumental to AI since its inception. One of the first AI success stories was a 1956 <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/154193120605000904">computer program</a>, dubbed the the Logic Theorist, created by Allen Newell and Herbert Simon. Its job was to prove theorems using propositions from Principia Mathematica, a 1910 a three-volume work by the philosophers Alfred North Whitehead and Bertrand Russell, aiming to reconstruct all of mathematics on one logical foundation.</p>

<p>Indeed, the <a href="http://jmc.stanford.edu/articles/mcc59/mcc59.pdf">early focus on logic in AI</a> owed a great deal to the foundational debates pursued by mathematicians and philosophers.</p>

<p>One significant step was the German philosopher Gottlob Frege's development of modern logic in the late 19th century. Frege introduced the use of quantifiable variables – rather than objects such as people – into logic. His approach made it possible to say not only, for example, “Joe Biden is president” but also to systematically express such general thoughts as that “there exists an X such that X is president”, where “there exists” is a quantifier, and “X” is a variable.</p>

<p>Other important contributors in the 1930s were the Austrian-born logician Kurt Gödel, whose theorems of completeness and incompleteness are about the limits of what one can prove, and Polish logician Alfred Tarski's “proof of the indefinability of truth”. The latter showed that “truth” in any standard formal system cannot be defined within that particular system, so that arithmetical truth, for example, cannot be defined within the system of arithmetic.</p>

<p>Finally, the 1936 abstract notion of a computing machine by the British pioneer Alan Turing drew on such development and had a huge impact on early AI.</p>

<p>It might be said, however, that even if such <a href="https://philpapers.org/rec/HAUAIT">good old fashioned</a> symbolic AI was indebted to high-level philosophy and logic, <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262043045/the-promise-of-artificial-intelligence/">the “second-wave” AI</a>, based on deep learning, derives more from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_Data_Happened">concrete engineering feats</a> associated with processing vast quantities of data.</p>

<p>Still, philosophy has played a role here too. Take large language models, such as the one that powers ChatGPT, which produces conversational text. They are enormous models, with billions or even trillions of parameters, trained on vast datasets (typically comprising much of the internet). But at their heart, they track – and exploit – statistical patterns of language use. Something very much like this idea <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12073.Philosophical_Investigations">was articulated</a> by the Austrian philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein in the middle of the 20th century: “the meaning of a word”, he said, “is its use in the language”.</p>

<p>But contemporary philosophy, and not just its history, is relevant to AI and its development. Could an LLM truly understand the language it processes? Might it achieve consciousness? These are deeply philosophical questions.</p>

<p>Science has so far been unable to fully explain how consciousness arises from the cells in the human brain. Some philosophers even believe that this is such a “hard problem” that is <a href="https://theconversation.com/the-mystery-of-consciousness-shows-there-may-be-a-limit-to-what-science-alone-can-achieve-225034">beyond the scope of science</a>, and may require a helping hand of philosophy.</p>

<p>In a similar vein, we can ask whether an image generating AI could be truly creative. Margaret Boden, a British cognitive scientist and philosopher of AI, argues that while AI will be able to produce new ideas, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0004370298000551">it will struggle to evaluate them</a> as creative people do.</p>

<p>She <a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/ai-9780198777984?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;">also anticipates</a> that only a hybrid (neural-symbolic) architecture – one that uses both the logical techniques and <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14539">deep learning</a> from data – will achieve artificial general intelligence.</p>

<h2>Human values</h2>

<p>To return to OpenAI's announcement, when prompted with our question about the role of philosophy in the age of AI, ChatGPT suggested to us that (amongst other things) it “helps ensure that the development and use of AI are aligned with human values”.</p>

<p>In this spirit, perhaps we can be allowed to propose that, if AI alignment is the serious issue that OpenAI believes it to be, it is not just a technical problem to be solved by engineers or tech companies, but also a social one. That will require input from philosophers, but also social scientists, lawyers, policymakers, citizen users and others.</p>

<p>Indeed, many people are worried about the <a href="https://www.wiley.com/en-ie/Why+AI+Undermines+Democracy+and+What+To+Do+About+It-p-9781509560929">rising power and influence</a> of tech companies and their impact on democracy. Some argue we need a whole new way of thinking about AI – taking into account the underlying systems supporting the industry. The British barrister and author Jamie Susskind, for example, has argued it is time to build a “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jun/19/the-digital-republic-by-jamie-susskind-review-why-the-west-was-no-match-for-the-tech-giants">digital republic</a>” – one which ultimately rejects the very political and economic system that has given tech companies so much influence.</p>

<p>Finally, let us briefly ask, how will AI affect philosophy? Formal logic in philosophy actually dates to Aristotle's work in antiquity. In the 17th century. the German philosopher Gottfried Leibniz suggested that we may one day have a <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-93779-3_4">“calculus ratiocinator”</a> – a calculating machine that would help us to derive answers to philosophical and scientific questions in a quasi-oracular fashion.</p>

<p>Perhaps we are now beginning to realise that vision, with some authors advocating a <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11229-020-02950-3">“computational philosophy”</a> that literally encodes assumptions and derives consequences from them. This ultimately allows factual and/or value-oriented assessments of the outcomes.</p>

<p>For example, <a href="https://polygraphs.sites.northeastern.edu/">the PolyGraphs project</a> simulates the effects of information sharing on social media. This can then be used to computationally address questions about how we ought to form our opinions.</p>

<p>Certainly, progress in AI has given philosophers plenty to think about; it may even have begun to provide some answers.<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jeff Bezos's net worth shrank by $15.2 billion Friday, leading a wide-ranging slump that erased $134 billion from the fortunes of the 500 richest people in the world.</p>

<p>Shares of Amazon.com Inc. slid 8.8% amid a broader selloff in the market, dropping Bezos' net worth to $191.5 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The one-day wipeout is his third-worst, trailing only April 4, 2019, when the Amazon co-founder's wealth tumbled $36 billion following his divorce settlement, and April 29, 2022, when Amazon shares plunged 14%.</p>

<p>The Nasdaq 100 Index fell 2.4%, dragging down the fortunes of other tech billionaires including Elon Musk and Oracle Corp.'s Larry Ellison, whose net worths were pared $6.6 billion and $4.4 billion, respectively. Uncertainty over possible Federal Reserve rate cuts, as well as some high-profile earnings disappointments, have helped plunge the tech-heavy index into correction territory, wiping out more than $2 trillion in value in just over three weeks.</p>

<p>Investors have also become jittery over fears that this year's AI-fueled gains are overdone or the market is too concentrated. The decline in Amazon shares - the biggest drop since April 2022 - came after the company said on an earnings call that it planned to continue spending big on AI even at the expense of short-term profits.</p>

<p>Technology billionaires Mark Zuckerberg, Sergey Brin and Larry Page also each lost more than $3 billion Friday as shares of Meta Platforms Inc. and Alphabet fell in New York trading. Tech tycoons in total saw $68 billion carved from their fortunes, according to Bloomberg's wealth index.</p>

<p>Bezos, 60, the world's second-richest person, has been steadily offloading Amazon shares this year. He sold stock worth about $8.5 billion over nine trading days in February. And on a day last month when Amazon hit a fresh record, he disclosed a plan to sell 25 million additional shares worth $5 billion.</p>

<p>The additional sales would bring his total this year to roughly $13.5 billion, according to Bloomberg's calculations. He would still hold almost 912 million shares, or about 8.8% of Amazon, once those sales are complete.</p>

<p>His wealth also derives from space-exploration company Blue Origin and the Washington Post.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The death count from the partial collapse of a residential building in the Russian city of Nizhny Tagil has risen to 10, said the Ministry of Emergency Situations.</p>

<p>The Ministry said on Friday that rescuers have found 10 bodies and 15 people have been rescued from under the rubble, Xinhua news agency reported.</p>

<p>Five people are reportedly in critical condition at a hospital.</p>

<p>Local authorities have declared August 3 as a mourning day for the victims of the tragedy.</p>

<p>According to the Ministry, search and rescue operations are ongoing.</p>

<p>The tragedy occurred on Thursday when two entrances of a five-storey gas-powered building in Nizhny Tagil, a city located in Russia's Sverdlovsk Oblast, caved in due to an explosion of a gas-air mixture, according to the Ministry of Emergency Situations.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rioting erupted Friday evening in Sunderland, northeast England, where police said officers faced "serious and sustained levels of violence", the latest unrest linked to a mass stabbing earlier this week that killed three young girls.</p>

<p>Eight people were arrested and three officers required hospital treatment following hours of "utterly deplorable" disturbances, Northumbria Police Chief Superintendent Helena Barron said.</p>

<p>Two officers remained in hospital early Saturday, she added.</p>

<p>Footage broadcast by the BBC showed a mob of several hundred rampaging in Sunderland's city centre, attacking police and setting fire to at least one car and a building next to a police office.</p>

<p>Other images shared on social media showed balaclava-clad youths throwing bricks and other missiles as fireworks and flares were let off.</p>

<p>"The shocking scenes we have witnessed in Sunderland this evening are completely unacceptable," Barron said, adding the "disorder, violence and damage" seen "will not be tolerated".</p>

<p>"A full investigation is now under way to identify anyone else responsible" in addition to the eight people arrested, she added.</p>

<p>The disorder came as police nationwide prepared for planned far-right rallies and other demonstrations this weekend, after two nights of unrest in several English towns and cities in the wake of Monday's knife attack.</p>

<p>London's Metropolitan Police said it had a "proportionate and risk-based" plan for rival pro-Palestinian and anti-immigration protests Saturday. Its officers arrested 111 people as a rally in Westminster turned violent late Wednesday.</p>

<p>But Friday night's disturbances in Sunderland, after a calm night nationwide Thursday, were an ominous sign for the coming days.</p>

<p>'Deeply anxious'</p>

<p>Responding to events there, interior minister Yvette Cooper vowed rioters will "pay the price for their violence and thuggery". She gave police "the full backing of government to take the strongest possible action and ensure they face the full force of the law".</p>

<p>"They do not represent Britain," Cooper said.</p>

<p>Earlier, Merseyside Police said extra officers had been deployed in and around Liverpool city centre "to help prevent disorder or criminality" there. Despite a minor skirmish near a mosque, the evening passed off peacefully.</p>

<p>Liverpool lies close to the seaside town of Southport where Monday's knife attack occurred.</p>

<p>Far-right elements have been blamed for the disturbances in the aftermath of the stabbing spree targeting children at a Taylor Swift-themed dance party.</p>

<p>Officials have said online disinformation about the British-born 17-year-old suspect Axel Rudakubana helped fuel the unrest.</p>

<p>He faces murder and attempted murder charges over the stabbing rampage that also left five children and two adults critically wounded.</p>

<p>Police have said the case is not being treated as terror-related but have not revealed a motive.</p>

<p>Anger over the tragedy has fused with growing anti-immigration sentiment on the right of English politics, pushed by openly Islamophobic far-right figures.</p>

<p>After violence in Southport late Tuesday, unrest rocked the northern cities of Hartlepool and Manchester as well as London 24 hours later.</p>

<p>In Southport, the mob targeted a mosque, prompting hundreds of Muslim places of worship across the country to step up security amid fears of more anti-Islamic demonstrators.</p>

<p>Faith leaders say mosques have been hiring paid security staff and checking their CCTV cameras are working.</p>

<p>"The Muslim community is deeply anxious right now," Zara Mohammed, secretary-general of the Muslim Council of Britain, told AFP.</p>

<p>'Sow hatred'</p>

<p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer has accused "thugs" of "hijacking" the nation's grief to "sow hatred" and pledged that anyone carrying out violent acts will "face the full force of the law".</p>

<p>In power for less than a month, Starmer met Friday with local leaders in Southport to discuss "a package of support for the local community", his Downing Street office said.</p>

<p>Starmer's visit came the day after he announced a new "national capability" to tackle disorder in the wake of the recent disturbances.</p>

<p>The new measures will allow the sharing of intelligence, wider deployment of facial-recognition technology and criminal behaviour orders to restrict troublemakers from travelling.</p>

<p>The police alert for the weekend comes after far-right social media channels advertised "enough is enough" anti-immigrant rallies, and anti-facism groups vowed to stage counter-protests.</p>

<p>"Enough is enough" has emerged as a rallying online slogan for the far-right and others following Monday's attack.</p>

<p>South Yorkshire police said Friday they knew of a planned protest in the town of Rotherham, while officers in south Wales said they were preparing for events being planned for Saturday in Cardiff.</p>

<p>Police in Northern Ireland noted social media posts calling for roadblocks "using women and children", as well as a march to an Islamic centre in Belfast on Saturday.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iran and its regional allies vowed retaliation for the deaths of Hamas and Hezbollah leaders, raising regional tensions as mourners filled Tehran's city centre calling for revenge.<br />
<br />
A public funeral was held for Hamas's political chief Ismail Haniyeh in the Iranian capital where he was killed early Wednesday in an attack on which Israel has not commented.</p>

<p>Haniyeh's body was then flown to Qatar, where he had resided and where he will be laid to rest on Friday, when his group called for a "day of furious rage" in the Palestinian territories and across the region.</p>

<p>Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah, addressing the funeral of the Lebanese group's top military commander, said Israel and "those who are behind it must await our inevitable response" to Fuad Shukr's and Haniyeh's killings within hours of each other.</p>

<p>"You do not know what red lines you crossed," Nasrallah said, addressing Israel, a day after Shukr was killed in a strike in south Beirut.</p>

<p>Israel, which said Shukr's assassination was a response to deadly rocket fire last week on the annexed Golan Heights, warned its adversaries on Thursday they would "pay a very high price" for any "aggression".</p>

<p>"Israel is at a very high level of preparation for any scenario, both defensive and offensive," Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement.</p>

<p>"Those who attack us, we will attack in return."</p>

<p>A source close to Hezbollah told AFP that Iranian officials met in Tehran on Wednesday with representatives of the so-called "axis of resistance", a loose alliance of Tehran-backed groups hostile to Israel, to discuss their next steps.</p>

<p>"Two scenarios were discussed: a simultaneous response from Iran and its allies or a staggered response from each party," said the source who had been briefed on the meeting, requesting anonymity to discuss sensitive matters.</p>

<p>The leader of Yemen's Iran-backed Huthi rebels vowed a "military response" to Israel's "major escalation".</p>

<p>Analysts told AFP that the retaliation would be measured to avoid a wider conflagration.</p>

<p>Iran and the groups it backs "will more than likely try to avert a war, while also strongly deterring Israel from continuing with this new policy, this targeted shock and awe," said Amal Saad, a Hezbollah researcher and lecturer at Britain's Cardiff University.</p>

<p>In Tehran, Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei led prayers for Haniyeh, having earlier threatened "harsh punishment" for his killing.</p>

<p><strong>- 'Roaring marches' -</strong></p>

<p>Crowds, including women shrouded in black, carried posters of Haniyeh and Palestinian flags in a procession and ceremony that began at Tehran University, an AFP correspondent reported.</p>

<p>Senior Iranian officials, including President Masoud Pezeshkian and Revolutionary Guards chief General Hossein Salami, attended the ceremony, state television images showed.</p>

<p>Iran's Revolutionary Guards announced the day before that Haniyeh and a bodyguard were killed in a pre-dawn strike Wednesday on their accommodation in Tehran.</p>

<p>The New York Times however reported, citing anonymous sources including two Iranian officials, that the blast was caused by an explosive device planted several months ago.</p>

<p>When asked about the report, Israeli military spokesman Daniel Hagari told reporters "there was no other Israeli aerial attack... in all the Middle East" on the night of Shukr's killing.</p>

<p>Qatar-based Haniyeh had been visiting Tehran for Pezeshkian's swearing-in on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Pezeshkian said Iran "will continue to support with firmer determination the axis of resistance", the official IRNA news agency said.</p>

<p>Qatar-based network Al Jazeera reported that the plane carrying Haniyeh's body had landed in Doha, where the Palestinian leader is to be buried following prayers at the Qatari capital's largest mosque.</p>

<p>Hamas called in a statement for a day of protests on Friday.</p>

<p>"Let roaring anger marches start from every mosque," it said.</p>

<p><strong>- Regional tensions -</strong></p>

<p>The international community has called for calm and a focus on securing a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip -- which Haniyeh had accused Israel of obstructing.</p>

<p>US President Joe Biden said late Thursday he was "very concerned" about rising tensions in the region, adding that the killing of Haniyeh had "not helped" the situation.</p>

<p>The White House said Biden spoke with Netanyahu by phone on Thursday, promising to defend Israel's security "against all threats from Iran".</p>

<p>"We have the basis for a ceasefire. He should move on it and they should move on it now," Biden told reporters after the call.</p>

<p>The prime minister of key ceasefire broker Qatar said Haniyeh's assassination had thrown the whole Gaza war mediation process into doubt.</p>

<p>"How can mediation succeed when one party assassinates the negotiator on the other side?" Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani said on social media site X.</p>

<p>The killings are the latest of several major incidents that have inflamed regional tensions during the Gaza war which has drawn in Iran-backed militant groups in Syria, Lebanon, Iraq and Yemen.</p>

<p>Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas in retaliation for its October 7 attack that resulted in the deaths of 1,197 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 31-year-old Indian national was rushed to a hospital in Vietnam's capital Hanoi after experiencing severe abdominal pain due to a live eel he had inserted into his anus, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://vietnamnews.vn/society/1660152/expat-put-live-eel-into-anus-gets-colon-punctured.html">a report said</a>. &nbsp;</p>

<p>On July 27, The man <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/08/01/world-news/live-2-foot-eel-chews-through-mans-intestines-after-he-put-it-up-his-anus/">arrived at the hospital in excruciating pain</a>, prompting immediate medical attention. The doctors reported that the patient had inserted the eel earlier in the day, leading to a desperate attempt by the eel to escape. The creature bit through the patient's rectum and colon, entering the abdominal cavity.</p>

<p>Imaging tests, including an X-ray, revealed the eel's skeleton lodged within the patient's abdomen. Initial efforts to remove the eel through the anus were hindered by another foreign object - a lemon - that had been inserted and blocked the passage, prompting the medical team to initiate an emergency surgery.</p>

<p>During the surgery, doctors discovered the live eel, measuring over 25 inches in length and about 4 inches in diameter, inside the patient's abdominal cavity. Both the eel and the lemon were successfully removed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Due to the significant contamination and the presence of fecal matter in the abdominal cavity, a colostomy was performed, the report added.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pakistan's jailed former prime minister Imran Khan has refused to undergo polygraph and voice matching tests as part of an investigation by Lahore police in connection with a dozen cases related to the unprecedented May 9 riots last year.</p>

<p>A 12-member forensic team reached Adiala Jail on Tuesday to conduct the polygraph test on the 71-year-old cricketer-turned-politician.</p>

<p>The May 9 riots in 2023 were triggered across the country after the Pakistan-Tehreek-e-Insaf founder was arrested by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) in a 190-million-pound corruption case. He faces over 200 cases and has been in jail since August last year.</p>

<p>The Lahore police team, led by a Deputy Superintendent of Police, arrived at the prison premises to conduct the tests, the Express Tribune reported.</p>

<p>They were accompanied by experts from the Punjab Forensic Science Agency (PFSA), the report said.</p>

<p>The PFSA experts were to perform polygraph, voice matching, and photogrammetry tests on the former prime minister.</p>

<p>The PTI founder answered the questions of the police for 15 minutes. However, Imran Khan refused to undergo the polygraph test and other tests planned by the Punjab Forensic Science Agency's team, the Nation newspaper reported.</p>

<p>Imran Khan said he was under investigation by many institutions and he would give time to the police after the completion of his earlier inquiries, it said.</p>

<p>The police officials also questioned him about various aspects of the May 9 riots that targeted the Lahore corps commander's residence, military installations and public properties, the Dawn newspaper reported.</p>

<p>Following their visit, the police team and PFSA experts briefed Lahore DIG Investigation Zeeshan Asghar on Imran Khan's lack of cooperation. The matter will be discussed in a meeting of senior police officers to devise a strategy for a follow-up visit in consultation with the prosecution department, the report said.</p>

<p>During the May 9 protests, alleged PTI workers and supporters attacked and vandalised military installations including the General Headquarters as well as monuments.</p>

<p>After the unprecedented violence, authorities swung into action and initiated a massive crackdown against the PTI while also holding trials of over 100 PTI workers in military courts.</p>

<p>Civil and military authorities have been accusing Imran Khan of planning the May 9 conspiracy ahead of his arrest, a claim vehemently rejected by him and his party.</p>

<p>Imran Khan denied giving orders for vandalising state properties but did acknowledge that he had asked his party to stage a peaceful protest outside the GHQ in case of his arrest.</p>

<p>Imran Khan has been imprisoned at the high-security Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi for almost a year upon his conviction in three cases - the Toshakhana corruption case, the cipher case, and the un-Islamic marriage case -- in which his wife, Bushra Bibi, is also jailed.</p>

<p>Though the former-cricketer-turned-politician had secured bail or his conviction was set aside, he has not been released.</p>

<p>Imran Khan was arrested on August 5 last year after his conviction in the first Toshakhana corruption case filed by the Election Commission of Pakistan. Since then, he has been kept in jail in various cases.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A car bomb injured an officer from Russia's military intelligence agency in northern Moscow on Wednesday, the Kommersant newspaper reported.</p>

<p>Russia's interior ministry said that two people were injured in a blast caused by the detonation of an unidentified device and said that a criminal case had been opened.</p>

<p>Alexander Bortnikov, head of the Federal Security Service (FSB), told the SHOT Telegram channel that the suspect had fled to Turkey and that the FSB was working to extradite the individual.</p>

<p>Later on Wednesday, Turkish Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said in a post on X that a Russian citizen suspected of the attack had been arrested in Bodrum, having arrived from Moscow by plane.</p>

<p>Footage shared by Russian media showed an explosion ripping through a Toyota Land Cruiser shortly after the officer and an unidentified woman got into the vehicle.</p>

<p>Kommersant, one of Russia's leading newspapers, said that the injured man served in the Main Directorate of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, widely referred to as GRU.</p>

<p>Baza, which has sources in Russia's security services, also said the injured man was a GRU officer.</p>

<p>State news agency TASS said that an officer and his wife had been injured in the blast. The man's feet were blown off, according to TASS. Five other cars were damaged in the blast, the agency said.</p>

<p>Reuters was unable to independently verify the reports.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The Earth experienced its hottest day in at least 84 years on July 22, with the global average temperature reaching a record high of 17.15 degrees Celsius, according to the European Union's Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S).]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Earth experienced its hottest day in at least 84 years on July 22, with the global average temperature reaching a record high of 17.15 degrees Celsius, according to the European Union's Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S).</p>

<p>This exceeded the previous record of 17.09 degrees Celsius, set just a day before on July 21.</p>

<p>These unprecedented temperatures follow a series of monthly heat records -- June marked the 12th consecutive month of global temperatures reaching or exceeding the 1.5 degrees Celsius threshold. Every month since June last year has been the warmest on record.</p>

<p>Preliminary data from C3S showed that July 22 was the hottest day since at least 1940.</p>

<p>C3S said global temperatures are now the highest they have been for around 1,25,000 years, as a result of climate change caused by burning coal, oil and gas, and deforestation.</p>

<p>"While scientists cannot be certain that Monday was the very hottest day throughout that period, average temperatures have not been this high since long before humans developed agriculture," it said.</p>

<p>C3S data showed that before July 2023, the Earth's daily average temperature record, set in August 2016, was 16.8 degrees Celsius. However, since July 3, 2023, there have been 57 days with temperatures exceeding that previous record.</p>

<p>Carlo Buontempo, director of C3S, said the difference between the temperatures over the past 13 months and previous records is staggering.</p>

<p>"We are now in truly uncharted territory and as the climate continues to warm, we are bound to see new records in the coming months and years," he said.</p>

<p>Christiana Figueres, the head of UN climate negotiations from 2010 to 2016, said: "The much-used term 'unprecedented' no longer describes the horrific temperatures we are experiencing." "G20 nations are confronted with a dangerous reality they must address with policies to accelerate the deployment of renewables and prudent phaseout of fossil fuels. One third of global electricity can be produced by solar and wind alone, but targeted national policies have to enable that transformation. Or we all scorch and fry," she said.</p>

<p>Analysis shows that 2023 and 2024 have seen significantly higher annual maximum daily global temperatures compared to previous years. The 10 years with the highest daily average temperatures are from 2015 to 2024.</p>

<p>The global average temperature usually peaks between late June and early August, driven by the northern hemisphere's summer. The land masses in the northern hemisphere warm up faster than the southern hemisphere's oceans can cool down.</p>

<p>With global average temperatures already at near-record levels, a new daily average temperature record was not completely unexpected.</p>

<p>C3S scientists attributed the sudden rise in daily global temperatures to much higher-than-average temperatures over large parts of Antarctica. Such large anomalies are not uncommon during the Antarctic winter and also contributed to record global temperatures in early July 2023.</p>

<p>The Antarctic Sea ice extent is almost as low as it was last year, leading to above-average temperatures over parts of the Southern Ocean.</p>

<p>As the global average temperature typically peaks between late June and early August, scientists expect it to rise further on July 23, 2024, before decreasing.</p>

<p>The European climate agency said whether 2024 will be the warmest year ever depends largely on the development and intensity of La Nina. While 2024 has been warm enough to surpass 2023, the exceptional warmth of the last four months of 2023 makes it too early to predict with certainty which year will be warmer.</p>

<p>Climate science non-profit Berkeley Earth estimated last week that 2024 has a 92 per cent chance of setting a new annual heat record.</p>

<p>There is a 99 per cent chance that 2024 will have an annual average temperature anomaly of more than 1.5 degrees Celsius above the 1850-1900 average, it said.</p>

<p>At the 2015 UN climate talks in Paris, world leaders committed to limiting the global average temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial period average to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. However, a permanent breach of the 1.5-degree Celsius limit specified in the Paris Agreement refers to long-term warming over a 20 or 30-year period.</p>

<p>The Earth's global surface temperature has already increased by around 1.2 degrees Celsius due to the rapidly increasing concentration of greenhouse gases, primarily carbon dioxide and methane, in the atmosphere. This warming is considered to be the reason behind record droughts, wildfires and floods worldwide.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris assailed Donald Trump on Tuesday at her first campaign rally since replacing President Joe Biden as the Democratic presidential candidate.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris assailed Donald Trump on Tuesday at her first campaign rally since replacing President Joe Biden as the Democratic presidential candidate, while a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll showed her taking a marginal lead over her Republican rival.</p>

<p>In a 17-minute speech, Harris aggressively went after Trump's vulnerabilities, comparing her background as a former prosecutor to his record as a convicted felon.</p>

<p>Harris ticked through a list of liberal priorities, saying that if elected she would act to expand abortion access, make it easier for workers to join unions and address gun violence, drawing a sharp contrast with Trump, the Republican nominee for president in the Nov. 5 election.</p>

<p>"Donald Trump wants to take our country backward," she told a cheering crowd of several thousand at West Allis Central High School in a Milwaukee suburb in Wisconsin, a battleground state with a pivotal role in deciding the election outcome.</p>

<p>"Do we want to live in a country of freedom, compassion and rule of law, or a country of chaos, fear and hate?"</p>

<p>The raucous rally was a notable contrast to the smaller, more subdued events Biden held, underscoring Democrats' hope that Harris, 59, can revive what had been a flagging campaign under Biden, 81. The audience danced and waved Harris signs, while chants of "Ka-ma-la!" broke out when she took the stage.</p>

<p>She emphasized her commitment to reproductive rights, an issue that has plagued Republicans since the U.S. Supreme Court - powered by three Trump-appointed justices - eliminated a nationwide right to abortion in 2022.</p>

<p>Harris led Trump 44% to 42% among registered voters in the national Reuters/Ipsos poll, conducted on Monday and Tuesday after Biden dropped out of the contest on Sunday and endorsed Harris as his successor.</p>

<p>A Reuters/Ipsos poll last week showed Biden, before he ended his campaign, trailing Trump by two percentage points.</p>

<p>Both were within the poll's three-point margin of error. But the results could signal limited movement in Democrats' direction - and may suggest that Harris' elevation to the top of the ticket blunted whatever momentum Trump hoped to gain from last week's Republican National Convention, also in Milwaukee.</p>

<p>Trump and his allies have tried to tether Harris to some of Biden's more unpopular policies, including his administration's handling of the surge of migrants at the southern border with Mexico.</p>

<p>In a conference call with reporters on Tuesday, Trump expressed confidence in his ability to defeat Harris, noting that her previous presidential run in 2020 did not even survive until the first statewide nominating contest.</p>

<p>Trump offered to debate Harris multiple times. Trump and Biden had one more debate scheduled on Sept. 10 after their encounter on June 27. Biden's poor performance that night led to Democratic calls for him to step aside.</p>

<p>"I want to debate her, and she'll be no different because they have the same policies," Trump said.</p>

<h3><strong>A SWIFT RISE</strong></h3>

<p>Harris swiftly consolidated her party's support after Biden, 81, abandoned his reelection campaign under pressure from members of his party who worried about his ability to beat Trump, 78, or to serve for another four-year term.</p>

<p>She wrapped up the nomination on Monday night by winning pledges from a majority of the delegates who at next month's party convention will determine the nominee, the campaign said.</p>

<p>Her campaign said it had raised $100 million since Sunday.</p>

<p>Most Democratic lawmakers have lined up behind her candidacy, including the party's leaders in the Senate and House, Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries, who endorsed Harris on Tuesday at a joint press conference.</p>

<p>Harris' rise dramatically reshapes an election in which many voters were unhappy with their options. As the first Black woman and Asian American to serve as vice president, she would make further history as the first woman elected U.S. president.</p>

<p>Wisconsin is among a trio of Rust Belt states, along with Michigan and Pennsylvania, that are critical to Democrats' chances of defeating Trump.</p>

<p>Alyssa Wahlborg, 19, vice chair of the Whitewater College Democrats, said Harris had reenergized young voters, particularly women who want Harris to break the ultimate U.S. glass ceiling.</p>

<p>"I talked to my grandmom. We are both excited that she may live to see the first woman president," said Wahlberg, who was attending Tuesday's rally. "It's taken too long."</p>

<p>Saddled with concerns that included his health and persistent high prices crimping Americans' household finances, Biden had been losing ground against Trump in opinion polls, particularly in the competitive states that are likely to decide the election, including the Sun Belt states of Arizona and Nevada.</p>

<h3><strong>BIDEN TO ADDRESS NATION</strong></h3>

<p>Biden said on X that he would deliver a Wednesday night Oval Office speech explaining his decision to end his campaign. He returned to Washington on Tuesday after spending several days isolating at home with COVID-19. The president has tested negative and no longer has symptoms, the White House doctor said in a letter on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Biden's dramatic exit followed Trump's narrow survival of a July 13 assassination attempt that raised questions about security failures in the U.S. Secret Service. The agency director, Kimberly Cheatle, resigned on Tuesday.</p>

<p>The Washington Post reported that Secret Service officials have encouraged the Trump campaign to stop holding outdoor rallies like the one in Butler, Pennsylvania, where Trump was wounded in the right ear. The Post cited unnamed people familiar with the matter. The Secret Service and the Trump campaign did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p>

<p>Democratic National Committee chair Jaime Harrison, in an interview on NBC's "Today" program, said the party had to move quickly to get the ticket on ballots in all 50 states, and that Harris' vice presidential pick needed to be made by Aug. 7.</p>

<p>Potential running mates include Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear, U.S. Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg, North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper, Arizona Senator Mark Kelly, Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro and Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>British telecommunications regulator Ofcom said Wednesday it had handed video sharing platform TikTok a 1.9 million pound ($2.4 million) fine for failing to timely make available safety data.</p>

<p>Ofcom criticised the platform, which is owned by Chinese group ByteDance, saying it communicated inaccurate information last year and failed swiftly to address that.</p>

<p>"Ofcom has today fined TikTok £1.875 million for failing to accurately respond to a formal request for information about its parental controls safety feature," the regulator said in a statement.</p>

<p>In a statement to AFP, TikTok recognised it had furnished Ofcom with inaccurate data on the use of a parental controls tool that underestimated "considerably" the number of people using the tool.</p>

<p>"While we subsequently provided the correct information, we fell short of our obligations by not reporting the error sooner, and apologise for any disruption this caused.</p>

<p>"We are committed to fully cooperating with all of Ofcom's requests and have implemented improvements to our internal processes," a TikTok spokesperson said, adding that Ofcom had recognised the oversight was not deliberate.</p>

<p>Noting the breach was a first for the platform, bringing a fine 25 percent below its maximum, Ofcom said "significant weight was also given to the fact that, notwithstanding its failings, TikTok proactively self-reported the error to us and has since taken steps to improve its internal processes."</p>

<p>But the regulator said the failing had forced it to remove details on the effectiveness of TikTok's parental controls in an upcoming transparency report.</p>

<p>Ofcom said it received only partial, if accurate, information data seven months after a deadline last year.</p>

<p>It added it believed that the penalty was appropriate for a company of TikTok's size, given its resources and awareness of regulatory obligations.</p>

<p>The move comes a week after TikTok lost an appeal to escape new EU digital rules that seek to rein in the power of big tech after a court rejected its challenge.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Keir Starmer faced his first House of Commons grilling as UK prime minister on Wednesday, after suspending seven of his own Labour MPs for rebelling over a controversial welfare policy.</p>

<p>Starmer suspended the Labour rebels late Tuesday after they backed a motion demanding the removal of the contentious two-child limit on benefits introduced by the previous Conservative government.</p>

<p>Their votes supporting ending the cap -- introduced in 2015 and which restricts payments to the first two children born to most families -- is an early test of Starmer's authority.</p>

<p>The new UK leader has warned there is "no silver bullet" to ending child poverty but acknowledged the "passion" of MPs who oppose maintaining the policy.</p>

<p>"The last Labour government lifted millions of children out of poverty, something we are very, very proud of," Starmer said at his first Prime Minister's Questions as UK leader, referring to ex-premier Gordon Brown who left office in 2010.</p>

<p>"And this government will approach the question with the same vigour with our new taskforce. Already we've taken steps," he added, referring to breakfast clubs in schools and abolishing no-fault evictions for tenants.</p>

<p>Starmer's decision to suspend the whip from the group of left-wingers, which included former finance spokesman John McDonnell, was seen as a show of ruthlessness from his new administration.</p>

<p>The Labour leader took power just weeks ago after his party, in opposition for 14 years, won a landslide in the July 4 general election.</p>

<p>The victory followed a four-year struggle since he became party leader to shift Labour back to the political centre ground from the hard-left regime of former leader Jeremy Corbyn.</p>

<p>The party in 2019 experienced its worst election result in nearly a century under Corbyn.</p>

<h3><strong>'Serious matter'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Despite the question on the two-child cap rebellion, Starmer enjoyed a largely amicable first Prime Minister's Questions session, with his defeated opponent at the election Rishi Sunak lobbing a series of soft-ball questions at his successor.</p>

<p>"I'm glad in our exchanges so far we have maintained a cross-party consensus on important matters of foreign policy and in that spirit today, I wanted to focus our exchange on Ukraine and national security," Sunak said.</p>

<p>Late Tuesday, MPs voted 363 to 103 to reject a Scottish National Party (SNP) amendment to scrap the two-child benefit cap, giving the government a majority of 260.</p>

<p>However, in addition to the seven who voted with the amendment, more than 40 Labour lawmakers recorded no vote, highlighting the level of unease within the centre-left party at the measure.</p>

<p>The vote tried to force a change to the government's legislative agenda for the coming months, which it laid out in last week's King's Speech.</p>

<p>Kim Johnson, a Labour MP for Liverpool, said she had voted with the government "for unity" but warned "the campaign will continue".</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pakistan's powerful army sent its officers to London in 2022 to convince former prime minister Nawaz Sharif to return to the country to "save" it from destruction under Imran Khan's regime, the ruling PML-N supremo's son-in-law claimed on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Nawaz, 74, had returned from London in October last year after spending four years in self-imposed exile on medical grounds. Upon his arrival, he was acquitted in all the cases he was facing including the Al-Azizia Mills corruption case in which he was serving a seven-year imprisonment before leaving for the UK.</p>

<p>"The Army had gone to London (in 2022) and touched the knees of Nawaz Sharif and requested him to come to Pakistan and save it from the destruction of (former prime minister) Imran Khan," Capt Muhammad Safdar (retd.) while addressing party workers of the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N). He said when Nawaz returned to become prime minister for the fourth time then the powerful circles (a reference to the powerful military) decided against it.</p>

<p>"To stop him from becoming the premier they ensured that Nawaz lost the election from NA-15 Mansehra," he said and chided the Election Commission of Pakistan for manipulating the result of Nawaz, a three-time former prime minister.</p>

<p>Interestingly, Nawaz had won Lahore's seat in the February 8 general election which Khan's party Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf alleged that he had also lost this seat but the ECP declared him successful in the country's worst-ever rigged polls.</p>

<p>Nawaz himself had admitted that he was a candidate to become premier but his party failed to get a simple majority therefore it was decided that his younger brother Shehbaz Sharif should be made the prime minister.</p>

<p>The PTI has alleged that the PML-N had won only six per cent seats of the National Assembly and the military establishment gifted dozens of its winning seats after getting the results changed through ECP to the PML-N so that its puppet setup led by Shehbaz Sharif could come to power and serve its interests.</p>

<p>PML-N sources said that Nawaz had agreed not to contest for the Prime Minister's slot after the military establishment offered him to make his daughter Maryam Nawaz Punjab Chief Minister.</p>

<p>The powerful Army, which has ruled the coup-prone country for more than half of its 75-plus years of existence, has hitherto wielded considerable power in the matters of security and foreign policy.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Conflict, economic turbulence and extreme weather scuppered efforts to curb hunger last year, with around nine per cent of the world's population affected, UN agencies said on Wednesday.</p>

<p>About 733 million people may have faced hunger in 2023, a level that has held steady for three years after a steep rise following the COVID-19 pandemic, they said in a report.</p>

<p>But the picture is uneven. While hunger affected one in every five people in Africa, compared with a global average of one in 11, Latin America and the Caribbean progressed and Asia stalled in the goal of eliminating undernourishment.</p>

<p>The broader goal of securing regular access to adequate food for everyone also stalled in that period.</p>

<p>Moderate or severe food insecurity, which forces people to occasionally skip meals, hit 2.33 billion people last year -- almost 29 per cent of the global population.</p>

<p>The report by the Food and Agriculture Organization, the International Fund for Agricultural Development, UNICEF, the World Food Programme and the World Health Organization suggests the UN goal of a world without hunger by 2030 is fading further.</p>

<p>Conflicts, climate chaos and economic downturns are already known as major drivers of food insecurity and malnutrition that combine with underlying factors including persistent inequality, the unaffordability of healthy diets and unhealthy food environments.</p>

<p>But these major drivers are becoming more frequent and intense -- and occurring concurrently more often -- meaning more people are exposed to hunger and food insecurity, the report said.</p>

<p>A healthy diet was unaffordable for more than one-third of the world's population in 2022, the report added, citing updated estimates.</p>

<p>Here too regional inequalities were stark: more than 71 percent of people in low-income countries could not afford healthy diets, compared with just over six percent in high-income nations.</p>

<h3><strong>'No time to lose'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>According to David Laborde, an economist at the Food and Agriculture Organization and one of the report's authors, the post-Covid economic rebound was unequal within and between countries.</p>

<p>Wars and extreme weather events also raged unabated in 2023, but the world has failed to put in place a "Marshall Plan" to bolster funds earmarked for fighting hunger, he told AFP.</p>

<p>The UN agencies' report, which was presented for a G20 summit in Brazil, suggested a major reform of financing food security and nutrition to alleviate the scourge.</p>

<p>This would start with adopting common definitions putting all actors on the same page. According to current estimates, between $176 billion and $3,975 billion are needed to eradicate hunger by 2030.</p>

<p>Yet the "highly fragmented" financial architecture "makes the scale-up and effective implementation of financing for food security and nutrition unfeasible", the report said.</p>

<p>Donors, international agencies, NGOs and foundations must coordinate better as the current set-up lacks shared priorities and is characterised by "an over-proliferation of actors delivering mostly small, short-term projects", it added.</p>

<p>Food security and nutrition is not simply a question of "distributing bags of rice in emergency situations", Laborde said, but also aid to small-scale farmers and access to energy in rural areas that could electrify irrigation systems.</p>

<p>Another weakness of the current system is that donor intentions do not always meet the needs of populations, according to the report.</p>

<p>Debates over animal husbandry in some European countries may discourage investment in intensifying it in Africa, which is necessary, said Laborde.</p>

<p>He pointed to Africa's Sahel region, where chronic instability and military coups have seen donors suspend their aid just as the population needs it most.</p>

<p>The report also recommended developing financial instruments combining private and public funds so that private actors invest in food security, a source of productivity and political stability.</p>

<p>"There is no time to lose, as the cost of inaction greatly exceeds the cost of action this report calls for," it concluded.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli forces carried out new raids in the Gaza Strip on Wednesday, hours before Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was due to address the U.S. Congress.</p>

<p>The latest Israeli attacks destroyed homes in towns east of Khan Younis in southern Gaza and thousands of people were forced to head west to seek shelter, residents said.</p>

<p>The Palestinian Civil Emergency Service said it had received distress calls from residents trapped in their homes in Bani Suhaila, east of Khan Younis, but were unable to reach the town.</p>

<p>Medics later said two Palestinians had been killed in an airstrike on Bani Suhaila, where the armed wing of the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas said fighters had detonated a bomb against an Israeli army personnel carrier.</p>

<p>Israel's military, which is trying to eradicate Hamas after the Oct. 7 attack on Israel, said it had been operating in areas from which fighters had been able to fire rockets into Israel and attack Israeli troops.</p>

<p>Gaza health officials said Israeli military strikes in the past 24 hours had killed at least 55 people, the latest casualties in a war that health authorities in the enclave say has killed more than 39,000 Palestinians.</p>

<p>"Where should we go? Shall we cross into the sea?" said Ghada, who has been displaced with her family six times during the war, via a chat app from Hamad City in northwestern Khan Younis.</p>

<p>"We are exhausted, starved, and want the war to end now, now not an hour later."</p>

<p>Residents said they had been ordered to head west towards a designated humanitarian area, but that the area was now unsafe. The Israeli military issued the evacuation orders on social media, and some residents received orders to leave by phone.</p>

<p>Israeli forces also launched airstrikes on several areas of central and northern Gaza, including one on Al-Bureij camp in central Gaza which health officials said killed nine people.</p>

<h3><strong>PALESTINIANS CRITICISE US</strong></h3>

<p>Hamas-led fighters triggered the war on Oct. 7 by storming into southern Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking 250 captives, according to Israeli tallies. Some 120 hostages are still being held though Israel believes one in three are dead.</p>

<p>Some Palestinians who gathered at a hospital in Khan Younis before funerals criticised the United States, Israel's most important international ally, for welcoming Netanyahu.</p>

<p>He was due to address Congress later on Wednesday and to meet President Joe Biden at the White House on Thursday. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said he would meet Netanyahu in Florida on Friday.</p>

<p>"The United States is a main partner in what is happening in Gaza. We are being killed because of the United States. We are being slaughtered by American planes, American ships, American tanks, and American troops," said Kazem Abu Taha, a displaced resident from Rafah.</p>

<p>A senior Hamas official, Sami Abu Zuhri, told Reuters: "The Congress invitation to Netanyahu to make a speech gives legitimacy to the crimes of the war of genocide in Gaza. Receiving a war criminal is a shame to all Americans."</p>

<p>Israel has rejected accusations brought by South Africa at the U.N.'s top court that its military operation in Gaza is a state-led genocide campaign against Palestinians. It has reacted angrily to a decision by the International Criminal Court's prosecutor to seek an arrest warrant against Netanyahu.</p>

<p>Netanyahu says a deal to release Israelis from captivity in Gaza could be near, but Hamas officials say they see no change in Israel's stance.</p>

<p>Hamas wants a ceasefire agreement to end the war in Gaza. Netanyahu says the war cannot end before Hamas is eradicated.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Heavy rains in the Houston area of Texas have brought out poisonous, foot-long worms that can regenerate if cut in half..]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Heavy rains in the Houston area of Texas have brought out poisonous, foot-long worms that can regenerate if cut in half. The hammerhead flatworm, an invasive species, secretes toxins that can cause skin irritation and is poisonous to pets if ingested.</p>

<p>These worms are often found on lawns, sidewalks and roads after rainstorms, posing a risk to people and animals. They prefer hot and humid climates, experts say.</p>

<p>Ashley Morgan-Olvera, M.S., with the Texas Invasive Species Institute, warned that the worm regenerates. "So if you chop it into two pieces, you get two worms," she told KHOU.</p>

<p>Instead, residents are advised to wear gloves and put the worms in a plastic bag with salt, vinegar or citrus oil, and then freeze them overnight. Touching it is not recommended even if the worm is dead. If touched, wash the affected area with soap and water, and apply hand sanitiser.</p>

<p>The hammerhead worm, also known as a shovelhead or arrowhead, is a menacing pest that gets its name from its distinctive head shape, similar to that of a hammerhead shark. Growing up to 15 inches long, these worms have often even been mistaken for snakes. But what makes them truly dangerous is their toxic slime, which they use to paralyse earthworms - a vital component of crops, gardens and natural environments.</p>

<p>Dr Blake Layton Jr, an entomology expert with Mississippi State University, explains the hammerhead worm's "mouth" stretches out to digest the earthworm's body after coating it with the same toxic slime that causes skin irritation in humans and sickness in animals.</p>

<p>Hammerhead worms also have the potential to carry parasites, making them an even greater threat. When they reproduce asexually, they can create new worms that are genetically identical to the parent, according to KHOU.</p>

<p>As Dr Layton Jr explains, "A portion of the rear of the worm breaks off and grows a new head, producing a new flatworm genetically identical to its parent, a literal 'chip off the old block'."</p>

<p>This means that a single hammerhead worm can quickly become multiple worms, spreading its toxic slime and parasites throughout your yard.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Garment factories and banks reopened in Bangladesh Wednesday after authorities eased a curfew imposed to contain deadly clashes sparked by student protests over civil service employment quotas.</p>

<p>Last week's violence killed at least 186 people, according to an AFP count of victims reported by police and hospitals, during some of the worst unrest of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's tenure.</p>

<p>Thousands of troops are patrolling cities around the South Asian country to keep order, and most Bangladeshis remain without internet nearly a week after a nationwide shutdown was imposed.</p>

<p>But with calm returning to the streets after several days of unbridled mayhem, the country's economically vital textile factories resumed operations after government clearance.</p>

<p>"We were worried about the future of our company," 40-year-old factory worker Khatun, who gave only one name, told AFP.</p>

<p>Despite the disruption, Khatun said she supported the demands of student protesters to reform government hiring rules and was shocked by last week's violence.</p>

<p>"The government should implement all their demands," she said. "A lot of them were killed. They sacrificed for future generations."</p>

<p>The garment industry generates $50 billion in yearly export revenue for Bangladesh, employing millions of young women to sew clothes for H&amp;M, Zara, Gap and other leading international brands.</p>

<p>A spokesperson for the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association told AFP that garment factories had resumed business "across the country".</p>

<p>Hasina's home minister Asaduzzaman Khan agreed to exempt textile workers from an ongoing curfew to allow them to return to work, the peak body's spokesman said.</p>

<p>The curfew was eased Wednesday to allow some commerce to resume but remains in effect for most Bangladeshis for 19 hours each day.</p>

<p>Banks, the stock exchange in the capital Dhaka, and some government offices also opened between 10:00 am and 3:00 pm to match the daily break in the stay-home order, government spokesman Shibli Sadiq told AFP.</p>

<h3><strong>'So much blood'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>The student group which led this month's protests has suspended demonstrations until at least Friday, with one leader saying they had not wanted reform "at the expense of so much blood".</p>

<p>Police have arrested at least 2,500 people since the violence began last week.</p>

<p>Hasina's government says the stay-home order will be relaxed further as the situation improves.</p>

<p>Broadband internet was being gradually restored on Tuesday evening but mobile internet -- a key communication method for protest organisers -- remained inoperative.</p>

<p>Internet connectivity across Bangladesh was still around 20 percent of normal levels, according to data published by US-based monitor Netblocks.</p>

<p>With around 18 million young people in Bangladesh out of work, according to government figures, the June reintroduction of the quota scheme -- halted since 2018 -- deeply upset graduates facing an acute jobs crisis.</p>

<p>Critics say the quota is used to stack public jobs with loyalists to Hasina's Awami League.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court on Sunday cut the number of reserved jobs but fell short of protesters' demands to scrap the quotas entirely.</p>

<p>Hasina, 76, has ruled the country since 2009 and won her fourth consecutive election in January after a vote without genuine opposition.</p>

<p>Her government is also accused by rights groups of misusing state institutions to entrench its hold on power and stamp out dissent, including by the extrajudicial killing of opposition activists.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[At least 50 people have been killed and more than 400 wounded since the start of the protests on June 18, according to rights groups]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dozens of journalists joined marches in Kenya on Wednesday in protest at what they see as heavy-handed government tactics to stifle media freedoms, including police attacks on journalists during the demonstrations that have rocked the country for the past five weeks.</p>

<p>The journalists -- many wearing white -- held placards reading "Journalists lives matter", "Shoot not the messenger" and "End the brutality" as they staged rallies across several towns and cities.</p>

<p>The protests were organised in the wake of attacks on journalists covering the anti-government demonstrations, among other grievances.</p>

<p>Launched last month by young Gen-Z Kenyans over tax increases, the rallies have spiralled into deadly violence and morphed into wider anger against President William Ruto's government.</p>

<p>At least 50 people have been killed and more than 400 wounded since the start of the protests on June 18, according to rights groups.</p>

<p>Journalists covering the events have been shot at, tear-gassed and hit with batons and water cannon, media groups say, further eroding trust in the East African nation's security forces.</p>

<p>"Freedom of the media and freedom of expression generally is on the verge of being eroded, courtesy of a rogue security apparatus," the Kenya Editors Guild said in a statement last week.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, journalists in the capital Nairobi presented a petition to the police headquarters before marching to parliament.</p>

<p>"We are asking for protection from the police and for them to stop shooting and attacking journalists with a lot of excessive force," said the secretary general of the Kenya Union of Journalists, Erick Oduor.</p>

<p><strong>- 'Full-blown conflict' -</strong></p>

<p>State-funded regulator the Media Council of Kenya said it was "deeply concerned" about the deterioration of the relationship between the media and the government.</p>

<p>"What started as a perception about biased media coverage of the 2022 general election has now escalated into full blown conflict pitting the government against the media; resulting in unwarranted threats, blame games, coercion, intimidating and bad blood," it said in a statement on Monday.</p>

<p>Kenya -- an East African economic powerhouse -- has long stood as an oasis of democracy in a volatile region.</p>

<p>Media watchdog Reporters Without Borders, known by its French acronym RSF, ranks Kenya 102nd out of 180 countries on its global list of press freedom, saying "investigations into abuses committed against journalists rarely result in convictions".</p>

<p>Kenyan police are often accused by rights groups of using excessive force and carrying out unlawful killings, especially in poor neighbourhoods.</p>

<p>A Kenyan court this month found police acted unlawfully over the October 2022 killing of Pakistani journalist Arshad Sharif in a town south of Nairobi.</p>

<p>Sharif, a strident critic of Pakistan's powerful military establishment and a supporter of former premier Imran Khan, was shot in the head when Kenyan police opened fire on his car.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former US President Donald Trump is planning to stop holding campaign rallies outdoors in the wake of the 13 July assassination attempt, as per a report in <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-stop-holding-outdoor-rallies-report-us-presidential-election-1929388"><em>Newsweek</em></a>. The team of the Republican contender for 2024 has stated that campaigning will be held indoors for security reasons. Mr Trump might still make an appearance at smaller outdoor rallies, but they will take place in places like stadiums with strictly restricted admissions.</p>

<p>Notably, Mr Trump has hosted hundreds of outdoor rallies since he announced his presidential campaign. For his fans and supporters, these events have taken on the character of festivals, complete with parties and vendors selling campaign memorabilia and products.</p>

<p>The move, which was first reported by the <em>Washington Post</em>, coincides with the resignation of Kimberly Cheatle, the director of the Secret Service, on Tuesday. Ms Cheatle was subjected to a hostile grilling by both Democrats and Republicans before a congressional committee over apparent security lapses before a 20-year-old gunman's attempt on Mr Trump's life.</p>

<p>In a letter of resignation, Ms Cheatle stated she had decided to leave the agency "with a heavy heart," citing the Butler rally as the reason it "fell short" of the agency's mandate to "protect our nation's leaders."</p>

<p>According to the <em>Washington Post </em>report, Mr Trump's team informed the Secret Service that the 2024 re-election campaign intended to host big events and would require more resources and security. However, it is believed that the agency rejected the requests due to a shortage of funding.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the 45th US President was hit in the ear in an assassination bid by a gunman at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania today. Blood was visible on his cheeks and mouth. The shooter was identified as 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks. He has been killed. A spectator was also killed in the shooting and two others were "critically" injured, officials said.</p>

<p>The 78-year-old Republican presidential contender, whose team claimed he was "fine," was attacked shortly as he began his speech. "I knew immediately that something was wrong in that I heard a whizzing sound, shots, and immediately felt the bullet ripping through the skin," Mr Trump said on his Truth Social account.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>People with anxiety could be at three times the risk of developing dementia compared to those without anxiety, according to a study.</p>

<p>People aged 60-70 years with chronic (persistent) anxiety were found to be more likely to develop the mental condition in which memory and decision-making are impaired, affecting daily activities, according to the study published in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society.</p>

<p>Researchers, including those from the University of Newcastle, UK, said that people whose anxiety was resolved did not have a higher dementia risk compared to those who never had it.</p>

<p>Therefore, the researchers suggested that successfully resolving anxieties could help mitigate risk of developing dementia.</p>

<p>"The findings suggest that anxiety may be a new risk factor to target in the prevention of dementia and also indicate that treating anxiety may reduce this risk," Kay Khaing from the University of Newcastle and corresponding author of the study said.</p>

<p>Previous studies examining links between anxiety and dementia have largely measured anxiety at the start, according to the authors.</p>

<p>However, few studies have looked at how persistent anxiety, along with age when one develops anxiety, impacted dementia risk, they said.</p>

<p>For the study, the researchers included more than 2,000 individuals with an average age of 76 years, of whom close to 450 (21 per cent) had anxiety to begin with. The group was followed for over 10 years.</p>

<p>During an intermediate follow-up after five years, the participants were deemed to have 'chronic anxiety' if anxiety persisted and 'new onset anxiety' if they developed it.</p>

<p>Anxiety was measured using the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10), a 10-item questionnaire used as a brief screen to identify distress levels.</p>

<p>Those with chronic anxiety and those who developed anxiety during the study had 2.8 and 3.2 times higher risks of having dementia, respectively, the authors found. The average time taken for dementia diagnosis from the study's start was 10 years, they said.</p>

<p>"Chronic and new anxiety were associated with increased risk of all-cause dementia, and this association was significant in those 70 years and younger," the authors wrote.</p>

<p>They also found that anxiety resolved at follow-up lowered dementia risk levels down to those in people who never had anxiety.</p>

<p>"These results suggest that timely management of anxiety may be a viable strategy in reducing the risk of dementia," the authors wrote.</p>

<p>Possible processes through which anxiety can heighten dementia risk can include inflammation, cell death, along with higher chances of such individuals engaging in unhealthy behaviours, such as physical inactivity and smoking, they said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recounting the harrowing experience of witnessing the Nepal plane crash that claimed 18 lives the eyewitnesses said that if the plane wouldn't have hit the container, it would have definitely hit the residential area.</p>

<p>Eyewitness, Aadesh Lama, who witnessed the crash, said, "I was working here at my garage in the morning and then I heard a loud sound. We thought a tyre had burst but we came to know that a plane had crashed. It had knocked a container, if it wasn't the container then it surely would have slid down and hit the residential area. The container saved us. It struck the container and came to the ground and got engulfed by fire."</p>

<p>Another witness, Krishna Bahadur Thapa, detailed his initial reaction.<br />
"I heard a loud bang, about three to four of us were here. We first assumed it to be a vehicle accident but it turned out to be an aircraft that had crashed. The plane slid down and stopped, at first there was the sound, then after the smoke billowed and then it was engulfed by fire. I rushed near to the site where the plane crashed and there again was an explosion and then I ran backwards with fear," Thapa said while speaking to ANI.</p>

<p>An aircraft of Saurya Airlines crashed during take-off at the Tribhuvan International Airport on Wednesday, Nepal-based daily, The Himalayan Times reported. The plane was scheduled to leave for Pokhara from Kathmandu when the accident happened.</p>

<p>The Tribhuvan International Airport, in an official release, said that 18 dead bodies were recovered from the site and only 1 person survived the crash.</p>

<p>The TIA said "CRJ7 (Reg-9NAME) of Sourya Airlines took off from Kathmandu at 11:11 am local time during the flight to Pokhara, turned right and crashed at a place on the east side of the runway. It is reported that the fire was brought under control and the rescue work was started immediately. The dead bodies of 18 people were recovered and 1 injured person was rescued and taken to the hospital."<br />
The Pilot of the Saurya Airline plane that crashed at the Tribhuvan International Airport (TIA) in Kathmandu is the lone survivor of the crash.</p>

<p>The plane 9N-AME (CRJ 200) was only carrying technical staff of the airline, with no passengers on board. Gyanendra Bhul, information officer at TIA, confirmed that the plane was carrying a few technical staff members.</p>

<p>The plane crashed shortly after taking off from the runway, at around 11:00 AM today. Following the crash, smoke was seen coming from the plane. Firefighters and security personnel, including Nepal Police and the Nepali Army, were deployed to the crash site.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[A French police source told that security is "expecting actions and disturbances around the stadium" on Wednesday and said it was possible that "people shout insults from the stands" or that there is "whistling and flags shown during the match.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Around 1,000 French police officers will be on duty on Wednesday to protect Israel's football match against Mali at the Paris Olympics where protests are also expected, Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said.</p>

<p>The game involving the Israeli team at the Parc des Princes stadium in Paris, as well as the Ukraine-Iraq match in the southeastern city of Lyon, have been identified by French security forces as high risk.</p>

<p>"All the competitions have a security plan, but it's true that these two matches, and particularly the match at the Parc des Princes, will have security, an anti-terror perimeter," Darmanin told BFM television and RMC radio.</p>

<p>"Tonight at the Parc des Princes there will be a thousand police officers who will ensure that we are there for the sport," he added.</p>

<p>All Israeli athletes at the Paris Games, which start officially on Friday, will have round-the-clock personal security provided by elite French police, both inside the Olympic village and every time they leave the compound in northern Paris.</p>

<p>A French police source told AFP that security forces were "expecting actions and disturbances around the stadium" on Wednesday and said it was possible that "people shout insults from the stands" or that there is "whistling and flags shown during the hymns, for example."</p>

<p>The game kicks off 9:00 pm (1900 GMT).</p>

<p>Europalestine, a French activist group behind recent protests, told the Guardian newspaper that it was planning a peaceful demonstration inside the stadium to protest the "genocide" in Gaza.</p>

<p>The head of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) Thomas Bach and French President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday rejected a Palestinian demand that Israel be barred from the Paris Games over the war in Gaza.</p>

<p>The Palestine Olympic Committee asked for a ban on Israel in a letter to the IOC, citing the bombings of the besieged Gaza Strip as a breach of the Olympic truce.</p>

<p>The health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza said Tuesday at least 39,090 people have been killed in more than nine months of war between Israel and Palestinian fighters.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>About 3,000 people carrying bags, water and small children trod through intense heat along a highway in southern Mexico on Tuesday, traveling in two groups aiming to reach the US border.</p>

<p>Over the past week migrants have launched two caravans - large groups of people walking together - bound for the United States. In the past such caravans have stirred intense debate in the United States, where immigration is likely to be a key topic ahead of the Nov. 5 presidential election.</p>

<p>"Whoever is (in charge of the US government), we will continue the fight to be there," said Leivi Galvna, a migrant from Honduras. "We have to fight for our dream."</p>

<p>As they walked, the group shouted phrases like "yes we can," while pushing worn-out strollers.</p>

<p>In recent years, caravans have been a means for tens of thousands of migrants to cross Mexico, often as a safety measure amid reports that robberies, rapes and kidnappings of migrants are common.</p>

<p>The caravans are often a lifeline for those who cannot afford to pay a smuggler or human trafficker for a "safer" journey.</p>

<p>"I travel more safely in a caravan, I don't want to be killed in Mexico," said Yoisy, a Venezuelan migrant who was tired of waiting for an appointment through the US Customs and Border Protection CBP One platform to apply for asylum.</p>

<p>The Security Ministry in Chiapas, Mexico's southernmost state, bordering Guatemala, told Reuters there were between 2,500 and 3,000 people in the caravan and most were Venezuelans.</p>

<p>Another local government source said there had been a significant increase in the number of children in recent caravans.</p>

<p>In June, when the Biden administration early in the month implemented a policy prohibiting migrants caught crossing the US-Mexico border illegally from applying for asylum, the daily average of arrests ranged between 2,500 and 3,000 migrants per day for a week, a huge decline from prior months.</p>

<p>But thousands of migrants continue to take a shot at seeking asylum in the United States with the hope of leaving behind insecurity, poverty and other problems in their home countries.</p>

<p>Jose Maria Garcia, director of the Juventud 2000 migrant shelter in Tijuana, said he did not know to which border town the caravans were headed, but said the uncertain outcome of the upcoming US elections could be a motivating catalyst.</p>

<p>"The migrant community is very confused," he said, of how migrants view the future of US immigration policy.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An explosion at a factory producing Jose Cuervo tequila in Mexico killed five people Tuesday, local authorities said.</p>

<p>"So far the deaths of five people are confirmed, workers of the company," the civil protection unit in the western state of Jalisco said in a statement.</p>

<p>Two others were injured, one seriously, the statement added.</p>

<p>It was not yet known what caused the blast in Tequila municipality, with the company saying it happened during maintenance work.</p>

<p>It impacted four containers with a capacity of 219,000 litres each, two of which collapsed, said Victor Hugo Roldan, state director of civil protection.</p>

<p>"The Jalisco Institute of Forensic Sciences is already here to do their expert report," he told journalists.</p>

<p>Footage from a municipal security camera shows one of the containers flying meters into the air after the explosion, which caused a fire that was brought under control hours later.</p>

<p>The incident occurred at around 4:30 pm (2230 GMT) at the distillery, known as La Rojena.</p>

<p>Fifty firefighters attended the scene, in addition to the firm's internal civil protection team, the authorities said.</p>

<p>Those living near the factory were evacuated temporarily, returning to their homes after a few hours, while the electricity supply was briefly cut as a safety measure.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An Australian woman was allegedly gang-raped by five men in Paris just days before the city is set to host the opening ceremonies of the 2024 Olympic Games. According to France's Le Parisien newspaper, the "disoriented" 25-year-old woman entered a local restaurant on the famed Boulevard de Clichy in Paris' Pigalle neighbourhood on Saturday, wearing her dress backwards. Authorities in Paris confirmed that a "gang-rape" likely took place between Friday and Saturday, and an investigation is currently underway.</p>

<p>Local media reported that the woman took refuge in a kebab shop in the Pigalle district with her dress partially torn off. Restaurant owners called for help upon seeing her state, and she was attended to by firefighters before being taken to Bichat Hospital for a medical examination.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The timing of this incident is particularly troubling as security officials are already grappling with a multitude of potential threats, including terrorist attacks, cyberattacks, crowd crushes, and the impact of potential labour strikes during the Olympics.</p>

<p>Strath Gordon, Chief of Public Affairs and Communication for Australia's Olympic team, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/07/23/paris-attack-olympics-australia/">stated </a>that Australian athletes in Paris had been informed of the alleged attack. "They are advised not to wear team kit when in public places," Mr Gordon said in an email on Tuesday. He emphasized that the athletes had not received any threats since their arrival in France and were "getting on with their preparations for the Games."</p>

<p>The Australian consulate and French police are providing support to the victim. Anna Meares, the Australian chef de mission, expressed her shock and concern over the incident. "I have been informed, it sounds horrific. Obviously, our hearts go out to the woman involved, and we hope she's being cared for and supported in the trauma she's experienced," <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/article/2024/jul/23/olympic-officials-briefed-after-australian-woman-allegedly-raped-by-five-men-in-paris">Ms Meares said on Tuesday morning.</a></p>

<p>Ms Meares reiterated that team members had been thoroughly briefed on security and safety precautions. "What information we're passing on to our athletes is that security presence is really, really high and that's in order for them to act as quickly as possible to keep them safe," <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/jul/24/significant-assault-two-staff-from-nines-olympic-broadcast-team-attacked-in-paris-in-suspected-robbery">she said</a>. "We don't yet have any feedback from our athletes that they have felt unsafe. We are encouraging them, if they go out of the village, not to go out on their own, not to wear team uniform, just to wear plain clothes."</p>

<p>The Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is working to confirm the details of the incident. "The Australian embassy in Paris is making urgent inquiries with French authorities following reports of an Australian citizen assaulted in Paris," a spokesperson stated.</p>

<p>In June, the alleged rape of a 12-year-old Jewish girl in a suburb of Paris triggered protests and sparked condemnations from politicians, who linked the crime to rampant antisemitism in France.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

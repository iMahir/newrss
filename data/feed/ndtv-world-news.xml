       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is no link between mobile phone use and increased brain cancer risk, according to a new World Health Organization-commissioned review of the available published evidence worldwide.</p>

<p>Despite the huge rise in the use of wireless technology, there has not been a corresponding rise in the incidence of brain cancers, the review, published on Tuesday, found. That applies even to people who make long phone calls or those who have used mobile phones for more than a decade.</p>

<p>The final analysis included 63 studies from 1994-2022, assessed by 11 investigators from 10 countries, including the Australian government's radiation protection authority.</p>

<p>The work assessed the effects of radiofrequency, used in mobile phones as well as TV, baby monitors and radar, co-author Mark Elwood, professor of cancer epidemiology at the University of Auckland, New Zealand, said.</p>

<p>"None of the major questions studied showed increased risks," he said. The review looked at cancers of the brain in adults and children, as well as cancer of the pituitary gland, salivary glands and leukemias, and risks linked to mobile phone use, base stations, or transmitters, as well as occupational exposure. Other cancer types will be reported separately.</p>

<p>The review follows other similar work. The WHO and other international health bodies have said previously there is no definitive evidence of adverse health effects from the radiation used by mobile phones, but called for more research. It is currently classified as "possibly carcinogenic", or class 2B, by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), a category used when the agency cannot rule out a potential link.</p>

<p>The agency's advisory group has called for the classification to be re-evaluated as soon as possible given the new data since its last assessment in 2011.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Deadly Listeria outbreak linked to deli meats, first reported in July, has resulted in at least 57 hospitalizations and nine deaths across 18 US states, according to the CDC.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Deadly listeria outbreak in deli meats, which was first reported in July and, as of Tuesday, has been linked to several hospitalisations across many US states, could bring more illness, according to the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>

<p>The outbreak has led to at least 57 hospitalisations and nine deaths in 18 states since the CDC initially reported it on July 19. Those cases now include nine deaths across South Carolina, Illinois, New Jersey, Virginia, Florida, Tennessee, New Mexico, and New York.</p>

<p>The<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2024/s0828-listeria-outbreak-deli-meats.html"> national public health agency</a> of the United States has confirmed that this is the largest listeriosis outbreak since the 2011 outbreak linked to cantaloupe.</p>

<p>The agency has urged citizens to exercise extreme caution regarding the outbreak, saying, "Everyone should check their homes for any remaining recalled Boar's Head products since they can have a long shelf life." Look for "EST. 12612" or "P-12612" inside the USDA mark of inspection on the product labels. Some of the products have sold by dates into October 2024."</p>

<p><strong>Listeria infection: Symptoms, source</strong></p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2024/s0828-listeria-outbreak-deli-meats.html">CDC,</a> Listeria is a hardy germ that can remain on surfaces, like meat slicers, and foods, even at refrigerated temperatures. It can also take up to 10 weeks for some people to have symptoms of listeriosis.</p>

<p>Listeria can cause severe illness (known as invasive listeriosis) when the bacteria spread beyond the gut to other parts of the body.</p>

<p>Pregnant people typically experience only fever, fatigue, and muscle aches. However, Listeria infection during pregnancy can lead to miscarriage, stillbirth, premature delivery, or life-threating infection of the newborn.</p>

<p>People who are not pregnant may experience headaches, stiff necks, confusion, loss of balance, and convulsions, in addition to fever and muscle aches.</p>

<p>Symptoms of severe illness usually start 1 to 4 weeks after eating contaminated food with Listeria but may start as early as the same day or as late as 70 days after.</p>

<p><strong>Prevention:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Do not eat recalled deli products. Throw them away or contact stores about returns.</li>
	<li>People who are at higher risk for getting sick with Listeria, such as those who are pregnant, are aged 65 or older, or have a weakened immune system, should always avoid eating meats sliced at deli counters, unless heated to an internal temperature of 165°F or until steaming hot just before serving.</li>
	<li>Clean your refrigerator, containers, and surfaces that may have touched sliced deli meats.</li>
	<li>Call your healthcare provider if you have symptoms of Listeria and recently ate meat sliced at deli counters.</li>
	<li>Businesses that received recalled meats should take extra precautions like cleaning and sanitising and throwing away opened sliced meats and cheeses at delis. Businesses should also follow USDA-FSIS best practices for controlling Listeria contamination in deli areas.</li>
</ul>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi received a warm welcome by the members of the Indian community in Brunei Darussalam today.</p>

<p>The PM arrived in Brunei Darussalam this afternoon at the invitation of Sultan Haji Hassanal Bolkiah, for the first-ever bilateral trip by an Indian PM to the southeast Asian nation.</p>

<p>Upon his arrival, PM Modi was received by Crown Prince Haji Al-Muhtadee Billah at the Bandar Seri Begawan Airport and was given a ceremonial welcome.</p>

<p>After the guard of honour, the PM was welcomed by members of the Indian community who had come to see him. During his interactions, PM Modi could be seen signing a drawing of him made by a child as onlookers cheered the moment.</p>

<p>During the visit, the Prime Minister will engage in bilateral discussions that focus on multiple areas such as defence, trade and investment, energy, space technology, health, culture and people-to-people exchanges.</p>

<p>"This visit is special as it is the first ever bilateral visit by an Indian PM and is taking place as the two countries are celebrating 40 years of the establishment of diplomatic ties this year," Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said in a post on X.</p>

<p>The trip is part of a three-day bilateral visit to Brunei and Singapore. According to the MEA, the government of Brunei has been supportive of India's 'Look East' and 'Act East' policies for deepening cooperation with ASEAN.</p>

<p>"Brunei is an important partner for India's Act East Policy and our vision for the Indo-Pacific, and as we mark a decade of our 'Act East' Policy this year, the visit assumes additional significance. Brunei has been our country coordinator in ASEAN from 2012 to 2015 and played a key role in our further engagements with ASEAN and continues to do so today," MEA Secretary (East) Jaideep Mazumdar told news agency IANS.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Larry the Downing Street cat is facing a challenge to his position as the British government's chief mouser -- a cute "Russian" kitten.</p>

<p>New prime minister Keir Starmer and his family, who moved into Number 10 after the Labour leader's thumping general election win in July, brought their family cat JoJo with them.</p>

<p>Now after "negotiations" with the Starmer children -- who had wanted a German Shepherd dog -- it has been agreed that Jojo will also be joined by a "Siberian kitten".</p>

<p>"There's been a long summer of negotiations, back and forth, different options," Starmer told BBC radio in an interview broadcast on Monday.</p>

<p>"But now we've gone for... a kitten instead of a dog," he added.</p>

<p>But Larry has been top cat at the British prime ministerial residence in central London for the last 13 years.</p>

<p>The 17-year-old tabby was adopted from a cat rescue charity in 2011 to keep the Downing Street mice at bay, although then premier David Cameron revealed his performance left something to be desired.</p>

<p>Despite that, Larry has become a media star -- particularly popular with journalists -- and even has his own social media account @Number10cat.</p>

<p>Starmer -- Larry's sixth prime minister -- revealed that feline rivalry was not the only issue with having pets in Downing Street.</p>

<p>"The problem we've got, which is the same for JoJo the cat, is that the only door out of our new flat is bomb proof," he said.</p>

<p>"Therefore, getting a cat flap is proving a little bit difficult," he added.</p>

<p><strong>- 'Larry Bridges' -</strong></p>

<p>Given Larry's celebrity status as the greatest survivor of the political upheaval of recent years, officials have even drawn up a detailed plan in the event of his death.</p>

<p>Like that for the late Queen Elizabeth II, which was codenamed "London Bridge", Larry's plan has been dubbed "Larry Bridges".</p>

<p>The arrival of the Starmers' new pet was welcomed by Sarah Elliott, central veterinary officer for the charity Cats Protection.</p>

<p>But she added a few words of advice for the Starmers as they try to integrate the new addition.</p>

<p>"As the junior member of the growing cat coalition at Downing Street, the prime minister and his family will need to take plenty of time to slowly introduce the new addition to JoJo and Larry.</p>

<p>And she added: "Young kittens can be exhausting for older statesmen like Larry, so he'll also need a safe, quiet area to retreat to when the energy of a younger member of the team gets a bit too much," she added.</p>

<p>Larry himself on Tuesday made it clear he was very still very much in charge.</p>

<p>"The kitten will REPORT to Larry the Cat," he said on X, via the human running his social media account.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Tuesday that the British government made a "shameful decision" when it suspended some arms export licences to Israel.</p>

<p>Britain's foreign minister David Lammy said on Monday that the government had suspended 30 of 350 arms export licences with Israel due to a risk the equipment could be used to commit serious violations of international humanitarian law.</p>

<p>The decision, which came a day after Israeli forces recovered the bodies of six hostages from a tunnel in Gaza, was quickly denounced by a number of Israeli ministers.</p>

<p>"This shameful decision will not change Israel's determination to defeat Hamas, a genocidal terrorist organization that savagely murdered 1,200 people on October 7, including 14 British citizens," Netanyahu said in a social media post.</p>

<p>"Hamas is still holding over 100 hostages, including 5 British citizens. Instead of standing with Israel, a fellow democracy defending itself against barbarism, Britain's misguided decision will only embolden Hamas," Netanyahu said.</p>

<p>"With or without British arms, Israel will win this war and secure our common future."</p>

<p>Soon after Britain's Labour Party won an election in July, Lammy said he would update a review on arms sales to ally Israel to ensure these complied with international law.</p>

<p>British exports amount to less than 1% of the total arms Israel receives, and the minister said the suspension would not have a material impact on Israel's security and Britain continued to support its right to self-defence.</p>

<p>Both Israeli and Palestinian leaders are being investigated for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity in the wake of the Oct. 7 attacks by Hamas in southern Israel which killed 1,200 people, by Israeli tallies.</p>

<p>The Israeli response in Gaza has killed more than 40,700 people, according to Palestinian health authorities.</p>

<p>Lammy said Monday's decision was not a judgment on whether Israel had breached international law or not. Israel and Palestinian leaders have dismissed allegations of war crimes.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The woman, from East Cornwall, received a 17-year prison sentence, while the man, from North Cornwall, was sentenced to 13 years.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A woman and her partner from Cornwall have been sentenced to prison for plotting to drug and rape her six-year-old daughter. The couple, whose identities are being withheld to protect the victim, were sentenced at Plymouth Crown Court on Friday, August 30.</p>

<p>The woman, from East Cornwall, received a 17-year prison sentence, while the man, from North Cornwall, was sentenced to 13 years. Both were also given a 20-year Sexual Harm Prevention Order, reported <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.itv.com/news/westcountry/2024-09-03/mum-and-partner-planned-to-drug-and-rape-her-daughter-6" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>ITV News</em></a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The investigation began in 2021 when the man accidentally left his phone with someone at a pub, who then discovered disturbing messages related to the sexual abuse of a young girl. Police seized the phone as evidence and subsequently arrested both individuals.</p>

<p>Detectives uncovered text messages revealing that the woman had planned to drug her six-year-old daughter to allow the man to rape her. They also found sexually explicit images of the child, which the woman had taken and sent to him.</p>

<p>The woman faced five charges and pleaded not guilty to all. However, at a trial held at Truro Crown Court in May 2024, she was found unanimously guilty by the jury and sentenced to 17 years for the following offences:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Conspiracy to rape a child under 13</li>
	<li>Conspiracy to assault by penetration of a child under 13</li>
	<li>Administering a substance with intent to stupefy to allow sexual activity</li>
	<li>Distributing indecent images of a child</li>
	<li>Possession of indecent images of a child</li>
</ul>

<p>The man pleaded guilty to charges of conspiracy to rape a child under 13 and possessing indecent images of a child. He was sentenced to 13 years in prison.</p>

<p>Detective Inspector Sara Ward, the Senior Investigating Officer, said, "This is an extremely harrowing case, and we welcome the sentences handed down by the judge today. I want to thank everyone who supported the police investigation through what has been a long and challenging process due to the nature of these crimes. My sincere thanks also go to the investigation team, who have acted with the utmost professionalism and commitment in bringing these offenders to justice for their depraved acts. The young victim was betrayed by the person who should have been protecting her. All of our thoughts remain with the victim."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At least 41 people have been killed and more than 180 injured in Ukraine's Poltava after two Russian ballistic missiles hit a military education facility today.</p>

<p>Two Russian ballistic missiles hit a hospital and an educational institution, partially destroying one of the institute's buildings, Ukraine's Ministry of Defence said.</p>

<p>"The time interval between the alarm and the arrival of the deadly missiles was so short that it caught people in the middle of evacuating to the bomb shelter," the Ukraine's Defence Ministry added.</p>

<p>Writing on social media website X, President Zelenskyy said, "I received preliminary reports on the Russian strike in Poltava. According to available information, two ballistic missiles hit the area. They targeted an educational institution and a nearby hospital, partially destroying one of the telecommunications institute's buildings."</p>

<p>He went on to write that many are feared trapped in the debris. While 41 people were killed, more than 180 others were injured in the attack. He also said that search and rescue operation are being carried out and several people have been rescued as well.</p>

<p>President Zelenskyy also posted a video message for all Ukrainians.</p>

<p>"People were trapped under the rubble. Many people were rescued, but more than 180 were injured. Unfortunately, there are many casualties. As of now, we know that 41 people were killed. My deepest condolences to all of their relatives and loved ones," President Zelenskyy wrote.</p>

<p>The Ukrainian President has ordered a full-scale investigation into the attack and its circumstances. He confirmed that "All necessary services are involved in the rescue operations." He also thanked the people who helped immediately after the attack. "I am grateful to everyone who has been helping and saving lives from the very first moments following the strike," he wrote.</p>

<p>President Zelenskyy vowed that Russia will "surely pay for this strike".</p>

<p>Calling it a "terror attack", Me Zelenskyy wrote, "We continue to urge everyone in the world who has the power to stop this terror: Ukraine needs air defense systems and missiles now, not sitting in storage. Long-range strikes that can protect us from Russian terror are needed now, not later. Every day of delay, unfortunately, means more lost lives."<br />

       <description><![CDATA[A recent study suggests that earthquakes may significantly contribute to the formation of gold nuggets within quartz veins through a process known as piezoelectricity.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gold has long been valued both for its rarity and aesthetic appeal, serving not only as a medium of exchange or a piece of jewellery but also as a catalyst in chemical reactions and an electrical conductor in modern technology. It is usually found as gold nuggets in quartz veins, crystallised silicon dioxide, and its formation process has been debated by scientists for many years.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, the recent research entitled <em>"Gold nugget formation from earthquake-induced piezoelectricity in quartz,"</em> which was published in <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-024-01514-1"><em>Nature Geoscience,</em></a> suggests that earthquakes may play a significant role in creating these valuable nuggets.</p>

<p>"The standard explanation is that gold precipitates from hot, water-rich fluids as they flow through cracks in the Earth's crust," <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scimex.org/newsfeed/electricity-generated-by-earthquakes-might-be-the-secret-behind-giant-gold-nuggets">said Dr Chris Voisey</a>, the lead author of the study.</p>

<p>"As these fluids cool or undergo chemical changes, gold separates out and becomes trapped in quartz veins," he said.</p>

<p>Despite its widespread acceptance, this theory falls short in explaining the formation of large gold nuggets, particularly given the extremely low concentration of gold in these fluids.</p>

<p>"The stressed quartz not only electrochemically deposited gold onto its surface, but it also formed and accumulated gold nanoparticles," &nbsp;<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scimex.org/newsfeed/electricity-generated-by-earthquakes-might-be-the-secret-behind-giant-gold-nuggets">said study co-author Professor Andy Tomkins</a>, from the Monash University School of Earth, Atmosphere and Environment..</p>

<p>"Remarkably, the gold had a tendency to deposit on existing gold grains rather than forming new ones."</p>

<p>This is because, while quartz is an electrical insulator, gold is a conductor.</p>

<p>Once some gold is deposited, it becomes a focal point for further growth, effectively "plating" the gold grains with more gold.</p>

<p>"Our discovery provides a plausible explanation for the formation of large gold nuggets in quartz veins," said Dr Voisey.</p>

<p>These findings open up new avenues of possibility in understanding the formation of gold nuggets, showing probable linkage between seismic activities and generation of these precious metals within quartz veins. This might cast a new light on the geological processes that generate one of the world's most treasured materials.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi arrived at the Bandar Seri Begawan Airport this afternoon as he began a two-day visit to Brunei Darussalam - the first ever bilateral trip by an Indian PM to the southeast Asian nation - at the invitation of Sultan Haji Hassanal Bolkiah.</p>

<p>"As we celebrate the 40 years of our diplomatic relations, I look forward to my meetings with His Majesty Sultan Haji Hassanal Bolkiah and other esteemed members of the Royal family to advance our historical relationship to new heights," said PM Modi in his departure statement ahead of his visit to Brunei Darussalam and Singapore.</p>

<p>During his visit, the Prime Minister will engage in bilateral discussions focusing on exploring new areas for cooperation in multiple areas like defence, trade and investment, energy, space technology, health, capacity building, culture and vibrant people-to-people exchanges.</p>

<p>Last month, External Affairs Minister (EAM) S Jaishankar had met Erywan Pehin Yusof, Foreign Minister of Brunei on the sidelines of ASEAN meetings in Vientiane and jointly launched the logo celebrating 40 years of diplomatic relations between the two countries.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Brunei Sultan met for the first time on the sidelines of 25th ASEAN Summit at Nay Pyi Taw in November 2014. They met once again during the 2017 East Asia Summit held in Manila.</p>

<p>In January 2018, the Brunei Sultan, along with the 10 ASEAN Heads of State and Government, visited India for the ASEAN-India Commemorative Summit. The leaders were also 'Guests of Honour' at India's 69th Republic Day celebrations on January 26, 2018.</p>

<p>In 2013, then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh visited Brunei Darussalam to participate in the 11th ASEAN-India Summit and the 8th EAS Summit.</p>

<p>Crowned as the 29th Sultan and Yang Di-Pertuan of Brunei Darussalam in August 1968, Sultan Haji Hassanal Bolkiah undertook his first State Visit to India in September, 1992. His second State Visit to India came in May, 2008.</p>

<p>According to the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA), Brunei Darussalam government has been supportive of India's 'Look East' and 'Act East' policies for expansion and deepening of cooperation with ASEAN.</p>

<p>"Brunei is an important partner for India's Act East Policy and our vision for the Indo-Pacific, and as we mark a decade of our 'Act East' Policy this year, the visit assumes additional significance. Brunei has been our country coordinator in ASEAN from 2012 to 2015 and played a key role in our further engagements with ASEAN and continues to do so today," Jaideep Mazumdar, MEA Secretary (East), said ahead of the PM's landmark visit.</p>

<p>Indian naval and coast guard ships have also regularly visited Brunei and two Indian defence companies - Bharat Electronics Ltd and MKU Limited - participated in the Defence Industry Exposition organised by Brunei Armed Forces in June 2024 for the first time. Sultan Haji Hassanal Bolkiah and Crown Prince Al-Muhtadee Billah visited the Indian stalls during the expo and appreciated the Indian companies' participation.</p>

<p>There are currently around 14,500 Indians living in Brunei Darussalam out of the total population of about 450,500 with more than half of the Indian expatriates being semi and unskilled workers, who work in oil and gas industries construction, retail businesses, etc. There is also a substantial number of Indian doctors and teachers working in Brunei.</p>

<p>After Brunei, PM Modi will travel to Singapore - a country with which India is exploring enhanced cooperation in digital, skill development, sustainability, healthcare, connectivity and advanced manufacturing areas.</p>

<p>In his departure statement on Tuesday, PM Modi said that he is looking forward to meeting Singapore President Tharman Shanmugaratnam, Prime Minister Lawrence Wong, Senior Minister Lee Hsien Loong and Emeritus Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong besides the leaders of Singapore's vibrant business community.</p>

<p>"I look forward to my discussions to deepen our Strategic Partnership with Singapore, particularly in new and emerging areas of advanced manufacturing, digitalization, and sustainable development. Both countries are important partners in our Act East Policy and the Indo-Pacific Vision. I am confident that my visits would further strengthen our partnership with Brunei, Singapore and the larger ASEAN region," said Prime Minister Modi.</p>

<p>Last week, External Affairs Minister (EAM) S Jaishankar, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal and Railways Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw led the Indian delegation at the second India-Singapore Ministerial Roundtable (ISMR) held in Singapore on Monday.</p>

<p>During their visit, the Indian ministerial delegation also jointly called on Singapore Prime Minister and Minister for Finance Lawrence Wong who had led the Singapore delegation for the first ISMR held in New Delhi in September 2022.</p>

<p>"Glad that progress has been made on several fronts since our last meeting. And new ideas for cooperation are being pursued, including in advanced manufacturing and connectivity. These initiatives will pave the way for closer strategic cooperation and partnership between India and Singapore," the Singapore PM said after his meeting with the visiting Indian ministers on Monday.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Humanity's fascination with gold stretches back thousands of years. Gold mining is described in ancient Greek and Roman sources, and gold rushes – especially in the 19th century – played a powerful role in shaping the modern world.</p>

<p>The dense, yellow metal is often found in the veins of the rocky mineral quartz. This is because the two condense together from hot fluids underground as a result of changes in temperature, pressure and chemistry.</p>

<p>Geologists understand this process quite well, but large gold nuggets have been a bit of a mystery. Gold is only dissolved in natural fluids at around one part per million, so how does it concentrate into lumps that weigh tens or even hundreds of kilograms?</p>

<p>As we report today in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-024-01514-1">Nature Geoscience</a>, the answer likely has to do with the unusual electrical properties of quartz – and what happens when an earthquake puts it under pressure.</p>

<h3><strong>Quartz under pressure</strong></h3>

<p>Quartz is what is called a piezoelectric material. There aren't many minerals like this on Earth, and quartz is by far the most abundant.</p>

<p>Piezoelectric materials generate an instantaneous electric charge when put under stress – when there is a physical force compressing or stretching them. The bigger the force, the bigger the charge.</p>

<p>Not only did we see gold deposited onto the quartz surface, we also saw it clumping together into nanoparticles. What's more, once the process began, gold was more likely to be deposited onto existing grains of gold than on quartz.</p>

<p>This actually makes a lot of sense, as quartz is an electrical insulator and gold conducts electricity. The existing gold grains adopt the electric potential from the nearby quartz and become the focus of reactions that deposit gold.</p>

<p>Industrial gold-plating works in much the same way, only here we are gold-plating other gold.</p>

<h3><strong>Back to nuggets</strong></h3>

<p>Now we know how quartz and gold behave this way in the lab, we can think about geology again.</p>

<p>Some of the most impressive gold nuggets ever found have been in quartz veins where gold-bearing fluids flow through faults in earthquake-prone rock.</p>

<p>During seismic activity, the stress on quartz can generate piezoelectric voltages capable of drawing gold from these fluids. Once deposited, gold becomes the focus of further piezoelectric plating as fluid infiltration continues – so the gold deposits grow bigger over time.</p>

<p>Over millions and millions of years, this process will be repeated again and again. Is this the reason we see such large gold nuggets in this kind of quartz vein? We think it must be at least part of the picture.<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Record-breaking temperatures and prolonged drought in Greece have exposed a sunken village in Athens' main reservoir for the first time in 30 years.</p>

<p>The village of Kallio was submerged in the late 1970s when the Mornos dam was built 200 kilometres (124 miles) west of the capital, the artificial lake fed by the Mornos and Evinos rivers.</p>

<p>With lake levels down by 30 percent in recent months according to state water operator EYDAP, the ruins of a school and houses have reappeared.</p>

<p>"The level of Lake Mornos has dropped by 40 metres (131 feet)," said Yorgos Iosifidis, a 60-year-old pensioner who had to leave his home as a young man along with the other villagers when the area was flooded.</p>

<p>"You see the first floor that remains of my father-in-law's two-storey house... and next to it you can see what's left of my cousins' house," Iosifidis, who now lives higher up the hill, told AFP.</p>

<p>Drought worsened this year in the Mediterranean country that is well accustomed to summer heat waves.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After the mildest winter on record, Greece had its hottest July on record, according to preliminary weather data from the National Observatory. This came after similarly record-breaking temperatures in June.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Nearly 80 houses in Kallio, in addition to the church and school, were "sacrificed" to supply Athens with water, Kallio village chairman Apostolis Gerodimos told state agency ANA.</p>

<p>This is the second time Kallio has reappeared, after another period of drought in the early 1990s, said Iosifidis.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"If it doesn't rain soon, the level will drop further and the problem will be more acute than it was then," he said.</p>

<p>Anastasis Papageorgiou, 26, a doctor who lives in Amygdalia, a village near Mornos, said the area has seen very little rain or snow in the last two years.</p>

<p>"The situation is difficult at the moment, so we have to be careful with water," he said.</p>

<p>The Greek authorities called on the 3.7 million inhabitants of Attica, the region surrounding Athens and home to a third of the Greek population, not to waste water.&nbsp;</p>

<p>EYDAP has also tapped into additional reservoirs near the capital.</p>

<p>On a visit to neighbouring Thessaly on Monday to discuss reconstruction works after last year's destructive floods, Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said Greece had to improve its water management.</p>

<p>"We don't have the luxury to wastewater... at a time when we know with certainty that we will have less water, we must protect water resources more methodically than we have done so far," Mitsotakis said.</p>

<p>Greece uses 85 per cent of its water for irrigation and needs to build more dams, the prime minister said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi is currently on a visit to Brunei and Singapore to strengthen India's bilateral ties with Southeast Asian nations. His first stop is Brunei, where he will spend two days and meet Sultan Haji Hassanal Bolkiah. The Brunei visit is the first-ever by an Indian Prime Minister.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/pm-narendra-modi-to-meet-with-the-sultan-of-brunei-who-boasts-world-s-largest-car-collection-worth-5b-6478680#pfrom=home-ndtv_topstories" target="_blank">Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah</a>, the second-longest reigning monarch in the world after the late Queen Elizabeth II, will host the Indian PM. He is renowned for his extravagant lifestyle and vast wealth. With an estimated net worth of around $30 billion, he was once recognised as the world's richest person.<br />
<br />
His primary home, the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/pm-narendra-modi-to-meet-brunei-sultan-at-istana-nurul-iman-the-worlds-largest-palace-6478971#pfrom=home-ndtv_topstories" target="_blank">Istana Nurul Iman Palace</a>, is the world's largest residential palace according to the Guinness Book of World Records. Covering over 2,00,000 square metres, the palace has 1,700 rooms, 257 bathrooms, and five swimming pools. The palace was completed in 1984 for $1.4 billion. It also features 110 garages.<br />
<br />
Hassanal Bolkiah is also known for his impressive car collection. He owns over 7,000 vehicles, including 600 Rolls-Royces, 450 Ferraris and 380 Bentleys. His collection includes rare and custom-made vehicles such as a gold-coated Rolls-Royce and a Ferrari 456 GT Venice, one of only seven in the world. This collection is valued at over $5 billion.<br />
<br />
His private aviation fleet is equally remarkable. The Sultan owns a Boeing 747-400, a Boeing 767-200, and an Airbus A340-200. His Boeing 747-400, known as the “flying palace,” is lavishly decorated with gold and Lalique crystal. The aircraft is said to have cost around $400 million.<br />
<br />
His art collection includes significant pieces like Pierre-Auguste Renoir's 1892 masterpiece ‘Young Girls At The Piano', which he purchased for $70 million.<br />
<br />
Known for his extravagant personal indulgences, Hassanal Bolkiah reportedly spends up to $20,000 per haircut. He flies his favourite barber from London to Brunei for grooming sessions.<br />
<br />
He graduated from the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, the same institution attended by British Royals Princes William and Harry.<br />
<br />
Beyond his lavish lifestyle, he has also been involved in various charitable activities and governance reforms.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A cold case that baffled authorities and intrigued locals for nearly half a century has finally come to a close. The mystery surrounding the frozen body found in a Pennsylvania cave in 1977, known for decades only as "Pinnacle Man," is over. The remains have been identified as those of Nicholas Paul Grubb, a 27-year-old man from Fort Washington, Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>The long-awaited breakthrough was announced by the Berks County Coroner's Office at a press conference on Tuesday, reported CNN. The key to unlocking this cold case was some good old-fashioned detective work. &nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>The discovery</strong></h3>

<p>On a chilly day in January 1977, hikers exploring a cave near the Pinnacle, a peak in the Appalachian Mountains in Albany Township, stumbled upon a grisly discovery. The frozen body of a man was found inside the cave, triggering an investigation that would last decades.</p>

<p>The initial investigation, led by George Holmes, then the chief deputy coroner of Berks County, hit a dead end quickly. The man, unable to be identified based on his appearance, clothing, or belongings, became a mystery known simply as the "Pinnacle Man."&nbsp;</p>

<p>An autopsy revealed that the cause of death was a drug-induced overdose, with no signs of trauma or foul play. Dental records and fingerprints were collected, but the fingerprint card soon disappeared, leaving investigators with little to go on.</p>

<h3><strong>A break in the case</strong></h3>

<p>For more than four decades, the Pinnacle Man's true identity remained unknown. Then, in 2019, authorities decided to revisit the cold case, exhuming the body in hopes that advancements in forensic science might finally provide answers.</p>

<p>Berks County forensic experts performed an examination and took DNA samples, which were entered into the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System (NamUs). However, the samples did not match any known cases, and the identity of Pinnacle Man remained a mystery.</p>

<p>Fast-forward to early August of this year, when a Pennsylvania State Police detective, Ian Keck, stumbled upon a crucial piece of evidence that had been missing for decades - the lost fingerprint card from Grubb's 1977 autopsy.</p>

<p>Recognising its significance, Mr Keck immediately submitted the card to NamUs. Within just an hour, an FBI fingerprint expert confirmed a match - the fingerprints belonged to Nicholas Paul Grubb.</p>

<h3><strong>Closing the book on a 50-year mystery</strong></h3>

<p>With Mr Grubb's identity finally confirmed, Berks County Coroner John Fielding was relieved. "This identification brings a long-awaited resolution to his family, who have been notified and expressed their deep appreciation for the collective efforts that made it possible," Mr Fielding said during a press conference. "It is moments like these that remind us of the importance of our work, to provide answers, to bring closure, and to give the unidentified a name and a story."</p>

<p>One of Mr Grubb's relatives, who was informed of the discovery, requested that his remains be placed in the family plot, finally bringing him home after all these years.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister of Israel Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday sought forgiveness for not being able to save the lives of six Iseraeli hostages, whose bodies were found in a tunnel in Gaza.</p>

<p>The Israel's military had on Saturday said they recovered the bodies of six hostages "from an underground tunnel in the Rafah area" in southern Gaza.</p>

<p>The bodies were identified as that of Carmel Gat, who was taken from a kibbutz community near the Gaza border, as well as Eden Yerushalmi, Almog Sarusi, Ori Danino, US-Israeli Hersh Goldberg-Polin and Russian-Israeli Alexander Lobanov, who were kidnapped from a music festival site.and held captive by militants.</p>

<p>"I ask for your forgiveness for not bringing them back alive," Prime Minister Netanyahu said at a press conference. "We were close but we didn't succeed. Hamas will pay a very heavy price for this," he said.</p>

<p>Daniel Hagari, a military spokesperson, said all six "were abducted alive on the morning of October 7 and brutally murdered by Hamas terrorists shortly before we reached them".</p>

<p>Speaking to Lobanov's parents on Sunday, Prime Minister Netanyahu had said: "I would like to tell you how much I regret and request forgiveness for not succeeding in bringing Sasha back alive."</p>

<p>The families of Israeli hostages whose bodies were recovered from Gaza sobbed as they laid their relatives to rest on Sunday at funerals that featured heartfelt eulogies alongside expressions of frustration with the government.</p>

<p>Critics in Israel have accused Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of prolonging the war for political gain.</p>

<p>Tens of thousands of Israelis took to the streets across the country on Sunday afternoon and evening.</p>

<p>US President Joe Biden has also said that "It is time this war ended." The United States has been involved in ceasefire mediation efforts along with Qatar and Egypt.</p>

<p>Of 251 people taken hostage during the October 7 attack, 97 remain in Gaza, including 33 the Israeli military says are dead.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At least 129 people were killed during a weekend prison break attempt at the largest jail in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the interior minister said on Tuesday.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The provisional human toll is 129 dead, including 24 who were shot after warnings," minister Jacquemain Shabani said in a video message, adding that at least 59 others had been wounded at the Makala prison in the capital, Kinshasa. &nbsp;</p>

<p>His ministry said several people had been crushed or suffocated and a number of women had been raped.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Witnesses told AFP gunfire had started at the prison at around 2:00 am on Monday morning and lasted for several hours.</p>

<p>Daddi Soso, an electrician in his 40s living in the capital, reported seeing security force vehicles taking bodies away in the early hours.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The authorities did not indicate as to how many inmates had escaped or attempted to do so, but at mid-morning on Monday government spokesman Patrick Muyaya told national television the situation was "under control".&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk has confirmed he wants to work with former President Donald Trump in auditing US agencies to identify programmes for cuts. The billionaire responded to a report by The Washington Post on X, saying, "I can't wait. There is a lot of waste and needless regulation in government that needs to go."&nbsp;</p>

— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1830829538118381574?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 3, 2024</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Ahead of the 2024 Presidential elections, the Republican nominee is set to create a commission to audit US agencies and identify areas for cost-cutting. The proposed commission will include other business leaders such as Fred Smith, former CEO of FedEx, and Robert Nardelli, former CEO of Home Depot, as per the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/09/02/trump-elon-musk-commission-doge/ ">Washington Post</a>.</p>

<p>Mr Musk's interest in such an initiative is not new. Last month, he shared an AI-generated image of himself at a “Department of Government Efficiency” lectern, signalling his desire to contribute to the cause.</p>

<p>Donald Trump has previously acknowledged the Tesla CEO's potential value as a consultant. However, ethics experts are concerned that Mr Musk's involvement may lead to conflicts of interest between his business and the commission's objectives.</p>

<p>Drawing inspiration from past initiatives by Ronald Reagan and Tom Coburn, Trump advisers are seeking to recruit prominent business leaders to identify areas of federal waste. The potential appointment of Mr Musk to a government efficiency commission comes as the Tesla CEO increases his political engagement. Recently, Mr Musk hired a Republican strategist to guide his political activities.</p>

<p>Mr Musk's growing political influence was further highlighted by his recent poll on X, which asked voters to choose between Trump and Kamala Harris as their preferred president. He also sat down with the former president last month for a live interview, which was aired on his platform X. Donald Trump has also publicly praised Mr Musk, calling him "fantastic" and "brilliant.”</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Brazilian supreme court judge ordered Monday the immediate imprisonment of four people convicted for their role in a nightclub fire that killed 242 people more than a decade ago.</p>

<p>The ruling overturned decisions by two lower courts in 2022 and 2023 that annulled the jail sentences, which ranged from 18 to 22 years, over apparent irregularities in the trial.</p>

<p>The four defendants will have one further chance to appeal at Brazil's supreme court, which could ratify or deny Judge Jose Antonio Dias Toffoli's decision, a judiciary representative told AFP.</p>

<p>The 2013 fire at the nightclub in the southern town of Santa Maria started when members of a band playing that night lit flares that set fire to the ceiling.</p>

<p>A police investigation concluded the fire started when sparks from a flare ignited insulating material, releasing lethal fumes.</p>

<p>While some burned to death, many of the mostly young victims died from asphyxiation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A probe found the venue had no functioning fire extinguishers, only two doors for evacuating people from an overcrowded dance floor, and poor emergency signage.</p>

<p>Two owners of the Kiss nightclub and two members of the Gurizada Fandangueira band were found guilty in December 2021 of murder and attempted murder of the victims, mostly young university students.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>South Korea's famous kimchi is falling victim to climate change, with scientists, farmers and manufacturers saying the quality and quantity of the napa cabbage that is pickled to make the ubiquitous dish is suffering due to rising temperatures.</p>

<p>Napa cabbage thrives in cooler climates and is usually planted in mountainous regions where temperatures during the key growing summer season once rarely rose above 25 Celsius (77 Fahrenheit).</p>

<p>Studies show that warmer weather brought about by climate change is now threatening these crops, so much so that South Korea might not be able to grow napa cabbage one day due to the intensifying heat.</p>

<p>"We hope these predictions don't come to pass," plant pathologist and virologist Lee Young-gyu said.</p>

<p>"Cabbage likes to grow in cool climates and adapts to a very narrow band of temperatures," Lee said. "The optimal temperatures are between 18 and 21 Celsius."</p>

<p>In the fields and in kitchens - both commercial and domestic - farmers and kimchi makers are already feeling the change.</p>

<p>Spicy, fermented kimchi is made from other vegetables such as radish, cucumber and green onion, but the most popular dish remains cabbage-based.</p>

<p>Describing the effect of higher temperatures on the vegetable, Lee Ha-yeon, who holds the designation of Kimchi Master from the Agriculture Ministry, said the heart of the cabbage "goes bad, and the root becomes mushy."</p>

<p>"If this continues, then in the summer time we might have to give up cabbage kimchi," said Lee, whose title reflects her contribution to food culture.</p>

<p>Data from the government statistics agency shows the area of highland cabbage farmed last year was less than half of what it was 20 years ago: 3,995 hectares compared to 8,796 hectares.</p>

<p>According to the Rural Development Administration, a state farming think tank, climate change scenarios project the farmed area to shrink dramatically in the next 25 years to just 44 hectares, with no cabbage grown in the highlands by 2090.</p>

<p>Researchers cite higher temperatures, unpredictable heavy rains and pests that become more difficult to control in the warmer and longer summers as the cause for the crop shrinkage.</p>

<p>A fungal infection that wilts the plant has also been particularly troublesome for farmers because it only becomes apparent very close to harvest.</p>

<p>Climate change adds to the challenges facing South Korea's kimchi industry, which is already battling lower-priced imports from China, which are mostly served in restaurants.</p>

<p>Customs data released on Monday showed kimchi imports through the end of July were up 6.9% at $98.5 million this year, almost all of it from China and the highest ever for the period.</p>

<p>So far, the government has relied on massive climate-controlled storage to prevent price spikes and shortages. Scientists are also racing to develop crop varieties that can grow in warmer climates and that are more resilient to large fluctuations in rainfall and infections.</p>

<p>But farmers like Kim Si-gap, 71, who has worked in the cabbage fields of the eastern region of Gangneung all his life, fear these varieties will be more expensive to grow in addition to not tasting quite right.</p>

<p>"When we see the reports that there will come a time in Korea when we can no longer grow cabbage, it was shocking on the one hand and also sad at the same time," Kim said.</p>

<p>"Kimchi is something we cannot not have on the table. What are we going to do if this happens?"</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is offering a reward of up to USD 25,000 for information leading to the arrest and conviction of Cindy Rodriguez Singh, wanted for allegedly killing her young son.</p>

<p>Notably, Rodriguez Singh has ties to India and Mexico. She is wanted for allegedly killing her 6-year-old son, who hasn't been seen alive since October 2022.</p>

<p>At the request of the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services, Everman Police Department officers conducted a welfare check on behalf of the boy on March 20, 2023.</p>

<p>During the welfare check interview, Rodriguez Singh lied to officers when she explained that the boy was living with his biological father in Mexico, and had been there since November 2022, according to the official website of the FBI.</p>

<p>On March 22, 2023, Rodriguez Singh, her husband, and six other juvenile children boarded an international flight bound for India. It was determined that the missing child was not present, and did not board the flight.</p>

<p>On October 31, 2023, Cindy Rodriguez Singh was charged with capital murder in District Court of Tarrant County, Fort Worth, Texas. On November 2, 2023, a federal arrest warrant was issued for Rodriguez Singh in the United States District Court, Northern District of Texas, Fort Worth, Texas, after she was charged with Unlawful Flight to Avoid Prosecution.</p>

<p>In making the announcement, Dallas FBI Special Agent in Charge Chad Yarbrough asked the media and public to help locate Rodriguez Singh.</p>

<p>"Cindy Rodriguez Singh is wanted for allegedly murdering her own young son," Yarbrough said. "I am confident that the combination of publicity, significant reward offering, and the team of experienced investigators assembled by the FBI Fort Worth Resident Agency violent crime squad, Everman Police Department, Tarrant County District Attorney's Office and Texas DPS-Texas Rangers will lead to her arrest."</p>

<p>The FBI on its official website further said that Rodriguez Singh's last confirmed sighting was on March 22, 2023, as she, her husband, and six juvenile children, boarded an international flight to India. She was born in Dallas, Texas, in 1985 and is 39 years old.</p>

<p>The fugitive is between 5 feet, 1 inch and 5 feet, 3 inches tall; 120- 140 pounds; has a medium complexion and tattoos on her back, both legs, right arm, right hand, and right calf. She has brown eyes and brown hair.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kamala Harris on Friday described for the first time US President Joe Biden's phone call informing her he was planning to quit the race to the White House. Speaking to CNN, Ms Harris, who has replaced Mr Biden as the Democratic presidential candidate, said she was at home making pancakes and bacon for her nieces when her phone rang.</p>

<p>"It was Joe Biden, and he told me what he had decided to do. And I asked him, 'Are you sure?' And he said, 'Yes,'" she told CNN while describing the Sunday call in July.</p>

<p>"My first thought was not about me, to be honest with you. My first thought was about him," she added.</p>

<p>This was her first one-on-one interview with a major news network since Joe Biden ended his reelection campaign last month and endorsed her.</p>

<p>Biden, 81, ended his second-term bid on July 21 after his disastrous June 27 debate performance against his Republican rival <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/americans-ready-to-turn-the-page-on-donald-trump-says-kamala-harris-6449417" target="_blank">Donald Trump</a> triggered a slow-burning Democrat revolt against him.</p>

<p>"He (Biden) has the intelligence, the commitment, and the judgment and disposition that I think the American people rightly deserve in their president," Ms Harris said in her joint CNN sit-down with her running mate Tim Walz.</p>

<p>She also said she is running for president because she believes that she is the "best person to do this job at this moment for all Americans, regardless of race and gender."</p>

<p>The US Vice President also said that Americans were ready to "turn the page" on divisions she blamed on her rival Donald Trump.</p>

<p>"Sadly in the last decade, we have had in the former president someone who has really been pushing an agenda and an environment that is about diminishing the character and the strength of who we are as Americans, really dividing our nation," the Democrat said.</p>

<p>"And I think people are ready to turn the page on that," she added.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[US Vice President Kamala Harris said in her first interview of her presidential campaign Thursday that Americans were ready to "turn the page" on divisions she blamed on her rival Donald Trump.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kamala Harris declared Thursday that Americans are ready to turn the page on Donald Trump and chart a new path for the country, in her first major interview since her dramatic entry into November's presidential election.</p>

<p>Harris, 59, aimed to stake out a centrist position on CNN, insisting that she will be tough on illegal immigration and support controversial oil and gas fracking -- but not abandon her longtime liberal values.</p>

<p>The first female and Black and South Asian vice president described Trump as "pushing an agenda and an environment that is about diminishing the character and the strength of who we are as Americans, really dividing our nation."</p>

<p>"I think people are ready to turn the page on that," she said. "People are ready for a new way forward."</p>

<p>The Democrat also said that she would name a Republican to her cabinet if she wins November's election, in her joint CNN sit-down with her running mate Tim Walz.</p>

<p>Trump meanwhile branded Harris the "greatest flip-flopper" as he addressed a rally in the swing state of Michigan, before mocking her appearance in the interview.</p>

<p>"She didn't look like a leader to me," the Republican said.</p>

<p>Harris rejected criticism that she has shifted positions on politically sensitive issues including fracking, which she once opposed but now supports, and illegal migration over the Mexican border, where she has taken a harder line.</p>

<p>"As president I will not ban fracking," she said -- clearly aiming to settle the controversy in fossil-fuel-rich Pennsylvania, one of the vital battleground states in what's expected to be a tight election.</p>

<p>Addressing criticism that she had been too soft on immigration -- a core part of Trump's message -- Harris said that as president she would sign tough legislation.</p>

<p>Harris is reaching for centrist voters worried by immigration and fuel costs. But in a nod to her left-leaning supporters, she insisted that she had not fundamentally shifted.</p>

<p>"My values have not changed," Harris said.</p>

<p>On another hot-button topic on the US political landscape, Harris urged a ceasefire in Gaza, but told CNN that she would not change President Joe Biden's policies for key US ally Israel, including deliveries of weaponry.</p>

<h2><strong>Honeymoon period?</strong></h2>

<p>Republicans had criticized Harris for not giving any interviews since Biden abruptly dropped out of the White House race nearly six weeks ago, following mounting concerns over his health and age at 81.</p>

<p>Harris has enjoyed a honeymoon period with surging polls and record fundraising, but has also faced scrutiny for keeping many of her policies vague as she pulls her campaign together.</p>

<p>Harris gave the interview while on a campaign bus tour of Georgia, one of the seven battleground states that are expected to decide the November 5 election.</p>

<p>A number of polls out Thursday showed Harris ahead of Trump, if only marginally, with several of them finding increased support for Harris in battleground states.</p>

<p>A Bloomberg/Morning Consult poll found Harris leading in six out of the seven swing states while a Fox poll also showed increasing support in the battlegrounds.</p>

<p>At a rally in Savannah at the end of the two-day swing in Georgia, which Democrats flipped from Trump in 2020, she admitted it was "going to be a tight race until the very end."</p>

<p>Trump has himself been hitting the campaign trail hard in recent days, after a period where the 78-year-old former president appeared to struggle to find his footing against a new, younger, female candidate.</p>

<p>Speaking at an event in Potterville, Michigan on Thursday, Trump targeted Harris on her immigration policy shifts: "Now she's saying, 'Oh we want to build a strong border."</p>

<p>"Where has she been for three and a half years?"</p>

<p>Harris and Trump are set to face off in their pivotal first debate on September 10 in Philadelphia.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>AI startup OpenAI said on Thursday its chatbot ChatGPT now has more than 200 million weekly active users, double the number it had in the last fall season.</p>

<p>ChatGPT, launched in 2022, can generate human-like responses based on user prompts and had 100 million weekly active users, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman had said in November.</p>

<p>OpenAI said 92% of Fortune 500 companies are using its products and the use of its automated Application Programming Interface, or API, which allows software programs to talk to each other, has doubled since the launch of ChatGPT-4o mini in July.</p>

<p>GPT-4o mini is a cost-efficient small AI model, aimed at making its technology more affordable and less energy-intensive, allowing the startup to target a broader pool of customers.</p>

<p>ChatGPT has driven AI's popularity and fueled a meteoric rise in the valuation of the San Francisco-based OpenAI.</p>

<p>Separately, AI startups OpenAI and Anthropic signed deals with the U.S. government for research, testing and evaluation of their artificial intelligence models, the U.S. Artificial Intelligence Safety Institute said earlier in the day.</p>

<p>Media reports said Apple and Nvidia are in talks to invest in OpenAI as part of a new fundraising round that would value the ChatGPT maker above $100 billion.</p>

<p>OpenAI-backer Microsoft is also expected to invest in the firm, according to the reports.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Until quite recently, Nvidia wasn't much of a household name outside of Silicon Valley or Wall Street. But times clearly have changed for the Santa Clara, California-based tech company with the easily mispronounced moniker. Across a growing range of technologies and gadgets, tiny chips made by <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-ai/nations-building-their-own-ai-models-add-to-nvidias-growing-chip-demand-6442955">Nvidia play an outsized</a> role in our lives. And thanks to the explosion of artificial intelligence, perhaps our future as well.</p>

<p>But before <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/nvidia-chief-says-new-blackwell-chip-will-have-lots-and-lots-of-supply-6442491">Nvidia became the world's most valuable</a> chipmaker, the $3 trillion company had a more humble calling: making graphics cards for video game consoles. In the Bloomberg Originals mini-documentary How Nvidia Changed the Game, we show how a gargantuan technology company that's held investors in its thrall got so big seemingly overnight.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Nvidia didn't have a great day on Wednesday (or today for that matter)-not because its $32.5 billion revenue projection for the third quarter was somehow terrible, but rather because it didn't blow the doors off of analyst projections. However, none of the Wall Street handwringing that's followed diminishes the story of how the company managed to succeed thanks to an incredible bit of long-term planning.</p>

<p>Today, Nvidia dominates the graphics industry. But when it started back in the 1990s, it was just one of many fledgling tech companies with similar ideas. Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang chose to focus on an area where there was a lot of money to be made: video games. While using the cash that tumbled in to fund Nvidia's research and development, he leveraged the company's accelerating chip technology to branch out to a wider range of products and sectors.</p>

<p>In How Nvidia Changed the Game, Bloomberg Originals shows how this strategy eventually placed Nvidia at the heart of dual revolutions in cryptocurrency and-most importantly-artificial intelligence.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A heat wave brought record-high temperatures to US Midwest states this week, with more than 60 million people included in alerts over the conditions.</p>

<p>A late-season high-pressure system over cities in the Midwest regions such as Chicago, Des Moines and Topeka has left them experiencing rare "extreme heat" for a long period of time, Xinhua news agency reported, citing the US National Weather Service (NWS).</p>

<p>The NWS warned the public of the combined dangers of heat and humidity associated with heat waves.</p>

<p>US Midwest states have set up several public cooling centres in preparation for the dangerous heat.</p>

<p>Extreme heat together with humidity is one of the leading weather-related killers in the United States. Approximately 1,220 people in the country are killed by extreme heat every year, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump said Thursday he would have the government or insurance companies cover the cost of in-vitro fertilization for "all Americans who need it" in a second term -- although he declined to say how he would pay for it.</p>

<p>Reproductive rights have been a major vulnerablity for the Republican White House nominee ever since the Supreme Court gutted federal protections for abortion access in 2022.</p>

<p>Trump's weakness was further exacerbated after an Alabama court ruled in February that frozen embryos created via IVF should be considered children.</p>

<p>Trump said he supported IVF after several clinics paused their care following the Alabama decision.</p>

<p>"I'm announcing today in a major statement that, under the Trump administration, your government will pay for -- or your insurance company will be mandated to pay for -- all costs associated with IVF treatment," he told a rally in Potterville, Michigan.</p>

<p>He offered no detail on how his proposal would work, including how it would be funded, but when the announcement was previewed in an interview with NBC ahead of the event, Trump said one option would be to have insurance companies pay "under a mandate."</p>

<p>Experts say the 2022 US Supreme Court ruling effectively granted states the final say on questions of personhood, paving the way for wide-reaching impacts on other areas of reproductive health, including IVF.</p>

<p>Few Americans have insurance plans that cover fertility treatments in any case, with costs of $20,000 or more for a single, 18-month round of IVF treatment too expensive for many.</p>

<p>The ex-president added that under a second Trump term, new parents would be able to deduct "major newborn expenses" from their tax bill, proclaiming that "we're pro-family."</p>

<p>Although his support for IVF has been consistent since the February ruling, Trump claimed numerous ideological positions on abortion before settling on his current view that the legalities around the procedure should be up to the states.</p>

<p>He told NBC News in 1999 he was "very pro-choice" before announcing he was "pro-life" in 2011 and that women who seek abortions should get "some form of punishment" in 2016.</p>

<p>Trump has taken credit for installing the Supreme Court justices who struck down federal abortion rights, and signaled Thursday how he may vote in a Florida referendum this fall which seeks to reverse his home state's six-week ban.</p>

<p>"I want more than six weeks," he told the Daily Mail. "I think six weeks is a mistake. And I'll be expressing that soon, but I want more than six weeks."</p>

<p>Trump and his election rival, Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris, are campaigning in swing states this week as they embark on the most intense phase of the campaign.</p>

<p>Harris, rallying in Savannah, Georgia, told supporters Trump would sign a national abortion ban into law if he won.</p>

<p>"Ours is a fight for the future. And it is a fight for freedom. Like the freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body, and not have her government tell her what to do," she said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of Japan's strongest typhoons in decades dumped torrential rain across southern regions on Thursday, leaving at least five people dead and injuring dozens, local media reported, as authorities warned millions to seek higher ground due to possible flooding and landslides.</p>

<p>Typhoon Shanshan packed gusts of up to 252 kilometres (157 miles) per hour as it smashed into Japan's main southern island of Kyushu early Thursday, making it the most powerful storm this year and one of the strongest at landfall since 1960.</p>

<p>The storm then weakened, with maximum gusts of 162 kph at 5:00 pm (0800 GMT), the weather office said, but it was still dumping heavy rain across Kyushu and beyond as it moved slowly towards the main island of Honshu.</p>

<p>Five people have been found dead in the storm, Jiji Press reported, including a man whose two-story home collapsed in Tokushima Prefecture.</p>

<p>The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) warned that "the risk of a disaster due to heavy rain can rapidly escalate in western Japan as Friday approaches".</p>

<p>Even before Shanshan hit, heavy precipitation led to three members of the same family being killed in a landslide late Tuesday in Aichi prefecture around 1,000 kilometres (600 miles) from Kyushu.</p>

<p>Authorities issued their highest alert in several areas of the country, with more than five million people advised to evacuate, although it was unclear how many did.</p>

<p>Kunisaki city in the Oita region of Kyushu warned inhabitants to "evacuate to a safe place or higher place such as the second floor of your house" because of the risk of flooding.</p>

<p>At least 80 people were injured across Kyushu, the JMA said.</p>

<p>Rains turned rivers into raging torrents while winds smashed windows and blew tiles off roofs. TV images showed flooded roads and power lines being repaired.</p>

<p>The coastal city of Miyazaki, littered with debris from nearly 200 damaged buildings, reported 25 injuries -- including some from a tornado.</p>

<p>Some parts of Miyazaki prefecture saw record rains for August, with the town of Misato recording a staggering 791.5 millimetres (31 inches) in 48 hours, the JMA said.</p>

<p>Worried student Aoi Nishimoto, 18, said he had called his family in Miyazaki to see if they were safe.</p>

<p>"Our home is fine, but there was a tornado in Miyazaki and power went out in some places," he told AFP in Kyushu's main city of Fukuoka.</p>

<p>"This year, I am away from my parents' home for the first time. So it's a bit scary being all alone," fellow student Rio Ohtsuru, 19, told AFP.</p>

<p>"Maybe I will look for a flashlight in case of a power outage," she said.</p>

<p>Kyushu's utility operator said 187,010 houses were without power elsewhere on the island.</p>

<p>- Climate change -</p>

<p>Shanshan comes in the wake of Typhoon Ampil, which dumped heavy rain that disrupted hundreds of flights and trains this month but caused only minor injuries and damage.</p>

<p>Typhoons in the region have been forming closer to coastlines, intensifying more rapidly and lasting longer over land due to climate change, according to a study released last month.</p>

<p>Another released by World Weather Attribution (WWA) on Thursday said that climate change turbocharged Typhoon Gaemi, which killed dozens of people across the Philippines, Taiwan and China this year.</p>

<p>In the city of Usa, retiree Fukashi Oishi looked forlornly at an old tree opposite his house that was already mature when he was a child but had snapped and fallen on the road.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's so sad," he told AFP.</p>

<p>- Toyota production halt -</p>

<p>Auto giant Toyota suspended production at all 14 of its factories in Japan.</p>

<p>Nissan and Honda also halted operations at their Kyushu plants, as did chipmakers including Tokyo Electron, reports said.</p>

<p>Kyushu is a hub for the semiconductor industry, with chip giant Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company opening a plant there in February.</p>

<p>Japan Airlines and ANA cancelled more than 1,000 domestic flights and four international flights for Thursday and Friday, affecting more than 44,000 passengers.</p>

<p>Rail operators suspended most Shinkansen bullet trains between Kyushu's Hakata and Tokyo, and said services would be disrupted elsewhere on Friday.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Democratic presidential nominee and Vice President Kamala Harris on Thursday emphasised that the current presidential fight is for the future of the United States and asserted that the future is always worth fighting for.</p>

<p>The remarks by Harris came while she addressed a rally in Georgia. Harris during the rally said that they are running as the underdog in the upcoming presidential elections in the country and expressed confidence that she will secure victory in the elections.</p>

<p>"68 days to go... We are here to speak the truth and one of the things that we know is that we are running as the underdog. And we have some hard work ahead of us. But we like hard work. Hard work is good work. And with your help, we are going to win this November," Harris said.</p>

<p>She further said that during her entire career, she has always stood up for people. She said, "I am no stranger to tough fights... I was a courtroom Prosecutor. So every day in the courtroom, I stood proudly before a judge and I spoke five words--Kamala Harris For The People. My entire career, I only had one client--the people. I stood for women and children against predators who used to abuse them... and for seniors facing abuse. I would tell you that those fights were not easy and neither were the elections that put me in those offices."</p>

<p>She further said, "But we never gave up because the future is always worth fighting for. And that is the fight we are in right now. A fight for America's future. We fight for the future with affordable childcare, paid leave and affordable healthcare."</p>

<p>Earlier, Harris said that she intends to appoint a Republican to her cabinet if she wins the upcoming presidential elections, CNN reported.</p>

<p>The remarks by the Vice President came in a joint interview with Walz on CNN.</p>

<p>Harris pledged to serve as a president for all Americans. In the interview, she expressed her willingness to appoint a Republican to her Cabinet if elected. However, she didn't specify a particular individual.</p>

<p>"I've got 68 days to go with this election, so I'm not putting the cart before the horse," she said. "But I would, I think. I think it's really important. I have spent my career inviting diversity of opinion. I think it's important to have people at the table when some of the most important decisions are being made that have different views, different experiences. And I think it would be to the benefit of the American public to have a member of my Cabinet who was a Republican," according to CNN.</p>

<p>Harris was nominated as the Democratic nominee after President Joe Biden quit the presidential race amid mounting concerns over his age, particularly after his poor show in the debate with Donald Trump in June.</p>

<p>If elected president, the 59-year-old Harris would become the first woman in history to become the US president. The vice president is only the second woman ever nominated for the presidency by a major political party.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Elon Musk and his electric vehicle company Tesla won the dismissal of a federal lawsuit accusing them of defrauding investors by hyping the cryptocurrency dogecoin and conducting insider trading, causing billions of dollars of losses.</p>

<p>The decision was issued on Thursday night by U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein in Manhattan.</p>

<p>Investors accused Musk of using Twitter posts, a 2021 appearance on NBC's "Saturday Night Live" and other publicity stunts to trade profitably at their expense through several dogecoin wallets that he or Tesla controlled.</p>

<p>According to the investors, Musk deliberately drove up dogecoin's price more than 36,000% over two years and then let it crash, with he and Tesla often timing trades to Musk's public statements and activities concerning dogecoin.</p>

<p>Investors said this included when Musk sold dogecoin in April 2023 after he replaced the blue bird logo of Twitter, now known as X, with dogecoin's Shiba Inu dog logo, causing dogecoin's price to rise 30%.</p>

<p>In seeking a dismissal, Musk's lawyers said the plaintiffs still had no case despite filing five versions of their lawsuit, which originally sought $258 billion, over two years.</p>

<p>The lawyers said there was nothing wrong with Musk's "innocuous and often silly tweets" about dogecoin, and no proof either that Musk owned two wallets where suspicious trading was conducted, or that he or Tesla ever sold dogecoin.</p>

<p>On "Saturday Night Live," Musk called dogecoin a "hustle" while playing a fictitious financial expert on a segment of "Weekend Update."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Israel's military campaign in Gaza - which started after the deadly October 7 last year in which over 1,100 people were brutally killed - has entered its 10th month and over 40,000 people have died.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel's military campaign in Gaza - which started after the deadly October 7 last year in which over 1,100 people were brutally killed - has entered its 10th month and over 40,000 people have died.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As violence rages in the Gaza Strip, Israel has opened a different front in the West Bank, another Palestinian territory. The large-scale military operation in the West Bank has entered its second day and at least 16 people have died.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As Israel's "war" drags on for 10 months, the focus is back on Israel's AI tools that have been extensively used in its bombing campaign in the Gaza Strip.</p>

<p>'Gospel', 'Alchemist', 'The Death of Wisdom' and 'Lavender' are not titles of a novel but names of the Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools that have been used to process vast amounts of data, identify suspects who have links with Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad and to strike them.</p>

<p>A detailed investigation by <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.972mag.com/lavender-ai-israeli-army-gaza/" rel="no index, no follow">+972 Magazine and Local Call</a> reveals some disturbing details from Israel's bombing campaign, especially how the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) fully relied on a tool for its bombing missions.</p>

<p><strong>'Lavender' and its use case</strong></p>

<p>Lavender, developed by Israel's elite intelligence division, Unit 8200, operates as an AI-powered database designed to identify potential targets linked to Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ). Lavender uses machine learning algorithms and processes vast amounts of data to pinpoint individuals deemed "junior" militants within these armed groups.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Lavender initially identified as many as 37,000 Palestinian men associated with Hamas or PIJ. The usage of AI to identify targets marks a significant change in how the Israeli intelligence apparatus, Mossad and Shin Bet, function - relying on more labour-intensive human decision-making.&nbsp;</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-08/o4og57oo_deir-elbalah-gaza-israel-strike_625x300_27_August_24.jpeg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>Soldiers often made decisions in as little as 20 seconds to determine whether to bomb these identified targets based on Lavender's information, primarily to ascertain the gender of the target. Human soldiers frequently followed the machine's information unquestioningly, despite the AI program's error margin of up to 10 per cent, meaning it could be incorrect up to 10 per cent of the time.</p>

<p>According to the report, the program often targeted individuals with minimal or no affiliation with Hamas.</p>

<p><strong>Gospel - Israel's Another AI Arm</strong></p>

<p>Systems such as "Gospel" are being used to allow automatic tools to produce targets at a fast pace, and works by improving accurate and high-quality intelligence material according to the requirement," the IDF said.<br />
"With the help of artificial intelligence, and through the rapid and automatic extraction of updated intelligence - it produces a recommendation for the researcher, with the goal being that there will be a complete match between the machine's recommendation and the identification performed by a person," the IDF added.</p>

<p>The AI platforms crunch data to select targets for air strikes. Ensuing raids can then be rapidly assembled with another artificial intelligence model called Fire Factory,<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-16/israel-using-ai-systems-to-plan-deadly-military-operations" rel="no index, no follow"> Bloomberg reported</a>. Fire Factory calculates munition loads, prioritizes and assigns thousands of targets to aircraft and drones, and proposes a schedule, the report added.</p>

<p>The report by +972 Magazine mentions the book 'The Human-Machine Team: How to Create Synergy Between Human and Artificial Intelligence That Will Revolutionize Our World'. The author 'Brigadier General YS', who is reportedly the commander of the 8200 Intelligence Unit of Israel, makes a case for the use of AI in "deep defence" and gives scenarios that could threaten Israel in the future.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the chapter "Deep Defense:" New Potentials, the author says "Deep defence is the ability of national establishments to use The Human-Machine Team concept to address security challenges to expose issues in new ways that were heretofore impossible."</p>

<p>The Human-Machine Team should have the ability to identify tens of thousands of targets before the battle begins and thousands of targets should be identified every day. The author makes a case where he explains why it is important to create such tools so that the military can strike at the right targets at the right time with less collateral damage.</p>

<p><strong>What About AI in the Russia-Ukraine War?</strong></p>

<p>AI begets AI. The use of automated tools like unmanned FPV drones, and robots has reduced the human-risk factor for warring nations but has increased the dependency on technology, which seems like a win-win situation for a nation but the ethical and legal concerns of using AI are always followed by the benefits of the technology.</p>

<p>The Russia-Ukraine war is a testing lab for future tools for fighting in combat. The concept of drone attacks has proliferated to different conflicts in different regions, especially non-state actors like Houthi rebels and Hezbollah fighting Israel.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The deployment of automated drones does not simply define the use of AI in conflict.&nbsp;</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-01/3un9tu5g_ukraine-drone_625x300_10_January_24.jpeg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>AI is primarily used to analyze geospatial intelligence by processing satellite images and decoding open-source intelligence like videos, and photos available online. Surveillance drone footage, on-ground human intelligence (HUMINT), satellite images, and open-source data are all combined and processed by AI tools to deliver an outcome that is used to conduct missions. This represents the use of data analytics on the battlefield.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to a report by National Defense magazine, Ukraine reportedly used Clearview AI, a software tool from a US-based firm, for facial recognition to identify dead soldiers and Russian assailants and combat misinformation. US firms like Primer have deployed tools to decode Russian encrypted messages delivered through radio.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Ukraine is working on developing AI-enabled drones to counter radio jamming. Cheap FPV drones, widely used for several months, have witnessed a drop in their hits due to the jamming of radio signals, a form of Electronic Warfare which Russians are masters of.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We are already working with the concept that soon, there will be no connection on the front line" between pilot and UAV, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/ukraine-rushes-create-ai-enabled-war-drones-2024-07-18/#:~:text=AI%20is%20already%20being%20used,hundreds%20of%20kilometres%20inside%20Russia." rel="no index, no follow">Reuters reported</a>, quoting Max Makarchuk, the AI lead for Brave1, a defence tech accelerator set up by the Ukrainian government.</p>

<p>Radio jamming blocks the operator's contact with the munition (a drone) by forming a protective invisible layer around the target, therefore resulting in damage to the drone. Automating the final part of the drone's flight can enable success.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/struggling-not-crumbling-russian-defence-ai-time-war" rel="no follow, no index">Russia is focusing on developing AI</a> systems to counter the West and fight Ukraine on the battlefield. If numbers are compared then Russia is way ahead of Ukraine in terms of military prowess but the Red Army has suffered huge losses on the battlefield.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Areas like increasing command, control and communication with AI-enabled decision-making, developing smarter weapons, which it calls "intellectualization of weapons", and developing more unmanned aerial/ground vehicles and AI-enabled guidance systems for missiles, are in Moscow's focus.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The maker of the Russian Kamikaze drone KUB-LA, ZALA Aero Group, claims it is capable of selecting and engaging targets using AI. The Lancet-3 loitering munition is highly autonomous and the use of sensors enables it to locate and destroy a target without human guidance, even being capable of returning to the operator if a target has not been found.</p>

<p>In May, a Russian <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://ria.ru/20230524/spetsoperatsiya-1873760329.html" rel="no index, no follow">S-350 Vityaz</a>, surface-to-air-missile reportedly shot down an aircraft in autonomous mode, which was claimed as the first AI-enable missile kill. The system detected, tracked and destroyed a Ukrainian air target without human assistance. The claim remains contested.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Heavy investment on both sides of the border reaffirms the central role of AI in war and how future wars could be co-commanded by technology and a human.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>AI startup OpenAI said on Thursday its chatbot ChatGPT now has more than 200 million weekly active users, double the number it had in the last fall season.</p>

<p>ChatGPT, launched in 2022, can generate human-like responses based on user prompts and had 100 million weekly active users, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman had said in November.</p>

<p>OpenAI said 92% of Fortune 500 companies are using its products and the use of its automated Application Programming Interface, or API, which allows software programs to talk to each other, has doubled since the launch of ChatGPT-4o mini in July.</p>

<p>GPT-4o mini is a cost-efficient small AI model, aimed at making its technology more affordable and less energy-intensive, allowing the startup to target a broader pool of customers.</p>

<p>ChatGPT has driven AI's popularity and fueled a meteoric rise in the valuation of the San Francisco-based OpenAI.</p>

<p>Separately, AI startups OpenAI and Anthropic signed deals with the U.S. government for research, testing and evaluation of their artificial intelligence models, the U.S. Artificial Intelligence Safety Institute said earlier in the day.</p>

<p>Media reports said Apple and Nvidia are in talks to invest in OpenAI as part of a new fundraising round that would value the ChatGPT maker above $100 billion.</p>

<p>OpenAI-backer Microsoft is also expected to invest in the firm, according to the reports.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>French President Emmanuel Macron was not aware of Telegram owner Pavel Durov's arrival in France on Saturday and had not been scheduled to meet him, he told a news conference on Thursday during a two-day visit in Serbia.</p>

<p>"I was absolutely unaware of Mr Durov's arrival in France, and that is quite normal because I'm not aware of the comings and goings of citizens from all over the world, whether they have French citizenship or not," Macron said.</p>

<p>Durov was arrested by French police after his jet landed at an airport near Paris. On Wednesday, a French judge put Durov, who has French and UAE citizenship, under formal investigation for suspected complicity in running an online platform that allows illicit transactions, child sex abuse images, drug trafficking and fraud.</p>

<p>Macron also defended France's decision in 2021 to give Durov French citizenship under a rare procedure for high-profile individuals.</p>

<p>"It's part of a strategy to allow women and men, whether artists, athletes or entrepreneurs, when they make the effort to learn the French language and that they develop wealth, innovation ... to be given French nationality," Macron said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel on Thursday pressed a large-scale military operation in the occupied West Bank that killed at least 16 Palestinians in two days, despite UN concerns it was "fuelling an already explosive situation".</p>

<p>The "counter-terrorism" operation underway across the northern West Bank since early Wednesday has killed 16 Palestinians, the Israeli military said. The Palestinian health ministry gave the same figure, after both revised earlier tolls.</p>

<p>The raids on several towns and refugee camps were launched as violence raged on in the war-battered Gaza Strip, the besieged Palestinian territory separated from the West Bank by Israel.</p>

<p>The World Health Organization said Israel had agreed to at least three days of "humanitarian pauses" in parts of Gaza, starting Sunday, to facilitate a vaccination drive after the first case of once-eradicated polio had been confirmed in the territory.</p>

<p>Israeli authorities did not immediately respond to AFP's request for comment, but Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Wednesday the measures were "not a ceasefire" in the nearly 11-month-old war triggered by Hamas's October 7 attack.</p>

<p>In the West Bank, columns of Israeli armoured vehicles backed by troops and aircraft were sent in before soldiers encircled refugee camps in Tubas and Tulkarem, as well as Jenin, and exchanged fire with Palestinian militants.</p>

<p>The army said it killed seven militants on Thursday, including five militants in the Tulkarem refugee camp.</p>

<p>A military statement said one of the five was Muhammad Jaber, also known as Abu Shujaa, who Palestinian militant group Islamic Jihad said was its commander in the nearby Nur Shams refugee camp.</p>

<p>Two other militants were killed in Jenin on Thursday, the army said.</p>

<p>United Nations chief Antonio Guterres called for an "immediate cessation of these operations", which were "fuelling an already explosive situation in the occupied West Bank".</p>

<p>- 'Continuation' of Gaza war -</p>

<p>The violence has caused significant destruction, especially in Tulkarem, whose governor Mustafa Taqatqa described the raids as "unprecedented" and a "dangerous signal".</p>

<p>The UN humanitarian office OCHA said "Israeli forces have repurposed homes as military positions" and were "effectively besieging" several medical facilities.</p>

<p>AFPTV footage showed bulldozers ripping up the asphalt from streets in the city. Widespread damage was reported to infrastructure.</p>

<p>Witnesses said the Israeli forces had withdrawn from Al-Farra refugee camp in Tubas where several Palestinians were killed on Wednesday, including two teenagers according to the Palestinian Red Crescent.</p>

<p>AFP correspondents said clashes were ongoing in Jenin, where a drone was seen flying overhead and the streets were empty, and Israeli soldiers were operating in Tulkarem.</p>

<p>The Palestinian Prisoners' Club advocacy group said at least 45 people had been detained in the West Bank since Wednesday. An Israeli military spokesman said "10 wanted individuals were arrested".</p>

<p>Jordan's King Abdullah II appealed for a ceasefire in Gaza to stop the spread of violence and Iran's foreign ministry condemned the Israeli operation as a "continuation of the genocide in the Gaza Strip".</p>

<p>The United Nations on Wednesday said at least 637 Palestinians had been killed in the West Bank by Israeli troops or settlers since the Gaza war erupted on October 7.</p>

<p>Nineteen Israelis, including soldiers, have been killed in Palestinian attacks or during army operations over the same period, according to Israeli official figures.</p>

<p>Israel has occupied the West Bank since 1967, when it also seized the Gaza Strip, from which it withdrew troops and settlers in 2005 but later imposed a crippling blockade followed by a siege shortly after the October 7 attack.</p>

<p>In Gaza, the Israeli military said it had "eliminated dozens" of militants in a day of combat and strikes.</p>

<p>The civil defence agency in the Hamas-ruled territory said Israeli shelling killed five displaced Palestinians in a tent east of Khan Yunis, southern Gaza's main city.</p>

<p>- 'Lost everything' -</p>

<p>Hamas's October 7 attack on southern Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,199 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory military campaign has killed at least 40,602 people in Gaza, according to the territory's health ministry. The UN rights office says most of the dead are women and children.</p>

<p>The war has devastated Gaza, repeatedly displaced most of its 2.4 million people and triggered a humanitarian crisis.</p>

<p>Palestinians militants on October 7 also seized 251 hostages, 103 of whom are still captive in Gaza including 33 the Israeli military says are dead.</p>

<p>Increasingly desperate families of the hostages gathered at the border with Gaza on Thursday to deliver symbolic messages to their loved ones.</p>

<p>Rachel Goldberg-Polin, the mother of the hostage Hersh Goldberg-Polin, yelled into a microphone: "I love you, stay strong, survive."</p>

<p>She later told AFP that the war had "gone on way too long" and there was "suffering on all sides... it has to stop".</p>

<p>In central Gaza, some Palestinians returned to parts of Deir al-Balah after the military had amended a previous evacuation order.</p>

<p>Mohamed Abu Thuria told AFP he had "found massive destruction everywhere".</p>

<p>Another displaced Gazans back in Deir al-Balah, Ibrahim al-Tabaan, said: "We lost everything."</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>TV show producer Banijay Asia has tied up with Space Exploration and Research Agency (SERA) for a reality show to send an Indian into space on a future Blue Origin New Shepard mission.</p>

<p>Recently, SERA announced India as a partner nation for their human spaceflight programme.</p>

<p>"We're embarking on an unprecedented journey with SERA to create a reality format that transcends the ordinary. It's a privilege to document this journey of an ordinary Indian space traveller and show how this programme will not only transform their life but also democratise space travel more broadly," Deepak Dhar, Founder and Group CEO, Banijay Asia and Endemol Shine India said in a statement.</p>

<p>The format will capture the drama, disappointment, and joy as the shortlisted individuals participate in various challenges that test their mettle and readiness for space travel, a company statement said.</p>

<p>It said the show will culminate in the selection of a final winner who will have the opportunity to travel into space.</p>

<p>"We will pioneer an innovative and inspirational format by blending the thrill of reality television with the awe of space exploration. This will be a game-changing format showing every step of the journey from selection to space," said Mrinalini Jain, Group Chief Development Officer, Banijay Asia and Endemol Shine India.</p>

<p>"This partnership with Banijay Asia will bring space and science-related content to a diverse audience. We look forward to their innovative approach to transform this historic endeavour into a movement that will not only inspire millions but also cultivate a global dialogue on the future of space exploration," Joshua Skurla, Co-Founder, SERA, said.</p>

<p>SERA's spaceflight programme will offer citizens from across the world six seats on a future mission of New Shepard, Blue Origin's reusable suborbital rocket.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>India has targeted to train 175 civil servants from Maldives through tailor-made programmes in specific disciplines, according to an official statement issued today.</p>

<p>A bilateral meeting was held today between National Centre for Good Governance (NCGG) Director General V Srinivas and Maldives Civil Service Commission President Mohamed Nasih to firm up the implementation modalities of the India-Maldives MoU for imparting training to the civil servants of Maldives over a period of five years 2024 -2029, it said.</p>

<p>The Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed and renewed between the NCGG, government of India, and the Civil Service Commission (CSC), Republic of Maldives, for capacity building programs for 1,000 Maldivian civil servants on August 9 in Male, Maldives.</p>

<p>External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar and Maldives' Foreign Minister Moosa Zameer renewed the MoU for the period 2024-2029 as part of the development partnership discussions between both nations, said the statement issued by the Personnel Ministry.</p>

<p>In view of the need of the CSC Maldives, the NCGG agreed to having customised programmes for middle level civil servants and senior civil servants of Maldives, it added.</p>

<p>"The CSC Maldives requested for tailor made specialised programmes in specific disciplines for which NCGG will be designing need-based modules. Five (5) programmes will be held in the year 2024-25 targeting a total of 175 civil servants," the statement said.</p>

<p>In 2024, the NCGG had achieved the remarkable milestone by fulfilling the mandate of training a total of 1,000 civil servants, including Permanent Secretaries, Secretary Generals and high-level delegates from Maldives over a total of 32 capacity building programmes in field administration for the civil servants of Maldives, including programmes for Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) and for Information Commission Office of Maldives (ICOM) under the MoU signed on June 8, 2019.</p>

<p>Recognising the success of this collaboration, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Maldives, had requested for the renewal of the MoU for another five years, the statement said.</p>

<p>This renewed partnership will continue to enhance the capabilities of Maldives civil servants in public policy, governance and field administration, further strengthening the ties between India and the Maldives, it added.</p>

<p>The NCGG is committed to fostering knowledge exchange and collaboration on public policy and governance across several countries.</p>

<p>Its mid-career capacity building programs emphasise citizen-centric governance, improving service delivery and promoting innovations in governance. These programs also showcase India's best practices in digital empowerment of citizens and digital transformation of institutions.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Israeli military and Palestinian militant group Hamas have agreed to three separate, zoned three-day pauses in fighting in the Gaza Strip to allow for the vaccination of some 640,000 children against polio, a senior WHO official said on Thursday.</p>

<p>The vaccination campaign is due to start on Sunday, said Rik Peeperkorn, the World Health Organization's senior official for the region.</p>

<p>He said the campaign would start in central Gaza with a three-day pause in fighting, then move to southern Gaza, where there would be another three-day pause, followed by northern Gaza. Peeperkorn added that there was an agreement to extend the humanitarian pause in each zone to a fourth day if needed.</p>

<p>The WHO confirmed on Aug. 23 that at least one baby has been paralyzed by the type 2 polio virus, the first such case in the territory in 25 years.</p>

<p>The Israeli military's humanitarian unit (COGAT) said on Wednesday that the vaccination campaign would be conducted in coordination with the Israeli military "as part of the routine humanitarian pauses that will allow the population to reach the medical centers where the vaccinations will be administered."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The interim government in Bangladesh on Thursday withdrew the special security cover accorded to deposed Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and her close relatives, days after revoking their diplomatic passports.</p>

<p>The Council of Advisers with Chief Adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus in the chair decided to amend the Special Security Force Act 2021 lifting special security for former prime minister Sheikh Hasina and her close relatives, the official BSS news agency reported.</p>

<p>After Sheikh Hasina, 76, fled to India on August 5, Bangladesh President Mohammad Shahabuddin dissolved Parliament.</p>

<p>Sheikh Hasina currently faces more than 75 cases in Bangladesh, nearly half of them murder charges.</p>

<p>"Against the backdrop of student-people mass upsurge the interim government has been formed on August 8, 2024, comprising the Chief Adviser and other advises," the chief adviser's office (CAO) said in a statement following an advisory council meeting.</p>

<p>The statement noted that the act was enacted and enforced following the previous government's decision. Subsequently, on May 15, 2015, a gazette was issued under this law to provide special security and benefits to Sheikh Hasina and her close relatives.</p>

<p>"The law was made solely to provide special state benefits to the members of one family, which constitutes clear discrimination." The interim government is firmly committed to eliminating all forms of discrimination, it said.</p>

<p>Because of the changed scenario "it is not possible to implement under administrative management the provisions relating to 'Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's family' in line with the existing law, it said.</p>

<p>Talking to journalists after the meeting, advisory council member Syeda Rizwana Hasan said "The interim government was the outcome of an anti-discrimination movement".</p>

<p>Syeda Rizwana, entrusted with the portfolio of environment, forest and climate change ministry, said the council decided to amend the law considering it "discriminatory".</p>

<p>Recently, the Ministry of Home Affairs cancelled the diplomatic passports of Sheikh Hasina, her advisers, former cabinet members, and all members of the 12th Parliament. Diplomatic passports for their spouses and children have also been revoked with immediate effect.</p>

<p>Syeda Rizwana said Bangladesh signed the Instrument of Accession to the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance on Thursday, "demonstrating its commitment to investigate each and every case of enforced disappearances".</p>

<p>"The Chief Advisor has signed the instrument. About 700 people are still missing due to enforced disappearance.</p>

<p>The International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance was adopted in New York on December 20, 2006.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US Army on Thursday took aim at Donald Trump's staff over a visit by the Republican presidential candidate to the country's most hallowed resting place for its war dead.</p>

<p>Trump went to the Arlington National Cemetery just outside Washington with family members of some of the 13 service members killed in a 2021 bombing during the last hours of the US withdrawal from Afghanistan.</p>

<p>His campaign posted photos from the visit, including one showing him giving a thumbs-up gesture while standing with relatives at the grave of one of the Marines killed.</p>

<p>The Army said an Arlington employee was "abruptly pushed aside" when she sought to ensure a law prohibiting political activity on cemetery grounds was followed.</p>

<p>"This incident was unfortunate, and it is also unfortunate that the (Arlington National Cemetery) employee and her professionalism has been unfairly attacked," an Army spokesperson said in a statement.</p>

<p>Going on the offensive, Trump's campaign co-manager Chris LaCivita has described the employee as a "despicable individual," while campaign spokesman Steven Cheung said she was "clearly suffering from a mental health episode."</p>

<p>Trump has made criticism of President Joe Biden's handling of the US retreat from Afghanistan a key note of his campaign ahead of the November election.</p>

<p>The withdrawal was made as part of a peace deal signed by the Trump administration with the Taliban.</p>

<p>Uproar over the incident at Arlington on Monday is the latest controversy in Trump's troubled relationship with the military.</p>

<p>While often touting his support for the armed forces, he privately mocked the war dead while president and did not want to be seen near military amputees, according to his former chief of staff.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is nothing more beautiful than a mother's love and only the mother can go to any length for their children. In a remarkable display of motherly love and courage, a video is doing rounds of the internet in which a mother leopard is seen fighting a lion head-on, to save her two cubs. The incident was recorded inside Serengeti National Park in Tanzania, by Carol and Bob, a couple on an African adventure.</p>

<p>The video shared on October 24, by the YouTube channel “LatestSightings”, details the incident.</p>

<p>Carol and Bob, along with ranger Godliving Shoo, started a Safari ride, early in the morning. Godliving knew of a leopard denning in the area and thought it would be a great time to try and spot her. Before they knew it, the duo spotted the leopard. And her two cubs doubled up as the cherry on top.</p>

<p></p>

<p>But something was off.</p>

<p>The leopard was seen standing on the top of a rock, in a state of paranoia.</p>

<p>“The leopard was outside her den when my husband spotted a lioness crouched just a few meters away, watching intently in the same general direction,” recalled Carol. “We initially thought two separate events were unfolding — the leopard and her cubs, and the lioness watching the wildebeest in the distance. But as she crept forward, we realised she was actually focused on the leopards!”, she added.</p>

<p>The lion walked in. And the leopard jumped and went all in, without worrying about her own life. The fierce leopard kicked the lioness and made her jump back, holding her paw like an injured puppy.</p>

<p>The cubs used this time to hide. When the lioness jumped back, the leopard too escaped.</p>

<p>According to the report, the leopard had to move her cubs twice that afternoon. “She did seem to be exhausted but was left with only minor injuries. As for the lioness, she was left with a very sore leg.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Donald Trump is likely to get a healthy majority in the Senate this time around. However, despite that he may not have the magic 60 seats that would allow him to overcome opposition attempts to delay legislation.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President-elect Donald Trump's Republican Party has won enough seats to retain its control over both chambers of Congress - the House of Representatives and the Senate - cementing its dominant performance in the 2024 United States elections. In Washington DC's political parlance, when a president's party also controls the Congress, it is called "a governing trifecta".</p>

<p>With Republicans cementing their grip on the "Washington trifecta", Mr Trump, after taking charge of the Oval Office, will have much more sweeping authority over the next year to implement his legislative priorities, including major poll promises to enact immigration controls and reduce regulations on Wall Street and the energy industry among others.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-11/0g874728_donald-trump-afp-_625x300_14_November_24.jpeg?im=FaceCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=1200,height=738" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>Had he not won majorities in Congress, Mr Trump's resounding victory over Democrat rival Kamala Harris would still have given him significant control over the formation of the federal government and US foreign policy, both of which are likely to see a significant change during his administration. However, with a governing "trifecta", the incoming President will also be able to get easier approvals for his nominees for posts in his administration - something he had struggled with during his first term back in 2017 when internal resistance within the Republican Party was significantly higher.</p>

<h2><strong>How Does US Congress Work?</strong></h2>

<p>The US Congress has a total of 535 members, including 100 representatives in the Senate and 435 in the House of Representatives. Each of the 50 states in the US sends two Senators to the US Senate. However, the state's representation in the House of Representatives is based on its population. For example, a smaller state like Vermont has one representative while large states like California have 53 representatives</p>

<p>The term of members of the House of Representatives is two years and all 435 seats are considered for reelection every even year. This marks a stark contrast with the Senate, the upper chamber of Congress, where senators serve six-year terms. Elections to the Senate are staggered over even years so that only about 1/3 of the Senate is up for reelection during any election.</p>

<p>The single-party control of Congress, which was once common, has become rare and short over the past few decades, with the party in power losing seats when midterm congressional elections are held every two years. Both former President Trump and President Joe Biden enjoyed "trifectas" for their first two years in the White House, but the dynamics changed following midterm polls.</p>

<h3><strong>Does 'Trifecta' Guarantee Absolute Power?</strong></h3>

<p>A 'trifecta' is no guarantee against political infighting. Despite the Biden administration having "trifecta" from 2021 to 2023, internal dissent stymied certain policy priorities, with figures like Arizona's independent Senator Kyrsten Sinema resisting party orthodoxy.</p>

<p>A major obstacle in the way of total control by either party is that it requires a three-fifths majority - or 60 votes out of 100 - to pass bills in the Senate. Therefore, to bypass the filibuster or the tradition of unlimited debate, a party needs a healthy majority in the Senate. Hence, should a party have a simple majority in the Senate, it needs to reach across the aisle to get a bill passed.</p>

<p>As per a report in the New York Times, Mr Trump is likely to get a healthy majority in the Senate this time around. However, despite that, he may not have the magic 60 seats that would allow him to overcome opposition attempts to delay legislation.</p>

<p>Moreover, there are already signs that Donald Trump may not have his way at all times, with his party selecting John Thune as the Senate majority leader despite Rick Scott being reportedly favoured for the post by by Trump.</p>

<p>Though Mr Trump did not officially endorse Scott, the American media is seeing Mr Thune's selection as a sign that some Republican lawmakers are asserting their independence.</p>

<h3><strong>How The "Trifecta" Can Benefit Trump</strong></h3>

<p>All said, if managed astutely, a "trifecta" can open the way for the possibility of significant legislative initiatives. A majority in both chambers of Congress may give Mr Trump an advantage in pushing through his right-wing agenda and big poll promises like the largest deportation of migrants in history, sweeping tariffs on foreign imports, and the rolling back of environmental protections.</p>

<p>As per the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/13/us/elections/republican-house-trifecta.html" rel="No follow, no index" target="_blank">NYT</a> report, using legislation to achieve these goals will make them much harder to overturn in the courts, especially with the judicial landscape also in Mr Trump's favour. In his first term, the former President was able to put three conservatives in the Supreme Court - cementing a two-thirds majority for years to come. He also named more than four dozen judges to the federal appeals courts, bending several circuits to a more conservative bent.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A latest survey by Bumble, the women-first dating app, reveals that dating habits are changing globally, especially for Gen Z women. In reality, they're just raising the bar and demanding greater sincerity, even though some people might think they're giving up dating completely.</p>

<p>More than 40,000 Gen Z and millennial Bumble users worldwide, including over 2,000 singles in India, participated in <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://bumble-buzz.com/bumble-dating-trends-2025/">the survey,</a> which found that dating is changing as people become more optimistic about the difficulties of finding the appropriate partner.</p>

<p><strong>Key Dating Trends for 2025:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Micro-mance:</strong> Romance is making a comeback, with over half of women globally embracing their romantic side.</p>

<p><strong>DWM (Date With Me):</strong> Real and raw dating content is gaining popularity, as 41% of singles globally appreciate the honest portrayal of dating experiences.</p>

<p><strong>On The Same (Fan) Page:</strong> Shared interests and hobbies are becoming powerful attraction boosters, with 60% of UK singles recognizing the importance of quirky connections.</p>

<p><strong>Male Casting: </strong>Men are challenging traditional gender roles and stereotypes, prompting conversations about masculinity and its impact on relationships.</p>

<p><strong>Future-Proofing: </strong>Concerns about the future are influencing dating choices, with women prioritizing stability and emotional reliability in partners.</p>

<p><strong>Guys That Get It:</strong> Men are evolving into better friends and support systems, fostering deeper connections with women.</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://bumble-buzz.com/bumble-dating-trends-2025/">Bumble's research</a>, women are looking for real connections and aren't prepared to lower their standards any more. They place a high priority on emotional connection, honesty, and shared values. Men are therefore being urged to be more genuine, sympathetic, and helpful.</p>

<p>The quest for deeper connections is the driving force behind this change in dating dynamics. People who are single are actively looking for companions who can provide emotional support, understand their goals, and share their beliefs. The emphasis on creating enduring relationships is replacing the days of casual dating.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Adapting to a sea level rise of up to 0.5 metres (1.64 feet) will cost the three most vulnerable Pacific atoll nations nearly $10 billion - equivalent to about 20 years of gross domestic product - the World Bank said in a report on Thursday.</p>

<p>Kiribati, Tuvalu and Marshall Islands are among the smallest, most remote and dispersed countries in the world, spread across 6.4 million square kilometres (2.47 million square miles) of Pacific Ocean, where residents live at an elevation of no more than 2-3 metres, the report said.</p>

<p>A third of the population of Kiribati and Tuvalu are at risk of falling into extreme poverty from climate shocks such as coastal flooding, while healthcare is under pressure from increased heat-related illness, it said.</p>

<p>A sea level rise of 0.5 metres, which would submerge significant portions of these nations, could occur as soon as 2050 under a worst case scenario, or more likely by 2070, and it was imperative for governments to act on adaptation plans now, it said.</p>

<p>Money is a central focus of the COP29 climate talks being held in Azerbaijan and the success of the summit is likely to be judged on whether nations can agree a new target for how much richer nations, development lenders and the private sector must provide each year to developing countries to finance climate action.</p>

<p>The Pacific atolls face a significant climate funding gap, the World Bank report said.</p>

<p>The cost of physical adaptation, by building seawalls in urban centres, house raising and inland relocation, for a sea level rise of up to 0.5 metres, was estimated at $3.7 billion for Kiribati, $1 billion for Tuvalu, and $5 billion for Marshall Islands.</p>

<p>"This represents about 20 years of current GDP dedicated fully to physical adaptation measures," the report said.</p>

<p>The estimate excludes the cost of other adaptation measures needed in health, education, power and water systems.</p>

<p>Importing sand and rock to build sea walls and raise and reclaim shorelines will also be costly and challenging, it added.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Indian-American entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy on Wednesday reacted to his high school graduation speech video that is doing rounds on social media. Sharing the clip on X (formerly Twitter), the biotech investor said that he was "against bureaucracy back then too" - with a laughing emoji.</p>

<p>Mr Ramaswamy's comment reflects that his ideologies go much back in time.</p>

<p>In the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/vivek-ramaswamys-high-school-graduation-speech-goes-viral-ahead-of-doge-appointment-with-elon-musk-7015437">22-year-old video</a>, a young Mr Ramaswamy is seen addressing his graduating class and guests at Ohio's St. Xavier High School. In the speech, he reflects on his journey through high school.</p>

<p>"I have been racing my entire high school career, but now, when we are finally crossing the finish line, I wish I could have stopped, just a little earlier, and catch a breath of the fresh air that has surrounded me the whole time," he said.</p>

<p>Drawing literary references from his English class, Ramaswamy said, "It is better to travel than it is to arrive" - admitting to having mixed feelings about the moment - graduating high school.</p>

<p>"How am I supposed to feel right now?" he asked, processing his final moments at the university.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">I was against bureaucracy back then too. ? <a href="https://t.co/zVJiDCTMWh">https://t.co/zVJiDCTMWh</a></p>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Born and raised in Cincinnati, Ohio, Mr Ramaswamy was a nationally-ranked tennis player and the valedictorian of his high school. He graduated in Biology from Harvard and received his J D (Juris Doctor) from Yale Law School while working at a hedge fund.</p>

<p>After completing his education, Mr Ramaswamy started his own biotech company, Roivant Sciences - where he oversaw the development of five drugs that went on to become FDA-approved.</p>

<p>In 2022, he founded Strive, an Ohio-based asset management firm.</p>

<p>Recently, US President-elect Donald Trump appointed Mr Ramaswamy and tech billionaire Elon Musk as leads of 'Department of Government Efficiency' - a new wing in the US government. However, these roles are informal and are outside the government - which will not need Senate approval.</p>

<p>According to Trump, Musk and Ramaswamy's mission under this department will be to dismantle government bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure federal agencies.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Boeing Co. will start sending out pink slips on Wednesday to employees affected by a planned round of job cuts, a delicate balancing act between improving efficiency and keeping together a skilled workforce to help lift output again.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The company announced a 10% reduction in positions last month, equivalent to about 17,000 employees. The move is aimed at restoring Boeing's competitive edge as it reels from multiple crises, including reduced output in the wake of a near-catastrophic accident in January and a strike that shut down most of its production for seven weeks.</p>

<p>But if Boeing cuts too deep or in the wrong places, it risks undermining its eventual recovery from years of turmoil. Manufacturers like Boeing used to count on a large portion of furloughed workers to eventually return to work. That pattern was broken when its Covid-era layoffs spurred a permanent exodus, including top-flight engineers and mechanics.&nbsp;</p>

<p>And these days, workers have more options. Unemployment in Seattle is hovering at 4% and aerospace workers are in high demand, particularly with the region's booming space economy.</p>

<p>Rivals like SpaceX, Blue Origin LLC and Amazon.com Inc.'s Project Kuiper are all searching for new hires to support rapidly growing operations around Seattle, where Boeing manufactures most of its commercial airplanes, said Stan Shull, a space industry analyst and consultant at Alliance Velocity LLC. The opportunities range from working on Starlink satellites for Elon Musk's space venture to helping with rockets, space stations, lunar landers and the like for Jeff Bezos's rival company.</p>

<p><strong>Tight Market</strong></p>

<p>There are about 1,350 job openings at more than 50 space companies in the Puget Sound region, by Shull's count. While engineers of all stripes are in demand, the companies are also searching for machinists, administrative help, sales and marketing staff and other positions, said Shull.</p>

<p>Shifting demographics within the US workforce and continued low unemployment mean Boeing will face more competition when it needs to resume hiring to support its growth, said Richard Aboulafia, a managing director with AeroDynamic Advisory.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"It works fine as long as labor markets aren't tight," Aboulafia said in an interview. "But aerospace and defense labor markets are really tight."</p>

<p>Besides, rolling out blanket workforce cuts are "the surest formula for losing 10% of your best people" who will gravitate to potentially more stable employers, Aboulafia said.</p>

<p>The lost institutional knowledge was apparent as the company made only halting progress ramping up manufacturing of its 737 Max jetliner this decade. Executives later acknowledged they'd underestimated the training required to bring the large influx of new hires up to speed in their factories.</p>

<p><strong>'Reset Priorities'</strong></p>

<p>Even so, the company is staffed for peak production levels it likely won't see for years, especially after a 53-day strike largely halted work in its plants across the west coast. Boeing had 171,000 employees at the start of this year, 12% more than the 153,000 it employed five years earlier, when its factories were at their pre-crisis peak.</p>

<p>Relations between workers and Boeing hit a low during the strike that just ended. Boeing was finally able to settle the dispute with concessions including a 38% wage improvement, but many employees remain antagonized by a company they say has not paid them fairly for years.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Kelly Ortberg, who was hired in August as chief executive officer to turn around Boeing, has said the 10% workforce reduction is part of a broader campaign to cut out bloat and inefficiency.</p>

<p>"We need to reset priorities and create a leaner, more focused organization," Ortberg said during an Oct. 23 earnings call. The cuts are intended to "focus on consolidation of areas where we're not efficient, and we need to continue to focus on reducing non-essential activity."&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President-elect Donald Trump and Tesla CEO Elon Musk took the stage at Mar-a-Lago on Wednesday night to perform a rendition of<em> 'God Bless America' </em>alongside opera singer Christopher Macchio. The event took place as Musk joined Trump and other supporters for election night celebrations. The duo's impromptu duet quickly gained traction on social media after being shared by Trump's aide, Margo Martin. Notably, the performance came just a day after Trump announced Elon Musk's new role leading the Department of Government Efficiency in his administration, alongside Vivek Ramaswamy.</p>

<p>Musk, who had endorsed Trump and contributed significant funding to pro-Trump initiatives, has become an influential ally in Trump's recent political efforts. On Wednesday,&nbsp;Musk was appointed to co-lead the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/elon-musk-to-lead-us-government-efficiency-department-donald-trump-7006239#pfrom=home-ndtv_topscroll">Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)</a>&nbsp;alongside Vivek Ramaswamy, a fellow Trump supporter and entrepreneur.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Notably, Mar-a-Lago is a historic estate and private club in Palm Beach, Florida, owned by Donald Trump. Originally built in the 1920s by heiress Marjorie Merriweather Post, the 126-room mansion spans over 17 acres, including beachfront property. Trump purchased Mar-a-Lago in 1985 and later converted it into a private membership club. Known for its opulent architecture and lavish decor, it serves as both a social hub and Trump's winter residence, frequently hosting political events, fundraisers, and gatherings for high-profile guests.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President-elect Donald Trump has named former Democratic representative-turned-staunch supporter Tulsi Gabbard as the Director of National Intelligence for his second term. As part of her job, she will oversee 18 spy agencies in the United States.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After leaving the Democratic Party in 2022, Gabbard endorsed Trump earlier this year. A veteran and one-time Democratic White House contender, Gabbard brings the "fearless spirit that has defined her illustrious career to our intelligence community," Trump said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Gabbard, who earlier opposed US support for Ukraine, thanked the President-elect for the opportunity, adding she was looking forward to getting to work."</p>

<p>With Gabbard all set to succeed Avril Haines as the Director of National Intelligence, here are five facts about her:</p>

<h2><strong>1. Early Life</strong></h2>

<p>Tulsi Gabbard was born on April 12, 1981, in Leloaloa, American Samoa. When she was two years old, her family settled in Hawaii. As a teenager, she co-founded the Healthy Hawai'i Coalition, an environmental non-profit. She completed a B.S.B.A. in Business Administration from the Hawaii Pacific University in 2009. Her father, Mike Gabbard, switched from the Republican Party to Democrats and is a Hawaii State Senator. She is married to Abraham Williams, a cinematographer.</p>

<h2><strong>2. Military Service</strong></h2>

<p>Gabbard has served for over two decades in the Army National Guard. She was deployed to Iraq and Kuwait. In 2005, she was honoured with a Combat Medical Badge for "participation in combat operations under enemy hostile fire in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom III," per the Hawaii National Guard. Although Gabbard has not held any senior government roles unlike past directors, she has two years of experience on the House Homeland Security Committee.</p>

<h2><strong>3. First Hindu elected to Congress</strong></h2>

<p>Gabbard was elected to Hawaii's House of Representatives at 21 but had to leave after a single term following her National Guard unit's deployment to Iraq. Later, she was elected to Congress where she represented Hawaii. She became the first Hindu member of the House and was sworn into office with her hand on the Bhagavad Gita. She was also the first American Samoan elected to Congress.</p>

<h2><strong>4. Presidential aspirations and party exit</strong></h2>

<p>In 2020, Gabbard came into the spotlight, seeking the Democratic nomination for the President. She opposed the country's involvement in foreign military conflicts. She later opted out of the race and endorsed Joe Biden, who eventually won the election. After nearly two years, she left the Democratic Party.</p>

<h2><strong>5. Trump campaign</strong></h2>

<p>Earlier this year, Gabbard extended support to Donald Trump, receiving popularity among his supporters. At a rally in North Carolina in October, she officially announced becoming a Republican and termed the current Democratic Party "completely unrecognisable".</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A fossilised skeleton, Australopithecus afarensis, best known by her nickname 'Lucy', was unearthed by researchers 50 years ago this month in the Afar region of Ethiopia. It eventually went on to transform scientists' understanding of human evolution.<br />
<br />
Opening a new chapter in human history, the discovery by Don Johanson, an American palaeontologist and graduate student Tom Gray on November 24, 1974, provided proof that the ancient hominins could walk upright on two feet 3.2 million years ago — a trait thought to have evolved more recently, <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/12/science/lucy-fossil-discovery-50th-anniversary-don-johanson/index.html">CNN </a>reported.<br />
<br />
Lucy had a mixture of ape and humanlike traits, suggesting she occupied a pivotal branch in the family tree of humans. Over the past few decades, she has encouraged multiple researches and debates, besides igniting a broader public fascination with human origins.<br />
<br />
Although researchers have now unearthed fossil hominins twice as old as Lucy, she continues to remain a key subject for scientific studies.<br />
<br />
At the time when it was found, Lucy had 47 bones and was the oldest known and the most complete skeleton of early human ancestors.<br />
<br />
Reminiscing his 1974 Ethiopia visit, Don Johanson told CNN he was walking on sediment 3.2 million years in age to search for the fossilised remains of various kinds of animals, "but particularly the remains of our ancestors."&nbsp;<br />
<br />
"I happened to look over my right shoulder. If I had looked over my left shoulder, I would have missed it," he said.<br />
<br />
At first, he witnessed a little fragment of bone, a little part of the elbow as well as a part of a forearm.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
He could tell "immediately that it was from a human ancestor," Johanson said, adding when he and his student, Tom Gray, kneeled to have a closer look, they saw "fragments of the skull and fragments of a pelvis and fragments of an arm bone and the leg bone."&nbsp;<br />
<br />
"I realized at that moment that here was the childhood dream... I'd always wanted to go to Africa to find something and by golly this was something. But we didn't know how much it would become an icon in the study of human origins," Johanson said.<br />
<br />
At the time of discovery, Lucy's bones were "very fragile" because they had mineralised and changed into stone. So, the team did a "very careful crawl to pick up the obvious pieces," before they put them into the burlap bags.<br />
<br />
Later, they water-washed them in the stream via fine screening. The whole process took two and a half weeks.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Johanson recalled it was wonderful to see Lucy come together on the lab table in the field. "The femur there was only about a foot long, or 28 centimetres long. What is this? I thought. Is this a child? Well, let's look at the jaw. The wisdom teeth had erupted so she was an adult. But my god, if this was an adult, it had to have been only about 3 and a half feet tall, a meter tall," he added.<br />
<br />
Asked how it got the name Lucy, Johanson said it had a delicate nature of the bones and the short stature, so they felt "she was probably a female."<br />
<br />
He went on to say that while Lucy's species did not give rise directly to modern humans, "her pivotal place on the human family tree led to all later hominin species, most of which went extinct."&nbsp;<br />
<br />
"The Homo lineage persisted and ultimately gave rise to us, Homo sapiens," he concluded.<br />
<br />
<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Imagine a wheelchair equipped with wheels flexible enough to navigate all manner of obstacles from kerbs to humps and even staircases.</p>

<p>Or perhaps an unmanned delivery vehicle using the same wheels that take the stairs to deliver food and groceries right to your doorstop.</p>

<p>This is what researchers from the Korea Institute of Machinery and Materials (KIMM) envision for their 'morphing' wheel, which can roll over obstacles up to 1.3 times the height of its radius.</p>

<p>Inspired by the surface tension of water droplets, it goes from solid to fluid when it encounters impediments.</p>

<p>Other possible applications include robots that spy on the enemy in the battlefield.</p>

<p>The KIMM team also hopes that morphing wheels will eventually be used with two and four-legged robots, which are currently limited in movement efficiency and susceptible to vibration, that can carry payloads that need stable movement in industrial settings.</p>

<p>"The goal is to make this viable for speed up to 100 kph, or the speed of an average car," said Song Sung-hyuk, principal researcher at South Korea's KIMM.</p>

<p>Wheels developed for a similar purpose such as non-pneumatic or airless tires have flexibility but are limited in their ability to overcome obstacles, said Song, who is a member of KIMM's AI robotics research team.</p>

<p>The morphing wheel consists of an outer hoop of a chain and a series of spoke wires running through the hub. The stiffness of the spokes - and hence the wheel - is automatically regulated by a sensor as it reacts to the terrain.</p>

<p>Song's team demonstrated to Reuters a prototype wheelchair mounted on morphing wheels as it climbed stairs with 18 cm steps with a life-size dummy sitting in it. The team has also tested a device mounted with the wheel at speeds of up to 30 kph.</p>

<p>The morphing wheel was the cover article of the journal Science Robotics in August.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 22-year-old Chinese woman's account of how she was lured into the country's illegal surrogacy industry before suffering a miscarriage went viral on Chinese social media this week and raised heated debates over women's rights and social inequality.</p>

<p>Surrogacy is banned in China, and authorities have vowed to severely crack down on illegal practices, including the buying and selling of sperm, egg, and surrogacy services.</p>

<p>The incident comes as Chinese authorities grapple with how to increase the country's birth rate as more young couples put off having children or opt to have none.</p>

<p>China's population fell for a second consecutive year in 2023 and Beijing in October rallied local governments to direct resources towards fixing China's population crisis to create a "birth-friendly" society.</p>

<p>Zhang Jing, 22, told state-backed Phoenix TV magazine that she donated her eggs out of financial desperation and then agreed to "rent out her uterus" to be impregnated for a total of 30,000 yuan ($4,152).</p>

<p>If she "successfully" delivered the baby, she would be paid a total of 240,000 yuan. At five months pregnant, she experienced severe complications and had to have an abortion.</p>

<p>Zhang's story amassed more than 86 million views and 10,000 comments on the Chinese social media platform Weibo, with the hashtag "#2000s-born Surrogate Miscarriage Girl Speaks Out#."</p>

<p>The majority of comments strongly opposed surrogacy. Some warned that legalising surrogacy in China could lead to increased competition that would lower compensation and further devalue women.</p>

<p>"No woman could escape this if surrogacy were legalised," one user wrote, while another said, "Legalising surrogacy would drive down prices and commodify women."</p>

<p>Zhang's story ignited calls for a more thorough crackdown on illegal surrogacy by authorities, with some commenters warning that allowing the black market to continue to operate could even normalise human organ trafficking.</p>

<p>"Life should not be traded as a commodity," one user wrote. "If this extends to the sale of organs, it will only get darker and darker, and women will have no future."</p>

<p>The incident comes a few weeks after a 28-year-old pregnant woman who acted as a surrogate in China's southwestern city of Chengdu was allegedly abandoned by her surrogacy agency.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Commonwealth of Dominica will honour Prime Minister Narendra Modi with its highest national award, the Dominica Award of Honour, in recognition of his contributions to Dominica during the COVID-19 pandemic. The award will also recognise PM Modi's dedication to strengthening the partnership between India and Dominica. Sylvanie Burton, President of the Commonwealth of Dominica will present the award during the India-CARICOM Summit in Georgetown, Guyana next week.</p>

<p>During the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, in February 2021, PM Modi supplied Dominica with 70,000 doses of the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine—"a generous gift which enabled Dominica to extend support to its Caribbean neighbours”, notes the press release issued by the Prime Minister's office.</p>

<p>Dominica appreciates India's support not just in the healthcare sector but also in education, and information technology. It also recognises India's role in promoting climate resilience-building initiatives and sustainable development on a global level.</p>

<p>“Prime Minister Modi has been a true partner to Dominica, particularly during our time of need amid a global health crisis. It is an honour to present him with Dominica's highest national accolade as a symbol of our gratitude for his support and as a reflection of the strong ties between our countries,” said PM Skerrit.</p>

<p>PM Skerrit showed interest in building on this partnership and working on the common goal of progress and resilience.</p>

<p>As per the official release, PM Modi accepted the offer of the award and emphasised the importance of collaboration in tackling global challenges such as climate change and geopolitical conflicts. PM Modi affirmed India's commitment to working alongside Dominica and the Caribbean in addressing these issues.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Locals said the disturbing find has left them traumatised, with some saying that they are now too scared to go to the beach.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A disturbing discovery was made on Key Biscayne Beach, Florida, on November 12 when a human head washed ashore. According to <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://fox8.com/news/human-head-washes-up-on-beach-in-key-biscayne-florida/">Fox News</a></em>, a beach maintenance worker found the remains near the Key Colony II Ocean Sound condos while raking the sand.&nbsp;Investigators were quickly called to the scene, and aerial helicopter footage showed them covering the remains with a blue tarp as they conducted their examination. The shocking find has sparked mystery surrounding the identity and age of the individual and the circumstances leading to the tragic event.</p>

<p>Preliminary findings suggest that the head belongs to a man, as confirmed by Miami-Dade Police Detective Andre Martin. Mr Martin noted that it's currently uncertain whether the individual was a victim of a crime or if other factors, such as a marine animal encounter or boating accident, resulted in the decapitation.</p>

<p>"We have not been able to determine exactly how the head became separated from the body, but there are a couple [of] working theories," he said.</p>

<p>Locals said the disturbing find has left them traumatised, with some saying that they are now too scared to go to the beach. Resident Bahman Amini said, "We have seen all things here but nothing like this what was found this morning, the head of a person. It makes us scared to go to the beach that we love."</p>

<p>Alex Portuondo told<em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.cbsnews.com/miami/news/miami-dade-police-investigate-report-of-head-human-on-key-biscayne-beach/">&nbsp;CBS</a></em>, "That's pretty scary and crazy. I&nbsp;have never heard of anything like this happening before on this kind of beach. I guess I am curious if they have any information on where it came from if anything else has been found if it happened here on the island or washed up on the shore."</p>

<p>''This is shocking, shocking. You don't hear a lot about that. You heard about drugs washing up on shore and things like that, but a head,''&nbsp;another resident said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The local medical examiner's office now has custody of the remains and is working to identify the person. The beach is a popular destination for tourists and locals alike.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cannabis consumption can cause damage to our body's cells and increase the risk of highly cancerous tumours, according to a new study on Thursday.</p>

<p>In the study, published in the scientific journal Addiction Biology, cannabis is described as a “genotoxic” substance because it damages a cell's genetic information. This can lead to DNA mutations, accelerated ageing, and cancer.</p>

<p>Alarmingly, this genotoxicity can be passed on to the next generation via a damaged egg and sperm -- making the risk of cannabis use trans-generational, said the researchers from the University of Western Australia.</p>

<p>In the study, the team also linked established knowledge that cannabis use damages cellular energy production by inhibiting mitochondria with recent cancer research showing that mitochondrial dysfunction drives chromosomal damage which can surge rates of cancer, accelerated ageing, and birth defects.</p>

<p>“The link we've described between cannabis use and genotoxicity has far-reaching consequences. This new research shows how genetic damage from cannabis use can be passed down the generations,” said Dr. Stuart Reece from the varsity</p>

<p>Cannabis has been known to be linked with both micronuclear development and mitochondrial inhibition for many decades.</p>

<p>Both human and rodent studies show that adult cannabis exposure is linked with the incidence of autism and cerebral processing difficulties in children prenatally exposed.</p>

<p>However, the study argued that cannabinoid genotoxicity has long been “overlooked”.</p>

<p>The researchers noted that “it may, in fact, be all around us through the rapid induction of ageing of eggs, sperm, zygotes, foetus and adult organisms with many lines of evidence demonstrating transgenerational impacts”.</p>

<p>Together, the data is clear and robust evidence for the transgenerational transmission of major genotoxic outcomes.</p>

<p>In light of this, Reece called on policymakers to “reframe the discussion surrounding cannabis legalisation from a personal choice to one that potentially involves multiple subsequent generations.”</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A YouTuber recently embarked on a new chapter of his life as a transgender man. Ash Perez, a member of the online content creators community Try Guys, documented his journey of exploration of masculinity in a video series called New Guy Tries. While some aspects of Perez's experience as a transgender man were specific to his quest to define masculinity for himself, there were moments when even his friends - some gay, some straight and cis-gendered - also shared their concepts of masculinity. They were able to sort out some of their thoughts, thanks to the series.</p>

<p>Ryan Garcia, a cisgender male cast member of the series, shared, “There was never really time to stop and reflect on where I belong in masculinity. It was just doing the things to fit in and be accepted. Being in this series with Ash was kind of a form of therapy where you stopped and actually reflected.”</p>

<p>Ash Perez's coming-out journey taught him and some of the other Try Guys a lot about masculinity and how to accept its positive aspects while pushing it beyond its conventional bounds.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Before starting his gender transition, Perez lost his father to the Covid-19 pandemic, so he had to learn how to be a man without parental supervision. He said, “It's almost impossible to figure out what manhood means in the absence of a father figure who has some knowledge or direct take on manhood.”</p>

<p>During the video series, Perez spent time talking and participating in masculine rites of passage with his male friends and coworkers on manhood and masculinity. He observed his friends found it difficult to fit into the narrow criteria society gave them. According to Perez, many of his friends and coworkers felt inadequate because the social ideal of a guy was centred around sports, meat, muscles, and earning money.</p>

<p>Perez stated one can start by looking inward if one wants to figure out how to be comfortable with one's own masculinity.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“You can have conversations with yourself. You can journal. You can begin to examine things yourself, and then start to slowly branch out in a way that feels safe for you,” he said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Want to buy a home in the United States? Well, think about it only if you earn at least $1,08,000 (around Rs 91.15 lakh) or more, a report said.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Want to buy a home in the United States? Well, think about it only if you earn at least $1,08,000 (around Rs 91.15 lakh) or more, a report said. This change, highlighted in a recent report from Oxford Economics, underscores the rapid shift in the housing market. In the third quarter of 2024, only 36% of US households had enough income to afford a new home, compared to 59% in the same period five years ago. This sharp decline reflects the challenges many Americans now face buying a property.</p>

<p>The new numbers are in stark contrast to just a few years ago. In 2019, a household needed only $56,800 (around Rs 48 lakh) to comfortably cover the cost of a new single-family home, including property taxes and insurance.</p>

<p>The massive surge in housing prices over the last five years is largely due to the disruption caused by the pandemic. During COVID-19, many Americans sought larger homes, leading to a surge in demand. Simultaneously, the country experienced a shortage of available homes, which, combined with rising demand, pushed home prices to new heights.</p>

<p>The affordability crisis is most apparent in certain cities. San Jose, California, for example, has become the least affordable metro area in the US, with a median house price of $1.89 million (around Rs 16 crore). To afford a home there, a household would need to earn $4,61,000 (Rs 3.89 crore) annually. Other major California cities such as San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego also rank among the least affordable regions.</p>

<p>Cleveland, Louisville, Detroit and St. Louis were among the more affordable cities, where households needed an income ranging from $64,600 to $75,300 (Rs 54 lakh to Rs 64 lakh) to manage housing costs.</p>

<p>Oxford Economics defines a home as affordable if the monthly payment does not exceed 28% of a person's income. “While house prices increased in every metro, the rise in mortgage rates eroded affordability more significantly as rates nearly doubled from 3.7% in Q3 2019 to a high of 7.3% in Q4 2023,” Barbara Denham, a senior economist at Oxford Economics, told <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/13/economy/home-buyer-salary-household-income/index.html">CNN</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A British society dedicated to promoting and advancing the art of magic is attempting to find its first female member. Sophie Lloyd, an actress, posed as a man named Raymond to gain entry into the Magic Circle, an all-male club. She faced expulsion from society for "deliberate deception" in 1991 after she came clean. The magic club, since, has changed its mindset about gender preferences and now wants her back, reported <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/13/uk/magic-circle-sophie-lloyd-search-intl-scli/index.html" rel="nofollow,noindex">CNN</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Lloyd was convinced to apply to the Magic Circle by her friend Jenny Winstanley, the chairperson of the Magic Circle Laura London told CNN. The "orchestrated deception" was "so brilliantly put together, almost like a heist," London claimed, adding that Lloyd trained for 18 months in magic and how to behave, dress, and sound like a man.</p>

<p>In 1989, Lloyd passed the entrance exam and gained admission to the Magic Circle disguised as a man named Raymond Lloyd. She started as an apprentice and became a full member in March 1991. In the same year, the society council finally decided to allow women to join the group after which Lloyd removed her spectacles and wig to show that she was Sophie, a 28-year-old woman.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.thetimes.com/uk/arts/article/magic-circle-wants-to-welcome-back-woman-who-duped-it-sd8ks9fvq" rel="noindex,nofollow">The Times</a> reported the council's response was "swift and severe" after realising that they had "been fooled by perhaps the greatest deception of all". Lloyd was threatened with legal action and removed from the society.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to Laura London, Lloyd kept doing magic even after expulsion and used it in a show to teach kids about bullying. But ever since, it's been "hard to find her."&nbsp;</p>

<p>She said, “I'd like to sit down and chat with her and see what happened to her. I have a feeling she was very hurt by this and I really hope that it didn't affect her ability to continue in the entertainment industry. I hope that it didn't dishearten her.”</p>

<p>London explained The Magic Circle "would all like to apologise" but more than that what they “would love to do is invite her back.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to the society's website, there are currently over 80 female members in the circle. However, this represents roughly 5% of its over 1,700-member cohort. Founded in 1905 in London's Soho district, The Magic Circle's most famous members include magician Dynamo, actor Stephen Fry and even King Charles III, who joined in 1975 while still a prince after pulling off a cups and balls trick.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[US President-elect Donald Trump has nominated Florida Senator Marco Rubio, a prominent critic of China, for the position of US Secretary of State.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President-elect Donald Trump has nominated Florida Senator <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/donald-trump-nominates-florida-senator-marco-rubio-as-secretary-of-state-7014420">Marco Rubio</a>, a prominent critic of China, for the position of US Secretary of State. In his statement, Trump praised Rubio as “a very powerful voice for freedom” and a “fearless warrior who will never back down to our adversaries.”</p>

<p><strong>Here are 5 facts about Marco Rubio and his career:&nbsp;</strong><br />
<br />
1) Early life and immigrant roots<br />
<br />
Born in 1971 in Miami, Florida, Marco Rubio is the son of Cuban immigrants who came to America in pursuit of their American Dream. His father worked as a banquet bartender, while his mother balanced being a stay-at-home mom with working as a hotel maid. From a young age, Rubio learned the values of faith, family, community, and hard work.<br />
<br />
2) A career in public service before becoming a US senator in 2010<br />
<br />
Rubio served in various roles, including as a city commissioner in West Miami and as Speaker of the Florida House of Representatives. In 2010, he won a seat in the US Senate. The Center for Effective Law Making ranked Rubio as the most effective Republican, while the Lugar Center named him one of the most bipartisan senators. His work includes expanding the child tax credit, reforming the VA system, supporting small businesses during the pandemic, reshaping US policy towards China and strengthening national security.<br />
<br />
3) 2016 Presidential bid<br />
<br />
In April 2015, Marco Rubio entered the US presidential race. Early on, he was the choice of the Republican establishment. But by February 2016, his campaign was struggling, winning just one state and trailing behind Donald Trump and Ted Cruz in the delegate count. Rubio's campaign was heavily impacted by Trump's mockery, with Trump dubbing him “Little Marco” and Rubio responding by calling Trump “the most vulgar person to ever aspire to the presidency.” After losing the Florida primary in March 2016, Rubio suspended his campaign. Though initially considering leaving politics, Rubio returned to the Senate race, winning re-election in 2016. Following Trump's victory, Rubio shifted toward a conservative populist stance, becoming a key ally of the new president.<br />
<br />
4) Legislative achievements<br />
<br />
Throughout his Senate tenure, Rubio has championed a wide range of policies aimed at improving the lives of everyday Americans. He played a key role in expanding the child tax credit for working families and reforming the US Department of Veterans Affairs, particularly securing healthcare for veterans exposed to toxic burn pits. During the pandemic lockdown, Rubio helped pass the Paycheck Protection Program, keeping millions of small businesses afloat. He also wrote and passed the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, which marked a significant shift in US-China relations.<br />
<br />
5) Family life<br />
<br />
Rubio often underlines that being a father is his most important role. He lost his own father just two months before his election to the US Senate, but his lessons of hard work, responsibility, and family continue to guide him. He met his wife, Jeanette, a fellow Miami native, through mutual friends, and they married in 1998. They have four children — Amanda, Daniella, Anthony and Dominick.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The Italian city of Florence in Tuscany is introducing new rules to address the growing problem of overtourism.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Italian city of Florence in Tuscany is introducing new rules to address the growing problem of overtourism. The measures include a ban on key boxes used by short-term rental owners and restrictions on loudspeakers used by tour guides. The key boxes, particularly in the UNESCO-listed centre, have become a source of frustration for residents, with some locals going as far as taping them up in protest.</p>

<p>As the city prepares to host G7 tourism ministers, Florence's mayor, Sarah Funaro, introduced a 10-point plan to address these concerns. The new decree also targets the increasing use of “atypical vehicles,” such as golf carts, used by tour guides to navigate areas where car traffic is restricted.</p>

<p>In a statement, Florence's council said the measures were a response to the unsustainable influx of tourists. More than 7.8 million people have visited Florence so far in 2024. “The city is no longer able to support, without weakening its heritage value and seeing its overall livability compromised, such a massive presence of activities and means for exclusive tourist use concentrated in just five square kilometres (about 2 square miles),” the city council said in the statement, reported <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/13/travel/italy-florence-bans-key-boxes-tour-guide-loudspeakers-overtourism/index.html">CNN</a>.</p>

<p>The decision follows a series of incidents that have further strained relations between locals and tourists. In one incident, a female tourist was filmed mimicking a sexual act on a statue of Bacchus. In January, the head of the Galleria dell'Accademia, Cecilie Hollberg, controversially described Florence as a “prostitute” for having succumbed to overtourism, adding that once a city becomes “a prostitute,” it is difficult to restore its original character.</p>

<p>Florence, famed for its Renaissance art and architecture, has long been a top tourist destination. In recent years, the city has seen a dramatic rise in visitor numbers, leading to concerns from residents who feel their lives were disrupted and property prices inflated. This surge in tourism has sparked a backlash, with locals demanding action to preserve the city's unique character.</p>

<p>Florence is not the only Italian destination facing the pressures of mass tourism. The archaeological site of Pompeii announced it would limit daily visitor numbers to 20,000 and introduce personalised tickets. Similarly, Venice will reintroduce an entrance fee for tourists in 2025, while Rome will implement restrictions on visitor access to the Trevi Fountain after its renovation.</p>]]></content:encoded>

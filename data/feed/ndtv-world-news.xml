       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Six people including four Pakistanis were killed and nearly 30 wounded in a shooting near a Shiite mosque in the Omani capital Muscat, officials said Tuesday, a rare attack in the otherwise stable Gulf sultanate.</p>

<p>Monday's mosque attack, which has yet to be claimed, came as Shiites this week mark Ashura, an annual day of mourning that commemorates the seventh-century death in battle of Imam Hussein, regarded by the sect as the rightful successor to the Prophet Mohammed.</p>

<p>"The Royal Oman Police have responded to a shooting incident that occurred in the vicinity of a mosque in the Al-Wadi Al-Kabir area" of the capital, a police statement said.</p>

<p>The three gunmen behind the attack were killed and police officers have "concluded the procedures for dealing with the shooting," it said.</p>

<p>It gave a death count of six killed, including a police officer. It said 28 people "from various nationalities" were wounded, including rescuers and paramedics.</p>

<p>The foreign ministry in Islamabad said at least four Pakistanis were killed.</p>

<p>"Four Pakistanis were martyred as a result of gunshots in the dastardly terrorist attack on the Ali bin Abi Talib mosque," it said in a statement.</p>

<p>"Another 30 Pakistanis are under treatment in hospitals."</p>

<p>Footage verified by AFP shows people fleeing the Imam Ali Mosque, its minaret visible, as gunshots ring out.</p>

<p>A voice can be heard saying "oh God" and repeating "oh Hussein".</p>

<p>Speaking to AFP, Pakistan's ambassador to Oman Imran Ali said the mosque was mostly frequented by south Asian expatriates. Oman is home to at least 400,000 Pakistanis, he said.</p>

<p>Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said he was "deeply saddened by the terrorist attack".</p>

<p>In a statement on social media platform X, he said: "Pakistan stands in solidarity with the Sultanate of Oman and offers full assistance in the investigation."</p>

<p><strong>Held 'hostage'</strong></p>

<p>Pakistan's ambassador said the attack started with gunfire from a building adjacent to the mosque as hundreds of people gathered for prayers.</p>

<p>The worshippers were held "hostage" by militants before "they were later freed by Omani forces", Ali told AFP.</p>

<p>He said there was little information on the perpetrators of the attack or their possible motive.</p>

<p>"Everyone is being tight-lipped about this," he said, adding that the attack created a "difficult situation".</p>

<p>Earlier on Tuesday, Ali toured hospitals treating the wounded.</p>

<p>In a video message on X, he urged Pakistanis in Oman to cooperate with the authorities and avoid the area around the mosque.</p>

<p>"We are in touch with Omani authorities as well as hospitals. Our officers are on standby for emergency blood donations in the embassy," he said, adding that a hotline has been set up to assist the wounded and their relatives.</p>

<p>The US embassy in Muscat issued a security alert following the shooting and cancelled all visa appointments for Tuesday.</p>

<p>"US citizens should remain vigilant, monitor local news and heed directions of local authorities," it posted on X.</p>

<p><strong>Investigations underway</strong></p>

<p>Police said "all necessary security measures and procedures have been taken to handle the situation" following the attack.</p>

<p>"The authorities are continuing to gather evidence and conduct investigations to uncover the circumstances surrounding the incident," police added on X.</p>

<p>The area remained cordoned off on Tuesday, with journalists unable to access the mosque, an AFP photographer reported.</p>

<p>Oman has a population of more than four million, of whom upwards of 40 percent are expat workers, mostly from south Asia, according to government figures.</p>

<p>Shiites make up a small minority of Oman's overwhelmingly Muslim population. Most Omanis follow the Sunni or Ibadi branches of the faith.</p>

<p>While several attacks on Shiite mosques have roiled the Gulf in recent years, Tuesday's attack is a first for Oman.</p>

<p>A 2015 suicide attack on a Shiite mosque in Kuwait killed at least 27 worshippers and wounded more than 200. It was claimed by the Sunni extremists of the Islamic State group.</p>

<p>The same year, Saudi Arabia saw two attacks on Shiite mosques in the space of a week, with at least 25 people killed. The attacks were again claimed by IS, which regards Shiites as heretics.</p>

<p>In 2005, a former teacher opened fire inside a government building in Muscat, killing two people and wounding several others, before shooting himself.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The health ministry said an Israeli strike on a fuel station in Al-Mawasi in southern Gaza killed 17 people and wounded at least 26. The Palestinian Red Crescent initially gave a death count of eight dead in a separate strike at almost the same time on the UN-run Al-Razi School in the Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza, but this was quickly revised down to five dead.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The event marked Donald Trump's first public appearance since the an assassination attempt at a Pennsylvania rally.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A video circulating on social media appears to show former US President Donald Trump dozing off during the Republican National Convention on Monday. According to a report in <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.newsweek.com/did-trump-fall-asleep-rnc-convention-1925683"><em>Newsweek</em></a>, the now-viral clip was shot during Harmeet Dhillon's address. Mr Trump can be seen nodding off while JD Vance, his running mate, is seen next to him with his eyes open. Notably, the event marked his first public appearance since the assassination attempt at a Pennsylvania rally.</p>

<p>The footage was shared by several users on X (formerly Twitter). Since being shared, the post has amassed over 2.5 million views and 34,000 likes.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-media-max-width="560">

<p>"Sleepy Don," said a user.</p>

<p>Another commented, "wakey wakey donald!"</p>

<p>A third person said, "Bro really? How much sleep you think this man has gotten in 48 hours?"</p>

<p>An X user stated, "He literally just, by the grace of God, lived through an assassination attempt.. he then flew out to see his doctors and family, met with politicians, flew back for the RNC (let alone everything we don't see in the background he has had to do to ensure another attempt isn't made)"</p>

<p>"He's probably on super strong pain pills. Just a thought," remarked a user.</p>

<p>As per <em>CBS News</em>, Donald Trump's eyes were closed, not because he was asleep, but because the video was apparently taken during Pastor James Roemke's prayer. Mr Trump and JD Vance were among the large number of people in the crowd who had their eyes closed throughout the pastor's prayer. Some individuals uploaded Roemke's prayer video incorrectly, saying that Mr Trump was sleeping at the moment by editing out other audience members whose eyes were also closed.</p>

<p>The event has sparked a debate as Mr Trump frequently mocks US President Joe Biden, referring to him as "Sleepy Joe," to question his fitness for office. Notably, Mr Biden is the oldest president in American history at 81. Donald Trump said that the POTUS "almost fell asleep" on stage after his heavily criticised performance at the first presidential debate in Atlanta.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in April, several journalists stated that the 78-year-old appeared to doze off several times during his criminal trial in New York, prompting Mr Biden to call him "Sleepy Don." However, Mr Trump denied falling asleep in the courtroom. The campaign told the <em>Independent</em>, "This is 100% Fake News coming from 'journalists' who weren't even in the court room."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JD Vance, Donald Trump's vice presidential pick, has the support of former Trump presidential primary rival Vivek Ramaswamy.</p>

<p>Reminiscing the days of his law school, Mr Ramaswamy, an Indian-American entrepreneur, underscored how impressed he is with his "classmate" JD Vance getting the "strongest presidential ticket."</p>

<p>"So proud of my friend, classmate, and fellow southwest Ohioan today. We used to watch Bengals games at the bar in law school, it's awesome we're now here a decade later with JD joining the strongest presidential ticket in our lifetime," said Mr Ramaswamy.</p>

<p>"He'll be an outstanding Vice President and I look forward to everything ahead for him and for our country," Mr Ramaswamy added, who dropped out of the 2024 Republican presidential race after finishing fourth in the Iowa caucuses earlier.</p>

<p>Donald Trump won the formal nomination Monday as the Republican presidential candidate and picked a right-wing loyalist for his running mate, kicking off a triumphalist party convention in the wake of the weekend's failed assassination attempt.</p>

<p>A White House candidate often chooses a vice presidential running mate who can appeal to new categories of voters or compensate for acknowledged weaknesses in terms of image or policy.</p>

<p>Even if his octogenarian rival Joe Biden appears to be suffering more than him from advanced age, Trump knows he is no spring chicken at 78.</p>

<p>By picking Mr Vance, who at 39 is barely half Trump's age -- and the first millennial on a major US party presidential ticket -- he could neutralize what had been the relatively youthful advantage of Biden's vice president, 59-year-old Kamala Harris.</p>

<p>Mr Vance, who was once a fierce Trump antagonist, has made a U-turn to establish himself as one of the billionaire's most ardent defenders.</p>

<p>He has deleted earlier tweets critical of Trump and instead passionately embraced his ideas, advocating a radical anti-immigration fight and uncompromising economic protectionism.</p>

<p>Vance's 2016 memoir "Hillbilly Elegy" was extolled by some as a window into the lives and troubles of the white working class -- and their support for Trump.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ian Cameron, former Rolls-Royce head designer and vintage car expert, was killed at his $3 million mansion in Germany after getting stabbed by a man during a robbery attempt.</p>

<p>The 74-year-old British national was living with his wife Verena Kloos in Germany's Herrsching at Lake Ammersee during the incident. Ms Kloos escaped the attack by scaling a wall and landing in her neighbour's house, from where she informed the cops.</p>

<p>The power cables to the garage of Ian Cameron's house, where valuables were kept, had been purposefully cut off, according to CCTV evidence.</p>

<p>"The investigation suggests that this was a violent crime," said police officials.</p>

<p>Ian Cameron played a "significant" role in the designing of iconic Rolls-Royce vehicles like the Ghost, Phantom, and 3 Series.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ian Cameron undertook the role of leading the Rolls-Royce design team after BMW acquired Rolls-Royce's automotive business in 1998.</p>

<p>"We are deeply shocked and saddened by the news about our former Rolls-Royce designer. Our thoughts are with his family and friends during these difficult hours," said BMW in a statement to Automotive News. &nbsp;</p>

<p>"Ian played a significant role in shaping Rolls-Royce from when it was first acquired by BMW Group and moved to its home at Goodwood, West Sussex. During Ian's tenure, he led the design team for all Phantom family and Ghost models, creating thoroughly contemporary motor cars that remained sympathetic to the marque's design lineage," the automaker added.</p>

<p>The suspect's height is estimated to be between 180 and 190 cm (5 ft 9 in to 6 ft 2 in). He is wearing light-colored pants, a dark-blue sweatshirt, yellow-green gloves, and a red backpack, according to a description by police officials.</p>

<p>A manhunt has been launched to locate the suspect who is currently on the run. Dogs and a helicopter are helping search teams thoroughly examine the area to catch the murderer.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-07/bq88p95_trump-shooting_625x300_16_July_24.jpg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>The recent visuals of the shooting at a rally for Donald Trump and the injury he suffered have sent shockwaves across the globe, including India. There is no place for this kind of violence in a democratic society. Both India and the US share a deep commitment to democratic values, and it is this shared commitment that brings us closer together. As an Indian, I find it deeply troubling to witness such acts of violence in a country that has long been a beacon of democracy and freedom. The incident at the Trump rally, where shots were fired and chaos ensued, highlighted a grim reality-that gun violence can strike at the very heart of democracy.</p>

<p>India and the US have much in common. Both nations are built on the foundation of democratic principles and have a long history of upholding the rule of law and human rights. Our countries have thrived on the strength of our diverse societies and the resilience of our democratic institutions. India, the world's largest democracy, has faced its own challenges, but we have always strived to maintain peace and order within our borders. The U.S., as the world's oldest democracy, has been a role model for nations around the globe. This deep respect and commonality of democratic values make it all the more essential for us to address issues that threaten these values.</p>

<h2><strong>America's Social Issues</strong></h2>

<p>While it is yet to be fully understood what actually transpired at the rally and why it happened, this incident highlights the urgent need to address underlying societal issues in the US. As someone who believes in the promise of American democracy, I am compelled to speak out. It is high time that America takes decisive action on gun control.</p>

<p>The issue of gun control has been a topic of national debate in the US for decades. Since the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in 1963, there have been numerous calls for stricter gun laws. Despite these calls, little has been done to address the root causes. The tragic incidents at malls, schools, hospitals, and other public places have instilled fear not only in the hearts of Americans but also in the global community. The perception of safety in America has been significantly altered, and this is a matter of grave concern.</p>

<p>According to data from the Gun Violence Archive, there were over 600 mass shootings in the US in 2022 alone. The country has one of the highest rates of gun violence in the world, with more than 45,000 gun-related deaths reported in the same year. These figures are alarming and underscore the urgent need for comprehensive gun control measures. The Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which protects the right to bear arms, has been interpreted in ways that allow for widespread gun ownership. However, it is crucial to balance this right with the need to ensure public safety.</p>

<h2><strong>The Powerful Gun Lobby</strong></h2>

<p>One of the key reasons for the lack of significant gun control legislation in the US is the powerful lobby of arms manufacturers. The National Rifle Association (NRA) and other pro-gun organisations have a significant influence on American politics. Their lobbying efforts have thwarted numerous attempts to pass meaningful gun control laws. It is imperative to question whether the freedom to own guns is genuinely about protecting individual liberties or whether it is driven by the interests of the arms industry.</p>

<p>Many other democracies around the world have implemented strict gun control measures with positive results. Countries like Australia, the UK, and Japan have shown that it is possible to significantly reduce gun violence through sensible legislation. These nations have demonstrated that public safety can be prioritised without infringing on individual freedoms.</p>

<p>The US must acknowledge that the world is changing. There is an increasing number of people dealing with mental health issues and other personal struggles. In the absence of adequate support systems, some individuals may resort to violence as a means of expression. The availability of guns only exacerbates this problem, leading to tragic consequences that leave lasting scars on families and communities.</p>

<h2><strong>For The People And Society</strong></h2>

<p>As a citizen of India, a friendly democracy, I appeal to the greater conscience of the American people, political leaders, and society at large. It is time to enforce gun control measures that will protect innocent lives. The time to act is now. How many more lives must be lost before meaningful change is implemented?</p>

<p>In conclusion, the US stands at a crossroads. The decisions made today will shape the future of the nation. It is imperative to prioritise the safety and well-being of all citizens. By enacting comprehensive gun control measures, America can demonstrate its commitment to democratic values. As a friend and admirer of American democracy, I urge the US to take bold steps towards a safer and more just society.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[According to Google Analytics, on the day when Mr Trump was shot during a rally in Butler, the search term 'American Civil War' reached a 12-month high.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former US President Donald Trump was hit in the ear in an apparent assassination attempt by a gunman at a campaign rally today in Pennsylvania on Saturday, a shocking incident that will fuel fears of instability ahead of the 2024 US presidential election. Several politicians, tech leaders and followers of Mr Trump condemned the attack, stressing that political violence is intolerable. Amid this, terms such as 'Civil War 2' and 'American Civil War' spiked on Google search, as per a report in the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/07/15/us-news/panicked-search-terms-spike-online-after-trump-rally-shooting-civil-war-2/"><em>New York Post.</em></a></p>

<p>According to Google Analytics, on the day when Mr Trump was shot during a rally in Butler, the search term 'American Civil War' reached a 12-month high. Additionally, the day also saw the highest increase in interest in the term 'Secret Service' during the previous five years. The day following the incident witnessed new 12-month highs for the terms 'long-distance shooting' and 'gun store near me,' which both had notable interest surges. At the same time, 'How do I move to Canada' also hit a record 12-month high.</p>

<p>Google Analytics tracks the total amount of interest in a word rather than each individual usage- the term with the most searches during a specific time period (100 points) is at the top of the list, while the term with the fewest searches (0 points) is at the bottom. Within moments of the incident, 'Civil War' soon became the most searched phrase on the platform.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the 78-year-old Republican presidential contender, whose team claimed he was "fine," was attacked shortly as he began his speech."I knew immediately that something was wrong in that I heard a whizzing sound, shots, and immediately felt the bullet ripping through the skin," Mr Trump said on his Truth Social account.</p>

<p>He added, "Much bleeding took place, so I realized then what was happening." Earlier in the statement, he stated, "I was shot with a bullet that pierced the upper part of my right ear."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the FBI identified the shooter in the assassination attempt on the former president as 20-year-old <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/donald-trump-rally-shooting-who-was-thomas-matthew-crooks-man-who-tried-to-assassinate-donald-trump-6102487">Thomas Matthew Crooks</a>. The US Secret Service said in a statement that the shooter "fired multiple shots toward the stage from an elevated position outside the rally" before being "neutralized" by agents. He was registered as a Republican, according to the state's voter records.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former US President Donald Trump recently shared details about the dramatic moment he was shot at and rushed off stage by Secret Service agents. Amid the chaos, the 78-year-old was heard, saying, "Wait, I want to get my shoes."</p>

<p>Describing the experience as "very surreal," the former President clarified the mystery surrounding his shoes in a recent interview. “The agents struck me that my shoes fell off,” Trump revealed, as per the <a href="http://https://nypost.com/2024/07/14/us-news/grateful-defiant-trump-recounts-surreal-assassination-attempt-at-rally-im-supposed-to-be-dead/ ">NY Post</a>. “And my shoes are tight.”</p>

<p>The Republican nominee narrowly escaped an assassination attempt at a rally in Pennsylvania on Sunday.</p>

<p>The former president recounted the incident, saying had he not turned his head slightly to the right to read a chart, he would be dead by now. At that moment, a bullet grazed Trump's ear, tearing off a small piece and splattering blood on his forehead and cheek. Secret Service agents swiftly jumped in, screaming at him to “get down” and tackled him to the ground like “linebackers” before rushing him to a hospital. Trump even showed off a bruise on his arm from where they grabbed him.</p>

<p>This close call has left many shaken. But Trump is grateful to be alive. He said that medical professionals told him he was “supposed to be dead", sharing&nbsp;that the doctor at the hospital described his survival as a "miracle." The doctor also stated that he had never seen anyone survive after being hit by an AR-15 rifle.</p>

<p>Donald Trump praised the Secret Service for quickly taking down the shooter, who was 130 yards away on a roof. He described the agents' actions as “fantastic” and said they did a great job. He even pointed to his nose to show where they hit the shooter.</p>

<p>The former president also talked about the iconic photo of him raising his fist and saying "fight" as the agents tried to get him to safety. He joked that people usually “have to die” to get such an iconic photo.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Palestinian Embassy on Tuesday thanked India as it released the first tranche of USD 2.5 million to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) as a part of its annual contribution at USD 5 Million for the year 2024-2025.</p>

<p>The embassy said we extend our sincere thanks and appreciation to the Indian Government for releasing the first tranche of USD 2.5 million to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East as a part of its annual contribution at USD 5 Million for the year 2024-2025.</p>

<p>We also followed with great interest India's pledge of support to UNRWA during the UNRWA conference held in New York and announced that in addition to financial assistance, New Delhi will provide medicines to UNRWA upon request, it said.</p>

<p>This Indian assistance and this pledge an important step to support and strengthen the role of UNRWA in the face of attempts to target its role and existence by the Israeli government</p>

<p>While we appreciate the Indian contribution to UNRWA, we believe that this assistance, whether financial or medical, constitutes an important part of the assistance provided to the Palestinian people in various fields, which we look forward to increasing during the next stage due to the urgent need due to the Israeli war on Gaza, which has created a new and dangerous reality.</p>

<p>About 2.2 million Palestinians were residing in the Gaza Strip an area of 365 km2, representing about 41% of the population of Palestine. Most of this population (about 66%) are refugees, about 2 million Palestinians left their homes out of about 2.2 million Palestinians who were residing in the Gaza Strip on the eve of the Israeli occupation aggression, the statement said.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) is facing Israeli plans to target the body of the United Nations Foundation, which witnesses the case of more than 6 million Palestinian refugees and provides services to them in its five areas of operation (Gaza Strip, West Bank, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon).</p>

<p>We hope that India, through its bilateral relationship with the pillars of the international community and through its effective position in many important political and economic blocs and groupings around the world, will work to preserve UNRWA and strengthen its status and role, for which it was founded in 1949, and that Israeli attempts to replace it with other institutions will fail.</p>

<p>The importance of UNRWA for Palestinians goes beyond access to vital services, as they see its existence as linked to the preservation of their rights as refugees, especially their hope to return to their homes from which they or their ancestors were expelled during the Nakba.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on Tuesday reaffirmed India's consistent and continued support to Mauritius in its quest for progress and prosperity.</p>

<p>Mr Jaishankar is in Mauritius for a two-day visit for "productive engagements" with the leadership of Mauritius to take forward the special bilateral ties.</p>

<p>The visit to the Indian Ocean island nation marks one of the first bilateral engagements undertaken by Mr Jaishankar following his re-appointment in the third term of Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led government.</p>

<p>"India's ties with Mauritius have blossomed into a robust and multifaceted partnership. The bilateral relation with Mauritius serves as a role model for India's successful development collaboration abroad," Mr Jaishankar said at an event attended by Mauritius Prime Minister Pravind Jugnauth.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Honored to call on PM <a href="https://twitter.com/KumarJugnauth?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@KumarJugnauth</a> today in Port Louis. Conveyed the warm greetings of PM <a href="https://twitter.com/narendramodi?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@narendramodi</a>.<br />

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>The event saw the inauguration of 12 High Impact Community Development Projects that are funded by India, the exchange of MoUs on education, culture, digitisation of Immigration Archives and collaboration in the field of space and innovation.</p>

<p>Mr Jaishankar and Mr Jugnauth also handed over OCI cards to seventh-generation Indian-origin people in Mauritius.</p>

<p>The visit underscores the importance of the India-Mauritius relationship and is a reflection of India's 'Neighbourhood First Policy', Vision SAGAR, and commitment to the Global South.</p>

<p>According to the Indian High Commission at Mauritius website, India has close, long-standing relations with Mauritius, an island nation in the Western Indian Ocean, owing to historical, demographic and cultural reasons.</p>

<p>A key reason for the special ties is the fact that Indian-origin people comprise nearly 70 per cent of the island's population of 1.2 million, it added.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-07/onflnjc_indian-origin_625x300_16_July_24.jpg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>Donald Trump's defiant act of pumping his fist in the air, moments after his brush with death, could potentially sink President Joe Biden's chances of victory in the November election. Democrats may disagree, but it has certainly relegated Biden's age concerns to the background. At least for now. The 81-year-old President's mental and physical fitness issue is bound to resurface in the coming days and weeks, leading up to the Democratic Party Convention on August 19-22 in Chicago, when the party candidate will officially be announced.</p>

<p>If Biden, who has remained defiant so far, decides to withdraw from the race, a prominent alternative being considered is Vice-President Kamala Harris.</p>

<h2><strong>Harris and Her Indian Heritage</strong></h2>

<p>Harris, half Indian by heritage, has a familial connection to Thulasendrapuram in Tamil Nadu. Her family from her mother's side come from there. Her appointment in 2020 was celebrated with fireworks and prayers in India, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi calling it a "historic occasion" and expressing his eagerness to work with her to strengthen India-US relations.</p>

<p>Despite the initial excitement, it is clear that the strengthening of India-US relations under Biden's administration has been driven by the President's initiatives rather than Harris's Indian heritage. While Harris often speaks about her Indian roots, her policies and actions are primarily shaped by the strategic interests of the United States, not India.</p>

<h2><strong>The Political Strategy of Indian-Origin Politicians</strong></h2>

<p>A few Indian-origin politicians in the US, such as Nikki Haley and Bobby Jindal, tend to downplay their Indian heritage to appeal to broader voter bases, which can be seen as a political strategy.&nbsp;<br />
In the UK, Indian-origin politicians like Priti Patel and Suella Braverman, despite their immigrant backgrounds, have adopted strict anti-immigrant stances, aligning with conservative values to secure support within their parties.</p>

<p>Rishi Sunak's appointment as the UK Prime Minister in 2022 sparked significant excitement among Indians. I met jubilant members of the Indian community in Southampton, Sunak's hometown, who felt immense pride. However, their enthusiasm later dampened as they realised that Sunak's policies were driven by the priorities of the UK, not his Indian heritage. He turned out to be just another politician who was co-opted by the establishment, they felt.</p>

<h2><strong>Symbolism vs. Substance</strong></h2>

<p>The celebrations over Indian-origin politicians achieving high office in Western countries often overlook the reality that these leaders primarily serve the interests of their respective countries. For instance, Sunak's policies were guided by national interests rather than ethnic connections, as evidenced by the stalled Free Trade Agreement (FTA) talks between the UK and India.</p>

<p>Similar cases include Antonio Costa and Leo Varadkar, former Prime Ministers of Portugal and Ireland, respectively, whose political actions did not necessarily favour India. Costa, with Goan roots, and Varadkar, with Maharashtrian heritage, focused on their countries' priorities, not their ancestral ties.</p>

<p>For the Indian diaspora, the rise of leaders like Sunak, Harris, Costa, and Varadkar is a source of inspiration and pride, demonstrating that individuals of Indian descent can achieve the highest political offices in foreign lands. However, the tangible benefits for the diaspora are limited. For example, the Indian community in Southampton has become divided over whether Sunak's premiership has provided any real advantages.</p>

<h2><strong>Starmer's Cabinet And Lack Of Diversity&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p>In the recent UK elections, a record 26 MPs of Indian origin were elected, with 19 from Labour, including 12 Sikhs and six female Sikh MPs. Despite this representation, the Indian community was disappointed that only one half-Indian MP received a senior ministerial position in Prime Minister Keir Starmer's cabinet. This cabinet appears predominantly white, a stark contrast to Boris Johnson's diverse 2019 cabinet.</p>

<p>The Biden administration has appointed around 130 Indian-Americans to key positions, reflecting the growing influence and integration of Indian-Americans in US politics. While these appointments are a source of pride and potentially facilitate stronger India-US relations, the primary allegiance of these officials is to the US.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Indian diaspora is indeed an influential group in many countries, which can be leveraged to India's advantage. That explains why diaspora outreach is one of PM Modi's key foreign policy priorities.&nbsp;<br />
The Modi government has also been advocating for more representations for India at influential global institutions, such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank, and important United Nations (UN) bodies. If we have more Indians or Indian-origin people in key positions in these institutions, it will surely bring more prestige and power to India.</p>

<h2><strong>Indian-Origin CEOs in Global IT Firms</strong></h2>

<p>Apart from politics, Indian-origin CEOs of global IT firms, such as Sundar Pichai of Google and Satya Nadella of Microsoft, bring indirect benefits to India. They foster stronger business ties, create job opportunities, invest in Indian startups, and promote technology and education initiatives. Their success elevates India's global standing in the tech world.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that the achievements of Indian-origin politicians and business leaders in Western countries or anywhere else are commendable and a source of pride, but it is important to maintain a realistic perspective on their impact. Their primary duty is to serve the interests of their respective countries, and their policies are shaped by the political and strategic priorities of those nations. The symbolic importance of their success does not necessarily translate into tangible benefits for India or the Indian diaspora.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So, in case Biden withdraws from the race and Kamala Harris replaces him I am sure people in India, more particularly in Tamil Nadu, will feel proud. But do not expect any favours from her if she wins. If Trump comes back to power we are bound to remember neither President Biden nor Kamala Harris.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The assassination attempt on Donald Trump has forced Joe Biden's campaign to dial down its attacks for now, with the US president admitting he was wrong to say his rival should be put in the "bullseye."</p>

<p>But Biden has more broadly defended his rhetoric describing his Republican predecessor as a threat to democracy, and is signaling he will not hold back for long while criticizing the man he beat in 2020.</p>

<p>When Biden urged Americans to "lower the temperature" in a rare Oval Office speech on Sunday after the Trump shooting, it seemed it could deprive him of his core attack line.</p>

<p>Just last week the 81-year-old had tried to pivot his campaign back on to his Republican rival, following weeks of turmoil in the Democratic Party over his age and health after a disastrous debate performance.</p>

<p>In the light of the Trump attack, Biden told broadcaster NBC on Monday that was a "mistake" to say in a call with donors a week ago that it was "time to put Trump in the bullseye."&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Democrat said he had meant that the party should "focus on what he's doing" instead of calling him to quit after the debate.</p>

<p>Republicans have pointed to the bullseye comment in particular as they accuse Biden himself of creating the political conditions that led a shooter to try to kill Trump -- ignoring their own candidate's history of encouraging violence.</p>

<p>But while Biden's campaign has toned down its language in the immediate aftermath of the shooting, Biden himself hinted that he would not hold back.</p>

<p>"How do you talk about the threat to democracy, which is real, when a president says things like he says. Do you just not say anything because it may incite somebody?" he told NBC.</p>

<p>"I have not engaged in that rhetoric. Now my opponent has engaged in that rhetoric, he talks about how there'll be a bloodbath when he loses."</p>

<p>He also slammed Trump for pledging to pardon those involved in the January 6, 2021 Capitol attack by pro-Trump supporters and for joking about former US House speaker Nancy Pelosi's husband being attacked with a hammer.</p>

<h3><strong>'Changes the calculus'</strong></h3>

<p>Facing repeated questions over Biden's comment at a White House briefing, Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said it was "OK to speak to someone's record, speak to someone's character."</p>

<p>Despite canceling a trip to Texas on Monday, Biden is continuing with a planned visit to the battleground state of Nevada, setting up a split-screen with Trump's convention appearances.</p>

<p>In an opinion piece in the Washington Post, political columnist Karen Tumulty wrote that there could "hardly be a worse moment for Biden to be compelled to redraw his strategy against Trump."</p>

<p>The Trump shooting could, however, help Biden as he fights for his own political survival.</p>

<p>"Obviously this changes the calculus for people calling for Biden to stand down," Peter Loge, a political scientist at George Washington University, told AFP.</p>

<p>"It buys Biden some time."</p>

<p>The Democratic meltdown over Biden's age following the debate had dominated the airwaves for weeks, but with the gunshots on Saturday the revolt over his candidacy fell abruptly silent.</p>

<p>Biden has also sought to strike a presidential tone over the shooting, coming out quickly to react on Saturday and addressing the nation Sunday in just the third Oval Office speech of his presidency.</p>

<p>But if the shooting could unify Democrats, it could also doom Biden's reelection bid, with the president already behind in most polls.</p>

<p>Iconic images of a bloodied Trump waving his fist after the shooting are already galvanizing Republican hopes that voters will further rally behind him for a landslide victory in November.</p>

<p>Loge, however, said there may be little effect as "a lot of voters see Trump as too nuts and Biden as too old, and an assassination attempt doesn't change that."</p>

<p>He added that focusing on the immediate impact of the shooting on the campaigns was the "wrong question" and missed the wider need to tackle the threats and violence plaguing US politics.</p>

<p>"If we make political violence part of a campaign strategy we miss the point of political violence, and we end up kind of normalizing it," he said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President Joe Biden is on the brink of failing to win a key labor endorsement as leaders of the 1.3 million-member Teamsters union consider backing no candidate at all in the US presidential race, according to two people familiar with the matter.</p>

<p>The International Brotherhood of Teamsters decision has not been finalized and is expected to be made in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>Not backing Biden, who the union endorsed in 2020, would compound political damage to the Democratic president's reelection bid.</p>

<p>A Teamsters endorsement for Republican candidate Donald Trump appears unlikely, sources say, but deep internal divisions mean the union may not back any candidate at all. That would mark the first time since 1996, according to news reports.</p>

<p>Since his halting performance in a presidential debate on June 27, Biden has already seen a number of lawmakers and donors ask him to stand aside, worried about his ability to get reelected and to serve another four-year term. Some allies say they believe Saturday's Trump assassination attempt could quiet those calls, but other Democrats doubt that.</p>

<p>Biden's team once viewed the Teamsters endorsement as all but inevitable and still counts a number of senior leaders there as supporters. But months of deteriorating relations and rising concerns about Biden's political endurance have soured sentiment among some of the leaders at the union, which represents workers in fields ranging from trucking to manufacturing and office work.</p>

<p>"No final decision has been made," said Kara Deniz, a spokesperson for the Teamsters, adding that any reporting that suggests an outcome is speculative.</p>

<p>Teamsters President Sean O'Brien spoke at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee on Monday night, where he offered no endorsement but thanked Trump profusely for opening the convention doors to him. He praised the former president as tough and attacked Washington as being run in a way that hurts working people.</p>

<p>He also praised Trump's running mate JD Vance as one of several lawmakers that "truly care about working people."</p>

<p>"We are not beholden to anyone or any party," O'Brien said on stage, as Trump watched.</p>

<p>"The Teamsters are not interested if you have a 'D,' 'R' or an 'I' next your name. We want to know one thing: what are you doing to help American workers?"</p>

<p>O'Brien is not yet scheduled to speak at the Democratic convention in August.</p>

<p>The Teamsters leader had reached out simultaneously to the Democratic and Republican national committees to speak at their conventions but only heard back from Republicans, Deniz told Reuters.</p>

<p>A person familiar with the planning of the Democratic convention said no final decisions had been made about their programming.</p>

<p>"We are building a convention in Chicago that will tell our story to the American people, including the stories of labor and union leaders and workers that President Biden has been delivering for as the most pro-union president in modern history," said convention spokesperson Matt Hill.</p>

<h3><strong>BIDEN, CLINTON, OBAMA</strong></h3>

<p>The Teamsters, founded in 1903, endorsed Biden in 2020, as well as Democrats Hillary Clinton in 2016 and Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012, though they have sometimes picked Republicans in earlier elections.</p>

<p>The group's frustrations with Biden's team have mounted in recent months. On one key priority, rescuing trucking giant Yellow Corp and its 30,000 union jobs from bankruptcy, O'Brien sought and was denied an Oval Office meeting to discuss the issue with Biden, according to one of the people familiar with the matter.</p>

<p>The White House did not respond to a request for comment.</p>

<p>Those frustrations were compounded as some Democratic lawmakers and donors have since the debate called for Biden to drop his reelection bid and open the door for another candidate, another person familiar with the union's deliberations said.</p>

<p>Last week, United Auto Workers President Shawn Fain met with that union's executive board to discuss his concerns over Biden's ability to defeat Trump.</p>

<p>Working-class groups helped power Biden's 2020 election victory in closely contested states such as Michigan, Pennsylvania and Nevada.</p>

<p>Union groups encourage their members to vote, volunteer and donate to campaigns, and they form a particularly important source of cash and labor for Democratic presidential campaigns.</p>

<p>In return, they expect policies that increase union jobs, wages and make it easier to collectively bargain contracts with employers. Biden's gestures have included a $36 billion bailout of a union pension fund that prevented cuts to the income of over 350,000 Teamsters union workers and retirees.</p>

<p>Across many unions, rank-and-file workers are more divided about Democrats than their leadership, and Trump has actively courted workers' support.</p>

<p>The Teamsters held roundtables with Trump and Biden this year and hosted some 300 local events with workers to gauge their opinions on the race.</p>

<p>Charles Lutvak, a Biden campaign spokesperson, said the campaign had drawn vast union support reflecting Biden's "record of delivering results for working families while Donald Trump delivers for his wealthy donors and himself."</p>

<p>He said Biden is "a champion for working people over greedy corporations - whether they vote for him or not."</p>

<p>O'Brien has said the union would conduct polling and likely make a decision on an endorsement after the parties' conventions have concluded next month.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former US President Donald Trump narrowly escaped an assassination attempt at a campaign rally on Saturday.&nbsp;The 78-year-old Republican had just started his speech during at the event in Butler, Pennsylvania when the shots rang out and one of the bullets grazed his ear.</p>

<p>A video is now going viral that shows a woman sitting right behind Donald Trump acting strange -&nbsp; moments after the shooting.</p>

<p>The video shows the woman - wearing sunglasses, a white shirt and a black hat - ducking and pulling out her phone as the shots rang out.</p>

<p>One user also pointed out that she was looking in the direction of the snipers.</p>

<p>The viral video has added fuel to several conspiracy theories doing rounds on social media following the shooting incident.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">This video of a woman located behind Donald Trump during his attempted assassination is HIGHLY suspicious.<br />
<br />
Her body language &amp; behavior seem to indicate she knew that something was coming. <a href="https://t.co/L4sEHArSrA">pic.twitter.com/L4sEHArSrA</a></p>
— Dominic Michael Tripi (@DMichaelTripi) <a href="https://twitter.com/DMichaelTripi/status/1812659285039501385?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 15, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p></p>

<p>Several people on social media called her behaviour "highly suspicious, while others opined it could be a "harmless coincidence".</p>

<p>A moment of terrifying political violence at the rally instantly turned into a piece of Donald Trump iconography that's likely to turbocharge his presidential bid.</p>

<p>Images of a defiant Trump - with his fist raised over his head and his bloody right ear, as Secret Service agents surround him and the American flag waving in the background - are blazing across social media and television.</p>

<p>Applause and cheering spread through the grounds as Trump, clearly dazed, pumped his fist and waved through the linked arms of his security detail at the stunned crowd.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk has rejected a report claiming that he plans to give $45 million a month to a new super political-action committee (PAC) supporting former US President Donald Trump's presidential run, calling it "fake."<br />
<br />
In a sarcastic post on X, Elon Musk posted a picture of two gnus (wildebeest) having human limbs and captioned it, "Fake GNUS." He even shared The Wall Street Journal's report on X.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="qme"><a href="https://t.co/RJdF7MWeEi">pic.twitter.com/RJdF7MWeEi</a></p>
— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1813097084595163643?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 16, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p></p>

<p>His statement comes after The Wall Street Journal, citing people familiar with the matter, reported that Musk plans to give USD 45 million a month to a new super political-action committee supporting Trump's presidential run.</p>

<p>America PAC, formed in June, is focused on registering voters and urging constituents to vote early and request mail-in ballots in swing states, according to one of the people.</p>

<p>The coalition assessed that the Democrats have historically had very robust "get out the vote" campaigns and took note of the money that the Biden camp has dedicated to so-called on-the-ground efforts in swing states. America PAC will attempt to counter that, according to The Wall Street Journal Street.</p>

<p>Currently, Musk is the world's richest person, with an estimated fortune of more than USD 250 billion. For its efforts, America PAC has hired a number of employees and has been registering voters, holding discussions with constituents in swing states and urging voters to request mail-in ballots, according to some of the people familiar with the matter, the report said.</p>

<p>According to a filing made on Monday, America PAC had USD 8.75 million in contributions for the three-month duration, which ended on June 30, The Wall Street Journal stated.</p>

<p>Earlier in March, Elon Musk, in a post on X, said that he did not intend to make donations to the campaigns of Trump or US President Joe Biden. However, the Tesla CEO has gotten closer to Donald Trump in recent months, The Wall Street Journal reported.</p>

<p>On Saturday, Musk formally announced support for Trump after a shooter tried to assassinate the former US President at a rally in Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>In a post on X, Musk stated, "I fully endorse President Trump and hope for his rapid recovery." In a subsequent post, he stated, "Last time America had a candidate this tough was Theodore Roosevelt."</p>

<p>Trump was on stage at a campaign rally on Saturday when gunshots rang out and Secret Service agents stormed the stage.</p>

<p>Hours after the shooting, Trump said that the bullet pierced the upper part of his right ear. In addition, one of the rally attendee was killed and two others were injured in the shooting at the event.</p>

<p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) identified the gunman as Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20, from Bethel Park, Pennsylvania, with the case continuing to be under investigation.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The wife of the firefighter, who was killed during an attack at a Donald Trump rally, received a call from President Joe Biden after the tragedy struck her family on Saturday. Helen Comperatore, however, did not talk to Biden and said Trump hadn't reached out, reported New York Post.</p>

<p>"I didn't talk to Biden. I didn't want to talk to him. My husband was a devout Republican and he would not have wanted me to talk to him," said Corey Comperatore's wife.</p>

<p>Corey, father of two children, was shot by a sniper's bullet during the assassination attempt on Trump during a rally in Pennsylvania. Trump survived the attack but a bullet pierced his right ear. He was seen with a bloodied face with his fist in the air as the Secret Service agents bundled him to safety.</p>

<p>When the shots were heard, Corey shouted "Get down" and shielded his family from the bullets with his body. He died while two other rallygoers were wounded in the chaos.</p>

<p>His wife, Helen, said though Trump hadn't contacted her, Biden's call wasn't welcome.</p>

<p>"I don't have any ill will towards Joe Biden. I'm not one of those people that gets involved in politics. I support Trump. That's who I'm voting for, but I don't have ill will towards Biden. He didn't do anything bad to my husband. A 20-year-old despicable kid did," she said.</p>

<p>The gunman who targeted Trump was identified as Thomas Mathew Crooks, a 20-year-old. He was shot dead by snipers on the spot. The FBI, which is probing the assassination bid, is still trying to find motive behind the attack.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel's deadly strike on Al-Mawasi, one of the bloodiest attacks in more than nine months of the war in Gaza, used massive payload bombs provided by the United States, according to weapons experts.</p>

<p>The bombing of the Israeli-declared "safe zone" transformed the tent city on the Mediterranean coast into a charred wasteland, with nearby hospitals overrun with casualties.</p>

<p>According to the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory, the barrage killed at least 92 people and wounded more than 300.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said it targeted two "masterminds" of the October 7 attacks by Hamas that triggered the war. It said a top commander, Rafa Salama, was killed in the strike, but uncertainty remains over Hamas military chief Mohammed Deif.</p>

<p>AFP videos of the attack showed a white mushroom cloud billowing over a busy street, leaving behind a huge crater strewn with the wreckage of tents and a building blown to bits.</p>

<p>Here is what we know about the weaponry used in the attack:</p>

<h3><strong>US-made JDAM&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Two weapons experts told AFP that a sliver of munition seen in a video of the blast site circulating online was a tail fin from a US-made Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM). AFP could not independently verify the video.</p>

<p>The GPS-aided kit converts unguided free-fall bombs -- so-called "dumb bombs" -- into precision-guided "smart" munitions that can be directed towards single or multiple targets.</p>

<p>The United States developed the kit to improve accuracy in adverse weather after Operation Desert Storm in 1991.</p>

<p>The first JDAMs were delivered in 1997 and, according to the US Air Force, have a 95 percent system reliability.</p>

<p>Trevor Ball, a former US Army explosive ordnance disposal technician, concluded from images of the Al-Mawasi strike "it's 100 percent a JDAM kit" made in the United States.</p>

<p>He said that given the types of bombs compatible with the guidance system and the size of the fin fragment, the JDAM was most likely used with either a 1,000 or 2,000 pound (450 or 900 kilogramme) payload.</p>

<p>He said the fragment could also be compatible with the BLU-109 "bunker buster" warhead, which is designed to penetrate concrete.</p>

<p>Ball said it was not possible to definitively determine where the payload itself was made without "very specific fragments of the bomb body".</p>

<h3><strong>New delivery&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Repeated use of such large bombs in the densely populated Gaza Strip has sparked humanitarian outcry and heaped pressure on US President Joe Biden to reconsider the munitions supplied to Israel.</p>

<p>On July 12, Israel's main military backer announced it was ending a pause on supplying 500-pound bombs, though Biden said the 2,000-pound type would be withheld.</p>

<p>The White House has repeatedly voiced frustration over the civilian casualties in Gaza as Israel attempts to eradicate Hamas.</p>

<p>US Secretary of State Antony Blinken told two top Israeli officials on Monday that the civilian casualties was "unacceptably high", his spokesman said.</p>

<p>Israeli officials said their "precise strike" in Al-Mawasi hit an open area that housed a Hamas compound and not a civilian camp.</p>

<p>When contacted by AFP regarding the weapons used, the Israeli military declined to comment.</p>

<p>Based on Israel's stated target, Wes Bryant, a retired US Air Force master sergeant and strike and joint targeting expert, said it would have been feasible to avoid collateral damage in the surrounding area.</p>

<p>"My assessment is that any civilians killed in this strike were in the compound -- not in the surrounding vicinity. So the IDF either failed to assess presence of civilians, or... deemed the risk to civilians proportional to the military advantage of taking out the Hamas leaders."</p>

<h3><strong>'Absolute destruction'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>The strike left Al-Mawasi a scene of "absolute destruction" with no water, electricity or sewage treatment, the Islamic Relief charity said.</p>

<p>It condemned Israel for its willingness "to kill innocent men, women and children in pursuit of its end goals".</p>

<p>Hamas said that by arming Israel, the Biden administration is "legally and morally responsible" for spawning a "major humanitarian catastrophe".</p>

<p>It said US-supplied weapons used by Israel included GPS-guided bombs, dumb bombs, bunker busters and JDAMs.</p>

<p>After repeated high-casualty strikes in recent days, a Hamas official said the group was withdrawing from indirect talks for a truce and hostage release deal with Israel.</p>

<p>The war was sparked by Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel, which resulted in the deaths of 1,195 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.</p>

<p>Israel responded with a military offensive that has killed at least 38,664 people in Gaza, also mostly civilians, according to the Hamas-ruled territory's health ministry.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Facing growing criticism over a massive security failure, the US Secret Service on Monday vowed to cooperate with an independent review after a shooter was allowed to open fire on Donald Trump.</p>

<p>The 78-year-old former president was injured but survived an assassination attempt at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania on Saturday, a brazen attack that shocked a nation already deeply polarized ahead of the November election.</p>

<p>"The Secret Service is working with all involved federal, state and local agencies to understand what happened, how it happened, and how we can prevent an incident like this from ever taking place again," the agency's director Kimberly Cheatle said in a statement.</p>

<p>"We understand the importance of the independent review announced by President (Joe) Biden yesterday and will participate fully," Cheatle added.</p>

<p>Trump was speaking at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, when multiple bangs rang out.</p>

<p>He clutched his ear, with blood visible on his ear and cheek, then ducked to the floor as Secret Service agents swarmed onto the podium, surrounding him and rushing him to a nearby vehicle.</p>

<p>The shooter and a bystander were killed, and two spectators were injured.</p>

<p>Newly surfaced video backs up reports from witnesses that they had called out to police and physically pointed at the shooter as he lay on the roof preparing to open fire, the Washington Post reported Monday.</p>

<p>The shots targeting Trump rang out 86 seconds after the first audible attempts to warn the police, the Post said, citing an analysis it did of video clips from the scene of the attack.</p>

<p>Biden ordered a full review of the security at the rally, as well as at this week's Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where Trump will be crowned the party's presidential nominee.</p>

<p>In an interview with NBC on Monday, the president said he feels "safe with the Secret Service," though he added it was an "open question" whether they should have better anticipated the shooting at the Trump rally.</p>

<p>Biden has also ordered Secret Service protection for independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an environmental lawyer and long-time vaccine skeptic who has no chance of winning in November, but whose candidacy could potentially sway close contests in key swing states.</p>

<h3><strong>Heightened risk&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>The Secret Service faces intense scrutiny over how a gunman aiming an assault rifle was able to take position on a roof some 500 feet (150 meters) from one of the most protected political figures on the planet.</p>

<p>With Trump set to star at the convention, Cheatle said the agency was working to toughen security.</p>

<p>The Secret Service designs plans for major events "to respond to a kinetic security environment and the most up-to-date intelligence," her statement said.</p>

<p>Earlier in the day, Trump had called for Secret Service protection for Kennedy "in light of what is going on in the world today."</p>

<p>"Given the history of the Kennedy Family, this is the obvious right thing to do!" Trump wrote on his Truth Social website.</p>

<p>Kennedy's uncle, President John F. Kennedy, was assassinated in Dallas, Texas in 1963. Five years later, the candidate's father, Robert, was shot to death in Los Angeles while on the campaign trail.</p>

<p>The US Secret Service is responsible for the safety of the president, vice president and former presidents, and their families, as well as major election candidates and visiting foreign heads of state.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After dodging a bullet at a rally and seeing the US Supreme Court bolster his presidential immunity claims this month, Donald Trump was handed another gift Monday: the dismissal of his classified documents case.</p>

<p>As the only president ever to be twice impeached -- and twice acquitted -- and the country's only ex-president convicted of criminal charges, the septuagenarian has often struggled to stay afloat.</p>

<p>His blunders, multitude of scandals and vitriolic statements have shocked millions of Americans. Many heads of state see him as a danger to global stability and the fight against global warming, and he has stood accused of indulging far-right groups and disparaging immigrants.</p>

<p>But each time he is said to be sunk, he roars back to the surface, and this week he is heading into Milwaukee riding very high.</p>

<p>On Thursday, the Republican National Convention will overlook Trump's vows of vengeance against his political enemies and swat aside his various legal woes to formally nominate him as the party's flagbearer going into the November election against President Joe Biden.</p>

<p>Trump, the brash billionaire who burst onto the political landscape a decade ago as a super disruptor and champion of conservatives, appears unstoppable.</p>

<p>"It sure seems he's on a roll," Texas alternate delegate Orlando Dona, wearing Trump pins and a straw-colored cowboy hat, told AFP.</p>

<p>The 64-year-old Dona, like many conservatives, believes the various cases against Trump have been politically motivated, "and he is coming out of all this justified."</p>

<p>As for the shooting, some are chalking it up to divine intervention.</p>

<p>"I personally think it was the hand of God," Wisconsin former governor Scott Walker told AFP at the convention.</p>

<p>Walker, who ran for president against Trump briefly in 2016, said Trump the man has earned a reputation for taking on anything.</p>

<p>"He's never going to stop being a fighter," he said. "And I think people here realize he's fighting for them, and these wins are not just about wins for him, they're wins for the American people."</p>

<p>'A lot of obstacles'</p>

<p>Trump earned the nickname "Teflon Don" for weathering a multitude of storms.</p>

<p>The #MeToo movement precipitated the downfall of dozens of powerful Americans. Not Trump, despite multiple accusations of sexual abuse, a 2023 civil trial finding of liability for the sexual assault of writer E. Jean Carroll, and an alleged affair with pornographic actress Stormy Daniels.</p>

<p>After an explosive "Access Hollywood" tape emerged in 2016 in which Trump makes degrading remarks about women and boasted about groping their genitals, some Republican heavyweights withdrew their support, and he was predicted to lose the female vote.</p>

<p>That collapse didn't happen, and he won the White House a month later.</p>

<p>Now, it appears he will pull off another miracle, avoiding three of the four lawsuits he had been facing before the election.</p>

<p>"If the story of even the last 18 months teaches us anything, there were a lot of obstacles that were put up to president Trump, and the fact that he's gotten through them shows, I think, part of what gives me faith in this country," businessman and former 2024 Vivek Ramaswamy told reporters at the convention.</p>

<p>"As Martin Luther King said, the arc of history is long but it bends towards justice," Mr Ramaswamy said. "I believe that's exactly what it is doing in recent months, days, and over the last year of president Trump's journey as well."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Billionaire Elon Musk has endorsed Republican former President Donald Trump in the race for the White House, but employees at his collection of companies are largely donating to Trump's Democratic rival Kamala Harris.</p>

<p>Workers at Tesla have contributed $42,824 to Harris' presidential campaign versus $24,840 to Trump's campaign, according to OpenSecrets, a nonpartisan nonprofit that tracks U.S. campaign contributions and lobbying data.</p>

<p>Employees at Musk's rocket company SpaceX have donated $34,526 to Harris versus $7,652 to Trump. Employees at the social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, have donated $13,213 to Harris versus less than $500 to Trump.</p>

<p>While the figures are relatively small for campaign fundraising, they indicate political leanings at odds with Musk's own. The world's richest man, Musk has boosted Trump on X and dismissed left-leaning ideas as a "woke-mind virus."</p>

<p>Musk did not immediately respond to a request for comment. He backed President Joe Biden in 2020 but has tacked rightward since then. Trump has said that if he wins the Nov. 5 election, he will appoint Musk to lead a government efficiency commission.</p>

<p>The OpenSecrets data includes donations from company employees and owners and those individuals' immediate family members. Campaign finance laws prohibit companies themselves from donating to federal campaigns.</p>

<p>Many of Musk's employees are based in California, a Democratic stronghold, said Ross Gerber, CEO of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth and Investment Management, which is a Tesla shareholder. Gerber is also an investor in X.</p>

<p>In July, Musk said he would move X and SpaceX headquarters to Texas from California because of a California gender-identity law he called the "last straw." Gerber said such a move would mean "losing out on a lot of potential talent" in California.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A new poll released Wednesday shows Kamala Harris with significant leads over Donald Trump in swing-states Pennsylvania and Michigan, two "blue wall" battlegrounds seen as key to winning the White House in&nbsp; November.</p>

<p>The surveys, conducted after the September 10 televised debate between the two candidates, suggest a post-showdown boost for Vice President Harris, who is widely perceived as having outperformed her Republican opponent on stage.</p>

<p>In the latest poll of likely voters by Quinnipiac University, Harris is leading ex-president Trump 51 percent to 45 percent in Pennsylvania, and tops him 50-45 percent in Michigan, two states in the post-industrial Rust Belt in the American Midwest and Northeast.</p>

<p>A third Rust Belt state that makes up a trio seen as vital for a Harris victory, Wisconsin, has the race essentially tied, with Harris one percentage point ahead, according to Quinnipiac.</p>

<p>Overall polling shows the tightest of races in the seven battleground states that will likely determine the winner in the US Electoral College system.</p>

<p>Trump leads narrowly in the so-called Sun Belt states of Arizona, Georgia, and North Carolina, according to an amalgam of polls on survey tracker RealClearPolitics.com. It shows Harris barely ahead in the fourth Sun Belt state of Nevada.</p>

<p>The Pennsylvania poll of 1,331 likely voters is notable as Harris's six-point margin is outside Quinnipiac's 2.7 percent margin of error -- and twice the same poll's margin of three percentage points in August.</p>

<p>Harris only became the Democratic Party's presidential candidate in July, after President Joe Biden dramatically ended his own reelection bid following a disastrous debate performance against Trump.</p>

<p>Her entrance provided an energetic jolt to the party and she has fared better against Trump than Biden did in the polls. Recent weeks have been seen as critical for Harris as voters have limited time to get to know the vice president and her policies before Election Day on November 5.</p>

<p>"Three crucial swing states wave a red flag at the Trump campaign," Quinnipiac University Polling analyst Tim Malloy said in a statement, noting that the Republican Party's typical "attack strategies against Democrats on immigration and the economy may be losing momentum."</p>

<p>The latest ABC News/Ipsos national poll, post-debate, shows Harris with a four-point overall lead, while a post-debate Atlas Intel poll has Trump ahead by three percentage points nationally.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Germany has put a hold on new exports of weapons of war to Israel while it deals with legal challenges, according to a Reuters analysis of data and a source close to the Economy Ministry.</p>

<p>Last year, Germany approved arms exports to Israel worth 326.5 million euros ($363.5 million), including military equipment and war weapons, a 10-fold increase from 2022, according to data from the Economy Ministry, which approves export licences.</p>

<p>However approvals have dropped this year, with only 14.5 million euros' worth granted from January to Aug. 21, according to data provided by the Economy Ministry in response to a parliamentary question.</p>

<p>Of this, the "weapons of war" category accounted for only 32,449 euros.</p>

<p>A source close to the ministry cited a senior government official as saying it had stopped work on approving export licences for arms to Israel pending a resolution of legal cases arguing that such exports from Germany breached humanitarian law.</p>

<p>The ministry did not respond to requests for comment.</p>

<p>In its defence of two cases, one before the International Court of Justice and one in Berlin brought by the European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights (ECCHR), the government has said no weapons of war have been exported under any licence issued since the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks on Israel, apart from spares for long-term contracts, the source added.</p>

<p>Israel's assault on Gaza has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians since Oct. 7, according to the local Hamas-controlled health ministry. It has also displaced most of the population of 2.3 million, caused a hunger crisis and led to genocide allegations at the World Court, which Israel denies.</p>

<p>No case challenging German arms exports to Israel has yet succeeded, including a case brought by Nicaragua at the ICJ.</p>

<p><strong>DISAGREEMENT ON ARMS EXPORTS IN GERMAN GOVERNMENT</strong></p>

<p>But the issue has created friction within the government as the Chancellery maintains its support for Israel while the Greens-led Economy and Foreign ministries, sensitive to criticism from party members, have increasingly criticised the Netanyahu administration.</p>

<p>Legal challenges across Europe have also led other allies of Israel to pause or suspend arms exports.</p>

<p>Britain this month suspended 30 out of 350 licences for arms exports to Israel due to concerns that Israel could be violating international humanitarian law.</p>

<p>In February, a Dutch court ordered the Netherlands to halt all exports of F-35 fighter jet parts to Israel over concerns about their use in attacks on civilian targets in Gaza.</p>

<p>President Joe Biden's administration this year paused - but then resumed - shipments of some bombs to Israel after U.S. concerns about their use in densely populated Gaza.</p>

<p>Approvals and shipments of other types of weapons, in more precise systems, continued as U.S. officials maintained that Israel needed the capacity to defend itself.</p>

<p>Alexander Schwarz, a lawyer at ECCHR, which has filed five lawsuits against Berlin, suggested that the significant decline in approvals for 2024 indicated a genuine, though possibly temporary, reluctance to supply weapons to Israel.</p>

<p>"However, I would not interpret this as a conscious change in policy," Schwarz added.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The US Federal Reserve cut its key lending rate by half a percentage-point Wednesday in its first reduction since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, sharply lowering borrowing costs shortly before November's presidential election.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US Federal Reserve cut its key lending rate by half a percentage-point Wednesday in its first reduction since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, sharply lowering borrowing costs shortly before November's presidential election.</p>

<p>The Fed's decision will affect the rates at which commercial banks lend to consumers and businesses, bringing down the cost of borrowing on everything from mortgages to credit cards.</p>

<p>The news will likely be well-received by Democratic candidate Kamala Harris, who has looked to highlight President Joe Biden's economic record in her race against Donald Trump.</p>

<p>Policymakers voted 11-to-1 in favor of lowering the US central bank's benchmark rate to between 4.75 percent and 5.00 percent, the Fed announced in a statement.</p>

<p>The key holdout was Fed governor Michelle Bowman, who supported a more conventional quarter-point cut.</p>

<p><strong>Fed 'gained greater confidence'</strong></p>

<p>The Fed said its rate-setting committee "has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent, and judges that the risks to achieving its employment and inflation goals are roughly in balance."</p>

<p>The bank has a dual mandate from Congress to act independently to tackle both inflation and employment.</p>

<p>Analysts were expecting the Fed to cut rates on Wednesday, as inflation eases toward the bank's long-term target of two percent, and the labor market continues to cool in the surprisingly resilient post-Covid economy.</p>

<p>But they were highly uncertain about the size of the move, with some anticipating a small cut of a quarter of a percentage point, and others predicting the more significant half-point cut, which carries a greater risk of reigniting inflation.</p>

<p>In updated economic forecasts published alongside the Fed's rate decision, policymakers' median forecasts pointed to an unemployment rate of 4.4 percent, on average, in the fourth quarter of this year, up from 4.0 percent in the last update in June.</p>

<p>They also penciled in an annual headline inflation rate of 2.3 percent, slightly lower than in June.</p>

<p>The decision to cut more sharply to begin with caught some analysts by surprise.</p>

<p>"In our base case the Fed cuts 25bp (basis points) but signals 100bp of cuts this year with the median 2024 'dot'", economists at Citi wrote in an investor note published ahead of the rate decision.</p>

<p><strong>Election stakes</strong></p>

<p>The Fed's mandate gives it the independence to set monetary policy solely on the basis of economic data.</p>

<p>But its decision will likely have political ramifications, given the importance of inflation and the cost of living to US consumers.</p>

<p>Americans have consistently said both are a top concern ahead of the election.</p>

<p>Trump has repeatedly criticized Fed Chair Powell, who he first appointed to run the Fed, and has suggested that its decisions are political -- accusations the US central bank has strongly refuted.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>India on Wednesday abstained in the UN General Assembly on a resolution that demanded that Israel bring an end, "without delay", to its unlawful presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory within 12 months.</p>

<p>The 193-member General Assembly adopted the resolution, with 124 nations voting in favour, 14 against and 43 abstentions, including that by India.</p>

<p>Those abstaining included Australia, Canada, Germany, Italy, Nepal, Ukraine and the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>Israel and the US were among the nations who voted against the resolution titled 'Advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice on the legal consequences arising from Israel's policies and practices in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and from the illegality of Israel's continued presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory'.</p>

<p>The resolution adopted Wednesday demanded that "Israel brings to an end without delay its unlawful presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, which constitutes a wrongful act of a continuing character entailing its international responsibility, and do so no later than 12 months from the adoption of the present resolution." The Palestinian-drafted resolution also strongly deplored the continued and total disregard and breaches by the Government of Israel of its obligations under the Charter of the United Nations, international law and the relevant United Nations resolutions, and stressed that such breaches seriously threaten regional and international peace and security.</p>

<p>It recognised that Israel must be held to account for any violations of international law in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including any violations of international humanitarian law and international human rights law, and that it "must bear the legal consequences of all its internationally wrongful acts, including by making reparation for the injury, including any damage, caused by such acts."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In Israel's first reaction since thousands of pager and walkie-talkie blasts rocked Lebanon over two days, the defence minister in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government has announced that the "centre of gravity" of the Middle East conflict is "moving north".</p>

<p>Benjamin Netanyahu also gave a brief video statement in which he promised that tens of thousands of residents from Israel's northern border with Lebanon will "return to their homes".</p>

<p>Lebanon's militant outfit Hezbollah has been backing Hamas in the Gaza war shortly after it began in October 2023 and regular exchange of fire between Hezbollah militia and Israel's armed forces have been going on for the last many months, however tensions have surges since Tuesday's pager explosions across Lebanon which killed twelve and injured nearly 3,000 people, mostly linked with Hezbollah.</p>

<p>Hezbollah has blamed Israel for what it calls their "biggest-ever" security breach. Mr Netanyahu, however, didn't speak directly about the explosions that have rocked Lebanon.</p>

<p>Less than twenty-four hours since thousands of pagers blew up across Lebanon, hand-held walkie-talkies have today exploded killing another nine people and wounding over 300.</p>

<p>During his statement Mr Netanyahu said, "I have said it before, we will return to the citizens of the north to their homes in security and that's exactly what we are going to do."</p>

<p>To this, Israel's Defence Minister Yoav Gallant added that "forces are being sent to the northern border." Israel has said that the war has now "moved into a new phase", amid concerns that a new front to the war may soon see escalation.</p>

<p>"The 'centre of gravity' is moving north, meaning that we are allocating forces, resources and energy for the northern arena," the defence minister said in remarks released by his office.</p>

<p>While the Gaza strip is on Israel's south-western front, Lebanon shares a border with Israel's north.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[A Florida woman, Laurie Leigh Shaver, has been convicted of second-degree murder for killing her husband in 2015 and burying his body under a fire pit in their backyard.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A woman from Florida, United States, Laurie Leigh Shaver, was convicted on Friday for the 2015 murder of her husband, Michael Douglas Shaver, who was 36 years old. The jury pronounced Shaver guilty of second-degree murder with a firearm after four hours of deliberation, but she was acquitted for accessory charges.</p>

<p>Trial began on September 9, and there was an indication that Michael's body was buried underneath the concrete fire pit at their house in Clermont, Lake County. He had been missing since November 2015, and his friend had alerted the authorities in February 2018 citing his disappearance. Michael was a monorail technician at Disney World.</p>

<p>When Lake County deputies first responded to the Shaver home, Laurie was claiming Michael had abandoned his family, but Laurie became evasive when police asked her to grant them permission to search the property with dogs. A later search, equipped with cadaver dogs and ground-penetrating radar, led to the discovery of Michael's body, wrapped in a tarp and buried under the fire pit.</p>

<p>Police confirmed that Laurie Shaver was posing as her husband on social media so that she wouldn't be noticed as the murderer.</p>

<p>"We understand the profound impact this case has had on Michael Shaver's family and friends. We hope this verdict brings some measure of closure for them. Crimes like this leave a deep and lasting impact on our society," said fifth-judicial-circuit state attorney Bill Gladson.</p>

<p>"I would like to commend Sheriff Peyton Grinnell and Lieutenant Tamara Dale of the Lake County Sheriff's Office in Florida, along with Assistant State Attorneys Nick Camuccio and Rich Buxman for their diligent work throughout the investigation of this case. Their efforts have been instrumental in obtaining justice for Michael," said the state attorney Bill Gladson.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A preliminary investigation has found hundreds of pagers that exploded across Lebanon, killing at least 12 people and wounding up to 2,800, had been booby-trapped, a security official said on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Lebanon opened a probe into the explosions on Tuesday, a judicial official said, adding security services were working to determine the cause of the blasts which have been blamed on Israel.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, a new wave of exploding hand-held devices, this time walkie-talkies, killed nine people and wounded more than 300 wounded across Lebanon, the health ministry said.</p>

<p>"Data indicates the devices were pre-programmed to detonate and contained explosive materials planted next to the battery," the official said about Tuesday's blasts, requesting anonymity to discuss sensitive matters.</p>

<p>Some of the devices that exploded were being inspected, the security official said, but "most of them were destroyed and burned".</p>

<p>The official said it was unlikely the lithium batteries inside the devices had heated up and exploded.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Florida woman who spent her life savings of $350,000 (Rs 29,28,5410) on a dream trip around the world - selling everything she owns for a chance to circle the globe aboard the maiden voyage of the three-year Villa Vie Odyssey - has been banned from the cruise after her private WhatsApp comments were leaked, according to <em>The New York Post</em>. Jenny Phenix, a 68-year-old divorced mother of two, liquidated her possessions and businesses, living out of a suitcase as she prepared for the odyssey.</p>

<p>As changes were made to the cruise itineraries, Phenix wrote on her WhatsApp group to her fellow travelers: "I am just so disappointed we won't be docking in Miami where I will be picking up remaining belongings for our journey. I also worry that maybe we'll still have some refurbishment going on when we leave Belfast so that my cabin can be occupied by crew members, so I'll have a temporary cabin. Cruise ship operator Villa Vie Residences received her messages, leading to the cancellation of her contract due to "behavior impacting community morale."</p>

<p>"I cannot even begin to explain the emotional devastation and the physical toll this has taken on me," she told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/09/18/us-news/florida-mom-jenny-phenix-booted-from-her-dream-3-year-villa-vie-odyssey-cruise-over-whatsapp-messages-after-selling-her-possessions/"><em>The New York Post.</em></a> "It is still very hard for me to discuss, as I had the same dream everyone else on that ship does, and they took that from me seemingly without a thought."</p>

<p>"I will have to stay with my daughter until I figure out a whole new plan for my life."</p>

<p>The program starts at $300000 and requires guests to pay at least half the deposit, according to the company's website.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As mobile phones became the world's main communications tool, pagers, also known as beepers because of the sound they make to notify users about incoming messages, were largely rendered obsolete, with demand plunging from their 1990s heyday.</p>

<p>But the tiny electronic devices remain a vital means of communication in some areas - such as healthcare and emergency services - thanks to their durability and long battery life.</p>

<p>"It's the cheapest and most efficient way to communicate to a large number of people about messages that don't need responses," said a senior surgeon at a major UK hospital, adding that pagers are commonly used by doctors and nurses across the country's National Health Service (NHS).</p>

<p>"It's used to tell people where to go, when, and what for."</p>

<p>Pagers grabbed headlines on Tuesday when thousands used by members of Lebanese group Hezbollah were detonated simultaneously across Lebanon, killing at least nine people and wounding nearly 3,000 others.</p>

<p>According to a senior Lebanese security source and another source, explosives inside the devices were planted by Israel's Mossad spy agency.</p>

<p>The UK's NHS was using around 130,000 pagers in 2019, more than one in 10 of the world's pagers, according to the government. More up-to-date figures were not available.</p>

<p>Doctors working in hospital emergency departments carry them when they are on call.</p>

<p>Many pagers can also send out a siren and then broadcast a voice message to groups so that whole medical teams are alerted simultaneously to an emergency, a senior doctor in the NHS said. That is not possible with a mobile phone.</p>

<p>Britain's Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) uses pagers to alert its crews, a source familiar with the lifeboat service told Reuters. The RNLI declined to comment.</p>

<p><strong>BURNER PHONES</strong></p>

<p>Pagers can be harder to track than smartphones because they lack more modern navigation technologies like the Global Positioning System, or GPS.</p>

<p>That has made them a popular choice among criminals, especially drug dealers in the United States, in the past.</p>

<p>But gangs are using mobile phones more these days, former FBI agent Ken Gray told Reuters.</p>

<p>"I don't know if anyone uses them (pagers)," he said.</p>

<p>"They all went to cell phones, burner phones" which can be easily disposed of and replaced with another phone with a different number, making them difficult to trace.</p>

<p>Gray, who served 24 years at the Federal Bureau of Investigation and now teaches criminal justice and homeland security at the University of New Haven, said that criminals changed with the times and newer technology.</p>

<p>The global pagers market, once a major source of revenue for companies like Motorola, amounted to $1.6 billion in 2023, according to an April report by Cognitive Market Research.</p>

<p>That amounts to a tiny fraction of the global smartphone market, which was estimated at around half a trillion U.S. dollars as of end-2023.</p>

<p>But demand for pagers is rising as a larger patient population creates more need for efficient communication in the healthcare sector, the report said, forecasting compound annual growth of 5.9% from 2023 to 2030.</p>

<p>It said North America and Europe are the two biggest pager markets, generating $528 million and $496 million in revenue respectively.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Wednesday warned against the risk of escalation in the Middle East after the detonation of thousands of Hezbollah pagers threatened to derail his latest regional diplomacy push.</p>

<p>News of the blasts broke as the top US diplomat traveled to Cairo to meet senior Egyptian officials hoping to advance efforts to secure a ceasefire in Gaza and improve ties with Egypt.</p>

<p>Militant group Hezbollah promised to retaliate against Israel, accusing it of detonating pagers across Lebanon on Tuesday killing at least 12 people, including two children, and wounding nearly 3,000.</p>

<p>Israel has declined to respond to questions about the explosions.</p>

<p>Asked about the blasts, Blinken said the United States was still gathering facts but it was in no one's interest for conflict to spread.</p>

<p>"It's imperative that all parties refrain from any actions that could escalate the conflict," Blinken said at a news conference alongside his Egyptian counterpart.</p>

<p>He did not say who the US believes was behind the blasts.</p>

<p>Blinken said he was focused on securing a ceasefire deal that would bring calm, including to Israel's northern border with Lebanon, and that 15 out of 18 paragraphs of a deal had been agreed by all sides.</p>

<p>Making progress involved long waits for messages to be passed between the parties that left time for incidents to disrupt the talks, Blinken said.</p>

<p>"We've seen that in the intervening time, you might have an event, an incident - something that makes the process more difficult, that threatens to slow it, stop it, derail it - and anything of that nature, by definition, is probably not good in terms of achieving the result that we want, which is the ceasefire," Blinken said.</p>

<p>He cited Hamas' execution of six Israeli hostages last month. He did not name Israel, which is believed to have targeted members of groups aligned against it in Lebanon, Syria and Iran that have set back the talks.</p>

<p>President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi told Blinken in their meeting on Wednesday morning that Egypt opposed attempts to "escalate the conflict and expand its scope regionally" and called for all parties to act responsibly, the Egyptian presidency said in a statement.</p>

<p>Blinken will head from Cairo to Paris on Thursday for a meeting with the foreign ministers of France, Italy and Britain to discuss the Middle East and Ukraine and other issues, a State Department official said. Blinken will also meet French President Emmanuel Macron, the official said.</p>

<p>Blinken will not visit Israel on this trip, the first time he has skipped a stop in Washington's closest regional ally since Hamas sparked the war in Gaza nearly a year ago.</p>

<p>State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said on Tuesday that was because Washington aimed to discuss bilateral issues with Egypt on this trip and the Gaza ceasefire proposal that U.S. and mediators have been working on was still not ready to present to Israel.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[Jordan Brielle, a 32-year-old Ohio woman, suffered serious health issues after becoming addicted to vaping. Despite her deteriorating health, Brielle continued to vape, eventually leading to a medically induced coma.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An American woman in Ohio is on the mend after being put in a medically induced coma due to serious health problems stemming from her vaping habit. Jordan Brielle, 32, had two litres of "black and bloody" fluid removed from her lungs by doctors, according to <em>The New York Post. </em>Brielle started smoking when she was still a teenager but kicked over to vaping in 2021.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/09/16/lifestyle/vaping-addict-finally-quit-when-lungs-collapsed-black-goo-came-out/">According to her</a>, she became addicted very fast, and it became a strain on her pocket as she found herself spending up to $500 every week on vape products. "I was totally addicted," she said. "I was vaping so much that I slept with it and even took it into the shower."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't wish what I'd been through on anyone else. I feel grateful to be alive," Ms Brielle said.</p>

<p>This heavy vaping continued for two years until Brielle began to feel "heaviness" in her lungs last November, which was then diagnosed at first as a respiratory infection. Given her deteriorating health condition and troubled breathing, as well as persistent coughing, Brielle continued vaping.</p>

<p>She went to the hospital several times complaining of breathing problems.</p>

<p>"I had a horrible cough and was going to the hospital two or three times a week for help. I had little to no voice," <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/09/16/lifestyle/vaping-addict-finally-quit-when-lungs-collapsed-black-goo-came-out/">Brielle recalled.</a> "Each time they would send me home. It felt like there were 80 pounds of pressure just lying on my chest. I'd never felt so sick in my life."</p>

<p>The situation worsened when her boyfriend discovered her unconscious with "black mucus coming out of my mouth and my nose." He said he could see she was breathing, but she wasn't reacting, with a very weak pulse.</p>

<p>Her boyfriend immediately dialled 911 and stayed beside her until the paramedics could reach her. They were able to rush her to the hospital, and doctors could extract the toxic substance from her lungs. Brielle's life story opens your eyes to the dangers of vaping; it is also a realisation of what health implications you will get from vaping.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A series of walkie-talkie explosions caught Lebanon unawares today, killing at least nine people so far. According to Lebanon health ministry, over 300 people have been injured. This comes a day after the explosion of thousands of pagers sent shockwaves across the country, killing 14 people and injuring a whopping 2,800.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Today's blasts happened across southern Lebanon as well as Beirut's suburbs. At least one of the blasts happened near a funeral organised by Hezbollah for a member who was killed in yesterday's pager blasts. A video of the incident was widely circulated on social media platforms.</p>

<p>Iran-backed Hezbollah said today that it attacked Israeli artillery positions with rockets in the first strike at its arch-rival since pager blasts wounded thousands of its members in Lebanon and raised the prospect of a wider Middle East war.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Twin attacks using communication devices, suspected to have an Israeli hand, have struck fear in the ranks of Hezbollah, the Iran-backed militant group based in Lebanon.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<ol>
	<li>At least 14 people have been killed and over 300 wounded when hand-held radios or walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah exploded across the south of Lebanon and the group's strongholds in the country's capital, Beirut, on Wednesday.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>One of the blasts occurred near a funeral organised by Hezbollah for those killed when thousands of pagers exploded across Lebanon on Tuesday. The number of people dead in Tuesday's explosions has risen to 12, including two children.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>The attacks have raised Hezbolah's tensions with Israel - which it has blamed for the pager explosions - that were already high because of Tel Aviv's war with Hamas in Gaza, and the group said it had used rockets to attack Israeli artillery positions</li>
	<li>The coordinated targeting of communication devices used by Hezbollah is being widely seen as an attempt to throw the group in disarray and a way of demonstrating to its members that the attackers can get at them in ways they least expect.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>A senior Lebanese security source and another person in the know told news agency Reuters that Israel's spy agency Mossad, which has a long history of carrying out sophisticated operations on foreign soil, planted explosives inside pagers imported by Hezbollah months before they went off on Tuesday.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>The senior Lebanese security source told Reuters the group had ordered 5,000 pagers made by Taiwan-based Gold Apollo and another source said three grams of explosives had been hidden in each of the ordered devices, which had gone undetected for months. Gold Apollo said the devices were made under licence by a company called BAC, based in Hungary.</li>
	<li>Iran's state media had reported that its Ambassador to Lebanon, Mojtaba Amani, was also wounded in Tuesday's explosions.</li>
	<li>The walkie-talkies which exploded on Wednesday, a source told Reuters, were purchased by Hezbollah five months ago, around the same time that the pagers were bought.</li>
	<li>United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said on Wednesday that civilian objects should not be weaponised. "I think it's very important that there is an effective control of civilian objects, not to weaponise civilian objects... that should be a rule that governments should, be able to implement," he said.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Mr Guterres also warned of a risk of serious escalation. "As important as the event in itself, is the indication that this event confirms that there is a serious risk of a dramatic escalation in Lebanon -- and everything must be done to avoid the escalation," he said.&nbsp;</li>

       <description><![CDATA[The mass pager attack against Hezbollah in Lebanon has turned the spotlight on Israel's secretive Unit 8200, the Israel Defense Forces' intelligence unit, which a Western security source said was involved in planning the operation.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The mass pager attack against Hezbollah in Lebanon has turned the spotlight on Israel's secretive Unit 8200, the Israel Defense Forces' intelligence unit, which a Western security source said was involved in planning the operation.</p>

<p>Israeli officials have remained silent on the audacious intelligence operation that killed 12 people on Tuesday and wounded thousands of Hezbollah operatives. At least one person was killed on Wednesday when hand-held radios used by Hezbollah detonated.</p>

<p>A senior Lebanese security source and another source told Reuters that Israel's Mossad spy agency was responsible for a sophisticated operation to plant a small quantity of explosives inside 5,000 pagers ordered by Hezbollah.</p>

<p>One Western security source told Reuters that Unit 8200, a military unit that is not part of the spy agency, was involved in the development stage of the operation against Hezbollah which was over a year in the making.</p>

<p>The source said Unit 8200 was involved in the technical side of testing how they could insert explosive material within the manufacturing process.</p>

<p>The Israeli military declined to comment. The prime minister's office which has oversight of Mossad did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>

<p>Yossi Kuperwasser, a former military intelligence official and now research director at the Israel Defense and Security Forum, said there was no confirmation that the military intelligence unit was involved in the attack.</p>

<p>But he said 8200's members were some of the best and brightest personnel in the Israeli military, serving in a unit at the centre of Israel's defence capabilities.</p>

<p>"The challenges they are facing are immense, very demanding, and we need the best people to get involved in that," he said.</p>

<p>The unit - and its legion of young, hand-picked soldiers - develops and operates intelligence gathering tools and is often likened to the U.S. National Security Agency.</p>

<p>In a rare public statement about the unit's activities, the IDF said in 2018 that it had helped to thwart an air attack by Islamic State on a Western country. At the time, it said the unit's operations ran from intelligence gathering and cyber defence to "technological attacks and strikes."</p>

<p>While Israel has never confirmed its involvement, Unit 8200 was reported to have been involved in the Stuxnet attack that disabled Iranian nuclear centrifuges as well as a series of other high-profile operations outside Israel.</p>

<p><strong>YOUNG RECRUITS</strong></p>

<p>The unit is effectively Israel's early warning system, and like much of the rest of the defence and security establishment, shouldered some of the blame for failing to detect Hamas' Oct. 7 assault on southern Israel.</p>

<p>Its commander last week said he was stepping down. In his resignation letter carried by Israeli media, he said he hadn't fulfilled his mission.</p>

<p>The unit is famous for a work culture that emphasizes out-of-the-box thinking to tackle issues previously not encountered or imagined. This helped some graduates build Israel's high-tech sector and some of its biggest companies.</p>

<p>"Whether it's a problem with software weakness, math, encryption, a problem hacking into something ... you must be capable of doing it on your own," said Avi Shua, a graduate of 8200, who went on to co-found Orca Security, a cloud security unicorn.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The unit has a high turnover rate of young recruits replacing veterans, said Kobi Samboursky, another former 8200 member and Managing Partner at Glilot Capital Partners, an early-stage fund investing in cybersecurity and artificial intelligence.</p>

<p>"The most significant thing here is the 'can-do' culture, where everything is possible," Samboursky said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on Wednesday said the kingdom would not recognise Israel without a Palestinian state and strongly condemned the "crimes of the Israeli occupation" against the Palestinian people.</p>

<p>"The kingdom will not stop its tireless work towards the establishment of an independent Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital, and we affirm that the kingdom will not establish diplomatic relations with Israel without that," the crown prince, known as MbS, said.</p>

<p>After the eruption of war last October between Israel and Palestinian group Hamas that rules Gaza, Saudi Arabia put on ice US-backed plans for the kingdom to normalise ties with Israel, two sources familiar with Riyadh's thinking said earlier this year, in a swift reordering of its diplomatic priorities.</p>

<p>MbS, Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler, had said just weeks before the fighting broke out that Riyadh was getting closer to a deal.</p>

<p>The two sources told Reuters there would be some delay in the US-backed talks on normalisation of Saudi-Israel ties, which is seen as a key step for the kingdom to secure what it considers the real prize of a US defence pact in exchange.</p>

<p>MbS made the remarks at an annual speech to the advisory Shura Council, which he gave on behalf of his father, King Salman.</p>

<p>The council swore an oath of office before MbS on Wednesday before he addressed it.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Dutch scientists from ASTRON are raising concerns about the second-generation Starlink satellites, claiming they cause significant interference with radio telescopes.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Elon Musk's new generation of Starlink satellites is raising concerns among Dutch scientists who claim the new satellites will bring fast internet worldwide and are proving to be interference for astronomers on a massive scale.</p>

<p>Thousands of orbiting Starlink satellites "are blinding" radio telescopes, perhaps causing damage to astronomical research, according to researchers at the Netherlands Institute for Radio Astronomy (<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.astron.nl/starlink-satellites/">ASTRON</a>). As these telescopes work on radio waves to examine the universe, it makes the collection of clean data much more complicated because of the interference caused by these satellites.</p>

<p>Starlink satellites connect remote areas with broadband internet, be it challenging conditions like in Ukraine and Yemen or the rural districts of the UK, for that matter. The Department for Digital, Culture, Media, and Sport reported how tests conducted in 2022 showed that Starlink could deliver internet speeds four times faster than the average.</p>

<p>Scientists argue, however, that such privilege comes at an appreciable cost in terms of research.</p>

<p>"With LOFAR (Low Frequency Array), we have started a program to monitor unintended emission from satellites belonging to different constellations, and our observations show that the second-generation Starlink satellites emit stronger emission and do so over a larger range of radio frequencies, compared to the first-generation satellites," <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.astron.nl/starlink-satellites/">says Cees Bassa</a> from ASTRON (the Netherlands Institute for Radio Astronomy), the lead author of the study.</p>

<p>According to a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.astron.nl/starlink-satellites/"><em>release by ASTRON,</em></a> the analysis revealed that these newer satellites emit up to 32 times brighter unintended radio waves compared to the first generation, with levels potentially exceeding internationally regulated thresholds for interference set for intentional emissions and even more relaxed terrestrial electromagnetic compatibility standards.</p>

<p>"Compared to the faintest astrophysical sources that we observe with LOFAR, UEMR from Starlink satellites is 10 million times brighter. This difference is similar to the faintest stars visible to the naked eye and the brightness of the full moon. Since SpaceX is launching about 40 second-generation Starlink satellites every week, this problem is becoming increasingly worse," adds Cees Bassa."</p>

<p>"Humanity is clearly approaching an inflexion point where we need to take action to preserve our sky as a window to explore the universe from Earth. Satellite companies are not interested in producing this unintended radiation, so minimising it should also be a priority in their sustainable space policies," says Federico Di Vruno from the SKA Observatory. "Starlink is not the only big player in LEO, but they have a chance to set the standard here," he continues.</p>

<p>The researchers emphasise that while the second-generation satellites have been designed to enhance connectivity and provide communication services, the unintended radio emissions are a growing threat to the integrity of astronomical observations. As the consequences of such interference become increasingly evident, collaboration between satellite companies, regulatory agencies, and the astronomical community is essential to devise effective mitigation strategies.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Walkie talkies used by Lebanon's Hezbollah members exploded in the group's Beirut stronghold, with a video circulating on social media showing the chaos that unfolded during the explosion, Reuters reported quoting a source close to the group.</p>

<p>One of the explosions occurred during a funeral procession of a Hezbollah member who was killed yesterday in the pager blast. People can be seen scrambling for safety after a device detonated.</p>

<p>How many devices blew up is not known yet. There have been reports of landline telephones exploding too at various locations in East Lebanon.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/walkie-talkies-explode-in-hezbollahs-beirut-stronghold-day-after-pager-blasts-6595278" target="_blank">Nine people have died</a> and more than 100 have been wounded in the second wave of device blasts today, according to officials.</p>

<p>This comes a day after pagers exploded across the country, killing nine people and injuring more than 2,800 others, Lebanese Health Minister Firass Abiad confirmed.</p>

<p>Iran's state media also reported that its Ambassador to Lebanon, Mojtaba Amani, was also wounded in yesterday's pager incident.</p>

<p>The handheld wireless walkie talkies were bought at the same time as the pagers, as per reports.</p>

<p>Iran-backed Hezbollah has blamed Israel for the attack.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The group said today that it attacked Israeli artillery positions with rockets in the first strike at its arch-rival since pager blasts wounded thousands of its members.</p>

<p>Israel's spy agency Mossad planted explosives inside pagers imported by Hezbollah months before Tuesday's detonations, a senior Lebanese security source and another source told news agency Reuters.</p>

<p>Mossad has a long history of sophisticated operations on foreign soil.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fourteen people have died and more than 300 others wounded as walkie-talkies have blown up at Hezbollah strongholds across Lebanon. This comes a day after pagers exploded across the middle-eastern country, killing twelve people and injuring nearly 3,000 others.</p>

<p>How many walkie-talkies blew up are not known, but the count is estimated at several hundred. There are reports that landline telephones exploded too at various locations in East Lebanon.</p>

<p>According to reports, the hand-held wireless radio devices or walkie-talkies were bought around five months ago, approximately the same time as the pagers.</p>

<p>Today's blasts happened across southern Lebanon as well as Beirut's suburbs. At least one of the blasts happened near a funeral organised by Hezbollah for a member who was killed in yesterday's pager blasts. A <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/video-shows-explosion-at-funeral-of-hezbollah-member-killed-in-pager-blast-6595590" target="_blank">video of the incident</a> was widely circulated on social media platforms.</p>

<h2><strong>ISRAEL MOVING TROOPS, US WARNS AGAINST ESCALATION</strong></h2>

<p>Iran-backed Hezbollah said today that it attacked Israeli artillery positions with rockets in the first strike at its arch-rival since pager blasts wounded thousands of its members in Lebanon and raised the prospect of a wider Middle East war.</p>

<p>Israel has on Wednesday warned that Hezbollah's escalation in the last 24 hours has moved the conflict's <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/israel-warns-war-centre-of-gravity-moving-north-amid-hezbollah-escalation-6596774" target="_blank">"centre of gravity to the north"</a>, adding that they are "allocating forces, resources and energy for the northern arena," The United States has <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-warns-against-further-middle-east-escalation-after-lebanon-blasts-6596480" target="_blank">warned against any escalation</a> by either side.</p>

<p>Israel's spy agency Mossad, which has a long history of sophisticated operations on foreign soil, planted explosives inside pagers imported by Hezbollah months before Tuesday's detonations, a senior Lebanese security source and another source told news agency Reuters.</p>

<p>This morning Lebanese Health Minister Firass Abiad confirmed that twelve people were killed and around 2,800 wounded in the incident.</p>

<p>The minister, in a televised press conference, said the blasts "killed twelve people, including a girl", adding that "About 2,800 people were injured and more than 200 of them critically". The injuries were mostly on the face, hands and stomach, he had said.</p>

<p>Iran's state media had reported that its Ambassador to Lebanon, Mojtaba Amani, was also wounded in yesterday's pager incident.</p>

<p>Hezbollah, which is banned both by the United States and the European Union is the political and military establishment in Lebanon and is backed by Iran. Hezbollah backs Hamas, which has been at war with Israel in Gaza since October 2023.</p>

<p>Hezbollah had on Tuesday blamed Israel for the attack and has claimed that this is the "biggest security breach" it has faced yet.</p>

<p>Just like the pagers, all the walkie-talkie devices also exploded at the same time, Hezbollah has claimed.</p>

<p>Hezbollah had called the blasts an "Israeli breach" of its communications network, and has vowed to avenge the attack. Hezbollah also said it will continue to support Hamas in Gaza and that Israel should wait for a response for the "massacre".</p>

<h3><strong>WHO MADE THESE DEVICES?</strong></h3>

<p>Initial reports suggested that the pagers were made by a Taiwanese company, but the firm has denied this. The Taiwanese pager manufacturer - Gold Apollo - said that the devices were made under a licence by a company called BAC, which is situated in Budapest, the capital city of Hungary.</p>

<p>Though Israel has not commented on the blasts, it had said that it is widening the spectrum of its war with Hamas in Gaza to include its fight against its ally Hezbollah. Israel had made this statement hours before the blasts on Tuesday,</p>

<h3><strong>HEZBOLLAH RESPONSE</strong></h3>

<p>Calling it as a "massacre" and "criminal aggression", Hezbollah said Israel is "fully responsible" for these attacks.</p>

<p>Hezbollah, Iran's most powerful proxy in the Middle East, said in a statement it would continue to support Hamas in Gaza and Israel should await a response to the pager "massacre" which left fighters and others bloodied, hospitalised or dead.</p>

<p>Speaking further on the issue, Hezbollah said cross-border firing with Israeli forces have been "ongoing and separate from the difficult reckoning that the criminal enemy must await for its massacre."</p>

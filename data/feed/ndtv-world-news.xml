       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>King Charles shared a joyful moment with the New Zealand women's rugby union team at Buckingham Palace, where he exchanged hugs with the Black Ferns.</p>

<p>The rugby team also clicked a selfie with King Charles, in a memorable moment shared by the Black Ferns on social media.</p>

<p>It was New Zealand's winger Ayesha Leti-I'iga who broke the protocol and asked the King if he was okay to share hugs with the Black Ferns. To which King Charles did not waste any time and immediately agreed to it.</p>

<p>"We all wanted a hug, but only if it's okay with you," Leti-I'iga asked politely.</p>

<p>"A hug? Why not?" King Charles replied.</p>

<p>Currently, The Black Ferns are in the UK to take on England's Red Roses on Saturday at Twickenham.</p>

<p>Ahead of the match, Buckingham Palace hosted the New Zealand women's rugby union team to honour the visiting players.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) is set to lay off approximately 1,800 employees in the United States, marking its first major round of layoffs since 2009.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) is set to lay off approximately 1,800 employees in the United States, marking its first major round of layoffs since 2009. The job cuts, affecting about 2.5 per cent of the US workforce, span various roles, from associates to managing directors, and include business services, audit and tax. The cuts are primarily focused on the US advisory and products and technology operations, with about half of the affected employees based offshore.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The restructuring, which includes significant changes to its technology group, comes as the firm faces a slowdown in demand for parts of its advisory services.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">PwC US leader Paul Griggs announced the restructuring and layoffs to staff in a memo, obtained by the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/pwc-laying-off-1-800-employees-plans-restructuring-of-products-business-b5dfe7c1?mod=latest_headlines ">Wall Street Journal</a>, stating that the firm is “positioning our firm for the future, creating capacity to invest, and anticipating and reacting to the market opportunities of today and tomorrow.”</p>

<p dir="ltr">The announcement, made on September 11, also acknowledged the sombre anniversary of the firm's loss of five colleagues in the 2001 attacks.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">This development marks a significant shift for PwC, which had avoided layoffs in the US since 2009, unlike its peers Ernst &amp; Young (EY), Klynveld Peat Marwick Goerdeler (KPMG) and Deloitte.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">The restructuring will see PwC's products and technology teams more deeply integrated into individual business lines. The changes come as part of a broader structural overhaul initiated by Paul Griggs, who took over as US leader in May.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Tim Grady, PwC's US chief operating officer (COO), said, “To remain competitive and position our business for the future, we are continuing to transform areas of our firm and are aligning our workforce to better support our strategy,” as per the WSJ report.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, PwC's China office is also facing a crisis after losing a major client, Country Garden Holdings. This loss comes amid scrutiny over PwC's role in auditing China Evergrande Group, which is accused of a $78 billion fraud, Reuters reported.</p>

<p dir="ltr">As a result, PwC China has implemented cost-cutting measures and layoffs. Reuters reported on September 5 that over 50 Chinese firms, including Bank of China, have dropped PwC as their auditor or scrapped plans to rehire it.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Country Garden cited PwC's failure to meet the deadline for publishing its audited 2023 financial statements as the reason for its decision.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The act of doxxing by releasing someone's personal information without consent will be made a criminal offence in Australia under new government privacy laws.</p>

<p>Mark Dreyfus, Australia's Attorney-General, on Thursday, introduced legislation to Parliament that would make doxxing illegal and entitle victims of serious invasions of privacy to seek compensation through the court system, Xinhua news agency reported.</p>

<p>Under the laws, anyone found guilty of the malicious release of personal data online -- a practice known as doxxing -- will face jail time.</p>

<p>The legislation imposes a maximum penalty of six years in jail for publishing someone's personal information with the intent of causing harm.</p>

<p>The maximum prison sentence will be increased to seven years in cases where a person or group is targeted based on their religion, race, gender, disability, nationality or ethnic origin.</p>

<p>The move to criminalise doxxing is part of broader reforms that Dreyfus said would bring the existing Privacy Act into the digital age.</p>

<p>"Strong privacy laws are essential to Australians' trust and confidence in the digital economy and digital services provided by governments and industry," he said in a statement.</p>

<p>"Australians have got the right to have their privacy respected and when they're asked to hand over their personal data they have a right to expect it will be respected," the statement further read.</p>

<p>Additionally, the legislation introduced on Thursday would give Australians the right to sue for damages if they have been the victim of a serious invasion of privacy.</p>

<p>Dreyfus said the bill is the first stage of the government's commitment to provide Australians with greater control over their personal information.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Surfing, media-savvy Shinjiro Koizumi is the youthful, photogenic son of the popular former premier Junichiro Koizumi.</p>

<p>As environment minister, Koizumi backed greater use of renewables.</p>

<p>He also took paternity leave in the post, saying he wants to share parenting duties with his television presenter wife.</p>

<p>But this doesn't endear him to LDP elders, who might see Koizumi, 43, as too young and too lightweight to be prime minister.</p>

<h3><strong>Model-maker</strong></h3>

<p>Shigeru Ishiba is a former defence minister who is popular with voters but less so with LDP lawmakers, resulting in four failed attempts to be party leader.</p>

<p>The 67-year-old has questioned the Bank of Japan's maverick interest rate policy while calling for efforts to counter rural depopulation.</p>

<p>He likes making military models -- including one of a Soviet aircraft carrier for the visit of a Russian defence minister -- as well as trains and 1970s pop idols.</p>

<h3><strong>The nationalist</strong></h3>

<p>Sanae Takaichi is a vocal nationalist popular with the LDP's conservative wing. She was close to assassinated ex-premier Shinzo Abe, whose supporters are still powerful.</p>

<p>Takaichi, 63, is a regular visitor to the Yasukuni shrine to Japan's war dead -- including convicted war criminals -- so her nomination would likely rile China and South Korea.</p>

<p>Like Abe, Takaichi, who also ran for the leadership in 2021, backs aggressive monetary easing, active fiscal spending and nuclear power.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But unlike her hero Margaret Thatcher, the former British prime minister, she played drums in a student heavy metal band.</p>

<h3><strong>The liberal</strong></h3>

<p>Taro Kono, currently minister for digital transformation, is an experienced and outspoken reformist who was defeated by Prime Minister Fumio Kishida in the last leadership race in 2021.</p>

<p>US-educated Kono, 61, has held multiple minister jobs and has 2.5 million followers on X. His views are liberal-leaning by LDP standards.</p>

<p>Thirteen years after the Fukushima disaster, he has softened his opposition to nuclear power to meet growing energy demands, including from AI data centres.</p>

<h3><strong>The diplomat</strong></h3>

<p>Harvard-educated former consultant and current foreign minister Yoko Kamikawa is one of two women in the running along with Takaichi.</p>

<p>While justice minister, Kamikawa ordered 16 executions, including that of the head of the Aum doomsday cult responsible for the 1995 sarin gas attack on the Tokyo subway.</p>

<p>As Japan's top diplomat, the 71-year-old has won plaudits, including for a visit to Kyiv, but she reportedly struggled to secure the support needed to run as a candidate.</p>

<h3><strong>'Trump Whisperer'</strong></h3>

<p>With strong English, Abe's former golf partner Toshimitsu Motegi was dubbed the "Trump whisperer" for his deft handling of tricky US-Japan trade talks.</p>

<p>The Harvard-educated LDP secretary-general has been economy and foreign minister, and is respected for his policy knowledge.</p>

<p>But Motegi, 68, is reportedly feared for having a short fuse. Even Trump reportedly told Abe that he thought Motegi was "too tough".</p>

<h3><strong>The others</strong></h3>

<p>Former foreign minister and current chief cabinet secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi, former health minister Katsunobu Kato and former economic security minister Takayuki Kobayashi are also in the running.</p>

<p>Anything could happen, with the race more open this time around after most of the LDP's factions were disbanded in the wake of a funding scandal.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-09/c1d8v888_china_625x300_12_September_24.jpg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>

<p>China's Cyberspace Administration and its Ministry of Public Security have mooted an initiative to create internet identification for netizens in China. Plans are afoot to issue digital identification that will be used by netizens instead of their real identities when opening online profiles. The justification for this move is to safeguard users from sharing personal data, which may be retained by private digital platforms. While the authorities have maintained that applying for internet identification is voluntary, there is apprehension that the Communist Party of China (CPC) will exercise greater oversight over the Net in future.</p>

<p>These developments point to Chinese President Xi Jinping tightening his grip on civil society. The exercise is not limited to public life but seems to encompass the education sector and the military as well. The Party leadership met in mid-July for its yearly plenary session, which determined the direction of important policy initiatives. The resolution of the session announced plans to work on a unified national population management system.</p>

<h2><strong>Project Of 'National Rejuvenation'</strong></h2>

<p>A new set of regulations was issued recently with respect to educational institutions that seek to improve the pool of educators. The main aim of the Party-state is to uplift the societal status of teachers, enhancing their skills, and paring down their workload. Xi wants teachers to not merely impart lessons but to incubate a high-quality workforce for his vision of a modern Chinese economy. At the same time, the rules seek educators to be in sync with the Party's line on ideological matters, and draw the line with respect to any violations. According to government statistics, China has one of the largest combine of teachers, totalling over 18 million.</p>

<p>Concomitantly, students, too, are in the Party's crosshairs. In what may be seen as the importance of the education sector, China's political elite in its Politburo Standing Committee and officials across provinces attended Xi's address to mark Teachers' Day this month. While Xi made a pitch to expand academic exchanges overseas and research cooperation and sought a greater say in international education governance, he also underscored the need to impart more political training in classrooms.</p>

<p>He emphasised that this ideological guidance would serve as the foundation for his project of 'national rejuvenation', which seeks to build the nation's strength. There is also stress on fostering a 'sense of community' for the Chinese nation through the use of the official script and language.</p>

<h2><strong>Protecting Future Generations From 'Sabotage'</strong></h2>

<p>In an article published in the Communist Party of China's journal, <em>Qiushi</em>, Xi raised the bogey of hostile forces in the West trying to subvert the Party's leadership, and plans of a 'colour revolution' in China. He justifies the moves of the Party at exerting greater control in order to protect the future generation from sabotage, and create 'socialist successors'.</p>

<p>Chinese state-run media builds on Xi's thesis, warning of efforts by intelligence agencies to specifically target young students for recruitment and infiltration through social media. In a damage-control mode, new textbooks have been issued on the theme of national security that seek to wean students away from pop culture's potential for instigating a 'colour revolution'.</p>

<h2><strong>The Ideological Oversight Over PLA</strong></h2>

<p>In the realm of defence, Xi, as the chairperson of the Central Military Commission (CMC), which is tasked with oversight of the People's Liberation Army (PLA), highlighted the need for rectification in the services. China's Ministry of National Defence posted an article that credited Xi for tackling the challenge of "lax discipline" in the PLA ranks that endured during his predecessors' tenures. The commentary supported improved supervision mechanisms, citing Chairman Mao Zedong's Yan'an Rectification campaign. The ministry seeks better discipline within the ranks. The Yan'an campaign of the 1940s sought to improve the Party's ideological moorings with rank-and-file poring over Mao's speeches. Historians state that the rectification campaign's outcome was that cadres critical of Mao were on the Party's sidelines, with the Chairman strengthening his position.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Relying On 'Faithfuls'</strong></h2>

<p>In recent years, the issue of corruption in the armed forces has also come to light. Recently, two former defence ministers - Wei Fenghe and Li Shangfu - were expelled from the Party over accusations of bribery. In a conference of the military brass convened in June, incidentally in Yan'an, Xi stated his intent to come down heavily on corrupt elements and terminate the root causes of corruption. He already supports scrutiny of departments engaged in defence-related manufacturing by anti-corruption officials to unearth corruption.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Xi has underlined that the Party's strength lies in PLA's organisational accord and that the 'gun' (meaning the army) ought to be headed by those faithful to the Party. In line with this, the PLA is increasingly being staffed by "politically reliable" personnel in the upper echelons. For example, He Hongjun, who served as the executive deputy director of the Central Military Commission (CMC) Political Work Department, which is in charge of party-building and political education within the military, was named General.</p>

<h2><strong>A Flailing Economy</strong></h2>

<p>The triggers for Xi calling for greater control citing the bogeyman of a colour revolution lie in conditions that have developed as a result of his own policies. Chinese policymakers targeted a GDP (Gross Domestic Product) growth of around 5% this year but could achieve only up to 4.7% in the April to June quarter. Factory output has stalled and the sale of new flats is at an 18-year low. Unemployment remains high; the Party even stopped publishing the damaging statistics recently.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Second, labour unrest in the form of strikes in factories increased in the January-June period, according to China's official data. Social unrest has caught the Party unawares, as also evidenced by the demonstrations that broke out across China in December 2022 against COVID-19 restrictions. In the same year, protests against the Party took the form of many boycotting paying mortgages on property to financial institutions in light of the worsening economic situation due to the pandemic-induced curbs.</p>

<p>To conclude, as the economic situation worsens in China, Xi is tightening his grip on disparate sectors like military, education, and civil society interactions. Through greater social control, the Party seeks to protect itself from the fate of the Soviet Union, whose political model forms the foundation for China.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Peru's former president Alberto Fujimori, who ruled his country with an iron fist and then spent 16 years in prison for crimes against humanity, died on Wednesday at age 86 in the capital Lima.</p>

<p>"After a long battle with cancer, our father, Alberto Fujimori, has just departed to meet the Lord," his children Keiko, Hiro, Sachie and Kenji Fujimori wrote on social media platform X.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Thank you for so much, Dad!" they added.</p>

<p>Fujimori, who led Peru from 1990 to 2000, was released from prison on humanitarian grounds in December, two-thirds of the way through a 25-year sentence for crimes against humanity during his rule.</p>

<p>He was a key part of Peru's so-called war on terrorism in the form of Shining Path and Tupac Amaru leftist rebels. It left more than 69,000 people dead and 21,000 missing from 1980 to 2000, most of them civilians, according to a government truth commission.</p>

<p>Sources close to his family told AFP earlier Wednesday that Fujimori's health had deteriorated rapidly after completing treatment for tongue cancer in August.</p>

<p>He was last seen in public on Thursday as he was leaving a clinic in the Miraflores district of Lima, where he said he had undergone a CT scan.</p>

<p>As news of his death spread quickly on social media, supporters and detractors quarrelled over his legacy.</p>

<p>Many Peruvians called Fujimori, who was of Japanese descent, "el chino," or the Chinese man.</p>

<p>After his death Wednesday supporters gathered outside his house chanting "El chino did not die! El chino is present!"</p>

<p>Just a month earlier his daughter Keiko had announced that the rightwinger would run for president again in 2026.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Gustavo Adrianzen expressed his condolences to the Fujimori family. "We want his children and relatives to know we feel sorrow," he said.</p>

<p>Adrianzen said he would talk to the family about what kind of funeral they want. It was not clear whether Fujimori would receive a state funeral.</p>

<p>Fujimori was convicted and sent to prison in 2009 over massacres committed by army death squads in 1991 and 1992 in which 25 people, including a child, were killed in what he presented as anti-terrorist operations.</p>

<p>In December 2017, then-president Pedro Pablo Kuczynski pardoned Fujimori due to his ill health.</p>

<p>But the Supreme Court later annulled the pardon and in January 2019, he was returned to jail from hospital.</p>

<h3><strong>Hostage crisis&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>He was released again in December 2023 after a court reinstated his pardon.</p>

<p>He was adored and reviled in equal measures in Peru.</p>

<p>As he turned 80 in 2018, Fujimori sent a message to AFP which read in part: "Let history judge what I got right and what I got wrong."</p>

<p>He also expressed the conviction that he had paved the way for Peru to become one of the leading countries of Latin America.</p>

<p>Supporters credited him with saving the nation from left-wing Shining Path and Tupac Amaru guerrillas and shoring up the economy.</p>

<p>Opponents saw him as a power-thirsty autocrat.</p>

<p>Sociologist Eduardo Toche expressed scathing criticism of Fujimori when he was convicted of crimes against humanity in 2009, saying the Fujimori government represented the lowest, worst point in the history of Peru as he made up his own rules and ignored the country's institutions.</p>

<p>"For him there was no legal framework. The legal framework was that of his will and that of his friends, nothing more," Toche told AFP at the time.</p>

<p>One of the most dramatic episodes of his presidency was a four-month hostage ordeal at the Japanese embassy in Lima in late 1996 and early 1997.</p>

<p>The standoff ended with Fujimori sending in commandos who rescued all 72 hostages and killed 14 rebels.</p>

<p>But the later Fujimori years were dominated by a bribery scandal involving his intelligence chief Vladimiro Montesinos.</p>

<p>Fujimori went into self-imposed exile in Japan and memorably faxed in his resignation but was arrested years later in Chile and sent back to Peru for trial.</p>

<p>His daughter Keiko has made three failed bids for the presidency.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The number of people killed after Typhoon Yagi swept through northern Vietnam bringing flash floods and landslides has risen to 197, the government said Thursday.</p>

<p>About 128 people are still missing and more than 250,000 hectares of crops have also been destroyed, disaster officials under the Ministry of Agriculture said in an official report.</p>

<p>Yagi is the most powerful typhoon to hit northern Vietnam in 30 years, according to meteorologists.</p>

<p>The storm downed bridges, tore roofs off buildings and damaged factories after making landfall on Saturday carrying winds in excess of 149 kilometres (92 miles) per hour.</p>

<p>The north of the country has since been battling severe flooding, with several communities partially underwater.</p>

<p>Thousands have been forced to evacuate their homes, while others are struggling with power cuts.</p>

<p>In one badly hit district on the outskirts of Hanoi, more than 15,000 people have been affected by the floods.</p>

<p>Farmers have also suffered. About 1.5 million chickens and ducks have been killed, as well as 2,500 pigs, buffalo and cows, officials said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kamala Harris and Donald Trump return to the campaign trail Thursday, with the Democrat hoping her dominant display in their first presidential debate will boost her chances in the knife-edge US election.</p>

<p>The rivals are heading to crucial battleground states that will decide November's vote, two days after Harris forced Republican Trump onto the defensive in a fiery clash that drew 67 million viewers across the United States.</p>

<p>But it remains unclear whether the vice president's punchy performance will turn the dial with less than two months to go in an agonizingly tight race that will be decided by a handful of undecided voters across the country.</p>

<p>Harris, 59, will seek to capitialize on her debate momentum as she heads to North Carolina on Thursday, holding back-to-back rallies in the cities of Charlotte and Greensboro promising a "new way forward."</p>

<p>Harris has erased a six-point Trump lead over the last month to draw level in North Carolina, where she is aiming to fire up crucial Black and young voters to back her bid to become America's first woman commander in chief.</p>

<p>Amid media reports of turmoil in his camp over the way Harris succeeded in goading him at the debate, the 78-year-old former president is due onstage in Tucson, Arizona to focus on "our struggling economy."</p>

<p>Arizona was one of the most bitterly fought states in the 2020 election, with Joe Biden winning there by around 10,000 votes against Trump, and promises to be closely contested again.</p>

<p>Their return to the swing states at the heart of the election came a day after a brief truce when they attended Wednesday's anniversary of the 9/11 attacks in New York.</p>

<h3><strong>'Missed opportunity'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>The debate in Philadelphia was a welcome boost for Harris as the honeymoon from her sudden replacement of the ageing Biden as Democratic candidate seemed to be wearing off.</p>

<p>Trump insisted it was one of his best debates, but snap polls and even allies disagreed as Harris riled him up with taunts about crowd sizes and his 2020 election loss, then scored points on issues like abortion.</p>

<p>Close Trump ally Senator Lindsay Graham told reporters afterwards that it was a "missed opportunity" while US media reported there was discontent among Trump donors.</p>

<p>But while Harris has erased the lead Trump held in polls, the candidates remain neck and neck and she insists she is the underdog in the White House race.</p>

<p>And America's deeply polarized politics mean however that big showpiece events like debates rarely move the polls that much -- even if it was a disastrous debate against Trump that forced Biden to drop his reelection bid.</p>

<p>Both candidates will keep bashing the battlegrounds in the coming days, knowing a few thousand undecided votes in the northeastern "Rust Belt" and the booming southern "Sun Belt" could decide everything.</p>

<p>Harris returns to Pennsylvania, the most crucial and bitterly fought of all the swing states, on Friday for campaign events in Johnstown and Wilkes-Barre before attending an awards dinner Saturday with Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff.</p>

<p>Trump will deliver remarks in Las Vegas on Friday on the cost of living, as he targets Nevada, yet another key swing state. He is also due to give a press conference in Los Angeles.</p>

<p>Harris's running mate Tim Walz will travel to Michigan and Wisconsin from Thursday to Saturday as part of the campaign's New Way Forward swing state tour.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Taylor Swift endorsed Kamala Harris over Donald Trump in an Instagram post on Tuesday, calling her a "steady-handed, gifted leader."]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump's running mate JD Vance today took a dig at American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift after she endorsed Kamala Harris. Swift voiced support for the Democratic candidate in an Instagram post on Tuesday, calling her a "steady-handed, gifted leader."</p>

<p>She signed off her post - which has so far <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/taylor-swifts-instagram-post-endorsing-kamala-harris-draws-9-million-likes-6545522" target="_blank">drawn nearly 10 million likes</a> - by dubbing herself a "childless cat lady," a swipe at a JD Vance, who in a 2021 interview called some Democrats "a bunch of childless cat ladies." He has since said it was merely a sarcastic remark.</p>

<p>"We admire Taylor Swift's music, but I don't think most Americans, whether they like her music or are fans of hers or not, are going to be influenced by a billionaire celebrity who I think is fundamentally disconnected from the interests and the problems of most Americans," Vance told Fox News.</p>

<p>"When grocery prices go by 20%, it hurts most Americans. It doesn't hurt Taylor Swift. When housing prices become unaffordable, it doesn't affect Taylor Swift or any other billionaire. It does affect middle-class Americans all over our country," he added.</p>

<h3><strong>Taylor Swift Endorses Kamala Harris</strong></h3>

<p>"I'm voting for Kamala Harris because she fights for the rights and causes I believe need a warrior to champion them," the 34-year-old singer said in a long post on Instagram.</p>

<p>"I believe we can accomplish so much more in this country if we are led by calm and not chaos," she added.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[For Mr Gates, the key question during a future pandemic would be whether nations are better prepared than they were for the outbreak of Covid-19.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates has repeatedly warned the public about pressing issues like climate disasters and devastating cyberattacks. However, the two crises that concern him the most are war and pandemics.</p>

<p>The Microsoft co-founder told CNBC Make It that the current global unrest could potentially trigger "a major war," and even if a large-scale conflict is avoided, "there will be another pandemic, most likely in the next 25 years."</p>

<p>For Mr Gates, the key question during a future pandemic would be whether nations are better prepared than they were for the outbreak of Covid-19. Reflecting on the United States' response, he noted, "The country that the world expected to lead and be the model fell short of those expectations."</p>

<p>In his 2022 book, "How to Prevent the Next Pandemic," Mr Gates criticised various governments for their lack of preparedness in 2020. He also outlined recommendations for countries worldwide, including stronger quarantine measures, enhanced disease monitoring, and increased investment in vaccine research and development.</p>

<p>Speaking about Covid-19, Mr Gates remarked, "Although some lessons from the coronavirus pandemic have been learned, it's been far less than I would have expected, sadly. We're still not fully reflecting on what we did well and where we fell short. Maybe in the next five years, that will improve, but so far, it's quite surprising."</p>

<p>Earlier,&nbsp;Microsoft co-founder said that the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) will be transformative for people in the next five years. Speaking to CNN, he added that there is no need to be scared of the latest technology as it will create new opportunities. The comment comes days after International Monetary Fund (IMF) chief Kristalina Georgieva said that AI will affect 60 per cent of jobs in advanced economies and 40 per cent across the globe.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On the 23rd anniversary of the September 11 attacks, NASA released a letter from the only American astronaut in space at the time, Frank Culbertson, who was reflecting on witnessing the tragedy from the International Space Station (ISS).</p>

<p>In the letter, dated September 12, 2001, Culbertson recollects the moment he learned of the attacks while being aboard the International Space Station (ISS). Describing his shock and horror upon hearing about the events, he wrote, "Well, obviously the world changed today. What I say or do is very minor compared to the significance of what happened to our country today when it was attacked by.... by whom? Terrorists is all we know, I guess. Hard to know at whom to direct our anger and fear..."</p>

<p>Culbertson, who was serving as the commander of Expedition Three at that time, captured images of the smoke plume rising from lower Manhattan shortly after the collapse of the Twin Towers. His letter vividly narrates his experience of seeing his country under one of the biggest terrorist attacks of all time that killed 3000 people.</p>

<p>"It's difficult to describe how it feels to be the only American completely off the planet at a time such as this. The feeling that I should be there with all of you, dealing with this, helping in some way, is overwhelming," he wrote.</p>

<p>Culbertson&nbsp;witnessed the smoke rising from New York City as they passed overhead. He captured video footage of the smoke, which he described as having an "odd bloom" at its base. He later learned that the pilot of the plane that hit the Pentagon was his classmate, Captain Charles Burlingame.</p>

<p>Today, 23 years after the attack, a memorial exists where the Twin Towers once stood to remember those who lost their lives in the terror attack. Pew Research in its study said, "It is difficult to think of an event that so profoundly transformed US public opinion across so many dimensions as the 9/11 attacks." Culbertson's photograph and his letter serve as a lasting record of that fateful day in American history, noting that things would "never be the same again" after that.&nbsp;</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Mr Niccol, 50, is seen by many as a "dream hire" and a "hall of fame restaurant CEO."]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Brian Niccol, a seasoned executive with a proven track record of turning around troubled companies, has taken the helm at Starbucks. The coffee giant faces mounting pressure from activist investors, unionization efforts, and sluggish sales in its two largest markets.</p>

<p>Mr Niccol, 50, who previously led Chipotle through a foodborne illness scandal and the pandemic, is seen by many as a "dream hire" and a "hall of fame restaurant CEO."&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a commencement speech, Niccol shared his go-to career advice. "I know it's a cliche, but you absolutely have to believe in yourself and have the grit to not give up, when it at first might not be going your way,” &nbsp;He also shared his strategy of using a beat-up notebook to track his career progress and stay focused on his goals, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/09/starbucks-new-ceo-brian-niccol-swears-by-this-cliche-career-advice.html" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>CNBC Make It </em></a>reported.</p>

<p>Mr Niccol's "gut instinct" has played a crucial role in his career decisions, including his move from Taco Bell to Chipotle.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Whatever it is you need to do to keep yourself focused on your goal, do it, and believe you can do it,” he added.</p>

<p>“There will be times in your career when your gut will be tingling,” he said, noting that he had that feeling when he left Taco Bell to become Chipotle's CEO in 2018. “Make space for that instinctive intelligence and take action. Trust your instincts.”&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Niccol's appointment is critical for Starbucks. The company has been grappling with several challenges, including declining sales, increased competition, and unionization efforts. Niccol's experience in turning around troubled companies could be a valuable asset to Starbucks as it seeks to navigate these challenges.</p>

<p>In addition to his strong leadership skills, Mr Niccol also has a deep understanding of the restaurant industry. He has spent his entire career working in the food service sector, and he has a proven track record of driving growth and profitability.</p>

<p>Mr Niccol's appointment has been met with optimism by many analysts and investors. They believe that he has the potential to turn Starbucks around and restore the company to its former glory. However, it will take time to see whether Niccol can deliver on these expectations.</p>

<p>"When I talked to him I remember him saying, 'I know what to do,'" Hobson, who ceded her position as chair of the Starbucks board to Niccol and is now lead independent director, said in an Aug. 13 appearance on CNBC's "Squawk Box."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hobson continued: "He said, 'This is a speed bump in this company's history. This is not something that I fear going into,' and that was something for our board that was extremely encouraging."&nbsp;</p>

<p>In his new role, Mr Niccol will be getting paid a base salary of $1.6 million annually and supercommuting from his home in Newport Beach, California to Starbucks' Seattle headquarters on a corporate jet.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A homeless man has been convicted of stabbing a college student 46 times and recording the brutal attack in US' Los Angeles, reports said. In the audio recording, the man can be heard promising not to hurt her.</p>

<p>According to prosecutors, 34-year-old Shawn Laval Smith was "hunting for a woman alone" in 2022 when he found 24-year-old Brianna Kupfer at the furniture store where she worked.</p>

<p>When he entered the store, Ms Kupfer sent a text message to her friend saying she felt uncomfortable about a man who was inside the shop, they said.</p>

<p>Around 20 minutes after that text, she was found dead on the floor covered in blood.</p>

<p>The audio recorded by Smith was key in convicting him of the horrific murder. In the clip, a man can be heard saying he was "not gonna hurt" a woman and ordered her to "just get down on the floor."</p>

<p>A woman can be heard screaming as the man says, "It's over, it's over, it's over, it's over."</p>

<p>After the stabbing, he fled the furniture store through the back door and left Ms Kupfer bleeding to death.</p>

<p>Prosecutors say Smith had planned to attack a woman who alone and left his house prepared to kill. Ms Kupfer's lawyer called him a Hannibal Lecter-style sicko who liked the idea of slaughtering women, the New York Post said.</p>

<p>"This man hated women. It's easier probably to sleep at night to think something is wrong with him rather than face the truth that this man was on a crusade to hunt, to destroy and to kill for the mere fact that she was female," he said.</p>

<p>At the crime scene, the police found an audio recorded and a filet knife (used to slice and prepare fish). The knife had bent after the frenzied attack.</p>

<p>Both the items were covered in his DNA which was key in proving his guilt.</p>

<p>Smith, who had a long criminal history including assaulting police officer and vandalism, was out on bail after he was accused of firing a flare gun from a vehicle.</p>

<p>"Brianna Kupfer was a promising young woman whose life was tragically taken far too soon. I thank the jury for their thoughtful deliberation and dedication in finding the defendant guilty," Ms Kupfer's lawyer said in a statement after the verdict.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pop megastar Taylor Swift drew more than 9 million "likes" to her Instagram post backing Vice President Kamala Harris for president from celebrities that included Jennifer Aniston, US basketball star Caitlin Clark and Selena Gomez. Soon after Harris, a Democrat, finished debating her Republican rival Donald Trump on Tuesday night, Swift, 34, told her 283 million followers that Harris and running mate Tim Walz would get her vote in the Nov. 5 election.</p>

<p>Her post encouraged first-time voters to be sure to register for the election, and a US General Services Administration spokesperson reported on Wednesday receiving 337,826 visitors at vote.gov from a custom URL that <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/taylor-swift-endorses-kamala-harris-on-instagram-after-debate-with-trump-6537920">Taylor Swift</a> had shared.</p>

<p>"I'm voting for @kamalaharris because she fights for the rights and causes I believe need a warrior to champion them," Swift posted.</p>

<p>She called Harris a "steady-handed, gifted leader" who could lead the country with calm rather than chaos.</p>

<p>Swift was pictured with her cat in her post, which she signed as "Childless Cat Lady" in a dig at Trump's running mate JD Vance, who in a 2021 interview called some Democrats "a bunch of childless cat ladies." He has since said it was merely a sarcastic remark.</p>

<p>Supermodel Karlie Kloss, who is married to Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner's brother, liked Swift's post.</p>

<p>"Parks and Recreation" and "The White Lotus" actor Aubrey Plaza echoed Swift's endorsement in her own Instagram post on Wednesday, where she held a cat alongside the caption "HARRIS WALZ" with an American flag emoji.</p>

<p>Trump supporter <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/fine-taylor-you-win-elon-musk-after-taylor-swift-backs-kamala-harris-6538352">Elon Musk</a>, who is chief executive of Tesla and owns social media platform X, wrote on his platform, "Fine Taylor ... you win ... I will give you a child and guard your cats with my life."</p>

<p>His message was branded "disgusting," "misogynistic" and "creepy."</p>

<p>"I've done my research, and I've made my choice," Swift wrote to her followers on Instagram. "Your research is all yours to do, and the choice is yours to make. I also want to say, especially to first time voters: Remember that in order to vote, you have to be registered!"</p>

<p>Swift wrote that she was impressed by Walz, the Minnesota governor, and described him as someone "who has been standing up for LGBTQ+ rights, IVF, and a woman's right to her own body for decades."</p>

<p>Walz, who was on MSNBC when the endorsement was announced, said he was "incredibly grateful" and urged the singer's large fan base of "Swifties" to "Get things going."</p>

<p>Shortly after Swift's endorsement, the Harris-Walz campaign announced pre-orders for its latest campaign wear: Swift fan inspired friendship bracelets.</p>

<h3><strong>TRUMP DISMISSES ENDORSEMENT</strong></h3>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/shell-pay-for-it-says-donald-trump-after-taylor-swift-endorses-kamala-harris-for-president-6542169">Donald Trump</a> on Wednesday dismissed Swift's endorsement of Harris, saying he "was not a Taylor fan".</p>

<p>"It was just a question of time," Trump told Fox News in an interview. "She's a very liberal person. She seems to always endorse a Democrat. And she'll probably pay a price for it ... in the marketplace."</p>

<p>In August, Trump posted a fake social media image of Swift asking people to vote for him in the November election.</p>

<p>Swift referred to that in her Tuesday post, saying Trump had "really conjured up my fears around AI, and the dangers of spreading misinformation."</p>

<p>She added: "It brought me to the conclusion that I need to be very transparent about my actual plans for this election as a voter."</p>

<p>Opinion polls show the race essentially tied between the two candidates.</p>

<p>Harris, who supports abortion rights, has criticized Trump for appointing three of the Supreme Court justices who in 2022 helped overturn the 1973 Roe v Wade ruling ensuring a constitutional right to abortion.</p>

<p>Trump has defended the court's abortion ruling but said a federal abortion ban is unnecessary and that the issue should be resolved at the state level.</p>

<p>Swift backed President Joe Biden in 2020. Many Hollywood actors, producers and filmmakers have said they view Harris, a former U.S. senator from California, as their hometown candidate.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden donned one of his predecessor and adversary Donald Trump's signature red hats on Wednesday in a move the White House said was a show of "unity" on the anniversary of the September 11, 2001 attacks.</p>

<p>The veteran Democrat was dared to put on the cap as he attended commemorative events with Vice President Kamala Harris -- Trump's opponent in the November presidential election -- at the Pennsylvania site where Flight 93 crashed.</p>

<p>"At the Shanksville Fire Station, President Joe Biden spoke about the country's bipartisan unity after 9/11 and said we needed to get back to that," White House spokesperson Andrew Bates posted on X.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"As a gesture, he gave a hat to a Trump supporter who then said that in the same spirit, (Biden) should put on his Trump cap. He briefly wore it."</p>

<p>Biden, 81, who was replaced by Harris on the Democratic ticket after withdrawing from the race in July, has repeatedly characterized Trump as an existential threat to US democracy.</p>

<p>Video and still images of the president in the hat, bearing the slogan "Trump 2024," quickly went viral.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Several commenters noted that the episode came the day after a prime-time televised presidential debate between Trump and Democratic nominee Kamala Harris, in which the Republican told his opponent: "Biden hates you."</p>

<p>The Trump campaign's War Room rapid reaction account quipped that Biden had put the cap on because "Kamala did so bad in last night's debate."</p>

<p>In reality, Trump is considered by neutral observers to have had a poor night, coming across as defensive, unprepared, and obsessed with the past and personal grievances.</p>

<p>Across three national polls conducted since the showdown on ABC, an average of 57 percent of viewers said Harris turned in the better debate performance, while only 34 percent said Trump came out on top.</p>

<p>Earlier on Wednesday, Harris and Trump shook hands at New York's 9/11 memorial.</p>

<p>Wearing commemorative blue ribbons, they watched with other assembled dignitaries, including Biden, as the names of the almost 3,000 victims of the attacks on the Twin Towers were read out.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kamala Harris and Donald Trump shook hands Wednesday at New York's 9/11 memorial to mark the anniversary of the attacks, briefly putting politics aside hours after they clashed in a fiery presidential debate.</p>

<p>The solemn display of unity was a stark contrast to the evening before, when the Democratic vice president forced the rattled Republican former president onto the defensive in a bruising televised encounter.</p>

<p>Any sense of harmony from the commemoration of the 2001 Al-Qaeda attacks is likely to be short-lived, with the US election still on a knife-edge with less than eight weeks to go, despite polls showing a crushing debate win for Harris.</p>

<p>The 78-year-old Trump came out swinging even before the ceremony, claiming -- without evidence -- in an interview with Fox News that the ABC News debate in Philadelphia was "rigged" against him.</p>

<p>"It was a rigged deal, as I assumed it would be, because when you looked at the fact that they were correcting everything and not correcting with her," he complained -- referring to pushback from the moderators to some of his brazenly false statements.</p>

<p>The debate was watched by 57.5 million Americans, according to preliminary figures from ratings agency Nielsen -- more than the 51.3 million who watched the catastrophic performance in June that forced President Joe Biden out of the race.</p>

<p>Trump appeared to be in two minds about the Harris campaign's call for a second debate. He initially said on social media "why would I do a rematch?" but later said he'd be ready for two more.</p>

<p><strong>- 'Stand in solidarity' -</strong></p>

<p>The rivals kept their animosity hidden at the Ground Zero memorial, however, in an extraordinary encounter that also included the outgoing president.</p>

<p>Biden, 81, looked on as Harris and Trump shared their second handshake in the space of a few hours -- having had their first ever such greeting at the start of the debate, in an unexpected move initiated by Harris.</p>

<p>Wearing commemorative blue ribbons, they all then watched as the names of the almost 3,000 victims of the attacks on the Twin Towers were read out.</p>

<p>"We stand in solidarity with their families and loved ones. We also honor the extraordinary heroism on display that fateful day by ordinary Americans helping their fellow Americans," Harris said in a statement.</p>

<p>She and Biden headed later to the site in Pennsylvania where a hijacked plane crashed on 9/11, with Trump following later.</p>

<p>During his visit, Biden briefly donned a red "Trump 2024" cap given to him by a Trump-supporting firefighter. The image went viral but the White House said it was a gesture of "unity."</p>

<p>Biden and Harris later visited the site where another jet was flown into the Pentagon outside Washington in 2001.</p>

<p><strong>- 'Good job' -</strong></p>

<p>The solemn atmosphere could not have been more different to Wednesday night's debate.</p>

<p>Both candidates declared victory but it was former prosecutor Harris who landed blows on issues including abortion, and repeatedly managed to bait convicted felon Trump into angry remarks on past grievances.</p>

<p>Trump also boosted a debunked claim about migrants eating pet cats and dogs in Ohio, earning a correction from the ABC moderator.</p>

<p>A CNN snap poll said Harris performed better than Trump by 63 percent to 37, while a YouGov poll said Harris laid out a clearer plan by 43 to 32 percent.</p>

<p>US media and commentators broadly agreed Harris had come out on top -- but that it may not move the dial much in a deeply polarized and entrenched electorate.</p>

<p>"I thought Kamala did a good job... and kind of gave us hope," Tanya James, a retired teacher from Texas, said Wednesday outside the White House.</p>

<p>Ikaika Juliano, a musician from Florida, thought however that the Democratic contender "is fake."</p>

<p>Harris meanwhile got a boost with pop megastar Taylor Swift offering her backing minutes after the debate. Trump said Swift would "probably pay a price for it in the marketplace."</p>

<p>But the race remains neck and neck going into the final stretch.</p>

<p>Harris heads Thursday to North Carolina and Trump is due onstage in Arizona, two of the half-dozen swing states expected to decide the election.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;A group of private astronauts is set to carry out the first private spacewalk in orbit on Thursday from a SpaceX capsule, testing a new line of spacesuits.</p>

<p>A billionaire entrepreneur, a retired military fighter pilot and two SpaceX employees have been orbiting Earth aboard SpaceX's Crew Dragon since their pre-dawn launch from Florida on Tuesday for the Polaris Dawn mission, the company's latest and riskiest bid to push the boundaries of commercial spaceflight.</p>

<p>The spacewalk is slated to begin at 2:23 a.m. ET (0623 GMT) while the crew is 700 km (435 miles) in altitude, with two astronauts venturing outside Crew Dragon while the other two remain inside. The capsule will be completely depressurized, and the whole crew will need to rely on their slimmed-down SpaceX-developed spacesuits for oxygen.</p>

<p>Jared Isaacman, 41, a pilot and the billionaire founder of electronic payment company Shift4, is bankrolling the Polaris mission, as he did for his Inspiration4 flight with SpaceX in 2021. He has declined to say how much he is paying for the missions, but they are likely to cost hundreds of millions of dollars based on Crew Dragon's roughly $55 million per-seat price for other flights.</p>

<p>The others in Polaris include mission pilot Scott Poteet, 50, a retired U.S. Air Force lieutenant colonel, and SpaceX employees Sarah Gillis, 30, and Anna Menon, 38, both senior engineers at the company.</p>

<p>Isaacman and Gillis will exit the spacecraft tethered by an oxygen line while Poteet and Menon stay inside the cabin.</p>

<p>Only government astronauts with several years of training have done spacewalks in the past. There have been roughly 270 on the International Space Station (ISS) since its creation in 2000, and 16 by Chinese astronauts on Beijing's Tiangong space station.</p>

<p>The first U.S. spacewalk was in 1965, aboard a Gemini capsule, and used a similar procedure to the one planned for Polaris Dawn: the capsule was depressurised, the hatch opened, and a spacesuited astronaut ventured outside on a tether.</p>

<p>The private Polaris astronauts during the mission will be key subjects for a range of scientific research into how the human body reacts to deep space, adding to decades of astronaut health studies enabled by government astronauts on the ISS.</p>

<p>Crew Dragon, the only U.S. vehicle capable of reliably putting humans in orbit and returning them to Earth, since 2021 has flown more than a dozen astronaut missions, mainly for NASA. The agency seeded development of the capsule under a program meant to establish commercial, privately built U.S. vehicles capable of ferrying U.S. astronauts to and from the ISS.</p>

<p>Boeing's Starliner capsule was also developed under that NASA program, but it is farther behind. Starliner launched its first astronauts to the ISS in June in a troubled test mission that ended this month with the capsule coming back empty, leaving its crew on the space station for a Crew Dragon capsule to fetch next year.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>North Korea fired multiple short range ballistic missiles into waters east of the Korean peninsula Thursday, Seoul's military reported, days after the nuclear-armed North marked a state anniversary.</p>

<p>Seoul's Joint Chief of Staff said it had detected multiple "short-range ballistic missiles launched into the East Sea around 07:10 from Pyongyang today (2210 GMT on Wednesday)," referring to the body of water also known as the Sea of Japan.</p>

<p>It said it was analysing details of the launch and "closely sharing information on the North Korean ballistic missile with the U.S. and Japanese authorities, while strengthening surveillance and vigilance in preparation for further launches".</p>

<p>Japan's defence ministry also confirmed the launch of at least one suspected North Korean ballistic missile, with the coastguard warning vessels to take care.</p>

<p>It is Pyongyang's first apparent weapons test since July 1, and comes days after the isolated, nuclear-armed country marked a key anniversary celebrating the founding of the ruling regime.</p>

<p>North Korea has regularly launched missiles around September 9, its foundation day, including conducting its fifth nuclear test on the same day in 2016.</p>

<p>The country's sixth nuclear test was conducted on September 3 in 2017.</p>

<p>At a speech to mark the 76th anniversary of its founding this week, leader Kim Jong Un said the country was moving to steadily increase its nuclear arsenal.</p>

<p>North Korea "will steadily strengthen its nuclear force capable of fully coping with any threatening acts imposed by its nuclear-armed rival states", Kim said.</p>

<p>- Trash balloons -<br />
Relations between North and South Korea are at one of their lowest points in years, with the North recently announcing the deployment of 250 ballistic missile launchers to its southern border.</p>

<p>The North has also been bombarding the South with trash-carrying balloons, including a five-day straight blitz last week.</p>

<p>North Korea has sent more than 5,000 trash-filled balloons south since May, saying they are retaliation for propaganda balloons launched northwards by South Korean activists.</p>

<p>In response, Seoul has suspended a tension-reducing military deal with Pyongyang and restarted some propaganda broadcasts from loudspeakers along the border.</p>

<p>North Korea has recently bolstered military ties with Moscow, and analysts have said the North could be testing and ramping up production of artillery and cruise missiles before sending them to Russia for use in Ukraine.</p>

<p>The United States and Seoul have accused North Korea of supplying ammunition and missiles for Russia's war effort, a claim Pyongyang has called "absurd".</p>

<p>Earlier this year, Pyongyang declared the South its "principal enemy".</p>

<p>It has shuttered agencies dedicated to reunification and threatened war over "even 0.001 mm" of territorial infringement.</p>

<p>The North's latest ballistic missile launch comes weeks after South Korea and the United States wrapped their annual Ulchi Freedom Shield joint military drills.</p>

<p>North Korea -- which attacked its neighbour in 1950, triggering the Korean War -- has always been infuriated by joint US-South Korean military exercises, decrying them as rehearsals for invasion.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A former CIA officer was sentenced on Wednesday to 10 years in prison after pleaded guilty to spying for China, the U.S. Justice Department said.</p>

<p>Alexander Yuk Ching Ma, 71, reached a plea agreement with prosecutors in May in exchange for pleading guilty to conspiring to gather and deliver to China national defense information, the DOJ said in a statement.</p>

<p>Ma, who worked for the CIA from 1982 to 1989, conspired with a relative, now deceased, who was also employed by the CIA, the DOJ said. They were contacted by Chinese intelligence officers in March 2001 and handed over "a large volume" of classified defense information in exchange for $50,000, the department said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Palestinian Hamas group said on Wednesday that its negotiators reiterated its readiness to implement an "immediate" ceasefire with Israel in Gaza based on a previous U.S. proposal without new conditions from any party.</p>

<p>The Palestinian group said in a statement that their negotiation team, led by senior official Khalil al-Hayya, met mediators on Wednesday including Qatar's Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani and Egypt's intelligence chief Abbas Kamel in Doha to discuss the latest developments in Gaza.</p>

<p>Talks have so far failed to reach a deal to end the 11-month-old war. Lingering issue include control of the Philadelphi corridor, a narrow stretch of land on Gaza's border with Egypt, persisting.</p>

<p>CIA Director William Burns, who is also the chief U.S. negotiator on Gaza, said on Saturday that a more detailed ceasefire proposal would be made in the next several days.</p>

<p>The previous proposal put forward by U.S. President Joe Biden in June laid out a three-phase ceasefire in return for the release of Israeli hostages.</p>

<p>The recent war in Gaza started after Hamas militants attacked Israel on Oct. 7 killing 1,200 people and taking about 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. Israel's offensive has thus far killed at least 41,084 Palestinians and wounded 95,029 others, the Gaza health ministry says.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

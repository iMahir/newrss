       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Anmol Bishnoi, the younger sibling of gangster Lawrence Bishnoi, was arrested in the US a few days ago for entering that country with illegal documents, sources told <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/gangster-lawrence-bishnois-brother-anmol-bishnoi-arrested-in-us-sources-7048663">NDTV</a>. The 26-year-old is wanted in several high-profile cases, including the 2022 murder of Punjabi singer Sidhu Moosewala. He is also accused in last month's killing of ex-Maharashtra minister Baba Siddique and the firing incident outside actor Salman Khan's Mumbai home in June 2024.</p>

<p>Bishnoi is currently at the Pottawattamie County Jail in Iowa, a facility known as the ‘Squirrel Cage Jail.'<br />
<br />
<strong>All about the Squirrel Cage Jail</strong><br />
<br />
The Squirrel Cage Jail, an architectural marvel with a chilling history, was constructed in 1885 on the grounds of a former church morgue. One of the only three remaining revolving jails in the US, it is renowned for its eerie and unsettling design. The jail is unique for its rotating cells that revolve within a circular structure to align with a single door. This peculiar design allowed jailers to rotate the cells to reach the desired prisoner, an architectural feature that continues to intrigue and unsettle visitors.</p>

<p>The facility was used as a jail until 1969. In 1971, it was acquired by the Council Bluffs Park Board for preservation and transformed into a museum by the Historical Society of Pottawattamie County (HSPS). Since its conversion, the jail has attracted considerable attention, particularly for its paranormal reputation. Reports of strange occurrences, such as unexplained footsteps and whispers, have surfaced for decades, particularly from staff and visitors to the site.</p>

<p>“Many of the jail staff and volunteers have heard footsteps, voices, whispers and doors moving. Some have even seen dark shadows moving across the stairs or past doorways,” an article on the Council Bluffs website quoted Kat Slaughter, the museum's manager, as saying.</p>

<p>The haunting at the jail has been linked to a series of tragic events over the years. At least four known deaths occurred within the building. A prisoner died of a heart attack, another fell from a great height while attempting to carve his name on the ceiling, a third died by suicide and a guard was fatally shot during a mishap with riot training equipment.</p>

<p>Paranormal experts have conducted multiple investigations at the site, with some capturing unexplained phenomena, including Electronic Voice Phenomena (EVPs) and visual evidence of shadows. Slaughter notes that investigators have recorded electromagnetic field (EMF) anomalies in areas where there should be none, further adding to the jail's mystique.</p>

<p>According to the HSPS, the walls of this jail bear the scratched signatures and dates of many of its infamous prisoners. These markings stand as proof of the jail's grim past, which is unlikely to be replicated in a modern facility, stated HSPS on its website.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Lucy was often described as "the grandmother of humanity", but more recent discoveries suggest she may have been more like an aunt or a cousin, experts say.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>She was, for a while, the oldest known member of the human family. Fifty years after the discovery of Lucy in Ethiopia, the remarkable remains continue to yield theories and questions.</p>

<p>In a non-descript room in the National Museum of Ethiopia, the 3.18-million-year-old bones are delicately removed from a safe and placed on a long table.</p>

<p>They consist of fossilised dental remains, skull fragments, parts of the pelvis and femur that make up the world's most famous Australopithecus afarensis, Lucy.</p>

<p>The hominid was discovered on November 24, 1974, in the Afar region of northeast Ethiopia by a team of scientists led by Maurice Taieb, Yves Coppens, Donald Johanson, Jon Kalb, and Raymonde Bonnefille.</p>

<p>The 52 bone fragments, amounting to some 40 percent of Lucy's skeleton, was, at the time, the most complete ever found, and revolutionised the understanding of our ancestors.</p>

<p>The skeleton was initially called A.L-288-1, in reference to Afar and its geolocation.</p>

<p>But the researchers nicknamed it Lucy after The Beatles' song "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds", which they listened to after celebrating their discovery.</p>

<p>Lucy walked on two legs and is thought to have died aged between 11 and 13 -- considered an adult for this species. She was 1.10 metres tall (3.6 feet) and weighed 29 kg (64 pounds).</p>

<p>For Sahleselasie Melaku, the 31-year-old head of the palaeontology department, Lucy's discovery represented an emergence from a "dark age" in our understanding of human ancestors.</p>

<p>"The impact of the discovery was very big in the discipline and even the whole world," he told AFP.</p>

<p>Lucy showed that members of the human family existed beyond three million years ago, and she also provided a template for fitting together later bone discoveries.</p>

<p>The amount of information that can be gleaned from the bones has allowed some highly detailed theories about Lucy's life.</p>

<p>A slightly deformed vertebra, for instance, "means she probably had back problems", said Melaku.</p>

<p><strong>'Exceptional'</strong></p>

<p>Jean-Renaud Boisserie, a paleonthologist specialised in Ethiopia and the research director at the French National Centre for Scientific Research said it was an "exceptional" breakthrough for the discipline.</p>

<p>"We basically knew very little about the period of three million years ago, and we had nothing as complete," he said.</p>

<p>Lucy was often described as "the grandmother of humanity", but more recent discoveries suggest she may have been more like an aunt or a cousin, experts say.</p>

<p>Skeletal finds in places like Ethiopia, South Africa and Kenya have complicated the picture and led to much debate about when different species of hominid emerged and which should be classified as part of the human or chimpanzee families.</p>

<p>The discovery of "Toumai" in Chad in 2001 -- a skull dated to six or seven million years old -- suggested the human family may go much further back than previously thought.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Lucy has yet to reveal all her secrets.</p>

<p>A study published in 2016 argued she spent a third of her time in trees, where she nested, and had highly developed upper limbs.</p>

<p>Another study that year in the American journal Plos One theorised that she died after falling from a tree.</p>

<p>A 2022 study in Nature, focused on Lucy's pelvis, concluded that newborn members of Australopithecus had a very immature brain, like human newborns today, and required parental support to survive.</p>

<p>"There are a lot of unanswered questions," said Melaku with a smile. "Especially, we don't know much more about the early livelihoods of these early human ancestors."</p>

<p>The museum receives frequent requests to study it, but the iconic skeleton no longer leaves Ethiopia.</p>

<p>Wider scientific progress and advanced equipment are opening up new avenues for research.</p>

<p>"The studies that can be carried out on her, on her peers, pose the scientific questions of tomorrow," said Boisserie.</p>

<p>"Material as exceptional as this plays a driving role in the evolution of research."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>X boss Elon Musk, who is set to take over as co-chair of the proposed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) in the second Donald Trump administration, has claimed that Amazon head Jeff Bezos had advised people to sell their Tesla and SpaceX stocks because he expected the Republican leader to lose the US election.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Just learned tonight at Mar-a-Lago that Jeff Bezos was telling everyone that <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@realDonaldTrump</a> would lose for sure, so they should sell all their Tesla and SpaceX stock ?</p>
— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1859483544612913376?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 21, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p>"Just learned tonight at Mar-a-Lago that Jeff Bezos was telling everyone that @realDonaldTrump would lose for sure, so they should sell all their Tesla and SpaceX stock," Musk, who is the CEO of both Tesla and SpaceX, wrote in a post on X today.</p>

<p>Bezos, who also owns The Washington Post and aerospace giant Blue Origin, has not responded to the remark yet.</p>

<p>After the US election results showed a triumphant Trump victory, Bezos had put out a post congratulating the 78-year-old leader.&nbsp;"Big congratulations to our 45th and now 47th President on an extraordinary political comeback and decisive victory. No nation has bigger opportunities. Wishing @realDonaldTrump all success in leading and uniting the America we all love," he said in a post on X.</p>

<p>Earlier, the Amazon CEO made headlines after The Washington Post decided to stop making presidential endorsements. The news organisation's move sparked a wave of criticism. In response, Bezos argued that the decision could help improve credibility. He wrote in an op-ed article that presidential endorsements created the "perception of bias" and did not "tip the scales" of an election.</p>

<p>"No undecided voters in Pennsylvania are going to say, 'I'm going with Newspaper A's endorsement'. None," Bezos wrote, defending the move. "What presidential endorsements actually do is create a perception of bias. A perception of non-independence. Ending them is a principled decision, and it's the right one."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[About 72% of decision makers reported that generative AI is used at least once a week, up from 37% in 2023, the first year of the survey.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The use of generative artificial intelligence has quickly become ubiquitous across various types of jobs over the past year, spreading from information technology to areas like human resources, according to a survey of 800 business leaders at <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/how-are-companies-really-using-ai-a-new-report-has-answers/" rel="nofollow,noindex">large corporations</a>.</p>

<p>About 72% of decision makers reported that generative AI is used at least once a week, up from 37% in 2023, the first year of the survey, according to a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/2024-ai-adoption-report/" rel="nofollow,noindex">report</a> by the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania and marketing consulting firm GBK Collective.</p>

<p>Adoption picked up in areas that had a slow start last year, including HR but also marketing and operations. In legal and finance, which were added this year to the survey, weekly usage is almost as prevalent as in IT.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-11/2fk56d8g_artificial-intelligence_625x300_21_November_24.jpg?im=FitAndFill,algorithm=dnn,width=1200,height=738" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>Firms have moved beyond the initial hype and amazement around generative AI toward more practical usage, the report found.</p>

<p>The most-cited uses include document and proposal writing and editing, with 64% of total respondents, followed closely by data analyses and analytics, at 62%. Other functions cited by more than half of the decision makers include customer service and support, fraud detection and prevention, and financial forecasting and planning.</p>

<p>Many questions about generative AI remain unanswered, including how many people might lose their jobs as a result of widespread adoption and how many new jobs will be created.</p>

<p>Almost all respondents working in purchasing and procurement said that generative AI will “enhance” their employees' skills, while almost nine in 10 in finance think it will replace skills, according to the survey,</p>

<p>Overall, the survey shows a small shift in perception compared with last year. A slightly higher percentage of business leaders say generative AI will enhance skills, while a slightly lower share think it will replace skills in some tasks.</p>

<p>The survey shows that the gap is closing between the two extreme beliefs about AI being either a harbinger of doom or a gateway to utopia, said Wharton marketing professor Stefano Puntoni, co-author of the report and faculty co-director of AI at Wharton.</p>

<p>Organizations will keep experimenting with AI to figure out how it works best for them, Puntoni said in a post about the report. “This is only the beginning.”</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Leading the India-Caricom summit as the co-chair, Prime Minister Narendra Modi outlined a seven-pillar programme of action playing on the acronym C-A-R-I-C-O-M.</p>

<p>Having made progress in working towards the goals set at the first summit five years ago, he said the Seven Key Pillars packed into the group's name could transfer resources and expertise from India to the Caribbean, he said on Wednesday as the group's leaders thanked India for its leadership of the Global South and its "selfless" assistance to them.</p>

<p>"C", he said is for Capacity Building. He promised 1,000 information technology scholarships and proposed expanding the technology centre that India is setting up in Belize to accommodate all CARICOM members. He also suggested a forensic centre for the region and civil servants' online training.</p>

<p>"A" is for Agriculture and Food Security. India has benefited from developing technology for agriculture and can help in this area, like deploying drones. Also, he said, it can propagate millets that can help with nutrition.</p>

<p>"R" is for Renewable Energy and Climate Change. He invited the CARICOM countries to join initiatives India has promoted, the International Solar Alliance, the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure, Mission Life for Sustainable Lifestyles, and the Global Biofuel Alliance.</p>

<p>"I" is for Innovation and Technology. India has revolutionised the way technology is used to serve the people and the economy through "Stack" which has created the needed infrastructure. The Universal Payment Interface has revolutionised digital payments and it could be adopted by CARICOM countries. There is also the eMarketplace that helps small and medium enterprises.</p>

<p>"C", the other "C" is for Cricket and Culture. PM Modi said cricket can be a vehicle for women's empowerment and India would give 11 scholarships to each of the CARICOM nations to coach women in cricket. He also proposed cultural exchanges and Festivals of India in the group's countries. With the popularity of Bollywood, India can also organise film festivals.</p>

<p>"O" is for Ocean Economy and Maritime Security. India did not consider Caribbean countries as small island countries but as large ocean countries. This gives them great potential resources that India can help them develop. India can also help build connectivity for the region through cargo ships and ferries. Another area of cooperation is security where CARICOM nations have a blueprint for fighting piracy, drug trafficking and human smuggling.</p>

<p>"M" is for Medicines and Healthcare. India places a high priority on health in the CARICOM countries. India has developed affordable medicines and healthcare through its Janaushadi scheme. India can help develop similar centres in the CARICOM. Technology developed by India for health like telehealth programmes and machines used in cancer treatment are available. Adoption of the Indian Pharmacopeia by all the CARICOM countries could help make available less costly Indian medicines.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Four foreign tourists have died after a suspected mass methanol poisoning from drinking tainted alcohol at a backpacker hotspot in Laos, Western government officials and media said Thursday.</p>

<p>A young Australian woman was the latest confirmed death, and her friend was fighting for her life, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said.</p>

<p>Two Danish citizens and an American had also died, officials said, after what media said was a night out in Vang Vieng where they drank possibly tainted alcohol.</p>

<p>The group of about a dozen tourists became ill after going out on November 12, according to British and Australian media.</p>

<p>"Tragically, Bianca Jones has lost her life. Our first thoughts at this moment are with her family and friends who are grieving a terrible and cruel loss," Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese told parliament.</p>

<p>"We also take this moment to say that we are thinking of Bianca's friend Holly Bowles who is fighting for her life," he said, without giving further details.</p>

<p>Holly was on "life support" in a hospital in Bangkok, her father Shaun Bowles told Australia's Nine News on Wednesday.</p>

<p>At the Bangkok hospital where Bowles was reportedly receiving treatment, staff said they could not confirm whether she was receiving treatment there.</p>

<p>Denmark's foreign ministry said in a statement Wednesday that two Danish citizens had died in Laos, without providing further information.</p>

<p><strong>'Unimaginable time'</strong></p>

<p>The US State Department also confirmed the "death of a U.S. citizen in Vang Vieng, Laos," and said it was "closely monitoring the situation and providing consular assistance."</p>

<p>It did not give details on the date or cause of death.</p>

<p>New Zealand's embassy in Bangkok said it had been contacted by one of its citizens "who was unwell and may be a victim of methanol poisoning in Laos".</p>

<p>The young Australian's family said in a statement to Australia's Herald Sun newspaper that they "are comforted by the knowledge that her incredible spirit touched so many lives during her time with us,"</p>

<p>"The kindness shown to our family during this unimaginable time has been truly humbling."</p>

<p>Vang Vieng has been a fixture on the Southeast Asia backpacker trail since Laos' secretive communist rulers opened the country to tourism decades ago.</p>

<p>The town was once notorious for backpackers behaving badly at jungle parties and has since re-branded as an eco-tourism destination.</p>

<p>On their travel advice websites for Laos, UK and Australia authorities warn their citizens to beware of methanol poisoning while consuming alcohol in Laos.</p>

<p>Methanol can be added to liquor to increase its potency, but can cause blindness, liver damage and death.</p>

<p>In neighbouring Thailand at least six people died and more than 20 were hospitalised after drinking methanol-laced bootleg alcohol in August.</p>

<p><strong>Backpacker hostel</strong></p>

<p>Bowles and Jones, both aged 19 from Melbourne, became unwell while staying at the Nana Backpackers Hostel in Vang Vieng last week, Australian media reported.</p>

<p>The women drank at the hostel's bar before they went out for the evening, the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper reported.</p>

<p>They failed to check out on November 13, when hostel staff rushed the pair to the hospital.</p>

<p>The Facebook and Instagram pages of the hostel had been deactivated as of Thursday and it was no longer taking bookings on booking websites.</p>

<p>AFP was unable to reach the hostel for comment.</p>

<p>UK media reported one British woman was also in hospital in Bangkok after drinking in Vang Vieng.</p>

<p>AFP has contacted the UK's embassies in Thailand and Laos for comment.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you've ever binge-watched an entire season of a K-drama like "Squid Game" or "Crash Landing On You", one Korean-American expert has good news: it's likely improved your mental health.</p>

<p>High production values, top-notch acting and attractive stars have helped propel South Korean TV shows to the top of global viewership charts, but therapist Jeanie Chang, says there are deeper reasons so many people are hooked.</p>

<p>With soap-like plotlines that tackle everything from earth-shattering grief to the joy of new love, watching K-dramas can help people reconnect with their own emotions or process trauma, she says, giving the shows a healing power that transcends their cultural context.</p>

<p>"We all have family pressures and expectations, conflict, trauma, hope," she said, adding that watching heavy topics being successfully managed on screen can change people's ability to navigate real-world challenges.</p>

<p>For Chang, who was born in Seoul but raised in the United States, K-drama was particularly helpful in allowing her to reconnect with her roots -- which she rejected as a child desperate to assimilate.</p>

<p>But "the messages in Korean dramas are universal," Chang said.</p>

<p>"Mental health is how you're feeling, how you relate to others, psychologically, how your brain has been impacted by things. That's mental health. We see that in a Korean drama."</p>

<p><strong>'Soften my heart'</strong></p>

<p>Global K-drama viewership has exploded in the last few years, industry data shows, with many overseas viewers, especially in major markets like the United States, turning to Korean content during the pandemic.</p>

<p>Between 2019 and 2022, viewership of Korean television and movies increased six-fold on Netflix, its data showed, and Korean series are now the most watched non-English content on the platform.</p>

<p>American schoolteacher Jeanie Barry discovered K-drama via a family funeral, when a friend recommended a series -- 2020's "It's Okay to Not Be Okay" -- she thought could help her after a difficult time.</p>

<p>"There was something about it, the way that this culture deal with trauma, mental depression, just really struck a chord for me," Barry, who had travelled to South Korea as part of a K-drama tour organised by therapist Chang, told AFP.</p>

<p>"I started to grieve when I had not been. It was a lot of tears during that drama, but it also made me see that there is a light at the end of the tunnel," she said.</p>

<p>Immediately hooked, Barry said she had watched 114 K-dramas since discovering the genre, and effectively given up watching English-language television.</p>

<p>"They let me soften my heart," she said.</p>

<p>Fellow tour member and American Erin McCoy said she had struggled with depression since she was a teenager, but K-drama helped her manage her symptoms.</p>

<p>With depression, "when you live with it that long, you're just numb and so you don't really feel bad necessarily but you don't ever feel good either," she said.</p>

<p>"You just don't feel anything," she said, adding that K-drama allowed her to experience emotions again.</p>

<p>"There're so many highs and lows in every one of them, and as I felt the characters' emotions, it just helped me relate to my own more," she said.</p>

<p>"I feel like I was able to express and experience emotion again."</p>

<p><strong>'Art therapy'?</strong></p>

<p>The idea that a K-drama binge can help with mental health may seem far-fetched, but it chimes with decades-old psychotherapy ideas, one expert said.</p>

<p>"Watching Korean dramas can be beneficial for anxiety and depression from the viewpoint of art therapy," Im Su-geun, head of a psychiatry clinic in Seoul, told AFP.</p>

<p>First used in the 1940s, art therapy initially involved patients drawing, but evolved to incorporate other artistic activities.</p>

<p>"Visual media like Korean dramas have significant strengths that align well with psychotherapy," he said.</p>

<p>K-drama -- or television and cinema generally -- can help viewers "gain insights into situations from a new perspective, fostering healthy values and providing solutions to their issues," he said.</p>

<p>It is unlikely to be prescribed by a doctor, he said, but if a therapist were to recommend a specific drama that related to the patient's case, it could be helpful.</p>

<p>For example, it can provide a roadmap for patients "facing specific situations, such as breakups or loss," he said.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Britain's former deputy prime minister John Prescott, who served under Tony Blair and helped transform the country's Labour Party, has died aged 86, his family said on Thursday.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Britain's former deputy prime minister John Prescott, who served under Tony Blair and with him helped transform the country's Labour party, has died aged 86, his family said on Thursday.</p>

<p>"We are deeply saddened to inform you that our beloved husband, father and grandfather, John Prescott, passed away yesterday (Wednesday) at the age of 86," a statement read.</p>

<p>Blair, the privately educated lawyer who appointed working-class Prescott to help appease the Labour left as he moved the party to the centre ground, said he was "devastated" at Prescott's death.</p>

<p>"There was no one quite like him in British politics," he told BBC radio.</p>

<p>Keir Starmer, who became Labour's first prime minister since 2010 after a landslide general election win in July, called Prescott "a true giant of the Labour movement".</p>

<p>"He was a staunch defender of working people and a proud trade unionist. During a decade as deputy prime minister, he was one of the key architects of a Labour government that transformed the lives of millions of people across the nation," he added.</p>

<p>"So much of John's work set the path for those of us fortunate enough to follow. From leading climate negotiations to fighting regional inequality, his legacy will live on well beyond his lifetime."</p>

<p>Prescott, a former merchant seaman and trade union activist who served as a member of parliament for Hull in northern England for four decades, died "peacefully" at a care home, his wife Pauline, and two sons said.</p>

<p>"He did so surrounded by the love of his family and the jazz music of Marian Montgomery," they added.</p>

<p>Prescott, who was appointed to the House of Lords, suffered a stroke in 2019 and had been suffering from Alzheimer's. He stopped being a member of the upper chamber of parliament in July because of his health problems.</p>

<p>Plain-speaking, Prescott served for 10 years as Blair's deputy following Labour's landslide 1997 general election win. During a campaign stop in north Wales he punched a protester who threw an egg at him.</p>

<p>But he also acted as a mediator between Blair and his finance minister Gordon Brown, who also helmed the transformation of Labour in the 1990s and who had designs on power.</p>

<p>Prescott's brief included the environment and transport, as well as leading negotiations for Britain for the international Kyoto Protocol on climate change.</p>

<p>Blair said in a 2007 letter to Prescott that he saw his role as "smoothing out colleagues and sorting out colleagues and trouble-shooting".</p>

<p>"The completely unique Prescott blend of charm and brutality... got you through the decade, kept the government together and above all, gave me a lot of fun. I was lucky to have you as my deputy," he told him.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A new lawsuit accusing Sean ‘Diddy' Combs of drugging and raping a man at a Miami house party has been filed in Manhattan. According to the lawsuit, the victim, identified only as “John Doe,” was drugged at the event and he lost consciousness. When he woke up, he found himself in severe pain and realised he had been assaulted, according to a report in The <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/20/us-news/sean-diddy-combs-allegedly-talked-dirty-as-he-raped-male-victim/" rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">New York Post</a>.</p>

<p>According to the court filing, the alleged attack took place in front of a group of people in a bedroom. The victim says he woke up to find Combs standing naked behind him, continuing the assault. He further alleged that throughout the ordeal, Combs was speaking “dirty” and wearing a “disturbing smile.” Due to the effects of the drugs, the victim was unable to resist or fight back and eventually passed out again.</p>

<p>The lawsuit, according to The New York Post, alleged, “Plaintiff heard Combs ‘talk dirty' to him and the others in the bedroom and Plaintiff recalls Combs telling him ‘[t]his is what you want,' all while wearing a disturbing smile. The drugs prevented Plaintiff from fighting back or otherwise resisting Combs' assault. Plaintiff eventually slipped back into unconsciousness.”</p>

<p>The man also claimed he was left alone in the room the following morning, where a member of Combs' security allegedly handed him his clothes and told him to leave.</p>

<p>This lawsuit is part of a larger legal battle for Combs, who is facing multiple civil lawsuits. One of these, filed by a woman known as “Jane Doe,” alleges that Combs sexually assaulted her in 2001 in a black SUV limousine outside a New York City nightclub. The woman claims she was given a spiked drink before being forced to engage in sexual acts with Combs and his security team.</p>

<p>Combs' legal representatives have denied all accusations, dismissing the lawsuits as “shameless publicity stunts.” They told the New York Post in a statement, “Mr Combs has full confidence in the facts and the integrity of the judicial process,” asserting that “the truth will prevail” in court, and that Combs never sexually assaulted or trafficked anyone.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Adam Bernard, who served as Associate Director of Competitor Intelligence, shared his reaction in a LinkedIn post]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>General Motors (GM) recently laid off approximately 1,000 employees worldwide in a cost-cutting effort to stay competitive in a crowded automotive market. The layoffs, primarily affecting white-collar workers, were announced last Friday, with affected employees receiving early morning email notifications.</p>

<p>Among those impacted was Adam Bernard, a GM veteran with 38 years of service. Mr Bernard, who served as Associate Director of Competitor Intelligence, shared his reaction in a LinkedIn post, expressing surprise at the decision.</p>

<p>"Well, in unexpected news, I was let go from GM at 5.07 am this morning via email, along with (I hear unofficially) about 1,000 people globally. I wonder what I should do next...?" Mr Bernard wrote.</p>

<p>Mr Bernard joined GM in 1986 as an analyst and built a distinguished career spanning nearly four decades. During this time, he earned an MBA from Harvard University and, for the past 17 years, led a team dedicated to analyzing competitors' strategies, playing a pivotal role in GM's competitive intelligence initiatives.</p>

<p>In a subsequent LinkedIn post, Mr Bernard indicated he is exploring new opportunities. "I am considering new roles and would appreciate your support. I hadn't planned on starting a new chapter at this point, but I still love the auto industry and am looking to stay connected," he wrote.</p>

<p><strong>See the post here:</strong></p>

<p><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="263" src="https://www.linkedin.com/embed/feed/update/urn:li:share:7263190210492997632" title="Embedded post" width="504"></iframe></p>

<p>The layoffs and how they were handled have drawn significant criticism on social media, with many users condemning the treatment of long-serving employees like Mr Bernard.</p>

<p>A user commented, "25 years and an email was what they chose to tell you. How are you not angry Adam?"</p>

<p>Another user commented, "A 5 am email is very unprofessional, especially to someone who has given so much to the company for so long. At least when GM Energy sacked half our org, we got a Teams call during work hours."</p>

<p>"I'm saddened to hear the news. Regardless of the fact, don't let this change the perspective of person you are and the legacy you built for yourself. Interning at GM and learning from you was extremely valuable to me, keep being who you are. Although those days at GM may have come to an end, your impact on the people in the company is invaluable and I'm sure it will continue into whatever you choose to do next," the third user commented.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in a statement, General Motors confirmed the layoffs and emphasized its focus on operational efficiency. "We need to optimise for speed and excellence," the company said. "This includes operating with efficiency, ensuring we have the right team structure and focusing on our top priorities."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[OpenAI Chief Executive Officer Sam Altman received a modest $76,001 in compensation last year, up slightly from $73,546 in 2022, a newly released tax filing shows.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>OpenAI Chief Executive Officer Sam Altman received a modest $76,001 in compensation last year, up slightly from $73,546 in 2022, a newly released tax filing shows.</p>

<p>Altman, who is worth at least $2 billion, has previously said he gets paid "whatever the minimum for health insurance is." He has also repeatedly said he does not own equity in OpenAI. However, the San Francisco-based artificial intelligence startup has discussed giving him a stake as part of a possible shift to becoming a for-profit business, Bloomberg reported.</p>

<p>Altman's paycheck was included in a filing that US-based nonprofits are required to submit annually to the Internal Revenue Service. The 2023 disclosure covers a tumultuous period for OpenAI and the nonprofit that oversees it. The year started with the skyrocketing popularity of OpenAI's chatbot ChatGPT and ended with Altman's brief ouster after clashing with the board.</p>

<p>OpenAI's co-founder and former chief scientist Ilya Sutskever, who played a key role in firing Altman and left the company in May, received $322,201 in 2023, making him one of the highest paid officers listed on the form. Emmett Shear, the co-founder of Twitch who served as interim CEO during Altman's ouster, was paid $3,720, according to the filing. Though Shear's tenure appeared to last for about three days, the filing said he was paid from Nov. 19 to Nov. 29, which would be $338.18 per day, including weekends.</p>

<p>The total compensation could be much higher for some executives, however. The tax filing does not include any equity-based compensation that OpenAI's named officers may have received as the company's valuation has soared. It also doesn't disclose any outside investment from venture capitalists into OpenAI's for-profit entities.</p>

<p>There is only limited visibility into OpenAI's financials given the lag in reporting and the number of companies that are related to its business. The nonprofit lists several partnership companies and related entities, including Aestas LLC, which oversees employee and investor equity.</p>

<p>According to the filing, OpenAI's nonprofit received $5 million in public contributions in 2023, but the source of the funding wasn't disclosed. The nonprofit ended 2023 with net assets of more than $21 million - a tiny sum compared to the $6.6 billion the company raised in October to support its efforts to keep building powerful AI products.</p>

<p>Last year, OpenAI expanded its charitable giving beyond universal basic income projects linked to Altman, according to the filing. It funded an ethics and journalism grant at New York University as well as research into AI economic opportunity through Atlanta-based nonprofit Operation Hope.</p>

<p>OpenAI also provided financial support for experiments "in setting up a democratic process for deciding what rules AI systems should follow," the company said. The grants went to US institutions such as Harvard College, the University of Washington and the University of Michigan, along with a recipient in East Asia.</p>

<p>"As part of our charter, we're committed to collaborating globally with research and policy institutions to address AGI's challenges, and increased grants support this mission," an OpenAI spokesperson said in a statement.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here are key facts about John Prescott, Britain's combative former deputy prime minister, who has died after a battle with Alzheimer's disease, his family said on Thursday:</p>

<p>- Prescott, 86, served as deputy prime minister in Tony Blair's Labour government from 1997 to 2007 and received a peerage in 2010.</p>

<p>- Born in Wales to a railway signalman and a domestic helper, he was always fiercely defensive of his working class roots. He went to sea at 17, as a steward on a luxury cruise ship, where he boxed to entertain passengers.</p>

<p>- He entered parliament in 1970 and became deputy leader of Labour in 1994. He was an effective conduit between the figureheads of Blair's revamped "New Labour" and the traditionalists of Labour's grassroots. He also acted as peace broker in the fraught relationship between Blair and his future successor, the then-Chancellor Gordon Brown.</p>

<p>- Prescott was persistently lampooned by the media and opponents for his lack of oratory skills. He mispronounced words or made grammatical mistakes, prompting sketch writers to cruelly suggest his speeches would make as much sense played backwards.</p>

<p>- He aimed a left jab at a man who threw an egg at him during the 2001 election campaign, living up to his image as a bare-knuckle politician of the old school. His nickname in the media was "Two Jags", from having two luxury Jaguar cars.</p>

<p>- In April 2006, Prescott acknowledged a long extra-marital affair with his diary secretary Tracey Temple, 24 years his junior. The affair, which included sex sessions in his office, prompted several women to come forward and accuse him of sexist behaviour towards them. His wife Pauline stood by him.</p>

<p>- That July parliament launched a full investigation into his contacts with American billionaire Philip Anschutz, who hoped to open a huge casino at the Millennium Dome in London. Prescott met him several times and had even stayed at his ranch. Police said subsequently Prescott would not face prosecution.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Boeing's new CEO told workers Wednesday the company has serious culture problems and can't afford another mistake, according to a report.</p>

<p>At an hour-long meeting, Kelly Ortberg, who joined Boeing as CEO in August, urged employees to take accountability when they see problems, the Wall Street Journal reported after reviewing a recording of the gathering.</p>

<p>"Boeing has faced many highs and lows," Ortberg said. "We're at a low here, folks."</p>

<p>"Don't sit at the water cooler and bitch about people," he said. "Let's focus on the task at hand."</p>

<p>Ortberg also recounted a conversation he had with President-elect Donald Trump in which the two discussed potential tariffs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ortberg told workers a trade war with China would weigh heavily on Boeing, the newspaper said.</p>

<p>The meeting came about two and a half weeks after Boeing workers in the Seattle area ratified a new contract, ending a more than seven-week strike that shuttered two assembly plants and idled some 33,000 workers.</p>

<p>The strike had exacerbated Boeing's already precarious outlook after a January incident in which a fuselage panel blew out mid-flight on a 737 MAX plane operated by Alaska Airlines.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ortberg has previously called for a "fundamental culture change" at Boeing, emphasizing that it will take time to turn around a company that has also struggled with space setbacks and money-losing defense contracts.</p>

<p>On October 12, Boeing unveiled plans to reduce its global workforce by 10 percent over the coming months.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Boeing said earlier this week it intends to cut almost 2,200 jobs in the US state of Washington, which is home to many of its oldest factories.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Susan Smith, who has served 30 years of a life sentence for killing her two young sons by rolling her car into a South Carolina lake, was unanimously denied parole despite her plea claiming "God has forgiven" her for the killings.</p>

<p>In an emotional hearing, the seven-member South Carolina Board of Paroles and Pardons on Wednesday decided unanimously that Smith should remain in prison, while she sobbed and begged to let her go, The <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/20/us-news/killer-mom-susan-smith-sobs-begs-to-be-released-from-prison-at-parole-hearing-but-refuses-to-take-responsibility-for-actions/" rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">New York Post</a> reported.</p>

<p>Testifying on her own behalf, Smith apologised for the murders but refused to claim full responsibility for her actions and blamed others for the decision she made.</p>

<p>“I am a Christian and I know that God has forgiven me,” Smith told the board, before begging the panel to “show the same kind of mercy.”</p>

<p>Appearing before the board via Zoom, the 53-year-old said, "I am a Christian and I know that God has forgiven me”.</p>

<p>She later begged the panel to “show the same kind of mercy.”</p>

<p>Wiping her tears, Smith claimed she knew what she did was "horrible," adding that she would "give anything if I could go back and change it”.</p>

<p>"I love Michael and Alex with all my heart," added Smith, who can now apply for parole every two years.</p>

<p>Her former husband, David, also addressed the board and said 30 years was not long enough for the crime Smith committed.</p>

<p>"That's only 15 years per child. Her own children. That's just not enough," he said and urged the board to deny her parole.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I will be here every two years going forward to ensure that their death doesn't go in vain," he added.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/20/us/susan-smith-children-car-death-parole/index.html" rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">CNN</a>, Smith is currently serving a life sentence at the Leath Correctional Institution. She confessed to driving her vehicle into the Union County lake in 1994 while 3-year-old Michael and 14-month-old Alex were still strapped to their seats.</p>

<p>During her time in prison, Smith has faced disciplinary action multiple times. This includes two separate sexual encounters with corrections officers, besides incidents of self-harm and possession of marijuana. Recently, she even gave information about her ex-husband and family to a documentary producer.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An Abu Dhabi-based startup is using artificial intelligence (AI) and data analytics to provide detailed temperature dynamics for urban planners, businesses, and residents. FortyGuard, founded by entrepreneur Jay Sadiq, is addressing the critical lack of granular temperature data in cities. The company's technology processes billions of data points daily, creating models of urban heat patterns to help stakeholders make informed decisions to combat extreme heat.</p>

<p>The urban heat island effect, where cities experience temperatures several degrees higher than surrounding rural areas, results from heat-absorbing materials like concrete and asphalt, vehicle emissions, and reduced wind flow caused by tall buildings. US cities such as Chicago and Los Angeles have taken steps, including adding green rooftops and painting roads with solar-reflective materials, to address the concern. However, Mr Sadiq identified a significant data gap, pinpointing the hottest areas in cities to deploy heat-reducing asphalt.<br />
<br />
"When I started the company, I realised the level of information needed didn't exist," Mr Sadiq told&nbsp;<a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/15/tech/fortyguard-urban-heat-ai-hnk-spc/index.html " rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">CNN</a>. This challenge inspired him to develop a solution that combines elevation, vegetation, water bodies, and atmospheric conditions to deliver a comprehensive view of urban temperature dynamics.</p>

<p>FortyGuard's innovative approach delivers models with 89 per cent accuracy for some US cities, mapping urban heat at a granular 10-square-metre resolution. The company has collaborated with clients such as Masdar City, a sustainable urban project in the UAE, to identify heat hotspots and recommend solutions like planting trees and adding water features.</p>

<p>The startup envisions broader applications for its technology. Sadiq aims to integrate urban heat intelligence into platforms like real estate or map services, enabling homebuyers to identify cooler neighbourhoods or joggers to plan optimal routes. "Our approach goes beyond measuring air temperature at a specific point in time," he says.</p>

<p>Experts like James Voogt, a professor of urban climatology at the University of Western Ontario, recognise the demand for precise urban heat data. "The key element is how such AI is being trained and on what," he said.</p>

<p>Chao Ren, an applied climatology specialist at the University of Hong Kong, stressed the significance of how this data is utilised. "The question is really, who will be the end user of your data, and who will put such urban heat information into their practices?" she said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>South Korean police said on Thursday an investigation confirmed that hackers linked to North Korea's military intelligence agency were responsible for an Ethereum cryptocurrency heist in 2019, worth 58 billion won ($41.5 million) at the time.</p>

<p>More than half of the stolen assets were laundered through three crypto exchanges set up by the hackers themselves at a discount to Bitcoin and the rest were laundered through 51 different exchanges, the National Police Agency said.</p>

<p>The hackers infiltrated a crypto exchange where the Ethereum was being kept and stole 342,000 tokens, now valued at more than 1.4 trillion won ($1 billion), the police said in a statement.</p>

<p>It did not name the exchange but South Korea-based Upbit exchange said at the time it had detected the transfer of 58 billion won of Ethereum to an unidentified wallet.</p>

<p>A National Police Agency official declined to confirm the identity of the hackers, but South Korean media said police had identified them as the Lazarus and Andariel groups linked to the North's Reconnaissance General Bureau affiliated with its military.</p>

<p>The police said its findings were based on an analysis of Internet Protocol addresses used and the subsequent flow of assets. The probe was conducted in cooperation with the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and it was the first time North Korea had been identified as the source of a cyberattack on a crypto exchange in South Korea, police said.</p>

<p>In May, a panel of United Nations sanctions monitors said it suspected North Korea mounted 97 cyberattacks on cryptocurrency companies between 2017 and 2024 valued at about $3.6 billion.</p>

<p>Investigators traced 4.8 Bitcoin to a Swiss crypto exchange and recovered them in October and returned them to the Seoul-based exchange, today valued at about 600 million won, police said.</p>

<p>North Korea routinely denies involvement in cyber hacking or crypto heists.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US government late Wednesday asked a judge to order the dismantling of Google by selling its widely used Chrome browser in a major antitrust crackdown on the internet giant.</p>

<p>In a court filing, the US Department of Justice urged a shake-up of Google's business that includes banning deals for Google to be the default search engine on smartphones and preventing it from exploiting its Android mobile operating system.</p>

<p>Antitrust officials said in the filing that Google should also be made to sell Android if proposed remedies don't prevent the tech company from using its control of the mobile operating system to its advantage.</p>

<p>Calling for the breakup of Google marks a profound change by the US government's regulators, which have largely left tech giants alone since failing to break up Microsoft two decades ago.</p>

<p>Google is expected to make its recommendations in a filing next month and both sides will make their case at a hearing in April before US District Court Judge Amit Mehta.</p>

<p>Regardless of Judge Mehta's eventual decision, Google is expected to appeal the ruling, prolonging the process for years and potentially leaving the final say to the US Supreme Court.</p>

<p>The case could also be upended by the arrival of President-elect Donald Trump to the White House in January.</p>

<p>His administration will likely replace the current team in charge of the DOJ's antitrust division.</p>

<p>The newcomers could choose to carry on with the case, ask for a settlement with Google, or abandon the case altogether.</p>

<p>Trump has blown hot and cold in how to handle Google and the dominance of big tech companies.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He has accused the search engine of bias against conservative content, but has also signaled that a forced break up of the company would be too large a demand by the US government.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Too Extreme?</strong></p>

<p>Determining how to address Google's wrongs is the next stage of the landmark antitrust trial that saw the company in August ruled a monopoly by Judge Mehta.</p>

<p>Google has dismissed the idea of a breakup as "radical."</p>

<p>Adam Kovacevich, chief executive of industry trade group Chamber of Progress, said the government's demands were "fantastical" and defied legal standards, instead calling for narrowly tailored remedies.</p>

<p>The trial, which concluded last year, scrutinized Google's confidential agreements with smartphone manufacturers, including Apple.&nbsp;</p>

<p>These deals involve substantial payments to secure Google's search engine as the default option on browsers, iPhones and other devices.</p>

<p>The judge determined that this arrangement provided Google with unparalleled access to user data, enabling it to develop its search engine into a globally dominant platform.&nbsp;</p>

<p>From this position, Google expanded its tech and data-gathering empire to include the Chrome browser, Maps and the Android smartphone operating system.</p>

<p>According to the judgment, Google controlled 90 percent of the US online search market in 2020, with an even higher share, 95 percent, on mobile devices.</p>

<p>The US government currently has five cases pending against big tech over antitrust concerns after the Biden administration adopted a tough stance on reining in the dominance of the companies.</p>

<p>If carried through by the Trump administration, the cases against Amazon, Meta, and Apple, as well as two against Google, could take years to litigate.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US police on Wednesday arrested a homeless man suspected of plotting to bomb the New York Stock Exchange this week after he shared his plans with undercover officers, according to a court filing.</p>

<p>The suspect, identified as Harun Abdul-Malik Yener, was arrested after a months-long investigation by agents with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), who were allegedly asked by Yener to help find explosive components to build a pipe bomb.</p>

<p>Yener, a Florida native born in the United States in 1994, thought the undercover agents were members of a militia he had sought to join.</p>

<p>His motive for the bombing was to create a "reboot" of the US government, according to the FBI.</p>

<p>He told the undercover agents he chose the Stock Exchange building in New York because "tons of people would support it."</p>

<p>"I've already seen it, I know the layout of it, there is barely any security," he later told police.</p>

<p>A search of a storage unit owned by Yener turned up bombmaking sketches, timers, circuit boards and other electronics "that could be used for constructing explosive devices," the FBI said.</p>

<p>Search warrants yielded internet browsing history for Yener involving "aspects of bombmaking" as early as 2017, and a search of his messages and emails revealed additional exchanges on the topic.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The US decision to send anti-personnel landmines to Ukraine -- a major policy shift slammed by rights groups -- was triggered by a change in Russian battlefield tactics favoring infantry over mechanized units.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US decision to send anti-personnel landmines to Ukraine -- a major policy shift slammed by rights groups -- was triggered by a change in Russian battlefield tactics favoring infantry over mechanized units, US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Wednesday.</p>

<p>"They don't lead with their mechanized forces anymore," Austin told reporters while on a visit to Laos. "They lead with dismounted forces who are able to close and do things to kind of pave the way for mechanized forces."</p>

<p>The Ukrainians "have a need for things that can help slow down that effort on the part of the Russians."</p>

<p>President Joe Biden's reversal of his previous curbs on US landmines comes just days after Washington gave Ukraine the green light to use US-made long-range missiles on targets within Russia, a longstanding ask from Kyiv.</p>

<p>The outgoing US administration is aiming to give Ukraine an upper hand before President-elect Donald Trump enters office.</p>

<p>Trump has repeatedly criticized US assistance for Ukraine, claiming he could secure a ceasefire within hours, without explaining details.</p>

<p>His comments have triggered fears in Kyiv and Europe about Ukraine's ability to withstand Russian attacks without US support.<br />
In 2022, Biden said the United States would mostly ban its use of landmines, at the time specifically drawing a contrast with Russia's use of the weapons in Ukraine.</p>

<p>Both Russia and the United States -- neither of which are signatories to the UN Mine Ban Treaty -- have been criticized for their past use of anti-personnel mines.</p>

<p>Ukraine is a signatory of the treaty. A report from the International Campaign to Ban Landmines on Wednesday said Kyiv was investigating the reported use of anti-personnel mines by its soldiers in 2022, in violation of the treaty.</p>

<h2><strong>'Threat to civilians'</strong></h2>

<p>The United States said Ukraine would be supplied with so-called "non-persistent" mines that can self-destruct or render themselves inactive after losing battery charge -- in theory limiting the risk to civilians.</p>

<p>"Within two weeks, if they have not been detonated, they become inert," State Department spokesman Matthew Miller told reporters.<br />
He said that Ukraine would need to conduct missions to get rid of unexploded ordnance at the end of the conflict regardless of the new weapons authorization.</p>

<p>The decision was immediately slammed by rights groups.</p>

<p>Mary Wareham, a deputy director at Human Rights Watch, said Ukraine's use of the mines would contravene the Mine Ban Treaty, and questioned the safety of the aging stocks Washington would be supplying.</p>

<p>"From a clearance perspective, de-miners have to approach any type of explosive object with the knowledge that it may explode," Wareham told AFP, adding that the self-deactivation feature is "not enough."</p>

<p>Amnesty International called Washington's decision "a deeply disappointing setback," saying "even the 'non-persistent' mines are a threat to civilians."</p>

<p>The Biden administration was similarly criticized last year for supplying Ukraine with cluster munitions.</p>

<p><br />
The landmines will be provided as part of a larger tranche of aid being supplied to Ukraine valued at $275 million, which also includes HIMARS rocket ammunition, TOW missiles and small arms.</p>

<p>Battlefield escalation</p>

<p>Both Moscow and Kyiv are jockeying to secure battlefield advantage before Trump assumes office in January.</p>

<p>This week Kyiv fired long-range, US-supplied ATACMS missiles at Russian territory for the first time.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree lowering the threshold for when Russia could use nuclear weapons.</p>

<p>Laos, where Austin made his comments, is still recovering from heavy US bombing during the Vietnam War.</p>

<p>More than 20,000 people have been killed or injured from unexploded ordnance in the half-century since, according to The Halo Trust, a de-mining group.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

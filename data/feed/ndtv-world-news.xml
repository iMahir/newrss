       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Maye Musk, the mother of billionaire Elon Musk, has sparked controversy after she appeared to encourage voter fraud a month ahead of the US elections. On October 5, she wrote on X, “The Democrats have given us another option. You don't have to register to vote. On Election Day, have 10 fake names, go to 10 polling booths and vote 10 times. That's 100 votes, and it's not illegal. Maybe we should work the system too.”<br />
<br />
However, X's community notes flagged the tweet, saying, “This is, in fact, illegal,” citing the US elections code of conduct. Investigations into voter fraud have also consistently shown it to be exceedingly rare, with no evidence supporting organised fraud by Democrats as Maye Musk suggested.</p>

<p>Experts have weighed in on the legality of her statements. Nate Persily, a Stanford Law School election expert and <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/elon-mukss-mother-maye-appears-encourage-voter-fraud-x-post-rcna174307 ">NBC News</a> contributor, noted that if individuals were to act on her advice, they would likely violate election laws. He pointed out that Title 52 of the US Code prohibits using false information to register to vote, with potential penalties, including fines up to $10,000 or imprisonment for up to five years.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Simply using a fake name also does not suffice for voter registration. Individuals must provide proof of identity, which typically includes a driver's licence number or the last four digits of their Social Security number. Election officials verify this information, and voters without proper documentation could be required to present utility bills or other proof of residency, depending on state regulations.<br />
<br />
Hours after her initial post, Maye Musk posted again, advising users to “ignore her previous post.” “In Butler, Pennsylvania, we just heard that the Republicans will make sure no illegals vote,” she clarified.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In yet another tweet, the 76-year-old said that critics “don't understand sarcasm” and claimed her remarks were a response to California Governor Gavin Newsom's Senate Bill 1174, which prohibits local governments from imposing voter ID requirements in elections.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris revealed in an interview broadcast Monday that she owns a Glock semi-automatic pistol -- and said that "of course" she'd fired it on a shooting range.</p>

<p>Speculation has swirled about the US vice president's weapon of choice ever since she told television star Oprah Winfrey recently that she was a gun owner and that she would shoot anyone who broke into her house.</p>

<p>"I have a Glock, and I've had it for quite some time," Harris said in an interview on the primetime CBS show 60 Minutes when asked what kind of firearm she packed.</p>

<p>"My background is in law enforcement. And -- so there you go," added the former prosecutor and California attorney general.</p>

<p>Interviewer Bill Whitaker then asked if Harris had ever fired the Glock. Harris replied with a laugh: "Of course I have. At a shooting range. Yes, of course, I have."</p>

<p>Austrian manufacturer Glock makes one of America's best-selling handguns. Widely used by police, Glocks have also attained cult status from their appearance in films and hip-hop culture.</p>

<p>Until recently Harris had rarely mentioned her status as a firearms owner, in line with her party's emphasis on curtailing access to guns in a country regularly rocked by armed crime and mass shootings.</p>

<p>But in a tight election with Republican Donald Trump, the 59-year-old Democrat has begun to play up her gun-owning credentials.</p>

<p>Trump has repeatedly claimed that Harris wants to confiscate Americans' guns in violation of the US Constitution's Second Amendment -- including in their only televised debate last month.</p>

<p>Harris fiercely rejected that charge, noting that she and her running mate, Tim Walz, are both gun owners.</p>

<p>"I'm a gun owner," she then told Winfrey in September. "If someone breaks into my house, they're getting shot," she added with a chuckle.</p>

<p>Her Glock revelation in was the most eye-catching in an interview that saw Harris carefully navigate tough questioning on hot-button topics like immigration and the economy.</p>

<p>Trump backed out of a 60 Minutes encounter last week, bucking what the program said was a half-century tradition of both US presidential candidates sitting down with the show before an election.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[Pop sensation Taylor Swift is now the world's richest female musician. As of October 8, 2024, Swift has an estimated net worth of $1.6 billion, surpassing another singing superstar Rihanna, Forbes reported.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pop sensation Taylor Swift is now the world's richest female musician. As of October 8, 2024, Swift has an estimated net worth of $1.6 billion, surpassing another singing superstar Rihanna, Forbes reported. The only musician with a higher net worth is hip-hop icon Jay-Z, valued at $2.5 billion.</p>

<p>What sets Swift apart in her financial journey is the source of her wealth. Unlike many of her peers who rely on lucrative brand partnerships and lifestyle ventures, Swift has primarily built her fortune through her music career. She is the first musician to achieve billionaire status predominantly through her musical achievements, including significant earnings from her record-breaking Eras Tour and the valuation of her extensive music catalogue -- valued at approximately $600 million -- according to Forbes.</p>

<p>Additionally, her income from royalties and touring is nearly $600 million, complemented by around $125 million in real estate assets, the magazine reported. In a bid to reclaim ownership of her earlier work, Swift began re-recording her first six albums in 2021. She will resume her Eras tour on October 18 in Miami.</p>

<p>A Washington Post report noted that many of Swift's contemporaries have accumulated their wealth through external ventures and not just music. For example, despite high demand, Rihanna has not released a studio album since 2016's 'Anti,' but her cosmetics brand, Fenty Beauty, launched in 2017, significantly boosted her fortune. Forbes estimated her net worth at approximately $1.4 billion.</p>

<p>Jay-Z, the first billionaire in hip-hop and the wealthiest musician globally with a net worth of $2.5 billion, also derives much of his wealth from business ventures outside of music, according to The Washington Post report. His last studio album, a collaboration with his wife Beyonc&amp;#233; in 2018 titled 'Everything Is Love,' did not contribute significantly to his current wealth. Jay-Z's riches largely stem from his various business interests, including his champagne brand, Armand de Brignac (often referred to as Ace of Spades), and his cognac brand, D'Uss&amp;#233;, along with investments in companies like Uber, Block (the parent company of CashApp), and the music streaming service Tidal.</p>

<p>Apart from rocking the stage, Swift isn't shy about making her political stance clear to her fans and the American electorate. In September, she endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris and praised her running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, for their commitment to issues such as abortion rights, IVF access and LGBTQ+ rights. "She fights for the rights and causes I believe need a warrior to champion them," Swift wrote about Harris in an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/taylorswift/p/C_wtAOKOW1z/">Instagram post</a>.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two men were sentenced this week for orchestrating a sophisticated scheme, tricking Apple into shipping thousands of iPhones and defrauding the tech giant of $2.5 million. Haotian Sun, 33, a Chinese national living in Baltimore, received a 57-month prison sentence, reported the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-dc/pr/two-maryland-residents-found-guilty-multimillion-dollar-scheme-defraud-apple-inc-out ">US Justice Department</a>. His accomplice Pengfei Xue, also 33, who lived in Germantown, Maryland, was sentenced to 54 months.<br />
<br />
Both men were ordered to pay restitution to Apple, with Sun responsible for over $1 million and Xue required to repay $397,800. The scheme, which ran between 2017 and 2019, involved shipping approximately 6,000 counterfeit iPhones to Apple, falsely claiming they needed repairs. The Justice Department described their operation as “sophisticated,” relying on fake serial numbers and bogus warranty claims.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
According to the affidavit from postal inspector Stephen Cohen, the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-man-sentenced-to-jail-for-trafficking-fake-iphones-ipads-that-cost-apple-6-million-5326846">fraudulent activities </a>came to light after an Apple employee tipped off law enforcement. Investigators managed to intercept packages and confirm that counterfeit phones were being sent from China to various Apple retail locations and licensed service providers.<br />
<br />
Apple's standard one-year warranty for iPhones created a loophole for the scam. Sun and Xue shipped devices that either were out of warranty or contained counterfeit parts, leading Apple to mistakenly accept these fraudulent returns. Cohen said that Apple “wrongly” processed dozens of these bogus phones in single shipments.<br />
<br />
To cover their tracks, the two men used multiple aliases and opened various mailboxes to conceal their identification. Federal agents carefully documented the serial numbers of intercepted packages, allowing the shipments to reach their intended recipients before making arrests. The investigation involved surveillance, with police examining trash outside men's homes and tracking them when they returned intercepted packages to Apple Stores.<br />
<br />
Haotian Sun submitted over 1,000 repair requests using several email accounts, some linked to his real identity.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>YouTuber Jack Doherty crashed his $200,000 McLaren sports car during a livestream this weekend after seemingly looking at his phone while driving in the rain. Mr Doherty, 20, who has nearly 15 million subscribers, is known for his controversial prank videos and displays of wealth. He was streaming the incident on Kick, where his channel was later banned following the crash.</p>

<p>A clip circulating online appeared to show Mr Doherty speeding on a wet highway while glancing at his phone before shouting, "No, no, no!" as he lost control of the car and crashed into a guardrail.</p>

<p>Mr Doherty also shared videos of the aftermath, including one of him calling for help from inside the vehicle. In the clip, he asked a bystander to hold the camera as others pulled him out of the window.</p>

<p></p>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p></p>

<p>Viewers criticized Mr Doherty for seemingly showing more concern for his wrecked McLaren than for his injured cameraman, who remained in the passenger seat clutching his arm and bleeding from the head.</p>

<p>A user wrote, "Your friend's face is gushing blood but you make sure he stays filming from all angles.... nice."</p>

<p>Another user wrote, "I don't know who this idiot is but if you're whining about your car on video for likes while a person in the car is hurt and bleeding you're a garbage person."</p>

<p>"You were looking at your phone while driving, reading your chat. Let's be honest, you weren't concerned about your friend at all. You just kept crying about the car and when your friend asked where he was bleeding from, you repeatedly ignored him and made him keep filming you," the third user wrote.&nbsp;</p>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p></p>

<p>Mr Doherty later posted a video from a hospital room, where his cameraman was getting stitches. Some noted he didn't re-upload the full footage showing his actions leading up to the crash.</p>

<p>A separate clip showed Mr Doherty lamenting his damaged car while handing the camera to his injured cameraman, asking him to continue filming.</p>

<p>This isn't Mr Doherty's first on-camera crash. In March, he flipped his new Can-Am off-road vehicle shortly after getting it, and in November, he crashed a golf cart with his girlfriend inside, flipping it toward her, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/pop-culture-news/influencer-jack-doherty-crashes-200k-mclaren-driving-livestream-rcna174183" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>NBC </em></a>reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mr Doherty had purchased the now-totaled McLaren for over $200,000 last year, just weeks after buying a Lamborghini and a Tesla. In a video posted at the time, he joked that he would "crash this car, mark my words."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="theconversation-article-title">What do you imagine a good night's sleep to be?</p>

<div class="theconversation-article-body">
<p>Often when people come into our sleep clinic seeking treatment, they share ideas about healthy sleep.</p>

<p>Many think when their head hits the pillow, they should fall into a deep and restorative sleep, and emerge after about eight hours feeling refreshed. They're in good company – many Australians hold <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychores.2014.09.011">the same belief</a>.</p>

<p>In reality, healthy sleep is cyclic across the night, as you move in and out of the different stages of sleep, often waking up several times. Some people remember one or more of these awakenings, others do not. Let's consider what a healthy night's sleep looks like.</p>

<p>Adults usually move through five or six sleep cycles in a night, and it is entirely <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychores.2014.09.011">normal</a> to wake up briefly at the end of each one. That means we might be waking up five times during the night. This can increase with older age and still be healthy. If you're not remembering these awakenings that's OK – they can be quite brief.</p>

<h3><strong>What does getting a ‘good' sleep actually mean?</strong></h3>

<p>You'll often hear that adults <a href="https://www.sleephealthfoundation.org.au/sleep-topics/how-much-sleep-do-you-really-need#:%7E:text=Sleep%20requirements%20stabilise%20in%20early,their%20best%20the%20next%20day">need between seven and nine hours</a> of sleep per night. But good sleep is about more than the number of hours – it's also about the quality.</p>

<p>For most people, sleeping well means being able to fall asleep soon after getting into bed (within around 30 minutes), sleeping without waking up for long periods, and waking feeling rested and ready for the day.</p>

<p>You shouldn't be feeling excessively sleepy during the day, especially if you're regularly getting at least seven hours of refreshing sleep a night (this is a rough rule of thumb).</p>

<p>But are you noticing you're feeling physically tired, needing to nap regularly and still not feeling refreshed? It may be worthwhile touching base with your general practitioner, as there a range of <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/screen-time-in-bed-is-worse-than-screen-time-before-bed-study-6488051">possible reasons</a>.</p>

<h3><strong>Common issues</strong></h3>

<p>Sleep disorders are common. Up to <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35478719/">25% of adults</a> have insomnia, a sleep disorder where it may be hard to fall or stay asleep, or you may wake earlier in the morning than you'd like.</p>

<p>Rates of common sleep disorders such as insomnia and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/sleep-apnea/symptoms-causes/syc-20377631">sleep apnoea</a> – where your breathing can partially or completely stop many times during the night – also increase with age, affecting <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32280974/">20% of early adults</a> and 40% of people in <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35082023/">middle age</a>. There are effective treatments, so asking for help is important.</p>

<p>Beyond sleep disorders, our sleep can also be disrupted by chronic health conditions – such as <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0012369218311139">pain</a> – and by <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jsr.13075">certain medications</a>.</p>

<p>There can also be other reasons we're not sleeping well. Some of us are woken by children, pets or traffic noise during the night. These “<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07420528.2021.2003375">forced awakenings</a>” mean we may find it harder to get up in the morning, take longer to leave bed and feel less satisfied with our sleep. For some people, night awakenings may have no clear cause.</p>

<p>A good way to tell if these awakenings are a problem for you is by thinking about how they affect you. When they cause feelings of frustration or worry, or are impacting how we feel and function during the day, it might be a sign to seek some help.</p>

<p>We also may struggle to get up in the morning. This could be for a range of reasons, including not sleeping long enough, going to bed or waking up at irregular times – or even your own <a href="https://www.sleephealthfoundation.org.au/sleep-categories/circadian-rhythm-disorders#:%7E:text=The%20circadian%20rhythms%20throughout%20the,regulation%20of%20our%20sleeping%20patterns">internal clock</a>, which can influence the time your body prefers to sleep.</p>

<p>If you're regularly struggling to get up for work or family needs, it can be an indication you may need to seek help. Some of these factors can be explored with a sleep psychologist if they are causing concern.</p>

<h3><strong>Can my smart watch help?</strong></h3>

<p>It is important to remember that sleep-tracking devices can <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-024-01016-9">vary in accuracy</a> for looking at the different sleep stages. While they can give a rough estimate, they are not a perfect measure.</p>

<p>In-laboratory <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31277862/">polysomnography</a>, or PSG, is the best standard measure to examine your sleep stages. A PSG examines breathing, oxygen saturation, brain waves and heart rate during sleep.</p>

<p>Rather than closely examining nightly data (including sleep stages) from a sleep tracker, it may be more helpful to look at the patterns of your sleep (bed and wake times) over time.</p>

<p><a href="https://jcsm.aasm.org/doi/10.5664/jcsm.8356">Understanding your sleep patterns</a> may help identify and adjust behaviours that negatively impact your sleep, such as your bedtime routine and sleeping environment.</p>

<p>And if you find viewing your sleep data is making you feel worried about your sleep, this may not be useful for you. Most importantly, if you are concerned it is important to discuss it with your GP who can refer you to the appropriate specialist sleep health provider.<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hurricane Milton exploded in strength Monday to become a potentially catastrophic Category 5 storm bound for Florida, threatening the US state with a second ferocious hurricane in as many weeks.</p>

<p>The back-to-back hurricanes have whipped up a US election storm, with Vice President Kamala Harris slamming her White House rival Donald Trump and Florida's Republican governor Ron DeSantis for "political gamesmanship" and for spreading misinformation about the federal response.</p>

<p>Milton, which is forecast to batter Mexico's Yucatan peninsula as it churns eastward, rapidly intensified to the highest category on a scale of five, triggering evacuation orders and warnings of savage conditions on Florida's west coast.</p>

<p>The <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/33-dead-in-us-from-hurricane-helene-officials-6666374">National Hurricane Center (NHC)</a> said the storm's maximum sustained winds were near 180 miles (285 kilometres) per hour, and that air pressure at the centre of the storm was at a "near record low."</p>

<p>Communities hit by Hurricane <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/hurricane-helene-rips-through-florida-town-people-left-to-start-from-scratch-6681187">Helene</a>, which slammed Florida late last month, raced to remove debris that could become dangerous projectiles as Milton barrels in.</p>

<p>"Last time, people's cars were underwater... but the bigger issue this time is going to be the wind," said David Levitsky, a retired homeowner on Treasure Island, in Pinellas County.</p>

<p>Residents on the low-lying island have been piling up debris from Helene's flooding in their front yards for removal.</p>

<p>"All this stuff is just wind fodder that's going to just be blowing down the street and hitting who knows what," the 69-year-old told AFP.</p>

<p>Amid the wreckage, DeSantis, a conservative known to clash with the federal government, found himself under fire after broadcaster NBC reported he was ignoring phone calls from Harris on the Helene recovery.</p>

<p>DeSantis did speak to President Joe Biden about the preparations, the White House said late Monday.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Harris slammed the Republican governor for "playing political games."</p>

<p>"It is about political gamesmanship, instead of doing the job you took an oath to do, which is to put the people first," she told reporters, while also criticizing Trump as "extraordinarily irresponsible."&nbsp;</p>

<p>The former president has tapped into real frustration about the federal response after Helene and fueled it with disinformation, falsely claiming federal disaster money had been misappropriated and spent instead on migrants.</p>

<h3><strong>Worst hit in 100 years&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>As Milton barreled toward Florida, state authorities have issued mandatory evacuation orders for areas including some parts of Tampa, a metropolitan area of more than three million people that could take a direct hit.</p>

<p>"If the storm stays on the current track, it will be the worst storm to impact the Tampa area in over 100 years," the National Weather Service said.</p>

<p>A major storm surge for Florida's west coast is forecast for Tuesday night or early Wednesday, and Tampa could suffer an influx of water between eight and 12 feet (2.4 to 3.6 meters) above ground level.</p>

<p>Rainfall of 10 inches (25 centimetres), with localized spots of up to 15 inches, is expected to cause severe flash flooding.</p>

<p>In the central city of Orlando, under grey skies, hundreds of cars lined up to collect sandbags.</p>

<p>"We might<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/after-helene-florida-orders-evacuations-as-hurricane-milton-strengthens-6736892"> evacuate</a>, me and my pets, we might go to Georgia," Tony Carlson, 32, told AFP. "People think it's going to be pretty bad."</p>

<p>Maria Torres, 29, said her family was not planning to leave but had prepared with a generator, food and water.</p>

<p>In Mexico's Yucatan, workers boarded up glass doors and windows, fishermen hauled boats ashore and schools were suspended.</p>

<p>In the southeastern United States, emergency workers are still struggling to provide relief in the aftermath of Helene, which killed at least 230 people across several states.</p>

<p>Helene hit the Florida coastline on September 26 as a Category 4 hurricane, dumping rain and causing massive flooding in remote inland towns in states further north, including North Carolina and Tennessee.</p>

<p>Deanne Criswell, head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), also dismissed the claims about money being diverted to migrants as false and slammed the misinformation as "dangerous."</p>

<p>She warned Monday that "these storms are bringing more water than they ever have and so while we have the wind risk, the water is what's killing people."</p>

<p>Researchers say climate change likely plays a role in the rapid intensification of hurricanes because there is more energy in warmer oceans for them to feed on.</p>

<p>Helene was the deadliest natural disaster to hit the US mainland since 2005's Hurricane Katrina, with the death toll still rising.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Passengers aboard a flight to Tokyo last week got more inflight entertainment than they bargained for last week when an explicit film featuring sex talk and explicit images was broadcast to every screen.</p>

<p>Technical problems meant individual movie selection was not available on a Qantas flight from Sydney to Haneda, leaving the crew to pick one film to be broadcast to the whole cabin.</p>

<p>Their selection of Dakota Johnson and Sean Penn's racy drama "Daddio" was a surprise to many, and to the airline, which apologised Tuesday.</p>

<p>According to one review, the movie features "references to oral sex, masturbation" as well as a "brief but clear photo of erect penis on phone screen. Photos of a woman's naked breasts. Explicit sex-related dialogue and texting".&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The movie was clearly not suitable to play for the whole flight and we sincerely apologise to customers for this experience," a Qantas spokesperson said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Once the mistake was clear, "all screens were changed to a family-friendly movie for the rest of the flight," Qantas added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We are reviewing how the movie was selected."&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Widespread anger among Arab Americans and Muslims over US support for Israel's wars in Gaza and Lebanon could cost Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, the election, Green Party candidate Jill Stein told Reuters on Sunday.</p>

<p>Polls show Harris and her Republican rival, former President Donald Trump, in a tight race for the Nov. 5 election, with Stein garnering just 1% support nationally, as she did in the 2016 election.</p>

<p>But Stein has seen growing support among Arab Americans and Muslims in battleground states like Michigan, Arizona and Wisconsin where they have large populations that helped propel President Joe Biden to narrow victories in the 2020 election.</p>

<p>Stein has sought the support of those groups, calling for a permanent ceasefire in Gaza and an immediate US arms embargo on Israel. An August poll by the Council on American Islamic Relations showed her taking support away from Harris in those swing states.</p>

<p>"The Democrats have lost the Muslim American and the Arab American vote," Stein told Reuters after a rally attended by about 100 people in the Detroit suburb of Dearborn on Sunday. "They're going to be losing enough swing states that they will not win and they cannot win."</p>

<p>She said Democrats could win back those voters if they enacted an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and Lebanon, and halted arms sales to Israel, but that there was no sign of such action.</p>

<p>The Biden administration, along with several US allies like France, has called for an immediate 21-day ceasefire across the Israel-Lebanon border and has been trying, unsuccessfully, to negotiate a ceasefire in Gaza for months.</p>

<p>Asked about her potential role as a "spoiler," taking votes from Harris and so helping Trump in those states, Stein said another Trump presidency would be "terrible" but so would four more years of Democratic rule, given high rental costs, the wars in Gaza and Lebanon, and attacks on civil liberties.</p>

<p>"This is a very dire situation that will be continued under both Democrats and Republicans. So we say there is no lesser evil in this race," she said.</p>

<p>The Democratic party called Stein "a spoiler candidate" with no path to victory.</p>

<p>"She put Donald Trump in the White House in<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/defying-donald-trump-green-party-pursues-recounts-in-3-us-states-1634416"> 2016 </a>and she's ready to do it<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/wisconsin-narrowly-won-by-donald-trump-agrees-to-recount-us-presidential-votes-1630415"> again</a>. A vote for Stein is a vote for Trump," said Adrienne Watson, senior adviser to the Democratic National Committee.</p>

<p>Harris has sought to ease the concerns of Arab American and Muslim voters, and met with a small group of local leaders in Flint, Michigan, on Friday.</p>

<p>Muslim advocacy group Emgage Action endorsed Harris last month, saying it disagreed with her position on the war in Gaza but that Trump posed a greater danger. A separate group called Arab Americans for Harris-Walz launched last week.</p>

<p>On Monday, a campaign group called "Abandon Harris" said it was endorsing Stein, citing a shared responsibility to stand against oppression "and using all our power to stop genocide - wherever it may arise."</p>

<p>Trump is also trying to woo Arab and Muslim voters and his campaign opened an office on Saturday in Hamtramck, a Detroit suburb whose Yemeni American mayor Amer Ghalib has endorsed him.</p>

<p>"For the Arab American and Muslim leaders in Detroit, the overwhelming choice is between Jill Stein and Donald Trump, and our argument is that there's only one person who's brought permanent peace to the region, and that's Donald Trump," said Richard Grenell, who has held dozens of meetings with these voters in Michigan, Arizona and other critical states.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Democratic White House hopeful Kamala Harris said in an interview broadcast Monday that if elected president she would not meet with Vladimir Putin for peace talks if Ukraine was not also represented.</p>

<p>"Not bilaterally without Ukraine, no. Ukraine must have a say in the future of Ukraine," the US vice president told CBS's "60 Minutes" program when asked if she would meet one-on-one with the Russian leader to negotiate an end to the war.</p>

<p>President Joe Biden's administration has previously rejected any talks with Putin.</p>

<p>Harris also reiterated her criticisms of Republican rival Donald <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/harris-trump-face-off-for-first-time-in-key-us-presidential-debate-6537401">Trump's policies</a> on Ukraine, describing them as a "surrender" to the invasion Moscow launched in February 2022.</p>

<p>Trump has previously been critical of Washington's massive military and financial aid for Ukraine and insisted that he could quickly reach a peace deal with Putin.</p>

<p>"Donald Trump, if he were president, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/putin-should-stop-interfering-in-us-elections-white-house-6499064">Putin</a> would be sitting in Kyiv right now. He talks about, 'Oh, he can end it on day one.' You know what that is? It's about surrender," she said.</p>

<p>Kyiv fears such a deal would involve ceding to Russia the territory in eastern Ukraine that it has captured since the invasion.</p>

<p>Harris meanwhile said she would deal with Ukraine's bid to join the NATO military alliance "if and when it arrives at that point."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Elon Musk is ramping up his public support of Donald Trump, telling Tucker Carlson in a conversation streamed Monday that he is "all in" on the Republican presidential candidate.</p>

<p>After appearing alongside Trump at a weekend rally, the world's richest man used a cosy two-hour chat with Carlson to push right-wing talking points, including what he said was the threat to democracy if Democrat Kamala Harris prevails in November's election.</p>

<p>"My view is that <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/elon-musk-donald-trump-pennsylvania-butler-assassination-site-2024-us-presidential-elections-6726322">if Trump doesn't win</a> this election, it's the last election we're going to have," the Tesla and SpaceX boss told former Fox News host Carlson.</p>

<p>Musk, who has increasingly courted controversy in recent years, said he believed "illegals" -- migrants -- were being deliberately transported to a handful of key states, where if they are eventually granted citizenship, they will become Democrat voters.</p>

<p>"Now these swing-state margins are sometimes ten- twenty-thousand votes. So what happens if you put hundreds of thousands of people into each swing state?</p>

<p>"So my prediction is, if there's another four years of a Dem administration, they will legalize so many illegals that... the next election there won't be any swing states, and this will be a single-party country."</p>

<p>The assertions from <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/donald-trump-to-return-to-shooting-site-in-pennsylvania-elon-musk-to-attend-6712802">Musk</a> -- who is himself from South Africa -- are a common refrain on the political right, which alleges a conspiracy between Democrats and immigrants.</p>

<p>Musk is<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-presidential-elections-2024-elon-musk-changes-x-display-picture-to-show-support-for-donald-trump-6726978"> increasingly becoming</a> a surrogate for Trump on the campaign trail and is reportedly planning to make a number of stops in battleground states in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>Over the weekend, he unveiled a program promising to pay $47 to anyone who registers voters in Pennsylvania, Georgia, North Carolina, Arizona, Michigan, Wisconsin and Michigan.</p>

<p>The scheme is looking to copy successful referral programs the South African-born entrepreneur has used in the past with his Tesla electric cars.</p>

<p>In his nearly two-hour chat with Carlson, in which the two men chuckled repeatedly at each other's pronouncements, Musk said he had thrown his <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/elon-musk-secretly-funded-right-wing-group-long-before-donald-trump-endorsement-sources-6706711">full backing</a> behind fellow billionaire Trump.</p>

<p>"If he loses, it's going to be hard for you to pretend you never supported him," said Carlson.</p>

<p>"I'm like, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/if-elected-to-power-will-appoint-elon-musk-to-lead-us-government-efficiency-panel-donald-trump-6500930">all in</a>, baby," replied Musk.</p>

<p>"How long do you think my prison sentence is gonna be?" he chortled, laughing at the idea that the tables would turn against him under a Democratic administration. "Will I see my children? I don't know."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A US judge on Monday ordered Google to open its Android smartphone operating system to rival app stores, in a fresh legal setback for the tech giant.</p>

<p>The order is the result of Google's defeat in an antitrust case brought by Fortnite-maker Epic Games, where a California jury decided that Google wields illegal monopoly power through its Android Play store.</p>

<p>The San Francisco jury in December took just a few hours to decide against Google, finding that the company had embarked on various illegal strategies to maintain its app store monopoly on Android phones.</p>

<p>The order, which Google is appealing, follows a similar setback in August when a different judge found that Google's world-leading search engine was also an illegal monopoly.</p>

<p>Google is also facing an antitrust lawsuit in a third federal case in Virginia over its dominance of online advertising.</p>

<p>Under the Epic Games order, for the next three years Google will be prohibited from engaging in several practices that were deemed anticompetitive by the jury in the landmark case.</p>

<p>These prohibitions include revenue sharing with potential competitors and requirements that developers launch apps exclusively on the Play Store.</p>

<p>The judge has also ordered the creation of a three-person Technical Committee to oversee the implementation of the changes and resolve any disputes that may arise.</p>

<p>This injunction represents a significant challenge to Google's dominance in the Android app ecosystem and could reshape the mobile app landscape in the coming years.</p>

<p>Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney urged companies to seize this opportunity "to build a vibrant and competitive Android ecosystem with such critical mass that Google can't stop it."</p>

<p>He also underlined that the changes would only be applicable in the US, but pledged that "the legal and regulatory battle will continue around the world."</p>

<p><strong>- Google appeals -</strong></p>

<p>Google said it would appeal the injunction and also demand that it be set aside pending the outcome of its continued legal challenge.</p>

<p>The judge said the order was effective November 1, with some provisions given until July 1 to be implemented.</p>

<p>"We will keep advocating for what is best for developers, device manufacturers and the billions of Android users around the world," said Lee-Anne Mulholland, the company's regulatory affairs vice president.</p>

<p>Phones running on the Android operating system have about a 70 percent share of the world's smartphone market.</p>

<p>Smartphone companies can install the Android app for free under the condition that the Play app store remains on the home page and that other Google offers are pre-installed.</p>

<p>The jury found that Google worked illegally to make sure that the Google Play app store was the only conduit for making payments to third party apps such as Fortnite and other games.</p>

<p>A sizable chunk of app store revenue comes from video games, and Epic Games has long sought to have payments for its mobile games, such as Fortnite, take place outside the Google or Apple app stores that take commissions as high as 30 percent.</p>

<p>Epic mostly lost a similar case against Apple, where a different US judge largely ruled in favor of the iPhone-maker.</p>

<p>Apple and Google regularly argue that their app shop commissions are industry-standard, and that they pay for benefits such as reach, transaction security and ferreting out malware.</p>

<p>Google also argued that the arrangement with smartphone makers helped Android-run devices better compete against Apple's iPhone.</p>

<p>But the trial exposed that Google rakes in tens of billions of dollars of revenue through the app store.</p>

<p>In order to preserve its one-stop-shop for apps, Google paid smartphone makers a cut of its revenue in return for the Play store remaining the exclusive gateway.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, at an official memorial marking the anniversary of October 7 attack Monday, vowed to press on fighting until achieving the "sacred mission" of the war against Hamas.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel on Monday battled on multiple fronts, intensifying its fight with Lebanon's Hezbollah as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to press the "sacred mission" against Israel's enemies, on the first anniversary of the deadliest attack in Israeli history.</p>

<p>Hamas said it will be a long fight, but Netanyahu said both wars would ensure the violence Israel endured last October 7 could never be repeated.</p>

<p>Israel's military said air defences intercepted a missile fired from Yemen, while in the West Bank, Palestinian officials reported a deadly Israeli raid.</p>

<p>Tehran, which arms and finances Hezbollah and backs the Yemeni rebels, hailed Hamas's October 7 attack as Iran awaits what Israel said will be retaliation for an Iranian missile barrage on Israel last week.</p>

<p>"As long as the enemy threatens our existence and the peace of our country, we will continue to fight. As long as our hostages are still in Gaza, we will continue to fight," Netanyahu said in a pre-recorded television address, vowing not to give up on the "sacred mission" of achieving the war's goals.</p>

<p>Pope Francis condemned the "shameful inability" of world powers to end the Middle East conflict, and European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said the region is "on the verge of a complete conflagration".</p>

<p>Abu Obeida, spokesman for Hamas's armed wing, said the movement chooses "to keep up the fight in a long war of attrition, one that is painful and costly for the enemy".</p>

<p>He also said scores of people taken hostage into Gaza last October 7 were enduring a "very difficult" situation.</p>

<p><strong>- Thousands of militants killed -</strong></p>

<p>A senior Hamas official has acknowledged that "several thousand fighters from the movement and other resistance groups died in combat".</p>

<p>When the Gaza war began, Netanyahu vowed to "crush" Hamas, but troops have found themselves returning again to areas to confront signs the movement was trying to rebuild.</p>

<p>Netanyahu has vowed to bring home the hostages, but critics in Israel have accused him of obstructing mediation for a truce and hostage-release deal.</p>

<p>Late last month Israel turned its focus north towards Hezbollah, with intensified air strikes in Lebanon and, since last week, "targeted" ground raids.</p>

<p>Netanyahu says the aim is to ensure tens of thousands of Israelis forced to flee Hezbollah fire can return home safely.</p>

<p>On Monday the military said it would expand its operations against Hezbollah to Lebanon's coast south of the Al-Awali river, and warned people to stay away.</p>

<p>It also declared a "closed military zone" near the coast in Israel's extreme northwest, near Shlomi, after a similar declaration last week to the northeast in the Metula area.</p>

<p>The military said Hezbollah fired about 135 projectiles into Israel Monday and Israeli forces hit back by striking "over 120 terror targets in southern Lebanon within an hour".</p>

<p>Late Monday, Lebanese state media reported more Israeli strikes on Hezbollah's south Beirut stronghold, which has been repeatedly pounded even after a bombing killed Hezbollah's leader Hassan Nasrallah.</p>

<p><strong>- More troops deployed -</strong></p>

<p>Hezbollah said it targeted Israeli soldiers in two south Lebanon border villages, including Maroun al-Ras where it has reported previous clashes. The army said it had deployed another division for operations across the border.</p>

<p>At least four projectiles were fired from Gaza just after October 7 commemorations began, Israel's military said, adding it retaliated against militant infrastructure throughout Gaza.</p>

<p>Hamas said it fired rockets near the border with Gaza and at Tel Aviv, while Hezbollah twice said it had launched rockets at areas north of Haifa, a major coastal city.</p>

<p>As troops fought what Israel says is a war for its very existence, vigils at massacre sites and rallies called for the return of hostages a year after their abduction.</p>

<p>The October 7 attack resulted in the deaths of 1,206 people, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.</p>

<p>Late Monday in Tel Aviv, musicians performed as victims' images flashed on screens at a ceremony attended by families and relatives of those killed and abducted.</p>

<p>"We know in our minds, our hearts, in every cell in our bodies: there will be no rehabilitation without the return of the hostages. All of them," said Nitza Corngold, whose son Tal Shoham was seized.</p>

<p>The day began with President Isaac Herzog leading a moment's silence at 6:29 am -- the time the attack began -- in Reim, a kibbutz community where Hamas fighters killed at least 370 people at the Nova music festival, that day's deadliest attack.</p>

<p>It began when Hamas fired thousands of rockets at nearby Israeli communities.</p>

<p>At the same time militants stormed across Gaza's fortified border and attacked nearly 50 different sites, including kibbutzim communities and army bases.</p>

<p>Militants went door-to-door shooting residents dead.</p>

<p><strong>- Gaza's 'graveyard' -</strong></p>

<p>Hours later, Israel launched a military offensive that has reduced swathes of Gaza to rubble, and displaced nearly all of its 2.4 million residents at least once amid an unrelenting humanitarian crisis.</p>

<p>Philippe Lazzarini, head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, said on X Monday the war had turned Gaza into a "graveyard".</p>

<p>Of the 251 people taken hostage into Gaza, 97 are still being held, including 34 the Israeli military says are dead.</p>

<p>According to Hamas-run Gaza's health ministry, 41,909 people, the majority civilians, have been killed there since the start of the war. The figures have been deemed reliable by the United Nations.</p>

<p>Since Israel's escalation in Lebanon began in late September, more than 1,110 people have been killed and more than one million are displaced, official figures show.</p>

<p>Violence has also soared in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, where the Palestinian health ministry says more than 700 people have been killed since the Hamas attack, including two on Monday during Israeli raids.</p>

<p>Israel's military says 349 soldiers have been killed since the Gaza ground offensive began on October 27.</p>

<p>People in Gaza just want the war to end.</p>

<p>"I have grown old while watching my children hungry, scared, having nightmares and screaming day and night from the sound of the bombing and shells," said one displaced woman, Israa Abu Matar, 26.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The inauguration of a new runaway in the Maldives built under an airport redevelopment project assisted by India and the official launch of the RuPay card in the island nation on Monday are aimed at boosting economic ties and tourism cooperation between the two countries.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Maldivian Mohamed Muizzu jointly virtually inaugurated the runway at the Hanimadhoo International Airport and also witnessed via weblink a live transaction using a RuPay payment service card in the Maldives.</p>

<p>The launch took place after the two leaders held extensive talks which Muizzu in his press statement said were to "chart a new path for the future".</p>

<p>The Maldivian president accompanied by First Lady Madam Sajidha Mohamed and a Maldivian delegation arrived in India on Sunday evening.</p>

<p>Though the Maldivian president attended PM Modi's swearing-in ceremony in June, it is his first bilateral visit to India.</p>

<p>Prior to the launch of different India-assisted projects in the Maldives, a small official video was played in which details about these projects were shared in the presence of the two leaders at the Hyderabad House.</p>

<p>"The bonds between India and Maldives stretch back centuries, woven together through rich trade and cultural exchanges," it was narrated in the video.</p>

<p>Over the years, this relationship has evolved, characterised by "mutual respect and unwavering support", underpinned by India's Neighbourhood First policy and SAGAR vision, it said.</p>

<p>India has always been the first responder in the Maldives during times of crisis.</p>

<p>"Under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Mohamed Muizzu, this relationship is to achieve greater heights," it added.</p>

<p>The RuPay card launch today will pave the way for strengthened India-Maldives relations by boosting tourism and economic cooperation, according to the India-Maldives video.</p>

<p>"It will allow Indian tourists to make cashless transactions easily, reducing cost and enhancing convenience, especially in the Maldives tourism sector," it said.</p>

<p>The inauguration of the new runaway at Hanimadhoo International Airport marks a "significant milestone in the airport's ongoing expansion project".</p>

<p>Its redevelopment, under an "Indian Line of Credit of USD 132 million", aims to provide complete new infrastructure including runaway, ATC tower, ARFF block, hangar, cargo facilities, and passenger terminal building, it added.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Modi in his press statement after the bilateral talks said President Muizzu's visit adds "another chapter to our ties".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pakistan's Punjab government on Monday banned jailed former premier Imran Khan from meeting his family members, lawyers and party leaders till October 18 due to "security concerns", amidst his party staging anti-government protests in several cities.</p>

<p>The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf founder Khan has been lodged in Rawalpindi's Adiala Jail in multiple cases since August 2023.</p>

<p>Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi has accused PTI of trying to disrupt the upcoming Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit scheduled to be held on Oct 15 and 16 in Islamabad and emphasised that the government will ensure that these plans do not succeed.</p>

<p>"Incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi have been banned from meeting their family, lawyers, and party leaders at Adiala Jail, Rawalpindi, till Oct 18," a Punjab government official said.</p>

<p>The government has decided given "security concerns", he said.</p>

<p>According to PTI sources, the government has decided in anticipation of the upcoming SCO summit.</p>

<p>The coalition government led by PML-N's Shehbaz Sharif has alleged that PTI is staging protests in Islamabad to sabotage the summit. The Pakistan Army has been called in to provide security for the SCO summit.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The mayor of the capital of Mexico's violence-plagued state of Guerrero was killed on Sunday less than a week after he took office, the state's governor confirmed.</p>

<p>Alejandro Arcos was killed just six days after he took office as mayor of the city of Chilpancingo, a city of around 280,000 people in southwestern Mexico.</p>

<p>"His loss mourns the entire Guerrero society and fills us with indignation," Guerrero Governor Evelyn Salgado said in a statement shared on social media.</p>

<p>Guerrero's state attorney general's office also said it was investigating his murder.</p>

<p>The official confirmation came after photos circulated on the messaging app WhatsApp depicting a severed head on top of a pick-up truck, appearing to be that of Arcos. Reuters could not independently verify the photos' authenticity.</p>

<p>Arcos' death comes just three days after the new city government's secretary, Francisco Tapia, was shot to death.</p>

<p>"They were young and honest officials who sought progress for their community," Senator Alejandro Moreno wrote on social media.</p>

<p>Moreno, who is the head of Mexico's PRI political party, called on the federal attorney general's office to lead the investigation into Arcos and Tapia's murders, given "the situation of ungovernability in Guerrero."</p>

<p>Guerrero has become one of the deadliest states for aspiring and elected public officials, as well as for journalists.</p>

<p>At least six candidates for public office were killed in the state in the run-up to Mexico's June 2 elections.</p>

<p>Arcos' social media posts show the mayor in recent days had been supervising disaster relief efforts following the impact of Hurricane John last month, which caused severe flooding in beach resort Acapulco and surrounding towns.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

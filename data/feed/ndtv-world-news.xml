<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi's recent visit to the United States, which took place at a time when the world is confronting critical geopolitical, economic, technological, and climate challenges, marked yet another milestone in the relationship between the world's two largest democracies.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At a time of a swift global shift towards plurilateral approaches, the visit sought to put into action the "bold and audacious" commitments that Prime Minister Modi and U.S. President Joe Biden had made to forge one of the most defining and consequential bilateral relationships of this century.</p>

<h2><strong>A Deep Commitment</strong></h2>

<p>While the highlight of the visit was the Sixth QUAD Leaders' Summit hosted by President Biden in his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, bilateral ties received a huge boost from key announcements in areas such as semiconductors, space, advanced telecommunications, artificial intelligence, quantum, biotechnology, and clean energy. These landmark initiatives demonstrate a deep commitment towards realising the ambitious goals of the US-India Comprehensive Global and Strategic Partnership.</p>

<p>The QUAD, a strategic alliance of India, the United States, Australia, and Japan with a commitment towards maintaining a free and an open Indo-Pacific, has evolved into a critical force in implementing tangible initiatives across the Pacific, Southeast Asia, and the Indian Ocean Region. The summit cemented cooperation across various sectors, including maritime security, health, cyber capabilities, climate security, semiconductor supply chains, and disaster preparedness. The launch of the QUAD Investors Network, designed to accelerate investments in critical and emerging technologies, coupled with the inaugural meeting of the QUAD Commerce and Industry ministers in coming months, underscores the vital role businesses are set to play within the Quad.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Chipping In</strong></h2>

<p>Most notable, however, is the establishment of the first India-US semiconductor fabrication unit, focusing on advanced sensing, communication, and power electronics. Hailed as the first-ever national security semiconductor fabrication plant, it will produce chips for military applications, not only bolstering the supply chain ecosystem but also further cementing vital India-US defence ties.</p>

<p>The success and expansion of the US-India Defense Industrial Cooperation Roadmap through India's planned procurement of 31 MQ-9B remotely piloted aircraft, enhancing intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities, is another key result of Prime Minister Modi's visit. This, along with the establishment of a Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul facility for C-130J Super Hercules aircraft, and initiatives like the India-U.S. Defense Acceleration Ecosystem (INDUS-X) underscores the deepening defence partnership between the two nations, essential for addressing current and future global security challenges.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Initiative on Critical and Emerging Technologies (iCET), launched in 2023 by the two countries, acts as a crucial platform guiding responsible technological development globally and secures our countries' technology supply chains. The recent meeting expanded this strategic cooperation through tangible actions, such as the mobilisation of millions of dollars in funds to support high-impact R&amp;D partnerships between US and Indian universities and research institutions in the areas of semiconductors, next-generation communication systems, biotechnology, sustainability, connected vehicles, and green technologies and intelligent transportation systems and initiatives around advanced materials, quantum, and artificial intelligence.</p>

<h2><strong>On Clean Energy</strong></h2>

<p>The newly unveiled US-India Roadmap to Build Safe and Secure Global Clean Energy Supply Chains, with a commitment to unlock over $1 billion in multilateral financing, represents another historic opportunity for both nations to lead in renewable energy transition, energy storage, and zero-emission vehicles, while collaborations under the Strategic Clean Energy Partnership to accelerate the development of supply chains for critical minerals reflects a concerted effort towards operationalising this energy partnership.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Industry across both countries has been playing a crucial role in operationalising these initiatives. While Indian companies are seeking access to investments and technologies, American companies already employing millions of Indians are keen to further dip into the vast Indian talent pool and the world's biggest market. Prime Minister Modi emphasised the enormous potential of technological collaboration in his meeting with some of America's top CEOs. This mutual growth can revolutionise the global technology landscape while driving shared India-US prosperity.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Finally, deepening relations with the United States can be central to Prime Minister Modi's vision to make India a developed nation by 2047. A bipartisan understanding of India's importance in the world makes the U.S. an important stakeholder and player in India's growth story. His latest visit not only strengthened the Quad, but also highlighted the alignment between the two nations even as it built new avenues and mechanisms of collaboration among all stakeholders. As India's largest trading partner, the United States will be instrumental in providing the capital, expertise, and market access required for India to climb the global economic ladder.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[He lifted Chen off the floor and fled the courtroom with her on his back, leaving his wife screaming.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A dramatic scene unfolded in a Chinese courtroom when a man, Li, forcibly carried his wife, Chen, out to avoid getting divorced. According to the <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scmp.com/news/people-culture/trending-china/article/3280304/china-husband-accused-abuse-flees-courtroom-wife-his-back-refusing-divorce">South China Morning Post</a></em>, Chen had filed for divorce, citing domestic violence and alleging Li's aggression when intoxicated. The couple, married for 20 years with two sons and a daughter, resides in Sichuan province. Despite Chen's claims, the court initially denied the divorce, suggesting reconciliation was possible due to their "deep emotional bond" and Li's reluctance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, Chen appealed, leading to a second trial where Li's emotions got the better of him. He lifted Chen off the floor and fled the courtroom with her on his back, leaving his wife screaming. Court bailiffs swiftly intervened, reprimanding Li. Later, on September 12, Li apologized in writing, acknowledging his excesses and vowing not to repeat them.&nbsp;</p>

<p data-qa="Component-Component" datatype="p">''In my emotional agitation, I mistakenly thought I was about to divorce the appellant, so I carried her out of the courtroom, ignoring the instructions of the judges and court officers who tried to stop my extreme actions. I now realise the seriousness of my mistake and its negative impact. I guarantee that I will never repeat this mistake in the future,'' he wrote.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, the couple decided not to proceed with their divorce. Despite Chen's initial allegations of domestic violence and her appeal to end their 20-year marriage, she chose to give Li another chance.</p>

<p>The court's decision has sparked widespread concern and dissatisfaction online, with many people questioning the court's understanding of domestic violence and the legal system's handling of such cases. This isn't an isolated incident, as domestic violence remains a pervasive issue in China.&nbsp;According to the All-China Women's Federation, 30 per cent of married women reported to have experienced domestic violence and 60% of female suicides are attributed to this very issue.&nbsp;</p>

<p>One user said, ''If he can carry her out of the courtroom in public, what might he do in private.''</p>

<p>Another commented, ''What does it mean that the relationship has not broken down? Does it only count if someone was beaten to death?''</p>

<p>A third added, ''Oh my God! How could they not grant a divorce in this situation?''</p>

<p></p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What kinds of weapons Iran used to strike Israel on Tuesday night? Iran has an arsenal of ballistic and cruise missiles and drones, which have been used in the recent past to target Israel. It is believed nearly 200 ballistic missiles were fired by Iran on Tuesday night.</p>

<p>Let's focus on that for a moment. Now, Iran operates for starters a 300-km range missile called the Shahab-1. That's a relatively short-range missile which cannot hit Israel. It can only strike targets in a region well away from Israel.</p>

<p>Another missile is the Fateh missile which flies between 300 and 500 km. Again, that missile doesn't have the range to hit Israel.</p>

<p>The other missile is the Shahab 2, which has got longer legs - 500 km, but still out of range to hit targets in Israel.</p>

<p>The Zolfaghar missile can just about touch Israel. It has got a range of 700 km, so parts of Israel can just about be targeted by this missile.</p>

<p><strong>VIDEO</strong> | <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/iran-israel-missile-attack-iron-dome-video-israel-shoots-down-irans-onslaught-but-some-missiles-sneak-past-6699211">Iran Launching Hundreds Of Ballistic Missiles At Israel</a></p>

<p>There is a missile called Qiam-1 with a range of 750 km, or 50 km more than the Shahab-2. It is a relatively more advanced missile and can target a few more areas, but not deep inside Israel.</p>

<p>But there is the Shahab-3 with a range of 2,000 km which can quite easily strike all of Israel. In fact, it can strike many areas in the region. So that's the missile, variants of which may have been actually used in Tuesday's attacks.</p>

<p>But Israel has the world's most sophisticated ballistic missile defence systems. It's a tiered defence system, which was clearly breached last night. Videos show Iranian missiles hit Tel Aviv. Iran also released videos of the ballistic missiles being launched from its territory.</p>

<p>What we don't know is how many of these missiles hit their targets and whether some of the impacts were fragments of missiles coming down after they were intercepted by the Israeli missile shield. While we do talk about Israeli surface-to-air missiles (SAMs) being fired in defence, we really need to take a look at the distance that these interceptor SAMs travelled and the altitude they reached to take out Iranian ballistic missiles.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-10/vttv2vko_israel-air-defence-system_625x300_02_October_24.jpeg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p><strong>READ</strong> |&nbsp;<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/captain-aged-22-israel-says-1st-soldier-killed-in-lebanon-combat-ops-6700889">"Captain, Aged 22...": Israel Says 1st Soldier Killed In Lebanon Combat Ops</a></p>

<p>For starters, let's talk a little bit about Israel's Arrow system. It is a part of a system, so the word missile and system are used interchangeably. Now, when one talks about SAM systems, you have to talk about the range and the altitude it can reach.</p>

<p>Israel's Arrow system can intercept incoming ballistic missiles in the exosphere, just outside the atmosphere. It has a range of 2,000 to 2,400 km. It can fly to an altitude of a whopping 100 km; perhaps it's the most advanced system of its class in the world.</p>

<p>There were other systems presumably used to intercept Iranian missiles last night. Let's look at the next one, which is David's Sling system. It can fly to a range of 300 km and an altitude of about 15-odd km in making interceptions.</p>

<p>And finally, what we all talk about is the Iron Dome. It's a relatively short range missile system. In fact, when one speaks about what Israel has, people say it's the Iron Dome in action. But the Iron Dome is a part of the entire missile defence tier and the last line of defence. It can fly to an altitude of 10 km and has a range of about 70 km. It's not optimally suited to take out ballistic missiles. It is better equipped to take on short-range rockets of the type Hamas and Hezbollah have been firing.</p>

<p>Obviously, there have been breaches of the system as well. But many lives have not been lost and the damage primarily is believed to be at Israeli military bases.</p>

<p>The big question is will there be an Israeli response, and when would it happen?</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Israel and Hamas have been waging war since gunmen from the Palestinian militant group in the Gaza Strip stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, killing 1,200 people and capturing 253 hostages, by Israeli tallies.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel and Hamas have been waging war since gunmen from the Palestinian militant group in the Gaza Strip stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, killing 1,200 people and capturing 253 hostages, by Israeli tallies.</p>

<p>Israel responded with a military offensive in Gaza in which more than 41,500 Palestinians have been killed, according to Gaza health authorities. Nearly the entire population of 2.3 million people in the enclave have been displaced from their homes and much of the territory has been laid to waste.</p>

<p>The Gaza war is the bloodiest episode yet in a protracted conflict between Israelis and Palestinians that has rumbled for seven decades and destabilised the Middle East.</p>

<p>Recent weeks have also seen a dramatic escalation in a related conflict across Israel's border with Lebanon, where the Iran-backed armed movement Hezbollah says it is fighting in solidarity with the Palestinians.</p>

<h3><strong>WHAT ARE THE ORIGINS OF THE ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN CONFLICT?</strong></h3>

<p>The conflict pits Israeli demands for a secure homeland in what it has long regarded as a hostile Middle East against Palestinians' unrealised aspirations for a state of their own.</p>

<p>In 1947, while Palestine was under British mandate rule, the United Nations General Assembly agreed a plan to partition it into Arab and Jewish states and for international rule over Jerusalem. Jewish leaders accepted the plan, which gave them 56% of the land. The Arab League rejected the proposal.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-10/5ikicev_israel-palestine-map-getty_625x300_02_October_24.jpeg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>Israel's founding father, David Ben-Gurion, proclaimed the modern state of Israel on May 14, 1948, a day before the scheduled end of British rule, establishing a safe haven for Jews fleeing persecution and seeking a national home on land to which they cite ties dating to antiquity.</p>

<p>In the late 1940s, violence had been intensifying between Arabs, who comprised about two-thirds of the population, and Jews. A day after Israel was created, troops from five Arab states attacked.</p>

<p>In the war that followed, some 700,000 Palestinians fled or were driven from their homes, ending up in Jordan, Lebanon and Syria, and in Gaza, the West Bank and East Jerusalem. Palestinians lament this as the "Nakba", or catastrophe. Israel contests the assertion that it forced out Palestinians.</p>

<p>Armistice agreements halted the fighting in 1949 but there was no formal peace. Descendants of Palestinians who stayed put in the war make up about 20% of Israel's population now.</p>

<h3><strong>WHAT WARS HAVE BEEN FOUGHT SINCE THEN?</strong></h3>

<p>In 1967, Israel made a pre-emptive strike on Egypt and Syria, launching the Six-Day War. Israel captured the West Bank and Arab East Jerusalem from Jordan, the Golan Heights from Syria and the Sinai Peninsula and Gaza Strip from Egypt.</p>

<p>A 1967 Israeli census put Gaza's population at 394,000, at least 60% of them Palestinian refugees and their descendants.</p>

<p>In 1973, Egypt and Syria attacked Israeli positions along the Suez Canal and Golan Heights, starting the Yom Kippur War. Israel pushed both armies back within three weeks.</p>

<p>Israel invaded Lebanon in 1982 and thousands of Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) guerrillas under Yasser Arafat were evacuated by sea after a 10-week siege. Israeli troops pulled out of Lebanon in 2000.</p>

<p>In 2005, Israel withdrew settlers and soldiers from Gaza. Hamas won parliamentary elections in 2006 and seized full control of Gaza in 2007. Major fighting flared between Israel and Palestinian militants in Gaza in 2006, 2008, 2012, 2014 and 2021.</p>

<p>In 2006, Lebanon's Iran-backed Hezbollah militants captured two Israeli soldiers in the border region and Israel launched military action, triggering a six-week war.</p>

<p>There have also been two Palestinian intifadas, or uprisings, from 1987 to 1993 and 2000 to 2005. In the second, Hamas and other Palestinian militant groups carried out suicide bombings in Israel, and Israel conducted tank assaults and airstrikes on Palestinian cities.</p>

<p>Since then, there have been several rounds of hostilities between Israel and Hamas, which refuses to recognise Israel and is regarded as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the European Union, United States and other countries. Hamas says its armed activities are resistance against Israeli occupation.</p>

<h3><strong>WHAT ATTEMPTS HAVE THERE BEEN TO MAKE PEACE?</strong></h3>

<p>In 1979, Egypt became the first Arab state to sign a peace treaty with Israel, under which the Sinai Peninsula was returned to Egyptian rule.</p>

<p>In 1993, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and PLO leader Arafat shook hands on the Oslo Accords establishing limited Palestinian autonomy in the West Bank and Gaza. In 1994, Israel signed a peace treaty with Jordan. But a summit six years later attended by Arafat, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and U.S. President Bill Clinton at Camp David failed to secure a final peace deal.</p>

<p>In 2002, a proposed Arab League plan offered Israel normal relations with all Arab countries in return for a full withdrawal from the lands it took in the 1967 Middle East war, the creation of a Palestinian state and a "just solution" for Palestinian refugees. The presentation of the plan was overshadowed by Hamas, which blew up an Israeli hotel full of Holocaust survivors during a Passover seder meal.</p>

<p>Further Palestinian-Israeli peacemaking efforts have been stalled since 2014.</p>

<p>Under U.S. President Donald Trump in 2020, Israel reached deals known as the Abraham Accords to normalise ties with several Arab states, including the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Morocco.</p>

<p>Palestinians stopped dealing with the U.S. administration after Trump broke with U.S. policy by recognising Jerusalem as Israel's capital. The Palestinians seek East Jerusalem as the capital of their future state.</p>

<p>Qatar and Egypt have acted as mediators in the latest war, securing a truce late last year that lasted seven days, during which some hostages held by Hamas were exchanged for prisoners held by Israel, and more humanitarian aid flowed into Gaza.</p>

<h3><strong>WHERE DO PEACE EFFORTS STAND NOW?</strong></h3>

<p>Months of on-off talks on a further Gaza truce have so far proven fruitless, circling the same issues.</p>

<p>Above all, Hamas says it will free its remaining hostages only as part of a peace deal that ends the war. Israel says it will not end the war until Hamas is destroyed.</p>

<p>Other issues holding up a deal have included control over the border between Gaza and Egypt, the sequencing of reciprocal steps in any agreement, the number and identity of Palestinian prisoners to be released alongside Israeli hostages and free movement for Palestinians inside Gaza.</p>

<p>U.S. President Joe Biden's administration has sought a "grand bargain" in the Middle East that would include normalisation of relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia. Riyadh says this would require progress towards creating an independent Palestinian state, which Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has ruled out.</p>

<h3><strong>WHAT ARE THE MAIN ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN ISSUES?</strong></h3>

<p>A two-state solution, Israeli settlements on occupied land, the status of Jerusalem, agreed borders, and the fate of Palestinian refugees.</p>

<p>Two-state solution: An agreement that would create a state for Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza alongside Israel. Netanyahu says Israel must have security control over all land west of the Jordan River, which would preclude a sovereign Palestinian state.</p>

<p>Settlements: Most countries deem Jewish settlements built on land Israel captured in 1967 to be illegal. Israel disputes this and cites historical and biblical ties to the land. Continued settlement expansion is among the most contentious issues between Israel, the Palestinians and the international community.</p>

<p>Jerusalem: Palestinians want East Jerusalem, which includes the walled Old City's sites sacred to Muslims, Jews and Christians alike, to be the capital of their state. Israel says Jerusalem should remain its "indivisible and eternal" capital.</p>

<p>Israel's claim to Jerusalem's eastern part is not recognised internationally. Trump recognised Jerusalem as Israel's capital, without specifying the extent of its jurisdiction in the disputed city, and moved the U.S. Embassy there in 2018.</p>

<p>Refugees: Today about 5.6 million Palestinian refugees - mainly descendants of those who fled in 1948 - live in Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, the Israeli-occupied West Bank and in Gaza. About half of registered refugees remain stateless, according to the Palestinian foreign ministry, many living in crowded camps.</p>

<p>Palestinians have long demanded that refugees and their millions of descendants be allowed to return. Israel says any resettlement of Palestinian refugees must occur outside its borders.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Israeli military said one of its soldiers was killed in combat operations in Lebanon on Wednesday, marking the first loss since its forces crossed the border to target Hezbollah.</p>

<p>"Captain Eitan Itzhak Oster, aged 22... fell during combat in Lebanon," the military said in a statement.</p>

<p>A military website said Oster was killed on Wednesday, without providing further details.</p>

<p>Hezbollah said its fighters were clashing with Israeli troops who had "infiltrated" a southern border village.</p>

<p>The group said earlier it had forced Israeli soldiers to withdraw after they attempted to enter the border village of Adaysseh further northeast.</p>

<p>It was the first time the Iran-backed group said there was fighting on Lebanese soil since the start of an escalation in recent weeks when the Israeli army began pounding south Lebanon and later killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in an air strike.</p>

<p>"This is just the start of the confrontation," Hezbollah spokesman Mohammad Afif told media on a tour in the Lebanese capital's southern suburbs.</p>

<p>"The resistance in the south is at its highest level of readiness," he added, referring to Hezbollah fighters.</p>

<p>The Lebanese army also said Israeli forces had briefly breached the demarcation line between the countries.</p>

<p>"Israeli enemy forces breached the Blue Line by approximately 400 metres (yards) into Lebanese territory" in two areas, "then withdrew a short time later", it said on X.</p>

<p>Earlier Wednesday, the Israeli army called for the evacuation of additional areas in southern Lebanon, telling residents to leave over 20 villages and towns in south Lebanon.</p>

<p>The move came a day after a similar evacuation call was made by the Israeli military as it announced the launch of ground operations.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A question paper from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's entrance exam from 1869 has recently gained attention on social media for being "surprisingly easy."</p>

<p>The paper, dated June 1869, released eight years after the institute's founding. It was shared on social media by a Reddit user and had seven questions from the algebra section</p>

<blockquote class="reddit-embed-bq" data-embed-height="737" style="height:500px"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Damnthatsinteresting/comments/1fsx7kv/mit_entrance_examination_for_18691870/">MIT Entrance Examination for 1869-1870</a><br />
by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Sans010394/">u/Sans010394</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Damnthatsinteresting/">Damnthatsinteresting</a></blockquote>
<script async="" src="https://embed.reddit.com/widgets.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>

<p>The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, widely regarded as the leading institution for engineering, mathematics and science globally, has been home to over 101 Nobel laureates and 8 Fields Medalists, either as faculty or alumni since its founding in 1861, nearly 200 years ago</p>

<p>With an acceptance rate of just 4%, the institute is extremely hard to get into. Candidates must navigate multiple eligibility rounds and demonstrate exceptional academic performance. They must also perform impressive extracurricular activities, write essays. Even with these qualifications, securing a place at this renowned institution is not guaranteed.</p>

<p>The Reddit post has ignited a surge of curiosity and discussion among users, with many claiming that the exam paper is extremely easy to solve.</p>

<p>"None of the above problems require a calculator! They only require basic understanding of Algebra. Most can be solved mentally without even requiring to put pen on paper to be honest," wrote a user on Reddit.</p>

<p>"Yeah these are surprisingly easy, I didn't actually solve them but there is nothing here I don't know how to solve, and I only have high-school level math from decades ago," another user wrote.</p>

<p>While many users argued that the question paper was too easy to solve, others held a different opinion, suggesting it was harder to complete than it appeared.</p>

<p>"This just the entrance exam, and had multiple sections - it also had a geometry and arithmetic section.</p>

<p>On top of this, you'd be expected to do these calculations unaided (i.e. no slide rules). MIT hadn't developed its reputation at this point in time and was only 8 years old," wrote a user.</p>

<p>The original exam is reported to include additional sections covering geometry, arithmetic, English, and calculus.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US Vice President Kamala Harris and former president Donald Trump are hurtling toward their November election showdown, one of the closest contests in modern American history.</p>

<p>And in the handful of critical states framing the 2024 race, there is little daylight between the rivals with barely a month before Election Day on November 5.</p>

<p>Under the US Constitution, America's founding fathers established that each of the 50 states would hold its own vote for president.</p>

<p>Then, under the complex Electoral College system, each state has a certain number of "electors," based on population. Most states have a winner-take-all system that awards all electors to whoever wins the popular vote.</p>

<p>With candidates needing 270 of the 538 electors to win, elections tend to be decided in the hotly contested "swing states" with a history of alternating between Republican and Democratic candidates.</p>

<p>This year, there are seven such battlegrounds, and virtually every one is a toss-up. Here is a look:</p>

<h2><strong>PENNSYLVANIA (19 ELECTORAL COLLEGE VOTES)</strong></h2>

<p>Pennsylvania was once reliably Democratic, but these days, they don't come much tighter than the Keystone State.</p>

<p>Republican Trump won the most populous battleground, with 13 million residents, by 0.7 percentage points in 2016. Joe Biden claimed it by 1.2 percentage points in 2020.</p>

<p>Known for its "Rust Belt" cities like Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania has been blighted for decades by the steady decline of its industrial manufacturing base.</p>

<p>Trump and Harris have campaigned repeatedly in the eastern state. Trump, who survived an assassination attempt at a July rally there, is courting the rural white population and warning that migrants are overwhelming small towns.</p>

<p>Harris is touting recent infrastructure wins, and in Pittsburgh, she outlined plans to invest $100 billion in manufacturing, a key issue for state residents.</p>

<h3><strong>GEORGIA (16 ELECTORAL COLLEGE VOTES)</strong></h3>

<p>This southeastern state was an election flashpoint at the end of Trump's first term, and the controversy simmers.</p>

<p>Prosecutors in Georgia indicted Trump in an election interference case after he called state officials urging them to "find" enough votes to overturn Biden's narrow 2020 victory.</p>

<p>But in a boost for Trump, the case is paused until after the election.</p>

<p>Biden was the first Democrat to win the Peach State since 1992. Demographic changes are likely to benefit Harris, who has courted minority voters across Georgia.</p>

<h3><strong>NORTH CAROLINA (16 ELECTORAL COLLEGE VOTES)</strong></h3>

<p>The southeastern state has voted Democratic only once since 1980, but Harris believes it's back in play.</p>

<p>The population, now over 10 million, is expanding and growing more diverse, benefiting Democrats.</p>

<p>Complicating matters for Trump, a scandal involving the state's Republican gubernatorial candidate has infuriated party officials who worry it could sink Trump in a close race.</p>

<p>As in neighboring Georgia, one wild card is how the devastation from storm Helene, which recently laid waste to towns in western North Carolina, might impact the vote.</p>

<h3><strong>MICHIGAN (15 ELECTORAL COLLEGE VOTES)</strong></h3>

<p>Trump flipped Michigan, a former Democratic stronghold, on his way to defeating Hillary Clinton in 2016.</p>

<p>Biden returned it to the blue column in 2020, buoyed by unionized workers and a large Black community.</p>

<p>But this time, Harris risks losing the support of a 200,000-strong Arab-American community that has denounced Biden's -- and by extension her -- handling of the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.</p>

<h3><strong>ARIZONA (11 ELECTORAL COLLEGE VOTES)</strong></h3>

<p>The Grand Canyon state was among 2020's tightest races, with Biden triumphing by just 10,457 votes.</p>

<p>Trump hopes frustrations over the Biden-Harris administration's immigration policy will swing Arizona, which shares a border with Mexico, back in his favor.</p>

<p>Harris visited Arizona's border last week vowing to crack down on migration and work on reviving last year's bipartisan border bill, which she said Trump "tanked" for political purposes.</p>

<p>Of the battlegrounds, Arizona is showing the largest poll advantage: Trump up by two percentage points.</p>

<h3><strong>WISCONSIN (10 ELECTORAL COLLEGE VOTES)</strong></h3>

<p>Clinton lost Wisconsin after giving the state a wide berth during the 2016 campaign.</p>

<p>As with Midwestern neighbor Michigan, it was a different story when Trump's opponent was Biden, who turned a 23,000-vote deficit into a winning margin of 21,000 for Democrats.</p>

<p>Trump considers it winnable, and his party held its summer national convention there.</p>

<p>While Trump led early against Biden, Harris has a tiny polling edge.</p>

<h3><strong>NEVADA (6 ELECTORAL COLLEGE VOTES)</strong></h3>

<p>The Silver State, with a population of 3.1 million, hasn't voted Republican since 2004. Conservatives, buoyed by Trump's headway with Hispanic voters, are convinced they can flip the script.</p>

<p>Trump held a significant lead here against Biden.</p>

<p>But within weeks of becoming the Democratic nominee, Harris -- promoting her economic plans to help small businesses and combat inflation -- has erased that advantage in the western state, whose largest city Las Vegas is dominated by the hospitality industry.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[The team found traces of carbon dioxide and hydrogen peroxide on the moon, roughly half the size of Pluto.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Scientists utilizing the James Webb Space Telescope have made a groundbreaking discovery on Charon, Pluto's largest moon. For the first time, researchers have detected carbon dioxide on Charon's frozen surface, according to a study published in <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-51826-4">Nature Communications</a>. Led by the Southwest Research Institute, the team found traces of carbon dioxide and hydrogen peroxide on the moon, which is roughly half the size of Pluto. This breakthrough discovery builds upon previous findings of ice, ammonia, and organic compounds on Charon.</p>

<p>The study explains that hydrogen peroxide forms when ice is broken down by charged particles, releasing hydrogen and oxygen atoms that combine. This highly reactive compound is commonly used in bleaches and disinfectants.&nbsp;The presence of the chemical suggests Charon's icy surface is altered by ultra-violet light and solar wind from the distant Sun, according to the study. The discovery sheds new light on Charon's composition and chemical processes, offering valuable insights into the Pluto system's mysterious and icy landscape.</p>

<p>"The detection of carbon dioxide was a satisfying confirmation of our expectations. The detection of hydrogen peroxide on Charon was unexpected. I honestly did not anticipate finding evidence of it on the surface," said Silvia Protopapa, lead author of the study.</p>

<p>"Every small body in the outer solar system is a unique piece of a larger puzzle that scientists are trying to put together," Protopapa added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pluto, once hailed as the ninth and final planet in our Solar System, underwent a reclassification in 2006. The International Astronomical Union (IAU) convened to establish a formal definition of a planet, resulting in Pluto's demotion to dwarf planet status.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>About &nbsp;Pluto's Moon Charon:</strong></p>

<p>Charon was first discovered in 1978 by James Christy and Robert Harrington at the U.S. Naval Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona. This moon is remarkably similar to Pluto, earning it the nickname "Pluto's smaller twin." Measuring approximately 1,200 kilometres in diameter, Charon is half the size of Pluto, making it the largest known satellite relative to its parent body in our Solar System.</p>

<p>Charon and Pluto's orbital dance is unique. While Charon orbits Pluto, the pair also spins around a central point, resembling a double dwarf planet system. This contrasts with the Earth-Moon system, where the Moon orbits Earth without affecting its position. Pluto's failure to clear its orbit due to Charon's gravitational influence contributed to its reclassification as a dwarf planet.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[As the conflict in the Middle East escalates with Israel vowing to retaliate after the missile attacks by Iran, India Inc is bracing for a wider trade disruption across the key Red Sea route.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the conflict in the Middle East escalates with Israel vowing to retaliate after the missile attacks by Iran, India Inc is bracing for a wider trade disruption across the key Red Sea route.</p>

<p>The conflict can lead to higher cargo freight rates as Lebanon's Iran-backed Hezbollah militia has close ties with the Houthi rebels in Yemen -- responsible for most attacks on ships travelling via the Red Sea route, say industry experts, adding that a direct conflict between Israel and Iran may severely disrupt the crucial trade route for the Indian exporters.</p>

<p>The Red Sea crisis started in October last year, with Iran-backed Houthi rebels disrupting trade in the area.</p>

<p>This has affected India's petroleum exports which dropped 37.56 per cent to $5.96 billion in August this year, down from $9.54 billion in the same month last year.</p>

<p>As per a recent Crisil Ratings report, Indian companies use the Red Sea route through the Suez Canal to trade with Europe, North America, north Africa, and part of the Middle East.</p>

<p>The report mentioned that these regions accounted for 50 per cent of India's exports worth Rs 18 lakh crore and 30 per cent of imports worth Rs 17 lakh crore in FY23. The country's overall merchandise trade (exports and imports combined) in FY23 was Rs 94 lakh crore, with 68 per cent (in value terms) and 95 per cent (in volume terms) shipped by sea.</p>

<p>The attacks on ships sailing in the Red Sea area since November last year have forced companies to look for alternative, longer routes past the Cape of Good Hope.</p>

<p>The Crisil report further said that this has not only stretched delivery time by 15-20 days, but also increased the transit cost substantially because of incremental freight rates and insurance premiums.</p>

<p>Industry experts say that India's trade with the Middle East still remains healthy due to friendly regional players such as Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Kuwait, and Qatar. The bilateral trade between India and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries reached $162 billion last year.</p>

<p>As per the latest government data, the GCC now contributes 15 per cent of India's total trade and sectors like energy, defence, security and health are growing in the region.</p>

<p>Moreover, according to the latest International Monetary Fund (IMF) data, the trade via the Egyptian Suez Canal nosedived by 50 per cent (year-over-year) in the first two months of the year. In FY24, the Suez Canal's annual revenue dropped by about 23.4 per cent due to the Red Sea crisis. According to Osama Rabie, Chairman of the Suez Canal Authority (SCA), "revenues fell to $7.2 billion in the fiscal year 2023/2024 that ended in June from $9.4 billion a year earlier".</p>

<p>According to experts, the rising tensions in the Red Sea area are not only affecting the Suez Canal but also the maritime transportation market, trade movement and international supply chains.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, India issued a travel advisory for its citizens, advising them to avoid all non-essential travel to Iran due to the escalating tension in the region.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A group of Russian rescuers and volunteers have saved four killer whales stranded for hours off the Kamchatka Peninsula in Russia's far east after leading them to deeper waters, the SHOT Telegram channel reported on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Russia's emergency situations ministry had earlier warned that the whales - two orcas and two calves - were stuck in a silted estuary.</p>

<p>That prompted more than 30 rescuers to use small boats to aid the whales, dousing them with water as they tried to push them into deeper waters.</p>

<p>SHOT said the whale family had been successfully escorted out and were safe.</p>

<p>Video published by SHOT showed rescuers trying to aid the whales in the pitch dark. "All right, everybody's safe and sound," one of the rescuers is heard saying.</p>

<p>The Kamchatka Peninsula is a 1,250-kilometre-long (777 miles) peninsula in the Russian far east, some 6,500 kilometres east of Moscow.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of two California doctors who were among the five people charged in the overdose death of "Friends" star Matthew Perry is expected to plead guilty on Wednesday to a charge of illegally distributing the drug ketamine.</p>

<p>Dr. Mark Chavez has signed an agreement with prosecutors to plead guilty to a single felony count of conspiracy to distribute ketamine, a short-acting anesthetic with hallucinogenic properties.</p>

<p>Chavez is scheduled to appear in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles at 10 a.m. local time (1700 GMT) to enter his plea. At sentencing, he could face up to 10 years in prison.</p>

<p>Another physician charged in the case, Dr. Salvador Plasencia, has pleaded not guilty, as has co-defendant Jasveen Sangha, who authorities said was an illicit supplier of the drug and was known as the "ketamine queen." The pair are scheduled to go on trial in March.</p>

<p>Perry's live-in personal assistant, Kenneth Iwamasa, who admitted to injecting Perry, and the alleged middleman who said he obtained ketamine from Sangha, have already pleaded guilty to charges they faced.</p>

<p>Authorities said Plasencia purchased ketamine from Chavez, and in text messages to Chavez discussing the amount to charge Perry for the drug wrote: "I wonder how much this moron will pay."</p>

<p>Plasencia administered ketamine to Perry and supplied vials that were injected by the assistant, according to court documents.</p>

<p>Perry died at age 54 in October 2023 from "acute effects" of ketamine and other factors that caused him to lose consciousness and drown in his hot tub, according to a December 2023 autopsy report.</p>

<p>The actor had publicly acknowledged decades of substance abuse, including during the years he starred as Chandler Bing on the hit 1990s television sitcom "Friends."</p>

<p>Matt Binninger, Chavez's attorney, told reporters in August that his client was "doing everything in his power to cooperate, to help in this situation."</p>

<p>"He's incredibly remorseful," Binninger said.</p>

<p>The lawyer added that Chavez's regret stemmed not from Perry's celebrity but from the fact that "someone who was trying to seek treatment died."</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel has declared UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres as persona non grata and barred him from entering the country following his failure to "unequivocally condemn" Iran's massive missile attack on Israel.</p>

<p>A social media post from Israel's foreign ministry said, "Anyone who cannot unequivocally condemn Iran's heinous attack on Israel, as almost every country in the world has done, does not deserve to step on Israeli soil".</p>

<p>The post also said Mr Guterres is yet to denounce the massacre and sexual atrocities committed by Hamas murderers on October 7. Neither has he declared Hamas a terrorist organization.</p>

<p>"A Secretary-General who gives backing to terrorists, rapists, and murderers from Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis, and now Iran-the mothership of global terror-will be remembered as a stain on the history of the UN. Israel will continue to defend its citizens and uphold its national dignity, with or without António Guterres," the post read.&nbsp;</p>

       <description><![CDATA[In December 2021, DeWayne attempted to kill Arenda by choking her, claiming he wanted to end her suffering.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Utah man, DeWayne McCulla, 46, pleaded guilty to attempted manslaughter for choking his terminally ill wife, Arenda Lee McCulla, 47, in an alleged attempt to "ease her suffering." According to the <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/10/02/us-news/utah-husband-dewayne-mcculla-admits-to-trying-to-kill-his-wife-in-front-of-her-family-to-ease-her-suffering-in-hospice/">New York Post</a></em>, Arenda was diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma breast cancer in 2020, which spread to her brain, lungs, and liver by 2021.&nbsp;Despite undergoing multiple rounds of radiation therapy to combat her terminal breast cancer, the disease had progressed, leaving hospice care as the final option.</p>

<p>In December 2021, DeWayne attempted to kill Arenda by choking her, claiming he wanted to end her suffering. Family members intervened, pulling DeWayne off Arenda as she struggled to breathe. Investigators later learned that Arenda was "gasping for air" during the disturbing incident. She died from her long battle with the illness the next night.</p>

<p>“She didn't die with dignity,” her son Anthony Ryder told&nbsp;<em><a href="https://www.ksl.com/article/50819436/sons-complaint-led-to-charge-against-utahn-accused-of-trying-to-kill-terminally-ill-wife" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">KSL</a></em>&nbsp;in December.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In 2022, Mr Ryder filed a police report against his father, prompting an investigation.&nbsp;According to the arrest affidavit, DeWayne McCulla confessed to authorities that he had attempted to end his wife Arenda's life while she was receiving hospice care. This investigation led to McCulla's arrest and subsequent guilty plea to attempted manslaughter.&nbsp;</p>

<p>''During the conversation with DeWayne McCulla, he admitted to placing his hand over the victim Arenda's neck in an attempt to ease her suffering as she was dying from cancer and was on hospice. He said he put his face up against hers and put his one hand around her neck next to her carotid artery and pushed just hard enough to help her suffering and make her pass away quicker,''&nbsp;detectives wrote in the court documents.</p>

<p>During the investigation, DeWayne McCulla shockingly declared that "he would do it again" because of his love for his wife. He&nbsp;initially faced severe charges for attempted murder, carrying a potential sentence of 15 years to life in prison. However, he pleaded guilty to attempted manslaughter, a third-degree felony, in Utah's Fifth District Court. Instead of a lifetime imprisonment, he now faces up to five years in state prison.</p>

<p>McCulla's sentencing hearing is scheduled for December 12, where the court will determine the outcome of his case.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Late Queen Elizabeth II had a form of bone cancer in her final years, former British Prime Minister Boris Johnson claimed in his memoir.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Late Queen Elizabeth II had a form of bone cancer in her final years, former British Prime Minister Boris Johnson claimed in his memoir. In the book, titled<em> 'Unleashed',</em> which will be released on 10 October, Mr Johnson recalled the monarch's final days at Balmoral, Scotland. He also described the queen's appearance days before she died on September 8, 2022. Notably, the ex-UK PM's account is the first public indication by a former senior government official as to what the Queen's cause of death might have been. It is listed as "old age" on her death certificate.</p>

<p>"I had known for a year or more that she had a form of bone cancer, and her doctors were worried that at any time she could enter a sharp decline," Boris Johnson wrote in the excerpt, per <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/10/01/uk/boris-johnson-queen-elizabeth-ii-intl-scli/index.html" rel="noindex, nofollow"><em>CNN</em></a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the book, the 60-year-old recalled travelling to the royal residence of Balmoral for the customary outgoing audience and resignation. He described Queen Elizabeth in her last days, saying, "She seemed pale and more stooped, and she had dark bruising on her hands and wrists, probably from drips or injections".&nbsp;</p>

<p>"But her mind - as Edward (Queen's private secretary) had also said - was completely unimpaired by her illness, and from time to time in our conversation, she still flashed that great white smile in its sudden mood-lifting beauty," Mr Johnson wrote.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Also Read |&nbsp;<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/new-revelations-about-princess-diana-rumours-on-harrys-biological-father-6668803">New Revelations About Princess Diana In Memoir By Her Former Hairdresser</a></strong></p>

<p>Boris Johnson described the weekly prime minister audiences with Queen Elizabeth&nbsp;as a "privilege" and a "balm". "She radiated such an ethic of service, patience and leadership that you really felt you would, if necessary, die for her," he continued.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"That may sound barmy to some people (and totally obvious to many more), but that loyalty, primitive as it may appear, is still at the heart of our system. You need someone kind and wise, and above politics, to personify what is good about our country. She did that job brilliantly," he added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Notably, according to <em>CNN</em>, Buckingham Palace has a policy not to comment on books released about the royal family and, as such, has not confirmed or denied Mr Johnson's assertions.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in the same book, Mr Johnson has also claimed that Buckingham Palace asked him to persuade <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/boris-johnson-gave-manly-pep-talk-to-prince-harry-in-bid-to-persuade-him-to-stay-in-uk-reveals-book-6665318">Prince Harry</a> not to quit royal life or leave the UK shortly before the Sussexes moved to North America. He wrote that he delivered a "manly pep talk" to the Duke of Sussex in a bid to convince him it would be a mistake to leave Britain. He said that officials in Downing Street and Buckingham Palace approached him in January 2020, believing that he might be able to dissuade Prince Harry of his decision.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Forty-seven tigers, three lions and a panther have died in zoos in south Vietnam due to the H5N1 bird flu virus, state media said Wednesday.</p>

<p>The deaths occurred in August and September at the private My Quynh safari park in Long An province and the Vuon Xoai zoo in Dong Nai, near Ho Chi Minh City, the official Vietnam News Agency (VNA) reported.</p>

<p>According to test results from the National Centre for Animal Health Diagnosis, the animals died "because of H5N1 type A virus", VNA said.</p>

<p>The zoos declined to comment when contacted by AFP.</p>

<p>No zoo staff members in close contact with the animals had experienced respiratory symptoms, the VNA report added.</p>

<p>Education for Nature Vietnam (ENV), an NGO that focuses on wildlife conservation, said there were a total of 385 tigers living in captivity in Vietnam at the end of 2023.</p>

<p>About 310 are kept at 16 privately owned farms and zoos, while the rest are in state-owned facilities.</p>

<p>The World Health Organisation (WHO) says that since 2022, there have been increasing reports of deadly outbreaks among mammals caused by influenza viruses, including H5N1.</p>

<p>It also says H5N1 infections can range from mild to severe in humans, and in some cases can even be fatal.</p>

<p>Vietnam notified the WHO about a human fatality from the virus in March.</p>

<p>In 2004, dozens of tigers died from bird flu or were culled at the world's largest breeding farm in Thailand</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Diagnostic errors are likely to be occurring in as many as 1 in every 14 (7 per cent) hospital patients which requires new approaches to medical surveillance, a new study has stressed.</p>

<p>The study, published online in the journal BMJ Quality and Safety, said that 85 per cent of these errors are likely preventable and underscored the need for new approaches to improving surveillance to avoid these mistakes from happening in the first place.</p>

<p>The most frequent diagnoses associated with diagnostic errors included heart failure, acute kidney failure, sepsis, pneumonia, respiratory failure, altered mental state, abdominal pain and hypoxaemia (low blood oxygen levels).</p>

<p>According to the study, cases deemed to be at high risk of diagnostic error were categorised as transfer to intensive care 24 or more hours after admission, death within 90 days of admission either in hospital or after discharge and complex clinical issues but no transfer to intensive care or death within 90 days of admission.</p>

<p>"Complex clinical issues included clinical deterioration, treatment by several different medical teams, unexpected events such as cancelled surgery, unclear or discrepant diagnostic information recorded in the medical notes," the findings showed.</p>

<p>Harm was classified as minor, moderate, severe, and fatal, and whether the diagnostic error contributed to the harm and whether it was preventable were also assessed. Cases with discrepancies or uncertainty about the diagnostic error or its impact were further reviewed by an expert panel.</p>

<p>Among all the cases reviewed, diagnostic errors were found in 160 cases (154 patients). These comprised intensive care transfer (54), death within 90 days (34), complex clinical issues (52) and low risk patients (20).</p>

<p>The study authors wrote that an estimated 85 per cent of harmful diagnostic errors were preventable, with older, White, non-Hispanic, non-privately insured and high-risk patients most at risk.</p>

<p>The researchers suggested that a careful analysis of the errors and integrating AI tools into the workflow should help minimise their prevalence, by improving monitoring and triggering timely interventions.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hezbollah is planning to replicate its own "October 7-style" attack on Israel to capture the northern Galilee region, the Israeli Defence Forces have claimed as they began ground incursions into the Hezbollah stronghold on Monday. The claims of ground invasion by Israel have been denied by Hezbollah though the Lebanese government has termed it "one of the most dangerous phases of its history".</p>

<p>The October 7 attacks by the Palestinian Hamas group sparked the deadly Middle East crisis that has expanded to the Hezbollah-ruled Lebanon. Israel, which is fighting Hezbollah on its north and Hamas on its south, claims the Lebanese group was using border villages to launch a fresh assault, dubbed the 'Conquer the Galilee' operation.</p>

<h2><strong>'Conquer The Galilee'</strong></h2>

<p>The region of Galilee lies north of Israel, known for the lake Sea of Galilee where Jesus Christ is believed to have walked on water. It's a mountainous and fertile region that extends from the coastal plains to the shores of the Mediterranean Sea. Israel claims Hezbollah's rocket attacks in this northern region have forced about 60,000 Israelis out of their homes, whom they now want to rehabilitate.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-10/4kmrcgu8_israel-operation-in-lebanon_625x300_02_October_24.jpg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>Hezbollah has openly declared it plans to carry out an October 7-style massacre on an even larger scale on Israel's northern border, said IDF spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari. To facilitate their plan, they have been digging tunnels under the homes in border villages and stocking arms, he said while de-classifying Israeli operations into Lebanon.</p>

<p>The operations saw Israeli forces enter Hezbollah compounds in dozens of locations and dismantle Hezbollah infrastructure. The raids exposed Hezbollah's hidden weapons cache while over 700 Hezbollah terror assets were dismantled, said the spokesperson.</p>

<p>Here are three such operations carried out by Israeli operations in</p>

<h2><strong>Meiss El Jabal</strong></h2>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-10/pdokhcmo_meiss-el-jabal_625x300_02_October_24.jpg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>The Lebanese village of Meiss El Jabal is just a few hundred meters from Kiryat Shmona, an Israeli city. Israel claims over 20,000 residents had to flee this city due to Hezbollah attacks, so did Lebanese residents due to their "terrorist activities".</p>

<p>Hezbollah operatives dug underground infrastructure under a house in the village to store weapons, said Rear Admiral Hagari said Israeli troops. They had planned this to be their preparation area before they invade Israeli territory, he added.</p>

<p>In the basement of the house, an elevated platform was built to hide the shaft that led to an underground tunnel. The Israeli spokesperson said the tunnel was 150 metres long and excavated in stone, and they dismantled it ground and aerial strikes.</p>

<h2><strong>Kfarkela</strong></h2>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-10/aniok9ug_kfarkela-_625x300_02_October_24.jpg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>Much like Meiss El Jabal, Kfarkela is another border village only a few hundred meters from Israel's Metula. In Kfarkela, Israeli troops conducted a targeted raid on this house where a tunnel was exposed under the bed in a children's room.</p>

<p>"The soldiers went inside the tunnel shaft and revealed a 100-meter-long underground tunnel excavated in stone. The troops scanned the tunnel and found weapons stored in barrels. In one of the rooms, they exposed a weapons storage facility intended to be used by Hezbollah on the day of the planned invasion," said Rear Admiral Hagari.</p>

<h2><strong>Nurit</strong></h2>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-10/bvhvcl98_nurit_625x300_02_October_24.jpg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>Nurit lies between the Israeli border and the Lebanese village of Ayt Al Shaab. Israelis targeted what they claimed were Hezbollah targets in this village, including military outposts and rocket launchers. Here, the IDF located a "Hezbollah combat compound" that included combat trenches, both above and below the ground. "This network of trenches connects to an underground tunnel which included a weapons storage facility, a command, and control center, and preparation and living spaces for Hezbollah terrorists," said Hagari.</p>

<p>The spokesperson said Israeli soldiers raided combat trenches at the top of a mountain and found an access point to underground tunnel routes - towards the Lebanese village of Ayt Al Shaab. In the tunnel, the sounds found a large number of weapons, Israel claimed.</p>

<p>Hagari said they also found a map in a Hezbollah compound that the group planned to give to its operatives before their 'Conquer the Galilee' invasion. The map marked Israeli communities, IDF posts, access roads and targets for attack.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Western nations are ramping up contingency plans to evacuate citizens from Lebanon after a sharp escalation in the conflict between Israel and the Lebanese armed movement Hezbollah, coupled with Iran's missile attack on Israel on Tuesday.</p>

<p>No country has launched a large-scale military evacuation yet, though some are chartering aircraft as Beirut airport stays open. Plans to evacuate to Cyprus by sea will enable the movement of larger groups.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Here are details on contingency planning:</p>

<h3><strong>AUSTRALIA</strong></h3>

<p>Its contingency plans could include evacuation by sea, though authorities have urged an estimated 15,000 citizens in Lebanon to leave while Beirut airport remains open.</p>

<h3><strong>BELGIUM</strong></h3>

<p>Belgium's foreign ministry has advised citizens to leave as soon as possible, the Belga news agency said.</p>

<h3><strong>CANADA</strong></h3>

<p>News reports from Canada suggest it will cooperate with Australia in evacuating nationals by sea. The plan involves contracting a commercial vessel to ferry out 1,000 people a day, the Toronto Star newspaper said.</p>

<h3><strong>CYPRUS</strong></h3>

<p>The European Union member state closest to the Middle East is a likely hub for evacuations, having processed about 60,000 people fleeing the Hezbollah-Israel war in 2006. Neighbouring Turkey has offered facilities as well.</p>

<p>Cyprus has asked Greece to provide an aircraft that could be used to evacuate its nationals who wish to leave. There are an estimated 1,500 Cypriots in Lebanon.</p>

<h3><strong>FRANCE</strong></h3>

<p>France has not issued an evacuation order, despite having had plans for several months. Present contingency plans centre on Cyprus and Beirut airport, while it is also discussing evacuations via Turkey. France has a warship in the region, while a French helicopter carrier will arrive in the eastern Mediterranean in the coming days and take up position in case a decision is taken to evacuate foreign nationals from Lebanon.</p>

<h3><strong>GERMANY</strong></h3>

<p>Germany has evacuated non-essential staff, families of embassy workers and German nationals who are medically vulnerable from Lebanon and will support others trying to leave, the foreign and defence ministries said in a joint statement on Monday.</p>

<h3><strong>GREECE</strong></h3>

<p>The Greek foreign ministry has urged its citizens to leave Lebanon and avoid any travel there, with a frigate on standby in case assistance is needed.</p>

<h3><strong>ITALY</strong></h3>

<p>Italy has cut diplomatic staff and beefed up security personnel at its Beirut embassy. Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani has repeatedly urged nationals to leave the country and sought assurances from Israel over the safety of Italian peacekeepers in the area.</p>

<h3><strong>THE NETHERLANDS</strong></h3>

<p>The Netherlands will repatriate its citizens from Lebanon, Dutch news agency ANP said on Tuesday.</p>

<h3><strong>POLAND</strong></h3>

<p>Poland will limit staff numbers at its Beirut embassy, a foreign ministry spokesperson said on Tuesday, adding that Warsaw would organise transport for citizens wanting to leave Lebanon.</p>

<h3><strong>PORTUGAL</strong></h3>

<p>Prime Minister Luis Montenegro has advised against travel to Lebanon, which assisted in the evacuation of a small number of Portuguese citizens living there.</p>

<h3><strong>TURKEY</strong></h3>

<p>Turkey is ready for a possible evacuation of Turks from Lebanon via air and sea and is working with about 20 countries to ready its ports and airports for a possible evacuation of foreign nationals via Turkey. About 14,000 Turkish citizens were registered at the consulate in Lebanon, but the number was not definitive.</p>

<h3><strong>UNITED KINGDOM</strong></h3>

<p>Britain has urged nationals to leave immediately. It has moved about 700 troops to Cyprus, bolstering its military assets, including two Royal Navy ships. It also has two military bases on the island. Britain has chartered a flight to help meet any additional demand from Britons wishing to leave on Wednesday and will fly them directly back to London.</p>

<h3><strong>UNITED STATES</strong></h3>

<p>The United States has ordered dozens of troops deployed to Cyprus to help prepare for scenarios such as an evacuation of Americans from Lebanon. It is working with airlines to add flights out of Lebanon, with more seats for Americans, the State Department said on Tuesday.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Democrat Tim Walz and Republican JD Vance faced off in New York City on Tuesday night for their one and only vice-presidential debate, hosted by CBS News.</p>

<p>Reuters examined 12 statements made by the two running mates.</p>

<p>While Reuters monitored the entire debate, this fact check did not examine every statement. It focuses on topics and narratives that are part of broader public discourse and can be assessed with credible evidence.</p>

<h3><strong>STATEMENTS BY WALZ</strong></h3>

<h4><strong>CLAIM</strong></h4>

<p>Walz said that the US is producing more natural gas and more oil than ever before. (Timestamp 9:15 p.m. ET)</p>

<h4><strong>&nbsp;WHAT WE KNOW</strong></h4>

<p>This is mostly true. In March 2024, the government Energy Information Administration said in a release that the US had produced "more crude oil than any nation at any time" for a sixth straight year. The report added that it is unlikely the record for 2023 will be broken by another country in the "near term," as none have a production capacity of 13.0 million barrels per day. The US averaged 12.9 million barrels per day that year.</p>

<p>Monthly production of dry natural gas in the US reached a record high in December 2023, having steadily increased through most of the past decade. However, production is forecast to decline in 2024, which would mark the first time output declined since 2020.</p>

<h4><strong>CLAIM&nbsp;</strong></h4>

<p>"Donald Trump hasn't paid any federal tax in 10 of the last 15 years, and the last year as president." (9:35 p.m.)</p>

<h4><strong>WHAT WE KNOW&nbsp;</strong></h4>

<p>This is mostly true based on the information available. In 2020, the New York Times reported, based on an analysis of tax return data from 2017, that Trump had paid no income taxes in 10 of the previous 15 years. This was "largely because he reported losing much more money than he made," the Times said. Trump did pay $750 the year he won the 2020 election, the paper added, as well as in his first year in the White House. Trump had dismissed the report as "fake news."</p>

<p>In 2022, the US House Ways and Means Committee released Trump's tax returns for 2015 through 2020, which showed that Trump paid no income tax during the final full year of his presidency. "Trump and his wife, Melania, paid some form of tax during all four years, the documents showed, but were able to minimize their income taxes in several years as income from Trump's businesses was more than offset by deductions and losses," Reuters reported.</p>

<h4><strong>CLAIM</strong></h4>

<p>Minnesota's child tax credit "reduces childhood poverty by a third." (9:30 p.m.)</p>

<h4><strong>WHAT WE KNOW</strong></h4>

<p>This is unknown. The 2023 child tax credit program for low- and middle-income families was projected to cut child poverty in Minnesota by one-third based on an analysis by Columbia University's Center on Poverty &amp; Social Policy. &nbsp;</p>

<p>No report examining whether the child tax credit program did result in a one-third reduction in child poverty in the state has been published.&nbsp;</p>

<p>An August 2024 press release by the governor noted figures from the state's Department of Revenue that said the program "put over $545 million into the budgets of more than 215,000 Minnesota families" between 2023 and 2024.&nbsp;</p>

<h4><strong>CLAIM</strong></h4>

<p>Minnesota is ranked first in healthcare (9:46 p.m.)</p>

<h4><strong>WHAT WE KNOW</strong></h4>

<p>This depends on who you ask. It is true based on data published in July 2024 by the financial information site WalletHub, which Walz has previously cited as governor of Minnesota.</p>

<p>The site ranked Minnesota as the state with the best healthcare system that provides low healthcare costs, a high number of convenient care clinics per capita, a high-quality public hospital system and low emergency room wait times.</p>

<p>Minnesota also topped the chart in a Forbes analysis, but other rankings with different methodologies rate the states differently.</p>

<h4><strong>CLAIM</strong></h4>

<h4>"Minneapolis is the one city where we've seen the lowest inflation rates," the Minnesota governor said. (10:07 p.m.)</h4>

<h4><strong>WHAT WE KNOW </strong>&nbsp;</h4>

<p>This is mostly true during certain periods in the past 1.5 years. Data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics on the 12-month percentage change in the Consumer Price Index, which measures inflation across metropolitan areas, found that the Minneapolis-Saint Paul area recorded the lowest inflation rate in the country in May and July 2023, and again in March 2024.</p>

<h4><strong>CLAIM</strong></h4>

<p>Walz said Trump created the largest trade deficit in American history with China. (9:34 p.m. ET)</p>

<h4><strong>WHAT WE KNOW</strong></h4>

<p>This is true. The US trade deficit in goods with China reached a record high during Trump's second year in the White House. The trade gap rose by 11.6% to $419.2 billion in 2018, from the previous record of $375.5 billion in 2017, a Commerce Department report showed in 2019. &nbsp;</p>

<p>In 2018 under Trump, the US imposed tariffs on $250 billion worth of goods imported from China, with Beijing then retaliating with duties on $110 billion worth of American products, including soybeans and other commodities.</p>

<h3><strong>STATEMENTS BY VANCE</strong></h3>

<h4><strong>CLAIM</strong></h4>

<p>Vance said Iran "received over $100 billion in unfrozen assets thanks to the Kamala Harris administration." (Timestamp 9:06 p.m.)&nbsp;</p>

<h4><strong>WHAT WE KNOW</strong></h4>

<p>This is mixed. In August 2023, US President Joe Biden approved a prisoner swap deal between the US and Iran that involved the unfreezing of $6 billion in Iranian funds that were frozen in South Korea.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After the Iranian-backed Palestinian group Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, the U.S. said five days later that Iran would not gain access to the funds, parked in a Qatari bank, anytime soon and that Washington retained the right to freeze the funds.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Separately, Biden had previously sought to revive a 2015 nuclear deal with Iran, which had been abandoned by Donald Trump. The talks stalled in September 2022.</p>

<p>In 2015, US officials said that the deal would give Iran access to $100 billion in frozen assets if implemented. Former Israeli Prime Minister Yair Lapid said in 2022 that the deal would give Tehran $100 billion a year to destabilize the Middle East, but did not provide details for the calculation.&nbsp;</p>

<h4><strong>CLAIM</strong></h4>

<p>"When was the last time that an American president did not have a major conflict break out? The only answer is during the four years Donald Trump was president," Vance said. (9:10 p.m.)</p>

<h4><strong>WHAT WE KNOW</strong></h4>

<p>This needs more context. Trump joins other presidents such as Barack Obama, Bill Clinton, Ronald Reagan, Jimmy Carter, Gerald Ford, Richard Nixon, John F. Kennedy and Dwight D. Eisenhower in not officially bringing the US into a new war since 1945.</p>

<p>Trump's presidency, however, involved military hostilities and the risk of new wars. Trump ordered in 2020 a drone strike that killed Iranian General Qassem Soleimani, and launched in 2017 an attack on a Syrian army base, a move that marked an escalation of the US military's role in Syria.</p>

<p>The former president also said in 2017 during a speech to the United Nations General Assembly that he would "totally destroy" North Korea.</p>

<h4><strong>CLAIM</strong></h4>

<p>Vance said the US is "the cleanest economy in the entire world." (9:12 p.m.)</p>

<h4><strong>WHAT WE KNOW&nbsp;</strong></h4>

<p>This is false. According to the EU's Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research 2024 report, the US was second only to China as the highest emitter of greenhouse gas emissions globally last year.</p>

<p>The US accounted for 11.25% of global greenhouse gas emissions, while China represented 30.1%.</p>

<p>Per capita, greenhouse gas emissions in 2023 for the US stood at 17.61 tons of CO2 equivalent, higher than China's 11.11, the UK's 5.55, and Mexico's 5.15, but lower than Canada's 19.39 and Russia's 18.66.</p>

<p>In a 2024 World Economic Forum report on the Global Average Energy Transition Index, a measure of performance and readiness for clean energy transition, the US ranked 19th. Sweden tops the list, followed by Denmark, Finland, Switzerland and France.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to this year's Environmental Performance Index - a project by Yale and Columbia universities that evaluates countries based on indicators like climate change mitigation, air pollution, deforestation and biodiversity protection - the rankings put Estonia in pole position, followed by Luxembourg, and Germany. The US ranks 34th.</p>

<h4><strong>CLAIM</strong></h4>

<p>When discussing ways to address carbon emissions, Vance said Kamala Harris' policies have led to "more energy production in China, more manufacturing overseas" (9:13 pm)</p>

<h4><strong>WHAT WE KNOW</strong></h4>

<p>Vance could be referring to the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act that provides incentives to boost domestic energy production and manufacturing investment, including support for clean energy jobs and the sale of new and used electric vehicles.</p>

<p>The impact of the IRA on the US manufacturing sector is still too early to tell, but some research has found it has benefited domestic clean energy manufacturing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The IRA provides billions of dollars in tax credits to help consumers buy EVs and firms to produce renewable energy as part of the Biden administration's plan to decarbonize the U.S. power sector. China, which dominates the global battery supply chain, is among the four countries excluded from the subsidy available to firms looking to invest in the US EV supply chain.&nbsp;</p>

<p>China has since requested the World Trade Organization set up a panel to help settle the dispute over what it describes as "discriminatory subsidies."</p>

<p>Another area of the global supply chain that China dominates is solar panel production. Some Chinese-backed companies with factories in the US are claiming those subsidies for clean energy manufacturing under the IRA, and a bipartisan group of US lawmakers introduced a bill in July that would block them from claiming subsidies for their American factories. &nbsp;</p>

<h4><strong>CLAIM &nbsp;</strong></h4>

<p>Vance said Donald Trump's economic policies delivered the highest take-home pay in a generation. (9:33 p.m.)</p>

<h4><strong>WHAT WE KNOW</strong></h4>

<p>This is true. US median household income reached a record high of $68,703 during the Trump administration in 2019, a 6.8% increase from 2018 - the highest the country had seen since the U.S. Census Bureau started tracking the data in 1967.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The White House Council of Economic Advisers at the time said an increase in the number of workers in the country drove the income increase. "There were 2.2 million more people working at some point in 2019 compared with 2018, and 1.2 million more people working full-time year-round," the council added. &nbsp;</p>

<h4><strong>CLAIM&nbsp;</strong></h4>

<p>"The gross majority, close to 90% in some of the statistics I've seen, of the gun violence in this country is committed with illegally obtained firearms." (10:00 p.m.)</p>

<h4><strong>WHAT WE KNOW</strong></h4>

<p>This is misleading. Most public mass shootings - a shooting that kills four or more people - between 1966 and 2019 were carried out by legally obtained handguns, according to research funded by the National Institute of Justice.</p>

<p>The data showed "77% of those who engaged in mass shootings purchased at least some of their guns legally," an article on the 2021 study said, while 13% of the mass shootings involved illegally purchased firearms.</p>

<p>The report also noted that over 80% of individuals involved in K-12 school shootings had stolen guns from family members.</p>

<p>Between 2017 and 2021, over 1.4 million crime guns were traced to a known purchaser with a Federal Firearms License, of which 99% were acquired from a dealer, pawnbroker or manufacturer, according to a 2023 report (page 7) by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.</p>

<p>These crime guns, however, "may change hands a number of times after that first retail sale, and some of those transactions may be a theft or violate one or more regulations on firearm commerce," the report adds.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>India on Tuesday evacuated 75 Indian nationals from Syria, two days after rebel forces overthrew President Bashar Assad's authoritarian government.</p>

<p>The evacuation, coordinated by the embassies of India in Damascus and Beirut, was put into effect following an assessment of the security situation, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said.</p>

<p>"The Government of India today evacuated 75 Indian nationals from Syria, following recent developments in that country," it said in a late-night statement.</p>

<p>"The evacuees included 44 'zaireen' from Jammu and Kashmir who were stranded at Saida Zainab. All Indian nationals have safely crossed over to Lebanon and will return by available commercial flights to India," it said.</p>

<p>The MEA said the government accords the highest priority to the safety and security of Indian nationals abroad.</p>

<p>"Indian nationals remaining in Syria are advised to stay in touch with the Indian Embassy in Damascus," it said.</p>

<p>"The government will continue to monitor the situation closely," the MEA added.</p>

<p>The Syrian government collapsed on Sunday as the rebels seized control of the capital Damascus after capturing several other prominent cities and towns. Assad fled the country after the rebel group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) took control of Damascus, marking the end of his family's 50-year rule.</p>

<p>Russian state media reported that Assad is in Moscow and will be given asylum. His nearly 14-year tenure was marked by civil war, bloodshed and brutal crackdown on his political opponents.</p>

<p>The MEA Monday said it is monitoring the unfolding developments in Syria and advocated a peaceful and inclusive Syrian-led political process going forward in that country.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Outgoing US President Joe Biden on Tuesday branded his successor Donald Trump's economic plans a "disaster" in a speech hailing his own legacy in office.</p>

<p>Biden said Trump's threats to impose huge tariffs on imports were a "major mistake" and urged the Republican to abandon proposed tax cuts.</p>

<p>The lame-duck president's speech comes after Trump won a second term largely on the back of US voters' anger at the high cost of living under the Democrats.</p>

<p>"I pray to God the president-elect throws away Project 2025. I think it'd be an economic disaster for us and the region," Biden said in his speech at the Brookings Institution in Washington, referring to a conservative blueprint for a second Trump administration.</p>

<p>Coughing frequently because of a cold, Biden said US consumers would pay the price for the tariffs that Trump has vowed to slap on US neighbors Mexico and Canada and on Asia-Pacific rival China.</p>

<p>Together they are the three biggest US trading partners.</p>

<p>"I believe this approach is a major mistake," Biden added.</p>

<p><strong>- Shadow president -</strong></p>

<p>The White House had touted Biden's speech as a "major address on his economic legacy" as the 82-year-old looks to the history books with less than six weeks left in office.</p>

<p>Biden dropped out of the 2024 race against Trump in July due to concerns about his age and passed the torch to Vice President Kamala Harris, whom Trump comfortably defeated at the November polls.</p>

<p>Trump's inauguration is not until January 20 but he has already become something of a shadow president, making pronouncements on the economy and foreign policy and being feted by world leaders.</p>

<p>Biden has meanwhile kept a relatively low profile since the November 5 election, but he came out swinging in defense of his own record in front of an audience of economists.</p>

<p>He contrasted his "middle-out, bottom-up economic playbook" with what he called Trump's failed promise of "trickle-down economics" in which tax cuts for the wealthy are supposed to boost incomes across the board.</p>

<p>Biden also touted achievements including the US economy's recovery from the Covid pandemic and his huge investments in green technology and industry.</p>

<p>"President-elect Trump is receiving the strongest economy in modern history, which is the envy of the world," said Biden.</p>

<p>But the departing president said he regretted not signing his own name to Covid stimulus checks sent out to Americans, like Trump had done.</p>

<p>"I also learned something with Donald Trump. He signed checks for people for 7,400 bucks," he said. "And I didn't -- stupid!"</p>

<p>Biden ended his speech with a broader plea for US leadership in a troubled world, even as Trump has repeatedly signaled his intention to take a more isolationist stance.</p>

<p>"If we do not lead the world, what nation leads the world? Who pulls Europe together? Who tries to pull the Middle East together?"he said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Astronomers from India have made an intriguing discovery in a unique tri-star solar system located 489 light years from Earth. The discovery will help astrophysicists get a better understanding of planetary formations.</p>

<p>Astronomers from the National Institute of Science Education and Research or NISER in Odisha have made the discovery using the advanced radio telescope in Chile's Atacama Desert. Their observations, sustained over a period of time, reveal fascinating insights into the complexities of planetary formation.</p>

<p>The three-star system that was being observed was the 'GG Tau A' solar system which is in its nascent stage of planetary formations. The system is believed to be around 5 million years old. What makes it unique is that there are three 'Suns' with a massive protoplanetary disk - a rotating disk of gas and dust that forms around a young star and provides the materials for new planets to form.</p>

<p>Because the three stars orbit each other, the giant ring of gas and dust, which over time will form planets, get significantly altered due to the gravity of the stars in their orbiting pattern, giving scientists fascinating insights.</p>

<h2><strong>WHAT THE INDIAN ASTRONOMERS HAVE DISCOVERED</strong></h2>

<p>The team of astronomers from NISER was led by scientist Liton Majumdar, who is also a visiting scientist at NASA. His area of specialisation is star and planetary formations, astrochemistry, and exoplanet studies.</p>

<p>His team and he have detected molecular emissions from the protoplanetary disk which are the fundamental building blocks of planets. These emissions were found to originate in the coldest and most dense regions of the star system.</p>

<p>The team of researchers carried out their research in these coldest parts of the tri-star system, where temperatures are believed to be as low as 16 Kelvin or -257.15 degrees Celsius - well below the freezing point of carbon monoxide - key for scientists to trace the mass of gas during the formation of planets. The chemical composition of carbon monoxide - CO - carries carbon and oxygen, and reacts with other gases to form compounds like CH4 (methane). Its bright color helps astronomers model protoplanetary disks.</p>

<h2><strong>INSIGHTS FROM THE DISCOVERY</strong></h2>

<p>While scientists have been studying single star solar systems like our own, and also binary star systems like Alpha Centauri, understanding the complexities of a tri-star system is unique, and with the GG Tau A star system being as close to our solar system helps answer key questions in astrophysics.</p>

<p>It also helps understand the fundamental nature of planetary formation under the complications caused due to the gravity of three host stars.</p>

<p>Gravity, temperature, mass (energy), pressure and frequency are key aspects of physics and studying these in a three-star system gives scientists a challenge and an opportunity to make groundbreaking discoveries in such complex conditions.</p>

<h2><strong>THE RADIO TELESCOPE IN ATACAMA DESERT, CHILE</strong></h2>

<p>The astronomers from India used the Atacama Pathfinder Experiment or APEX radio telescope - one of the highest telescopes on Earth - located at a height of 5,064 meters above sea level in the Atacama desert in Chile.</p>

<p>The facility is built and operated by three European research institutes - The European Southern Observatory, The Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy, and The Onsala Space Observatory.</p>

<p>The APEX telescope is a modified ALMA (Atacama Large Millimeter Array) prototype antenna and is at the site of the ALMA observatory.</p>

<p>The ALMA telescope, also located in the Atacama Desert in Chile, is an astronomical interferometer of 66 radio telescopes which observe the electromagnetic radiation from space at millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p>

<p>Brazil's 79-year-old President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who is recovering from emergency surgery after suffering an intracranial hemorrhage, has a long history of health problems and mishaps.</p>

<p>But just as in politics, the hyperactive leftist -- who is half-way through his third term -- has bounced back from every misfortune.</p>

<h2><strong>- Lost a finger -</strong></h2>

<p>In 1964, when he was a metalworker in a car parts factory, Lula lost the little finger on his left hand in a workplace accident.</p>

<p>Lula, who was 19 at the time, said that a press broke and, when he tried to fix it, his finger was crushed.</p>

<p>He went on to become a trade union leader before entering politics.</p>

<h3><strong>- Hypertension scare -</strong></h3>

<p>Lula was forced to cancel a trip to the World Economic Forum in Davos in January 2010 after being admitted to hospital with alarmingly high blood pressure.</p>

<p>He was 64 years old at the time and nearing the end of his second term.</p>

<p>Doctors said he was suffering from stress and fatigue after a bout of flu.</p>

<p>He was discharged from hospital after a few hours and subsequently quit smoking after fifty years.</p>

<p><strong>- Larynx cancer -</strong></p>

<p>After leaving power in 2011, at 66, he was diagnosed with laryngeal cancer and underwent chemotherapy and radiotherapy.</p>

<p>Doctors announced he had made a full recovery the following year, although his once-booming voice was left with a hoarseness that became a trademark on his campaign trail return.</p>

<p>During the 2022 presidential race, which marked his stunning return to power after a year and a half behind bars on corruption charges, some of his opponents questioned his health because of his weak voice.</p>

<p>Three weeks after his re-election, he underwent surgery to remove a lesion from his vocal cords.</p>

<h3><strong>- Hip replacement -</strong></h3>

<p>In September 2023, he received a hip replacement to relieve pain that had been bothering him for over a year.</p>

<p>Lula suffers from osteoarthritis, or wear and tear on the cartilage that protects joints.</p>

<p>The image-conscious president has since published videos of himself doing exercises in the presidential residence.</p>

<h3><strong>- Bathroom fall -</strong></h3>

<p>On October 19, 2024, he fell in his bathroom and hit his head, for which he received stitches.</p>

<p>Following that accident, he canceled his participation in a meeting of the BRICS bloc in Russia and worked from his official residence for several days.</p>

<h3><strong>- Hemorrhage in head -</strong></h3>

<p>Doctors on Monday discovered an intracranial hemorrhage related to the fall, for which the president underwent emergency surgery in the early hours of December 10 in Sao Paulo.</p>

<p>His medical team assured he did not suffer any brain damage.</p>

<p>He will remain under observation in intensive care for the next 48 hours and will remain hospitalized until next week, doctors said.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President-elect Donald Trump believes birthright-citizenship is "ridiculous" and wants to end it after taking office on January 20th. A guarantee that has been enshrined in the Constitution for more than 150 years.</p>

<p>The United States grants citizenship to children born within its borders, regardless of the citizenship of its parents. However, that will soon change.</p>

<p>"We're going to have to get it changed," Mr. Trump said in an interview. "We'll maybe have to go back to the people. But we have to end it." Although he had raised this issue during his first term as well, nothing substantial happened.</p>

<p>"It's not the practice of every country, and Trump and his supporters have argued that the system is being abused and that there should be tougher standards for becoming an American citizen," Russell A Stamets, Partner at Circle of Counsels, told Business Standard.</p>

<p>The right of birthright citizenship is based on the 14th Amendment to the Constitution and is well-established under US law, so elimination would encounter significant legal challenges.</p>

<p>The 14th Amendment says, "All persons born or naturalised in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside."</p>

<p>Trump and other opponents of this policy say that this enables "birth tourism", a phenomenon where pregnant women enter the US specifically to give birth in order for their children to have US citizenship before coming back to their home countries.</p>

<p>"Simply crossing the border and having a child should not entitle anyone to citizenship," said Eric Ruark, director of research for NumbersUSA, which argues for reducing immigration, as per the Associated Press.</p>

<p>Trump also said, "I don't want to be breaking up families, so the only way you don't break up the family is you keep them together and you have to send them all back", which means legal citizens would also be expelled in order to keep families together.</p>

<p>A 2011 factsheet by the American Immigration Council says that removing birthright citizenship would affect everyone, and it will get difficult for American parents to prove citizenship of their children.</p>

<p>"Our birth certificates are proof of our citizenship. If birthright citizenship were eliminated, US citizens could no longer use their birth certificates as proof of citizenship," the factsheet says.</p>

<p>According to Pew Research's analysis of the 2022 US Census, about 4.8 million Indian-Americans are living in America, of which 34 per cent, or 1.6 million, were born in the country. These individuals are citizens of the United States under the current law. If Trump were to abolish this law, 1.6 million Indians will be impacted.</p>

<p>However, the president cannot amend the Constitution and an executive effort to restrict the right would amount to violation of the 14th Amendment.</p>

<p>"I don't take his statements very seriously. He has been saying things like this for almost a decade," Alex Nowrasteh, vice president at the pro-immigration Cato Institute told the Associated Press. "He didn't do anything to further this agenda when he was president before."<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Eight people were killed and three more injured when a six-storey residential building collapsed in central Cairo on Tuesday, Egypt's health ministry said.</p>

<p>Nine ambulances were dispatched to the scene as rescuers worked to "lift rubble and search for any wounded or bodies", health ministry spokesman Hossam Abdel Ghaffar said in a statement.</p>

<p>"I woke up to a sound of a huge explosion," Waleed Mohamed, 38, told AFP near the site of the rubble.</p>

<p>He said he and fellow neighbours ran "towards the building and saw it collapsed, the gas pipe exploded and everything was destroyed," he said.</p>

<p>A restoration order had been issued in 1993 for the building, which was constructed in the 1960s in Cairo's lower-middle income Al-Waili neighbourhood, according to district head Ahmed Awad, state newspaper Al-Ahram reported.</p>

<p>But "the building's residents had appealed the order and it was not executed," the official said.</p>

<p>Neighbouring buildings were evacuated Tuesday as a precautionary measure, according to a statement from Cairo governorate.</p>

<p>A large number of the buildings in central Cairo have gone unrestored since they were built in the 19th and early 20th centuries.</p>

<p>Greater Cairo -- a sprawling metropolis home to over 26 million people -- has seen a number of deadly building collapses in recent years, both due to the dilapidated state of some and, at times, failure to comply with building regulations.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Japan's atomic bomb survivors' group Nihon Hidankyo accepted its Nobel Peace Prize on Tuesday, pleading for the abolition of nuclear weapons that are resurging as a threat 80 years after the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings.</p>

<p>One of the three Nihon Hidankyo co-chairs, 92-year-old Nagasaki survivor Terumi Tanaka, demanded "action from governments to achieve" a nuclear-free world.</p>

<p>The prize was presented at a time when countries like Russia -- which has the world's largest nuclear arsenal -- increasingly brandish the atomic threat.</p>

<p>"I am infinitely saddened and angered that the 'nuclear taboo' threatens to be broken," Tanaka told dignitaries at Oslo's City Hall, some clad in traditional Norwegian bunads or Japanese kimonos.</p>

<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly made nuclear threats as he presses the war in Ukraine. He signed a decree in November lowering the threshold for using atomic weapons.</p>

<p>In a strike on the Ukrainian city of Dnipro a few days later, the Russian army fired a new hypersonic missile capable of carrying a nuclear warhead, although in this instance it had a regular payload.</p>

<p>Nihon Hidankyo works to rid the planet of the weapons of mass destruction, relying on testimonies from survivors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, known as "hibakusha".</p>

<p>The US bombings of the Japanese cities on August 6 and 9, 1945 killed 214,000 people, leading to Japan's surrender in World War II.</p>

<p><strong>Burnt bodies</strong></p>

<p>Tanaka was 13 years old when Nagasaki was bombed, the epicentre just three kilometres (1.8 miles) west of his home. Five members of his family were killed.</p>

<p>He was upstairs reading a book when the A-bomb was dropped.</p>

<p>"I heard the explosion and all of a sudden saw a bright white light, which surrounded everything and everything became silent," he recalled.</p>

<p>"I was really surprised. I felt my life in danger."</p>

<p>Rushing to the ground floor, he lost consciousness when two glass doors, blown out by the detonation, fell on him, though the glass did not break.</p>

<p>Three days later, he and his mother went searching for their relatives. That was when they realised the scope of the disaster.</p>

<p>"When we reached a ridge over the hills, we could look down over the city and that was when, for the first time, we saw that there was absolutely nothing left. Everything was black and charred."</p>

<p>He saw gravely wounded people fleeing the city, burnt bodies on the roadside. He and his mother cremated his aunt's body "with our own hands".</p>

<p>"I was numb, not able to feel anything."</p>

<p>Nihon Hidankyo's ranks are dwindling with every passing year. The Japanese government lists around 106,800 "hibakusha" still alive today. Their average age is 85.</p>

<p><strong>'Uphold nuclear taboo'</strong></p>

<p>For the West, the nuclear threat also comes from North Korea, which has increased its ballistic missile tests, and Iran, which is suspected of seeking to develop nuclear weapons though it denies this.</p>

<p>Nine countries now have nuclear weapons: Britain, China, France, India, North Korea, Pakistan, Russia, the United States, and, unofficially, Israel.</p>

<p>"Our movement has undoubtedly played a major role in creating the 'nuclear taboo'," Tanaka said.</p>

<p>"However, there still remain 12,000 nuclear warheads on Earth today, 4,000 of which are operationally deployed, ready for immediate launch."</p>

<p>In 2017, 122 governments negotiated and adopted a UN Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW), but the text is considered largely symbolic as no nuclear power has signed it.</p>

<p>While all ambassadors stationed in Oslo were invited to Tuesday's ceremony, the only nuclear powers in attendance were Britain, France, India, Pakistan and the United States. Russia, China, Israel and Iran were not present, the Nobel Institute said.</p>

<p>Expressing concern about the world entering "a new, more unstable nuclear age", Norwegian Nobel Committee chairman Jorgen Watne Frydnes warned that "a nuclear war could destroy our civilisation".</p>

<p>"Today's nuclear weapons ... have far greater destructive power than the two bombs used against Japan in 1945. They could kill millions of us in an instant, injure even more, and disrupt the climate catastrophically," he warned.</p>

<p>Later, the Nobel laureates for medicine, physics, chemistry, literature and economics received their prizes from Sweden's King Carl XVI Gustaf at a separate ceremony in Stockholm, followed by a banquet for some 1,250 guests.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bangladesh on Tuesday acknowledged 88 incidents of communal violence against minorities, primarily Hindus, following the ouster of then-premier Sheikh Hasina in August.</p>

<p>Interim government head Muhammad Yunus' press secretary Shafiqul Alam also said that 70 people have been arrested in those incidents.</p>

<p>He made the disclosure a day after Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri flagged regrettable incidents of attacks on minorities and conveyed India's concerns, including those related to the safety and welfare of minorities, during his meetings with the Bangladeshi leadership.</p>

<p>A total of 88 cases have been filed in incidents related to minorities from August 5 to October 22, Alam told reporters.</p>

<p>"The number of cases and arrests is likely to increase as new incidents of violence have also been reported in (northeastern Sunamganj, (central) Gazipur, and other areas," he said.</p>

<p>He added that there might be cases where some victims were members of the previous ruling party.</p>

<p>The government has so far insisted that other than a few incidents, Hindus were not attacked because of their faiths.</p>

<p>"Some attacks targeted individuals who were former members of the ruling party or they were the result of personal disputes. Nevertheless, since violence occurred, the police are taking appropriate action," he said.</p>

<p>Alam said that details regarding the incidents that took place after October 22 will be shared soon.</p>

<p>There have been a spate of incidents of violence against Hindus and other minorities, as well as attacks on temples in Bangladesh in the last few weeks that triggered strong concerns in New Delhi.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An Argentine court on Tuesday dismissed rape charges against two French international rugby players accused of assaulting a woman after playing a match in the country, the players' lawyers said.</p>

<p>"As we expected, the French players have been acquitted because the (sexual) act was consensual, meaning there was no crime and no doubt that they are innocent," defense attorney German Hnatow said after the hearing in the city of Mendoza.</p>

<p>Hugo Auradou and Oscar Jegou, both 21, were arrested two days after winning their first international caps for France against Argentina in Mendoza, about 620 miles (1,000 kilometers) west of the capital Buenos Aires.</p>

<p>Their 39-year-old accuser, whom they met in a nightclub on the night of their July 6 match, said they assaulted her viciously in a hotel room.</p>

<p>Auradou, a lock with French club Pau, and Jegou, a flanker with the club La Rochelle, insisted they had consensual sex with the woman after a night of drinking.</p>

<p>The players were kept in preventive custody for a little over a week and then under house arrest for nearly a month before being allowed to return to France in September after prosecutors said the case against them appeared flimsy.</p>

<p>The prosecution later called for the charges of aggravated rape -- a charge used for gang rape -- to be dropped.</p>

<p>The players, who returned to their Top 14 teams in France, were not present in Argentina for Tuesday's ruling.</p>

<p>Their Parisian lawyer, Antoine Vey, on Tuesday hailed their "judicial rehabilitation."</p>

<p>He added that for the players' "clubs, families and the (French rugby) federation, it was a day they have been waiting for and, which, I hope, will close the difficult chapter that they experienced."</p>

<p>The complainant has not yet announced whether she plans to appeal the decision.</p>

<p>The accusations against Auradou and Jegou, coupled with racist remarks by full-back Melvyn Jaminet, for which he was sent home and given a 34-week suspension, overshadowed the French team's summer tour of Argentina.</p>

<p>French rugby federation president Florian Grill last month announced an overhaul of disciplinary measures in the wake of the scandals.</p>

<p>He also vowed to put an end to the kind of "fourth and fifth half" post-match celebrations that took place in Mendoza.</p>

<p>"There will be financial or sporting sanctions" in the future, he continued regretting in previous years "a form of acceptance of these excesses which could sometimes even be organised."</p>

<p>"We cannot take all the positives from rugby, ask brands and partners to associate their image with our presupposed values and not respect them," he added.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Syrians lived in terror for decades of what went on behind the concrete walls of Damascus's security compound. Now the Assad dynasty has been toppled, its dungeons and torture chambers are giving up their secrets.</p>

<p>Rebel fighters stand guard at the entrances to the forbidden city in the capital's Kafr Sousa district, where the feared security services had their headquarters alongside government offices.</p>

<p>The myriad of different agencies which kept tabs on the lives of ordinary Syrians each operated their own underground prisons and interrogation chambers inside the walled defence ministry compound.</p>

<p>Syrians lived in fear of being summoned for a round of questioning from which they might never return.</p>

<p>AFP found first responder Sleiman Kahwaji wandering around the complex this week trying to locate the building where he was questioned and then detained.</p>

<p>He said he was still at secondary school when he was arrested in 2014 on suspicion of "terrorism", a frequent allegation under the rule of now toppled president Bashar al-Assad, who brooked no dissent.</p>

<p><strong>'My dear mother'</strong></p>

<p>"I spent 55 days underground," he said. "There were 55 of us in that dungeon. Two died, one from diabetes."</p>

<p>Scribbled graffiti left by the prisoners are barely legible on the walls amid the darkness.</p>

<p>"My dear mother," one had scribbled, probably in his own blood.</p>

<p>The cells that were used for solitary confinement are so small there isn't even space to lie down.</p>

<p>As many as 80 prisoners per cell were crammed into the larger ones, forcing inmates to take turns to sleep, recalls another former detainee Thaer Mustafa, who was arrested for alleged desertion.</p>

<p>All remaining prisoners were freed on Sunday after their captors fled as the rebels swept into Damascus capping the lightning offensive they launched late last month.</p>

<p>A large crowd broke into the security zone and ransacked the sprawling offices on the upper floors of the complex.</p>

<p>Thousands of intelligence files lay abandoned, many of them scattered on the floor, detailing the activities of ordinary citizens subjected to draconian surveillance by security service agents.</p>

<p>One handwritten document lists more than 10,000 prisoners held on suspicion of membership of the Muslim Brotherhood.</p>

<p>The Sunni Islamist group was anathema to the Assad clan who are members of Syria's Alawite minority, followers of an offshoot of Shiite Islam.</p>

<p>Brotherhood membership became punishable by death since 1980 two years before Assad's father and predecessor Hafez ordered the army to crush its insurgency with an assault on the central city of Hama which killed between 10,000 and 40,000 people.</p>

<p>Alongside each prisoner's name and date of birth, the security services noted the details of their detention and interrogation, and whether and when they had died.</p>

<p>Another abandoned file details the detention of a Briton of Syrian origin, who was subjected to a lie detector test over allegations he was working for British intelligence.</p>

<p><strong>Paid informers&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Another, dated this January, details the investigation into a bomb attack on the Mazzeh neighbourhood of Damascus, in which an Iraqi was wounded.</p>

<p>Nothing was considered too trivial to escape the security services' attention. There are files recording the activities of ordinary citizens as well as journalists and religious leaders.</p>

<p>Not even government ministers were immune. On a list of members of Assad's government, a security service agent has carefully noted the confession of each minister -- Sunni or Alawite, Christian or Druze.</p>

<p>The security services operated vast networks of paid informers, who provided the tiniest details of people's daily lives.</p>

<p>Families have been arriving at the gates of the Damascus security zone since Saturday, desperately seeking word on the fate of their missing loved ones.</p>

<p>Many come after first visiting Saydnaya Prison, a vast detention complex on the outskirts of Damascus where many of those who survived interrogation at security headquarters were taken for long-term incarceration.</p>

<p>"We heard that there were secret dungeons. I'm looking for my son Obada Amini, who was arrested in 2013," said Khouloud Amini, 53, her husband and daughter by her side.</p>

<p>"He was in his fourth year at the engineering faculty, I went to Saydnaya but I didn't find him.</p>

<p>"I was told there were underground dungeons here. I hope that all Syrian prisoners are freed."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A pro-Palestine essay has cost Prahlad Iyengar his career at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).</p>

<p>He was pursuing a PhD from the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, but his five-year National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship will be terminated now.</p>

<p>MIT has barred the Indian-origin student from entering the college premises over the essay, written in the college magazine last month, that the institute found calling for violence.</p>

<p>Written Revolution is a multidisciplinary student magazine, about the pro-Palestine movement, that published Iyengar's essay. It has also been banned.</p>

<p>The essay that Iyengar wrote is called 'On Pacifism'. As stated by The Commune Magazine, although not directly calling for violent resistance, the essay speaks that pacifist tactics might not be the best recourse for Palestine.</p>

<p>The essay features a logo of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a terrorist organisation according to the US State Department. However, Iyengar said that the charges of terrorism on him are only because of the photos in the essay which were not provided by him.</p>

<p>"The administration accuses me of supporting 'terrorism', because the edition in which my article appears includes images of posters from the Popular Front for the Liberation and of containing violent imagery in the publication," his statement said, which was shared by his lawyer Eric Lee on X.</p>

<p>According to the college, the essay had language that "could be interpreted as a call for more violent or destructive forms of protests at MIT". The MIT Dean of Student Life, David Warren Randall emailed this to the magazine's editors.</p>

<p>Iyengar has raised an issue of the lack of freedom of speech in American campuses. But this is not the first time he has been suspended.</p>

<p>He was suspended last year after the pro-Palestine demonstrations.</p>

<p>An "extraordinary action" is what he believes his suspension is.</p>

<p>"These extraordinary actions should concern everyone on camp," he says in the statement. "Expelling me and banning Written Revolution from campus as a result of this article would mark an unprecedented attack on the rights of the entire student body and faculty. Consider the precedent MIT has set."</p>

<p>The MIT Coalition Against Apartheid has started a protest against MIT's decision. "Prahlad is now appealing his case with the Chancellor to reduce the unjust sanctions against him. We have launched a campaign to put pressure on MIT's administration to stop criminalising students who stand on the right side of history. We call on all organisations and institutions of conscience to sign up and stand up to MIT's repression," said the coalition in a statement.</p>

<p>In an interview for a university blog post, Mangione talked about how he had started a video game development club. "In high school, I started playing a lot of independent games and stuff like that, but I wanted to make my own game, and so I learned how to code," Mangione said. "In my freshman and sophomore years of high school, I learned (on my own) how to program, and that's why I'm a computer science major now; that's how I got into it... I just really wanted to make games," he added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After graduating, the 26-year-old worked as a software engineer for the online car sales company TrueCar, according to his LinkedIn page. His most recent address was in Hawaii, NYPD officials said.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The deaths of a Thai singer and a Singaporean tourist following visits to massage parlours in Thailand have sparked warnings from the country's doctors about the potentially fatal risk such treatments can pose. According to <em>The Independent,</em> 20-year-old Thai singer Chayada Prao-hom died in hospital in northeastern Udon Thani city on Sunday. Her health reportedly deteriorated following three massage sessions since October. Similarly, a 52-year-old Singaporean tourist also died after receiving a 45-minute oil massage at a parlour in Phuket.</p>

<p>Ms Chayada had taken the massages to relieve shoulder pain, the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.independent.co.uk/asia/southeast-asia/thailand-phuket-massage-parlour-deaths-warning-b2661195.html" rel="noindex,nofollow">outlet </a>reported. In the days and weeks before her death, she posted details about the three massage sessions that she said left her bedridden, with numbness spreading through her body. She reported her condition deteriorating further with each session.</p>

<p>In November, she said she had gone to a parlour for three sessions of "a neck twist" and another massage with a "heavy hand". She found herself in a paralytic state a fortnight later, unable to lift her right arm. "I want my story to be a lesson for those who like being massaged a lot. I must recover. I want to work already," Ms Chayada wrote.</p>

<p>The hospital said that the singer died from a blood infection and brain swelling. An investigation had been launched to determine whether her death was linked to the treatments or any underlying causes. The authorities confirmed that the parlour and all the masseuses were working with proper licences.</p>

<p>In a similar incident, Singaporean tourist Lee Mun Tuk died soon after receiving an oil massage at a parlour on Patong Beach, Phuket. Police said that the tourist had fallen asleep during the procedure and started showing symptoms of distress after some time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is not clear if massages were the reason for the deaths. However, the incidents have sparked warnings from experts against some techniques used by masseuses.</p>

<p>"An experienced masseuse would not twist the client's neck because it's known as a dangerous point," said Dr Chatpon Kongfeangfung, per the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/health-environment/article/3289987/20-year-old-thai-singers-death-sparks-warnings-about-neck-twisting-massage-risks" rel="noindex,nofollow"><em>South China Morning Post</em></a>. "I've warned people before, do not ever let the masseuse twist your neck because it can be fatal," the doctor added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Professor Dr Thiravat Hemachudha, advisor to the College of Oriental Medicine at Rangsit University also warned that twisting the neck or massaging the cervical spine could lead to paralysis. If done the wrong way, he said, they could "increase the risk of harm to the blood vessel walls that supply the brain, especially the back, tearing and causing brain tissue death, hemiplegia, paralysis".</p>

<p>"The danger will increase in tandem with the force of the twisting, flicking or circling one's head. Repeating these activities for a long time will not only create problems for the nerves but also the blood vessels at the neck," Dr Thiravat said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Disease X is a term coined by WHO to describe a hypothetical, unknown pathogen with epidemic or pandemic potential.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A mysterious and deadly illness, dubbed "Disease X," has been reported in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, with over 400 cases recorded by the World Health Organization (WHO). The disease has claimed the lives of over 30 people, mostly children, since October, the <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/09/world-news/mystery-deadly-disease-x-spreads-in-congo-as-who-struggles-to-trace-origin/">New York Post </a></em>reported.&nbsp;More than half of those who died were children younger than 5 years old who were severely malnourished, the health agency said.&nbsp;However, local officials estimate the death toll to be significantly higher, at 143 deaths.</p>

<p>Notably,&nbsp;Disease X is a term coined by WHO to describe a hypothetical, unknown pathogen with epidemic or pandemic potential. It represents any unidentified infectious disease that could spread rapidly and cause widespread harm.&nbsp;Common symptoms of Disease X, include fever, cough, fatigue, and a runny nose. Headache is also a prevalent symptom. In severe cases, symptoms escalate to difficulty breathing, anaemia, and signs of acute malnutrition.</p>

<p>Based on the symptoms, acute pneumonia, influenza, COVID-19, measles and malaria are being considered as possible causes.</p>

<p>The WHO has deployed a rapid response team to investigate the outbreak, but their efforts are being hindered by the remote location of the outbreak's centre in the Kwango province. Poor road conditions and heavy rain have made it difficult for the team to access the area, with officials estimating it will take at least two days to reach the location.</p>

<p>Further complicating the investigation is the fact that many of the severe cases of "Disease X" are also characterized by severe malnutrition, making it challenging to pinpoint the exact source of the illness.</p>

<p>"These challenges, coupled with limited diagnostics in the region, have delayed the identification of the underlying cause," <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2024-DON546">the WHO said.&nbsp;</a></p>

<p>"Teams are collecting samples for laboratory testing, providing a more detailed clinical characterization of the detected cases, investigating the transmission dynamics, and actively searching for additional cases, both within health facilities and at the community level," the organization said.</p>

<p>"Given the clinical presentation and symptoms reported, and several associated deaths, acute pneumonia, influenza, COVID-19, measles and malaria are being considered as potential causal factors with malnutrition as a contributing factor. Malaria is a common disease in this area, and it may be causing or contributing to the cases," the WHO said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention has warned that Disease X may be airborne. However, the exact nature of the disease and its transmission methods remain unclear.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Syrian rebels now in power in Damascus appointed Mohammad al-Bashir as head of a transitional government that will be in place until March 1, state media said Tuesday.</p>

<p>On Sunday, the rebels led by Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) seized the capital Damascus in a lightning offensive, toppling president Bashar al-Assad who fled the country.</p>

<p>"The general command has tasked us with running the transitional government until March 1," said a statement attributed to Bashir on state television's Telegram account, referring to him as "the new Syrian prime minister".</p>

<p>Before being tapped for the role, he had been head of the rebels' so-called Salvation Government in northwest Syria and previously held the role of its development minister.</p>

<p>Also Tuesday, a source within the political affairs department of the Salvation Government told AFP Bashir would head the transitional government.</p>

<p>The Salvation Government, with its own ministries, departments, judicial and security authorities, was set up in the Idlib bastion in 2017 to assist people in the rebel-held area people cut off from government services.</p>

<p>It has since begun rolling out assistance in Aleppo, the first major city to fall from government hands after the rebels began their offensive.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Jordanian man has returned to his home country after spending 38 years in Syrian jails, an official said on Tuesday, after the fall of president Bashar al-Assad ended an agonising wait for his family.</p>

<p>The man, named as Osama Bashir Hassan al-Bataynah, was found in Syria "unconscious and suffering from memory loss", Jordanian Foreign Ministry Soufian al-Kodat told AFP.</p>

<p>Kodat said the man's relatives reported his disappearance in 1986, when he was just 18, and that he had been in jail ever since.</p>

<p>"He was transferred from Damascus to the Jaber border crossing (with Jordan) where he was handed over to border guards," added Kodat, saying the man had been reunited with his family on Tuesday morning.</p>

<p>The rebels who swept Assad from power on Sunday also opened the prisons and released thousands of detainees.</p>

<p>Civil society groups had long accused Assad of presiding over a brutal regime of arbitrary arrests, torture and murder in prisons.</p>

<p>Many foreigners were being held, including Suheil Hamawi from Lebanon who returned to his country on Monday after being locked up for 33 years.</p>

<p>The Arab Organization for Human Rights in Jordan said Tuesday there were still 236 Jordanians detained in Syria.</p>

<p>Amnesty International has documented thousands of killings at Saydnaya prison, whose name has become synonymous with the worst atrocities of Assad's rule, and dubbed it a "human slaughterhouse".</p>

<p>The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights estimated in 2022 that more than 100,000 people had died in the jails since the start of an uprising in 2011 that led to the civil war.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As Rajnath Singh and his top delegation of defence personnel continue their Russia visit, there are talks of a mega defence agreement between Moscow and New Delhi being in advanced stages. The deal - reportedly worth $4 billion will give a massive boost to India's air defence infrastructure.</p>

<p>The equipment being discussed by both sides is the advanced 'Voronezh' series radar which is manufactured by Russia's Almaz-Antey Corporation, which is a specialist organisation for manufacturing anti-aircraft missile systems and radars.</p>

<p>The Voronezh radar is a very-long-range early warning radar system with a range well over 8,000 kilometers. It is capable of identifying and tracking threats like ballistic missiles, fighter jets, and ICBMs. Should India acquire it, the advanced radar system will be able to detect any air threat from anywhere in China, South and Central Asia, and most of the Indian Ocean region.</p>

<p>The Voronezh radar can detect more than 500 objects simultaneously. While its overall range can go up to 10,000 kilometers, it's vertical range exceeds 8,000 km and horizon range is over 6,000 km. Moscow claims that the Voronezh radar system can even track stealth aircraft. Due to its massive vertical range, it can provide complete data about ICBMs and situational awareness of near-Earth objects in space.</p>

<p>According to a report by <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.rt.com/india/609068-india-russia-long-range-radars/" rel="No follow, no index" target="_blank">Russia Today</a>, talks between Moscow and New Delhi have been on for a while and last month, a team from Almaz-Antey even visited India to interact with possible offset partners who will be part of the project.</p>

<p>In another report by <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://sundayguardianlive.com/news/india-may-acquire-advanced-russian-radar-system" rel="No follow, no index" target="_blank">The Sunday Guardian</a>, there is a push under the 'Make in India' initiative for at least 60 per cent of the radar system to be manufactured locally, for which offset partners are being sought in India.</p>

<p>Should the deal be finalised, the advanced radar system will likely be set up in Karnataka's Chitradurga district, and the designated location for it has also reportedly been surveyed. Chitradurga is already home to some of India's most advanced and top secret defence and aerospace facilities.</p>

<p>The radar system, once acquired, will significantly improve India's threat-detection and surveillance capabilities in Asia and the Indian Ocean Region (IOR). It will also enhance India's air defence infrastructure to fulfil its needs amid ever-growing regional and global challenges.</p>

<p>On day 2 of his visit today, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and his Russian counterpart Andrey Belousov will co-chair a top-level meeting on military-technical cooperation between New Delhi and Moscow. India and Russia share a special, privileged, and strategic defence partnership.</p>

<p>Mr Singh will also take stock of the deliveries of the two remaining S-400 Triumph missile systems that New Delhi is yet to receive. India had signed a deal in 2018 for Russia to supply its advanced S-400 missile systems.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Doctors and healthcare professionals across the world have signed a petition calling for the immediate suspension of all COVID-19 mRNA products due to concerns that the vaccines may be contributing to an alarming rise in excess deaths.</p>

<p>"A growing body of evidence suggests that the widespread rollout of the novel Covid-19 mRNA vaccine products is contributing to an alarming rise in disability and excess deaths," reads the Hope Accord petition.</p>

<p>The petition, known as the HOPE Accord, has attracted signatures from several healthcare professionals and highlights the need for a comprehensive re-evaluation of the vaccines.</p>

<p>The vaccines use "gene-based technology" and were given emergency medical authorisation to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>"This new technology was granted emergency use authorisation to address a situation that no longer exists. Going forward, the burden of proof falls on those still advocating for these products to compellingly demonstrate that they aren't resulting in net harm. Until such evidence is presented, regulators should suspend their use as a matter of standard medical precaution," the petition mentions.</p>

<p>It demands full transparency from government bodies and the pharmaceutical industry, including access to previously undisclosed anonymised patient-level data from clinical trials and surveillance programs.</p>

<p>It also highlights the need to mitigate publication bias, where unfavourable results are often rejected or withheld due to fears of reputational damage.</p>

<p>Dr. Aseem Malhotra, a British Indian Consultant Cardiologist, has written an open letter to the General Medical Council (GMC) of the UK, stating that the vaccines cause greater harm than benefit.</p>

<p>"Serious harms from the vaccine have been confirmed from a combination of clinical, mechanistic, randomised controlled trials, observational, pharmacovigilance, and autopsy data. In these studies, the majority of deaths that occurred within two weeks of taking the vaccine died as a result of the mRNA product," he writes.</p>

<p>According to the petition, calls for independent investigations should be properly resourced to allow a comprehensive re-evaluation of all COVID-19 vaccine products.</p>

<p>"There must be a full exploration of mechanisms of harm to provide insight into their impact on the human body, both short and long term", the petition states.</p>

<p>It also urges for a comprehensive review of the actual clinical impact on illness and mortality, rather than relying on synthetic results based on modeled assumptions.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The U.S. Secret Service said on Monday it was aware of a post by billionaire Elon Musk's on the X social media platform musing about a lack of assassination attempts on President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris.</p>

<p>Musk, who owns the platform, formerly known as Twitter, put up the post after a man suspected of planning to assassinate former President Donald Trump at his golf course in West Palm Beach was arrested on Sunday.</p>

<p>A Trump supporter and the CEO of Tesla, Musk wrote on Sunday: "And no one is even trying to assassinate Biden/Kamala," a post he ended with an emoji of a face with a raised eyebrow.</p>

<p>He was quickly criticized by X users from the left and right, who said they were concerned his words to his nearly 200 million X followers could incite violence against Biden and Harris.</p>

<p>Musk deleted the post but not before the Secret Service, tasked with protecting current and former presidents, vice presidents and other notable officials, took notice.</p>

<p>"The Secret Service is aware of the social media post made by Elon Musk and as a matter of practice, we do not comment on matters involving protective intelligence," a spokesperson told Reuters in an email. "We can say, however, that the Secret Service investigates all threats related to our protectees."</p>

<p>The spokesperson declined to specify whether the agency had reached out to Musk, who seemed to suggest in follow-up posts that he had been making a joke.</p>

<p>"Well, one lesson I've learned is that just because I say something to a group and they laugh doesn't mean it's going to be all that hilarious as a post on X," he wrote. "Turns out that jokes are WAY less funny if people don't know the context and the delivery is plain text."</p>

<p>Harris, a Democrat running against the Republican Trump in the 2024 election, and Biden both issued statements on Sunday night expressing relief that Trump had not been harmed.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Pakistani man with alleged ties to Iran pleaded not guilty on Monday to charges stemming from an alleged plot to assassinate an American politician in retaliation for the killing of Iran's Revolutionary Guards top commander Qassem Soleimani.</p>

<p>Asif Merchant, 46, entered his plea to one count of attempting to commit terrorism across national boundaries and one count of murder for hire at a hearing before U.S. Magistrate Judge Robert Levy in Brooklyn.</p>

<p>The judge ordered that Merchant be detained pending trial.</p>

<p>Federal prosecutors say Merchant spent time in Iran before traveling to the United States to recruit people for the plot.</p>

<p>Merchant told a confidential informant he also planned to steal documents from one target and organize protests in the United States, prosecutors said.</p>

<p>The defendant named Donald Trump as a potential target but had not conceived the scheme as a plan to assassinate the former president, according to a person familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity.</p>

<p>Court papers do not name the alleged targets, and no attacks were made. As president, Trump had in 2020 approved the drone strike on Soleimani.</p>

<p>There are no suggestions that Merchant was tied to an apparent assassination attempt on Trump at his Florida golf course on Sunday, or a separate shooting of the Republican presidential candidate at a rally in Pennsylvania in July.</p>

<p>Merchant wore an olive-colored prison T-shirt on top of an orange undershirt to his hearing, and sported a salt-and-pepper beard.</p>

<p>He is being held at Brooklyn's Metropolitan Detention Center, following his July 15 arrest in Texas.</p>

<p>Defense lawyer Avraham Moskowitz objected at the hearing to the jail conditions.</p>

<p>He said Merchant was being held in isolation, had been allowed out for exercise only once in two months, and had lost 15 to 20 pounds (6.8 to 9.1 kg) because jail officials would not serve a halal diet appropriate for a Shi'ite Muslim.</p>

<p>"It is literally torture," Moskowitz said.</p>

<p>Prosecutor Sara Winik said she would speak with the Bureau of Prisons to ensure Merchant received an adequate diet.</p>

<p>The bureau did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>

<p>Iran's mission to the United Nations said in August that the "modus operandi" described in Merchant's court papers ran contrary to Tehran's policy of "legally prosecuting the murder of General Soleimani."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian vowed Monday to ensure the morality police will no longer "bother" women, in remarks to the media on the second anniversary of Mahsa Amini's death in custody.</p>

<p>Amini, a 22-year-old Iranian Kurd, died in police custody on September 16, 2022, days after the morality police arrested her in Tehran for an alleged breach of the Islamic republic's strict dress code for women.</p>

<p>Her death triggered months-long protests across the country, with hundreds of people, including dozens of security personnel, killed in the unrest. Thousands of demonstrators were arrested.</p>

<p>"The morality police were not supposed to confront (women). I will follow up so they don't bother" them, Pezeshkian said during his first press conference since he took office in July.</p>

<p>Pezeshkian replaced the ultraconservative Ebrahim Raisi, who died in a helicopter crash in May.</p>

<p>During his election campaign, he had vowed to "fully" oppose police patrols enforcing the mandatory hijab headscarf as well as easing long-standing internet restrictions.</p>

<p>Iran has over the years tightly controlled internet use, restricting popular social media platforms such as Facebook and X.</p>

<p>Harsher curbs were enforced following 2019 protests against fuel price hikes and during the wave of demonstrations triggered by Amini's death.</p>

<p>On Monday, Pezeshkian said his government was working to ease restrictions online, especially on social media.</p>

<p><strong>Relations with the West</strong></p>

<p>At Monday's press conference, Pezeshkian briefly touched on other topics including Iran's fraught relations with the United States and the 2015 nuclear deal.</p>

<p>"We do not want to fight with America if it respects our rights," he said.</p>

<p>"It is not us who are hostile (to the Americans). We have not built military bases around their country."</p>

<p>Iran and the United States have had no diplomatic relations since 1980, the year after the Islamic Revolution that toppled its Western-backed Shah Mohammed Reza.</p>

<p>A landmark 2015 deal between Tehran and world powers granted Iran sanctions relief in return for curbs on its nuclear programme.</p>

<p>But the deal quickly collapsed and tensions reignited following the United States' unilateral withdrawal from the accord in 2018 and reimposition of sanctions on Iran the following year.</p>

<p>Iran has since suspended its compliance with caps on nuclear activities.</p>

<p>"We are not seeking nuclear weapons; we have respected the framework of the nuclear agreement," said Pezeshkian.</p>

<p>"They (the United States) broke the agreement and forced us to do something."</p>

<p>Pezeshkian also spoke about newly imposed sanctions.</p>

<p>Last week, Britain, France and Germany announced punitive measures targeting Iranian air transport, accusing it of delivering ballistic missiles to Russia for use in the Ukraine war.</p>

<p>Iran has repeatedly denied sending any weapons to Russia for use in the war, and vowed to respond to the latest in a long string of Western sanctions on Tehran including over its nuclear activities.</p>

<p>Pezeshkian said Iran "has not given" Russia any weapons.</p>

<p>"It is possible that Iran and Russia had military cooperation in the past... because there was no ban at the time," he said.</p>

<p>"What I can say with certainty is that since our arrival, we have not given them anything so that (the West) boycotts us."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Consulate General of India in New York has strongly condemned the vandalism of a temple in New York, saying it has raised the matter with the US law enforcement authorities for prompt action against perpetrators of the "heinous act".</p>

<p>"The vandalism of the BAPS Swaminarayan Temple in Melville, New York, is unacceptable," the Indian Consulate said in a post on X Monday.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">The vandalism of the BAPS Swaminarayan Temple in Melville, New York, is unacceptable ; The Consulate <a href="https://twitter.com/IndiainNewYork?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@IndiainNewYork</a> is in touch with the community and has raised the matter with U.S. law enforcement authorities for prompt action against the perpetrators of this heinous act.…</p>
— India in New York (@IndiainNewYork) <a href="https://twitter.com/IndiainNewYork/status/1835733692162965877?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 16, 2024</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>It added that the Consulate "is in touch with the community and has raised the matter with the US law enforcement authorities for prompt action against the perpetrators of this heinous act".</p>

<p>Melville is located in Suffolk County on Long Island and is about 28 kilometres from the 16000-seater Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum where Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to address a mega community event on September 22.</p>

<p>According to footage shared online, expletives have been sprayed on the road and the signage outside the temple. The temple is expected to hold a prayer meeting later in the afternoon following the incident.</p>

<p>The Hindu American Foundation said in a post on X that the Justice Department and Department of Homeland Security "must investigate" the attack on the temple "after recent threats to Hindu institutions as a large Indian community gathering is planned in nearby Nassau County this weekend".</p>

<p>"It is hard to comprehend the absolute cowardice of those who would attack a Hindu temple to air hatred for an elected leader. This attack, following recent threats at Hindu and Indian institutions, must be seen in the context of that threat scenario," executive director of the Hindu American Foundation Suhag Shukla said in a post on X.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An organization of Taylor Swift fans said Monday they raised more than $40,000 for the Kamala Harris campaign following Donald Trump's post that he hates the pop megastar.</p>

<p>The Republican hopeful fired a Sunday morning missive on Truth Social saying "I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT!", which the "Swifties for Kamala" organization capitalized on to raise money for his Democratic rival.</p>

<p>"As soon as we saw the post, we knew this was an opportunity. Our team was ready to go with lyric response ideas and ways to tie in our calls to donate and volunteer," said Carly Long, a member of the group's communications team, in a statement.</p>

<p>"We use the memes to catch people's attention, and then tell them how to turn that emotion into action. Taylor Swifties know that haters gonna hate, but we also know we can do more than just shake, shake, shake."</p>

<p>The superfans stumping for Kamala Harris are not formally affiliated with the artist who unites them.</p>

<p>They say they've now raised more than $207,000 since kicking off their fundraising and outreach efforts less than two months ago.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago they held an inaugural fundraising call that was joined by 27,000 viewers, and featured appearances from stars like Carole King along with Senators Elizabeth Warren, Kirsten Gillibrand and Ed Markey.</p>

<p>Since then Taylor Swift herself has endorsed Harris and her running mate Tim Walz over Donald Trump, calling the Democrat and current vice president a "steady-handed, gifted leader."</p>

<p>"I'm voting for @kamalaharris because she fights for the rights and causes I believe need a warrior to champion them," Taylor Swift posted in the minutes following the Harris-Trump debate last week.</p>

<p>In addition to fundraising and phone banking, the Swifties For Kamala outfit says they are planning additional outreach efforts particularly in swing states and at remaining dates of the blockbuster Eras Tour, which is currently on break.</p>

<p>It's scheduled to pick back up in Miami on October 18.</p>

<p>Irene Kim, a Swifties For Kamala cofounder, said in a statement that the group is "proof of the power Swifties have."</p>

<p>"We're building off our existing fandom culture to make voting and politics accessible."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump on Monday blamed his election rival Kamala Harris and US President Joe Biden after he was targeted in a second apparent assassination attempt, saying their "rhetoric" about him endangering democracy is to blame.</p>

<p>Trump's rapid politicization of Sunday's incident, in which a man allegedly planned to fire on the Republican while he played golf in Florida, guaranteed that tensions ahead of the presidential election in seven weeks would continue to boil.</p>

<p>Both Biden and Harris have denounced the apparent assassination bid.</p>

<p>The suspect, identified by police as 58-year-old Ryan Wesley Routh, was arrested soon after being spotted while hiding with an assault-style rifle at the edge of Trump's golf course in West Palm Beach. US Secret Service agents opened fire, not hitting him, and he fled before surrendering without a struggle.</p>

<p>On Monday, Routh appeared in court where he was informed he was being charged with illegal firearms possession. He appeared calm and did not speak, other than to say "yes" a few times to questions from the judge.</p>

<p>The FBI announced that it is also probing "what appears to be an attempted assassination."</p>

<p>This follows an attempt targeting Trump two months ago at a rally in Pennsylvania. The former president was grazed by a bullet in that attack, which also saw a supporter in the crowd killed before the lone gunman was shot dead by return fire.</p>

<p>Trump -- who was not hurt in Sunday's event -- told Fox News Digital that rhetoric from Biden and Harris "is causing me to be shot at, when I am the one who is going to save the country."</p>

<p>Trump, 78, referred to frequent comments that he poses a "threat to democracy."</p>

<p>Biden and Harris have described Trump as a danger over his refusal to concede defeat to Biden in 2020 and his campaign to classify the mob of his supporters that stormed Congress in 2021 as political dissidents.</p>

<p>Trump -- whose main election message against Harris is built on dark warnings about immigrant "invasion" and claims that the United States is a "failing nation" that only he can save -- said his opponents "use highly inflammatory language."</p>

<p>"I can use it too -- far better than they can -- but I don't," he added.</p>

<p><strong>Secret Service scrutiny</strong></p>

<p>At the White House earlier Monday, Biden had told reporters "thank God the president is OK."</p>

<p>But the Secret Service "needs more help," he said, "and I think Congress should respond to their needs."</p>

<p>The protective service came under severe criticism after the shooting in Butler, Pennsylvania, in which the shooter was able to climb onto a nearby roof overlooking the rally.</p>

<p>As a major party candidate and former president, Trump has a sizeable security detail but smaller than that of a sitting president. This meant the bodyguards could not cordon off the entire golf course, Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw said, explaining how the suspect was able to get to within a few hundred yards of Trump before being intercepted.</p>

<p>The would-be attacker has a lengthy criminal record, according to US media, and was obsessed with the Ukrainian cause. He traveled to Ukraine, claiming he wanted to volunteer and was recruiting foreign fighters to help repel Russia's invasion, giving numerous media interviews, including to AFP in 2022.</p>

<p>However, there is no evidence that he ever fought there or was able to join the Ukrainian military. His social media presence indicates a wide variety of political affiliations at home.</p>

<p><strong>Fear of wider violence</strong></p>

<p>The intensity of threats is rising as the presidential race enters its final weeks and polls continue to indicate a tight finish on November 5.</p>

<p>The latest twist follows days of tension in the Ohio town of Springfield as a result of conspiracy theories stoked by Trump and his running mate J.D. Vance about the local Haitian immigrant community.</p>

<p>Schools and other public institutions have been repeatedly shut down there since Thursday after receiving threats.</p>

<p>There are also broader worries that Trump will again refuse to concede if he loses to Harris, stoking a repeat of the violence on January 6, 2021, when his supporters stormed Congress to try and stop certification of Biden's victory two months earlier.</p>

<p>Trump used Sunday's incident to appeal for campaign funds, posting on social media Monday: "FIGHT, FIGHT, FIGHT!!!!!" and "Donate Today!"</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ex-BBC anchor Huw Edwards, once one of the most trusted and recognisable faces on British TV, on Monday avoided jail at his sentencing over indecent pictures of children, capping a stunning fall from grace.</p>

<p>The 63-year-old presenter was instead handed a six-month sentence, suspended for two years, meaning he will not serve any time in prison if he does not reoffend.</p>

<p>Edwards guided Britons through some of their country's most seismic events over the past two decades, including the death of Queen Elizabeth II in September 2022.</p>

<p>His calm delivery -- mixed with the public broadcaster's reputation for journalistic impartiality -- made him a reassuring presence for millions.</p>

<p>But his reputation and career now lie in tatters after he pleaded guilty in July to three charges of making indecent images of children between December 2020 and August 2021.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer -- a former chief state prosecutor -- said he was "shocked and appalled" by the case.</p>

<p>Chief magistrate Paul Goldspring said at the sentencing that, if jailed, Edwards would have been at risk of "considerable harm" from others, and of suicide, adding that he had also shown remorse.</p>

<p>Edwards showed little emotion as was sentenced at Westminster Magistrates' Court in central London, sitting in the dock with his hands clasped as if in prayer.</p>

<p>He left without speaking to the assembled media, which packed out the courtroom.</p>

<p>The former anchor admitted receiving 41 indecent images of children over WhatsApp sent by a 25-year-old convicted paedophile, including seven of the most serious type.</p>

<p>Most children were aged 13 to 15 and one was between seven and nine.</p>

<p>But the magistrate said that while the offences were extremely serious there was no need for an immediate custodial sentence.</p>

<p>He ordered that he also attend a sex offenders' treatment programme for 40 days as well as 25 days of rehabilitation.</p>

<p>Defence lawyer Philip Evans told the court Edwards accepted the "repugnant nature of the images" and was "profoundly sorry" for having "betrayed so many people".</p>

<p>Edwards had faced a maximum prison sentence of 10 years.</p>

<p>He was first arrested in November last year and charged in June, but the case was only revealed publicly in late July, just days before his court appearance.</p>

<p>The Welsh presenter resigned from the BBC in April on "medical advice" after 40 years with the broadcaster.</p>

<p>The taxpayer-funded BBC, whose brand is built on public trust, has admitted being made aware by police of the arrest and has been criticised for continuing to pay Edwards a salary for six months afterwards.</p>

<p>"We are appalled by his crimes," a spokesperson said after the sentencing. "He has betrayed not just the BBC, but audiences who put their trust in him."</p>

<p><strong>'Disrepute'</strong></p>

<p>The BBC has been rocked in recent years by scandals that saw some big names revealed as serial sex offenders, amid reports of a culture of covering up.</p>

<p>Most notoriously, presenter Jimmy Savile was found to have abused hundreds of young girls over decades, with his crimes only coming to light after his death in 2011.</p>

<p>Edwards was made anchor of the BBC's flagship 10:00 pm news bulletin in 2003.</p>

<p>As well as the funeral of the late queen, Edwards narrated the wedding of heir to the throne Prince William to Kate Middleton and helmed UK general election coverage.</p>

<p>But the father-of-five's professional life began to unravel in July 2023 when he was suspended by the BBC following allegations in a tabloid newspaper that he paid a young man for explicit images.</p>

<p>Edwards did not comment on the allegations, but his wife released a statement saying her husband was "suffering from serious mental health issues" and receiving "in-patient hospital care".</p>

<p>The police's criminal investigation into Edwards started after a phone seized by officers as part of an unrelated probe revealed his participation in a WhatsApp conversation.</p>

<p>The BBC Board has said that Edwards brought the corporation into "disrepute" and that it has asked him to return his salary from the time he was arrested -- a sum of £200,000 (237,000 euros).</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>United Nations rights experts warned Monday that Israel risked becoming an international "pariah" over its "genocide" in Gaza, suggesting that the country's UN membership should be called into question.</p>

<p>Several independent UN experts decried what they said was Israel's escalating violence and rights violations in Gaza and the West Bank, its disregard for international court rulings and verbal attacks on the UN itself.</p>

<p>The rapporteurs, who are appointed by the UN Human Rights Council but who do not speak on behalf of the UN, also slammed Western countries' "double standards" and insisted Israel needed to face consequences for its actions.</p>

<p>"I think that it is unavoidable for Israel to become a pariah in the face of its continuous, relentless vilifying assault on the United Nations, (and) Palestinians," said Francesca Albanese, the UN's special rapporteur on the rights situation in the Occupied Palestinian Territory.</p>

<p>Albanese, who has repeatedly accused Israel of committing "genocide" in Gaza and who has faced harsh criticism and calls for her dismissal from Israel, asked if the country deserved "to continue to go unpunished for its relentless attacks" on the UN.</p>

<p>"Should there be a consideration of its membership as part of this organisation, which Israel seems to have zero respect for?" she rhetorically asked a Geneva press conference, speaking via video link from Tunis.</p>

<p><strong>'Double standards'</strong></p>

<p>George Katrougalos, the UN special rapporteur on the promotion of democratic and equitable international order, demanded that Israel be held to the same standards as all countries, and condemned its repeated attacks on critical UN officials or agencies.</p>

<p>"We cannot anymore stand this kind of double standards and hypocrisy," he told reporters.</p>

<p>"I trust that the progressive and democratic citizens of Israel would not let their country become a pariah like South Africa had become during the times of apartheid."</p>

<p>Pedro Arrojo-Agudo, the UN special rapporteur on the rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, meanwhile warned that Israel and its allies blatant disregard for findings by international courts, the Security Council and other UN bodies in connection with the conflict was undermining the organisation as a whole.</p>

<p>"We are blowing up the United Nations if we don't react," he warned.</p>

<p>Israel, which flatly rejects accusations that its offensive in Gaza amounts to a "genocide", responded Monday to Albanese's comments especially, charging that she was "abusing her inherently discriminatory UN mandate to spread her hate-filled political agenda, anti-Semitism and disinformation".</p>

<p>"Her attitude, including defending and justifying Hamas' actions, is a constant stain on the United Nations," the Israeli mission in Geneva said in a statement.</p>

<p><strong>'Abyss'</strong></p>

<p>The war in Gaza erupted after Hamas' October 7 attack inside Israel, which resulted in the deaths of 1,205 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.</p>

<p>Gaza operatives also seized 251 hostages, 97 of whom are still held in Gaza, including 33 the Israeli military says are dead.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory military offensive has killed at least 41,226 people in Gaza, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory.</p>

<p>Albanese lamented that in the face of "unimaginable" suffering in Gaza, the world -- first and foremost the Western countries -- "continues to remain silent".</p>

<p>Arrojo-Agudo charged that the deprivation of water in the besieged Palestinian territory was "clearly employed as a weapon".</p>

<p>He said Gaza's population currently accesses on average just 4.7 litres of water per person per day, compared to more than 100 litres typically considered sufficient to cover daily needs.</p>

<p>Speaking before the UN rights council Monday, an Israeli representative rejected that allegation, charging that Hamas had "completely mismanaged water in Gaza and is responsible for the irreversible damage to 95 percent of natural water resources".<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A man suspected of plotting to assassinate former US president Donald Trump was charged with federal gun crimes on Monday.</p>

<p>Ryan Wesley Routh, 58, was charged with possession of a firearm as a convicted felon and possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number at his initial court appearance.</p>

<p>Routh, who was arrested on Sunday after an alleged abortive bid to shoot the Republican presidential candidate at his West Palm Beach golf course, is expected to face further charges at a later date.</p>

<p>Routh appeared calm during the brief court hearing before Magistrate Judge Ryon McCabe of the Southern District of Florida, answering "yes" to several questions.</p>

<p>A detention hearing was scheduled for September 23 and an arraignment on further potential charges was set for September 30.</p>

<p>Routh was arrested on Sunday after a Secret Service agent on the former president's security detail saw what appeared to be the barrel of a rifle pointing out of a tree line on the perimeter of the Trump International Golf Course, according to a criminal complaint filed by an FBI special agent.</p>

<p>"The Agent fired his/her service weapon in the direction of the rifle," the complaint said.</p>

<p>Trump, who was slightly wounded in a July 13 assassination attempt during a campaign rally in Pennsylvania, was several hundred yards away when the golf course shooting occurred and was unharmed.</p>

<p>A man later identified as Routh was seen by a witness fleeing the area in a Nissan sport utility vehicle at high speed, the complaint said.</p>

<p>Routh was arrested by local police about 45 minutes later on I-95, a major north-south highway, and replied in the "affirmative" when asked if he knew why he was being stopped, it said.</p>

<p>Video footage of the arrest showed Routh, who was wearing sunglasses and dressed in a peach-colored shirt, being taken into custody by the roadside without incident by heavily armed police officers.</p>

<p>According to the complaint, a "loaded SKS-style, 7.62x39 caliber rifle with a scope," a digital camera, a backpack and a black plastic bag containing food were recovered from the tree line.</p>

<p><strong>Criminal convictions</strong></p>

<p>Routh appears to have spent nearly 12 hours on the perimeter of the Trump golf course.</p>

<p>"Routh's mobile phone was located in the vicinity of the area along the tree line... from approximately 1:59 am until approximately 1:31 pm on September 15," the complaint said.</p>

<p>Routh is reported to be a self-employed builder based in Hawaii, with an arrest record spanning decades.</p>

<p>He regularly posted about politics and current events on social media, including criticism of Trump, according to US media.</p>

<p>According to the criminal complaint, he was convicted in North Carolina in December 2002 of "possession of a weapon of mass death and destruction."</p>

<p>He was convicted in 2010 in the same state of multiple counts of possession of stolen goods, it said.</p>

<p>Possession of a firearm by a convicted felon carries a maximum penalty of 15 years in prison. Possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number carries a maximum five-year sentence.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Elon Musk has deleted a post he wrote on X after the assassination attempt on former US President Donald Trump on Sunday in Florida. The billionaire had questioned why no one is trying to assassinate President Joe Biden and Democratic presidential candidate and Vice President Kamala Harris.</p>

<p>Responding to a post X that read, "Why they want to kill Donald Trump?", Mr Musk wrote: "And no one is even trying to assassinate Biden/Kamala."</p>

</div>

<p>However, his post has now been deleted.</p>

<p>The post had sparked a massive controversy, with one X user writing, "This at the least demands a visit from the FBI and Secret Service." Another person said they reported the post to X as "coded incitement of violence".</p>

<p>The Tesla and SpaceX chief is an open supporter of Mr Trump as the latter is set to go head-to-head with Vice President Harris in the upcoming US Presidential elections in November.</p>

<p>Donald Trump's campaign and law enforcement officials have reported that the Republican presidential candidate is safe after the assassination attempt at his golf course.</p>

<p>The US Secret Service confirmed one or more of its agents "opened fire on a gunman" located near the boundary of Mr Trump's golf course, and that an "AK-47 style rifle" with a scope was recovered along with a GoPro video camera.</p>

<p>This is the second attempt to assassinate Donald Trump this year, the first was two months ago when he was wounded in the ear after a gunman opened fire during a rally in Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>Suspect Ryan Wesley Routh has been arrested in connection with the latest shooting. He was set up in the bushes near the sixth hole of the Trump International Golf Club, according to law enforcement officials.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The temporary mini-moon of Earth, which will orbit our planet for 53 days, will not be visible to the naked eye, confirmed Dr AK Anil Kumar, head of ISRO's Network for Space Objects Tracking and Analysis (NETRA). The mini-moon, called 2024 PT5, is just 10 meters in diameter. It is 350,000 times smaller than the regular moon, which has a diameter of 3,476 kilometres, and hence, will be undetectable by the naked eye.</p>

<p>NETRA is monitoring the movement of 2024 PT5 and has confirmed that the asteroid will not collide with Earth. The mini-moon will start orbiting the Earth for almost two months on September 29 before breaking away from the elliptical force of the Earth and heading back into the vastness of the solar system on November 25.</p>

<p>The asteroid, discovered on August 7 by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS), an automated system funded by NASA to monitor near-earth objects, also has a connection to the Hindu epic Mahabharata. In a report published in Research Notes of the American Astronomical Society (RNAAS), astronomers say that orbital properties of 2024 PT5 resemble that of asteroids that come from the Arjuna asteroid belt, "a sparsely resonant population of small NEOs." Dr Anil Kumar of NETRA also confirms that 2024 PT5 is part of the Arjuna Asteroid grouping.</p>

<p>The 'Arjuna' is a unique group of asteroids in the solar system. The naming of this asteroid group can be traced back to 1991 when Astronomer Robert H. McNaught discovered an asteroid '1991 VG' at the Siding Spring Observatory in Australia on November 1 of that year. The name 'Arjuna' was chosen by him inspired by the character in the Hindu epic Mahabharata. It was officially approved by the International Astronomical Union (IAU).</p>

<p>In Hindu mythology, Arjuna is known for his bravery, unparalleled archery skills, and wisdom. The name reflects the asteroid's swift passage through the solar system, like Arjuna's swift arrows, and its unpredictable nature.</p>

<p>Carlos de la Fuente Marcos and Raul de la Fuente Marcos, the astronomers who authored the RNAAS report said, "near-Earth objects (NEOs) that follow horseshoe paths, and approach our planet at close range and low relative velocity, may undergo mini-moon events in which their geocentric energy becomes negative for hours, days or months, but without completing one revolution around Earth."</p>

<p>They also said this is not the first time a mini-moon will appear around the Earth. Similar phenomena have happened earlier in 1997, 2013, and 2018.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi said India is preparing for a sustainable energy path for the next 1,000 years, focusing on solar, wind, nuclear and hydropower.</p>

<p>Addressing the inaugural day of the 4th Global Renewable Energy Investor's Meet (RE-INVEST) 2024, the PM said, "Our aim is not to reach the top but to remain on top. Today, not only Indians but the entire world feels that India is the best bet of the 21st century. Global Fintech Fest was organised earlier this month, after which people from all over the world participated in the first solar international festival. Then people from every corner of the world came to the Global Semiconductor Summit and today we are gathered here to discuss the future of Green Energy."</p>

<p>"We don't have vast reserves of oil and gas, we are not energy producers. Therefore, we have focused on solar power, wind power, nuclear, and hydropower to secure our future. We are determined to build a sustainable energy path forward," he said.</p>

<p>RE-INVEST 2024 is being organised by the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) at Mahatma Mandir, Gandhinagar, Gujarat.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The PM emphasised the government's initiatives towards green energy in the first 100 days of the third term. "In the past 100 days, we've made significant decisions to support green energy. We have launched the Offshore Green Energy Policy under the Vibrant Gas Funding Scheme, where we plan to spend over Rs 7,000 crore. India is also working on generating 31,000 megawatts of hydropower, for which we will spend more than Rs 12,000 crore," he said.</p>

<p>The PM also highlighted the efforts towards achieving the target of installing 500 gigawatts of renewable energy capacity in India by 2030. "Among the G20 nations, we are leading. The country that could not be seen as a developed nation before will now set an example for the world as a developing one," he said.</p>

<h2><strong>INDIA'S RENEWABLE ENERGY GOALS</strong></h2>

<p>At the 26th Conference of the Parties (COP26) in Glasgow in 2021, PM Modi had outlined a climate action plan for the country. This included meeting 50 per cent of the country's energy requirements from renewable energy by 2030, reaching 500 GW of non-fossil energy capacity by 2030 and achieving net zero emissions by 2070.</p>

<p>Since then, India has achieved substantial progress in installing renewable energy capacity, securing the fourth position globally in 2022, according to the Climate Action Tracker.</p>

<p>As part of its climate efforts, India conceived the International Solar Alliance (ISA) jointly with France. It was conceptualised on the sidelines of the COP21 to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) held in Paris in 2015. It is a treaty-based intergovernmental organisation which has 99 member countries and 119 countries are signatories to the ISA Framework Agreement.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The ISA, headquartered in India, aims at increased use of solar energy technologies for better energy access, ensuring energy security and enabling energy transition in member countries. It seeks to mobilise $1,000 billion of investment by 2030 for deployment of solar energy.</p>

<p>India's installed solar energy capacity has increased by 30 times in the last 9 years and stands at 89.4 GW as of August 2024, as per government data. Similarly, the installed capacity of wind power stood at 47.19 GW, small hydro power capacity was 5.07 GW and large hydro power capacity stood at 46.92 GW, official data showed.</p>

<p>Notably, India is the only G20 nation to have achieved - before the deadline - climate goals committed at the Paris climate change conference in 2015.</p>

<p>In 2022, India updated its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) or climate goals, according to which the target to reduce emissions intensity of its GDP had been enhanced to 45 per cent by 2030 from 2005 level.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The initiative comes as Russia's fertility rate, currently at about 1.5 children per woman, falls significantly below the 2.1 rate required to maintain a stable population.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has reportedly encouraged Russians to engage in intimate relations during lunch and coffee breaks at work to address the country's declining birth rate. The initiative comes as Russia's fertility rate, currently at about 1.5 children per woman, falls significantly below the 2.1 rate required to maintain a stable population, <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://metro.co.uk/2024/09/15/vladimir-putin-demands-russians-sex-work-fall-birth-rate-21608541/" rel="nofollow, noindex">Metro</a></em> reported. Additionally, over a million, primarily younger Russians, have left the country amid the ongoing war with Ukraine</p>

<p>Health Minister Dr Yevgeny Shestopalov emphasised that being too busy at work is not a valid excuse for avoiding procreation. He suggested that people could take advantage of breaks to focus on expanding their families, noting that ''life flies by too quickly.''</p>

<p>When a reporter asked him how people working 12 to 14 hours a day would find time to have children, he responded by suggesting they could use their break times.</p>

<p>Previously, Putin has insisted, ''The preservation of the Russian people is our highest national priority. The fate of Russia....depends on how many of us there will be. It is a question of national importance.''</p>

<p>Notably, Russia's birth rate has hit its lowest point since 1999, with the number of live births in June falling below 100,000. This drastic drop has raised concerns in Moscow about a severe population decline. According to Rosstat, Russia's governmental statistics agency, the country has seen a significant decrease in births, with 16,000 fewer children born between January and June 2024 compared to the same period last year, as per <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.euronews.com/2024/09/10/russias-birth-rate-drops-to-its-lowest-in-a-quarter-century-data-shows"><em>Euro News</em></a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This decline is further exacerbated by an 18% increase in population decline, with 49,000 more deaths recorded in 2024 than the previous year, likely due to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.</p>

<p>The Kremlin's efforts to boost Russia's declining birth rate have led to a series of measures, including:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Free fertility checks: Women in Moscow, aged 18-40, are encouraged to undergo free fertility assessments to evaluate their "reproductive potential".</li>
	<li>Employer coercion: MP Tatyana Butskaya has proposed a plan to pressure employers into encouraging their female employees to have children.</li>
	<li>Incentives:&nbsp;Chelyabinsk region is offering&nbsp;8,500 pounds&nbsp;to female students under 24 for their first child's birth</li>
	<li>Restricting abortion: Access to abortion across the country is being blocked as public figures and churchmen claim women's duty is to give birth and raise children.</li>
	<li>Divorce fees:&nbsp;Fees for divorce have been increased to discourage separation.</li>
</ul>

<p>Politician Anna Kuznetsova has also demanded women start giving birth at a young age. She said: ''You should start giving birth at 19-20 years old. Then, statistically, the family will be able to have three, four, or more children.''</p>

<p>However, critics argue these policies undermine individual autonomy, particularly for women, and may have unintended consequences on Russia's social fabric.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Necrotising fasciitis is a rare and life-threatening infection that can happen if a wound gets infected and it needs to be treated in a hospital straight away.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nigel Hunt, a 59-year-old British man from the Isles of Scilly, narrowly escaped death after a seemingly minor spider bite that turned into a life-threatening ordeal. While lying in bed at home on August 30, Mr Hunt was bitten by a potentially deadly spider on his stomach. Initially, he felt no pain and thought nothing of it. However, just four days later, on his way to a holiday in Sharm El-Sheikh,&nbsp;Egypt, he became severely ill,&nbsp;<em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce9zly12zk0o" rel="nofollow, noindex">BBC</a></em> reported. He was rushed to the hospital, where doctors operated on his stomach after suspecting an abscess.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, further diagnosis revealed something far more serious- necrotising fasciitis, a rare and deadly condition known as "flesh-eating disease." He then underwent an emergency surgery, that saved his life.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Speaking of the ordeal, he recounted, ''On arriving at the airport and&nbsp;travelling through check-in we made our way to departures. At this point, everything seemed to deteriorate quite quickly from being sick in the departure lounge to having my head in a sick bag for most of the journey. On arrival at Sharm El Sheikh, we collected our belongings and made our way to the pharmacy for some antibiotics or something to help with the sickness. They prescribed a couple of things and the following day we went to the hospital to be prescribed the same medication.''</p>

<p>''The&nbsp;next two days started to get worse so we went to a different hospital in Hadaba where straight away I had blood tests and ultrasound scans. Then we waited a couple of hours for the doctor to check the results. He called us in saying it was a good job we had come in because the bite was from either a false widow or a brown recluse spider,'' he added.</p>

<p>According to the&nbsp;<em><a data-content-type="section-topic" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/nhs">NHS</a></em>&nbsp;website, necrotising fasciitis is a rare and life-threatening infection that can happen if a wound gets infected and it needs to be treated in a hospital straight away.</p>

<p>Mr&nbsp;Hunt credits his second hospital visit with saving his life. He recalls, "If I hadn't gone back to the hospital for a second examination within that critical 6-10 day window, I wouldn't be alive today."</p>

<p>Although he's on the road to recovery, Mr Hunt still faces a long journey ahead. His wound remains open, requiring regular dressing changes every few days.</p>

<p>He has also issued a stark warning to his fellow residents on the Isles of Scilly. "I feel it's essential to alert everyone to be cautious and check for spiders," he emphasised.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Villa Palmieri spans nearly 4,000 square metres and boasts 23 bedrooms, 19 bathrooms and expansive gardens]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">A historic Tuscan villa once cherished by Queen Victoria is now on the market for a staggering $55 million (roughly Rs 460 crore). Located in the hills on the outskirts of Florence, this sprawling villa spans nearly 4,000 square metres and is set amid nine hectares (22 acres) of maintained gardens, reportedly making it the second-largest park in the city. The estate boasts 23 bedrooms, 19 bathrooms and expansive gardens that include a tennis court, a helipad and an ancient swimming pool. Originally built in the 14th century, the villa has had various notable owners, including Queen Victoria, who stayed there in the late 19th century.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The villa's historic allure extends beyond its royal connections. It is reputedly mentioned in Giovanni Boccaccio's ‘Decameron,' one of Italy's most renowned literary works<a href="http://https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/15/style/queen-victoria-tuscan-villa-intl-scli/index.html">. According to a report in CNN</a>, the property is now listed by Dreamer Real Estate, which is handling the sale.</p>

<p>The Villa Palmieri was initially owned by the Fini family before being acquired by Matteo di Marco Palmieri in 1454, giving the property its name. The villa entered English hands in 1760 when it was purchased by the third Earl Cowper. It subsequently came into the possession of the Earl of Crawford and Balcarres, during which time it became a cherished retreat for Queen Victoria.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Queen Victoria's connection to Villa Palmieri is well-documented and dates to her visits in 1888, 1893 and 1894. During her stays, she arranged for several home comforts to be transported to the villa, including a bedstead, armchairs, a sofa, a writing table, and a bath, alongside portraits of her late husband, Prince Albert. There are still some trees in the garden with plaques honouring her stay there. The New York Times reported in 1888 that the Queen appreciated the villa's seclusion it offered. The report stated, “The Queen much appreciates the complete seclusion of the villa and the perfectly monastic quiet which it affords.”</p>

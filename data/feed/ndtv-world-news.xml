       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US Department of Justice (DOJ) has alleged that several prominent right-wing social media influencers were unknowingly part of a Russian operation designed to sway the 2024 US presidential elections, CNN reported. The influencers, who collectively reach millions of Americans, were allegedly used as "mouthpieces" for Russian propaganda without being aware of the foreign influence behind their financial support.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/07/media/tenet-media-russia-rt-tim-pool-dave-rubin-lauren-chen/index.html" target="_blank">According to the report</a>, court documents unsealed this week revealed that Russian state media funnelled nearly $10 million through a Tennessee-based online media company, identified by CNN as Tenet Media. The company employed well-known right-wing commentators such as Tim Pool, Benny Johnson, Lauren Southern, Tayler Hansen, Matt Christiansen, and Dave Rubin. While these individuals were not directly accused of wrongdoing, the indictment has shed light on how they may have unknowingly advanced Russian interests.</p>

<p>Two employees of Russian state media were charged with conspiracy to violate the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) and money laundering. The DOJ states that Russia's goal was to push narratives that aligned with Kremlin objectives, such as promoting domestic political division, weakening US support for Ukraine, and boosting conservative figures like Donald Trump.</p>

<p>These individuals, unaware of their role in Russian operations, were described in Cold War terms as "useful idiots."</p>

<h2><strong>Tenet Media</strong></h2>

<p>Tenet Media, launched last year, presents itself as a platform for "heterodox views" on Western political and cultural issues. It was founded in 2022 by conservative Canadian YouTuber Lauren Chen and her husband Liam Donovan. The company has not responded to the allegations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Its roster includes several former mainstream journalists turned independent creators, such as Tim Pool, who previously worked with Vice, and Benny Johnson, formerly of BuzzFeed and the Independent Journal Review. The outlet has grown in influence, hosting shows featuring far-right personalities and interviewing high-profile figures like Donald Trump.</p>

<p>Though the influencers claimed to retain full editorial control over their content, the DOJ alleges that the content they produced served Russia's interests. According to court documents, Russian state media employees from RT sought to exploit these influencers' vast audiences by amplifying pro-Russian narratives, including criticisms of US support for Ukraine and divisive discussions on LGBTQ issues.</p>

<p>While none of the commentators have been charged, the DOJ alleges that they were paid by Kremlin-controlled sources to promote content that benefitted Russian interests. At least three of the influencers have been contacted by the FBI for voluntary interviews.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>What The Influencers said</strong></h2>

<p>Tim Pool, host of The Culture War Podcast, responded to the allegations by saying that he was a victim. "If these allegations prove true, I as well as the other personalities and commentators were deceived and are victims. I cannot speak for anyone else at the company as to what they do or to what they are instructed," Pool told his 2.1 million followers on X.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Disturbed by the allegations in today's indictment, which make clear that myself and other influencers were victims in this alleged scheme," said Benny Johnson who has 2.7 million followers on X.&nbsp;</p>

<p></p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Dave Rubin, host of The Rubin Report, claimed that his show with Tenet Media ended months ago. "I and other commentators were the victims of this scheme. I knew absolutely nothing about any of this fraudulent activity," Rubin told his 1.5 million followers on X.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>DOJ Action&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p>The DOJ has charged two RT employees, Kostiantyn Kalashnikov and Elena Afanasyeva, with conspiracy to commit money laundering and violating the Foreign Agents Registration Act, the BBC reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The indictment accuses these individuals of overseeing funding and editorial operations while secretly directing Tenet Media's output to advance Russian interests. Despite the influencers' claims of independence, federal prosecutors assert that much of the content was strategically aligned with Russian efforts to amplify divisions within the US.</p>

<p>The indictment also alleges elaborate lengths to which the Russian operation went, including the creation of a fake Hungarian investor to mask RT's involvement and the high salaries paid to the influencers allegedly receiving up to $100,000 per video.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>CEO of Telegram Pavel Durov has spoken for the first time since his arrest last month. The Russian-born CEO was arrested in Paris on charges of publishing extremist and illegal content.</p>

<p>Calling his arrest "surprising" and the charges against him "misguided", Durov promised that changes will be brought to some features in Telegram features in order to "improve" the app's efforts to prevent criminals from misusing the platform.</p>

<p>The 39-year-old was arrested after he was accused of failing to remove illegal content like child pornography from Telegram. His bail was set at $5.6 million and he is required to report to a police station twice a week.</p>

<p>French authorities said Telegram did not reply to their requests for information regarding suspicious criminal activity on its app, including drug trafficking.</p>

<p>Mr Durov argued that a CEO should not be responsible if a platform is "potentially abused". Stating that building technology is "hard as it is", he said that if CEOs were held responsible, no one would ever innovate.</p>

<p>"Using laws from the pre-smartphone era to charge a CEO with crimes committed by third parties on the platform he manages is a misguided approach. Building technology is hard enough as it is. No innovator will ever build new tools if they know they can be personally held responsible for potential abuse of those tools," he said.</p>

<p>Mr Durov also spoke of his arrest saying he was questioned by police for four days. "I was told I may be personally responsible for other people's illegal use of Telegram because the French authorities didn't receive responses from Telegram," he said, adding that if they wanted to ask for his help, they could have just "Googled Telegram EU address".</p>

<p>While arguing that the level of moderation on Telegram is low compared to other social media or messaging apps, Mr Durov stated that the platform did remove objectionable content.</p>

<p>"Claims in some media that Telegram is some sort of anarchic paradise are absolutely untrue. We take down millions of harmful posts and channels every day. However, we hear voices saying that it's not enough," he said.</p>

<p>He also announced the removal of some features like its blogging tool Telegraph</p>

<p>"While 99.999% of Telegram users have nothing to do with crime, the 0.001% involved in illicit activities create a bad image for the entire platform, putting the interests of our almost billion users at risk," he said.</p>

<p>Citing examples of Iran and Russia, both regimes that he claimed sought to censor and surveil their citizens, the CEO said Telegram was ready to leave any country that abused the app users' right to privacy.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Multiple people have been shot along a highway in the US state of Kentucky, authorities said Saturday, as authorities in the southern state hunted for the perpetrator.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kentucky police were searching rugged terrain near a national forest for a suspect after at least seven people were wounded by gunfire while driving down the rural stretch of an interstate highway, officials said on Saturday evening.</p>

<p>The incident began just before 6 p.m. (1000 GMT) about nine miles outside of the town of London, when officers responded to reports of gunshots directed at vehicles traveling on Interstate 75 in Laurel County. The shots came from a wooded area or an overpass, according to local media reports.</p>

<p>Mayor Randall Weddle of London, a small city of about 8,000 near the Daniel Boone National Forest, about 90 miles (145 km) south of Lexington, said in a post on Facebook that seven people were injured, including some who were shot. He said there were no known fatalities. Police offered no further details about the number or nature of any casualties.</p>

<p>Weddle asked everyone in the area to "keep your doors locked while this guy is on the loose."</p>

<p>A stretch of highway near the Kentucky shootings was closed but later reopened even though the suspect was still at large.</p>

<p>About three hours after the shooting, the Laurel County Sheriff's Office named a "person of interest" who it said was "armed and dangerous" and cautioned the public not to approach the 32-year-old man.</p>

<p>"The below individual, Joseph A Couch, is a Person of Interest in the shooting that occurred at the Exit 49/KY-909 area. If you have any information regarding the whereabouts or location of this individual, please contact the London-Laurel County 911 Center by calling 911 or 606-878-7000.&nbsp; ***DO NOT ATTEMPT TO APPROACH***. Joseph A Couch is a 32-year-old white male approximately 5'10 weighing approximately 154lbs," police posted on Facebook.</p>

<p>Agents, from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives have been called in to assist the Kentucky State Police and local law enforcement, the agency posted on X, calling it a "critical incident."</p>

<p>London is a small city of about 8,000 residents near the Daniel Boone National Forest, about 90 miles south of Lexington.</p>

<p>The shooting comes days after two students and two teachers were killed, and nine others wounded, at a high school in Winder, Georgia high school. A 14-year-old student and his father, suspected of giving his son access to the gun used in the shooting, were charged in the shootings, which took place soon after the school year opened.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said on Saturday Islamic countries should form an alliance against what he called "the growing threat of expansionism" from Israel, drawing a rebuke from the Israeli foreign minister.</p>

<p>He made the comment after describing what Palestinian and Turkish officials said was the killing by Israeli troops of a Turkish-American woman taking part in a protest on Friday against settlement expansion in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.</p>

<p>"The only step that will stop Israeli arrogance, Israeli banditry, and Israeli state terrorism is the alliance of Islamic countries," Erdogan said at an Islamic schools' association event near Istanbul.</p>

<p>He said recent steps that Turkey has taken to improve ties with Egypt and Syria are aimed at "forming a line of solidarity against the growing threat of expansionism," which he said also threatened Lebanon and Syria.</p>

<p>Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz said in a statement that Erdogan's remark was "a dangerous lie and incitement," and that the Turkish leader has been working for years with Iran to undermine the region's moderate Arab regimes.</p>

<p>Erdogan hosted Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi in Ankara this week and they discussed the Gaza war and ways to further repair their long-frozen ties during what was the first such presidential visit in 12 years.</p>

<p>Ties between them started thawing in 2020 when Turkey began diplomatic efforts to ease tensions with estranged regional rivals, including the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia.</p>

<p>Erdogan said in July that Turkey would extend an invitation to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad "any time" for possible talks to restore relations between the two neighbours, who severed ties in 2011 after the outbreak of the Syrian civil war.</p>

<p>Israel's military said after Friday's incident that it was looking into reports that a female foreign national "was killed as a result of shots fired in the area. The details of the incident and the circumstances in which she was hit are under review."</p>

<p>There was no immediate comment on Friday's incident from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>"These will be uncrewed to test the reliability of landing intact on Mars," Musk said, adding if those landings go well, his space company will launch its first crewed flights to Mars in four years.</p>

<p>"Flight rate will grow exponentially from there, with the goal of building a self-sustaining city in about 20 years," the billionaire said.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russian shelling killed five people in Donetsk region in eastern Ukraine on Saturday, officials said.</p>

<p>Three people were killed and four injured in the town of Kostyantynivka, Donetsk region governor Vadym Filashkin said, while two men in their 50s were reported killed in shelling near the town of Toretsk about 20 km (12 miles) to the southeast.</p>

<p>Filashkin said in a post on the Telegram social media channel that three men aged between 24 and 69 were killed and a multi-storey block, administrative building and shop were damaged in the attack on Kostyantynivka.</p>

<p>Three others were lightly wounded and received medical treatment, he said. Suspilne public broadcaster quoted Anastasiia Medvedeva, a spokesperson for Donetsk prosecutor's office, as saying the fourth injured person was a 57-year-old woman who suffered a shrapnel wound and a head injury.</p>

<p>In separate shelling, Suspilne quoted Medvedeva as saying a man aged 52 and a man aged 53 were killed just outside Toretsk, a focus of recent Russian offences also in Donetsk region.</p>

<p>Kostyantynivka, which before the war was an industrial town of around 70,000 people, has seen many of its residents leave as the frontline has moved closer through the 30-month Russian invasion. It has been hit regularly by missiles, bombs and artillery.</p>

<p>In August, authorities announced a compulsory evacuation of families with children from the city due to the danger posed by Russia's advances.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump delivered a dark speech to a rally Saturday in the US swing state of Wisconsin, while Democrat Kamala Harris hunkered down in another crucial battleground, Pennsylvania, preparing for next week's televised presidential debate.</p>

<p>Trump and Harris are now essentially tied in the polls, with the Republican again shrugging off a mountain of scandals that would have sunk candidates of the past.</p>

<p>At the rally in Mosinee, Wisconsin, the former president delivered his characteristic stream of insults, exaggerations and outright falsehoods, painting a picture of an apocalyptic America run by a leftist dictatorship -- a "rogue regime."</p>

<p>Under President Joe Biden and Vice President Harris, "your government imported murderers, child predators and serial rapists from all over the planet, while weaponizing law enforcement to jail political opponents," Trump told several thousand supporters at an airport in the heartland of Trump's mostly white, conservative base.</p>

<p>"With your vote this election, their lying, cheating, thieving, hoaxing and plotting will come to an end."</p>

<p>He denounced the string of criminal cases he faces over everything from attempting to overthrow his 2020 election loss to Biden, to dozens of felony fraud convictions in New York.</p>

<p>Harris, taking a break from days of debate preparation in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, visited a spice store where she drew a contrast to Trump's grim tone.</p>

<p>Asked what message she would most like to get across in their debate Tuesday, she replied: "It's time to turn the page on the divisiveness. It's time to bring our country together -- chart a new way forward."</p>

<p>Harris said she was "honored" by the recent endorsements of two prominent conservatives, former vice president Dick Cheney and his daughter, former representative Liz Cheney, adding, "It's important to put country above party."</p>

<p>Asked if she was ready to face Trump, Harris said simply, "Yes, I am."</p>

<p>Crowds outside cheered as she left the shop, and the Harris campaign released video of the vice president hugging emotional supporters there, including a young girl.</p>

<h3><strong>Police union for Trump</strong></h3>

<p>Trump got a boost Friday when the country's largest police union, the Fraternal Order of Police, endorsed him despite his historic status as a convicted felon.</p>

<p>And he enjoyed a legal victory earlier in the day when a New York judge delayed his sentencing for hush money paid to a porn star until after the November election.</p>

<p>Trump also appeared before reporters to rail against the women who have accused him of sexual impropriety.</p>

<p>Harris, a former California prosecutor, is leaning heavily on her message that she represents law and order in a contest against a convicted criminal who tried to overturn his 2020 election loss -- another unprecedented element in a political season that has the country on edge.</p>

<h3><strong>Harris's policies</strong></h3>

<p>The vice president jumped into the 2024 race at the last minute after Biden abruptly dropped out on July 21, amid fears over his stamina and mental acuity.</p>

<p>Despite a burst of initial enthusiasm from Democrats, Harris has had to race to introduce and define herself.</p>

<p>The debate on Tuesday offers her a prime opportunity to present clear policy proposals -- she has been criticized for a lack of detail -- while sharpening her attack lines against Trump.</p>

<p>The former president, perhaps seeking to set expectations for the debate, said Saturday that the "crooked system" would not acknowledge if he won on Tuesday.</p>

<p>"They'll say, 'Trump suffered a humiliating defeat'," he asserted.</p>

<p>Pennsylvania, where Harris is preparing, is closely divided between Republican and Democratic voters, and may be the deciding piece in the puzzle of the state-by-state Electoral College battle that decides US presidential elections.</p>

<p>The debate will be the first-ever meeting between Harris and Trump. He refused to attend Biden's inauguration -- he would have met her there -- after falsely claiming the 2020 election was stolen from him.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Paris court in May detained and charged a couple on accusations that they were involved in Iranian plots to kill Jews in Germany and France, police sources told AFP.</p>

<p>Authorities charged Abdelkrim S., 34, and his partner Sabrina B., 33, on May 4 with conspiring with a criminal terrorist organisation and placed them in pre-trial detention.</p>

<p>The case, known as "Marco Polo" and revealed Thursday by French news website Mediapart, signals a revival in Iranian state-sponsored terrorism in Europe, according to a report by France's General Directorate for Internal Security (DGSI) consulted by AFP.</p>

<p>"Since 2015, the Iranian (secret) services have resumed a targeted killing policy," the French security agency wrote, adding that "the threat has worsened again in the context of the Israel-Hamas war".</p>

<p>The alleged objective for Iranian intelligence was to target civilians and sow fear in Europe among the country's political opposition as well as among Jews and Israelis.</p>

<p>Iran is accused of recruiting criminals, including drug lords, to conduct such operations.</p>

<p>Abdelkrim S. was previously sentenced to 10 years behind bars over a killing in Marseille and released on probation in July 2023.</p>

<p>He is accused of being the main France-based operative for an Iran-sponsored terrorist cell that planned acts of violence in France and Germany.</p>

<p>A former fellow inmate is believed to have connected the suspect with the cell's coordinator, a major drug trafficker from the Lyon area who likely visited Iran in May, according to the DGSI.</p>

<p>The group intended to attack a Paris-based former employee at an Israeli security firm and three of his colleagues residing in the Paris suburbs.</p>

<p>Three Israeli-German citizens in Munich and Berlin were also among the targets.</p>

<p>Investigators believe that Abdelkrim S. despite his probation made multiple trips to Germany for scouting purposes, including travels to Berlin with his wife.</p>

<p>He denied the accusations and said he simply had purchases to make.</p>

<p>French authorities are also crediting the cell with plots to set fire to four Israeli-owned companies in the south of France between late December 2023 and early January 2024, said a police source.</p>

<p>Abdelkrim S. while in detention rejected the claims, the source added, saying he had acted as a go-between on Telegram for the mastermind and other individuals involved in a planned insurance scam.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A bomb threat, which caused a flight operated by India's Vistara Airlines to make an emergency landing in Erzurum, eastern Turkey two days ago has turned out to be false, according to the local governor.</p>

<p>"We have concluded all search and examination activities and have determined that the bomb threat was unfounded," Erzurum Governor Mustafa Ciftci told reporters on Saturday.</p>

<p>As a result, the flight ban at Erzurum's airport has been lifted, he said, noting that an alternate flight from Mumbai, India, has been arranged for the stranded passengers to continue their journey, Xinhua news agency reported.</p>

<p>A Vistara spokesperson had said flight UK27 from Mumbai to Frankfurt diverted due to "a security concern". The flight landed at Erzurum at 4.30 p.m. local time.</p>

<p>"As of 23:30, we have completed all search and examination operations. As a result of the work we carried out, we found that the bomb threat was unfounded," Ciftci told reporters at the airport.</p>

<p>"All flights coming or leaving from our province will now be able to fly comfortably," he said.</p>

<p>Vistara said in a post on X that customers, crew and the aircraft were cleared by security agencies and that all necessary checks were conducted.</p>

<p>The airline also said it was sending an alternate aircraft to Turkey by 12:25 p.m. local time on Saturday to take the passengers to Frankfurt.</p>

<p>The plane en route from Mumbai to Frankfurt made an emergency landing in eastern Turkey on Friday following a bomb threat.</p>

<p>Turkish authorities said a note reading "bomb on board" was discovered in a lavatory on the aircraft, prompting the plane, with 247 passengers and crew on board, to make an emergency landing.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[More than 100,000 left-wing demonstrators rallied across France on Saturday to protest against the nomination of the centre-right Michel Barnier as prime minister and denounce President Emmanuel Macron's "power grab".]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>More than 100,000 left-wing demonstrators rallied across France on Saturday to protest against the nomination of the centre-right Michel Barnier as prime minister and denounce President Emmanuel Macron's "power grab".</p>

<p>The interior ministry said 110,000 people took to the streets nationwide, including 26,000 in Paris, while one leading left-winger put the turnout across France at 300,000.</p>

<p>Rallies took place in cities across France including Nantes in the west, Nice and Marseille in the south and Strasbourg in the east.</p>

<p>Macron on Thursday appointed Barnier, a 73-year-old former foreign minister who acted as the European Union's Brexit negotiator, as prime minister, seeking to move forward after snap elections in which his centrist alliance came second.</p>

<p>Barnier said on Friday that he was open to naming ministers of all political stripes, including "people from the left".</p>

<p>But a left-wing coalition, which emerged as France's largest political bloc after the June-July elections, although short of an overall majority, has denounced Macron's appointment of Barnier.</p>

<p>The alliance wanted Lucie Castets, a 37-year-old economist, to become prime minister, but Macron quashed that idea, arguing that she would not survive a confidence vote in the hung parliament.</p>

<p>On Saturday, many demonstrators directed their anger at Macron, 46, and some called on him to resign.</p>

<h3><strong>'Old elephant'</strong></h3>

<p>"The Fifth Republic is collapsing," said 21-year-old protester Manon Bonijol, referring to France's current system of government.</p>

<p>"Expressing one's vote will be useless as long as Macron is in power," she added.</p>

<p>Hard-left leader Jean-Luc Melenchon, whose France Unbowed party (LFI) and allies belong to the left-wing bloc, had called for people to take to the streets, arguing that the election had been "stolen from the French".</p>

<p>On Saturday, he urged supporters to prepare for battle.</p>

<p>"There will be no pause," he vowed.</p>

<p>"Democracy isn't just the art of accepting that you've won, it's also the humility of accepting that you've lost," Melenchon said at the Paris march.</p>

<p>Project manager Alexandra Germain, 44, accused Macron of riding roughshod over the wishes of voters.</p>

<p>"Demonstrating is my only way of saying that I don't agree, even if I am well aware that it is useless," said Germain.</p>

<p>Abel Couaillier, a 20-year-old student, said he was stunned by the appointment of Barnier whom he called an "old elephant".</p>

<p>"I am still young, I want to believe that we can change things," added Couaillier.</p>

<p>Leading LFI figure Mathilde Panot claimed on X, formerly Twitter, that 160,000 demonstrators had protested in Paris and 300,000 people across France.</p>

<p>Police said five people had been detained in Paris.</p>

<h3><strong>&nbsp;'Under surveillance'</strong></h3>

<p>Marine Le Pen, who leads far-right National Rally (RN) lawmakers in parliament, has said her party will not be part of the new cabinet, and that she will wait for Barnier's first policy speech in parliament before deciding whether or not to back him.</p>

<p>"Barnier is a prime minister under surveillance," said RN party president Jordan Bardella on Saturday.</p>

<p>"I am under the surveillance of all French people," said Barnier, on the sidelines of a visit to the Necker children's hospital in Paris.</p>

<p>Barnier will be in charge of the budget, security, immigration and healthcare.</p>

<p>He will have to take into account the interests of the National Rally -- the single-largest party in a fragmented legislature -- if he wants to avoid a motion of no-confidence in parliament.</p>

<p>Barnier -- who is likely to have only minority support in the National Assembly -- faces the urgent task of presenting the 2025 budget by early October.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hezbollah announced retaliatory rocket fire targeting a town in northern Israel early Sunday, hours after Lebanon's health ministry said an Israeli attack killed three civil defence personnel in the country's south.</p>

<p>The Iran-backed Lebanese movement has exchanged near-daily cross-border fire with Israeli forces in support of ally Hamas since the Palestinian militant group's October 7 attack on Israel triggered the war in the Gaza Strip.</p>

<p>Hezbollah said it had bombarded "Kiryat Shmona with a volley of Falaq rockets" early Sunday "in response to the enemy attacks... and particularly the attack" that killed the emergency workers in the Lebanese village of Froun.</p>

<p>Hezbollah usually says it targets military positions in northern Israel, while Israel has said it targets Hezbollah infrastructure and fighters in south and east Lebanon.</p>

<p>On Saturday, Lebanon's health ministry said the "Israeli enemy targeting of a Lebanese civil defence team that was putting out fires sparked by the recent Israeli strikes in the village of Froun led to the martyrdom of three emergency responders".</p>

<p>Two others were wounded, one of them critically, the ministry added.</p>

<p>Lebanon's civil defence said in a statement that three of its employees were killed in "an Israeli strike that targeted a firefighting vehicle after they had finished a firefighting mission".</p>

<p>The health ministry statement condemned the "blatant Israeli attack that targeted a team from an official body of the Lebanese state".</p>

<p>Hezbollah ally the Amal movement said two of its members were among the dead in Saturday's strike. It said they were killed "while carrying out their humanitarian and national duty defending Lebanon and the south".</p>

<p>Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati condemned the attack on the emergency workers, saying in a statement that "this new aggression against Lebanon is a blatant violation of international laws... and human values".</p>

<h3><strong>'Repeated, deliberate'</strong></h3>

<p>Lebanon's health ministry said the attack was "the second of its kind against an emergency team in less than 12 hours".</p>

<p>Earlier Saturday, the ministry said two emergency personnel from the Hezbollah-affiliated Islamic Health Committee were wounded when "the Israeli enemy deliberately targeted" near a fire they were heading to extinguish in south Lebanon's Qabrikha, causing their vehicle to swerve.</p>

<p>Several militant groups operate health centres and emergency response operations in south Lebanon.</p>

<p>Hezbollah had announced a string of attacks on Israeli troops and positions near the border on Saturday, including with Katyusha rockets and "explosives-laden drones", some in a stated response to "Israeli enemy attacks" on south Lebanon.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said Saturday that it had identified "projectiles" crossing from Lebanon and intercepting some of them, adding "a number of UAVs (drones) were identified crossing from Lebanese territory".</p>

<p>It said the air force struck "Hezbollah military infrastructure and a launcher" in the Qabrikha area, while its artillery targeted several other areas of south Lebanon.</p>

<p>The cross-border violence has killed some 614 people in Lebanon, mostly fighters but also including 138 civilians, according to an AFP tally.</p>

<p>On the Israeli side, including in the annexed Golan Heights, authorities have announced the deaths of at least 24 soldiers and 26 civilians.</p>

<p>A statement from Lebanese Health Minister Firass Abiad said that "due to the (Israeli) aggression", 27 emergency personnel and health workers have been killed and 94 others wounded since October.</p>

<p>Two hospitals and 21 health centres have been "targeted", while 32 fire or ambulance vehicles have been "put out of service or partially damaged", the statement said, urging an end to the "repeated and deliberate targeting of health workers and civilians".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>El Nino and La Nina are climate patterns in the Pacific Ocean that can affect weather worldwide.</p>

<p>Earlier on April 26, at least 155 people have lost their lives as a result of flooding and landslides caused by heavy rains in Tanzania, according to Al Jazeera.</p>

<p>In an address at the Parliament on Thursday, Prime Minister Kassim Majaliwa said that the current rainy season has been made worse by the El Nino climate pattern, which has resulted in flooding and the destruction of roads, bridges, and railroads.</p>

<p>"The heavy El Nino rains, accompanied by strong winds, floods and landslides in various parts of the country, have caused significant damage," Majaliwa said.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>British tech tycoon Mike Lynch died of suffocation after running out of oxygen, an investigative source said, citing initial examinations carried out on Saturday after his body was recovered from the family yacht that sank off Sicily's coast last month.</p>

<p>Lynch, his daughter Hannah, 18, an onboard cook and four guests died when the British-flagged superyacht Bayesian sank during a severe and sudden weather event off the port of Porticello, near Palermo, on Aug. 19.</p>

<p>Initial results on Hannah Lynch's body, whose examinations were carried out on Saturday, were inconclusive, the source told Reuters, only ruling out any traumas or wounds as the cause of death and leaving open the possibilities she either ran out of oxygen or drowned.</p>

<p>The bodies of the dead, except for the cook, were found in cabins on the left-hand side of the 56-metre (184-feet) vessel, where the trapped passengers may have tried to search for remaining bubbles of air, the head of Palermo's Fire Brigade said last month.</p>

<p>Preliminary results from autopsies on four other victims - Morgan Stanley International Chairman Jonathan Bloomer, his wife Judith, lawyer Chris Morvillo and his wife Neda - indicated suffocation as the likely cause of death, judicial sources said earlier this week.</p>

<p>Fifteen people survived, including Lynch's wife, whose company owned the Bayesian, and the yacht's captain.</p>

<p>Initial examinations of the Canadian-Antiguan onboard chef Recaldo Thomas indicated he died by drowning, the investigative source said on Saturday.</p>

<p>Further forensic tests have been ordered all the victims, with results expected in the coming weeks, the source said.</p>

<p>The sinking has puzzled naval experts, who said a vessel like the Bayesian, built by high-end yacht manufacturer Perini, which is owned by The Italian Sea Group, should have withstood the storm and not have sunk as quickly as it did.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza entered its 12th month Saturday with little sign of respite for the Palestinian territory or hope for Israeli hostages still held captive.</p>

<p>The chances of a truce that would also swap Palestinian prisoners jailed by Israel for hostages held by Hamas appeared slim, with both sides sticking doggedly to their positions.</p>

<p>Hamas, whose October 7 attack on Israel sparked the war, is demanding a complete Israeli withdrawal, but Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu insists troops must remain along the Gaza-Egypt border.</p>

<p>The United States, Qatar and Egypt have all been mediating in an effort to bring about a ceasefire in the war that authorities in the Hamas-run Gaza say has killed at least 40,939 people.</p>

<p>According to the United Nations human rights office, most of the dead are women and children.</p>

<p>Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,205 people, mostly civilians including some hostages killed in captivity, according to official Israeli figures.</p>

<p>Of 251 hostages seized by Palestinian Hamas operatives during the attack, 97 remain in Gaza including 33 the Israeli military says are dead.</p>

<p>Scores were released during a one-week truce in November.</p>

<p>Israel's announcement last Sunday that the bodies of six hostages including a US-Israeli citizen had been recovered shortly after being killed sparked grief and anger in Israel.</p>

<p>Marking the anniversary, UN Palestinian refugee agency (UNRWA) chief Philippe Lazzarini posted on X on Saturday: "Eleven months. Enough. No one can take this any longer. Humanity must prevail. Ceasefire now."</p>

<p><strong>American activist killed</strong></p>

<p>International pressure to end the war was further underlined by Friday's shooting dead in the occupied West Bank of Turkish-American activist Aysenur Ezgi Eygi demonstrating against Israeli settlements in the occupied territory.</p>

<p>Eygi's family demanded an independent investigation into her death, saying her life "was taken needlessly, unlawfully, and violently by the Israeli military".</p>

<p>The UN rights office said Israeli forces killed Eygi, 26, with a "shot in the head".</p>

<p>Turkey said she was killed by "Israeli occupation soldiers" while the United States called her death "tragic" and pressed Israel to investigate.</p>

<p>Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan denounced Israel as a "barbaric" state and urged Muslim nations to confront it saying: "It is an Islamic duty for us to stand against Israel's state terror. It is a religious duty."</p>

<p>Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz responded saying that Erdogan "continues to throw the Turkish people into the fire of hatred and violence for the sake of his Hamas friends".</p>

<p>Around 490,000 people live in Israeli settlements -- illegal under international law -- in the West Bank which Israel occupied in 1967, illegal under international law.</p>

<p>Since Hamas's October 7 attack, Israeli troops or settlers have killed more than at least 662 Palestinians in the West Bank, according to the Palestinian health ministry.</p>

<p>Israel says at least 23 Israelis, including members of the security forces, were killed during the same period in Palestinian attacks.</p>

<p>Eygi's death came on the day Israeli forces withdrew from a deadly 10-day raid in the West Bank city of Jenin, where AFP journalists reported residents returning home to widespread destruction.</p>

<p>The pullout came with Israel at loggerheads with the United States over talks to forge a truce in the Gaza war.</p>

<p>US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said "90 percent is agreed" and urged Israel and Hamas to finalise a deal. Netanyahu denied this, telling Fox News: "It's not close."</p>

<p>Hamas is demanding Israel's complete withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, saying it agreed months ago to a proposal outlined by US President Joe Biden.</p>

<p><strong>Fresh violence</strong></p>

<p>AFP reporters said air strikes and shelling rocked Gaza on Saturday, killing at least 17 people according to civil defence officials, the Palestinian Red Crescent and witnesses.</p>

<p>Among those who died were a woman and a child in an air strike north of Gaza City, while four people were killed in another strike targeting a flat in Bureij camp.</p>

<p>In the Sheikh Radwan neighbourhood of Gaza City, the civil defence said an Israeli strike on a school-turned-shelter for displaced people killed at least three people and wounded more than 20.</p>

<p>Israel and Lebanon's Hezbollah movement, a Hamas ally, also exchanged fire.</p>

<p>Hezbollah said it targeted two Israeli bases with Katyusha rockets. Lebanon's National News Agency said Israel carried out air strikes and shelling of several areas of the country's south.</p>

<p>Israel's army said it intercepted missiles detected crossing from Lebanon and struck a Hezbollah launch site in the south Lebanon.</p>

<p>Lebanon's health ministry said three emergency personnel were killed and two others wounded in an Israeli attack on a civil defence team putting out fires in south Lebanon.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli military strikes across the Palestinian Gaza Strip killed at least 61 people in the space of 48 hours, local medics said on Saturday, as Israeli forces battled Hamas operatives in the territory.</p>

<p>Eleven months into the war, numerous rounds of diplomacy have so far failed to clinch a ceasefire deal to end the conflict and bring the release of Israeli and foreign hostages held in Gaza as well as many Palestinians jailed in Israel.</p>

<p>An Israeli airstrike in on the Halima al-Sa'diyya school compound serving as a shelter for displaced people in the Jabalia urban refugee camp killed at least eight people and wounded 15 others, medics said.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said the strike had targeted a Hamas command centre inside the compound. It accused the Hamas group of repeatedly exploiting civilians and civilian infrastructure for military purposes, an allegation Hamas denies.</p>

<p>Five more people were killed in a strike on a house in Gaza City.</p>

<p>Later on Saturday, an Israeli strike killed four people and wounded 25 others at Amr Ibn Ala'as school, which also houses displaced families in the Sheikh Radwan suburb of Gaza City, Palestinian medics said.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said the air strike targeted a command center operated by Hamas gunmen in the compound that had previously served as a school.</p>

<p>Palestinian health officials said Israeli military strikes had killed so far 28 people across the Gaza Strip on Saturday.</p>

<p>The armed wings of the Hamas, Islamic Jihad and Fatah groups said they had fought Israeli troops in Gaza City, in central areas and in the south with anti-tank rockets and mortar bombs, and in some incidents detonated bombs to target tanks and other army vehicles.</p>

<p>The two warring sides continued to blame one another for the failure of mediators, including Qatar, Egypt and the United States, to broker a ceasefire. The U.S. is preparing to present a new proposal, but the prospects of a breakthrough appear dim as gaps between the sides remain large.</p>

<p>CIA Director William Burns, the chief U.S. negotiator, told an event in London that a more detailed proposal would be made in the coming days.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>PAUSES IN FIGHTING LET POLIO VACCINATIONS CONTINUE</strong></p>

<p>On Thursday, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said it was incumbent on both Israel and Hamas, which ran Gaza before the war and was responsible for the Oct. 7 killing spree against Jews in Israel that triggered it, to make concessions to reach a deal.</p>

<p>On Saturday, senior Hamas official Hossam Badran said the group had made no new demands and remained committed to a July 2 proposal put forward by the United States, accusing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of attaching new conditions that would not end the war.</p>

<p>Netanyahu says it was Hamas that introduced unacceptable conditions.</p>

<p>Despite the deadlock, the United Nations, in collaboration with local health authorities, has pursued a campaign to vaccinate 640,000 children in Gaza after its first polio case in around 25 years. Limited pauses in the fighting have allowed the campaign to proceed.</p>

<p>U.N. officials said they were making progress, having reached over half of the children needing the drops in the first two stages in the southern and central Gaza Strip.</p>

<p>On Sunday, the campaign will move to the northern Gaza Strip. A second round of vaccination will be required four weeks after the first.</p>

<p>The latest bloodshed in the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict was triggered on Oct. 7 when group Hamas attacked Israel, killing 1,200 and taking about 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.</p>

<p>Israel's subsequent assault on the enclave has killed over 40,900 Palestinians, according to the local health ministry, while also displacing nearly the entire population of 2.3 million, causing a hunger crisis and leading to genocide allegations at the World Court, which Israel denies.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 20-year-old Pakistani citizen, residing in Canada, has been arrested and charged by the US for planning a terror attack targeting Jews in New York City around the October 7 anniversary of Hamas' attack on Israel.</p>

<p>Khan, or Shahzeb Jadoon, planned a terrorist attack in New York City (NYC) around October 7 with the "goal of slaughtering, in the name of the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS), as many Jewish people as possible," Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement on Friday.</p>

<p>Identified as an ISIS supporter, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/pakistan-national-arrested-from-canada-for-plotting-isis-terrorist-attack-in-new-york-city-on-israel-hamas-attack-anniversary-6509164">Muhammad Shahzeb Khan was arrested</a> on Wednesday in Ormstown town, about 60 km south of Montreal in Canada, and approximately 20 km from the US-Canada border. He also faces three charges in Canada.</p>

<p>He was arrested in connection with a complaint filed in the Southern District of New York for attempting to provide material support and resources to ISIS.</p>

<p>If convicted, Khan faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.</p>

<p>Hamas based in the Gaza Strip launched an unprecedented attack on Israel by land, air and sea on October 7, 2023.</p>

<p>As per Khan's preparation in connection with the planned attack, Khan attempted to reach the US-Canada border. He used three separate cars to travel across Canada towards the US before being stopped near Ormstown.</p>

<p>Thanks to the investigative work of the American agency, "and the quick action of our Canadian law enforcement partners, the defendant was taken into custody", said Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC News) and added that Khan now faces three charges in Canada.</p>

<p>The charges are, 'Attempting to leave Canada to commit an offence for a terrorist group', 'Participating in the activities of a terrorist group', and 'Conspiracy to commit an offence by violating US immigration law - entering or attempting to enter the US unlawfully', it added.</p>

<p>According to the complaint filed in New York, Khan attempted to travel from Canada to New York City, where he intended to use automatic and semi-automatic weapons to carry out a mass shooting in support of the IS at a Jewish centre in Brooklyn, New York.</p>

<p>Khan began posting on social media and communicating with others on an encrypted messaging application about his support for the IS in or about November last year when, among other things, Khan distributed IS propaganda videos and literature.</p>

<p>"If we succeed with our plan, this would be the largest attack on US soil since 9/11," he said in one of the messages.</p>

<p>Khan began communicating with two undercover law enforcement officers, the statement said, adding, during those conversations, Khan confirmed that he and a US-based IS supporter, identified only as Associate-1 in the complaint, had been planning to carry out an attack in a particular US city, identified as 'City-1.' Among other things, Khan said that he had been actively attempting to create "a real offline cell" of IS supporters to carry out a "coordinated assault" in the city using AR-style rifles to "target Israeli Jewish Chabad... scattered all around" (the city).</p>

<p>During subsequent conversations, Khan repeatedly instructed the undercover officers to obtain AR-style assault rifles, ammunition, and other materials to carry out the attacks and identified the specific locations in the city where the attacks would take place, the complaint said.</p>

<p>Khan also provided details about how he would cross the border from Canada into the US for the attacks.</p>

<p>During these conversations with the undercover officers, Khan emphasised that "October 7 and Oct 11 are the best days for targeting the Jews" stating the community will surely hold some protest demonstrations on the first anniversary and October 11 is 'Yom Kippur,' an important Jewish festival.</p>

<p>Around August 20, Khan changed his target location from City-1 to New York City and decided to target a Jewish centre in Brooklyn. In support of his choice, Khan also boasted that "New York is perfect to target Jews" because it has the "largest Jewish population in America" and therefore, "even if we don't attack a[n] Event[,] we could easily rack up a lot of Jews".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The shocking find was made by a woman who had spent decades searching for her twin brothers who passed away in 1962.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A shocking discovery has been made in a British cemetery. In Royton Cemetery in Oldham, a mass grave containing more than 300 bodies-mostly those of stillborn babies and small children-has been discovered, according to <em>The Metro.</em> The remains of 145 stillborn infants, 128 babies and young children, and 29 adults were discovered within the 12-by-12-foot burial. These people's remains have been buried at the unmarked burial site for a long time.</p>

<p>The person who discovered them was a woman who had spent decades trying to find the graves of her twin brothers, who had passed away in 1962. While the other twin died soon after birth, the first twin was stillborn. After searching, the woman found the mass burial.</p>

<p>"I live near the cemetery, and I used to walk through it with my mother all the time, and we had no idea they were buried there," she told the MailOnline. "I get upset speaking about it because my mother died and is buried in the same cemetery, but she never knew they were there."</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://metro.co.uk/2024/09/06/bodies-babies-children-found-mass-grave-21558406/"><em>The Metro,</em></a> up until the 1980s, parents of stillborn children were kept in the dark by doctors over the fate of their lost children-many were taken away without the parents ever knowing where they were buried, typically in mass graves. Bereaved parents were instead told their child was buried alongside a 'nice person' that same day.</p>

<p>"My brothers were only a year older, and I have one younger brother, but I saw growing up how the grief affected my parents without any support," Sarah said.</p>

<p>The boys weren't on any official records, so Sarah spent years in a 'merry-go-round' of genealogy companies, council officials, and coroners to find them.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Asia's most powerful storm this year made landfall in northern Vietnam on Saturday, the meteorological agency said, killing at least four people after tearing through China's island of Hainan and the Philippines.</p>

<p>Super Typhoon Yagi hit island districts of north Vietnam around 1 p.m. (0600 GMT), generating winds of up to 160 kph (99 mph) near its centre, having lost power from its peak of 234 kph (145 mph) in Hainan a day earlier.</p>

<p>The government said that as of 5 p.m. four people had died and 78 had been injured by the typhoon. At least another dozen were missing at sea, according to state media.</p>

<p>Yagi had already claimed the lives of at least two people in Hainan and 16 people in the Philippines, the first country it hit, having formed east of the archipelago earlier in the week.</p>

<p>Vietnam's coastal city of Haiphong, an industrial hub with a population of 2 million people that hosts factories from foreign multinationals and local carmaker VinFast, was among the hardest-hit by winds with speeds of up to 90 kph.</p>

<p>As the typhoon approached, the city experienced widespread power outages on Saturday, authorities said, as did at least three other northern provinces.</p>

<p>In Haiphong, the strong winds smashed windows and waves were as much as three meters high when they hit the coast, according to a Reuters witness.</p>

<p>Metal roofing sheets were blown away, pictures and footage on local media showed. The government said thousands of trees had fallen and many houses were damaged across northern Vietnam.</p>

<p>Earlier in Hainan, which has a population of more than 10 million, the storm felled trees, flooded roads and cut power to more than 800,000 homes.</p>

<p><strong>AIRPORTS CLOSED</strong></p>

<p>Vietnam evacuated more than 50,000 people from coastal towns and deployed 450,000 military personnel, the government said.</p>

<p>It also suspended operations for several hours at four airports on Saturday, including Hanoi's Noi Bai, the busiest in the north, which cancelled more than 300 flights.</p>

<p>High schools were also closed in 12 northern provinces, including in the capital Hanoi, which has a population of 8.5 million.</p>

<p>Authorities in the capital suspended public transport on buses and its two elevated metro lines on Saturday afternoon, state media reported. The meteorological agency has warned of risks of heavy flooding in the city centre.</p>

<p>Hanoi resident Nguyen Manh Quan, 40, said: "The wind is strong enough to blow a person over," while Dang Van Phuong, also 40, said: "I've never seen a storm like this, you can't drive in these winds."</p>

<p>Typhoons are becoming stronger, fuelled by warmer oceans, amid climate change, scientists say.</p>

<p>Last week, Typhoon Shanshan slammed into southwestern Japan, the strongest storm to hit the country in decades.</p>

<p>Yagi is named after the Japanese word for goat and the constellation of Capricornus.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

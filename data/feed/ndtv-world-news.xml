       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Simon Boas, who wrote a candid account of living with cancer, passed away on July 15 at the age of 47. In a recent <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/clmykzrdnljo">BBC interview</a>, the former aid worker told the reporter: “My pain is under control and I'm terribly happy – it sounds weird to say, but I'm as happy as I've ever been in my life.”</p>

<p>It may seem odd that a person could be happy as the end draws near, but in my experience as a clinical psychologist working with people at the end of their lives, it's not that uncommon.</p>

<p>There is quite a lot of research suggesting that fear of death is at the unconscious centre of being human. William James, an American philosopher, called the knowledge that we must die <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/170217/the-worm-at-the-core-by-sheldon-solomon-jeff-greenberg-and-tom-pyszczynski/">“the worm at the core”</a> of the human condition.</p>

<p>But a <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/44577785">study</a> in Psychological Science shows that people nearing death use more positive language to describe their experience than those who just imagine death. This suggests that the experience of dying is more pleasant – or, at least, less unpleasant – than we might picture it.</p>

<p>In the BBC interview, Boas shared some of the insights that helped him come to accept his situation. He mentioned the importance of enjoying life and prioritising meaningful experiences, suggesting that acknowledging death can enhance our appreciation for life.</p>

<p>Despite the pain and difficulties, Boas seemed cheerful, hoping his attitude would support his wife and parents during the difficult times ahead.</p>

<p>Boas's words echo the Roman philosopher Seneca who <a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Moral_letters_to_Lucilius/Letter_61">advised that</a>: “To have lived long enough depends neither upon our years nor upon our days, but upon our minds.”</p>

<p>A more recent thinker expressing similar sentiments is the psychiatrist <a href="https://www.viktorfrankl.org/">Viktor Frankl</a> who, after surviving Auschwitz, wrote <a href="https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/347571/mans-search-for-meaning-by-viktor-e-frankl/9781846046384">Man's Search for Meaning</a> (1946) in which he lay the groundwork for a form of existential psychotherapy, with the focus of discovering meaning in any kind of circumstance. Its most recent adaptation is meaning-centred psychotherapy, which offers people with cancer a way to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4861219/">improve their sense of meaning</a>.</p>

<h2>How happiness and meaning relate</h2>

<p>In two recent studies, in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/S1478951521000262">Palliative and Supportive Care</a> and the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/1049909120939857">American Journal of Hospice and Palliative Care</a>, people approaching death were asked what constitutes happiness for them. Common themes in both studies were social connections, enjoying simple pleasures such as being in nature, having a positive mindset and a general shift in focus from seeking pleasure to finding meaning and fulfilment as their illness progressed.</p>

<p>In my work as a clinical psychologist, I sometimes meet people who have – or eventually arrive at – a similar outlook on life as Boas. One person especially comes to mind – let's call him Johan.</p>

<p>The first time I met Johan, he came to the clinic by himself, with a slight limp. We talked about life, about interests, relationships and meaning. Johan appeared to be lucid, clear and articulate.</p>

<p>The second time, he came with crutches. One foot had begun to lag and he couldn't trust his balance. He said it was frustrating to lose control of his foot, but still hoped to cycle around Mont Blanc.</p>

<p>When I asked him what his concerns were, he burst into tears. He said: “That I won't get to celebrate my birthday next month.” We sat quietly for a while and took in the situation. It wasn't the moment of death itself that weighed on him the most, it was all the things he wouldn't be able to do again.</p>

<p>Johan arrived at our third meeting supported by a friend, no longer able to grip the crutches. He told me that he had been watching films of him cycling with his friends. He had concluded that he could watch YouTube videos of others cycling around Mont Blanc. He had even ordered a new, expensive mountain bike. “I've wanted to buy it for a long time, but was tightfisted,” he said. “I may not be able to ride it, but thought it would be cool to have in the living room.”</p>

<p>For the fourth visit, he arrived in a wheelchair. It turned out to be the last time we met. The bike had arrived; he had it next to the couch. There was one more thing he wanted to do.</p>

<p>“If by some miracle I were to get out of this alive, I would like to volunteer in domestic care services – one or two shifts a week,” Johan said. “They work hard and it gets crazy sometimes, but they make such an incredible contribution. I wouldn't have been able to get out of the apartment without them.”</p>

<p>My experience of patients with life-threatening disease is that it's possible to feel happiness alongside sadness, and other seemingly conflicting emotions. Over a day, patients can feel gratitude, remorse, longing, anger, guilt and relief – sometimes all at once. Facing the limits of existence can add perspective and help a person appreciate life more than ever.<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The UK's airports and trains experienced delays, with the London Stock Exchange and the National Health Service among the other organisations in the country dealing with the fallout of a global IT outage today that has grounded planes and caused chaos around the world.</p>

<p>The outage, believed to be related to an issue at US-headquartered prolific cybersecurity firm Crowdstrike and Microsoft, seems to be affecting Windows PCs globally and has also forced 'Sky News' off the air.</p>

<p>London's biggest airport, Heathrow, said in a statement that its "flights are operational though we are experiencing delays". While the airport said it is implementing contingency plans to minimise impact, Gatwick Airport said passengers "may experience some delays" when checking in and passing through security. Luton and Edinburgh Airport, meanwhile, switched to manual systems to support operations.</p>

<p>The London Stock Exchange Group said trading continues to operate as normal while it is working on resolving an issue with its RNS Service, which provides the Regulatory News Service announcements.</p>

<p>The IT outage, which is not believed to be linked with a malicious attack or hack, also hit several National Health Service (NHS) general practitioner (GP) surgeries around the UK as they were unable to access patient records or book online appointments.</p>

<p>NHS England said the IT outage is "causing disruption in the majority of GP practices" in England, but there is currently no known impact on its 999 or emergency services.</p>

<p>"We are unable to access driver diagrams at certain locations, leading to potential short-notice cancellations, particularly on the Thameslink and Great Northern networks," said Govia Thameslink Railway, one of the train companies impacted.</p>

<p>"Additionally, other key systems, including our real-time customer information platforms, are also affected," it added.</p>

<p>National Rail, in charge of the country's railway network, said its IT teams are "actively investigating to determine the root cause of the problem".</p>

<p>The first reports of the outage seem to have emanated from the United States late on Thursday after a breakdown of Microsoft services such as Azure and 365.</p>

<p>In a post on X, Microsoft 365 Status stated that "multiple services are continuing to see improvements in availability as our mitigation actions progress".<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A global tech outage was disrupting operations across multiple industries on Friday, with airlines halting flights, some broadcasters off air and services from banking to healthcare hit by system problems.</p>

<p>Cybersecurity firm Crowdstrike said it was working with customers impacted by a defect found in a single content update for Microsoft Windows hosts.</p>

<p>Here are some of the biggest tech outages in recent years, in chronological order:</p>

<p><strong>British Airways</strong></p>

<p>IAG-owned British Airways was hit by a major computer system failure in May 2017 that stranded 75,000 passengers over a holiday weekend, sparking a public relations disaster and pledges from the carrier that it would do better in future. According to media reports, the blackout was caused by a maintenance contractor who accidentally switched off power.</p>

<p><strong>Alphabet</strong></p>

<p>Some of Google's most popular services including YouTube, Gmail and Google Drive were down for an hour during an outage on Dec. 14, 2020. According to outage monitoring website DownDetector, more than 12,000 YouTube users were affected in various parts of the world, including the United States, Britain and India.</p>

<p><strong>Fastly</strong></p>

<p>In June 2021, thousands of government, news and social media websites across the globe were hit by a widespread hour-long outage linked to U.S.-based cloud company Fastly. The issue affected several high traffic sites including Reddit, Amazon, CNN, PayPal, Spotify, Al Jazeera Media Network and the New York Times with outages ranging from a few minutes to around an hour.</p>

<p><strong>Akamai</strong></p>

<p>Websites of dozens of financial institutions and airlines in Australia and the United States were briefly down on June 17, 2021, due to server-related glitches at content delivery network provider Akamai. According to the firm, the problem was caused by a bug in its software.</p>

<p><strong>Meta</strong></p>

<p>Meta-owned social media platforms Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram went dark for six hours on Oct. 4, 2021, with 10.6 million users reporting problems worldwide. The company said the outage was caused by a faulty configuration change.</p>

<p><strong>X Corp</strong></p>

<p>Social media platform Twitter suffered a major outage on Dec. 28, 2022, leaving tens of thousands of users globally unable to access the popular social media platform or use its key features for several hours before services appeared to come back online. Downdetector tracked more than 10,000 affected users from the United States, about 2,500 from Japan and about 2,500 from the UK at the peak of the disruption.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hours after a building near the US embassy in Tel Aviv came under attack, Israeli organisations have posted dramatic footage of a drone flying across the city's skyline and zoning in on its target.</p>

<p>The video shows the drone slicing through the Israeli commercial capital's skyline, passing very close to a skyscraper before hitting a residential building. There is an explosion followed by a fire.</p>

<p>Posting the video, the X handle of the Israeli foreign ministry said the unmanned aerial vehicle entered Israel from the West</p>

<p>"It appears that this is a Simad 3 UAV, which we estimate travelled from Yemen to Tel Aviv. The Simad 3 is an Iranian weapon system that has likely been upgraded to extend its flight range. As a result of the impact, one civilian was killed, and eight civilians were lightly injured. May the memory of the victim be a blessing and may the injured have a speedy recovery," it wrote.</p>

<p></p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">IDF: During the night, an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) entered Israel from the direction of the sea from the west, which we estimate was launched from Yemen, and hit a building in central Tel Aviv.<br />
<br />
It appears that this is a Simad 3 UAV, which we estimate traveled from Yemen to… <a href="https://t.co/6DiRAeSp4t">pic.twitter.com/6DiRAeSp4t</a></p>
— Israel Foreign Ministry (@IsraelMFA) <a href="https://twitter.com/IsraelMFA/status/1814240135812092215?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 19, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p></p>

<p>The Israel Defense Forces also posted the video and wrote that it will continue to protect Israelis against terrorism.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The drone attack, which hit a building 100 metres from the US embassy annex, has been claimed by the Houthis in Yemen.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>'Human Error'</strong></p>

<p>The Houthis fired a "new drone called 'Yafa', which is capable of bypassing the enemy's interception systems," the Iran-backed Yemeni movement's spokesman, Yahya Saree, said.</p>

<p>According to a report by news agency AFP, an Israeli military official said a "very big" drone was used in the attack on Israel's commercial capital, explaining that "human error" led to it not being intercepted.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Houthis have launched scores of drone and missile attacks on shipping vessels in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden since November in a campaign they say is an act of solidarity with Palestinians.</p>

<p>They have also repeatedly claimed to have struck Israeli cities, including Eilat, Ashdod and Haifa, in the past, but Friday's attack appears to be the first by the group to have breached Israel's intricate air defences.</p>

<p>Police said one man was found "dead in his apartment" and had suffered shrapnel wounds.</p>

<p>In recent weeks, the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, a loose alliance of Iran-backed groups, has claimed drone strikes against targets in Israel, labelling many of them "joint operations" with the Houthis.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Paris Olympics organisers said on Friday they were experiencing problems linked to a major worldwide computer systems outage, a week before the Games' opening ceremony takes place.</p>

<p>The issues came as a major outage wrought havoc on computer systems worldwide, grounding flights in the United States, derailing television broadcasts in the UK and impacting telecommunications in Australia.</p>

<p>"Paris 2024 is aware of global technical issues affecting Microsoft software. These issues are impacting Paris 2024's IT operations," organisers said.</p>

<p>"Paris 2024's technical teams have been fully mobilised to mitigate the impacts of these issues and we have activated contingency plans in order to continue operations," they added.</p>

<p>A source at the Paris Olympic Games organising committee said the problem is affecting the accreditation system with some people unable to pick up badges before next Friday's ceremony on the River Seine.</p>

<p>The source added it could also affect the arrival of athletes who have had flights cancelled after the athletes' Olympic village welcomed its first guests on Thursday.</p>

<p>The London Stock Exchange (LSE), airports in Spain, the Netherlands and Hong Kong as well as production at US carmaker Tesla's plant outside Berlin have also been disrupted.</p>

<p>Microsoft said in a statement it was taking "mitigation actions" in response to service issues.</p>

<p>It was not clear if those were linked to the global outages.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>For the 725,000 Indian immigrants living in the U.S. without a visa, the third-largest group of undocumented immigrants, President Joe Biden's recent executive order on immigration brings much-needed relief. It eases the path to employment and citizenship for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients, or 'dreamers', that is, undocumented residents who were brought to the US as children. Around 2,000 of such "dreamers" in the US are Indian, and they are now eligible to apply for employment-based visas, like the H1-B. The executive order also lifted some application requirements for undocumented spouses of US citizens. However, for the nearly 1.6 million Indian citizens residing legally in the U.S., neither Biden nor Trump have delivered meaningful reforms, though both presidential candidates have indicated support for high-skilled, employment-based immigration from India.</p>

<p>Dip Patel is a "documented dreamer." Brought to the US as a child by Indian parents on H1-B visas, he faced self-deportation (voluntary departure from the country in advance of legal proceedings) at the age of 21 if he did not qualify for an employment visa. "When I was in high school, I realised that every decision and choice that I was making would impact my ability to remain in the country," he said. "Later, I would learn that this is something that's affecting not just me but thousands of people like me."&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Narrow Avenues</strong></h2>

<p>Patel founded Improve the Dream, a youth-led grassroots organisation, to advocate for around 2 lakh "documented dreamers" in the US, most of whom are Indian-American. These are immigrants like Patel who face self-deportation because their parents did not receive a green card - for which the wait could be 134 years - before they turned 21. The H1-B lottery, the primary pathway to remaining in the states for 'documented dreamers', had an approval rate of 14.6% in FY2024.</p>

<p>"With the current lottery system, the chance of visa approval is very low, and that's going to go down even more, since there's going to be many more DACA recipients applying," says Patel. "And that's absolutely not to say that they don't deserve that opportunity - rather that the administration must prioritise [systemic reform]." Indians were granted 74.1% of H1-B visas in 2021, which remains the primary mode of immigration from India to the US.</p>

<p>"Nothing good has happened in 34 years," says Charles Foster, senior immigration advisor to George Bush and Barack Obama, and former president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association (famously portrayed in Mao's Last Dancer). "I've known Biden since I supported his first presidential campaign in 1988, and his heart is in the right position. [But] Congress has not enacted major legislation on immigration since 1990."</p>

<h2><strong>Immigration Still A Sticky Issue</strong></h2>

<p>Congresswoman Deborah Ross, member of the House India Caucus and immigration subcommittee of the Judiciary committee, is one of the staunchest advocates in the Congress immigration reform. "The good news is that we now have bipartisan, bicameral legislation to include 'documented dreamers' with the original dreamers...that passed the House twice. But we are not moving on immigration issues because of the political fights and the fights over the border," she said. Patel added that "any sort of immigration bill is very, very hard right now [due to Republican opposition]".</p>

<p>The pressing issue is the annual cap of H1-B issuances to 65,000 a year, and country quotas on green cards of 7%, which means that no single country can receive more than 7% of the annual employment-based green card allotment. For the 1.1 million Indians stuck in the green card backlog, this could mean a lifetime of waiting; for the thousands of Indian applicants in the H1-B lottery, it could mean deportation.</p>

<p>"The problem is that the right wing of the Republican Party is not willing to admit that we need more workers and more skilled workers in this country," says Rep. Ross. "I absolutely believe voters that care about positive immigration reform are being completely overlooked. I have a growing Asian-American and Latino community in my district. Every time I talk to the Chamber of Commerce, I hear about this issue. It's the number one issue for the hospitality and restaurant industry."</p>

<h2><strong>'I Need Staff'</strong></h2>

<p>Kiran Verma, one of the most celebrated Indian chefs in America, who was invited to the White House by the Obamas, says: "I have been running Kiran's in Houston for over two decades and never has the situation been so dire with a dearth of trained manpower. I need chefs, I need wait staff, I need managers. It used to be so much easier to get them from India. Now, even the best talent can't come because the process is so cumbersome."</p>

<p>Trump, however, is even less likely than Biden to be an ally for Indian immigrants, even if they are college-educated. "He said things like this even before his last term, but his actual record shows that he made it worse for legal immigrants," said Patel. "He walked back his claims about green cards the very next day." Project 2025, the recently released policy playbook for a second Trump presidency, proposes to use backlog numbers to trigger the automatic suspension of application intake for large categories, among other restrictions on immigration.</p>

<p>The question remains whether positive immigration reform will be a decisive factor in the election, particularly at a time when support for Biden among Indian-American voters has declined by 19% since the debate. Even for Indian-Americans who support Trump, immigration remains an important issue. Jugal Malani, CEO of Unique Group Industries and president of India House Houston (and organiser of Howdy Modi in 2019), says that while he does still support Trump in 2024, "I absolutely support immigration reform: this country runs on immigrants."</p>

<h2><strong>The Risk Of Losing Talent</strong></h2>

<p>Rep. Ross said, "I was in India less than a year ago. And what I heard was that the younger people in India, many of whom have come to my district for advanced degrees and to do amazing work, now don't think it's worth it. And so they're staying in India, and India, frankly, likes that." Indeed, there was a 38% drop in overall H1-B applications for FY2025. "We're going to lose talent - and when we lose talent, we lose our competitiveness," she said.</p>

<p>Verma agrees. "My journey would not have been fulfilled had the immigration laws been the same as today. The promise of the American dream must go on. I hope we can fix the issue with whoever comes to power this November in the White House," he says.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In its first statement after the massive Microsoft outage caused by an update to CrowdStrike 'Falcon Sensor', the security firm's CEO has said the issue has been isolated and a fix has been deployed.</p>

<p>The bug has affected many stock exchanges, supermarkets and flight operations across the globe. Users are experiencing the Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) error, which is causing their systems to shut down or restart unexpectedly.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a statement on X, CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz said that the company is working with customers who have been impacted by a defect found in a single content update for Windows hosts, adding that Mac- and Linux-based systems have not been affected.</p>

<p>Emphasising that the outage is not a security incident or cyberattack, he wrote, &nbsp;"The issue has been identified, isolated and a fix has been deployed. We refer customers to the support portal for the latest updates and will continue to provide complete and continuous updates on our website."</p>

<p>"We further recommend organizations ensure they're communicating with CrowdStrike representatives through official channels. Our team is fully mobilized to ensure the security and stability of CrowdStrike customers," he added.</p>

<p><strong>What Microsoft Said</strong></p>

<p>In a statement earlier on Friday, Microsoft said, "We remain committed in treating this event with the highest priority and urgency while we continue to address the lingering impact for the Microsoft 365 apps that are in a degraded state."&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Our services are still seeing continuous improvements while we continue to take mitigation actions," it added.</p>

<p><strong>Workarounds</strong></p>

<p>In an advisory, the Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In) has said the following method can be used as a workaround:</p>

<p>- Boot Windows into Safe Mode or the Windows Recovery Environment Navigate to the C:\Windows\System32\drivers\CrowdStrike directory Locate the file matching "C-00000291*.sys", and delete it.</p>

<p>- Boot the host normally.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>High drama was witnessed on Wednesday evening when an armed robbery suspect with an infant in the back seat, led law enforcement on a high-speed chase throughout Los Angeles County. The suspect even livestreamed parts of the dangerous chase on Instagram. As per&nbsp;<em><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/losangeles/news/authorities-in-pursuit-of-a-robbery-suspect-from-hawthorne/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">CBS News Los Angeles</a></em>, the pursuit began when the Hawthorne Police Department spotted a vehicle believed to be connected to an armed robbery in Beverly Hills, leading to a high-octane chase that blazed through the streets.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The suspect recklessly evaded police, speeding through red lights at over 60 mph and driving on the wrong side of the road during rush-hour traffic. During the chase, the suspect livestreamed himself evading the police, while a woman in the background pleaded with him to let her and their baby out of the car. However, it was not until much later that they were able to exit the car safely.</p>

<p>The pursuit concluded at a dead end in a Blair Hills neighbourhood.

He then hugged and kissed his girlfriend before ultimately surrendering to the authorities.</p>

<p>The suspect allegedly carjacked his girlfriend's car, according to the Sheriff's Department.&nbsp;The deputies said they were shocked to discover that the suspect had led them on a dangerous chase with his child in the car.</p>

<p>''It's crazy to think that not only is this guy driving like a madman, not only does he have his 2-month-old daughter in the car and his child's mother, but he's taking the time to get on his phone and livestream the whole thing. It goes beyond words when you meet an individual like that,'' Deputy Tony Lomedico said at a press conference.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Following the arrest, the suspect was identified as 21-year-old Daiyaan Henderson. He faces multiple charges, including carjacking and kidnapping&nbsp;in addition to armed robbery and being a felon in possession of a firearm, according to the sheriff's department. Although the woman in the car was found to be the mother of his child and was not arrested, she was determined to be a victim in the incident.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just like the Y2K bug had the world on edge at the turn of the millennium, <a href="http:// https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/windows-systems-restarting-throwing-blue-screen-of-death-due-to-crowdstrike-error-6138820 ">Windows</a> users on Friday experienced a similar sense of panic. Their screens flashed the dreaded Blue Screen of Death (BSOD).<br />
<br />
The sudden crashes and restarts, triggered by a recent CrowdStrike update, are disrupting companies, banks and government offices globally. This current situation has stirred significant concern, much like the Y2K bug in 2000.<br />
<br />
<strong>Understanding the Y2K bug</strong></p>

<p>The&nbsp;<em>Y2K</em> (year 2000) bug, a Windows flaw, threatened to cause problems when dealing with dates beyond December 31, 1999. Computer programmers and users worldwide faced this issue on January 1, 2000, and the bug also came to be known as the "millennium bug."</p>

<p>In the 1960s-1980s, computer engineers used a two-digit code for the year, omitting the "19" to save data storage space. This shortened date format caused concerns as the year 2000 approached. Programmers realised that computers might interpret "00" as 1900, not 2000, damaging or flawing activities programmed on a daily or yearly basis.</p>

<p><strong>Y2K impact</strong></p>

<p>Banks, calculating interest rates daily, faced significant problems due to the Y2K bug. The bug caused computers to miscalculate interest rates, charging customers for minus 100 years instead of one day. This error resulted in incorrect interest charges, potentially harming customers.</p>

<p>Power plants, relying on routine computer maintenance for safety checks, were also under threat. The Y2K bug disrupted calculations for critical safety checks, such as water pressure and radiation levels, putting nearby residents at risk of accidents.<br />
<br />
Transportation systems, including airlines, were also vulnerable to the Y2K bug. Computers responsible for scheduling flights failed to accurately calculate the correct time and date. It led to potential flight disruptions and safety risks, especially since there were very few airline flights in 1900.</p>

<p><strong>Response and solutions</strong></p>

<p>The Y2K bug was a dual threat, affecting both software and hardware. Software companies scrambled to address the issue, providing "Y2K compliant" programs to help fix the bug. Meanwhile, hardware companies worked to ensure their machinery was compatible with the updated software.<br />
<br />
Gartner, a research firm, estimated that fixing the Y2K bug worldwide cost between $300 billion and $600 billion. Companies also provided their own estimates – General Motors said it cost $565 million, Citicorp $600 million, and MCI $400 million.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
To address the issue, the US government passed the Year 2000 <a href="https://clintonwhitehouse2.archives.gov/WH/Work/101998.html https://www.hsdl.org/c/abstract/?docid=479574 ">Information and Readiness Disclosure Act</a> and created a President's Council. This council, including officials from various agencies, oversaw preparations to ensure private companies were ready for the new millennium.<br />
<br />
<strong>How was the bug fixed?</strong><br />
<br />
The solution was surprisingly simple – expanding the date from a two-digit to a four-digit number. The fix was implemented across various industries, including governments.<br />
<br />
Despite widespread concerns, the transition to the year 2000 passed relatively smoothly. Some countries that did little to prepare for Y2K, like Italy, Russia and South Korea, experienced the same technological problems as those that invested heavily in addressing the issue. This led some to dismiss the Y2K bug as a hoax or overhyped threat.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="http://www.ndtv.com/topic/microsoft-windows" target="_blank">Microsoft</a> makes "third-rate products" - <a class="sp_lnk2" href="http://www.ndtv.com/topic/apple" target="_blank">Apple</a> co-founder <a class="sp_lnk2" href="http://www.ndtv.com/topic/steve-jobs" target="_blank">Steve Jobs</a>' damning assessment of the Seattle-based software giant, made back in 1995, went viral Friday as the company battles a major <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/microsoft-global-outage-live-updates-microsoft-faces-global-outage-multiple-users-affected-6138975" target="_blank">Windows outage issue that has affected millions of users</a>, including commercial services like airlines.</p>

<p>Microsoft Inc. said the error was due to a recent CrowdStrike update, and that it is working recover all affected services. In a detailed post on X the company said it is also "working on rerouting impacted traffic to alternate systems to alleviate impact in a more expedient fashion".</p>

<p>Meanwhile, as the company races to resolve the problem, an interview Steve Jobs gave nearly three decades ago has re-emerged online and has been widely shared.</p>

<p>"The only problems with Microsoft is that they have no taste... they have absolutely no taste. I don't mean that in a small way... I mean that in a big way. They don't think of original ideas and don't bring much culture into their products," Jobs told Bob Cringely, the tech journalist.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-media-max-width="560">

<h3><strong>Microsoft Cloud Outage Explained</strong></h3>

<p>According to Microsoft's Service Health Status updates, the preliminary root cause is "a configuration change in a portion of our Azure backend workloads (that has) caused interruption between storage and compute resources, and which (has) resulted in connectivity failures..."</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Even though the Sun is just halfway through its current cycle, the first rumblings of its next 11-year solar cycle have been detected in sound waves within it, according to a team of researchers.</p>

<p>This current cycle is presently reaching its peak, or solar maximum that occurs when the Sun's magnetic field flips and its poles swap places, until mid-2025.</p>

<p>It impacts the Sun's surface activity, with sunspots, flares, and coronal mass ejections all increasing during solar maximum.</p>

<p>This causes an increase in electromagnetic energy heading towards Earth, making auroras more visible and at lower altitudes.</p>

<p>The current solar cycle, known as Cycle 25, began in 2019. It is not expected to end for another six years but researchers from the University of Birmingham have spotted the first signs that the next solar cycle is beginning.</p>

<p>They presented the findings at the Royal Astronomical Society's National Assistance Astronomy in Hull.</p>

<p>Dr. Rachel Howe, Helioseismology Research Fellow at the University of Birmingham, and her team have detected early signs of solar cycle 26 through internal sound waves in the Sun, revealing bands of faster and slower rotation.</p>

<p>This pattern, observed using helioseismic data from GONG, MDI, and HMI since 1995, shows faster-moving material drifting toward the Equator before each solar cycle starts.</p>

<p>Comparing data from Solar Cycles 23, 24, and 25, researchers note a repeating but not identical pattern.</p>

<p>Dr. Howe, monitoring these changes for 25 years, is excited about the first hints of Cycle 26, expected to start around 2030, offering insights into the Sun's plasma and magnetic fields.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Windows users worldwide are experiencing the dreaded Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) error, causing their systems to suddenly shut down or restart. Microsoft has identified the issue as a recent <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/windows-systems-restarting-throwing-blue-screen-of-death-due-to-crowdstrike-error-6138820 ">CrowdStrike update</a> gone wrong.</p>

<p><strong>Why is this happening?</strong></p>

<p>CrowdStrike Engineering acknowledged the problem, stating, "CrowdStrike Engineering has identified a content deployment related to this issue and reverted those changes."</p>

<p>The bug, linked to CrowdStrike's update, has disrupted operations across numerous companies, banks and government offices globally. This issue has affected essential services and daily operations.</p>

<p><strong>Immediate fixes</strong></p>

<p>CrowdStrike has also provided workaround steps:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Boot Windows into Safe Mode or the Windows Recovery Environment (press F8 or Shift + F8 to enter Safe Mode).</li>
	<li>Go to a specific folder on your computer - C:\Windows\System32\drivers\CrowdStrike</li>
	<li>Locate the file matching "C-00000291*.sys" and delete it.</li>
	<li>Boot the host normally (Restart your computer).&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>The <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/resolving-blue-screen-errors-in-windows-60b01860-58f2-be66-7516-5c45a66ae3c6 ">BSOD</a>, also known as a STOP, can occur when a serious bug or a virus causes Windows to shut down or restart unexpectedly, often displaying a message like "Windows has been shut down to prevent damage to your computer." Both hardware and software issues can cause these errors.</p>

<p><strong>Tips by Microsoft</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>If you have recently added new hardware, shut down your PC, remove the hardware, and try restarting.</li>
	<li>If you're having trouble restarting, you can start your PC in Safe Mode.</li>
	<li>Make sure your Windows operating system is up to date by checking for the latest updates. Go to Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Update.</li>
	<li>If the issue continues, consider restoring Windows to an earlier point in time before the error occurred. Navigate to Control Panel &gt; System and Security &gt; System &gt; System Protection &gt; System Restore.</li>
	<li>If none of these steps helps, try the Blue Screen Troubleshooter in the Get Help app:</li>
	<li>In Windows, open Get Help.</li>
	<li>In the Get Help app, type "Troubleshoot BSOD error".</li>
	<li>Follow the guided walkthrough in the Get Help app.</li>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A cyber outage related to an issue at global cybersecurity firm Crowdstrike and Microsoft hit media, retailers, banks, airlines and telecoms companies across Australia and New Zealand on Friday.</p>

<p>Australia's largest bank, Commonwealth Bank said some customers had been unable to transfer money due to the service outage. National airline Qantas and Sydney airport said planes were delayed but still flying.</p>

<p>Victorian state police said some internal systems had been hit by the outage but emergency services were operating normally. The output of a number of media companies was also disrupted.</p>

<p>"Like a number of other organisations, global issues affecting CrowdStrike and Microsoft are disrupting some of our systems," a spokesperson for telecoms firm Telstra said on Friday.</p>

<p>"The issue is causing some holdups for some of our customers and we thank them for their patience."</p>

<p>Crowdstrike ran a recorded phone message on Friday when Reuters contacted its technical support saying it was aware of reports of crashes on Microsoft's Windows operating system relating to its Falcon sensor, without mentioning Australia.</p>

<p>There was no information to suggest the outage was a cyber security incident, the office of Australia's National Cyber Security Coordinator Michelle McGuinness said in a post on X.</p>

<p>"I am aware of a large-scale technical outage affecting a number of companies and services across Australia this afternoon," it said in the statement which did not mention Crowdstrike.</p>

<p>"Our current information is this outage relates to a technical issue with a third-party software platform employed by affected companies."</p>

<p>A spokesperson for New Zealand's parliament said its computer systems had also been affected.</p>

<p>State broadcaster ABC said it was experiencing a "major network outage", without giving a reason.</p>

<p>In a pre-recorded message played on Sky News Australia as regular programming was disrupted, correspondent Tom Connell said the outage was not believed to be the result of a hack.</p>

<p>"Our computers, our systems are down, all the things that make Sky News run down and indeed for many other major companies around the country," he said.</p>

<p>A Reuters reporter saw error messages on payment systems at grocery chain Harris Farm in Sydney on Friday.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A riot has broken out in UK's Leeds after police were called to attend an incident involving some agency workers and children, officials said on Thursday night.</p>

<p>According to West Yorkshire Police, they were called to an ongoing incident at Luxor Street, Harehills, at 5 p.m. on Thursday. On arrival, officers "found an ongoing disturbance which involved some agency workers and some children."</p>

<p>Soon, a crowd started to gather at the location after which officers decided to remove the agency workers and the children to a safe place. However, tensions grew and "pockets of disorder" broke out in the area.</p>

<p>Purported footage shared on social media showed a large crowd of people in the street and a police car being flipped onto its side while a bus was being set on fire.</p>

<p>"No injuries have been reported and enquiries are ongoing at the scene," it added.</p>

<p>UK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper took to social media platform X to condemn the violence. She posted: "I am appalled at the shocking scenes and attacks on police vehicles &amp; public transport in Leeds tonight (Thursday night). Disorder of this nature has no place in our society.

<p>Melbourne airport said in a statement that check-in process of several airlines are affected due to a global technology issue. Virgin Australia has said the outage is preventing all planes from coming and going at Sydney Airport. "The airline has put a stop on in-and-out flights, so it's a complete ground stop; there's no flights coming in and there's no flights going out," a staff member said at the Virgin Australia lounge, according to The Sydney Morning Herald.</p>

<p>The London Stock Exchange, reports said, has been affected by the outage. The US' Federal Aviation Administration has said all&nbsp;flights from several major US airlines – including Delta, United and American Airlines – were grounded Friday morning due to a communication issue.&nbsp;911 emergency services in several states of the US have been hit too.

Microsoft Inc. said the error is due to a recent CrowdStrike update.</p>

<p>According to Microsoft's <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://status.cloud.microsoft/" target="_blank">Service Health Status</a> updates, the preliminary root cause is "a configuration change in a portion of our Azure backend workloads (that has) caused interruption between storage and compute resources, and which (has) resulted in connectivity failures..."</p>

<p>These failures, the company said, had affected "downstream (and dependent) Microsoft 365 services".</p>

<p>CrowdStrike Engineering - a cybersecurity services firm that works with Microsoft - has identified a content deployment related to this issue and reverted those changes.</p>

<p>The company has posted steps for resolution for affected Windows users.</p>

<h3><strong>Workaround</strong></h3>

<div class="sp_only-ul-ol sp_only-ul-ol-2">
<ol>
	<li>Boot Windows into Safe Mode or the Windows Recovery Environment.</li>
	<li>Navigate to the C:\Windows\System32\drivers\CrowdStrike directory.</li>

<p>Blue Screen errors, also sometimes called black screen errors or STOP code errors, can occur if a serious problem causes Windows to shut down or restart unexpectedly.</p>

<h3><strong>What Caused Microsoft Windows Error</strong></h3>

<p>Microsoft said the preliminary root cause was a "configuration change" in a portion of its Azure backend workloads.</p>

<p>It caused interruption between storage and compute resources which resulted in connectivity failures that affected downstream Microsoft 365 services dependent on these connections, the US-based company said.</p>

<h3><strong>Microsoft Services That Are Hit</strong></h3>

<p>Microsoft said the impacted services include:&nbsp;</p>

<p>- PowerBI: Users may notice that their service is in read-only mode while we address impact.&nbsp;</p>

<p>- Microsoft Fabric: Users may notice that their service is in read-only mode while we address impact.&nbsp;</p>

<p>- Microsoft Teams: Users may be unable to leverage Microsoft Teams functions including presence, group chats, and user registration.&nbsp;</p>

<p>- Microsoft 365 admin center: Admins may be intermittently unable to access the Microsoft 365 admin center and any action may be delayed if accessible.&nbsp;</p>

<p>- Microsoft Purview: Users will see a delay in events being processed in Microsoft Purview.</p>

<p>- Viva Engage: Users may be unable to access Viva Engage.</p>

<h3><strong>Microsoft Services That Have Been Recovered</strong></h3>

<p>Microsoft said its "internal telemetry and customer signals" indicate that the following services have recovered:&nbsp;</p>

<p>- Microsoft Defender: Users may be intermittently unable to access the Microsoft Defender portal. Additionally, users may notice delays of up to two hours when raising new detections.&nbsp;</p>

<p>- Microsoft Defender for Endpoint: Admins and users may notice API requests failing and errors when opening Alerts in the Alerts page. &nbsp;</p>

<p>- Microsoft Intune: Users may experience failures with device check-in, syncing and device enrollment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>- Microsoft OneNote: Users may be unable to sync content, have delays syncing notebooks, or may be unable to open notebooks.&nbsp;</p>

<p>- OneDrive for Business: Users may be unable to access OneDrive for Business content.&nbsp;</p>

<p>- SharePoint Online: Users may be unable to access SharePoint Online sites.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Microsoft Outage Hits Flight Ops In India</strong></h3>

<p>In India, airlines Spicejet and Akasa Air said they were facing technical issues that affected their booking, check-in, and flight updates.</p>

<p>"We're currently facing a technical issue in providing updates on flight disruptions. Our team is actively working to resolve this issue. We regret for any inconvenience caused and will update you once the issue is resolved. Thank you for your patience and co-operation," Spicejet said in a post on X.</p>

<p>Akasa Air said some of their online services, including bookings and check-ins were temporarily unavailable due to "infrastructure issues" with their service provider.</p>

<p>"Due to infrastructure issues with our service provider, some of our online services, including booking, check-in and manage booking services will be temporarily unavailable.

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At least 39 people have been killed and over 2,500 have sustained injuries in Bangladesh after clashes between students, government supporters and armed police following protests against service job quotas.</p>

<p>The demonstrations began last month after the High Court reinstated a quota system, reserving 30 per cent of government jobs for family members of freedom fighters and veterans from the 1971 War of Independence.</p>

<p>However, the Supreme Court has since suspended the High Court's order and is set to hear the government's challenge on August 7.</p>

<p>In 2018, the quota system was scrapped by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's government following similar student-led protests.</p>

<h3><strong>What do Bangladesh protestors demand?</strong></h3>

<p>The protesters are demanding the government scrap the quota system, which they claim benefits only the ruling Awami League party led by Sheikh Hasina. Prime Minister Hasina, the daughter of Bangladesh's founding father Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, has been accused of using the quota system to reward her party's loyalists. Protestors allege the system is unfair and limits their job opportunities.</p>

<p>However, Prime Minister Hasina, refusing to accept any demands, has referred to the protesters as "razakar", an offensive term used to describe those who betrayed the country by collaborating with the Pakistani army in 1971.</p>

<h3><strong>What is quota system in Bangladesh?</strong></h3>

<p>The quota system in Bangladesh was introduced in 1972 and has undergone several changes since then. Before it was abolished in 2018, the system reserved 56 per cent of government jobs for various groups, but the majority of these quotas benefited freedom fighters' families.</p>

<p>Here's how the quotas were allocated:</p>

<p>Women: 10 per cent<br />
Underdeveloped districts: 10 per cent<br />
Indigenous communities: 5 per cent<br />
Disabled people: 1 per cent<br />
The system has now been reinstated again.</p>

<h3><strong>Situation in Bangladesh</strong></h3>

<p>Violence erupted across Bangladesh as police and protesters clashed in various parts of the country, including the capital, Dhaka. The protests, although going on for weeks, took a dark turn on Wednesday when Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina appeared on TV to address the escalating clashes. However, her appearance on a national broadcasting channel seemed to have the opposite effect, as the demonstrators set fire to the country's state broadcaster building on Thursday.</p>

<p>The unrest also led to widespread disruption of communication services on Friday, with internet and mobile services cut off in many areas. The protesters, comprising students, were armed with sticks and rocks, and attempted to shut down transportation services nationwide. Police cracked down on protesters, firing rubber bullets, sound grenades and tear gas to disperse them, reported Reuters.</p>]]></content:encoded>

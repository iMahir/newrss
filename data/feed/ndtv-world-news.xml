       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hossein Shamkhani, the son of Iran's former national security chief, has emerged as a major player in the global oil market, a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2024-08-30/iran-oil-secretive-trader-called-hector-seen-as-global-kingpin">Bloomberg report</a> says. Despite stringent US sanctions targeting Iranian and Russian oil, Shamkhani has managed to run international oil trading operations from the heart of Dubai.</p>

<p>Shamkhani's rise to prominence is inextricably linked to his father, Ali Shamkhani, a key figure in Iran's defence and security apparatus. Ali Shamkhani, who served as the Secretary of Iran's Supreme National Security Council (SNSC) for nearly a decade, continues to hold sway as an advisor to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While the elder Shamkhani has maintained a formidable presence in Iran's political landscape, his son has quietly built a business empire that now commands significant influence in global energy markets.</p>

<h2><strong>The Dubai Connection</strong></h2>

<p>According to Bloomberg, two years ago, a relatively unknown company, Milavous Group Ltd, leased a premium office space in a Dubai corporate tower. Within months, the firm had carved out a substantial role in the global oil market. According to sources familiar with the company's operations, Hossein Shamkhani, who operates under the pseudonym "Hector" in trading circles, is the driving force behind Milavous, the report stated.&nbsp;</p>

<p>From its strategic base in Dubai, Milavous has reportedly generated billions in revenue by selling commodities sourced from Iran, Russia, and other nations. The firm reportedly operates by blending and rebranding crude oil, often obscuring the origin of the products and complicating efforts to enforce international sanctions.</p>

<h2><strong>Influence and Evasion</strong></h2>

<p>Shamkhani's network, described by insiders as one of the largest oil trading entities in Iran, has managed to evade US sanctions through a combination of legal loopholes, strategic partnerships, and a global network of shell companies. While Shamkhani himself is not subject to US sanctions, several vessels believed to be under his control have been targeted by the US Treasury Department. However, the sheer scale of his operations, involving over 60 ships, has made it difficult for US authorities to completely dismantle his network.</p>

<p>Milavous, under Shamkhani's guidance, has also expanded its reach into major international markets, reportedly supplying oil to global energy giants like China's Sinopec, Chevron, and BP, the report says. These companies, however, maintain that they comply with all relevant laws and sanctions.</p>

<p>The US government's efforts to clamp down on Shamkhani's activities have been complicated by the potential economic repercussions. With Iran's oil exports estimated to generate $35 billion annually, any significant disruption could have ripple effects across global energy markets, particularly during an election year in the US when fuel prices are under scrutiny.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A single bottlenose dolphin, who might have been separated from its pod, is being considered responsible for a troubling series of attacks on swimmers in Tsurga, a seaside town in Fukui Prefecture in Japan.</p>

<p>The latest incident occurred on August 20, when a man in his 50s was bitten on both hands as he was trying to drive off the dolphin. This attack marks the 18th reported case since July 21 and the second within a span of two days.</p>

<p>According to NBC News, the region has seen over 48 dolphin bite incidents in the last 3 years with some victims suffering major injuries including broken bones. Most of the bites however were minor -- some little more than scratches -- but in one recent incident, an elementary school child wound up requiring 20 to 30 stitches, coastguard official Shoichi Takeuchi told AFP. The recent biting incident required beach staff to coax a dolphin away from a swimming area using water skis.</p>

<p>A Coast Guard notice warned of the potential dangers of the rising number of dolphin bites, stating, "Last year, there were many incidents in which swimmers were bitten by dolphins, with some requiring more than 10 stitches."</p>

<p>Researchers suspect a lonely male dolphin behind these attacks as injuries on the dorsal fin of the dolphin involved in the last incident match those of a dolphin off the coast spotted last year, provided dorsal fins are unique to each dolphin, similar to fingerprints in the case of human beings.</p>

<p>Tadamichi Morisaka, a researcher at the Cetacean Research Center at Japan's Mie University, who has seen photographs, told NHK, Japan, "It's reasonable to assume that they're the same individual." He also said that this particular dolphin appears to have been accustomed to human interaction over the years leading to his behaviour as it is unusual for bottlenose dolphins to approach, interact or bite with humans.</p>

<p>In a mail to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/dolphin-attacks-swimmers-lonely-japan-rcna168349" rel="No Follow, No Index ">NBC News</a>, Morisaka also said the dolphin mainly wants to merely "interact with humans", possibly owing to its loneliness rather than harm them.</p>

<p>Chief executive and founding director of Dolphin Research Australia, Elizabeth Hawkins, further said, that the animal may be a "sociable solitary dolphin" that has somehow got isolated. And, when socially isolated, Hawkins said, they "can be quite pushy, they can be quite aggressive, they can bite." Hence, she emphasized the necessity of ensuring the creature is given space.</p>

<p>As the situation develops, local officials continue to monitor the dolphin's behaviour and advise caution for those entering water.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fabrizio Longo, a 62-year-old Audi executive and passionate mountain climber, fell to his death from a height of 10,000 feet while ascending Cima Payer in the Adamello mountains, near the Italian-Swiss border.&nbsp;<span style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">According to the <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/09/02/business/audi-boss-fabrizio-longo-62-killed-in-fall-while-climbing-mountain-in-italy/" rel="nofollow, noindex">New York Post,</a></em> Mr Longo, who headed Audi's Italy-based operations, was nearing the summit when the accident occurred</span>.&nbsp; A fellow climber witnessed the incident and alerted rescue teams, who promptly responded to the scene.</p>

<p>They located his body 700 feet down a gorge, where he was pronounced dead. A helicopter retrieval team then transported his body to a hospital in Carisolo for further examination.&nbsp;At the time of the incident, he was well-equipped with various safety aids, including steel cables and ladders, which he had brought to assist him on his route.&nbsp;</p>

<p>An investigation into the circumstances surrounding his death is currently underway. Once the autopsy and other formalities are complete, Mr Longo's family will announce a date for his funeral, following the release of his body.</p>

<p>Mr Longo was born in Rimini, Italy in 1962 and graduated with a degree in political science. He began his journey at Fiat in 1987, where he honed his marketing skills before taking the helm of the Lancia brand in 2002. He joined Audi in 2012, and quickly rose through the ranks, becoming the director of Italian operations in 2013.</p>

<p>An Audi spokesperson told <em>The Post:</em> "Fabrizio Longo has been leading the Audi brand in Italy with enormous success since 2013, confirming the brand's leadership in the premium segment for 11 consecutive years. He was the source of unwavering support. His strong values and genuine care for each one created a workplace filled with warmth and respect. His infectious enthusiasm and positive energy touched and inspired Audi Italia and its stakeholders daily."</p>

<p>The Audi executive, who frequently visited the Adamello mountains was also a passionate advocate for environmental conservation, strongly supporting efforts to protect the area from the impacts of climate change.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The International Ski and Snowboard Federation also released a statement mourning his death.</p>

<p>Flavio Roda, the head of the federation, called Longo's death ''a terrible loss for the federation that has collaborated fruitfully with Longo for years.''</p>

<p>''We join the family in this moment of great pain, and with the staff of Audi Italia,'' he said.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A daughter of South Africa's former president Jacob Zuma was among hundreds of women and girls who danced for the king of Eswatini in a traditional ceremony Monday, confirming her engagement to the monarch.</p>

<p>Nomceba Zuma, 21, was among 5,000 people from around the small kingdom at the annual Reed Dance at the Ludzidzini Royal Village at Lobamba, 23 kilometres (14 miles) southeast of the capital Mbabane.</p>

<p>While the days-long ceremony is a traditional rite of womanhood, it is also been the occasion when King Mswati, 56, makes clear his choice of a new wife. He already has at least 14, some of whom he married when they were minors, and at least 25 children.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mswati's brother said last week that Nomceba Zuma would attend the Reed Dance as the "liphovela", which means the royal fiancee or concubine.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At Monday's evening ceremony, she was among hundreds of young women and girls in colourful traditional dress, some holding imitation swords and shields, who danced before Mswati and an entourage of men in traditional skins.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Her father Jacob Zuma, 82, is also polygamous by tradition and has at least 20 children. He was forced to resign as president of South Africa in 2018 under a cloud of corruption.</p>

<p>Mswati, who has ruled by decree since 1986, has been criticised for his lavish lifestyle while nearly 60 percent of the population of the small kingdom of Eswatini lives on less than Rupees 169 ($1.90) a day.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A French pensioner went on trial Monday on charges of allowing scores of strangers to rape his wife after he drugged her, in a case that has horrified the country.</p>

<p>Fifty men, recruited online, are also being tried in the southern city of Avignon alongside the main suspect, a 71-year-old former employee at France's state-owned power utility company EDF.</p>

<p>Police counted a total of 92 rapes committed by 72 men, 51 of whom were identified.</p>

<p>The men, aged between 26 and 74, are accused of raping the 72-year-old woman who, her lawyers say, was so heavily sedated she was not aware of the abuse that went on for a decade.</p>

<p>Presiding judge Roger Arata announced that all hearings would be public, granting the woman her wish for "complete publicity until the end" of the court case, according to one of her lawyers, Stephane Babonneau.</p>

<p>"She wants to raise awareness, as widely as possible, of what happened to her so that events like these never happen again," Babonneau said.</p>

<p>Another of her attorneys, Antoine Camus, said the trial would nonetheless be "a horrible ordeal" for her.</p>

<p>"For the first time, she will have to live through the rapes that she endured over 10 years," he told AFP, adding that his client had "no recollection" of the abuse that she discovered only in 2020.</p>

<p>The woman, who arrived at the court supported by her three children, did not want a trial behind closed doors because "that's what her attackers would have wanted", Camus said.</p>

<h3><strong>Some came back six times&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Police began to investigate the defendant, Dominique P., in September 2020 when he was caught by a security guard secretly filming under the skirts of three women in a shopping centre.</p>

<p>Police said they found hundreds of pictures and videos of his wife on his computer, visibly unconscious and mostly in the foetal position.</p>

<p>The images are alleged to show dozens of rapes in the couple's home in Mazan, a village of 6,000 people around 33 kilometres (21 miles) from Avignon in Provence.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Investigators also found chats on a site called coco.fr, since shut down by police, in which he recruited strangers to come to their home and have intercourse with his wife.</p>

<p>Dominique P. admitted to investigators that he gave his wife powerful tranquilisers, especially Temesta, an anxiety-reducing drug.</p>

<p>The abuse started in 2011, when the couple was living near Paris, and continued after they moved to Mazan two years later.</p>

<p>The husband took part in the rapes, filmed them and encouraged the other men using degrading language, according to prosecutors.&nbsp;</p>

<p>No money changed hands.</p>

<p>The accused rapists include a forklift driver, a fire brigade officer, a company boss and a journalist.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Some were single, others married or divorced, and some were family men. Most participated just once, but some took part up to six times.</p>

<h3><strong>Murder probe&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Many have said they thought they were simply helping a libertine couple live out its fantasies, but Dominique P. told investigators that all were aware that his wife had been drugged without her knowledge.</p>

<p>An expert said her state "was closer to a coma than to sleep".</p>

<p>Her husband told prosecutors that only three men left the house quickly after arriving, while all others proceeded to have intercourse with his wife.</p>

<p>Dominique P., who said he was raped by a male nurse when he was nine, was ready to face "his family and his wife", his lawyer Beatrice Zavarro told AFP on Monday morning.</p>

<p>"He is ashamed of what he did, it's unforgivable," she said, adding the case was one of a "sort of addiction".</p>

<p>This trial may not be his last.</p>

<p>He has also been charged with a 1991 murder and rape, which he denies, and an attempted rape in 1999, to which he admitted after DNA testing.</p>

<p>Experts said the man does not appear to be mentally ill, but in documents seen by AFP, they said he had a need to feel "all-powerful" over the female body.</p>

<p>More than a dozen feminists dressed in black protested outside the courthouse.</p>

<p>The trial is to last until December 20.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden said on Monday he was close to presenting a final proposal for a deal to release hostages held by Hamas in Gaza but said he did not think Israeli Prime Benjamin Netanyahu was doing enough to secure such an agreement.</p>

<p>Biden was speaking to reporters at the White House after Israeli forces over the weekend recovered the bodies of six hostages, including Hersh Goldberg-Polin, a 23-year-old American-Israeli, from a tunnel in Gaza where it said they were recently killed by Palestinian Hamas militants.</p>

<p>That has sparked criticism of the Biden administration's Gaza ceasefire strategy and ratcheted up pressure on Netanyahu from Israelis to bring the remaining hostages home.</p>

<p>Asked whether he thought Netanyahu was doing enough to secure a hostage deal, Biden said "No." He did not elaborate.</p>

<p>Asked if he was planning to present a final hostage deal to both sides this week, Biden said: "We're very close to that."</p>

<p>"Hope springs eternal," he added when asked whether a deal would be successful.</p>

<p>Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris were due on Monday to meet with the US hostage deal negotiating team to discuss efforts toward an agreement for the release of the remaining captives.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Princess Diana wanted to re-do her royal wedding just so she could "get the hair right," her former hairdresser told People.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Princess Diana wanted to re-do her royal wedding just so she could "get the hair right," her former hairdresser told <em>People</em>. Princess Diana and King Charles tied the knot in July 1981 in St. Paul's Cathedral, England. Her former dresser Richard Dalton had been responsible for styling her hair leading up to the grand event, although he wasn't the one who styled her hair on the big day. The task was handled by his colleague, Kevin Shanley. Now, in his book, Mr Dalton called Princess Diana's wedding day hair a "disaster" and the bride agreed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Speaking to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://people.com/princess-diana-didnt-like-her-wedding-day-hair-richard-dalton-exclusive-8704644#:~:text=%E2%80%9CDiana%20did%20express%20to%20me,day%20on%20July%2029%2C%201981." rel="noindex, nofollow"><em>People</em></a>, Mr Dalton said that Princess Diana expressed to him that she wanted a re-do of her royal wedding to "get the hair right". "Diana did express to me that she wished she could do the wedding over again to 'get the hair right,'" he said. "However, she never mentioned any other regrets while I did her hair," he continued.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mr Dalton worked with Princess Diana for a decade. He left his job in 1991. Now, with the encouragement of his friend Renae Plant, curator of The Princess Diana Museum, Mr Dalton has shared memories in his new book with Mr Plant, <em>'It's All About the Hair - My Decade with Diana'</em>, offering never-before-told stories about the beloved royal.</p>

<p>"As a loyal subject to the royal family, I never shared anything publicly until now to protect her," Mr Dalton told the outlet. "I am 76 years old, (the) same age as (King) Charles, and I wanted to document my real story. (It's) not a hairdresser's job to kiss and tell. Now I feel comfortable - 27 years have passed, and nothing in my book is detrimental to Diana's character. Just wonderful memories," he added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mr Dalton shared that even though he would sometimes only get 15 minutes to style Princess Diana's hair, he never felt the pressure" working under her. "I loved taking risks with Diana's hair by trying new things like the orchards in Thailand," he recalled, referring to his favourite hair moment he ever did for the princess.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Further, the 76-year-old said that during their decade together, he saw Princess Diana at her best - her witty sense of humour, her dedication to motherhood, and her commitment to royal work. He also saw the princess at her worst, including moments of intensely low self-esteem during her marriage with the future King Charles, which ultimately ended in 1992 - the year after Mr Dalton stopped working for the royal.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Some days she would be happy, some days quiet, some days talkative and some days sad. I experienced all of these with Diana," Mr Dalton shared in the book. He added that, on her lower days, "sparks would be flying off the hair dryer," he quipped in the book. "I got used to the stress."</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Russian President Vladimir Putin was in Mongolia for an official visit on Tuesday, his first to an International Criminal Court (ICC) member since it issued a warrant for his arrest last year.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin was in Mongolia for an official visit on Tuesday, his first to an International Criminal Court (ICC) member since it issued a warrant for his arrest last year.</p>

<p>Putin was welcomed by an honour guard the night before as he landed in Ulaanbaatar to begin the high-profile trip, seen as a show of defiance against the court, Kyiv, the West and rights groups that have all called for him to be detained.</p>

<p>The Russian leader is wanted by the Hague-based court for the alleged illegal deportation of Ukrainian children since his troops invaded the country in 2022.</p>

<p>Ukraine has reacted to the trip with fury.</p>

<p>On Monday, it accused Mongolia of "sharing responsibility" for Putin's "war crimes" after authorities did not detain him at the airport.</p>

<p>Kyiv had urged Mongolia to execute the arrest warrant, while the ICC said last week all its members had an "obligation" to detain those sought by the court.</p>

<p>In practice, there is little that can be done if Ulaanbaatar does not comply.</p>

<p>A vibrant democracy situated between authoritarian giants Russia and China, Mongolia enjoys close cultural links to Moscow as well as a critical trading relationship with Beijing.</p>

<p>It was under Moscow's sway during the Soviet era.</p>

<p>And since the Soviet collapse in 1991, it has sought to keep friendly relations with both the Kremlin and Beijing.</p>

<p>The country has not condemned Russia's offensive in Ukraine and has abstained during votes on the conflict at the United Nations.</p>

<p>The Kremlin said last week it was not concerned that Putin would be arrested during the visit.</p>

<p>- 'Get Putin out of here' -</p>

<p>The capital's central Genghis Khan Square, also known as Sukhbaatar Square, was decked out Monday with huge Mongolian and Russian flags for Putin's first visit to the country in five years.</p>

<p>A small protest gathered in the afternoon, with demonstrators holding a sign demanding "Get War Criminal Putin out of here".</p>

<p>Another protest is planned at midday Tuesday at Ulaanbaatar's Monument for the Politically Repressed, which honours those who suffered under Mongolia's decades-long Soviet-backed communist regime.</p>

<p>Mongolia's government has not commented on the calls to arrest Putin.</p>

<p>But a spokesman for President Ukhnaagiin Khurelsukh took to social media on Sunday to deny reports that the ICC had sent a letter asking it to execute the warrant when he visits.</p>

<p>Russia does not recognise the jurisdiction of the ICC.</p>

<p>And Amnesty International warned Monday that Mongolia's failure to arrest Putin could further undermine the ICC's legitimacy, while emboldening the ex-KGB spy, in power for almost a quarter of a century.</p>

<p>"President Putin is a fugitive from justice," Altantuya Batdorj, executive director of Amnesty International Mongolia, said in a statement.</p>

<p>"Any trip to an ICC member state that does not end in arrest will encourage President Putin's current course of action and must be seen as part of a strategic effort to undermine the ICC's work."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[As thousands of protesters gathered in Tel Aviv on Monday for a second consecutive day of demonstrations criticising the government, Netanyahu sought forgiveness for not being able to save them but also appealed for unity.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Monday that Hamas militants "executed" six hostages whose bodies were recovered from Gaza, shooting them "in the back of the head".</p>

<p>"These murderers executed six of our hostages, they shot them in the back of the head," he said during a press conference, rejecting the notion that Israel should respond with "concessions" in Gaza ceasefire talks.</p>

<p>The killing of the six hostages, announced by Israeli officials on Sunday, has spurred an outpouring of grief in Israel as well as anger at the government for not sealing a deal that would have secured the hostages' release.</p>

<p>Israel's health ministry said on Sunday that the six hostages were shot at close range shortly before their bodies were recovered from the Gaza Strip.</p>

<p>As thousands of protesters gathered in Tel Aviv on Monday for a second consecutive day of demonstrations criticising the government, Netanyahu sought forgiveness for not being able to save them but also appealed for unity.</p>

<p>He called on the international community to apply more pressure on Hamas to end the war triggered by the militants' unprecedented October 7 attack on southern Israel.</p>

<p>"We say yes, they say no all the time, but they also murdered these people and now we need maximum pressure on Hamas," he said.</p>

<p>"Hamas has to make the concessions."</p>

<p>Netanyahu also insisted on Monday that Israeli forces must retain control over the Philadelphi Corridor along the Egypt-Gaza border, which has emerged as a primary sticking point in talks mediated by the United States, Egypt and Qatar.</p>

<p>Hamas is demanding a complete Israeli withdrawal from the area as part of the stalled talks.</p>

<p>"The achievement of the war's objectives goes through the Philadelphi Corridor," Netanyahu said.</p>

<p>"Control of the Philadelphi axis guarantees that the hostages will not be smuggled out of Gaza," he added.</p>

<p>"I will not give in to pressure."</p>

<p>Of 251 people taken hostage during the October 7 attack, 97 remain in Gaza, including 33 the Israeli military says are dead.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A national coordination conclave of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) has condemned the incident of violence against a female doctor in West Bengal, describing it as 'very unfortunate', Sunil Ambekar, RSS Akhil Bharatiya Prachar Pramukh, said here on Monday.</p>

<p>Addressing a press conference after concluding the three-day conclave called 'Samanway Baithak', he said there was a necessity for revisiting laws and penal actions to expedite swift justice for women who suffer atrocities.</p>

<p>The incident of the rape and killing of the 31-year-old female doctor at the Kolkata hospital was discussed in detail in the Baithak, he said.</p>

<p>Mr Ambekar said it was a "very unfortunate incident" and "everybody is worried about it".</p>

<p>Observing that similar incidents were increasing in the country, he said that the meeting discussed the role of the government, official mechanism, laws, penal actions and procedures.</p>

<p>"All they find that there is a need for revisiting all these so that we can have proper procedure, fast-track procedures and we can deliver justice to the victim," Mr Ambekar said.</p>

<p>A woman doctor was allegedly raped and murdered at RG Kar Medical College and Hospital in Kolkata on August 9, and a civic volunteer was arrested.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Monday that he will meet the head of the international nuclear agency in Kyiv after the official visits the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant that has been in Russia's hands since early in the war.</p>

<p>Rafael Grossi, director of the International Atomic Energy Agency nuclear watchdog, said late on Monday in a post on X that he was on his way to the plant to "to continue our assistance &amp; help prevent a nuclear accident."</p>

<p>The plant in Ukraine's southeast - Europe's largest nuclear power plant and now in "cold shutdown" - fell to Russian troops in the first days of Moscow's full-scale invasion in 2022.</p>

<p>Both sides have since frequently accused each other of shelling the plant and both Moscow and Kyiv deny the accusations.</p>

<p>Zelenskiy and Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof visited Zaporizhzhia on Monday, a city that lies across the Dnipro's wide riverbed to the northeast of the plant, where the Ukrainian leader repeated his pleas for the West to supply more long-range weaponry to Kyiv.</p>

<p>Zelenskiy said that after Grossi visits the plant, he is set to come to Kyiv for a meeting with the Ukrainian leader, according to a video from Zelenskiy's office on social media.</p>

<p>He also said that at this point of the war, it is not possible for Ukraine to take back control of the plant.</p>

<p>"It is safer for Ukraine to control the Zaporizhzhia plant, but so far, from the point of view of the battlefield, I do not see such possibilities, and those that probably exist, they are dangerous," Zelenskiy said.</p>

<p>Russian agencies reported on Monday that a high-voltage power supply line at the plant automatically disconnected, but the plant's needs are supplied from another line. There was no reason given for the automatic disconnection.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Venezuela's attorney general's office on Monday requested an arrest warrant be issued for opposition leader Edmundo Gonzalez, after Gonzalez failed to respond to three summons to testify.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Venezuelan court granted an arrest warrant Monday for opposition presidential candidate Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia, who claims to have rightfully won July elections that authorities awarded to incumbent Nicolas Maduro.</p>

<p>The court, the prosecutor's office said on Instagram, had granted its request for a warrant for Gonzalez Urrutia for "serious crimes."</p>

<p>The office had earlier published its request to the court on social media, in which it listed the alleged crimes that stem from the opposition's insistence that Maduro and his allies stole the July 28 presidential vote.</p>

<p>Venezuela's National Electoral Council (CNE), most of whose members are friendly to 61-year-old Maduro, declared him reelected to a third six-year term -- an outcome disputed by the opposition and much of the international community.</p>

<p>The United States, the European Union and several Latin American countries have refused to recognize the result without seeing detailed voting results.</p>

<p>The CNE has said it cannot publish the records as hackers had corrupted the data, though observers have said there was no evidence of that.</p>

<p>Gonzalez Urrutia, a retired diplomat who replaced opposition leader Maria Corina Machado on the ballot at the last minute, has been in hiding since shortly after the election.</p>

<p>Maduro has called for his imprisonment and that of Machado, who was barred by Venezuelan institutions from seeking election on charges widely dismissed as trumped up.</p>

<p>She, too, has been mostly in hiding since the vote, though she has led several organized protests against Maduro.</p>

<p>The opposition published its own polling-station election results, which it says show Gonzalez Urrutia won the race by a landslide.</p>

<p>This is at the source of the charges against him, which include "usurpation" of public functions, "forgery" of a public document, incitement to disobedience, sabotage, and "association" with organized crime and financiers of "terrorism."</p>

<p>- '<strong>Sabotage</strong>' -</p>

<p>Gonzalez Urrutia has ignored three summons to appear before prosecutors investigating him, prompting Maduro to label the opposition figure a "coward" who was "leading a coup d'etat from hiding."</p>

<p>Maduro has also blamed the opposition for the deaths of 25 civilians and two soldiers in protests that broke out spontaneously after the CNE announced his reelection to a third six-year term.</p>

<p>Nearly 200 people were injured and more than 2,400 arrested.</p>

<p>Since coming to power in 2013, Maduro has presided over an economic collapse that has seen more than seven million Venezuelans flee the country as GDP plunged 80 percent in a decade.</p>

<p>Last week, a blackout left most of Venezuela without power for hours on end in what the regime said was "sabotage" under a US-led plot to overthrow the socialist leader.</p>

<p>Maduro has managed to cling to power despite sanctions stepped up after his 2018 reelection, also dismissed as a sham by dozens of countries.</p>

<p>The United States on Monday seized the plane used by Maduro and his entourage, citing sanctions violations.</p>

<p>US officials took the plane in the Dominican Republic and flew it to Florida.</p>

<p>"Maduro and his representatives have tampered with the results of the July 28 presidential election, falsely claimed victory, and carried out wide-spread repression to maintain power by force," a US National Security Council spokesperson said Monday.</p>

<p>The seizure of the plane "is an important step to ensure that Maduro continues to feel the consequences from his misgovernance of Venezuela," the spokesperson added.</p>

<p>Maduro denounced the move as tantamount to "piracy."</p>

<p>Washington has had sanctions in place since 2005 against Venezuelan individuals and entities "that have engaged in criminal, antidemocratic, or corrupt actions," according to a Congressional briefing document.</p>

<p>These were expanded later under former president Donald Trump "in response to increasing human rights abuses and corruption by the government of Nicolas Maduro... to include financial sanctions, sectoral sanctions, and sanctions on the government."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At least four people were shot dead on a train in the US city of Chicago on Monday, police said, with a suspect apprehended soon after the mass shooting occurred.</p>

<p>Police said they responded to a 911 emergency hotline call early on Monday morning, arriving at the Forest Park train station where they found the four victims.</p>

<p>"Three were pronounced dead on scene, the fourth was transported to Loyola University Medical Center in Maywood, where they were later pronounced," a police statement said.</p>

<p>Gun violence is common in the United States, a country where there are more firearms than people. Attempts to clamp down on gun rights are always met with stiff political resistance.</p>

<p>Chicago police put out a description of the suspected offender based on surveillence footage, and a suspect was later taken into custody with a firearm also recovered, the statement said.</p>

<p>"This appears to be an isolated incident with no immediate threat to the community," the statement said.</p>

<p>Chicago operates one of the largest public transportation networks in the United States, with more than 317,000 people using its train system on an average weekday, according to the Chicago Transit Authority.</p>

<p>"It's a horrible situation. It's definitely something that you don't want to wake up to. It's a Monday morning on a holiday," police official Christopher Chin told reporters, referring to the Labor Day holiday being observed in the United States.</p>

<p>This year, there have been at least 378 mass shootings -- defined as a shooting involving at least four victims -- across the United States, according to the Gun Violence Archive.</p>

<p>At least 11,463 people have been killed in firearms violence, according to the GVA.</p>

<p>In June, the US surgeon general issued a landmark advisory declaring gun violence a "public health crisis" and calling for wide-ranging firearm controls that have historically been quashed by political opposition.</p>

<p>Firearms in recent years have become the leading cause of deaths for Americans aged between one and 19, above motor vehicles, the report said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President Joe Biden and Kamala Harris hit the campaign trail together for the first time Monday, in a public display of unity after she replaced him as candidate and revived Democratic election hopes.</p>

<p>To mark the Labor Day holiday, the pair were set to attend an event with union members in the key battleground state of Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>Biden, 81, bowed out of the presidential race in late July under mounting pressure after his disastrous debate performance against Donald Trump.</p>

<p>His rapid endorsement of Vice President Harris, 59, saw her shore up party support and she became the formal Democratic nominee just weeks later.</p>

<p>Riding a wave of fresh enthusiasm, she has held packed rallies in key swing states across the country and raked in cash donations for the final two-month stretch of the campaign.</p>

<p>Polls show her entry improving the party's chances at defeating Republican Trump, but with the race still neck and neck.</p>

<p>Before her event with Biden in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Harris spoke to another union crowd in Detroit, Michigan, seeking to boost support from working-class voters that Trump claims as his base.</p>

<p>Flanked by leaders of the national teachers and autoworkers unions, Harris told the Detroit crowd that Trump "intends to pull us back, including back to a time before workers had the freedom to organize."</p>

<p>"We're not going back!" the crowd chanted, using one of her campaign slogans.</p>

<p>Trump took the weekend off from campaigning, and did not have public events scheduled Monday.</p>

<p>"For a candidate that claims to be rallying the support of workers, why is Donald Trump M.I.A. on Labor Day?" the Harris campaign needled in a statement.</p>

<p>The Republican, in a post on his Truth Social platform, touted his first term economic record and accused Harris and Biden of having "undone all of that."</p>

<p><strong>- Swing states -</strong></p>

<p>Harris last appeared with Biden after his speech two weeks ago at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago.</p>

<p>As she works to define her platform, the vice president has sought to promise change, while avoiding criticism of Biden's tenure.</p>

<p>On the issue of organized labor, she has tied herself closely to Biden.</p>

<p>"The most pro-labor administration in history, under President Biden and Vice President Harris' leadership, support for union membership has grown to its highest level in half a century," her campaign said in a statement.</p>

<p>Harris has faced scrutiny for pivoting from liberal positions she ran on when competing against Biden for the Democratic nomination in 2020.</p>

<p>Harris had previously pledged to ban fracking -- a major source of income in Pennsylvania -- but now has ruled that out.</p>

<p>Pennsylvania is one of a handful of states that will decide the election, and is viewed as possibly the one on which the outcome will hinge.</p>

<p>In Pittsburgh on Monday, Harris and Biden will speak at a union hall where they will meet local members.</p>

<p>Harris is expected to say that Pittsburgh-headquartered US Steel -- which Japan's Nippon Steel is seeking to buy -- should remain domestically owned, a campaign official said.</p>

<p>Monday's joint appearance with Biden is also seen as launching the two-month sprint to the November vote, with Labor Day marking the traditional end to the US summer.</p>

<p>Earlier Monday, Harris joined Biden at the White House for a briefing on hostages and ceasefire negotiations in the Israel-Hamas war.</p>

<p>Six hostages were killed in Gaza over the weekend, including a US citizen.</p>

<p>Harris's running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, separately campaigned in Milwaukee, Wisconsin on Monday.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United States on Monday seized Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro's plane in the Dominican Republic and flew it to Florida, saying it acted over violation of US sanctions.</p>

<p>United States officials moved to take the aircraft, a Dassault Falcon 900EX private jet used by Maduro and members of his government, with the Justice Department saying the jet was "illegally purchased."</p>

<p>"The Justice Department seized an aircraft we allege was illegally purchased for $13 million through a shell company and smuggled out of the United States for use by Nicolas Maduro and his cronies," Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement.</p>

<p>Aircraft tracking site Flight Radar 24 showed that the jet flew from Santo Domingo to Fort Lauderdale on Monday morning.</p>

<p>The US says that in late 2022 and early 2023, individuals affiliated with Maduro allegedly used a Caribbean-based shell company to conceal their involvement in the illegal purchase of the jet.</p>

<p><strong>- 'False' victory claim -</strong></p>

<p>The aircraft was then illegally exported from the United States to Venezuela through the Caribbean in April 2023.</p>

<p>Since May 2023, the plane has flown almost exclusively to and from a military base in Venezuela.</p>

<p>The South American country was rocked by protests when Maduro was declared the winner of a disputed July 28 election, with dozens killed and more than 2,400 people arrested.</p>

<p>The opposition claims it won by a landslide and that it has the voting records to prove it.</p>

<p>The leftist Maduro government, brushing off accusations of authoritarianism, has resisted international pressure to release vote tally numbers to back up its claim of victory.</p>

<p>"Maduro and his representatives' have tampered with the results of the July 28 presidential election, falsely claimed victory, and carried out wide-spread repression to maintain power by force," a US National Security Council spokesperson said.</p>

<p>The seizure of the plane "is an important step to ensure that Maduro continues to feel the consequences from his misgovernance of Venezuela," they added.</p>

<p>The United States, the European Union and several Latin American countries have refused to recognize Maduro as having won without seeing detailed voting results.</p>

<p>Violence that accompanied the protests left 27 people dead and at least 192 wounded.</p>

<p>Since 2005, Washington has imposed sanctions on Venezuela that target individuals and entities "that have engaged in criminal, antidemocratic, or corrupt actions," according to a Congressional briefing document.</p>

<p>"In response to increasing human rights abuses and corruption by the government of Nicolas Maduro, in power since 2013, the Trump Administration expanded US sanctions to include financial sanctions, sectoral sanctions, and sanctions on the government."</p>

<p>Caracas was yet to comment on the seizure.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi will become the first-ever Indian PM to visit Brunei when he travels to the country on September 3 and 4 for a bilateral visit. This is being seen as a significant step in bolstering ties between the two nations.</p>

<p>"PM Modi at the invitation of His Majesty Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah is scheduled to visit Brunei during September 3-4. This will be the first ever bilateral visit by an Indian PM to Brunei," the Ministry of External Affairs said at the special briefing about the Prime Minister's visit.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Modi's visit coincides with 40th anniversary of establishment of diplomatic ties between India and Brunei.</p>

<p>PM Modi was earlier scheduled to attend the sixth summit of the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) - scheduled to take place in Bangkok on September 3, 4 - which was postponed last week due to the formation of the new government in the country.</p>

<p>PM Modi's visit to Brunei comes almost ten years after his first meeting with the Sultan of Hassanal Bolkiah in November 2014 on the sidelines of 25th ASEAN Summit in Myanmar. They met again during the 2017 East Asia Summit held in the Philippines.</p>

<p>In July, Foreign Minister S Jaishankar met his Brunei counterpart in Laos on the sidelines of ASEAN meetings. To celebrate the 40 years of diplomatic relations, the two also launched a logo together.</p>

<p>PM Modi's visit will focus on enhancing trade ties, and bolster cooperation in the space and defence sectors. India already has multiple agreements with Brunei in the space sector and also has a telemetry station in the country. The PM's visit will help strengthen cooperation in this regard, the MEA said.</p>

<p>India and Brunei also look to enhance ties in energy security in terms of crude oil and hydrocarbons.</p>

<p>Currently India imports $270 million worth of crude oil from Brunei. Brunei has also played a key role in bringing India closer to ASEAN being the Country Coordinator for India from 2012 till 2015. Brunei has been supportive of India's 'Act East Policy'.</p>

<p>On defence, the MEA said, "We are still in discussions with Brunei to set up a joint working group on defence."</p>

<p>Indian naval and coast guard ships have regularly visited Brunei and two Indian defence companies - Bharat Electronics Ltd and MKU Limited - participated in the Defence Industry Exposition organised by Brunei Armed Forces in June 2024 for the first time. Sultan Haji Hassanal Bolkiah and Crown Prince Al-Muhtadee Billah visited the Indian stalls during the expo and appreciated the Indian companies' participation.</p>

<p>As per the MEA, there are currently around 14,500 Indians living in Brunei Darussalam out of the total population of about 450,500 with more than half of the Indian expatriates being semi and unskilled workers, who work in oil and gas industries construction, retail businesses.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[Brazil's Supreme Court on Monday ratified the decision by one of its judges to suspend Elon Musk's X social network for alleged judicial transgressions.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Brazil's Supreme Court on Monday ratified the decision by one of its judges to suspend Elon Musk's X social network for alleged judicial transgressions.</p>

<p>Access to the network in the country has been blocked since Saturday morning, hours after judge Alexandre de Moraes ordered the suspension of the platform.</p>

<p>Moraes's ruling came after Musk failed to comply with an order to name a new legal representative for the company in Brazil -- a requirement X has rejected as "illegal."</p>

<p>Moraes and Musk have been locked in a high-profile feud for months as the judge has vowed to fight disinformation and Musk claims the supremacy of free speech.</p>

<p>On Monday, five Supreme Court judges, including Moraes himself, voted in a virtual session to uphold his ruling.</p>

<p>"Elon Musk demonstrated his total disrespect for Brazilian sovereignty and, in particular, the judiciary, positioning himself as a true supranational entity, immune to the laws of countries," Moraes said in the new ruling.</p>

<p>His colleague Flavio Dino added that "freedom of expression does not excuse repeated violations of the legal system."</p>

<p>Musk, who also owns Tesla and SpaceX, reacted with fury to last Friday's order, branding Moraes as an "evil dictator cosplaying as a judge" and accusing him of "trying to destroy democracy in Brazil."</p>

<p>The standoff began when Moraes ordered the suspension of several X accounts belonging to supporters of Brazil's former far-right president Jair Bolsonaro.</p>

<p>Bolsonaro had tried to discredit the voting systems used during the country's 2022 elections, which he lost.</p>

<p>Brazilian authorities are investigating whether Bolsonaro plotted a coup attempt to prevent his successor, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, from assuming office in January 2023.</p>

<p>Online users blocked by Moraes include far-right ex-congressman Daniel Silveira, who was sentenced to nine years in prison in 2022 on charges of leading a movement to overthrow the Supreme Court.</p>

<p>In April, Moraes ordered an investigation of Musk, accusing him of reactivating some of the banned accounts.</p>

<p>Musk is also the subject of a separate investigation into the alleged use of public money to orchestrate disinformation campaigns in favour of Bolsonaro and those close to him.</p>

<p>The suspension of X came just over a month before municipal elections are to be held in Brazil.</p>

<p>In August, X announced it was shuttering its offices in Brazil due to the Moraes's actions, but assured clients they would still have access to its services.</p>

<p>Until Friday, X counted about 22 million users in Brazil, according to the site DataReportal.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A mock interview of Pakistan's military exam for the selection of officers went viral on social media after the interviewer asked a candidate a question which featured Bollywood actor Katrina Kaif.</p>

<p>Sarmad Muhammad Khan, a former Pakistan Army officer who runs the 'World Times Forces Academy', asked the candidate, Ali Abbas, "Who is your favourite actress?" The candidate said Dur-e-Fishan Saleem, a Pakistani actress, followed by further questions on why he likes her.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A few minutes later, Mr Khan asked Mr Abbas, "Who is your favourite actress in Bollywood?" The candidate said, "Sir, Katrina Kaif."</p>

<p>Mr Khan gave the candidate a situation where "India is planning an attack on Pakistan, and Katrina Kaif has the information on how we (Pakistan) can stop them. She asked you to make some sort of relationship with her to get the information...Will you do it?" The candidate said, "Sir, obviously for the country's protection, I have to do it."</p>

<p>To his counter, the interviewer told the candidate "The situation is similar, but you are in Afghanistan and a person named Gul Khan asked you to do the same to get the information, will you do you now?" The candidate asked, "What kind of relationship?" Mr Khan admonished the candidate and said, "Is this your character?" Mr Khan then gave feedback the Mr Abbas, explaining the flaws in his responses.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZesbFrTAmio" rel="no follow, no index">The interviewer asked the follow-up question at the end of the interview</a>. The two clips have been combined in the now-viral video.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Several users of X and Instagram have reacted to the video, mocking Mr Khan's line of questioning. Some users from Pakistan recalled their experience of giving the ISSB interview and shared how it "feels relatable to them".</p>

<p>The Inter-Services Selection Board (ISSB) is a personality assessment exam for the selection of commissioned officers into the Pakistan Army, Navy and Air Force, similar to the procedure in India, where candidates who want to join the forces as officers undergo the Services Selection Board (SSB) interview before joining the military training academy.</p>

<p>The video has over 89,000 views on YouTube, and the channel 'World Times CSS Videos' has over 3.3 lakh subscribers. The candidate, Ali Abbas, was giving a mock interview for the Pakistan Military Academy's 119 Long Course.</p>]]></content:encoded>

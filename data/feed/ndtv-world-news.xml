       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel pounded central Beirut with a deadly air strike on Thursday while its ground troops in Lebanon were accused of firing on the UN's peacekeeping headquarters, injuring two of them.</p>

<p>The air raid on Beirut, where an AFP journalist heard several loud explosions, was the third such attack on the centre of the Lebanese capital since Israel escalated its campaign last month.</p>

<p>"The Israeli enemy's attacks on the capital Beirut this evening resulted in an updated toll of 22 people killed and 117 others injured," Lebanon's health ministry said in a statement.</p>

<p>A Lebanese security source, without giving further details, said a "Hezbollah figure" was targeted, after a series of killings of top officials in the Iran-backed movement.</p>

<p>AFP live TV footage showed two plumes of smoke billowing in between densely-packed buildings, while there was no immediate comment from Israeli authorities about the nature of the target.</p>

<p>Most Israeli strikes have targeted the south Beirut area, not the centre.</p>

<p>The attack came on the same day as the UN's peacekeeping force in Lebanon accused Israeli soldiers of "repeatedly" firing on its positions, including with a tank, leaving two Indonesian Blue Helmets with injuries.</p>

<p>Italian Defence Minister Guido Crosetto, whose country is a major contributor to the force, condemned the "hostile acts" which he said "could constitute war crimes", while Spain called it a "grave violation of international law".</p>

<p>Washington said that while Israel targets Hezbollah facilities "it is critical that they not threaten UN peacekeepers' safety and security."</p>

<p>The Israeli military said it had been operating against Hezbollah militants near UNIFIL headquarters and had "instructed the UN forces in the area to remain in protected spaces."</p>

<p>Israel has been pounding Hezbollah in Lebanon since September 23 in an escalated campaign that has killed more than 1,200 people and displaced more than a million others, according to an AFP tally of health ministry figures.</p>

<p>Its ground forces crossed into Lebanon on September 30 with the aim of stopping Hezbollah's cross-border fire in support of Palestinian militant group Hamas, which attacked Israel on October 7.</p>

<p>Hezbollah missile and artillery fire has forced tens of thousands of Israelis to flee their homes near the border over the past year, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has promised to fight until they can return.</p>

<h2><strong>HUMANITARIAN LAW</strong></h2>

<p>The Lebanon operation is a second front for Israel's stretched armed forces which are continuing their campaign against Hamas Palestinian militants in Gaza.</p>

<p>Israeli forces launched a major operation in the north of the territory at the weekend around the Jabalia refugee camp, where about 400,000 people are trapped, according to Philippe Lazzarini, head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA.</p>

<p>Speaking to reporters on Wednesday about the humanitarian situation, US State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said that Washington was "incredibly concerned" as Israel tightens its siege.</p>

<p>"We have been making clear to the government of Israel that they have an obligation under international humanitarian law to allow food and water and other needed humanitarian assistance to make it into all parts of Gaza," he said.</p>

<p>An Israeli strike on a school building in Deir el-Balah in central Gaza on Thursday left at least 28 people dead and 54 injured, according to the Palestine Red Crescent.</p>

<p>It is the latest of numerous such incidents.</p>

<p>The Israeli army said in a statement the strike targeted Palestinian combatants operating from a command-and-control centre "embedded inside a compound that previously served as the (Rafida) School".</p>

<p>The Israeli military accuses Hamas of hiding in school buildings where thousands of Gazans have sought shelter -- a charge denied by the militant group.</p>

<p>UN investigators on Thursday also accused Israel of deliberately targeting health facilities and killing and torturing medical personnel in Gaza.</p>

<p>Israel is "committing war crimes and the crime against humanity of extermination with relentless and deliberate attacks on medical personnel and facilities", the UN Independent International Commission of Inquiry said in a statement.</p>

<h3><strong>DEADLY, PRECISE</strong></h3>

<p>Ahead of Yom Kippur this Friday and Saturday, the holiest day in the Jewish calendar, Israelis are also braced for the country's reaction to a missile attack last week from Iran, which backs both Hamas and Hezbollah.</p>

<p>Iran fired about 200 missiles in what it said was retaliation for the assassination of two of its closest allies, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, along with an Iranian general.</p>

<p>Israel's Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said Wednesday that "our attack on Iran will be deadly, precise and surprising. They will not understand what happened and how it happened."</p>

<p>Biden has cautioned Israel against attempting to target Iran's nuclear facilities and opposes striking oil installations.</p>

<p>"I don't think we are currently in a situation that the two countries are seeking an all-out direct war," Hamid, a 29-year-old university student in Tehran, told AFP on Thursday.</p>

<p>"It will have severe economic and military consequences" on both countries, he added.</p>

<p>The Gaza war began on October 7 last year, when Hamas militants stormed across the border and carried out the worst attack in Israeli history.</p>

<p>The militants took 251 people hostage in an attack that resulted in the deaths of 1,206 people, most of them civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.</p>

<p>According to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry, 42,065 people have been killed in Gaza since the start of the war, a majority civilians, figures the UN has described as reliable.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lebanon's health ministry said Thursday at least 11 people had been killed in Israeli strikes on Beirut -- the third such attack on the capital since Israel escalated its air campaign last month.</p>

<p>Israel has repeatedly pounded southern Beirut suburbs, the bastion of Lebanon's Hezbollah movement, for more than two weeks but strikes have rarely targeted the city centre.</p>

<p>"The Israeli enemy's attacks on the capital Beirut this evening killed, according to a preliminary toll, 11 people and injured 48 others," the ministry said in a statement.</p>

<p>Lebanon's National News Agency (NNA) said the strikes hit the densely populated neighbourhoods of Nweiri and Basta.</p>

<p>"The first strike in Beirut targeted the third floor of an eight-storey building" in the Nweiri area, and a second strike hit "a four-storey building... in al-Basta al-Fouqa, which completely collapsed," the NNA.</p>

<p>An AFP photographer at the site of the strike in the Basta area said two old buildings had collapsed, while the windows of surrounding homes had been blown out with the force of the explosion.</p>

<p>Civil defence members and local residents were attempting to pull survivors out of the mountain of rubble, with some of them carried away on stretchers.</p>

<p>Firefighters were working to put out a blaze in a "residential building" hit in the Nweiri area, with residents being evacuated from the upper floors using a ladder, NNA reported.</p>

<p>Immediately after the raids, AFP live footage showed two plumes of smoke billowing in between densely-packed buildings.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, Israel carried out a deadly air raid in Beirut, hitting an emergency services rescue facility run by Hezbollah, killing seven workers, the service said.</p>

<p>On September 30, an Israeli drone strike on a building in Beirut's busy Cola district killed three members of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), the leftist armed group said.</p>

<p>Lebanon's Iran-backed Hezbollah movement and its foe Israel have been exchanging near-daily cross-border fire for nearly a year in fallout from the Gaza war.</p>

<p>But since September 23, Israel has escalated its air strikes on targets in Lebanon, killing more than 1,200 people and forced more than one million to flee their homes, according to official figures.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pakistan's use of the death penalty is among the harshest in the world, accounting for 26 per cent of the global death row population, according to data released by a non-profit group on Thursday.</p>

<p>A total of 6,161 prisoners were on death row in 2024, up from the 6,039 reported in 2023, legal action group Justice Project Pakistan (JPP) said in its annual report. The number contrasted with the earlier trends when the death row population stood at 3,226 in 2022.</p>

<p>The Lahore-based NGO issued the third edition of its annual report called Death Penalty in Pakistan: Data Mapping Capital Punishment, commemorating the 22nd World Day Against the Death Penalty.</p>

<p>The highest number of such prisoners was in the Punjab province at 2,505, followed by the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province at 2,311. The JPP data also showed that Pakistan's use of the death penalty is among the harshest in the world, accounting for 26 per cent of the world's death row population, 13 per cent of global executions, and 14 per cent of worldwide death sentences.</p>

<p>Since 2004, Pakistan has handed out at least 4,500 death sentences, an average of one per day. Every seventh person sentenced to death globally and every eighth person executed in the world is a Pakistani, according to the JPP.</p>

<p>Pakistan was ranked as "one of the highest users of the death penalty globally" which is a "sobering statistic", highlighting "the urgent need for reform", the report said.</p>

<p>It said that Pakistan has not carried out capital punishment since December 2019, but "remains one of the most prolific users of capital punishment, with over 31 crimes punishable by death." The NGO invited policymakers, advocates, and the general public to engage with the data as part of a broader dialogue on justice reform.</p>

<p>"The report not only presents a statistical overview of death row prisoners but also delves into the underlying issues within Pakistan's criminal justice system that perpetuate the use of capital punishment," the JPP said.</p>

<p>It said the NGO seeks to "magnify the individual stories behind these statistics, highlighting the often overlooked human toll of state-sanctioned executions."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ethel Kennedy, the widow of assassinated US politician Robert F. Kennedy, died Thursday at the age of 96, her family said.</p>

<p>"It is with our hearts full of love that we announce the passing of our amazing grandmother," former congressman Joe Kennedy III said on social media.</p>

<p>Ethel Kennedy, who died of complications from a stroke, was a key figure in a family that counted former president John F. Kennedy -- also assassinated -- and senator Ted Kennedy among its ranks.</p>

<p>She was also the mother of Robert F. Kennedy Jr, a vaccine conspiracy theorist whose failed third-party presidential bid and endorsement of Donald Trump cast a shadow over the family's dynastic status in American politics and the Democratic Party.</p>

<p>Born Ethel Skakel in Chicago in 1928, she met her future husband at the age of 17.</p>

<p>Robert Kennedy -- known as Bobby or RFK -- would go on to serve as US attorney general in his brother John's administration, serving from 1961 to 1964. He was later a senator representing New York.</p>

<p>Five years after JFK's assassination, Robert Kennedy was himself shot dead while running for president in 1968.</p>

<p>Six months after his death, Ethel Kennedy gave birth to the couple's 11th child.</p>

<p>She went on to found Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights, an advocacy organization notable for its work on freedom of expression around the world.</p>

<p>In 2014, then-president Barack Obama honored her with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian distinction in the United States.</p>

<p>Praising her "lifetime's work in social justice and human rights," Joe Kennedy III said, "we are comforted in knowing she is reunited with the love of her life, our father, Robert F. Kennedy."</p>

<p>She is survived by nine children, 34 grandchildren and 24 great-grandchildren, the former congressman said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Elon Musk's X will not be designated as a gatekeeper under landmark EU tech rules known as the Digital Markets Act which would have subjected it to an onerous list of obligations, people with direct knowledge of the matter said on Thursday.</p>

<p>The European Commission, which opened an investigation into online social media platform X in May, will announce its decision next week, the people said.</p>

<p>The EU competition enforcer declined to comment.</p>

<p>X, formerly known as Twitter, had previously told the Commission that even though it met the criterion regarding the number of users to be classified as a gatekeeper, it does not qualify for the other criterion as an important gateway between businesses and consumers.</p>

<p>Its response prompted the Commission's investigation in May to look further into the issue.</p>

<p>Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, TikTok owner ByteDance and Booking.com have been designated as gatekeepers, among others.</p>

<p>The DMA requires gatekeepers to make their messaging apps interact with rivals, let users decide which apps to pre-install on their devices and are not allowed to favour their own services over rivals or risk fines as much as 10% of their annual global turnover.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gulf states are lobbying Washington to stop Israel from attacking Iran's oil sites because they are concerned their own oil facilities could come under fire from Tehran's proxies if the conflict escalates, three Gulf sources told Reuters.</p>

<p>As part of their attempts to avoid being caught in the crossfire, Gulf states including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar are also refusing to let Israel fly over their airspace for any attack on Iran and have conveyed this to Washington, the three sources close to government circles said.</p>

<p>Israel has promised Iran will pay for its missile attack last week while Tehran has said any retaliation would be met with vast destruction, raising fears of a wider war in the region that could suck in the United States.</p>

<p>The moves by the Gulf states come after a diplomatic push by non-Arab Shi'ite Iran to persuade its Sunni Gulf neighbours to use their influence with Washington amid rising concerns Israel could target Iran's oil production facilities.</p>

<p>During meetings this week, Iran warned Saudi Arabia it could not guarantee the safety of the Gulf kingdom's oil facilities if Israel were given any assistance in carrying out an attack, a senior Iranian official and an Iranian diplomat told Reuters.</p>

<p>Ali Shihabi, a Saudi analyst close to the Saudi royal court, said: "The Iranians have stated: 'If the Gulf states open up their airspace to Israel, that would be an act of war'. But (Saudi Arabia) won't allow anybody to use their airspace."</p>

<p>The diplomat said Tehran had sent a clear message to Riyadh that its allies in countries such as Iraq or Yemen might respond if there was any regional support for Israel against Iran.</p>

<p>A potential Israeli strike was the focus of talks on Wednesday between Saudi de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi, who was on a Gulf tour to rally support, Gulf and Iranian sources said.</p>

<p>The Iranian minister's visit, along with Saudi-American communications at defence ministry level, are part of a coordinated effort to address the crisis, a Gulf source close to government circles told Reuters.</p>

<p>A person in Washington familiar with the discussions confirmed that Gulf officials had been in touch with US counterparts to express concern about the potential scope of Israel's expected retaliation.</p>

<p>The White House declined comment when asked whether Gulf governments had asked Washington to ensure Israel's response was measured. US President Joe Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke on Wednesday about the Israeli retaliation in a call both sides described as positive.</p>

<p>Jonathan Panikoff, former deputy US national intelligence officer on the Middle East and now at the Atlantic Council think-tank in Washington said: "Gulf states' anxiety is likely to be a key talking point with Israeli counterparts in trying to convince Israel to undertake a carefully calibrated response."</p>

<p><strong>OIL AT RISK?</strong></p>

<p>The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, OPEC, which is de-facto led by Saudi Arabia, has enough spare oil capacity to make up for any loss of Iranian supply if an Israeli retaliation knocked out some of the country's facilities.</p>

<p>But much of that spare capacity is in the Gulf region so if oil facilities in Saudi Arabia or the UAE, for example, were targeted too, the world could face an oil supply problem.</p>

<p>Saudi Arabia has been wary of an Iranian strike on its oil plants since a 2019 attack on its Aramco oilfield shut down over 5% of global oil supply. Iran denied involvement.</p>

<p>Riyadh has had a rapprochement with Tehran in recent years, but trust remains an issue. Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE all host US military facilities or troops.</p>

<p>Concerns over oil facilities and the potential for a wider regional conflict were also central to talks between Emirati officials and their US counterparts, said another Gulf source.</p>

<p>In 2022, the Iran-aligned Houthis in Yemen fired missiles and drones at oil refuelling trucks near an oil refinery owned by UAE's state oil firm ADNOC and claimed the attack.</p>

<p>"The Gulf states aren't letting Israel use their airspace. They won't allow Israeli missiles to pass through, and there's also a hope that they won't strike the oil facilities," the Gulf source said.</p>

<p>The three Gulf sources emphasized that Israel could route strikes through Jordan or Iraq, but using Saudi, UAE, or Qatari airspace was off the table and strategically unnecessary.</p>

<p>Analysts also pointed out that Israel has other options, including mid-air refuelling capabilities that would enable its jets to fly down the Red Sea into the Indian Ocean, proceed to the Gulf and then fly back.</p>

<p><strong>'MIDDLE OF A MISSILE WAR'</strong></p>

<p>According to two senior Israeli officials, Israel is going to calibrate its response and, as of Wednesday, it had not yet decided whether it would strike Iran's oilfields.</p>

<p>The option was one of a number presented by the defence establishment to Israeli leaders, according to the officials.</p>

<p>Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said on Wednesday: "Our strike will be lethal, precise, and above all - surprising. They will not understand what happened and how it happened. They will see the results."</p>

<p>The three Gulf sources stated that Saudi Arabia, as a leading oil exporter along with oil-producing neighbours - the UAE, Qatar, Kuwait, Oman and Bahrain - had keen a interest in de-escalating the situation.</p>

<p>"We will be in the middle of a missile war. There is serious concern, especially if the Israeli strike targets Iran's oil installations," a second Gulf source said.</p>

<p>The three Gulf sources said an Israeli strike on Iran's oil infrastructure would have a global impact, particularly for China - Iran's top oil customer - as well as for Kamala Harris ahead of the Nov. 5 presidential election in which she is running against Donald Trump.</p>

<p>"If oil prices surge to $120 per barrel, it would harm both the US economy and Harris' chances in the election. So they (Americans) won't allow the oil war to expand," the first Gulf source said.</p>

<p>Gulf sources said safeguarding all oil installations remained a challenge, despite having advanced missile and Patriot defence systems, so the primary approach remained diplomatic: signalling to Iran that Gulf states pose no threat.</p>

<p>Bernard Haykel, professor of Near East Studies at Princeton University, noted that Riyadh was vulnerable "because the Iranians can swarm those installations given the short distance from the mainland".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An Israeli airstrike on a school sheltering displaced people in central Gaza killed at least 28 people including women and children on Thursday, while three hospitals in the north were told to evacuate, putting patients' lives at risk, medics said.</p>

<p>The strike, in which many more were wounded, occurred in the city of Deir Al-Balah where a million people have taken shelter after fleeing fighting elsewhere after more than a year of war.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said on Thursday it had carried out a "precise strike on terrorists" who had a command and control centre embedded in a school.</p>

<p>"This is a further example of the Hamas terrorist organisation's systematic abuse of civilian infrastructure in violation of international law," a military statement said.</p>

<p>The Palestinian group denies such accusations. Medics said 54 other people were injured at the school.</p>

<p>In Gaza's north, the Israeli military was pursuing an offensive begun six days ago when it sent its troops into Jabalia, the largest of Gaza's eight historic refugee camps, and the nearby towns of Beit Hanoun and Beit Lahiya.</p>

<p>On Thursday, the military said it had killed at least 12 militants from Hamas and the Iranian-backed Islamic Jihad who it said were operating from a command and control centre in what was previously a medical compound in Jabalia. It said large quantities of weapons and ammunition were stored at the site.</p>

<p>Palestinian health officials say at least 130 people have been killed so far in the operation, which Israel says is aimed at preventing Hamas from regrouping.</p>

<p>The military has told residents to evacuate an area in which the UN estimates more than 400,000 people are trapped.</p>

<p>The health officials said the Israeli military on Wednesday gave patients and medics 24 hours to leave the Indonesian, Al-Awda and Kamal Adwan hospitals or risk being stormed as happened earlier in the war at Al Shifa Hospital in Gaza City.</p>

<p>Israel, which has not yet commented on evacuation orders for medical facilities, has said Hamas has command facilities concealed within the hospitals, which it denies.</p>

<p>Hussam Abu Safiya, director of Kamal Adwan Hospital, said eight patients, mostly children with critical shrapnel wounds, were at risk inside intensive-care units should the army force their evacuation, and the hospital was also running out of fuel.</p>

<p><strong>APPEAL FOR HELP</strong></p>

<p>Abu Safiya called for international pressure on Israel to allow medical staffers in north Gaza's three hospitals to continue to operate, saying: "Our message is a message of peace for the sake of those children."</p>

<p>Ramesh Rajasingham, director of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, said an OCHA-World Health Organization team could not reach Kamal Adwan Hospital despite having secured a green light from the Israeli military.</p>

<p>"The team was forced to wait at the holding point for hours, and, ultimately, the mission had to be aborted. And that's not an unusual practice," Rajasingham told a UN meeting. "In September, less than 10% of coordinated missions to the north (of Gaza) were facilitated by the Israeli authorities.</p>

<p>"The essential conditions for effective aid operations are severely lacking or entirely absent," he added.</p>

<p>Israeli bombardment near Kamal Adwan Hospital has already caused some damage to the facility, medics said. They said they know of many dead bodies lying on the roads outside the hospital because of Israeli fire.</p>

<p>The Israeli military told residents of Jabalia and nearby areas to head to humanitarian-designated zones in southern Gaza, but Palestinian and UN officials say there are no safe places to flee to in the densely populated enclave.</p>

<p>Philippe Lazzarini, the head of the UN Palestinian refugee agency UNRWA, told the UN Security Council: "Hundreds of thousands of people are again being pushed to move to the south, where living conditions are intolerable."</p>

<p>Residents said Israeli forces had encircled Jabalia and ordered them to leave through one corridor. They said troops were interrogating those leaving and making arrests, while anyone trying to leave via a different route gets fired at.</p>

<p>Hamas and ally Islamic Jihad said they continued to fight Israeli forces with anti-tank rockets and mortar bombs.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said it killed dozens more militants, seized arms and dismantled militant infrastructure in the north.</p>

<p>Israel began its offensive after Hamas-led militants carried out a cross-border attack on southern Israeli communities on Oct. 7, 2023, killing about 1,200 people and taking about 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.</p>

<p>More than 42,000 Palestinians have been killed in the Israeli offensive, the Gaza health ministry says. Most of Gaza's 2.3 million people have been displaced and much of the enclave has been laid to waste.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hurricane Milton plowed into the Atlantic Ocean on Thursday after cutting a destructive path across Florida that spawned tornados, killed at least 10 people and left millions without power, but the storm did not trigger the catastrophic surge of seawater that was feared.</p>

<p>Governor Ron DeSantis said the state had avoided the "worst-case scenario," though he cautioned the damage was still significant. The Tampa Bay area appeared to sidestep the storm surge that had prompted the most dire warnings.</p>

<p>US Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said at a White House briefing the government had reports of at least 10 deaths from Milton, adding it appeared they were caused by tornados.</p>

<p>In St. Lucie County on Florida's east coast, a spate of tornados killed five people, including at least two in the senior-living Spanish Lakes Communities, county spokesperson Erick Gill said. Search-and-rescue teams there are combing through hard-hit areas, including a mobile-home park.</p>

<p>There were 19 confirmed tornados in Florida as of 8 pm Wednesday, about the time Milton made landfall, DeSantis said. Some 45 tornados were reported throughout the day, mostly in the central and eastern parts of the state, the National Weather Service said.</p>

<p>More than 3 million homes and businesses in Florida were without power on Thursday morning, according to PowerOutage.us. At least some had already been waiting days for power to be restored after Hurricane Helene hit the area two weeks ago.</p>

<p>Milton shredded the fabric roof of Tropicana Field, the stadium of the Tampa Bay Rays baseball team in St. Petersburg, but there were no reported injuries. The ballpark was a staging area for responders, with thousands of cots set up on the field.</p>

<p>In the Tampa area, the storm toppled trees, threw debris across roadways and downed power lines, video footage from local news showed. Some neighborhoods were flooded, but the extent of the damage will not be known until crews can assess the destruction, Tampa Mayor Jane Castor said at a morning news conference.</p>

<p>Steven Cole Smith, 71, an automotive writer and editor who lives in Tampa about seven miles (11 km) from the Gulf Coast, rode out the storm with his wife. He said the wind shook the windows so hard he thought they would shatter.</p>

<p>"We really didn't have anywhere else to go," Smith said of their decision not to follow evacuation orders. He has a house in central Florida, but said the forecast for that area looked as bad as where he was staying.</p>

<p>"I spent yesterday scavenging for supplies, fuel for the generator, everything we'd need," he said. "I have a chainsaw too."</p>

<p>Luckily, he said, Tampa was spared a direct hit.</p>

<p>Ken Wood, 58, a state ferryboat operator in Pinellas County, fled his Dunedin home on Florida's Gulf Coast with his 16-year-old cat Andy, after making the "harrowing" mistake of riding out Hurricane Helene two weeks ago in his mobile home.</p>

<p>They heeded evacuation orders and headed north but only made it as far as a hotel about an hour's drive away when he decided it wasn't safe to stay on the roads.</p>

<p>"It was pretty loud, but Andy slept through it all," he told Reuters by telephone.</p>

<p>He is worried about his home but was awaiting official word that roads are clear before returning. Helene destroyed about a third of his neighborhood, and the streets were still piled with rubble that could have become wind-driven projectiles.</p>

<p><strong>'INSTANTANEOUS'</strong></p>

<p>Emergency crews responded overnight to dozens of calls for help, including one in which 15 people were rescued after a tree fell on top of a house, Tampa Police Chief Lee Bercaw said.</p>

<p>The winds toppled a large construction crane in St. Petersburg, sending it crashing onto a deserted street.</p>

<p>The state was still in danger of river flooding after up to 18 inches (457 mm) of rain fell. Authorities were waiting for rivers to crest, but so far levels were at or below those after Hurricane Helene two weeks ago, Castor said on Thursday morning.</p>

<p>Most of the severe damage reported so far stemmed from the tornados, according to Federal Emergency Management Agency head Deanne Criswell, who was in Tallahassee on Thursday.</p>

<p>"The evacuation orders saved lives," she said, noting that more than 90,000 residents went to shelters.</p>

<p>In Fort Myers on the southwest coast, resident Connor Ferin surveyed the wreckage of his home, which had lost its roof and was full of debris and rainwater after a tornado hit.</p>

<p>"All this happened instantaneous, like these windows blew out," he said. "I grabbed the two dogs and run under my bed and that was it. Probably one minute total."</p>

<p>President Joe Biden, who postponed an overseas trip to monitor Milton, spoke to local leaders in Florida on Thursday and pledged the federal government's full support.</p>

<p>The storm hit Florida's west coast on Wednesday night as a Category 3 hurricane on the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale, with top sustained winds of 120 mph (205 kph). While still a dangerous storm, Milton had weakened from the rare Category 5 status as it trekked over the Gulf of Mexico toward Florida.</p>

<p>Milton tailed off further over land, dropping to a Category 1 hurricane with top sustained winds of 85 mph (145 kph) as it reached the peninsula's east coast, the National Hurricane Center said. By Thursday morning, the storm was moving away from the Florida Atlantic coast after lashing communities on the eastern shoreline.</p>

<p>The eye of the storm made landfall in Siesta Key, a barrier island town of some 5,400 people off Sarasota about 60 miles (100 km) south of Tampa Bay.</p>

<p>In a state already battered by Hurricane Helene, as many as 2 million people had been ordered to evacuate ahead of Milton's arrival, and millions more live in the storm's path. Both storms are expected to cause billions of dollars in damage.</p>

<p>Florida airports remained closed on Thursday, including Tampa, Palm Beach and St. Pete-Clearwater, with exceptions for emergency aircraft, according to the Federal Aviation Administration.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The BBC on Thursday apologised after a graphic incorrectly forecast winds of more than 13,000 miles (20,000 kilometres) per hour in London, as Hurricane Milton battered the US state of Florida.</p>

<p>"Don't be alarmed folks -- Hurricane Milton hasn't made it to us here in the UK!" one of the broadcaster's meteorologists, Matt Taylor, assured the public on X.</p>

<p>"There's been a data glitch between our suppliers and the app/online. Folk are working to solve the issue," he said, adding: "No need to panic buy plywood and candles."</p>

<p>The technical gremlins on the BBC's weather app and website also resulted in overnight temperatures of 404 degrees Celsius (759 degrees Fahrenheit) being predicted for the central English city of Nottingham.</p>

<p>A BBC Weather statement apologised for "some data issues on our app and website. We are working hard to fix it quickly.</p>

<p>"Sorry -- please bear with us," it added.</p>

<p>The real forecast for Thursday was colder, clearer air moving in with rain and drizzle in the south and blustery showers near the east coast.</p>

<p>The blunder has echoes of a 1987 forecast that went down in broadcasting folklore and turned the meteorologist involved into a national celebrity.</p>

<p>Michael Fish famously told viewers during a broadcast on October 15, 1987 that "apparently a woman rang the BBC and said she heard there was a hurricane on the way.</p>

<p>"Well, if you're watching, don't worry, there isn't!"</p>

<p>A few hours later a storm dubbed the "Great Storm of 1987" -- the worst to hit southeast England for three centuries -- hit the region.</p>

<p>The BBC's meteorological mishap came as Milton smashed into Florida leaving at least four people dead and millions without power.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[This week, for the first time in decades, Israel will observe Yom Kippur, its holiest day, while fighting wars on multiple fronts.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week, for the first time in decades, Israel will observe Yom Kippur, its holiest day, while fighting wars on multiple fronts.</p>

<p>From sundown on Friday until nightfall on Saturday, markets will close, flights will stop and public transport will halt as most Jews fast and pray on the Day of Atonement.</p>

<p>But Israeli forces will continue operations against Palestinian militant group Hamas in Gaza and Shiite Hezbollah in Lebanon.</p>

<p>While Israel typically shuts down for Shabbat, some shops, services and even bus lines still operate, and some broadcasters keep providing news bulletins.</p>

<p>Since Hamas's October 7 attack last year, Israeli media has aired live on Shabbat and other religious days, delivering war-related updates.</p>

<p>Given its status as Judaism's holiest day, Yom Kippur is traditionally observed with a complete media silence.</p>

<p>But this time outlets are ready to cover any major developments or updates on the wars.</p>

<p>Several media representatives told AFP they were prepared to go live if necessary.</p>

<p>"We are on high alert this Yom Kippur, but we hope there won't be a need to go live," said Yael Melzer, spokesperson for Keshet 12 News.</p>

<p>"Each situation will be assessed individually" before deciding whether to break the holiday restrictions, she said.</p>

<p><strong>'Silent channel'</strong></p>

<p>Public broadcaster KAN will operate a "silent channel", allowing television and radio stations to remain on air and only interrupting them for urgent developments, said Ilil Shahar, deputy director of the news division.</p>

<p>Broadcasts will continue until the start of Yom Kippur, when Israel's national anthem, the Hatikva, will be played before the airwaves are silenced.</p>

<p>"We have never aired the television news this close to the start of the holiday," Shahar said.</p>

<p>"We will also have a team on standby throughout the day, something we've never done before."</p>

<p>On Thursday, Israel's Home Front Command distributed instructions on how to receive important information during Yom Kippur, highlighting the "silent channel" and its mobile phone emergency app.</p>

<p>The first time Israel was at war on Yom Kippur was during the 1948 Arab-Israeli war.</p>

<p>In 1973, Egypt and Syria surprised Israel by launching an attack on Yom Kippur.</p>

<p>Both sides suffered heavy losses, with thousands of troops killed.</p>

<p>But that war took place long before the emergence of the 24-hour news cycle and constant social media updates.</p>

<p><strong>'Everything affects us'</strong></p>

<p>Paul Frosh, a professor of communications at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, said mass and social media provided a sense of connection, which is essential during wartime.</p>

<p>"It's not just that we want to know what's happening," he said.</p>

<p>"I think what will be especially challenging this year is the loss of that sense of connection."</p>

<p>Zamira Miara, 67, from the southern city of Ashkelon, said it would be "impossible to disconnect until this war is over."</p>

<p>"We live in Israel, and everything affects and pains us", she said.</p>

<p>For some, like Itai Elgasian, 30, a shopkeeper in Jerusalem, the silence of the mainstream media may be less of an issue due to the proliferation of social media.</p>

<p>"Everyone today has their own Telegram (channel)... they can scan the news there," he said.</p>

<p>"I think on Yom Kippur, those channels will continue to broadcast."</p>

<p>For some, however, the holiday is a break from the relentless news cycle, a welcome respite that offers time to reflect and pray for the year ahead.</p>

<p>"It is escapism that is sure, positive escapism, maybe we will even enjoy it and maybe it will be for the best," said Jacky Kadosh, 72, a resident of Netanya who was visiting Jerusalem.</p>

<p>Liad Ben Moshe, 24, said a break from the constant "beeps of our phones" would allow worshippers to focus on their connection to the "creator of the world".</p>

<p>"Disconnection leads to connection," she said. "When you disconnect from the outside world, you can connect with yourself, and silence the background noise.</p>

<p>"This Yom Kippur will be more powerful because of that."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Ukrainian journalist who was captured by Moscow while reporting from occupied east Ukraine has died in Russian detention, a Ukrainian official said Thursday.</p>

<p>Victoria Roshchyna, who would have turned 28 this month, disappeared in August last year after travelling to Russian-held east Ukraine for a report.</p>

<p>She remained missing until April 2024, when her father received a letter from Moscow's defence ministry saying she was being held in Russian detention, according to Ukraine's main journalist union.</p>

<p>The circumstances of her arrest were not made public and it was not clear where she was being held inside Russia.</p>

<p>"Unfortunately, information about Victoria's death has been confirmed," said Petro Yatsenko, a spokesperson for Ukraine's prison of war coordination headquarters on Thursday.</p>

<p>"It is too early to talk about the circumstances of the death, we are working to establish them," he added.</p>

<p>Press rights group Reporters Without Borders said on social media it was "shocked" by Roshchyna's death and offered condolences to her relatives.</p>

<p>Russian news outlet Mediazona reported she died while being transferred to Moscow from a prison in Taganrog, near the Ukrainian border.</p>

<p>Thousands of Ukrainians opposed to Moscow's rule have been detained in occupied territories since Russia's invasion began in 2022, many of whom face torture at the hands of security forces, according to rights groups.</p>

<p>Ukraine said in May more than two dozen Ukrainian media officials were being held in Russian captivity and that negotiations on their return were underway.</p>

<p>Roshchyna worked as a freelancer for various independent news outlets including Ukrainska Pravda and had collaborated with the Ukrainian service of US-funded media outlet Radio Free Europe.</p>

<p>In 2022, she was awarded the Courage in Journalism award by the International Women's Media Foundation for her reporting from east Ukraine.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United States urged its ally Israel to avoid Gaza-like military action in Lebanon, after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said it could face "destruction" like the Palestinian territory.</p>

<p>Israel's military chief, Herzi Halevi, vowed to keep bombing Hezbollah targets, a campaign that has killed more than 1,200 people since September 23, "without allowing them any respite or recovery".</p>

<p>The comments came after a phone call between Netanyahu and US President Joe Biden, their first in seven weeks. The White House said Biden told Netanyahu to "minimise harm" to civilians in Lebanon, particularly in "densely populated areas of Beirut".</p>

<p>"There should be no kind of military action in Lebanon that looks anything like Gaza and leaves a result anything like Gaza," said State Department spokesman Matthew Miller.</p>

<p>Netanyahu said in a video address to the people of Lebanon on Tuesday: "You have an opportunity to save Lebanon before it falls into the abyss of a long war that will lead to destruction and suffering like we see in Gaza."</p>

<p>He added: "Free your country from Hezbollah so that this war can end."</p>

<p><strong>'Deadly, precise' retaliation</strong></p>

<p>Biden and Netanyahu's call had been expected to focus on Israel's response to last week's missile barrage by Iran.</p>

<p>Iran fired about 200 missiles at Israel in what it said was retaliation for the killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh. Most were intercepted by Israel or its allies.</p>

<p>Israel's Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said: "Our attack on Iran will be deadly, precise and surprising. They will not understand what happened and how it happened."</p>

<p>Biden has cautioned Israel against attempting to target Iran's nuclear facilities, which would risk major retaliation, and opposes striking oil installations.</p>

<p>A Lebanese government source told AFP that Hezbollah had accepted a ceasefire with Israel on September 27, the day Israel killed Nasrallah.</p>

<p>But they said Israel's response had torpedoed the plan, backed by Washington and its allies, and the Lebanese government had "had no contact with Hezbollah" since his death.</p>

<p><strong>Hezbollah rockets, Israeli strikes</strong></p>

<p>Hezbollah said its fighters were locked in clashes with Israeli troops in southern Lebanon, using rocket-propelled weapons to repel attempts to breach the border.</p>

<p>Two people were killed by suspected Hezbollah rocket fire in the northern Israeli town of Kiryat Shmona, while Israel intercepted two projectiles fired towards the coastal town of Caesarea, officials said.</p>

<p>Lebanon's health ministry said at least four people were killed in an Israeli strike on a village southeast of Beirut, an area so far largely spared from Israeli bombing.</p>

<p>Lebanon's state civil defence body said an Israeli strike killed five of its personnel in the southern village of Derdghaiya.</p>

<p>Israel has intensified air strikes on Hezbollah strongholds in Lebanon since September 23, uprooting more than a million people, according to an AFP tally of official figures.</p>

<p>Its ground forces crossed into Lebanon on September 30 in response to Hezbollah rocket and artillery attacks over the past year that have forced tens of thousands of Israelis from their homes.</p>

<p>Israel's military said Wednesday its troops "eliminated terrorists during close-quarter encounters and in aerial strikes" over the previous 24 hours, adding "100 Hezbollah terror targets were destroyed".</p>

<p>Israeli operations have expanded from border areas in the interior to the southern section of Lebanon's Mediterranean coast.</p>

<p>According to a toll from the Israeli army on Wednesday, 13 of its soldiers have died since ground operations inside Lebanon began.</p>

<p>Syrian state media reported an Israeli attack Thursday on the central provinces of Homs and Hama.</p>

<p>Off the coast of Yemen, a ship was struck and damaged by an "unknown projectile", a British maritime agency said, following months of attacks by Hezbollah and Hamas allies, the Huthis.</p>

<p><strong>Civilians trapped in north Gaza</strong></p>

<p>Israel expanded an ongoing military operation around Jabalia in northern Gaza, where about 400,000 people are trapped, according to Philippe Lazzarini, head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees.</p>

<p>Lazzarini said on X there was "no end to hell" in the area and that "recent evacuation orders from the Israeli authorities are forcing people to flee again &amp; again".</p>

<p>The army surrounded Jabalia and its refugee camp at the weekend and shelled it on Wednesday, preventing the delivery of aid, Gaza's civil defence agency said.</p>

<p>Washington said it was "incredibly concerned" about the humanitarian situation in north Gaza as Israel tightens its siege.</p>

<p>"We have been making clear to the government of Israel that they have an obligation under international humanitarian law to allow food and water and other needed humanitarian assistance to make it into all parts of Gaza," said the State Department's Miller.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 42,010 people in Gaza, according to figures from the Hamas-run territory's health ministry that the United Nations has described as reliable.</p>

<p><strong>Displaced in Beirut</strong></p>

<p>Israeli police said at least six people were wounded Wednesday, some seriously, in a stabbing rampage in the central Israeli town of Hadera.</p>

<p>In the occupied West Bank, Israeli border police killed at least four Palestinians in the northern city of Nablus, Palestinian health authorities and Israeli security forces said.</p>

<p>In Beirut, many people are sleeping out in the streets after Israeli air strikes.</p>

<p>Ahmad, a 77-year-old who did not want to give his family name for fear of reprisals, said he had a message for Hezbollah.</p>

<p>"If you can't continue to fight, announce you are withdrawing and that you have lost. There is no shame in losing," he said.</p>

<p>But Raed Ayyash, a displaced man from the south of the country, said he hoped Hezbollah would keep fighting.</p>

<p>"We hope for victory, and we will never give up."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been urged by a London-based delegation to help negotiate peace among countries that are in conflict. The conference, which was held in London, appealed to Prime Minister Modi to "intensify his efforts" to help resolve conflicts in Europe and Asia.</p>

<p>The two conflicts which have seen a worrying escalation in world are in West Asia and Europe. In West Asia, the Israel-Gaza war has spread to the north and now even involves Lebanon. To make matters worse, with Iran's ballistic missile attack on Israel, the Middle East crisis has taken a dangerous turn, with a possible all-out war between Israel and Iran.</p>

<p>The conflict in Europe is between Russia and a West-backed Ukraine. With the US and UK's move that may allow Kyiv to target areas deep inside Russia with cruise missiles supplied by Britain, Russia has amended its nuclear doctrine. Moscow has warned the NATO and the Western countries that any escalation by Ukraine to bomb territories inside Russia may lead to a nuclear response.</p>

<p>India, which has friendly ties with both Russia and Ukraine, as well as Israel and Iran, has been urging all parties involved in the crises to desist from any further escalation and resolve issues through diplomacy and dialogue. To this outcome, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has met or spoken to the leaders of all four countries and has assured all possible help in order to bring peace to the regions.</p>

<p>Today, the International Conference of Jurists and Writers for World Peace called upon all governments, international organisations and civil societies to work together to resolve conflicts through peaceful means, prioritising diplomacy, negotiation and mediation. The conference made a special appeal to PM Modi, who has close proximity and friendly relations will all the leaders involved in these conflicts.</p>

<p>A resolution adopted at the conference noted that if the escalation in these war zones are not stopped, "The world will be pushed into a third World War, which can possibly consume millions of lives across nations and cause irreversible damage to economies and the environment."</p>

<p>Dr Adish C Aggarwala, President of the International Council of Jurists, London, and International Commission of Writers, said, "There is volatility and strife in West Asia and other places (in Europe), hostile clashes are claiming hundreds of lives each day in different countries, and the international organisations are unable to bring about a ceasefire.</p>

<p>"Human lives have lost their value and the future is looking bleak and dark," he said, adding, "it is at such a time, the Jurists and Writers from across the globe came together to find ways to bring about peace in an increasingly complex world."</p>

<p>Reading out a message from Prime Minister Modi where he had stressed that "Global peace is necessary for a bright future for humanity," the chief of the international conference appealed to him to help achieve this outcome.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A group of five nuclear weapons states will hold a meeting in New York in the next two weeks, Russian state media quoted Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov as saying on Thursday.</p>

<p>The group brings together Russia, the United States, China, France and Britain, all of which are nuclear-armed states and permanent members of the United Nations Security Council.</p>

<p>Ryabkov did not announce a specific date or say what level of officials would attend.</p>

<p>The meeting is potentially significant because of a significant escalation in nuclear tensions between Russia and the West since the start of the Ukraine war.</p>

<p>President Vladimir Putin last month announced changes to Russia's nuclear doctrine, saying Moscow was extending the list of scenarios that could prompt it to consider firing a nuclear weapon.</p>

<p>In January 2022, weeks before Putin sent his army into Ukraine, the "nuclear five" issued a joint statement saying they considered the avoidance of war between nuclear powers and the reduction of strategic risks to be their foremost priorities.</p>

<p>"We affirm that a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought," they said at the time.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Catherine, Princess of Wales and her husband Prince William on Thursday made their first joint public engagement since she ended a course of chemotherapy for cancer, Kensington Palace announced.</p>

<p>The couple visited Southport, northwest England, "to show support to the community and hear how local people have come together as the town recovers" from a July knife attack that killed three children, the palace said.</p>

<p>Catherine, also known as Kate, and Prince&nbsp;William met members of the emergency services who responded to the stabbing spree at a Taylor Swift-themed summer dance class, which also injured eight other children and two adults.</p>

<p>The couple, both 42, heard "about their experiences of responding to the attack and the impact it has had on their mental health," their office said in a statement.</p>

<p>The royals also met mental health practitioners who have been supporting emergency responders since the attack.</p>

<p>Kate&nbsp;Middleton announced on September 9 that she had finished her chemotherapy treatment and was striving to be cancer-free.</p>

<p>In a highly emotional video message following her shock diagnosis that saw her stay out of the public eye, she said she was on a long road to "full recovery".</p>

<p>A week later, she took a first step towards returning to her work on the early-years development of children, holding a meeting with staff from the Royal Foundation Centre for Early Childhood which she established.</p>

<p>It was seen as a further positive sign that Kate&nbsp;Middleton, a future queen, was making good progress in her cancer battle.</p>

<p>Footage of Thursday's engagement showed Kate&nbsp;Middleton, wearing a long brown coat and heels, arriving at a community centre in Southport after meeting the attack victims' families in private.</p>

<p>She and Prince&nbsp;William spent around half an hour with each of the three family groups and were 45 minutes late arriving at the centre, according to Britain's domestic Press Association news agency.</p>

<p>Prince&nbsp;William could be heard apologising to the waiting guests on arrival, it said.</p>

<p>Unrest and riots erupted in more than a dozen English towns and cities in the week that followed the events in Southport, with authorities blaming misinformation over the identity of the alleged attacker.</p>

<p>Axel Rudakubana, who was aged 17 at the time, has been charged with murder and attempted murder over the stabbing spree.</p>

<p>He is due in court later this month for a hearing.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The UN peacekeeping force in Lebanon UNIFIL said Israeli tank fire on its headquarters in the country's south on Thursday wounded two of its members, as Israeli troops battle Hezbollah militants on the border.</p>

<p>"This morning, two peacekeepers were injured after an IDF Merkava tank fired its weapon toward an observation tower at UNIFIL's headquarters in Naqura, directly hitting it and causing them to fall," the force said, using an acronym for the Israeli military.</p>

<p>"The injuries are fortunately, this time, not serious, but they remain in hospital," it said, adding that "UNIFIL's Naqura headquarters and nearby positions have been repeatedly hit".</p>

<p>According to UNIFIL, the Israeli military also hit another position in Ras Naqura on Thursday.</p>

<p>The peacekeeping force said it hit "the entrance to the bunker where peacekeepers were sheltering, and damaging vehicles and a communications system".</p>

<p>"An IDF drone was observed flying inside the UN position up to the bunker entrance," it said.</p>

<p>UNIFIL, which has some 10,000 peacekeepers stationed in south Lebanon, has called for a ceasefire since an escalation between Israel and Hezbollah on September 23.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, "IDF soldiers deliberately fired at and disabled the position's perimeter-monitoring cameras," it added.</p>

<p>"They also deliberately fired on (a site) where regular tripartite meetings were held before the conflict began, damaging lighting and a relay station."</p>

<p>"We remind the IDF and all actors of their obligations to ensure the safety and security of UN personnel and property and to respect the inviolability of UN premises at all times," it said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Giving impetus to India's 'Act East' policy, Prime Minister Narendra Modi attended a series of meetings in Laos, which is where the ASEAN-India and East Asia summits are being held.</p>

<p>PM Modi, who is on a two-day visit to Laos on the invitation extended by his counterpart Sonexay Siphandone, was given a ceremonial Guard of Honour upon his arrival. He also participated in a blessing ceremony by senior Buddhist monks of Laos.</p>

<p>Hundreds of members from the Indian community in Laos welcomed PM Modi upon his arrival in Vientiane. The prime minister spoke with the diaspora, signed photographs and witnessed the Bihu dance being performed to welcome him.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">The welcome in Lao PDR was memorable! The Indian community is clearly very connected with their roots. Also gladdening was the local people speaking in Hindi and doing a Bihu dance! Do watch… <a href="https://t.co/DqcTQmPdNK">pic.twitter.com/DqcTQmPdNK</a></p>
— Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) <a href="https://twitter.com/narendramodi/status/1844298428227993780?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 10, 2024</a></blockquote>

<h2><strong>ANCIENT TIES</strong></h2>

<p>India and Laos have a shared heritage and culture and the prime minister today witnessed an episode of Lao Ramayana, which is called Phalak Phalam or Phra Lak Phra Ram in Laos. The performance highlighted the rich and shared links between the two nations.</p>

<p>"Vijaya Dashami is a few days away and today in Lao PDR, I saw a part of the Lao Ramayana, highlighting the victory of Prabhu Shri Ram over Ravan. It is heartening to see the people here remain in touch with the Ramayan. May the blessings of Prabhu Shri Ram always remain upon us!," PM Modi wrote on social media platform X.</p>

<p>Ramayan continues to be celebrated in Laos for centuries, reflecting the shared heritage and age-old civilisational connection between the two nations. Many other facets of Indian culture were also practised in the Southeastern nation for centuries.</p>

<p>Myanmar, Laos, Cambodia and Thailand are other nations, predominantly led by Theravada Buddhism have many Ramayan traditions with Buddhist reinterpretations and adaptations.</p>

<p>Notably, Laos was known to ancient Indians as the 'Suvarnabhumi' or the 'Land of Gold'.</p>

<p>As per historical records, when Ashoka waged a war against Kalinga, several people moved to Suvarnabhumi and brought with them Hindu and Buddhist beliefs from across the seas.</p>

<p>Laotian Ramayan is believed to be deeply influenced by the Valmikian narrative and is built on the template of Lao's history and ways of life of the people.</p>

<h3><strong>FROM 'LOOK EAST' TO 'ACT EAST'</strong></h3>

<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi today announced a 10-point plan to strengthen India-ASEAN comprehensive partnership and asserted that ties with the regional grouping were critical to guiding Asia's future.</p>

<p>PM Modi noted that India-ASEAN trade had doubled to over USD 130 billion in the past decade and announced a review of the trade in goods agreement to harness the greater economic potential of the partnership.</p>

<p>"I believe that the 21st century - the Asian century - is the century of India and ASEAN nations," the Prime Minister said while addressing the leaders of the ASEAN nations that include Malaysia, Thailand, Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Myanmar, Philippines, Vietnam, Laos and Singapore.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Proposed ten suggestions which will further deepen India's friendship with ASEAN. <a href="https://t.co/atAOAq6vrq">pic.twitter.com/atAOAq6vrq</a></p>
— Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) <a href="https://twitter.com/narendramodi/status/1844352235423318397?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 10, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p>The Prime Minister said India was commemorating the 10th anniversary of its Act East Policy, which has given new energy, direction and momentum to the historic relationship between India and the ASEAN nations.</p>

<p>"The India-ASEAN Summit was a productive one. We discussed how to further strengthen the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership between India and ASEAN. We look forward to deepening trade ties, cultural linkages and cooperation in technology, connectivity and other such sectors," PM Modi said in a post on X.</p>

<p>The 10-point plan to further strengthen the India-ASEAN partnership includes celebrating the year 2025 as the ASEAN-India Year of Tourism, doubling the number of scholarships at Nalanda University and providing new grants for ASEAN students at Agricultural Universities in India.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Modi also announced celebrating the decade of Act East Policy through several people-centric activities including Youth Summit, Start-up Festival, Hackathon, Music Festival, ASEAN-India Network of Think-Tanks and Delhi Dialogue.</p>

<h3><strong>REGIONAL TENSIONS</strong></h3>

<p>PM Modi today said the India-ASEAN friendship was very important at a time when parts of the world were facing conflicts and tensions.</p>

<p>The India-ASEAN Summit is taking place at a time when the region is witnessing tensions between the Philippines and China over maritime issues in the South China Sea and the crisis in Myanmar, where ethnic groups are battling the military regime.</p>

<h3><strong>WHAT ELSE IS PLANNED</strong></h3>

<p>Besides the 21st ASEAN-India summit, the prime minister will also attend the 19th East Asia Summit. He will also hold several bilateral meetings with heads of states from member countries.</p>

<p>PM Modi's visit underscores how the ASEAN member countries are a crucial part of India's 'Act East' policy. It also reflects New Delhi's cooperation with allies and partners with a common vision of the Indo-Pacific region.</p>

<p>The prime minister has prioritised east and southeast Asia with his vision for an initiative called SAGAR - Security And Growth for All in the Region.</p>

<p>PM Modi's visit to Laos marks important anniversaries of the establishment of India's diplomatic relations with several countries in the region - 75th with Indonesia, 75th with the Philippines, 60th with Singapore and 40th with Brunei.<br />

<p>Resource-geopolitics and security in the&nbsp;Indo-Pacific is a subject that is drawing the attention of countries in this region, which accounts for more than half the world's population, 60% of global GDP, as well as two-thirds of global economic growth.</p>

<p>Resource geopolitics and security were central to the colonial project. The prosperity of the West was built largely on access to the vast resources of the colonised countries. However, while the colonial phase of history is over, there is still concern about neo-colonialist policies operating in open or disguised form in relations between developed and developing countries in the Indo-Pacific.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>A Widening Gap</strong></h2>

<p>Non-western countries have generally benefited from globalisation with foreign investment flows, more open markets, participation in supply chains and export-led growth, even if the gap between the rich and poor nations has widened simultaneously. Most importantly, the gap between technology-rich and resource-rich countries remains unbridged.</p>

<p>Many developing countries with vast mineral resources do not have the capital and technology to exploit them on their own. They need foreign capital and technology to develop them. The gap between what they earn from the export of these raw natural resources and what the developed countries earn from processing and value-addition for industrial use is vast.</p>

<p>Critical and emerging technologies, which require a major R&amp;D and industrial base, will largely remain the preserve of the technologically advanced West. The advance they already have from the time of the Industrial Revolution is sought to be preserved to maintain their dominance of the global system.</p>

<p>The critical raw materials required for many of these technologies are largely in the non-Western countries, though a country like Australia possesses large quantities of lithium, iron ore, uranium, coal and natural gas. This is where geopolitics and security come into play.</p>

<h2><strong>Feeding Chinese Manufacturing&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p>This broad picture is blurred with a country like China becoming the world's biggest manufacturing power and needing access to natural resources to feed its vast industrial machine, critical raw materials to maintain its dominance in green technologies, for instance, besides access to agricultural resources of other countries in the region to feed its vast population with rising living standards.</p>

<p>It is noteworthy that after Australia sought an investigation into the source of the COVID-19-causing virus in Wuhan and China imposed sanctions on it, iron ore imports were not included in those curbs.</p>

<p>Apart from geopolitics and security per se, resource geopolitics is an element in the strengthening of India-Australia ties. Australia has turned towards India to reduce its over-dependence on China, and India is interested in access to Australia's natural resources such as uranium and coal in particular.</p>

<p>Indonesia, the largest producer of nickel, is trying to transform itself from an exporter into a key player in the global value chain by banning the export of the raw material.</p>

<p>China's phenomenal rise has changed the balance of power in the Indo-Pacific region and well beyond. It is at the centre of geopolitics and security in the region, which is also resource-oriented in part. It is claiming exclusive military and economic rights over large parts of the South China Sea.</p>

<p>The idea behind China's 9 or 10-dash line, which would make the South China Sea ‘Beijing's Lake', as former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said, is to change the balance of military power in the region by extending the reach of its aircraft and missiles to challenge US military power in the region.</p>

<p>The US has bases, troops and a large naval presence in the region as part of a military alliance system that includes Japan, South Korea and the Philippines. It also holds the responsibility for the security of Taiwan.</p>

<h2><strong>Threats In South China Sea</strong></h2>

<p>China seeks to strategically control the important shipping lanes that traverse the South China Sea. Some of the most dynamic economies in the world are in this region, besides China itself as the biggest exporting country, and Japan and South Korea as well. These countries trade with all geographies. Over 60% of global maritime trade passes through these waters, amounting to $3.29 trillion, according to a 2016 estimate.</p>

<p>It is believed that the South China Sea has fairly abundant oil and natural gas resources — by one estimate, approximately 11 billion barrels of petroleum and 190 trillion cubic feet of natural gas in proven and probable reserves. But these are largely in uncontested areas close to the coasts.</p>

<p>Underwater exploration for oil has been done off the coasts of Vietnam, the Philippines, Indonesia, and China. There is already conflict between China and Vietnam over oil drilling in contested areas. In the past, China also protested against ONGC drilling in Vietnamese waters that Beijing claims. ONGC is still operating in this area.</p>

<p>For India, too, resource geopolitics in the western Pacific is important. India plans to increase its investment in Russia's far-East to get access to its rich resources, be it coal, oil, natural gas, etc. The projected Vladivostok-Chennai corridor will pass through these waters. As much as 55% of India's trade is done through the South China Sea and the Malacca Strait. This underlines the importance for India of freedom of navigation in the South China Sea.</p>

<p>In the context of the opening of the Arctic route, free and unhindered access through these waters increases their strategic importance further.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The South China Sea is rich in marine life. This heavily fished area is the main source of animal protein for this densely populated zone. Regional countries want to retain or exercise rights to these fishing stocks, but China is claiming sovereignty over the continental shelf of countries like the Philippines and Indonesia, contrary to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).</p>

<h2><strong>Risks In The Indian Ocean Region</strong></h2>

<p>In the Indian Ocean, resource geopolitics and security is less of a factor than in the western Pacific Sea as there are no contested maritime territorial claims. There are, however, issues with regard to illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing and intrusions into the continental shelf of countries, which requires monitoring. For countries like India, increased Chinese maritime presence has major geopolitical and security implications.</p>

<p>The Indian Ocean holds rich marine resources, and the fisheries sector is vital for the economies and livelihoods of the populations of the littoral states. The scale of IUU fishing in the EEZs of five countries in the Southwest Indian Ocean - Kenya, Madagascar, Mozambique, South Africa and Tanzania - is a major issue.</p>

<p>Here too, China has expanded its maritime footprint through its fishing fleet. It is a major state actor responsible for much of the IUU fishing worldwide. Its Distant Water Fishing (DWF) fleet in size, destructive conduct, and geopolitical purpose stands out. For China, its DWF is an instrument of national power. China encourages its fishing companies to undertake joint ventures and sign bilateral fishing agreements.</p>

<p>According to a report, China has acquired about 75% of the 130 fishing licenses issued by Mozambique. It exploits the gaps in the competence of Regional Fisheries Management Organisations (RFMOs) in the Indian Ocean, resulting in over-fishing. There are also suspicions that its fishing fleets are part of its military surveillance and intelligence networks.</p>

<h2><strong>Exploitation Of Marine Resources</strong></h2>

<p>The Indian Ocean Rim countries are faced with common pressing challenges of over-exploitation of natural marine resources. Fishing in the Indian Ocean grew by 300% from 1950 to 2018, reaching 6.5 million tonnes annually. Most of the countries in the region have formulated their own fisheries regulations, but they lack proper standards, guidelines, coherent regional arrangement and enforcement mechanisms, owing to limited data and capacity constraints.</p>

<p>Sea bed mining will be part of global competition for resources, and this includes the Indian Ocean. Nodules containing nickel, cobalt, iron, and massive sulphide deposits of manganese, copper, iron, nickel, cobalt, iron, zinc, silver and gold are present in sizeable quantities on the sea bed. China is preparing in a big way to mine minerals like nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese. These are critical materials needed in vast quantities to build a green economy. The International Seabed Authority is still figuring out how mining should be regulated, with some environmental groups wanting an outright ban.</p>

<p>Also, the western rim of the Indian Ocean is flush with oil and gas resources. Resource-related geopolitics and security have marked this area for several decades. The volatility of this area because of its hydrocarbon resources remains. As much as 40% of the world's offshore oil production takes place in the Indian Ocean basin. It holds 16.8% of the world's proven oil reserves and 27.9% of proven natural gas reserves. Nearly 80% of India's crude oil requirement is also imported by sea via the Indian Ocean.</p>

<p>Climate change-induced phenomena, such as extreme weather events and rising ocean temperatures, adversely affect the reproductive patterns and quality of aquatic life in the Indian and Pacific oceans. Human security challenges are arising from climate change impacts such as sea-level rise, ocean acidification, and extreme weather events. The negative impacts of climate change extend beyond land-based agriculture to include fishing and aquaculture activities, which are significant components of agricultural output in the Indo-Pacific nations.</p>

<p><br />
As the population of the Indo-Pacific region increases in the coming decades, its impact on food security and the economy from marine resources will become more substantial. In the Indo-Pacific, as elsewhere, the oceans, seas and coastal areas contribute to food security and poverty eradication. And yet, the oceans are under severe threat by human activities.</p>

<p>The lack of regional maritime security architecture has prompted major powers to compete for control over these resources and sea lanes.</p>

<h2><strong>A Blue Economy</strong></h2>

<p>The focus on a ‘Blue Economy' is important for preserving the oceans as a source of human security. In the September 2015 Mauritius Declaration on Blue Economy, the Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA) recognised the need for urgent action towards improved governance structures to preserve the ocean's resources for future generations. The blue economy aims at the sustainable management of ocean resources in collaborations across borders and sectors through a variety of partnerships. Goal 14 of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) - Life Below Water - outlines the imperative need to increase cooperation for the conservation and sustainable use of the oceans, seas and marine resources.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Island states are concerned with nontraditional security threats from climate change, IUU fishing, piracy and oil spills as the biggest security threats in the Indian and Pacific Oceans. These issues have not been priority security concerns for major powers in the region, but this gap in the approach to Indo-Pacific security is being bridged.</p>

<p>India has proposed a cooperative framework to handle maritime issues in the Indian Ocean. Its objectives, as outlined by Indian Prime Minister Modi in 2015 under the banner of SAGAR (Security and Growth for All in the Region), are to seek a climate of trust and transparency, respect for international maritime rules and norms by all countries, sensitivity to each other's interests, peaceful resolution of maritime issues, and increase in maritime cooperation.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>A geomagnetic storm <a href="https://www.space.com/aurora-alert-northern-lights-far-south-illinois-oregon-g3-geomagnetic-storm-predicted">lit up</a> the night sky in parts of the US during the first weekend in October. <a href="https://www.sansa.org.za/">South Africa's National Space Agency</a> (Sansa) <a href="https://www.engineeringnews.co.za/article/sansa-warns-geomagnetic-storm-will-impact-earth-over-the-weekend-2024-10-04">told reporters</a> that the storm had originated from a solar flare “that erupted from sunspot 3842 on October 3”. It said this was the strongest Earth-facing solar flare recorded by Sansa in the past seven years and that the eruption briefly affected high-frequency radio communications, “resulting in a total radio blackout over the African region which lasted for up to 20 minutes”.</em></p>

<p><em>What is a geomagnetic storm? The Conversation Africa asked Sansa's Amoré Nel, who <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Amore-Nel">researches geomagnetics</a>, to explain.</em></p>

<h2>What is a geomagnetic storm and how common are they?</h2>

<p>A geomagnetic storm is a disturbance in Earth's magnetic field caused by solar activity. There's a reaction called <a href="https://www.space.com/what-is-nuclear-fusion">nuclear fusion</a> that occurs continuously deep within the Sun's core. This generates massive amounts of energy. Some of the energy is released as light (sunlight), some as radiation (solar flares), and some as charged particles.</p>

<p>The Sun also continuously emits a stream of charged particles known as <a href="https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/phenomena/solar-wind">the solar wind</a>. Occasionally, the Sun releases larger bursts of energy, called <a href="https://www.space.com/coronal-mass-ejections-cme">coronal mass ejections</a>. It sends clouds of these charged particles, or plasma, hurtling through space. I like to explain it to children this way: the Sun sometimes drinks a soda too fast and then burps. This “burp” is the cloud of plasma which then travels through space. These emissions don't always hit us. But when they do, they collide with Earth's magnetic field, disrupt it, and lead to a geomagnetic storm.</p>

<p>Earth's magnetic field is an invisible force that surrounds our planet, acting like a giant magnet with a north and south pole. It helps protect us from harmful solar radiation by deflecting charged particles from the Sun.</p>

<p>The solar flare from 3842 emitted both X-flares (radiation) and a coronal mass ejection. X-flares are radiation; they travel at almost the speed of light and reach Earth within minutes. That's what caused the brief communications disruption Sansa mentioned on 3 October. But the coronal mass ejection takes much longer to reach us. We'd predicted it would do so over the past weekend but in fact it only reached us on the morning of 8 October.</p>

<p>Geomagnetic storms occur fairly often. Minor ones happen multiple times per year. The severity of a storm depends on how strong the solar event was that caused it. Larger, more intense storms are less common but can happen every few years. Solar events are closely tied to the Sun's 11-year solar cycle, which has periods of high and low activity. During the peak of the cycle, called solar maximum, more sunspots and solar flares occur, increasing the likelihood of <a href="https://www.sdsu.edu/news/2024/05/qa-as-the-sun-nears-its-11-year-solar-maximum-what-can-we-expect-here-on-earth">solar storms</a>.</p>

<p>We are now heading towards the peak of <a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/solarcycle25/2022/07/27/solar-cycle-25-is-exceeding-predictions-and-showing-why-we-need-the-gdc-mission/">Solar Cycle 25</a>, which will be in July 2025. Solar maxima usually last between two and three years.</p>

<h2>Are these storms dangerous? What damage can they cause?</h2>

<p>Geomagnetic storms are not typically harmful to humans directly, but they can pose risks to modern technology and infrastructure. One of the most notable dangers is to power grids. Powerful storms can induce electric currents in power lines, potentially overloading transformers and causing blackouts, <a href="https://www.solarstorms.org/SS1989.html">as happened</a> in Quebec, Canada, in 1989.</p>

<p>Satellites in space are also vulnerable. A strong storm can damage electronics onboard, disrupt communication signals, and shorten the lifespan of the satellites themselves.</p>

<p>In aviation, geomagnetic storms can disrupt radio communication and GPS signals, which are vital for aircraft navigation. This is especially important for flights that pass near the polar regions, where the effects of geomagnetic storms are more pronounced. Astronauts and spacecraft are also at risk – the extra radiation can be dangerous for equipment and human health.</p>

<h2>Are there any upsides to this phenomenon?</h2>

<p>Auroras are a visually stunning aspect of geomagnetic storms. These colourful displays in the night sky occur when charged particles from the Sun get captured in Earth's magnetic field lines, and funnel down towards the poles. Here they interact with Earth's atmosphere, releasing energy that produces shimmering lights.</p>

<p>Auroras can be seen at both the north and south pole, aptly named the northern and southern lights. If storms are big enough, it's possible to see them in regions much further away from the poles. This happened <a href="https://www.sansa.org.za/2024/05/southern-african-skies-light-up-with-aurora-as-historic-solar-storms-collides-with-earth/">in South Africa on 11 May 2024</a>.</p>

<p>Studying geomagnetic storms provides valuable insights into space weather. By understanding how the Sun's activity affects Earth, scientists can better predict future storms and work to protect the technologies we rely on. The study of geomagnetic storms also contributes to our understanding of the Sun and space in general.</p>

<h2>Can monitoring the storms mitigate the risks?</h2>

<p>Geomagnetic storms are monitored using various instruments on Earth and in space. On Earth, magnetometers measure changes in the magnetic field, allowing scientists to track disturbances as they happen. Sansa operates a dense network of Global Navigation Satellite System receivers in Africa, and magnetometer stations in various parts of southern Africa, for this reason. The agency is currently setting up a magnetometer station in Ethiopia, too. This will improve our ability to monitor geomagnetic storms.</p>

<p>In space, satellites equipped with sensors monitor the Sun's activity and detect solar flares or coronal mass ejections before they reach Earth. This data feeds into prediction models used in space weather centres across the globe.</p>

<p>Once a storm is detected, agencies like Sansa issue alerts and forecasts. These warnings help industries such as power grid operators, satellite companies and aviation authorities to prepare for a storm.</p>

<p>For example, power companies can temporarily shut down or reconfigure parts of the grid to avoid overloading during a storm. Satellite operators can place their spacecraft into safer operating modes, such as switching off electronic components, and airlines can reroute flights away from high-risk areas.</p>

<p>Monitoring alone can't prevent all the damage caused by geomagnetic storms. But it can greatly reduce the risks. Thanks to early warning systems we can protect crucial infrastructure and minimise the effect these storms have on our daily lives.<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.

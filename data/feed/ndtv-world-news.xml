       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>France's government on Tuesday gave the go-ahead for construction of a floating landing pad on the River Seine for flying taxis set to be shown off during the Paris Olympics.</p>

<p>An official decree said that the pad "can be used until December 31, 2024" after months of suspense over whether the taxis would take to the air during the July 26 - August 11 Games.</p>

<p>The landing site will float on the Seine near the Austerlitz railway station in southeastern Paris.</p>

<p>Flights will be limited to two per hour, between 8:00 am to 5:00 pm, and no more than 900 over the whole trial period "given the experimental nature" of the vehicles, the decree read.</p>

<p>Private firms involved in the flying taxi project include Paris airport operator ADP and Germany-based Volocopter.</p>

<p>Its "Volocity" two-seaters are fitted with 18 electric-powered rotors on a circular frame above the fuselage.</p>

<p>They hope to use the global draw of the Olympics to show that the technology can efficiently link "vertiport" take-off and landing sites.</p>

<p>While four vertiports -- airports for vertical take-off and landing vehicles -- have already been set up in the Paris suburbs, including one at Charles de Gaulle airport, the Austerlitz site will be the first within the city proper.</p>

<p>Backers tout flying taxis as a low-carbon form of aviation and hope future larger versions could be used as ambulances or in other roles.</p>

<p>But many city officials in Paris have derided the plans as harmful to the environment.</p>

<p>France's national environment authority found that an impact assessment for the landing pad was "incomplete" on issues including noise pollution, energy consumption and greenhouse emissions.</p>

<p>Neither have the taxis been certified by the European Union's Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) -- meaning operators can only offer free demonstration flights during the Games.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>India is transforming at a record pace and the world is taking note, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said today at an event organised by the Indian community in Russia's Moscow.&nbsp;The country, he said, is infused with a confidence and is making things happen. "Over 140 crore Indians are making this resurgence of India possible -- they dream big, they take a pledge and then make it happen," he said.</p>

<p>In this context, the Prime Minister also referred to India's victory in the Men's T20 cricket world cup that ended the 13-year ICC trophy drought for the Men in Blue.</p>

<p>"Before 2014, we were into the pit of despair. Today, the country is full of confidence. Two patients suffering from the same ailment are in the same hospital, similarly capable doctors are attending to them. But if one patient is hopeful and the other is in despair, you will see the hopeful one will recover soon. India's asset now is its confidence," the Prime Minister said.</p>

<p>"You must have celebrated India's T20 World Cup victory here. The real story of that win is the journey towards it. Today's young India does not accept defeat till the last ball and the last moment. And victory kisses the feet of those who do not accept defeat," he said.</p>

<p>Showcasing his government's achievements, the Prime Minister said, "When India hosts the G20 Summit at the scale at which it did, the world takes notice. When India electrifies 40,000 km of rail lines, then the world notices India's power to grow. When India launches a solar mission and successfully and takes an L1 orbit, when India lands on the moon, when India builds the world's highest rail bridge, when India build's the world's tallest statue, the world sees a growing India. And India can do all this because of the potential and capability of 140 crore Indians, of its talented diaspora in every country of the world."</p>

<p>The Prime Minister said India and Russia are working together to boost global prosperity. "You all are taking India-Russia ties to new heights. With your hard work and honesty, you have contributed to the Russian society. I have been a fan of the unique relationship between India and Russia," he said, referring to Russia as India's "all-weather ally" and "trustworthy friend".</p>

<p>This relationship, he said, is based on mutual trust and respect. "Our ties have been tested multiple times, and our friendship has always emerged strong. I thank my friend, President Putin for his leadership. For over two decades, he has worked to make this partnership stronger. This is my 6th visit to Russia in the past 10 years and we have met each other 17 times during this time. These meetings have strengthened trust and respect. When our students were stuck amid (Ukraine) conflict, President Putin helped us take them home," he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Prime Minister said it is his honour that his first diaspora event after being elected for the third time is happening in Moscow. "I have taken a pledge that I will work thrice as hard and thrice as fast as I have in the first two terms. I can assure you that in this third term, you will see that India will challenge every challenge that comes its way. And it is in my DNA that I give chunauti (challenge) to every chunauti," he said.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Adult film star Jesse Jane died from an accidental overdose of fentanyl and cocaine toxicity in January 2024, her&nbsp;<a href="http://https://www.oklahoman.com/story/news/2024/07/08/jesse-jane-cause-of-death-revealed-porn-star-oklahoma-overdose-fentanyl/74323582007/ \">autopsy report</a> has confirmed. Her body was found in a decomposed state, it stated.</p>

<p>The 43-year-old actor, whose real name was Cindy Taylor or Cynthia Ann Howell, was found unresponsive in her boyfriend's home in Oklahoma on January 24, 2024. Her boyfriend, Brett Hasenmuller, 33, was also found dead at the scene.</p>

<p>The Oklahoma Medical Examiner's Office performed the autopsy, revealing acute fentanyl and cocaine intoxication as the cause of death. The report, released on Sunday, noted that Ms Jane's body was in a state of advanced decomposition, indicating she had been dead for some time before her body was found.</p>

<p>According to TMZ, the bodies were discovered after the boyfriend's boss requested a welfare check, leading cops to visit the residence. They were found dead, and their cause of death was suspected to be an overdose at the time.</p>

<p>Jesse Jane was a prominent figure in the adult entertainment industry, appearing in over 100 adult films and earning many awards and nominations. She began her porn career in 2002, signing an exclusive contract with Digital Playground Studio, where she remained until 2014. She later signed with Jules Jordan Video and announced her retirement from the industry in 2017.</p>

<p>Jane also appeared in mainstream TV shows and films, including <em>Baywatch: Hawaiian Wedding, Pirates II: Stagnetti's Revenge, Starsky and Hutch, Family Business, Entourage,</em> <em>Night Calls </em>and <em>The Bad Girls Club</em>. She also featured in the CNBC documentary <em>Porn: Business of Pleasure.</em></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The preserved body of an American mountaineer -- who disappeared 22 years ago while scaling a snowy peak in Peru -- has been found after being exposed by climate change-induced ice melt, police said Monday.</p>

<p>William Stampfl was reported missing in June 2002, aged 59, when an avalanche buried his climbing party on the mountain Huascaran, which stands more than 6,700 meters (22,000 feet) high. Search and rescue efforts were fruitless.</p>

<p>Peruvian police said his remains were finally exposed by ice melt on the Cordillera Blanca range of the Andes.</p>

<p>Stampfl's body, as well as his clothes, harness and boots had been well-preserved by the cold, according to images distributed by police.</p>

<p>His passport was found among his possessions, allowing police to identify the body.</p>

<p>The mountains of northeastern Peru, home to snowy peaks such as Huascaran and Cashan, are a favorite with mountaineers from around the world.</p>

<p>In May, the body of an Israeli hiker was found there nearly a month after he disappeared.</p>

<p>And last month, an experienced Italian mountaineer was found dead after he fell while trying to scale another Andean peak.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Boeing jetliner taking off from Los Angeles lost a wheel Monday, the latest in a string of safety scares for the aerospace giant.&nbsp;</p>

<p>United Airlines, which operated the Boeing 757-200, said the plane lost the wheel after leaving Los Angeles International Airport but landed safely in Denver, its intended destination.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The wheel has been recovered in Los Angeles, and we are investigating what caused this event," the airline said in statement.&nbsp;</p>

<p>No injuries were reported from the ground or the 174 passengers and seven crew members on board.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It was the second time in recent months that a Boeing plane operated by United Airlines lost a wheel after taking off.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In March, a Boeing 777 bound for Japan had a tire fall off shortly after takeoff from San Francisco. The aircraft had to make an emergency landing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Boeing agreed Monday to plead guilty to fraud in a settlement with the US Department of Justice over two fatal 737 MAX crashes.</p>

<p>Boeing has faced renewed scrutiny of the 737 MAX this year after a fuselage door plug blew out on the same model during an Alaska Airlines flight in January.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A Boeing spokesperson said in an email that the 757-200 aircraft that took off Monday was first delivered 30 years ago in 1994.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Production of the 757 model was discontinued in 2004.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Federal Aviation Administration is investigating Monday's incident.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump said in an interview Monday night that he thinks President Joe Biden will stay in the race for the White House despite calls for him to drop out over concerns about his mental fitness.</p>

<p>"I think he, you know, might very well stay in," Trump told Sean Hannity on Fox News, in his first interview since Biden's dismal performance in their presidential debate late last month.</p>

<p>"He's got an ego and he doesn't want to quit," Trump said.</p>

<p>The Republican ex-president also gave his first detailed account of the CNN-hosted debate in Atlanta, during which Biden often lost his train of thought and at times spoke incoherently, looking dazed.</p>

<p>"I will tell you. It was a strange debate, because within a couple of minutes, the answers given by him were, they didn't, they didn't make a lot of sense," Trump said.</p>

<p>Trump said he intentionally did not look much at Biden as he spoke.</p>

<p>"I did take a couple of peeks when he was in the midst of giving some really bad answers," Trump said.</p>

<p>"They weren't even answers. They were just words put together that had no meaning or sense."</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President Joe Biden insisted again Monday he would not quit the US election race, as the White House denied he had Parkinson's disease following a disastrous debate performance.</p>

<p>The 81-year-old dared Democratic critics to either challenge him at next month's party convention in Chicago or back him against Donald Trump in November's vote.</p>

<p>The president lashed out in both a letter to Congress and a rare call to a television program, at the start of a critical week that includes a NATO summit in Washington where he will face fresh scrutiny.</p>

<p>"I am firmly committed to staying in the race," Biden wrote in the letter.</p>

<p>"It is time to come together, move forward as a unified party and defeat Donald Trump," he said. "It's time for it to end."</p>

<p>The embattled president followed up by phoning into MSNBC's "Morning Joe" television program to say he was "getting so frustrated by the elites" in the party.</p>

<p>"Any of these guys that don't think I should run -- run against me. Announce for president, challenge me at the convention," he added.</p>

<p>Trump has been uncharacteristically quiet since the debate but he did speak out Monday on Fox News to say he thinks Biden will resist the pressure and stay in the race.</p>

<p>"He's got an ego and he doesn't want to quit," Trump said in an interview with Sean Hannity.</p>

<p>But even as he doubled down, the pressure mounted on the oldest president in US history.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Congressman Adam Smith, the senior Democrat on the US House Armed Services Committee, became the sixth Democratic lawmaker to publicly say Biden should step aside.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I think it's become clear he's not the best person to carry the Democratic message," he told CNN.</p>

<p>Other senior Democrats voiced support for Biden, however.</p>

<p>"I made clear that day after the debate publicly that I support President Joe Biden and the Democratic ticket. My position has not changed," House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries told CNN.</p>

<p><strong>Parkinson's denial</strong></p>

<p>Biden's blitz was a clear attempt to lay to rest the spiralling concerns over his health following the June 27 debate against Republican Trump, whom he trails in the polls.</p>

<p>During the debate, Biden repeatedly lost his train of thought, stared blankly and spoke at times incoherently and with a raspy voice. Biden has blamed jetlag and a cold.</p>

<p>The White House has also felt the pressure, with tense exchanges at a press briefing on Monday.</p>

<p>Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre called for "respect" while journalists challenged her refusal to confirm reports that a Parkinson's specialist visited the White House eight times.</p>

<p>The visits by Kevin Cannard, a neurologist from the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center where Biden receives his medicals, were recorded in publicly available visitor logs.</p>

<p>"Has the President been treated for Parkinson's? No. Is he being treated for Parkinson's? No, he's not. Is he taking medication for Parkinson's? No," Jean-Pierre said.</p>

<p>On Monday night the White House went so far as to release a letter from Biden's personal doctor, Kevin O'Connor, insisting that the president had not seen a neurologist outside his three annual medicals.</p>

<p>The White House also denied reports that NATO allies attending this week's 75th-anniversary summit in Washington had shown concerns about Biden.</p>

<p>"We're not picking up any signs of that from our allies at all," National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters.</p>

<p>But NATO leaders have been seeking reassurance in any case amid polls forecasting a November victory for Trump.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The former president has long criticized the defense alliance, voiced admiration for Russian strongman Vladimir Putin, and insisted he could bring about a quick end to the war in Ukraine.</p>

<p><strong>'All in'</strong></p>

<p>The NATO summit begins on Tuesday, the same day that Democrats, returning to Capitol Hill from a brief recess, hold a caucus meeting where Biden's fate will be discussed.</p>

<p>The Democrat lags behind Trump in most polls even though his rival was recently convicted of a felony in a porn star hush money case.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Recent polls suggest that Kamala Harris could perform better than Joe Biden in a hypothetical matchup against former President Donald Trump. ]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Despite US President Joe Biden's repeated assertion that he has no plans to quit the presidential race, his deputy <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/could-kamala-harris-beat-trump-in-us-presidential-race-polls-suggest-6053229 ">Kamala Harris</a> is emerging as his alternative for Democrats. Harris' recognition, policy experience and ability to connect with key voter groups make her an attractive candidate against Republican nominee Donald Trump, top democrats say.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
But can the 59-year-old defeat Donald Trump, should Joe Biden drop out?&nbsp;<br />
<br />
After what was an abysmal first presidential debate between the current and former US Presidents, critics, political observers and voices among the Democrats suggested it would be better if Biden were replaced. And the first name that struck everyone's mind was Kamala Harris. Polls suggest her candidacy could be a game-changer for the Democratic Party.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The Vice-President may perform better than Biden against former President Trump, multiple polls say. Harris trailed Trump by only two percentage points, 47% to 45% while Biden lagged by six points, according to a CNN poll released on July 2.<br />
<br />
A Reuters/Ipsos poll found her tied with Trump at 42% each. The polls showed that Harris did better than Biden with independent voters and women.<br />
<br />
However, experts are sceptical about these early polls. They think voter opinions would change if Biden dropped out and other Democrats joined the race. A pollster close to Biden's campaign thinks Harris might appeal to more voters, but isn't sure if she would make a big difference. They believe polls this early don't mean much. Harris does well with young voters and minorities – important groups for Democrats. But it is unclear if she would boost turnout among these voters. For now, it's a "wait and see" situation.<br />
<br />
During NBC's Meet the Press Sunday, Congressman Adam Schiff (D-CA) suggested that President Biden either secure a resounding victory or cede the nomination to a candidate capable of doing so. Kamala Harris could “very well win overwhelmingly” against Trump, he added.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Jamal Simmons, a seasoned Democratic strategist and former communications director for Kamala Harris, warns against “underestimating” the Vice President. In an interview with the <a href="http://https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgerg7z9vwro ">BBC</a>, Mr Simmons stated that Harris is a force to be reckoned with, whether she is supporting Biden or leading the ticket herself. “She is somebody, whom Republicans and the Trump campaign need to take seriously,” he said.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Republicans are also acknowledging Kamala Harris' potential to succeed Joe Biden, with Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC) saying that a Harris nomination would mean a "dramatically different race," characterising her as a "vigorous" candidate.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russia blasted the main children's hospital in Kyiv with a missile in broad daylight on Monday and rained missiles down on other cities across Ukraine, killing at least 41 civilians in the deadliest wave of air strikes for months.</p>

<p>Parents holding babies walked in the street outside the hospital, dazed and sobbing after the rare daylight aerial attack. Windows had been smashed and panels ripped off, and hundreds of Kyiv residents were helping to clear debris.</p>

<p>"It was scary. I couldn't breathe, I was trying to cover (my baby). I was trying to cover him with this cloth so that he could breathe," Svitlana Kravchenko, 33, told Reuters.</p>

<p>President Volodymyr Zelensky, who stopped in Poland before heading off to Washington for a NATO summit, put the death count at 37, including three children. More than 170 were injured.</p>

<p>But tallies of casualties from the sites of attacks in different regions totalled at least 41.</p>

</div>

<p>Writing on the Telegram messaging app, Zelensky said more than 100 buildings had been damaged, including the children's hospital and a maternity centre in Kyiv, children's nurseries and a business centre and homes.</p>

<p>"The Russian terrorists must answer for this," he wrote. "Being concerned does not stop terror. Condolences are not a weapon."</p>

<p>The Interior Ministry said there had also been damage in the central cities of Kryvyi Rih and Dnipro and two eastern cities.</p>

<p>The government proclaimed a day of mourning on Tuesday for one of the worst air attacks of the war, which it said demonstrated that Ukraine urgently needed an upgrade of its air defences from its Western allies.</p>

<p>Air defences shot down 30 of 38 missiles, the air force said.</p>

<p>An online video obtained by Reuters showed a missile falling towards the children's hospital followed by a large explosion. The location of the video was verified from visible landmarks.</p>

<p>The Security Service of Ukraine identified the missile as an Kh-101 cruise missile.</p>

<p>Kyiv's military authorities said 27 people had died in the capital, including three children, and 82 were wounded in the main missile volley and a strike that came two hours later.</p>

<h2><strong>Damage Across The Capital</strong></h2>

<p>Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said the attack was one of the largest of the war, causing damage in seven city districts. The Health Minister said five units of the children's hospital were damaged and children were evacuated to other facilities.</p>

<p>Eleven were confirmed dead in the Dnipropetrovsk region and 68 were wounded, regional officials said. Three people were killed in the eastern town of Pokrovsk where missiles hit an industrial facility, the governor said.</p>

<p>Zelensky, addressing a news conference in Warsaw alongside Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, called on Kyiv's Western allies to give a firm response to the attack.</p>

</div>

<p>"We will retaliate against these people, we will deliver a powerful response from our side to Russia, for sure. The question to our partners is: can they respond?" Zelensky said.</p>

<p>The attack came a day before leaders of NATO countries were due to begin a three-day summit, with the war in Ukraine one of the focuses.</p>

<p>US President Joe Biden said that Moscow's deadly missile strikes in Ukraine, including on the children's hospital in Kyiv, were "a horrific reminder of Russia's brutality".</p>

<p>In a statement released by the White House, Biden added that Washington and its NATO allies would be announcing new measures to strengthen Ukraine's air defences.</p>

<p>Diplomats said the United Nations Security Council would meet on Tuesday at the request of Britain, France, Ecuador, Slovenia and the United States.</p>

</div>

<p>The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker T~CHECK~rk, deplored the attacks, saying: "Among the victims were Ukraine's sickest children."</p>

<p>Russia's Defence Ministry said its forces had launched strikes on defence industry targets and aviation bases.</p>

<p>Moscow has repeatedly denied targeting civilians and civilian infrastructure, although its attacks have killed thousands of civilians since it launched its invasion in February 2022.</p>

<p>Ukraine's Prosecutor General said he discussed the attacks with International Criminal Court Prosecutor Karim Khan, adding that his office would be sharing evidence with the ICC.</p>

<p>Ukraine's Defence Minister Rustem Umerov said Ukraine still lacked enough air defences and urged Kyiv's allies to supply more systems promptly to protect cities from Russian attacks.</p>

<p>Air Force representative Colonel Yuri Ignat said it became more difficult to repel Russian attacks as Moscow's forces kept enhancing their bombardment tactics.</p>

<p>"Enemy missiles are equipped with additional means, including radar and thermal traps," Ignat wrote on Facebook.</p>

<p>The missiles flew at extremely low altitudes during Monday's attacks, he said.</p>

<p>DTEK, the largest private power producer, said three electricity substations and networks had been damaged in Kyiv.</p>

<p>The power system has already sustained so much damage from targeted Russian air strikes that began in March that electricity cuts have become widespread.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recent satellite imagery shows major expansions at two key Iranian ballistic missile facilities that two American researchers assessed are for boosting missile production, a conclusion confirmed by three senior Iranian officials.</p>

<p>The enlargement of the sites follows an October 2022 deal in which Iran agreed to provide missiles to Russia, which has been seeking them for its war against Ukraine. Tehran also supplies missiles to Yemen's Houthi rebels and the Lebanese militia Hezbollah, both members of the Iran-backed Axis of Resistance against Israel, according to U.S. officials.</p>

<p>Images taken by commercial satellite firm Planet Labs of the Modarres military base in March and the Khojir missile production complex in April show more than 30 new buildings at the two sites, both of which are located near Tehran.</p>

<p>The images, reviewed by Reuters, show many of the structures are surrounded by large dirt berms. Such earthworks are associated with missile production and are designed to stop a blast in one building from detonating highly combustible materials in nearby structures, said Jeffrey Lewis of the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey.</p>

<p>The expansions began at Khojir in August last year and at Modarres in October, Lewis said, based on images of the sites.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Iran's arsenal is already the largest in the Middle East, estimated at more than 3,000 missiles, including models designed to carry conventional and nuclear warheads, experts say.</p>

<p>Three Iranian officials, who asked not to be identified because they were not authorized to speak publicly, confirmed that Modarres and Khojir are being expanded to boost production of conventional ballistic missiles.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Why shouldn't we?" said one official.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A second Iranian official said some of the new buildings would also allow a doubling of drone manufacturing. Drones and missile components would be sold to Russia, drones would be provided to the Houthis and missiles to Hezbollah, the source added.</p>

<p>Reuters was unable independently to confirm the Iranian officials' comments.</p>

<p>Iran's mission to the United Nations did not respond to a Reuters request for comment on the expansion of the complexes. Tehran has previously denied providing drones and missiles to Russia and the Houthis. Hezbollah's media office did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p>

<p>Houthi spokesperson Mohammed Abdulsalam said a boost in Iran's weapons manufacturing would not have any impact in Yemen because the Houthis develop and manufacture aircraft independent of Iran.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Lewis analyzed the Planet Labs imagery with Decker Eveleth, an associate research analyst at CNA, a Washington thinktank, as part of a Middlebury project that monitors Iranian missile infrastructure.</p>

<p>"We know that Russia is on the hunt for low-cost missile capabilities, and it has gone to Iran and North Korea," said Lewis.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Moscow and Pyongyang&nbsp;have denied the transfer of North Korean missiles to Russia. The Russian embassy in Washington and North Korea's mission to the United Nations did not immediately respond to requests for comment for this story.</p>

<p>The two U.S. researchers said in separate interviews that it was not clear from the photos what kinds of missiles would be produced at the new facilities, which still appeared to be under construction.</p>

<p>Any increase in Tehran's missile or drone production would be concerning to the United States, which has said that Iranian drones help sustain Russia's assault on Ukrainian cities, and to Israel as it fends off attacks from Iran-backed groups, including Hezbollah.</p>

<p>The U.S. Office of the Director of National Intelligence declined to comment on the reseachers' analysis.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A U.S. National Security Council spokesperson declined to confirm their assessment, adding that the United States has implemented various measures, including sanctions, intended to constrain Iranian missile and drone production and exports.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Reuters in February reported that Iran had sent surface-to-surface ballistic missiles to Russia for use against Ukraine. Iran denied providing the weapons. Washington said it could not confirm the transfers but it assumed Tehran intended to provide missiles to Moscow.</p>

<p><strong>NEW BUILDINGS, DIRT BERMS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Shahid Modarres and Khojir are overseen by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), the elite paramilitary organization that plays a central role in Iran's missile and nuclear programs. It controls large segments of the Iranian economy and answers directly to Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.</p>

<p>The complexes have long been associated with the development and production of Iran's short- and medium-range ballistic missiles and rockets for the country's space program.</p>

<p>On Nov. 12, 2011, a massive explosion destroyed a large swath of Shadid Modarres associated with solid fuel missiles, killing 17 IRGC officers. They included Gen. Hassan Moqaddam, regarded by Iran as the "architect" of its ballistic missile program.</p>

<p>Construction at Shahid Modarres, which began again after the 2011 explosion, accelerated last year, the second Iranian official said.</p>

<p>"I think the Iranians may have chosen not to berm the buildings (before the explosion) because they didn't want to draw attention to them," said Lewis. "They learned the hard way."</p>

<p>Eveleth and Lewis said the sites' long history with Iran's missile program – Shahid Modarres is considered by some experts as its birthplace - and the numerous dirt berms support their assessment that Tehran is expanding ballistic missile production.</p>

<p>"When we see where you basically have an entire production line that is bermed like that, that's usually missiles," said Eveleth.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An Indian-origin Singaporean bar owner was sentenced to jail for 13 years and four weeks on Monday and will receive nine strokes of the cane for raping a runaway 17-year-old girl after allowing her to work for him.</p>

<p>Raj Kumar Bala, 42, was convicted of a charge each of raping and molesting the victim and pleaded guilty to a third charge of harbouring a runaway under the Children and Young Persons Act, Channel News Asia reported.</p>

<p>Defence lawyer Ramesh Tiwary said his client has asked to be released on bail pending appeal, according to the channel's report.</p>

<p>The court heard that the victim was 17 in February 2020 when she ran away from the Singapore Girls' Home.</p>

<p>She found out about a job opportunity at Bala's Don Bar and Bistro in Dunlop Street in the Little India precinct of hotels, motels and eateries through another runaway who was working there.</p>

<p>The other runaway was also sexually assaulted by Bala in a charge that stood down for the time being.</p>

<p>The victim went down to the bar to interview for the job and met Bala, who described the job duties to her, including serving customers and making drinks.</p>

<p>He offered her the role, saying she could stay at the bar with other runaways.</p>

<p>The victim worked at the bar for a few days, but police received a tip-off about people who absconded and worked there. They raided the place in the early hours of February 22, 2020.</p>

<p>The victim fled with another girl to escape the raid, before being picked up by Bala.</p>

<p>He drove them to his condominium, telling them they could stay there, before drinking alcohol with the girls.</p>

<p>He raped the victim while she was heavily intoxicated and also engaged in sex acts with the other girl.</p>

<p>The victim left the condo and surrendered herself to the home in July 2020, but told her case worker only in August 2020 that she was raped.</p>

<p>Justice Mavis Chionh noted the "considerable personal harm" inflicted on the victim, who blames herself as to how she came to be in an intoxicated state that led to her rape.</p>

<p>Her testimony in court, which was corroborated by her former boyfriend, illustrated how the trauma from her past would be revived in a way that negatively affects her well-being, the judge noted.</p>

<p>She said Bala knew that the victim was young and on the run from police, and she was dependent on him for income and shelter.</p>

<p>Bala faces other pending charges and is yet to make a decision on what he intends to do with them, according to the report.</p>

<p>The bar owner faces 22 more charges relating to five other victims, mainly for sex offences, according to a report by "The Straits Times". These charges are pending in court.</p>

<p>He is accused of raping and molesting a victim identified in court documents as B1, raping and sexually assaulting a victim identified as B5 and raping, molesting and threatening another victim identified as B6.</p>

<p>He is also accused of sexually penetrating a minor under the age of 16, identified as B7, and molesting and causing alarm to another victim, identified as B8.

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;India is a strategic partner with whom it engages in a full and frank dialogue, the United States said on Monday as Prime Minister Narendra Modi held a bilateral meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow.</p>

<p>"India is a strategic partner with whom we engage in a full and frank dialogue. And that includes our concerns about their relationship with Russia," State Department Spokesperson Matthew Miller said.</p>

<p>He was responding to questions on PM Modi's Moscow visit for bilateral talks with Putin.</p>

<p>"We did just see Modi, like (Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor) Orban, meet with (Ukrainian) President (Volodymyr) Zelenskyy. We thought that was an important step to take. And we would urge India, as we do any country when it engages with Russia, to make clear that any resolution to the conflict in Ukraine needs to be one that respects the UN charter, that respects Ukraine's territorial integrity, Ukraine's sovereignty," Miller said.</p>

<p>"I will look to Prime Minister Modi's public remarks to see what he talked about. But as I said, we made quite clear directly with India our concerns about their relationship with Russia. So we would hope India and any other country, when they engage with Russia, would make clear that Russia should respect the UN charter, should respect Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity," he said in response to a question.</p>

<p>Putin on Monday night welcomed PM Modi at his official residence at Novo-Ogaryovo for a "private engagement" during which he praised the visiting Indian leader for the work he has done for the country's progress.</p>

<p>This is PM Modi's first trip to Russia since its invasion of Ukraine more than two years ago.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[UN humanitarians have said 90 per cent of Gazans were displaced, some multiple times, as more evacuations were ordered and poor or no security hampers aid and fuel deliveries.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>UN humanitarians have said 90 per cent of Gazans were displaced, some multiple times, as more evacuations were ordered and poor or no security hampers aid and fuel deliveries.</p>

<p>The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said on Monday that the Israeli military instructed on Sunday and Monday tens of thousands of people living in 19 blocs of apartments in Gaza City to evacuate immediately.</p>

<p>On Sunday, some residents were ordered to evacuate to western Gaza City, while the order on Monday included areas that people had fled to a day earlier and instructed them to evacuate to shelters in Deir al Balah, Xinhua news agency reported.</p>

<p>"The two directly affected areas encompass 13 health facilities that were recently functional, including two hospitals, two primary healthcare centres and nine medical points," OCHA said, adding that 13 out of 36 hospitals in the Gaza Strip are only partially functional.</p>

<p>The office said that with nine out of every 10 people estimated to be displaced in Gaza, new waves of displacement are mainly affecting people who have already been displaced multiple times, only to find themselves forced to flee again under shelling. They were forced to reset their lives repeatedly without any of their belongings or any prospect of finding safety or reliable access to essential services.</p>

<p>"People, especially children, spend long hours queueing to collect water each day," OCHA said.</p>

<p>"Access to emergency health care is also a challenge, particularly given limited communications coverage to contact emergency services, high transportation costs to reach hospitals ($26 roundtrip) and the long walking distance of at least 3 km to reach the nearest medical point."</p>

<p>In northern Gaza, the aid partners especially highlighted the lack of safe shelters for up to 80,000 IDPs (Internally Displaced Persons) who were forced to hastily flee from Shuja'iyeh and other parts of eastern Gaza City following evacuation orders in late June. Many were found sleeping amid solid waste and rubble, with no mattresses or enough clothing, and some had sought shelter in partially destroyed UN facilities and residential buildings.</p>

<p>The Israeli military designated these same areas as evacuation zones, forcing many of the same families, including young children and the elderly, to go through successive waves of displacement over the past two weeks, the office said.</p>

<p>OCHA said that insecurity, damaged roads, the breakdown of law and order, and access limitations continue to hamper movement along the main humanitarian cargo route between Kerem Shalom crossing and Khan Younis and Deir al Balah.</p>

<p>"This has resulted in critical shortages of fuel and aid commodities to sustain humanitarian operations, in addition to increasing the risk of spoilage and infestation of stranded supplies (especially food) due to extremely high temperatures," the office added.</p>

<p>The humanitarians said the Food Security Sector (FSS) reports that the shortages forced partners to provide reduced food rations in central and southern Gaza in June and undermined their ability to keep bakeries and community kitchens running.</p>

<p>According to OCHA, only seven out of the 18 bakeries supported by humanitarian partners remain operational in Gaza, all in Deir al Balah, and six bakeries already working at partial capacity have now been forced to completely cease operations due to the lack of fuel.</p>

<p>The office said that in the absence of cooking gas and a stable flow of food supplies, community kitchens are also struggling to operate, resulting in a reduced number of cooked meals prepared throughout Gaza.</p>

<p>As of the end of June, about 600,000 cooked meals prepared in 190 kitchens were distributed daily to families across the strip, compared to more than 700,000 in the first half of June.</p>

<p>OCHA said it meant that displaced households rely on burning wood and plastic from furniture and waste to cook, exacerbating health risks and environmental hazards.</p>

<p>As for cooking, humanitarian partners said they continue to distribute wheat flour and canned food that enter northern Gaza through the Erez West crossing. No commercial trucks have been entering the area for months.</p>

<p>A joint assessment by the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation and the UN Satellite Centre estimated that about 57 per cent of Gaza's cropland and one-third of its greenhouses were damaged.</p>

<p>The FSS reported a near-total lack of protein sources, such as meat and poultry, on the local market, and only a few types of locally produced vegetables are available at unaffordable prices.</p>

<p>The sector reported that continued military operations in Rafah and recent displacement from eastern Khan Younis, where significant agricultural production was concentrated before the war, have resulted in additional damage to greenhouses. It forced more people to leave their farms unattended, further destabilising food systems.</p>

<p>OCHA said that on Friday, Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) reported that its teams at Nasser Medical Complex were "running on emergency medical stocks" and all departments were overwhelmed by patients, far exceeding the available bed capacity.</p>

<p>MSF said the Nasser Medical Complex is the main site on which field hospitals rely to sterilise their equipment, and if the facility is left without electricity, several field hospitals will also cease functioning.</p>

<p>It said the hospital has been unable to bring any medical supplies into Gaza since the end of April, including most recently on Wednesday, when the Israeli authorities denied trucks carrying MSF medical aid entry into the Gaza Strip due to ongoing hostilities.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>TikTok has released its Community Guidelines Enforcement Report for the first quarter of 2024, revealing that it took action against 20.2 million videos in Pakistan alone for violating its community guidelines, Ary News reported.</p>

<p>The platform removed 66,997,307 videos worldwide during the January-March period of 2024, representing about 0.9 per cent of all uploaded content.</p>

<p>The majority of these removals were made possible through automated detection technologies, with a significant number of videos later reinstated upon review, as per ARY News.</p>

<p>A substantial portion of these, 129,335,793 videos, were identified and removed through automated detection technologies, while 6,042,287 videos were reinstated upon further review, according to TikTok Q1 2024 Community Guidelines Enforcement Report.</p>

<p>TikTok has taken steps to increase transparency by releasing new data on its content moderation efforts.</p>

<p>For the first time, the platform has disclosed the number of comments removed and filtered by its safety tools, revealing that nearly 976,479,946 comments were removed or filtered during the first quarter of 2024.</p>

<p>Additionally, TikTok has cracked down on spam accounts, implementing measures to prevent the spread of automated spam content and further improving its content moderation practices.</p>

<p>Notably, approximately 93.9 per cent of videos that violated the guidelines were removed within 24 hours of posting, and the proactive removal rate for the quarter stood impressively at 99.8 per cent globally.</p>

<p>In a global effort to safeguard younger users, TikTok also deleted 21,639,414 accounts suspected of belonging to individuals under the age of 13.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Israeli army said Monday that it had struck "several terrorists" in central Gaza who were allegedly using a school in the Nuseirat area as "cover".</p>

<p>"A short while ago, based on intelligence and using precise munition, the IAF struck several terrorists who were conducting terrorist activities, using the structures of a school in the area of Nuseirat as cover," the army said in a statement, referring to the Israeli Air Force.</p>

<p>A source at the Al-Awda hospital in Nuseirat told AFP that it had received several wounded people for treatment after an attack against a school run by the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA.</p>

<p>Israel's army said Hamas and Islamic Jihad "systematically violate international law, exploiting civilian structures and population as human shields for terror attacks against the State of Israel".</p>

<p>On Saturday the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza said 16 people were killed in an Israeli strike on a school housing displaced people in Nuseirat.</p>

<p>At the time, the army said its aircraft had targeted "terrorists" operating around the Al-Jawni school in Nuseirat, which is run by UNRWA.</p>

<p>The war in Gaza entered its 10th month on Sunday.</p>

<p>The conflict erupted with Hamas's October 7 attack on southern Israel that resulted in the deaths of 1,195 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.</p>

<p>The militants seized 251 hostages, 116 of whom remain in Gaza, including 42 the military says are dead.</p>

<p>Israel responded with a military offensive that has killed at least 38,193 people in Gaza, also mostly civilians, according to data from the territory's health ministry.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;US President Joe Biden has vowed he will be "running this race to end "of the November election, despite private calls from Democrats to drop out.</p>

<p>Biden stood firm and told congressional Democrats in a letter on Monday that he would continue his election bid despite mounting concerns about his mental fitness.</p>

<p>Biden said that he wouldn't be running again, "if I did not absolutely believe that I could beat Donald Trump."</p>

<p>"I want you to know that despite all the speculation in the press and elsewhere, I am firmly committed to staying in this race, to running this race to the end, and to beating Donald Trump," he added.</p>

<p>Further, he also stated, "We have 42 days to the Democratic convention and 119 days to the general election," Biden said in the letter distributed by his reelection campaign</p>

<p>In the letter, Biden calls for unity among his party, emphasising the need for a collective effort to defeat former President Donald Trump in the upcoming election.</p>

<p>"Any weakening of resolve or lack of clarity about the task ahead only helps Trump and hurts us. It's time to come together, move forward as a unified party, and defeat Donald Trump," said Biden.<br />
The letter comes after a group call with House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, in which four congressmen were explicit in urging Biden to step aside some deep-pocketed donors have also reportedly expressed discomfort, with Hollywood's Rob Reiner, who regularly donates to Democratic candidates, saying he thinks Biden should step aside "we lose our democracy if Trump wins."</p>

<p>At the same time, some of the president's biggest supporters are re-doubling the fight for Biden's presidency, insisting there is no better way to beat Trump in what many see as among the most important elections of a lifetime.</p>

<p>On Sunday, a leadership call was organised by House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, where several top House Democrats are urging President Joe Biden to step aside from the 2024 campaign, expressing deep concerns about his potential impact on the Democratic Party's chances in the upcoming elections.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;U.S. President Joe Biden will hold his first face-to-face talks with Britain's new Prime Minister Keir Starmer at the White House on Wednesday, the White House said on Monday.</p>

<p>Biden also will host an event on Thursday with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy at the NATO summit, which is taking place this week in Washington, national security spokesperson John Kirby told reporters.</p>

<p>Biden plans to "underscore the importance of continuing to strengthen the special relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom" in his meeting with Starmer, White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement.</p>

<p>She said the two leaders would have the opportunity to discuss U.S.-UK cooperation across a range of issues from Ukraine to the Israel-Gaza war, and ensuring that Iran does not obtain nuclear weapons, as well as confronting Iranian-backed Houthi threats to commercial shipping.</p>

<p>The leaders also will discuss furthering cooperation in areas such as protecting advanced technologies and developing climate and clean energy solutions.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>U.S. President Joe Biden is not being treated for Parkinson's disease, the White House said on Monday, after reports surfaced that a doctor specializing in the malady had visited the White House eight times over the past year.</p>

<p>Concerns that the president might be suffering from an undisclosed illness have risen since Biden's stumbled in his June 27 debate with Republican Donald Trump.</p>

<p>The New York Times said White House visitor logs show that Dr. Kevin Cannard, a neurologist who specializes in movement disorders and recently published a paper on Parkinson's, visited the White House eight times from last summer through the spring of this year.</p>

<p>During an acrimonious briefing, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre refused to confirm Cannard's visit, saying she wanted to respect the privacy of all involved for security reasons.</p>

<p>She said Biden had seen a neurologist three times connected to Biden's annual physical exams.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iran's president-elect Masoud Pezeshkian on Monday reaffirmed the Islamic republic's support for Lebanon's Hezbollah group and condemned Israel's actions against Palestinians.</p>

<p>The statement, issued to Hezbollah's chief Hassan Nasrallah on the IRNA official news agency, was one of the first foreign policy comments from Pezeshkian since his victory in Friday's presidential election runoff.</p>

<p>Tehran provides financial and military support to Hezbollah, which was created at the initiative of Iran's Revolutionary Guards after arch-foe Israel overran Beirut in 1982 during Lebanon's civil war.</p>

<p>In a reference to Hezbollah and allied groups, Pezeshkian said: "The support of the resistance is rooted in the fundamental policies of the Islamic Republic of Iran."</p>

<p>He said he was confident the "resistance movement" would stop its arch-foe Israel's "warmongering and criminal policies" in Gaza, where Israel has for nine months been at war with Hezbollah's Palestinian ally, Hamas.</p>

<p>Since the war in Gaza began, Hezbollah and Israel have exchanged near-daily fire over Lebanon's border, triggering global alarm about the potential for all-out war as fighting escalates.</p>

<p>Earlier Monday, Iran's foreign ministry spokesman Nasser Kanani said Tehran "will not hesitate to support the Lebanese nation" and Israel "must be aware of the consequences of any adventurous action in the region, especially towards Lebanon."</p>

<p>Reformist Pezeshkian defeated ultraconservative Saeed Jalili, a former nuclear negotiator, in the election which was brought forward after the death of president Ebrahim Raisi in a helicopter crash.</p>

<p>After the vote, Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz said the election result was a "clear message of demand for change and opposition" from the Iranian people.</p>

<p>On Saturday Nasrallah congratulated Pezeshkian on his election victory and emphasised Tehran's role as a "strong" supporter of regional "resistance" groups.</p>

<p>The Shiite Muslim movement is a key part of the Axis of Resistance -- an alliance of pro-Iran armed movements that oppose Israel and the United States.</p>

<p>The alliance also includes Yemen's Huthi rebels and fighters in Iraq, as well as Hamas.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United States called Monday on Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to emphasize Ukraine's territorial integrity as he met in Russia with President Vladimir Putin on the eve of a NATO summit in Washington.</p>

<p>"We would urge India, as we do any country which engages with Russia, to make clear that any resolution to the conflict in Ukraine needs to be one that respects the UN Charter with respect to Ukraine's territorial integrity, Ukraine's sovereignty," State Department spokesman Matthew Miller told reporters.</p>

<p>"India is a strategic partner with whom we engage in a full and frank dialogue, and that includes on our concerns about the relationship with Russia," he said.</p>

<p>Miller said, however, that he was unaware of specific conversations with India about PM Modi's visit to Russia.</p>

<p>The United States has built strong relations with India, seeing it as a powerful partner in the face of the rise of China, with President Joe Biden inviting PM Modi for a state visit a year ago.</p>

<p>India has a longstanding relationship with Moscow dating to the Cold War and has refused to join Western sanctions over the Ukraine war, instead turning to Russia for discounted energy imports.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

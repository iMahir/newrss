       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Billionaire X owner Elon&nbsp;Musk&nbsp;was facing&nbsp;criticism&nbsp;Monday for sharing a&nbsp;deepfake&nbsp;video&nbsp;featuring US Vice President&nbsp;Kamala&nbsp;Harris, which tech campaigners said violated the platform's own policies.</p>

<p>Musk&nbsp;reposted a manipulated&nbsp;Harris&nbsp;campaign&nbsp;video&nbsp;in which a voiceover mimicking her calls President Joe Biden senile, and declares that she does not "know the first thing about running the country," adding that as a woman and a person of color, she is the "ultimate diversity hire.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;video&nbsp;was originally posted by an X account linked to the conservative podcaster Chris Kohls and labeled a "parody."</p>

<p>But&nbsp;Musk's repost on Friday made no such disclosure, stating only: "This is amazing," along with a laughing emoji.</p>

<p>Musk's repost garnered more than 130 million views and comes amid growing alarm&nbsp;over&nbsp;AI-enabled political disinformation ahead of the US presidential election in November.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We believe the American people want the real freedom, opportunity, and security Vice President&nbsp;Harris&nbsp;is offering; not the fake, manipulated lies of Elon&nbsp;Musk&nbsp;and Donald Trump,"&nbsp;Harris's presidential campaign said in a statement.</p>

<p>With nearly 192 million followers,&nbsp;Musk&nbsp;is a highly influential voice on the platform, previously called Twitter, which he purchased in 2022 in a $44 billion deal.</p>

<p>Earlier this month,&nbsp;Musk&nbsp;endorsed Trump&nbsp;in a post on X shortly after the Republican narrowly escaped an assassination attempt during a campaign rally in Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>Gavin Newsom, the Democratic governor of California, posted on X that the manipulated&nbsp;Harris&nbsp;video&nbsp;"should be illegal" and that he would soon sign a bill banning such media.</p>

<p>A defiant&nbsp;Musk&nbsp;responded to his post, saying "parody is legal in America," while including the original&nbsp;video&nbsp;below it.</p>

<p>Musk's repost appeared to violate X's policies, which prohibit sharing "synthetic, manipulated or out-of-context media that may deceive or confuse people and lead to harm."</p>

<p>X did not respond to AFP's request for comment.</p>

<p>"Ignoring the rules of the road (because) he bought the road," Nora Benavidez, senior counsel at the watchdog Free Press, wrote on X, referring to&nbsp;Musk's apparent violation of the site's policies.</p>

<p>Disinformation researchers are fearful of rampant misuse of AI technology in a major election year, thanks to proliferating online tools that are cheap and easy to use while lacking sufficient guardrails.</p>

<p>AI-generated content -- particularly audio, which experts say is difficult to identify -- sparked national alarm in January when a fake robocall posing as Biden urged New Hampshire residents not to vote in the state's primary.</p>

<p>"Platforms play an outsized role in election cycles," Benavidez wrote. "They must do better."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The Quad foreign ministers have reinforced their call for concerted international action against Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Tayyiba (LeT), Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM), as well as Al-Qa'ida and the Islamic State outfit.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Warning against terrorists deploying new technologies, the Quad foreign ministers have reinforced their call for concerted international action against Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Tayyiba (LeT), Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM), as well as Al-Qa'ida and the Islamic State outfit.</p>

<p>After their meeting in Tokyo, the Quad ministers said in a joint statement on Monday that they were committed to working with international and regional partners to forestall "threats posed by the use of new and emerging technologies for terrorist purposes".</p>

<p>"We reiterate the call for concerted action against all UN-listed terrorist groups including Al-Qa'ida, ISIS/Daesh, Lashkar-e-Tayyiba (LeT), Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM), and their proxy groups," External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Foreign Ministers Penny Wong of Australia and Yoko Kamikawa of Japan said in their statement.</p>

<p>"We deplore the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), drones, tunnels, and information and communication technologies by terrorists and terrorist entities," they said.</p>

<p>Recalling the 26/11 Mumbai and the 2016 Pathankot terrorist attacks, they called for "bringing the perpetrators of these attacks to justice without delay".</p>

<p>The ministers said the first meeting of the Quad Working Group on Counter-Terrorism established at the ministerial meeting in New Delhi last year had "fruitful discussions" at its first meeting and at the fourth tabletop exercise in Honolulu in December, and added that they looked forward to next exercise to be hosted by Japan in November.</p>

<p>The tabletop exercises look at scenarios to develop responses to an overwhelming terrorist incident in the Indo-Pacific region.</p>

<p>The 4,000-word joint statement ran the gamut from the conflicts in Ukraine and Palestine, and China's regional threats to cooperation on undersea cable connectivity and environment.</p>

<p>On Ukraine, where there are differences in nuances between India and the other three Quad partners who are all in on aiding Kiev, the statement said unequivocally, "We reiterate the need for a comprehensive, just, and lasting peace in line with international law, consistent with the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, including respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity."</p>

<p>India reiterating, this time in this forum, its joint commitment to upholding international law and the UN Charter in Ukraine comes days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Moscow which drew criticism from the West and Ukraine and underlined its independent stand on international relations.</p>

<p>The joint statement did not name Russia.</p>

<p>The ministers' statement made pointed references to the dangers to regional peace and security posed by China, but again, without naming it.</p>

<p>They reiterated their fundamental "steadfast commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific, which is inclusive and resilient, and are united in our commitment to upholding the free and open rules-based international order".</p>

<p>They called for upholding "sovereignty and territorial integrity, and peaceful settlement of disputes and prohibition on the threat or use of force in accordance with the UN Charter", while also committing to "the principle of freedom, human rights, rule of law, (and) democratic values".</p>

<p>Regarding foreign manipulation through exploitation of the information infrastructure, the four ministers vowed to "leverage our collective expertise and capacity to respond" to those threats.</p>

<p>They warned of "foreign information manipulation and interference, including disinformation, which undermines trust and sows discord in the international community" which are tactics that are "intended to interfere with domestic and international interest".</p>

<p>The ministers said they would promote human rights while "supporting media freedom, addressing online harassment and abuse, and countering unethical practices".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p>

<p>Flights to and from Beirut airport were cancelled or delayed on Monday as tensions escalated between Israel and armed political group Hezbollah after a strike in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights killed 12 children and teenagers.</p>

<p>Air France said on Monday that due to the security situation at the destination, it will suspend flights between Paris-Charles de Gaulle and Beirut for the days of July 29 and 30, 2024.</p>

<p>"Air France is monitoring the situation in Lebanon in real time," the airline said.</p>

<p>Lufthansa, Swiss and Eurowings of the Lufthansa Group have decided to suspend their flights from and to Beirut up to and including Aug. 5 due to the current developments in the Middle East, a group spokesperson said.</p>

<p>Lebanon's Middle East Airlines (MEA) said disruptions to its schedule were related to insurance risks.</p>

<p>The rocket strike in the Golan Heights on Saturday has added to concerns that Israel and the Iran-backed group could engage in a full-scale war.</p>

<p>Israel's security cabinet on Sunday authorised the government to respond to the strike. Hezbollah denied any responsibility for the attack, the deadliest in Israel or Israeli-annexed territory since Hamas' Oct. 7 assault sparked the war in Gaza, which has since spread to several fronts.</p>

<p>Beirut airport's flight information board and flight tracking website Flightradar24 show Turkish Airlines also cancelled two flights overnight on Sunday.</p>

<p>Turkey-based budget carrier SunExpress, Turkish Airlines subsidiary AJet, Greek carrier Aegean Airlines, Ethiopian Air and MEA have also cancelled flights scheduled to land in Beirut on Monday, Flightradar24 shows.</p>

<p>The airlines did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p>

<p>Beirut-Rafic Hariri International Airport is Lebanon's only airport. It has been targeted in the country's civil war, and previous fighting with Israel, including in the last war between Hezbollah and Israel in 2006.</p>

<p>On Sunday, MEA said it had delayed the departure of some flights set to land in Beirut overnight. Additional delays to flights landing on Monday were then announced due to "technical reasons related to the distribution of insurance risks for aircraft between Lebanon and other destinations", MEA said.</p>

<p>Hezbollah and the Israeli military have increased cross-border exchanges of fire since the Gaza war began. The conflict has disrupted flights and shipping across the region, including during reciprocal drone and missile attacks between Israel and Iran in April.</p>

<p>Lufthansa has already suspended night-time flights to and from Beirut for July due to "current developments" in the Middle East.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thousands of firefighters battling a massive northern California wildfire were working in milder temperatures and higher humidity Monday, but the blaze that has destroyed more than 100 structures since it began five days ago continues to grow.</p>

<p>The Park Fire, which officials said was started by a man who pushed a flaming car into a gully, grew slightly overnight to 368,000 acres (148,924 hectares). The sixth largest wildfire in state history is rolling through a remote area some 180 miles (290 km) northeast of San Francisco, according to Cal Fire.</p>

<p>Crews were "still in for quite a firefight today, just because (of) the sheer magnitude and the sheer size of the fire," said Dan Collins, a Cal Fire captain, noting that temperatures were to be in the high 80s with 25% percent humidity during the day.</p>

<p>Some 4,800 firefighters were building and strengthening control lines on Monday morning hoping to increase the 12% they had contained. The more favorable weather conditions compared to those they faced over the past several days were helping, Collins added.</p>

<p>Butte County District Attorney Mike Ramsey said in a statement that the accused arson suspect, Ronnie Dean Stout II, was jailed without bond on a Butte County judge's warrant after he was identified as the person seen pushing a flaming car into a gully on Wednesday afternoon.</p>

<p>The fire rapidly grew, doubling in size from Friday to Sunday and destroying at least 114 structures in four counties.</p>

<p>The fire has also caused officials to issue evacuation warnings and orders to several communities, including Paradise, the town that was devastated by the 2018 Camp Fire, the deadliest in the state's history.</p>

<p>Cal Fire also reported on Monday that 33% of the SQF Lightning Complex was contained. That fire has raged for the past two weeks some 350 miles (563 km) to the south of the Park Fire. Part of that complex, dubbed the Borel Fire, swept through Havilah, torching much of that historic gold mining town on Friday.</p>

<p>The Park and Borel fires were just two of the 102 large active fires burning nationwide. A total of 25 had forced evacuations as of Monday morning, according to the National Interagency Fire Center.</p>

<p>A cold front in the Pacific Northwest, where many of the fires burn, was forecast to bring rain and thunderstorms to the region on Monday. However, the system will carry strong wind gusts of up to 50 miles (80 km) per hour that could hamper firefighting efforts, the center said in a statement.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who on Monday visited the site of a deadly attack in the annexed Golan Heights, vowed Israel would deliver a "severe response" to the rocket fire that killed 12 children.</p>

<p>"Like all Israeli citizens, and I must say like many around the world, we were deeply shaken by this horrific killing," Netanyahu said at the site of the attack, according to a statement issued by his office.</p>

<p>"These children are our children ... The State of Israel will not, and cannot, let this pass. Our response will come and it will be severe."</p>

<p>Scores of residents of Majdal Shams protested at Netanyahu's visit which came after the last of the victim was buried on Monday, with hundreds of Druze men and women gathering for the funeral, an AFP journalist reported.</p>

<p>Many residents of Majdal Shams have not accepted Israeli nationality since Israel seized the Golan Heights from Syria in 1967.</p>

<p>The 12 children aged between 10 and 16 were killed on Saturday when a rocket fired from Lebanon struck a football pitch in the Druze Arab town of Majdal Shams where they were playing.</p>

<p>According to the Israeli military, they were hit by an Iranian-made rocket carrying a 50-kilogramme warhead, adding it was fired by Lebanese armed group Hezbollah.</p>

<p>Hezbollah, which has traded regular cross-border fire with Israeli forces since the Gaza war began in early October, has denied responsibility for the strike, though it claimed multiple attacks on Israeli military positions that day.</p>

<p>Hezbollah says its actions against Israeli forces are in support of Palestinians in Gaza and its ally, the Hamas group.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A knife attack in northern England on Monday wounded at least eight people, reportedly including children, emergency services said.</p>

<p>Police said armed officers detained a man and seized a knife after being called to a property in Southport, near Liverpool in northwest England.</p>

<p>"There are a number of reported casualties," police said in a statement.</p>

<p>The North West Ambulance Service (NWAS) said it had "treated eight patients with stab injuries who have been taken to Alder Hey Children's Hospital, Aintree University Hospital and Southport and Formby hospital."</p>

<p>Alder Hey Children's Hospital said: "We can confirm that the trust has declared a major incident."</p>

<p>Local business owner Colin Parry, one of the people who called police, told the domestic Press Association news agency that he believed several "young girls" had been stabbed.</p>

<p>Bare Varathan, who owns a local shop, told PA he saw "seven to 10 kids" who were "injured, bleeding", adding that he saw they had been stabbed.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer called the incident "horrendous and deeply shocking," adding on X, formerly called Twitter, that "my thoughts are with all those affected".</p>

<p>The area where the incident took place is located in a quiet, leafy neighbourhood of residential streets.</p>

<p>Some residents who were allowed to come out from the police cordon sealing it off looked visibly shocked, according to an AFP reporter at the scene.</p>

<p>One man who lives in an adjoining street and did not wish to be named told AFP: "It's not what you expect to see in Southport."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Providing an update on the status of the probe into the July 13 shooting, Federal Bureau of Investigation officials said they have still not determined a motive for the attack by the 20-year-old gunman, Thomas Matthew Crooks.</p>

<p>They said Crooks, who was shot dead by a Secret Service sniper after firing eight shots during Trump's campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, appeared to be a "loner" and they have not identified any co-conspirators.</p>

<p>FBI special agent Kevin Rojek said the interview with Trump will be "a standard victim interview like we would do for any other victim of crime under any other circumstances.</p>

<p>"We want to get his perspective on what he observed," Rojek said.</p>

<p>FBI officials said they have interviewed dozens of people who knew or interacted with Crooks, including family members, co-workers, former teachers, classmates and others.</p>

<p>"We have learned the subject was highly intelligent, attended college and maintained steady employment," Rojek said. "His primary social circle appears to be limited to his immediate family as we believe he had few friends and acquaintances."</p>

<p>The FBI officials said Crooks's parents have said they had no advance knowledge of their son's plot. "We do find that to be credible at this stage," Rojek said.</p>

<p>FBI Director Christopher Wray, testifying before a congressional committee last week, said Crooks had searched online for details about the November 1963 shooting of US president John F. Kennedy by Lee Harvey Oswald.</p>

<p>"On July 6, he did a Google search for, quote, 'How far away was Oswald from Kennedy?'" Wray said.</p>

<p>Rojek said the investigation has revealed that Crooks "also made searches related to power plants, mass shooting events, information on improvised explosive devices and the attempted assassination of the Slovakian prime minister earlier this year."</p>

<p>- 'Suspicious person' -</p>

<p>Crooks was perched on the roof of a nearby building and opened fire on Trump with an AR-style assault rifle shortly after 6:00 pm, as the Republican White House candidate was addressing the rally in Butler.</p>

<p>Trump was wounded in the ear, two rally attendees were seriously injured and a 50-year-old Pennsylvania firefighter was shot dead.</p>

<p>Rojek said Crooks was identified as a "suspicious person" by law enforcement about an hour before the shooting.</p>

<p>"A local officer took a photo of the subject and sent it to other SWAT operators on scene, as well as local command personnel," he said.</p>

<p>SWAT operators observed Crooks about 30 minutes later, shortly after 5:30 pm, using a range finder and browsing news websites on his phone, he said.</p>

<p>At approximately 6:08 pm police dashcam video observed Crooks traversing the roof of the building from where he ultimately fired his shots, Rojek said.</p>

<p>"At approximately 6:11 pm a local police officer was boosted onto the roof by another officer where he encountered the subject," he said.</p>

<p>Crooks pointed his rifle at the officer, who "immediately dropped to the ground," he said. "Approximately 25 to 30 seconds after this encounter, the subject fired eight rounds before being successfully neutralized."</p>

<p>US Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle resigned last week after acknowledging the agency had failed in its mission to prevent the assassination attempt.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Police noticed the Pennsylvania man who tried to assassinate Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump more than an hour before the July 13 shooting and took a photo to share with other law enforcement officers, an FBI official said on Monday.</p>

<p>"The shooter was identified by law enforcement as a suspicious person," Kevin Rojek, the special agent in charge of the FBI's Pittsburgh field office, told reporters at a briefing on the agency's investigation into the assassination attempt.</p>

<p>He said a local officer took a photo of gunman Thomas Crooks and sent it to other law enforcement officials at the scene of Trump's Pennsylvania rally that day. Some 30 minutes later, Rojek said, SWAT team operators saw Crooks using a rangefinder and browsing news sites.</p>

<p>Crooks was seen carrying a backpack around 5:56 p.m., less than 20 minutes before the shooting took place, and at 6:08 p.m. he was caught on a police dashboard camera walking on the roof from where he ultimately fired the shots, Rojek said.</p>

<p>Although the FBI is not the agency responsible for investigating any lapses in Trump's security, FBI personnel are putting together a timeline of events, he said.</p>

<p>FBI officials said they had yet to identify a motive for Crooks, the 20-year-old gunman, who was shot dead by a Secret Service agent after opening fire.</p>

<p>But they said he had conducted online searches on prior mass shooting events, on improvised explosive devices and on the attempted assassination of the Slovakian prime minister in May.</p>

<p>Trump, who has been highly critical of the FBI, has agreed to sit for a standard victim's interview, which "will be consistent with any victim interview we do," Rojek said. "We want to get his perspective."</p>

<p>Rojek confirmed Trump was struck by a bullet, whether "whole or fragmented into smaller pieces."</p>

<p>FBI officials have described Crooks as a loner who had no close friends or acquaintances, with his social circle limited primarily to immediate family members.</p>

<p>Using encrypted applications, he made 25 firearm-related purchases and six chemical precursors used to make explosive devices, FBI officials told reporters.</p>

<p>His longtime interest in science and doing science experiments did not rouse any suspicion by his parents, whom the FBI said have been cooperative with their investigation.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After a year-long legal battle, Iowa became the latest US state to enact a near-total abortion ban on Monday, keeping the charged issue of reproductive rights at the forefront of November's presidential election.</p>

<p>The law prohibits terminating nearly all pregnancies after six weeks -- the point at which a fetal heartbeat can be detected -- even though many women do not realize they are pregnant at this stage.</p>

<p>Previously, abortion was permitted in the Midwestern state up to 20 weeks of gestation.</p>

<p>Initially passed last year and signed into law by Governor Kim Reynolds, the ban was placed on hold by a judge but then reinstated following a narrow 4-3 ruling by the Iowa Supreme Court last month.</p>

<p>"This morning, more than 1.5 million women in Iowa woke up with fewer rights than they had last night because of another Trump Abortion Ban," US Vice President Kamala Harris, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, wrote on X.</p>

<p>Her Republican opponent, former president Donald Trump, appointed three conservative Supreme Court justices who in 2022 helped overturn Roe v. Wade, the landmark decision that had guaranteed a national right to abortion for nearly 50 years.</p>

<p>The Iowa law includes exceptions for cases of rape and incest, as well as situations where the life of the fetus or mother is at risk.</p>

<p>However, in states with similar bans, these exemptions have often proven ineffective, with hospitals and doctors hesitant to risk prosecution, forcing women to seek care out of state.</p>

<p>"Patients will be forced to travel hundreds of miles from home to find abortion care, if they have the means to do so," said Nancy Northup, president of the Center for Reproductive Rights.</p>

<p>"Others will be forced to carry pregnancies to term, regardless of their determination of what is best for their lives, health, families, and future. People with dire pregnancy complications will be turned away from hospitals until they are crashing."</p>

<p><strong>Challenging issue for Republicans</strong></p>

<p>Iowa is now among 22 states that have set stricter standards for abortion since the fall of Roe, ranging from full bans to earlier gestational limits.</p>

<p>Trump carried Iowa by more than eight points in 2020, and is expected to win handily this time around too.</p>

<p>Still, the topic of abortion remains challenging for Republicans, who must navigate the risk of alienating independent and moderate voters.</p>

<p>A March poll by the Des Moines Register/Mediacom found that 61 percent of Iowans believe abortion should be legal in all or most cases, while 35 percent believe it should be illegal in most or all cases -- a trend consistent with national polling.</p>

<p>Democrats, on the other hand, have been energized by President Joe Biden's decision to withdraw from the race in favor of Harris, long seen as the administration's true champion of reproductive rights.</p>

<p>"I don't think people fully understand just how angry women are about Roe being overturned -- Harris has the ability to drive that home," feminist author Jessica Valenti, who runs "Abortion, Every Day" on Substack, told AFP recently.</p>

<p>Polling by YouGov released last week found Harris enjoying a 12-point advantage over Trump on abortion, significantly higher than the five-point lead Biden held over Trump in early July.</p>

<p>On the Republican side, Trump's running mate J.D. Vance has made the divide between the two parties even starker, expressing a desire to make abortion "illegal nationally," voting against protections for in vitro fertilization, and likening abortion to "slavery."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former British TV news presenter Huw Edwards, a household name in Britain, has been charged with three counts of making indecent pictures of children, police said on Monday.</p>

<p>Edwards, 62, was the BBC's highest paid news presenter and anchored the broadcaster's "BBC News at Ten" bulletin for more than two decades. He resigned in April.</p>

<p>He has been charged with three counts of making an indecent photograph or pseudo-photograph of a child relating to images found on a child's phone, according to court documents.</p>

<p>"The offences, which are alleged to have taken place between December 2020 and April 2022, relate to images shared on a WhatsApp chat," a London police spokesperson said.</p>

<p>"Edwards was arrested on 8 November, 2023. He was charged on Wednesday, 26 June following authorisation from the Crown Prosecution Service."</p>

<p>He was bailed to appear at London's Westminster Magistrates' Court on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Edwards was one of the main faces at the BBC until his departure, announcing the death of Queen Elizabeth to the nation, and leading coverage of the biggest events in Britain since the turn of the century, including elections, royal weddings and the 2012 Olympics.</p>

<p>He quit on medical advice after allegations emerged that he had paid a young person thousands of pounds for sexually explicit photos.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A 42-year-old Belgian tourist suffered third-degree burns after losing his flip-flops in the dunes of Death Valley.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;A man was rescued after suffering full-thickness burns on his feet at Mesquite Flat Sand Dunes in Death Valley National Park. According to the<em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nps.gov/deva/learn/news/7-20-2024-sand-dunes.htm"> National Park Service</a></em>, the incident happened on&nbsp;July 20 when a 42-year-old Belgian tourist suffered third-degree burns after losing his flip-flops in the dunes of Death Valley.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Park rangers said that the tourist was taking a short walk in the scorching Mesquite Flat Sand Dunes at Death Valley National Park on Saturday. The 42-year-old man was exposed to the blistering 123-degree heat, causing his skin to melt off his foot, according to Park Ranger Gia Ponce. Unable to move due to extreme pain, the man and his family enlisted the help of fellow park visitors to carry him to the parking lot, where rangers assessed his injuries.</p>

<p>Due to the heat-thinned air, helicopters were unable to fly in, so an ambulance transported him to higher ground, where it was cooler (109 degrees), and he was then airlifted to safety.&nbsp;</p>

<p>''People think it's going to be like the beach where you can get out there with flip-flops or sandals, but because of the extreme temperatures, those dunes heat up just as much as the pavement does,” Ms Ponce said.</p>

<p>On a sand dune, the ground temperature is much hotter than in the air. According to the <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/travel/2024/07/24/man-who-lost-flip-flops-death-valley-hospitalized-burned-feet/">Washington Post</a></em>, that's because sand doesn't require much energy to warm up. When the sand's high-density traps that heat, the result is a hot, hot surface.</p>

<p>Park officials recommend walking in the park and its soft dunes only in closed-toe shoes to avoid similar incidents. They also gave some advice to those interested in visiting Death Valley during the heat.&nbsp;</p>

<p>''Park rangers recommend that summer travellers to Death Valley National Park stay within a 10-minute walk of an air-conditioned vehicle, not hike after 10 am, drink plenty of water, eat salty snacks, and wear a hat and sunscreen,'' a release from National Park Service read.</p>

<p>Tensions in the region have escalated following a rocket strike on a soccer field in northern Israel's Majdal Shams on July 27 that resulted in the death of 12 children and injured several others.</p>

<p>Israel and the USA blamed Hezbollah for the air strike with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu saying that Hezbollah will pay a "heavy price which it has not paid up to now" for the attack.</p>

<p>Netanyahu also held a security assessment meeting in Tel Aviv on Sunday during which "the manner and timing of the response" against Hezbollah was decided.</p>

<p>Several flights heading to Beirut have also been suspended over the last couple of days following the Israeli threat of military action against Hezbollah.</p>

<p>US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who was in Tokyo on Monday, also expressed Washington's support for Israel, highlighting Israel's right to self-defence while also urging the need to avoid escalation of the conflict on Israel's northern border.</p>

<p>"We don't want to see the conflict escalate. We don't want to see it spread," Blinken said on the sidelines of the Quad Foreign Ministers Meeting.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Indian Embassy in Beirut shared an emergency mail ID and phone number, asking the Indian nationals in the country to remain in touch.</p>

<p>According to the Indian embassy, there are nearly 4000 Indian nationals in Lebanon, with a majority of them employed as workers in companies, construction sector, agricultural farms, etc.<br />

<p>So what if our team turned up in an eyesore of a formal kit at the opening ceremony of the Paris Olympics? Our shaadi ceremonies are way grander than the show France put up earlier this week. As we say in Delhi, "vibe is better here".</p>

<p>On a serious note, Team India's sartorial ignominy will, disproportionately, remain the defining moment for the country's most important sporting outing in four years. Unless, of course, the shine of medals makes us forget how we repeatedly let our athletes down.&nbsp;<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://sports.ndtv.com/olympics-2024/paris-olympics-2024-live-updates-manu-bhaker-ramita-jindal-olympic-games-paris-2024-day-3-latest-updates-6212322">While shooter Manu Bhaker</a> is being cheered for her bronze, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://sports.ndtv.com/olympics-2024/videos/sharath-kamal-deepika-kumari-and-others-bow-out-paris-olympics-on-day-2-819598">Deepika Kumari</a> has been turned into a villain online after India's archery team lost 0-6 to the Netherlands.</p>

<h2><strong>What The Olympics Represent</strong></h2>

<p>The modern Olympics are important, they have always been, for not just what they present during some weeks but also what they represent before and after the opening and the closing ceremonies. They are scrutinised, overanalysed, politicised, and sometimes even totemised. Terrorist threats emerging around each edition of the games underscore their geopolitical importance. Like their ancient version, the modern Olympics are overburdened with the task of building bridges between countries and cultures. They are a celebration of the indomitable spirit of humanity that burns bright even when countries and cultures stand on the brink of annihilation. The loudest cheers, therefore, are reserved for the contingents marching under the refugee flags, every four years.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Olympics have been serving as an antidote to strife and conflict since ancient times. The Greeks loved to fight. But they also halted their warring business for the games. Even in the middle of the fierceness of the Trojan War in <em>The Iliad</em>, Achilles organises funeral games to honour the memory of Patroclus. Many an observer of the games in both their ancient and modern avatars believe that the Olympics are all about winning. Surely, the hymns of glory in Homer's epic and other classical texts like the odes of Pindar reserved for the winning athletes may foster this idea. Nothing could be further than the truth. The spirit of games, especially the Olympics, was far higher than the podium.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><b>A Question Of Honour</b></h2>

<p>In the ancient Greek culture, the desire for honour, <em>philotimia</em>, and the desire for victory, <em>philonikia</em>, run parallel. Heroes are heroes because they win, or lose, with their honour intact. Agamemnon, a great warrior, is no hero and meets a rather unheroic end by being killed in a bathtub in his home upon returning as a victor in the Trojan War. Achilles, had it not been for the funeral games, would not have emerged as the hero of<em> The Iliad</em>. His rage and retribution subside after immersion in the nobleness surrounding honourable competition. The Greeks did not have much respect for a man - women were not there in the game, they were often the prize - who could not bear to see another man win. Phthonos - the tendency to deprive another man of good and happiness - was acknowledged but not celebrated.</p>

<p><strong><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/who-was-the-masked-torchbearer-at-paris-olympics-opening-ceremony-6205762">Also Read |&nbsp;Who Was The Masked Torchbearer At Paris Olympics Opening Ceremony?</a></strong></p>

<p>It must be noted that codes of honour applied only to the mortals. The gods and goddesses could lie, cheat, quarrel, and be as base as they wished. Only those who could die could aspire to heroism; only they had to make a choice. Antilochus urging his horses mercilessly when competing against Menelaus makes a less-than-ideal choice. His zeal for victory ought not to be a burden for his beasts. He loses. Even if he'd won, Antilochus would have to swear that he didn't resort to unfair means.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The modern Olympics aim to carry this legacy of honour. And it's not confined to the competition venues. It is now becoming a norm to use the Olympics platform to make political statements. The throwing of the red roses by the Algerian contingent in the river Seine near a protest site where allegedly 300 Algerians were killed in 1961 after a French police crackdown is a powerful gesture of memorialising the victims of colonialism. Being honourable and successful is rarely coterminous now.</p>

<h2><strong>Indian Athletes Are Already Winners</strong></h2>

<p>Coming back to the Indian contingent, their success lies in the fact of their very presence at the Olympics. They are a case study in honour and humility. Racing against time, crossing interminable systemic, societal, and logistical hurdles if they are able to don their country's colours-however non-aesthetically rendered-with pride and dignity on that barge cruising down the Seine, they are winners even before competing. India's neglect of its athletes is a story oft told.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This should bring us to the question: what should winning at the Olympics mean for Indians beyond the immediate photo ops? And what about the promised infrastructural and systemic reforms that would allow Indian children to even think of sports as a real choice? Why do we, the people, expect any glory and honour from our athletes at the Olympics when we do not fuel their fire with honourable conduct on our part? We are the quickest to throw them under the bus for their inability to handle the flash-in-a-pan moment of the limelight they get after any sporting victory.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After such knowledge, what forgiveness?&nbsp;</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Europe's Ariane 6 rocket blasted off carrying satellites on July 9. The lift-off marked the return of Europe's access to outer space. The lift-off was successful, but the mission ended with Ariane 6 coasting into orbit without releasing the final payload.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To protect "Europe's return to space", three French Rafale fighter jets were deployed to escort the rocket and prevent any "malicious intrusion in the air". A video of Rafales escorting the rocket is now viral on X.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Shot from the fighter jet's cockpit, the Rafale fighter is tailing the rocket as it lifts off from Europe's spaceport in Kourou, French Guiana.</p>

<p>Initially delayed for an hour by a small problem that was noticed in the morning, the rocket lifted off into clear skies.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[CCHF is transmitted through tick bites or contact with bodily fluids of infected animals or humans.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A man in Spain&nbsp;died after contracting a lethal 'bleeding eyes' disease called Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF),&nbsp;a deadly viral disease with a fatality rate of up to 40%. According to <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://metro.co.uk/2024/07/29/man-dies-contracting-lethal-bleeding-eyes-disease-tick-bite-spain-21316113/">Metro</a></em>, the 74-year-old died on Saturday&nbsp;after being hospitalised near Madrid.</p>

<p>The man, whose identity has not been revealed, was&nbsp;admitted to Rey Juan Carlos University Hospital in Mostoles, Spain, after being bitten by a tick in Toledo, approximately 100 miles southwest of Madrid. After he was diagnosed with the rare Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) virus, he was transferred to a high-dependency isolation unit at La Paz University Hospital in Madrid to prevent transmission. Initially, his condition was deemed stable, but he subsequently deteriorated after developing all symptoms associated with CCHF.</p>

<p>Tragically, he died from the virus on Saturday, marking the first CCHF-related death in Spain since May 2020. Health authorities are likely to be on high alert to prevent further cases and contain the spread of this dangerous virus.</p>

<p><strong>About&nbsp;Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever</strong></p>

<p>CCHF, described as 'Ebola-like' due to its similar hemorrhagic symptoms, is a disease caused by a tickborne virus. It has been categorised as a "priority disease" on a list by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and currently has no vaccine available.&nbsp;It is also one of nine pathogens deemed most likely to trigger a pandemic.&nbsp;CCHF is endemic in all of Africa, the Balkans, the Middle East and in Asia.&nbsp;</p>

<p>CCHF is transmitted through tick bites or contact with bodily fluids of infected animals or humans. Ticks can also transmit various other diseases, including Lyme disease, and the Powassan virus. The initial symptoms of CCHF include fever, muscle aches, abdominal pain, sore throat, and vomiting. It can also cause mood swings, confusion, and sleepiness, and trigger bleeds, usually from the nose or broken capillaries on the eyes and skin.</p>

<p>As per WHO, general supportive care with treatment of symptoms is the main approach to managing CCHF in people. The antiviral drug ribavirin has been used to treat the infection with apparent benefit. To prevent tick-borne diseases, people are advised to wear protective clothing, use insect repellents, and check for ticks after spending time outdoors.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Germany said on Monday it was not deterred by Russian President Vladimir Putin's threats to relaunch production of intermediate-range nuclear weapons if the United States confirms its intention to deploy missiles to Europe.</p>

<p>"We will not be intimidated by such statements," foreign ministry spokesman Sebastian Fischer told a government press conference.</p>

<p>In early July, Washington and Berlin announced that the "episodic deployments" of long-range US missiles, including Tomahawk cruise missiles, to Germany would begin in 2026.</p>

<p>Putin on Sunday threatened to relaunch production of intermediate-range nuclear weapons if the plans go ahead.</p>

<p>"We will consider ourselves liberated from the unilateral moratorium previously adopted on the deployment of medium- and short-range strike capabilities," Putin said during a naval parade in Saint Petersburg.</p>

<p>Putin added that now in Russia "the development of a number of such systems is in the final stages".</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/video/russian-president-vladimir-putin-warns-us-of-cold-war-style-missile-crisis-819501" target="_blank">"We will take mirror measures in deploying them</a>, taking into account the actions of the US, its satellites in Europe and in other regions of the world," the Russian president warned.</p>

<p>Such missiles, which can travel between 500 and 5,500 kilometres (300-3,400 miles), were the subject of an arms control treaty signed by the United States and the Soviet Union in 1987.</p>

<p>But both Washington and Moscow withdrew from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty in 2019, each accusing the other of violations.</p>

<p>"This type of missile... had already been developed and deployed long ago" by Russia, Fischer said.</p>

<p>"What we are now planning is a response to deter these weapons from being used against Germany or other targets," he added.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Calling India an "important partner" at a time when the world is at a "historic turning point", Japan on Monday said that it hopes to work more closely with the government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the times to come.</p>

<p>External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar and Japanese Foreign Minister Yoko Kamikawa discussed ways to strengthen bilateral cooperation during their 40-minute meeting following the Quad Foreign Ministers Meeting in Tokyo on Monday.</p>

<p>According to the Japanese Foreign Ministry, Kamikawa stated during the meeting that Tokyo wishes to "co-create" new solutions through dialogue and collaboration while deepening cooperation with New Delhi.</p>

<p>In response, EAM Jaishankar mentioned that as the India-Japan Special Strategic and Global Partnership marks its 10th anniversary, India is hoping to further deepen cooperation in a wide range of areas, including the economy, security and people-to-people exchanges.</p>

<p>The two ministers also shared the view that they would strengthen bilateral cooperation, including the steady progress of the high-speed rail project, a flagship project between Japan and India.</p>

<p>They also welcomed the expansion of recruitment for Indian nationals under the JET Programme and the start of the dispatch of Japanese Language Partners to India besides exchanging views on cooperation regarding the Security Council reform, with a view to the Future Summit in September this year.</p>

<p>Earlier, the Quad Foreign Ministers, including EAM Jaishankar, jointly called on Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida following their meeting on Monday afternoon.</p>

<p>During the 20-minute meeting, Kishida welcomed the progress that has been made in various areas of cooperation following discussions between the Quad grouping's foreign ministers that also included Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Japanese Foreign Minister Kamikawa Yoko.</p>

<p>"Honoured to call on Prime Minister Kishida along with fellow Quad Foreign Ministers today in Tokyo. Conveyed the warm regards of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Briefed him on the key takeaways from our meeting today. Appreciate his guidance for continued growth of Quad grouping and value his views on further intensification of India-Japan relations," EAM Jaishankar posted on X after the meeting.</p>

<p>In his remarks, Kishida mentioned that Japan, India, the United States and Australia would continue to cooperate closely at various levels.</p>

<p>"At the outset, Prime Minister Kishida welcomed the visit of the foreign ministers of the three countries to Japan. He stated that amid increasing uncertainty in the international situation, cooperation among Japan, the United States, Australia and India is becoming increasingly important in order to uphold principles and fundamental values," the Japanese Foreign Ministry stated after the meeting.</p>

<p>Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Hayashi Yoshimasa, Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Moriya Hiroshi, Special Advisor to the Prime Minister Ishihara Hirotaka, and several other top officials also attended the meeting.</p>

<p>"The three foreign ministers stated the importance of Japan, the United States, Australia and India, as partners sharing fundamental values, strengthening a rules-based, free and open international order, and confirmed that the four countries will promote various forms of cooperation and further collaborate together for the sake of peace and stability in the region," the statement added.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Amid the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on Monday said that the solution will not emerge from the battlefield, adding that it is imperative to return to dialogue and diplomacy.</p>

<p>He underlined how India had reiterated numerous times that the use of force is not the way to resolve problems between countries, and emphasized that "more needs to be done."</p>

<p>"From the very beginning, we had the view that the use of force does not resolve problems between countries. In the last 2-2.5 years, this conflict has cost lives, economic damage, and global consequences, impacted other societies, and contributed to global inflation... We do not think that the solution will emerge from the battlefield," Mr Jaishankar said while speaking to the press in Tokyo today.</p>

<p>The EAM further called for a return to dialogue and diplomacy and continuous efforts should be made by the countries involved to resolve the conflict.</p>

<p>"We believe that there must be a return to dialogue and diplomacy...Our feeling today is that more needs to be done, we should not resign ourselves to the continuation of the current state of conflict and say let this take its own course..." the minister said.</p>

<p>Mr Jaishankar, along with Foreign Ministers of Japan Yoko Kamikawa and Australia's Penny Wong as well as US Secretary of State Antony Blinken participated in the Quad foreign ministers' meeting held on July 29 in Tokyo.</p>

<p>Quad is a diplomatic partnership between Australia, India, Japan, and the United States, committed to supporting an open, stable, and prosperous Indo-Pacific that is inclusive and resilient.</p>

<p>The Quad Foreign Ministers Meeting joint statement issued on July 29 said that the countries of the bloc were collectively advancing a positive and practical agenda to support the Indo-Pacific region's sustainable development, stability, and prosperity, responding to the region's needs.</p>

<p>The statement said that they contribute to a region in which all countries and people can exercise free choice on how they cooperate, and trade based on partnership, equality and mutual respect.</p>

<p>Through Quad, the countries are supporting the region through practical cooperation on challenges such as maritime security, critical and emerging technologies, cyber security, humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, health security, climate change, counterterrorism, infrastructure and connectivity, and addressing the debt crisis through sustainable, transparent and fair lending and financing practices. The countries will cooperate with regional partners to address shared challenges in the region, the statement read.</p>

<p>PM Modi, who was on an official visit to Moscow recently, met with Russian President Vladimir Putin there. It was PM Modi's first visit to Russia since the war started between Moscow and Kyiv in 2022.<br />
Notably, India has always advocated "peace and diplomacy" for resolving conflict between Ukraine and Russia but has continued to purchase Russian oil, despite the objections of the Western nations, especially the US.</p>

<p>PM Modi said that everyone who believes in humanity is pained when there is a loss of lives. He further stated that it is "heart-wrenching" when innocent children are dying.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Prime Minister also reiterated that the resolution to the conflict can't happen on battlefield but only through dialogue.</p>

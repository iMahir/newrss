       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump called on religious supporters to go the polls in a speech to conservative Christian activists on Saturday, but mentioned only briefly the politically sensitive issue of abortion, a topic of central importance to the group.</p>

<p>Speaking at an event organized by the Faith &amp; Freedom Coalition in Washington, the former president reiterated his position that abortion restrictions should be decided by voters on a state-by-state basis.</p>

<p>That stance contradicts the view of most conservative Christians, and Trump's reticence to push for or even discuss additional federal regulations speaks to how sensitive the issue has become for Republicans.</p>

<p>Trump has repeatedly said Republicans risk electoral defeat if they take too stringent a line on abortion rights. The party's underwhelming performance in the 2022 congressional midterm elections has been widely attributed to the Supreme Court's Dobbs ruling that year, which removed most constitutional protections for the procedure.</p>

<p>"We've gotten abortion out of the federal government and back to the states. The people will decide, and that's the way it should be," Trump said.</p>

<p>"Like Ronald Reagan, I believe in exceptions for the life of the mother - rape and incest ... You have to go with your heart. You have to also remember you have to get elected," Trump said.</p>

<p>Trump's comments on abortion appeared to receive a lukewarm reception. Some in the crowd broke out in chants of "No dead babies!" as he discussed the topic.</p>

<p>But there was no indication the heavily pro-Trump audience would support another candidate as the Nov. 5 general election rematch with Democratic President Joe Biden approaches.</p>

<p>Trump received heavy applause when he discussed several other proposals, including eliminating the Department of Education, a measure favored by many conservative Christians who accuse the federal government of attacking faith-based teaching methods.</p>

<p>At multiple points during his speech, Trump called on Christians to show up to the polls in November, prompting chants of "Vote!" from the crowd.</p>

<p>Trump has claimed credit for appointing three conservative justices to the Supreme Court who helped overturn the Roe v. Wade decision two years ago this Monday, eliminating a nationwide right to abortion in a moment of triumph for conservatives.</p>

<p>Trump has repeatedly said he would not support a federal ban on abortion, however, preferring to leave the issue to individual states.</p>

<p>Ralph Reed, the founder and chairman of the Faith &amp; Freedom Coalition and a key Trump ally, has previously said his group would continue to work towards restrictions at both the state and federal levels.</p>

<h3><strong>On To Philadelphia</strong></h3>

<p>Later on Saturday, Trump will hold a campaign rally at Temple University in a historically Black area of Philadelphia, long a stronghold for Democrats. Trump won just 5% of the vote in precincts within a half-mile radius of Temple's main campus, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer.</p>

<p>The Trump campaign has made courting Black and Hispanic voters, who make up more than half of Philadelphia's population, a priority this cycle, encouraged by some opinion polls that indicate he may be gaining ground with these voters.</p>

<p>Trump has little chance of winning the city, as President Joe Biden, a Democrat, won 81.4% of the votes in Philadelphia County in 2020. But Trump could boost his chances by narrowing the margin in Philadelphia and surrounding counties so critical to the overall tally in Pennsylvania, a battleground state that is hotly contested because it can swing either to Republicans or Democrats.</p>

<p>Trump's campaign said he will use his Philadelphia speech to talk about Biden's handling of inflation, the southern border and crime, all key tenets of the Republican's campaign for a second term.</p>

<p>William Rosenberg, a political science professor at Drexel University, said he believed Trump's main goal was projecting his outreach to Black voters nationally, similar to the rally he held in the Bronx borough of New York City last month.</p>

<p>"It's a play to get on national TV to say you are in Philadelphia, to make the case that this is a Black community," Rosenberg said. "Then perhaps you convince some swing voters that Donald Trump is not so bad."</p>

<p>Democrats have set up posters, billboards and kiosks in Philadelphia and on the Temple campus to promote Biden's policies, including his efforts to forgive student debt, as well as to criticize Trump's record with the Black community.</p>

<p>State lawmaker Malcolm Kenyatta, a Democrat, said Black voters remember Trump's history promoting the bigoted conspiracy theory that questioned whether Barack Obama, the country's first African American president, was born in the United States, and policies that he pursued that hurt the Black working class.</p>

<p>"Donald Trump is in a Black place, but Donald Trump does not give a damn about Black people," Kenyatta said at a press event at a Biden campaign office in Philadelphia, adding that Trump would "get the type of welcome he deserves" from the city.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Police in Jordan said on Saturday they had discovered and detonated explosives stored in a crowded residential area of the capital close to a military airport used by U.S. army planes, and that they were investigating the incident.</p>

<p>The explosives in a home in the Marka neighbourhood northeast of the capital were detonated at the site after the area was evacuated, according to a statement from the public security directorate.</p>

<p>The statement did not say if police suspected the stash was terrorism related, whether arrests were made, and did not detail the quantity of explosives. It added more details would be published once the investigation was complete.</p>

<p>Witnesses said the flat was nearly one kilometre (0.6 miles) from the Marka military airport used by U.S. planes stationed in the kingdom, and by other coalition partners.</p>

<p>The explosives were discovered after civil defence authorities arrived at the flat following an explosion that was initially believed to have been caused by a gas leak, but may have been a botched attempt to manufacture explosives, former officials and security experts said.</p>

<p>"The indications all point it's a terrorist case and an incident related to radical groups that target the kingdom on the pretext of its stance on Gaza," said Saud Al Sharafat, a former brigadier general in Jordanian intelligence.</p>

<p>U.S. ally Jordan has over 3,500 American troops stationed in several bases and, since the war between Israel and Palestinian groups in Gaza erupted in October, it has been increasingly targeted by Iranian-backed groups operating in neighbouring Syria and Iraq.</p>

<p>Over the past year, Jordan has said it has foiled many attempts to smuggle weapons by parties linked to pro-Iranian militias in Syria.</p>

<p>Iran has denied being behind such attempts.</p>

<p>Many of the arms are bound for the neighbouring Israeli-occupied West Bank, Jordanian officials say, adding they have arrested several Jordanians linked to Palestinian fighters.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tens of thousands of protesters waving Israeli flags and chanting slogans against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government rallied in Tel Aviv Saturday, demanding new elections and the return of hostages held in Gaza.</p>

<p>Large protests have occurred in the Israeli city on a weekly basis over Netanyahu's handling of the nearly nine-month-old war in Gaza started by Hamas's October 7 attack on southern Israel.</p>

<p>Many protesters held signs reading "Crime Minister" and "Stop the War" as people poured into the biggest Israeli city's main thoroughfare.</p>

<p>"I am here because I am afraid of the future of my grandchild. There will be no future for them if we don't go out and get rid of the horrible government," said 66-year-old contractor Shai Erel.</p>

<p>"All of the rats in the Knesset... I wouldn't let any one of them be a guard of a kindergarten."</p>

<p>Anti-government protest organisation Hofshi Israel estimated more than 150,000 people attended the rally, calling it the biggest since the Gaza war began.</p>

<p>Some demonstrators lay on the ground covered in red paint in the city's Democracy Square to protest what they say is the death of the country's democracy under Netanyahu.</p>

<p>In an address to the crowd, a former head of Israel's domestic Shin Bet security agency, Yuval Diskin, condemned Netanyahu as Israel's "worst prime minister".</p>

<p>Many are frustrated with the country's right-wing coalition, which includes Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir and other far-right ultra-nationalists, accusing it of prolonging the war in Gaza and putting the country's security and hostages at risk.</p>

<p>Yoram, a 50-year-old tour guide who declined to give his last name, said he was attending every weekly protest as Israel needed elections "yesterday" because of Netanyahu.</p>

<p>"I really hope that the government collapses," he said. "If we go to the original date of elections in 2026, it is not going to be a democratic election."</p>

<p>Hamas seized 251 hostages on October 7, of whom Israel believes 116 remain in Gaza, including 41 who the army says are dead.</p>

<p>A separate Tel Aviv rally on Saturday night drew thousands of relatives and supporters of the hostages.</p>

<p>The attack on Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,194 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory offensive in Gaza has killed at least 37,551 people, also mostly civilians, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-ruled territory.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli army forces strapped a wounded Palestinian man to the hood of the military jeep during an arrest raid in the occupied West Bank city of Jenin on Saturday.</p>

<p>A video circulating on social media and verified by Reuters showed a Palestinian resident of Jenin, Mujahed Azmi, on the jeep that passes through two ambulances.</p>

<p>The Israeli military in a statement said Israeli forces were fired at and exchanged fire, wounding a suspect and arresting him.</p>

<p>Soldiers then violated military protocol, the statement said. "The suspect was taken by the forces while tied on top of a vehicle," it said.</p>

<p>The military said the "conduct of the forces in the video of the incident does not conform to the values" of the Israeli military and that the incident will be investigated and dealt with.</p>

<p>The individual was transferred to medics for treatment, the military said.</p>

<p>Reuters was able to match the location from corroborating and verified footage shared on social media that shows a vehicle transporting an individual tied on top of a vehicle in Jenin. The date was confirmed by an eyewitness interviewed by Reuters.</p>

<p>According to the family of Azmi, there was an arrest raid, and he was injured during the raid, and when the family asked for an ambulance, the army took Mujahed, strapped him on the hood and drove off.</p>

<p>Violence in the West Bank, already on the rise before the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza, has escalated since then with frequent army raids on terror groups, rampages by Jewish settlers in Palestinian villages, and deadly Palestinian street attacks.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[At least 42 people were killed in Israeli attacks on districts of Gaza City in the north of the Palestinian enclave on Saturday, the director of the Hamas-run government media office said.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At least 42 people were killed in Israeli attacks on districts of Gaza City in the north of the Palestinian enclave on Saturday, the director of the Hamas-run government media office said.</p>

<p>One Israeli strike on houses in Al-Shati, one of the Gaza Strip's eight historic refugee camps, killed 24 people, Ismail Al-Thawabta told Reuters. Another 18 Palestinians were killed in a strike on houses in the Al-Tuffah neighborhood.</p>

<p>The Israeli military released a brief statement saying: "A short while ago, IDF fighter jets struck two Hamas military infrastructure sites in the area of Gaza City."</p>

<p>It said more details would be released soon.</p>

<p>Hamas did not comment on the Israeli claim to have hit its military infrastructure. It said in a statement the attacks targeted the civilian population and vowed in a statement "the occupation and its Nazi leaders will pay the price for their violations against our people."</p>

<p>Footage obtained by Reuters showed dozens of Palestinians rushing out to search for victims amid the destroyed houses. The footage showed wrecked homes, blasted walls, and debris and dust filling the street in Shati refugee camp.</p>

<p>Israel's ground and air campaign in Gaza was triggered when Hamas stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, killing around 1,200 people and seizing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.</p>

<p>The offensive has left Gaza in ruins, killed more than 37,400 people, of whom 101 were killed in the past 24 hours, according to Palestinian health authorities, and left nearly the entire population homeless and destitute.</p>

<p>More than eight months into the war, Israel's advance is now focused on the two last areas its forces had yet to seize: Rafah on Gaza's southern edge and the area surrounding Deir al-Balah in the centre.</p>

<p>Residents said Israeli tanks deepened their incursion into western and northern Rafah areas in recent days. On Saturday Israeli forces bombed several areas from air and the ground, forcing many families living in areas described as humanitarian-designated zones to leave northwards.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said forces continued "precise, intelligence-based" targeted operations in Rafah, killing many Palestinian gunmen and dismantling military infrastructure.</p>

<p>On Friday, the Gaza health ministry said at least 25 Palestinians were killed in Mawasi in western Rafah and 50 wounded. Palestinians said a tank shell hit a tent housing displaced families.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said that the incident was under review. "An initial inquiry conducted suggests that there is no indication that a strike was carried out by the IDF (Israel Defence Forces) in the Humanitarian Area in Al-Mawasi," it said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iran's supreme court has overturned a death sentence against popular rapper Toomaj Salehi who was jailed for backing nationwide protests sparked by Mahsa Amini's death, his lawyer said Saturday.</p>

<p>"Salehi's death sentence was overturned," the rapper's lawyer Amir Raisian said in a post on X, adding that the Islamic republic's top court had ordered a retrial.</p>

<p>In April, an Iranian court sentenced Salehi to death for the capital offence of "corruption on earth", Raisian said at the time.</p>

<p>The rapper was also found guilty of "assistance in sedition, assembly and collusion, propaganda against the state and calling for riots", the lawyer said.</p>

<p>Salehi, 33, was arrested in October 2022 after publicly backing demonstrations which had erupted a month earlier, triggered by Amini's death in police custody.</p>

<p>Amini, a 22-year-old Iranian Kurd, was detained by the morality police in Tehran over an alleged breach of the Islamic republic's strict dress rules for women.</p>

<p>"The Supreme Court prevented an irreparable judicial error," Raisian said, adding that the court also ruled that Salehi's "previous sentence (6 years and three months) was also without compliance with the rules of a multiplicity of crimes."</p>

<p>The months-long protests sparked by Amini's death saw hundreds of people killed, including dozens of security personnel.</p>

<p>Thousands were arrested as authorities moved to quell what they branded foreign-instigated "riots".</p>

<p>In January, another singer, Mehdi Yarrahi who criticised the headscarf requirement for women was sentenced to a total of two years and eight months in prison on multiple charges, which would have been served concurrently.</p>

<p>The court later changed Yarrahi's sentence to home confinement due to his health issues.</p>

<p>Nine men have been executed in protest-related cases involving killings and other violence against security forces.</p>

<p>Covering the neck and head has been compulsory for women in Iran since 1983, following the 1979 Islamic Revolution.</p>

<p>Since the protests, women have been increasingly flouting the strict dress code but Iranian police have in recent months toughened controls on women who ignore the rules.</p>

<p>Iranian media has in recent weeks reported that police in the capital have launched a campaign codenamed "Noor", the Persian word for light, in their efforts to double down on those who break the dress code.</p>

<p>In an effort to tackle those breaking hijab laws, the authorities have also shut down cafes and restaurants where the wearing of the hijab was not respected.</p>

<p>The country's parliament has also approved a draft "Chastity and Hijab" law that seeks to toughen penalties on women not adhering to the dress rules.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Italian island of Capri banned tourists from disembarking Saturday after problems with the water supply from the mainland threatened to leave the holiday hotspot parched.</p>

<p>The ban by Capri mayor Paolo Falco forced several ferries on their way to the island from Naples and Sorrento in southern Italy to turn back.</p>

<p>The company charged with supplying the island with water said there had been a technical problem on the mainland on Thursday, and while that had since been fixed problems with the supply to Capri remained.</p>

<p>Falco warned of "a real emergency" and said that while there was still water on most of the island on Friday, local tanks were "running out".</p>

<p>"The emergency would be worsened by the arrival of the thousands of tourists which arrive on Capri daily", he said.</p>

<p>Locals could collect up to 25 litres of drinking water per household from a supply tanker, he said.</p>

<p>The ban, which does not apply to residents, will be in place until further notice.</p>

<p>Capri, in the Bay of Naples, is famed for its white villas, cove-studded coastline and upscale hotels. There are some 13,000 permanent residents but huge numbers of day-trippers in summer months.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russia bombed a residential building in the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv on Saturday, killing three people and wounding more than 50 as it stepped up renewed hostilities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Officials said four guided bombs hit Ukraine's second-largest city, located near the Russian border, and President Volodymyr Zelensky posted footage of the torn-off facade of an apartment block and a crater outside.</p>

<p>"Russian terrorists have again hit Kharkiv with guided bombs," he wrote on Telegram, announcing three dead as rescuers &nbsp;searched the rubble.</p>

<p>Fifty-two people were wounded in the strikes, including three teenagers, the regional prosecutor's office said.</p>

<p>Regional governor Oleg Synegubov had said earlier that "Doctors are fighting for the lives of four patients -- two women and two men, who are in serious condition".&nbsp;</p>

<p>He posted photos of blown-out windows and cars and a minibus damaged by the blast, which tore through the walls of flats, leaving tangled wreckage and rubble.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Rescuers worked with dogs, cutting through doors and dousing a fire in the flats near the city's central bus station.</p>

<p>Bodies in bags were laid on the ground outside, an AFP journalist saw. One dead woman lay at a bus stop, wearing bright sandals, her bag by her side.&nbsp;</p>

<p>An elderly woman with blood running down her face and legs was helped onto a stretcher as she protested she did not want to go to hospital. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Synegubov said "only civilian infrastructure was damaged".</p>

<p>"Since the beginning of this June alone, Russians have used more than 2,400 guided aerial bombs against Ukraine already, about 700 of which were targeted at the Kharkiv region," Zelensky said in a later statement.</p>

<p>"This is calculated terror."</p>

<h3><strong>New weaponry</strong></h3>

<p>Russia launched a new offensive in the region in May, taking significant territory, and has increasingly targeted Kharkiv.</p>

<p>In May, a guided bomb attack on a hardware store killed 16 and wounded dozens.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Defence Minister Rustem Umerov said last month that Russia has dropped almost 10,000 guided bombs on Ukraine this year.</p>

<p>Prosecutors said Russia used its new UMPB D-30 SN guided bombs for the latest attack on Kharkiv, launched from the Belgorod region bordering Ukraine.</p>

<p>Russia's Rossiiskaya Gazeta newspaper wrote this month that the weapons are now being used in the Ukraine war.</p>

<p>They can be fired from the ground at long range as well as from planes, it wrote, which means "it is almost impossible to anticipate" an attack.</p>

<p>"This Russian terror with guided bombs must be stopped and can be stopped. We need strong decisions from our partners so that we can destroy Russian terrorists and Russian combat aircraft where they are," Zelensky said.</p>

<p>Russia also launched 16 cruise missiles and 13 attack drones at energy infrastructure in several regions overnight, Ukraine's military said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This was Russia's "eighth massive, combined attack on energy infrastructure facilities" in three months, the energy ministry said.</p>

<p>More than two years into the Russian invasion, missile and drone attacks have crippled Ukraine's electricity generating capacity and forced Kyiv to impose blackouts and import supplies from the European Union.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Russia said its troops "carried out a group strike with long-range high-precision weaponry from air and sea and also drones on Ukrainian energy facilities that power arms production".&nbsp;</p>

<p>The defence ministry said strikes targeted stores for munitions and "air-launched weapons provided to the Ukrainian military by western countries".&nbsp;</p>

<p>"All the set targets were hit," the ministry said, justifying the strikes as retaliation for Ukrainian attacks on Russia's energy network.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ukraine's energy ministry said energy facilities in the southern Zaporizhzhia and western Lviv regions were damaged.</p>

<p>Russian attacks have destroyed half of Ukraine's energy capacity, according to Zelensky.</p>

<h3><strong>Shelling deaths</strong></h3>

<p>In Zaporizhzhia, Russian artillery shelling also killed one civilian, according to the regional military administration, while a policeman manning a checkpoint was killed by a drone in the southern Kherson region, police said.</p>

<p>Five civilians were killed by shelling in frontline areas of the Donetsk region, regional head Vadym Filashkin said.</p>

<p>Frontline clashes were reported near the towns of Pokrovsk and Toretsk, where Moscow "continues to increase the pace of offensive actions, deploying significant forces," Kyiv's military said.</p>

<p>Russia's defence ministry said troops had improved positions in the Donetsk, Lugansk and Kharkiv regions.</p>

<p>The head of Russian authorities in the Donetsk region, Denis Pushilin, said the region had come under attack from Ukraine.</p>

<p>Three men working for a construction firm were killed by cluster munitions, he said.</p>

<p>In Russia's southern Belgorod region, a man was killed in the shelling of a farm near the border, said governor Vyacheslav Gladkov.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Days after Israel announced a daily pause in fighting on a key route to allow more aid into Gaza, chaos in the besieged Palestinian territory has left vital supplies piled up and undistributed in the searing summer heat.</p>

<p>More than eight months of war, sparked by Hamas's unprecedented October 7 attack on Israel, have led to dire humanitarian conditions in the Gaza Strip and repeated UN warnings of famine.</p>

<p>Desperation among Gaza's 2.4 million population has increased as fighting rages, sparking warnings from agencies that they are unable to deliver aid.</p>

<p>Israel says it has let supplies in and called on agencies to step up deliveries.</p>

<p>"The breakdown of public order and safety is increasingly endangering humanitarian workers and operations in Gaza," the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, OCHA, said in a briefing late Friday.</p>

<p>"Alongside the fighting, criminal activities and the risk of theft and robbery has effectively prevented humanitarian access to critical locations."</p>

<p>But Israel says it has allowed hundreds of trucks of aid into southern Gaza, trading blame with the United Nations over why the aid is stacking up.</p>

<p>It shared aerial footage of containers lined up on the Gazan side of the Kerem Shalom crossing and more trucks arriving to add to the stockpile.</p>

<p>The October Hamas attack on Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,194 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures.</p>

<p>The militants also seized 251 hostages, 116 of whom remain in Gaza although the army says 41 are dead.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory offensive in Gaza has killed at least 37,551 people, also mostly civilians, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-ruled territory.</p>

<p><strong>The blame game</strong></p>

<p>With civil order breaking down in Gaza, the UN says it has been unable to pick up any supplies from Kerem Shalom since Tuesday, leaving crucial aid in limbo.</p>

<p>A deputy UN spokesman this week said the crossing "is operating with limited functionality, including because of fighting in the area".</p>

<p>William Schomburg, International Committee of the Red Cross chief in Rafah, said arranging lorries from the Egyptian side in particular was complicated.</p>

<p>"It's not just a question of civil order, but also the fact that you often have to cross battlefields," he said in an online briefing, adding that the area near Kerem Shalom had been hostile.</p>

<p>"There were even rockets fired nearby. So this whole area is particularly complicated to navigate for reasons linked to the hostilities and for reasons linked to general security."</p>

<p>Israel's coordinator for civilian affairs in the Palestinian territories, known as COGAT, said Thursday "the content of 1,200 aid trucks awaits collection by UN aid agencies", saying a lack of distribution was responsible.</p>

<p>Earlier in the week, COGAT spokesman Shimon Freedman told reporters at the crossing the daily pause on a southern road into Gaza was designed to allow the UN "to collect and distribute more aid" alongside an Israeli military presence.</p>

<p>He said most of the aid had not moved because "organisations have not taken sufficient steps to improve their distribution capacity".</p>

<p><strong>'Don't see any aid'</strong></p>

<p>Aid agencies have instead pointed to Israel's offensive on the southern city of Rafah, which pushed out more than a million people and closed a border crossing with Egypt, as a deepening humanitarian crisis hampered relief efforts.</p>

<p>Schomburg described Rafah City as a "ghost town".</p>

<p>"It is a ghost town in the sense that you see very few people, high levels of destruction, and really just another symbol of the unfolding tragedy that has become Gaza over the last nine months," he said.</p>

<p>The UN food agency has said its aid convoys have been looted inside Gaza by "desperate people".</p>

<p>As both sides stall, it is the civilians in Gaza who are paying the price.</p>

<p>"We don't see any aid. Everything we get to eat comes from our own money and it's all very expensive," said Umm Mohammad Zamlat, 66, from northern Gaza but now living in Khan Yunis in the south.</p>

<p>"Even agencies specialised in aid deliveries are not able to provide anything to us," she added.</p>

<p>NGO Doctors Without Borders said on Friday that six trucks with 37 tons of supplies, mostly essentially medical items, have been held up at the Egyptian part of Kerem Shalom since June 14.</p>

<p>"This is incomprehensible and unacceptable," a statement said.</p>

<p>"It's like asking a fireman to watch a house filled with people burn down, and preventing him putting out the fire."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A French-Chinese satellite blasted off Saturday on a hunt for the mightiest explosions in the universe, in a notable example of cooperation between a Western power and the Asian giant.</p>

<p>Developed by engineers from both countries, the Space Variable Objects Monitor (SVOM) is carrying four instruments -- two French, two Chinese -- that will seek out gamma-ray bursts, the light from which has travelled billions of light years to reach Earth.</p>

<p>The 930-kilogram (2,050-pound) satellite "successfully" took off around 3:00 pm (0700 GMT) aboard a Chinese Long March 2-C rocket from a space base in Xichang, in southwestern Sichuan province, China's National Space Administration said.</p>

<p>Gamma-ray bursts generally occur after the explosion of huge stars -- those more than 20 times as big as the sun -- or the fusion of compact stars.</p>

<p>The extremely bright cosmic beams can give off a blast of energy equivalent to more than a billion billion suns.</p>

<p>Observing them is like "looking back in time, as the light from these objects takes a long time to reach us", Ore Gottlieb, an astrophysicist at the Flatiron Institute's Center for Astrophysics in New York, told AFP.</p>

<p><strong>'Several mysteries'</strong></p>

<p>The rays carry traces of the gas clouds and galaxies they pass through on their journey through space -- valuable data for better understanding the history and evolution of the universe.</p>

<p>"SVOM has the potential to unravel several mysteries in the field of (gamma-ray bursts), including detecting the most distant GRBs in the universe, which correspond to the earliest GRBs," Gottlieb said.</p>

<p>The most distant bursts identified to date were produced just 630 million years after the Big Bang -- when the universe was in its infancy.</p>

<p>"We are... interested in gamma-ray bursts for their own sake because they are very extreme cosmic explosions which allow us to better understand the death of certain stars," said Frederic Daigne, an astrophysicist at the Paris Institute of Astrophysics.</p>

<p>"All of this data makes it possible to test the laws of physics with phenomena that are impossible to reproduce in the laboratory on Earth."</p>

<p>Once analysed, the data could help to improve understanding of the composition of space, and the dynamics of gas clouds or other galaxies.</p>

<p>The project stems from a partnership between the French and Chinese space agencies as well as other scientific and technical groups from both nations.</p>

<p>"It's a great success. We've managed to work well with our Chinese colleagues," Philippe Baptiste, CEO of France's CNES space agency, told AFP after the launch.</p>

<p>Space cooperation at this level between the West and China is fairly uncommon, especially since the United States banned all collaboration between NASA and Beijing in 2011.</p>

<p><strong>Race against time</strong></p>

<p>"US concerns on technology transfer have inhibited US allies from collaborating with the Chinese very much, but it does happen occasionally," said Jonathan McDowell, an astronomer at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in the United States.</p>

<p>In 2018, China and France jointly launched CFOSAT, an oceanographic satellite mainly used in marine meteorology.</p>

<p>Several European countries have also taken part in China's Chang'e lunar exploration programme.</p>

<p>So while SVOM is "by no means unique", it remains "significant" in the context of space collaboration between China and the West, said McDowell.</p>

<p>Once in orbit 625 kilometres (388 miles) above the Earth, the satellite will send its data back to observatories.</p>

<p>The main challenge is that gamma-ray bursts are extremely brief, leaving scientists in a race against time to gather information.</p>

<p>Once it detects a burst, SVOM will send an alert to a team on duty around the clock.</p>

<p>Within five minutes, they will have to rev up a network of telescopes on the ground that will align precisely with the axis of the burst's source to make more detailed observations.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Egyptian Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly on Saturday ordered 16 tourism companies stripped of their licences and referred their managers to the public prosecutor's office for illegally facilitating pilgrims' travel to Mecca, the cabinet said.</p>

<p>The order came after various countries reported more than 1,100 deaths, many attributed to high heat, during this year's hajj.</p>

<p>Arab diplomats told AFP earlier this week that Egyptians accounted for 658 deaths, 630 of them unregistered pilgrims.</p>

<p>"The prime minister has ordered the licences of these companies to be revoked, their managers to be referred to the public prosecutor and the imposition of a fine to benefit the families of the pilgrims who died because of them," the Egyptian cabinet said in a statement.</p>

<p>It said the rise in the deaths of unregistered Egyptian pilgrims stemmed from some companies which "organised the hajj programmes using a personal visit visa, which prevents its holders from entering Mecca" via official channels.</p>

<p>On Friday a senior Saudi official defended the Gulf kingdom's management of the pilgrimage.</p>

<p>Hajj permits are allocated to countries on a quota system and distributed to individuals via a lottery.</p>

<p>Even for those who can obtain them, the steep costs spur many pilgrims to attempt the hajj without a permit, though they risk arrest and deportation if caught by Saudi security forces.</p>

<p>The irregular route, which can save pilgrims thousands of dollars, has become increasingly popular since 2019 when Saudi Arabia introduced a general tourism visa which has made it easier to enter the Gulf kingdom.</p>

<p>The senior official said the Saudi government had confirmed 577 deaths for the two busiest days of hajj: Saturday, when pilgrims gathered for hours of prayers in the blazing sun on Mount Arafat, and Sunday, when they participated in the "stoning of the devil" ritual in Mina.</p>

<p>"This happened amid difficult weather conditions and a very harsh temperature," the official said, while acknowledging that the 577 figure was partial and did not cover all of hajj, which formally ended on Wednesday.</p>

<p>The hajj is one of the five pillars of Islam, and all Muslims with the means must complete it at least once in their lives.</p>

<p>Saudi officials had earlier said 1.8 million pilgrims took part this year, a similar total to last year, and that 1.6 million came from abroad.</p>

<p>The timing of the hajj is determined by the Islamic lunar calendar, shifting forward each year in the Gregorian calendar.</p>

<p>For the past several years the mainly outdoor rituals have fallen during the sweltering Saudi summer.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA) recently discovered the world's oldest deep-sea shipwreck in the Mediterranean Sea, 90 km off the coast of northern Israel.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA) recently discovered the world's oldest deep-sea shipwreck in the Mediterranean Sea, 90 km off the coast of northern Israel. Dating back approximately 3,300 years to the Late Bronze Age, this remarkable find is redefining our understanding of ancient seafaring.<br />
<br />
Discovered at a depth of 1.8 km during a routine survey by a natural gas company, the vessel remains remarkably intact and is loaded with hundreds of amphorae – ancient pottery vessels used for transporting goods.<br />
<br />
According to Jacob Sharvit, head of the IAA marine unit, only two other shipwrecks from the Late Bronze Age with cargo have been discovered in the Mediterranean, both near the Turkish coast and in relatively shallow waters. The depth and preservation of this newly discovered vessel make it a unique and significant archaeological find.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
“There is tremendous potential here for research,” he told the <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/3300-year-old-ship-found-off-israeli-coast-is-oldest-ever-found-in-deep-waters/ ">Times of Israel</a>, adding the newly found ship is remarkably preserved at a “great depth that time has frozen since the moment of disaster.”<br />
<br />
“Its body and contents have not been disturbed by the human hand, nor affected by waves and currents, which do impact shipwrecks in shallower waters,” Mr Sharvit said.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The vessel was found when a robot operated by Energean, the natural gas exploration company, stumbled upon what looked like a collection of amphorae on the seabed. Using specialised equipment aboard the "Energean Star" ship, archaeologists carefully retrieved parts of the ship and some of its cargo over a meticulous two-day operation.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The vessel is estimated to have been around 12-14 metres long and carried a substantial amount of cargo. Some amphorae were visible on the ocean floor, but others were hidden under muddy sediment along with parts of the ship's wooden beams.<br />
<br />
Over two days, they carefully removed two large Canaanite jugs from different parts of the ship to avoid disturbing the rest of the cargo. In ancient times, such jugs were the best way to carry inexpensive and widely made items like oil, wine and fruits, according to the experts.<br />
<br />
Karnit Bahartan, Energean's environmental lead, described it as a "sensational discovery" that far exceeded their expectations.<br />
<br />
Jacob Sharvit pointed out that during the Late Bronze Age, there was a significant increase in international trade due to improvements in ship technology. This allowed ships to carry larger quantities of goods, which made ports like Byblos and other Phoenician cities more important for trade.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Previously, scholars believed that ancient traders navigated cautiously, staying close to shore and moving between ports within sight of land. However, the discovery of this ship challenges that view entirely. It is the first of its kind found so far from any coastline, indicating that ancient mariners had advanced abilities to navigate long distances across open waters. "The newly discovered boat's sailors probably used the sun and the stars to find their way," said Mr Sharvit.<br />
<br />
While the exact cause of the ship's sinking remains unclear, experts speculate it could have been due to a storm or encounters with ancient raiders known as 'The Sea Peoples'. Further research is expected to provide more insights into this discovery.<br />
<br />
The artifacts recovered from the shipwreck will be displayed at the Jay and Jeanie Schottenstein National Campus for the Archaeology of Israel in Jerusalem, giving a rare opportunity for the public to witness firsthand the remnants of ancient maritime history.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With many Israelis gripped by a sense of insecurity following Hamas's unprecedented October 7 attack, the number of women applying for gun permits has soared, while feminist groups have criticised the rush to arms.</p>

<p>According to security ministry data, there have been 42,000 applications by women for gun permits since the attack, with 18,000 approved, more than tripling the number of pre-war licenses held by women.</p>

<p>The surge has been enabled by the loosening of gun laws under Israel's right-wing government and its far-right security minister Itamar Ben Gvir.</p>

<p>More than 15,000 women civilians now own a firearm in Israel and the occupied West Bank, with 10,000 enrolled in mandatory training, according to the ministry.</p>

<p>"I would have never thought of buying a weapon or getting a permit, but since October 7, things changed a little bit," political science professor Limor Gonen told AFP during a weapons handling class at a shooting range in the West Bank settlement of Ariel.</p>

<p>The October 7 attack that triggered the war resulted in the deaths of 1,194 people in Israel, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 37,431 people in Gaza, also mostly civilians, according to the territory's health ministry.</p>

<p>"We were all targeted (on October 7) and I don't want to be taken by surprise, so I'm trying to defend myself," Gonen said after the class, an obligatory step for acquiring a permit.</p>

<p><strong>100,000 armed civilians</strong></p>

<p>While the immediate trigger for the surge in gun buying was the Hamas attack, Ben Gvir was already pledging to reform firearms legislation when he became security minister in late 2022.</p>

<p>He promised to raise the number of civilians holding weapons and "increase self-defence capacity".</p>

<p>Under Ben Gvir, the process for getting a gun license has been sped up, with Israeli media reporting that in the immediate aftermath of the Hamas attack the authorities were often clearing hundreds of permits per day.</p>

<p>Eligibility criteria for gun ownership in Israel now include being a citizen or permanent resident over the age of 18, having a basic command of Hebrew and medical clearance.</p>

<p>The full list of requirements makes it nearly impossible for non-Jews to obtain a permit.</p>

<p>In March, Ben Gvir, who is himself a settler in the West Bank, hailed civilian weapon ownership passing the 100,000 mark, while showing off his own gun at a rally.</p>

<p>But his rush to put deadly arms into the hands of ordinary Israelis has drawn criticism too.</p>

<p>The Gun Free Kitchen Tables Coalition, an Israeli initiative founded by feminist activists, condemned the civilian arms race.</p>

<p>It is "a strategy of far-right settlers to consider the arming of women to be a feminist act", a spokesperson for the group of 18 organisations told AFP.</p>

<p>"The increase of weapons in the civilian space leads to an increase in violence and murder against women. It's time for the state to understand that individual safety is its responsibility."</p>

<p><strong>'More safe'</strong></p>

<p>Community manager Yahel Reznik, 24, said she now felt "a lot more safe" in Ariel, which sits three kilometres north of the Palestinian city of Salfit.</p>

<p>"Thanks to my training I will be able to defend myself and protect others" from an attack, she told AFP.</p>

<p>Violence in the West Bank, which was already rising before the war, has surged since October 7.</p>

<p>At least 549 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli settlers and troops across the West Bank since the start of the Gaza war, according to the Palestinian Authority.</p>

<p>Attacks by Palestinians have killed at least 14 Israelis, according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures.</p>

<p>The surge in gun ownership is not limited to West Bank settlers. In the Israeli coastal city of Netanya, just north of Tel Aviv, Corine Nissim said she never leaves home without her gun.</p>

<p>The 42-year-old English teacher walked her three children to the park with a 9mm Smith &amp; Wesson sticking out the back of her trousers.</p>

<p>"After October 7, I think like most people in Israel, I realised that the only person I can trust is myself," she told AFP, adding she bought a gun not to feel "helpless".</p>

<p>"The worst scenario that was going through my head was that, of course, terrorists attack me and my family in our own house," the mother said.</p>

<p>Her decision to own a gun initially surprised some in the seaside town known for its tranquillity and safety, she said.</p>

<p>"People watched me and said, 'This is so surreal to see you like this with a gun and with the baby'" said Nissim.</p>

<p>But, she said, others started to agree with her and said they would follow suit.</p>

<p>"Many women told me: 'I'm going to do it. I'm going to get a gun as well.'"</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Softening his stance on immigration, former US President Donald Trump has promised to give automatic green cards to foreign students who graduate from US colleges to prevent them from returning to their home countries like India and China where they become multibillionaires.</p>

<p>Trump's departure from the anti-immigrant rhetoric comes ahead of the November presidential election in which immigration and deportation of illegal immigrants are among the key issues for voters.</p>

<p>Trump, however, always supported a merit-based legal immigration system.</p>

<p>"What I want to do and what I will do is --you graduate from a college, I think you should get a Green Card automatically as part of your diploma, a Green Card to be able to stay in this country. And that includes junior colleges too," Trump, 78, said in the "All-In" podcast.</p>

<p>A Green Card, known officially as a permanent resident card, is an identity document showing a person has permanent residency in the United States.</p>

<p>The podcast was hosted by four venture capitalists: Chamath Palihapitiya, Jason Calacanis, David Sacks, and David Friedberg, three of whom are immigrants.</p>

<p>Trump's remarks came as he was pressed by Calacanis to "promise us you will give us more ability to import the best and brightest around the world to America." Trump, the presumptive candidate from the Republican Party, also lamented "stories where people graduated from a top college or from a college, and they desperately wanted to stay here, they had a plan for a company, a concept, and they can't - they go back to India, they go back to China, they do the same basic company in those places.</p>

<p>"...and they become multi-billionaires employing thousands and thousands of people, and it could have been done here," he said.</p>

<p>"Let me just tell you that it's so sad when we lose people from Harvard, MIT, from the greatest schools. and lesser schools that are phenomenal schools also. And what I wanted to do, and I would have done this, but then we had to solve the COVID problem because that came in and, you know, sort of dominated for a little while, as you perhaps know," Trump said in response.</p>

<p>Trump reiterated his first-term policy, about foreign students getting a Green Card after receiving a degree from a higher education institution in the STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) field.</p>

<p>"Anybody graduates from a college, you go in there for two years or four years, If you graduate or you get a doctorate degree from a college, you should be able to stay in this country," Trump said.</p>

<p>"We force the brilliant people, the people that graduate from college, the people that are number one in their class from the best colleges, you have to be able to recruit these people and keep the people," he asserted.</p>

<p>Somebody graduates at the top of the class; they can't even make a deal with the company because they don't think they're going to be able to stay in the country.</p>

<p>"That is going to end on day one," Trump announced.</p>

<p>According to the latest annual Open Doors report of the Institute of International Education more than a million international students from more than 210 places of origin are studying at US higher education institutions during the 2022-23 academic year.</p>

<p>China remained the top-sending country in 2022/23, with 289,526 students studying in the U.S. But students from China saw a slight decline of 0.2 per cent compared to the previous year.</p>

<p>India, the second largest sending country, reached an all-time high of 268,923 international students in 2022/23, an increase of 35 per cent as against the previous year. Overall 53 per cent of all international students in 2022/23 were from China and India, comparable to the prior year.</p>

<p>However, the market share for each place of origin has shifted, with 27 per cent of students from China and 25 per cent of students from India, in comparison to 33 per cent from China and 18 per cent from India in 2017-18. Trump's latest comments stood in contrast to the immigration policy he adopted while in office and were a direct overture to wealthy business leaders whom he is courting as donors and supporters of his campaign, The New York Times said.</p>

<p>Trump had at times sought to reform the nation's immigration system to scale back family-based immigration and to prioritise wealthy immigrants, who had valuable work skills or who were highly educated.</p>

<p>But during his term as president, Trump's immigration agenda included restrictions on green cards, visa programmes, refugee resettlement and other forms of legal immigration, significantly reducing the number of lawful permanent residents entering the country.</p>

<p>He began his presidency by signing an executive order that banned travellers from seven predominantly Muslim countries and later embraced a proposal to cut legal immigration by half.</p>

<p>Throughout his presidency, Trump assailed the H-1B visa programme, favoured by tech companies as a way to hire foreign skilled workers, as a "theft of American prosperity." The H-1B visa is a non-immigrant visa that allows US companies to employ foreign workers in speciality occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise.</p>

<p>Technology companies depend on it to hire tens of thousands of employees each year from countries like India and China.</p>

<p>Trump expanded restrictions on legal immigration during the pandemic and his last year in office and had proposed suspending all immigration to the United States and deporting foreign students if they did not attend at least some classes in person.</p>

<p>A month before the 2020 election, Trump again moved to restrict the H-1B visa programme.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Britains wealthiest family, the Hindujas, have said they were "appalled" by a Swiss courts ruling of jail terms for some members and have filed an appeal in a higher court challenging the verdict finding them guilty of exploiting workers.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Britain's wealthiest family, the Hindujas, have said they were “appalled” by a Swiss court's ruling of jail terms for some members and have filed an appeal in a higher court challenging the verdict finding them guilty of exploiting vulnerable domestic workers from India at their villa in Geneva.</p>

<p>In a statement issued on behalf of the family on Friday, lawyers from Switzerland stressed their clients – Prakash and Kamal Hinduja, both in their 70s and their son Ajay and his wife Namrata – had been acquitted of all human trafficking charges.</p>

<p>They also dismissed media reports that any members of the family faced detention after court reports from Geneva said the four were sentenced to between four and four-and-a-half years in prison.</p>

<p>“Our clients have been acquitted of all human trafficking charges. We are appalled and disappointed by the rest of the decision made in this court of first instance, and we have, of course, filed an appeal to the higher court, thereby making this part of the judgement not effective,” reads the statement signed by lawyers Yael Hayat and Robert Assael and Roman Jordan.</p>

<p>“Under Swiss law, the presumption of innocence is paramount till a final judgement by the highest adjudicating authority is enforced. Contrary to some media reports, there is no effective detention for any members of the family,” they said.</p>

<p>The lawyers also pointed out that “it should also be recalled that the plaintiffs in this case had withdrawn their respective complaints after declaring to the court that they had never intended to be involved in such proceedings”.</p>

<p>“The family has full faith in the judicial process and remains confident that the truth will prevail,” they conclude.</p>

<p>The statement followed a hearing in the Swiss city of Geneva after prosecutors opened the case for alleged illegal activity, including exploitation, human trafficking and violation of Switzerland's labour laws.</p>

<p>The family members were accused of seizing the workers' passports, barring them from leaving the villa and forcing them to work very long hours for a pittance in Switzerland, among other things.</p>

<p>Some workers allegedly spoke only Hindi and were paid their wages in rupees in banks back in India that they could not access.</p>

<p>During the trial, prosecutors alleged the family spent more on their dog than on their servants.</p>

<p>The family's legal team had countered the allegations and told the court the staff were treated respectfully and provided with accommodation.</p>

<p>According to ‘The Sunday Times Rich List' released last month, the UK-based Hinduja family once again emerged as the country's richest, with wealth estimated at around GBP 37.196 billion.</p>

<p>They saw this tally increase over the previous year in the wake of the opening of the brand-new luxury OWO Raffles Hotel in the heart of London.</p>

<p>The UK-based family's group of companies, headed by chairman G.P. Hinduja, operates in 48 countries and across several sectors – automotive, oil and specialty chemicals, banking and finance, IT, cyber security, healthcare, trading, infrastructure project development, media and entertainment, power, and real estate.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The American space agency NASA has confirmed that the return of the Indian origin astronaut Sunita Williams from the International Space Station (ISS) has been further delayed and no new date has been set for her "happy landing".]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The American space agency NASA has confirmed that the return of Indian origin astronaut Sunita Williams from the International Space Station (ISS) has been further delayed and no new date has been set for her "happy landing".</p>

<p>This comes as the spacecraft in which she travelled to space, the Boeing Starliner, has been facing a series of glitches. Sunita Williams and her co-passenger Butch Wilmore are both safe on the ISS along with the seven other crew members who inhabit the "mini-city in space" - the ISS.</p>

<p>Riding atop the Boeing Starliner on its maiden mission, Ms Williams reached the ISS on June 5 on what was to be possibly a 10-day mission but since then it has been extended twice thanks to issues with the small rockets that help the crew module return to Earth, and a series of Helium leaks that bedevil the Boeing Starliner on its first crewed flight.</p>

<p>NASA says the crew is not pressed for time to leave the station since there are plenty of supplies in orbit, and the station's schedule is relatively open through mid-August.</p>

<p>Initially, Ms Williams was to return potentially on June 14, this was scrapped and a new date June 26 was set by NASA, this has also been postponed and a new date has not been announced yet.</p>

<p>"NASA and Boeing leadership are adjusting the return to Earth of the Starliner Crew Flight Test spacecraft with agency astronauts. The move off Wednesday, June 26, deconflicts Starliner's undocking and landing from a series of planned International Space Station spacewalks while allowing mission teams time to review propulsion system data," a statement said.</p>

<p>Five of the 28 thrusters on the Boeing Starliner are having issues and there have been five Helium leaks on the space craft. Experts say a minimum of 14 thrusters are required for a safe return.</p>

<p>Boeing says, "Starliner has completed 77 of the original 87 flight-test objectives, with the remaining 10 will occur between undocking and landing."</p>

<p>NASA says mission managers are evaluating future return opportunities following the station's two planned spacewalks on Monday, June 24, and Tuesday, July 2. So it could well be nearly a month long stay for Ms Williams in space on her third mission to space.</p>

<p>"Starliner is performing well in orbit while docked to the space station," said Steve Stich, manager of NASA's Commercial Crew Program</p>

<p>"We are strategically using the extra time to clear a path for some critical station activities while completing readiness for Butch and Suni's return on Starliner and gaining valuable insight into the system upgrades we will want to make for post-certification missions."</p>

<p>Boeing has faced several hiccups in the Starliner development and initially it was to have completed this with a $4.2 billion contract but has now spent a total of about $ 5.7 billion and the going is still uphill as the mission remains incomplete.</p>

<p>NASA wanted a second alternative to SpaceX's Crew Dragon and hence Boeing Starliner was being pushed through. Boeing is going through a bad patch in general and its aviation and aircraft business has also been stumbling.</p>

<p>NASA says Wilmore and Williams remain integrated with the Expedition 71 crew, assisting with station operations as needed and completing add-on in-flight objectives for NASA certification of Starliner.</p>

<p>Ms Williams is a qualified navy test pilot she had flown twice earlier to space in 2006 and 2012 and according to data from NASA, before this Starliner mission Sunita has already spent a cumulative total of 322 days in space.</p>

<p>"With seven space walks totalling 50 hours and 40 minutes, Sunita held the record for total cumulative spacewalk time by a female astronaut but that has since been overtaken by Peggy Whitson with 10 spacewalks."</p>

<p>Ms Williams has helped design the Boeing Starliner so she should be familiar with all its details.</p>

<p><strong>Such Delays Not Unforeseen on Maiden Missions</strong></p>

<p>"We are taking our time and following our standard mission management team process," said Stich.</p>

<p>"We are letting the data drive our decision making relative to managing the small helium system leaks and thruster performance we observed during rendezvous and docking. Additionally, given the duration of the mission, it is appropriate for us to complete an agency-level review, similar to what was done ahead of the NASA's SpaceX Demo-2 return after two months on orbit, to document the agency's formal acceptance on proceeding as planned."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the space fairing community prays for the safe return of Ms Williams and Mr Wilmore, but it could be embarrassing for Boeing if SpaceX's Crew Dragon were to be used to rescue the astronauts stuck at the space station.</p>

<p>"The crew's feedback has been overwhelmingly positive, and they know that every bit of learning we do on the Crew Flight Test will improve and sharpen our experience for future crews," said Mark Nappi, vice president and program manager, Boeing's Starliner Program.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An Australian woman who owns a gym faked her own death to claim a nearly $500,000 insurance payout as part of an elaborate scheme where she posed as her partner. According to the New York Post, the woman, identified as 42-year-old Karen Salkilld, was arrested in March after filing the insurance claim in her partner's name, falsely saying she had died in a car accident. The claim included a series of fabricated documents, including a death certificate, a Coroner's Court of Western Australia delegate letter and an investigation record into a death.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/06/21/lifestyle/gym-owner-karen-salkilld-faked-own-death-posed-as-partner-to-claim-nearly-500k-insurance-payout/#:~:text=A%20gym%20owner%20faked%20her,a%20car%20accident%20in%20Broome."><em>Post </em></a>reported that the insurance company transferred $477,520 into a bank account that the 42-year-old had set up in her partner's name. In the following days, the fitness instructor made several payments from the account. However, the scheme began to unravel when Ms Salkilld's bank flagged and subsequently froze the suspicious account.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Then, in a desperate bid to access the funds, Ms Salkilld visited Palmyra Police Station with several forms of ID that had been certified by an officer. However, as these copies were altered before being submitted to the bank, they didn't pass the verification process.&nbsp;</p>

Startled, she then replied: "What the hell? Who are you guys? I'm not talking to you guys."</p>

<p>The reporter went on: "How did you think you could get away with it? You're charged with serious fraud offences." Ms Salkilld then responded, "Is this a joke?".</p>

<p>Ms Salkilld was arrested in March and pleaded guilty to the two offences in her first appearance in front of a magistrate.

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Paying a visit to the world's most terrifying places may sound like a nightmare for many, but some globe-trotters consider it adventurous. If you are one of those, we have a list of 10 spine-chilling places that you might want to explore.</p>

<p>Here are 10 of the world's most terrifying places:</p>

<h2><strong>1. Nagoro, Japan</strong></h2>

<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-06/9ku3huso_negoro_625x300_22_June_24.jpeg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Nagoro is a small village in Japan full of life-sized dolls. These dolls outnumber humans by nearly 10 to 1. Local artist Tsukimi Ayano had started creating lookalike&nbsp;dolls&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 13px;">of her dead neighbours or those who had shifted to a different location. In the village, there are about 350 dolls and 27 humans -- something enough to describe the place as a terrifying toyland.</span></p>

<h2><strong>2. Centralia, Pennsylvania</strong></h2>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-06/ohm9hkf_centralia-_625x300_22_June_24.jpeg?im=FaceCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=1200,height=738" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>Back in 1962, a coal mine mysteriously caught fire in Centralia. A few years later, similar isolated incidents occurred - a gas station owner reported dangerously high gasoline temperatures in his underground tanks in 1979, and a boy nearly fell into a 150-foot-deep sinkhole in 1981. After these occurrences, residents started migrating to other locations. As of today, the town has many torn-down buildings and crumbled sidewalks. One might even see smoke coming out from the subterranean fires, which, as per scientists, will continue to burn for another 250 years.</p>

<h2><strong>3. Gomantong Caves, Malaysia</strong></h2>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-06/315l8v5_gomantong-caves_625x300_22_June_24.jpeg?im=FaceCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=1200,height=738" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>Gomantong Caves are home to two million bats that drop their faeces all over the ground and even on the handrails. Additionally, there are several million Malaysian cockroaches, hundreds of snakes, scorpions, and freshwater crabs living there. Still want to pay a visit? We doubt you want to.</p>

<h1><strong>4. Hanging Coffins, Philippines</strong></h1>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-06/oeeidmg8_hanging-coffins_625x300_22_June_24.jpeg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>Imagine a place where coffins aren't buried but attached to the sides of cliffs. If you ever visit this location and look up, you will see dead bodies hanging in their customised afterlife homes.</p>

<h2><strong>5. The Door To Hell, Turkmenistan</strong></h2>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-06/oerbe4s_door-to-hell_625x300_22_June_24.jpeg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>The name of this place is enough to send shivers down anyone's spine. Located in the Karakum Desert in Turkmenistan, the "Door to Hell" is a 230-foot-wide crater that simply keeps on burning. The story behind this place dates back to 1971 when Soviet scientists, who were searching for oil, accidentally hit a methane reserve. The drilling platform collapsed, forming the crater and resulting in a dangerous gas release into the air. The scientists then decided to light the crater on fire to burn off the methane. Now, it has been burning continuously for over 50 years.</p>

<h2><strong>6. Snake Island, Brazil</strong></h2>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-06/6uiu946g_snake-island_625x300_22_June_24.jpeg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>As the name suggests, you will find an insane number of venomous reptiles on this island. Some reports even suggest that there is an average of one to five snakes per square metre here. The venom of these snakes is said to be five times stronger than their mainland counterparts. That is why the Brazilian government has banned the public from entering this place.</p>

<h2><strong>7. Haw Par Villa, Singapore</strong></h2>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-06/9q4dcg7_haw-par-villa-singapore_625x300_22_June_24.jpeg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>This 86-year-old Singaporean theme park has over 1,000 statues, each as strange as it gets. These statues are so bizarre that you will see a human head on a giant crab, among other peculiarities. The underworld-themed 'Ten Courts of Hell' is considered the main element of Haw Par Villa. To teach young children about morality, the models showcase different types of punishments, such as individuals getting cut in half by a saw for misusing books or people thrown onto a hill of knives for lending money with unreasonably high interest rates.</p>

<h2><strong>8. Mount Huashan, China</strong></h2>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-06/ftg5lojo_mount-huashan-china_625x300_22_June_24.jpeg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>Dubbed "the most dangerous hike in the world," this location in China is popular for its plank walk - a rickety, 12-inch-wide wooden path attached to the side of a mountain, thousands of feet off the ground. Many visitors hold onto loose metal chains while watching out for broken or missing planks at the same time. Some travellers claim that the hike is worth all the risks due to the beautiful temples and views at the summit.</p>

<h2><strong>9. Clown Motel, Nevada</strong></h2>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-06/p9llanbo_clown-motel-nevada_625x300_22_June_24.jpeg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>Want to know about the creepiest accommodation? The Clown Motel in Tonopah, Nevada can give you Halloween vibes at any time of the year. It features brightly coloured doors, a polka-dot facade, and two 19-foot clown cutouts on either side of the building. Inside, you'll find over 3,000 clown figurines. Sounds eerie, right?</p>

<h2><strong>10. Cerro Negro, Nicaragua</strong></h2>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-06/aelpagu8_cerro-negro-nicaragua_625x300_22_June_24.jpeg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>Climbing up an active volcano is thrilling enough, but imagine an activity where you have to sit or stand on a piece of plywood and slide your way down the slopes. Every person runs the risk of being burned by lava or breathing in toxins. It must be noted that Cerro Negro has erupted more than 20 times since 1850.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Japan's Emperor Naruhito and Empress Masako arrive in Britain on Saturday ahead of a three-day state visit hosted by King Charles III.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Japan's Emperor Naruhito and Empress Masako arrive in Britain on Saturday ahead of a three-day state visit hosted by King Charles III.</p>

<p>The royal couple are due to touch down on a flight from Japan and spend Sunday and Monday at private engagements before the official programme begins on Tuesday.</p>

<p>The highlight will be a state banquet at Buckingham Palace, with all eyes on a possible appearance by the heir to the throne Prince William's wife Catherine, rarely seen in recent months due to cancer treatment.</p>

<p>Naruhito, 64, will also go to Windsor Castle west of London to lay a wreath on the tomb of Queen Elizabeth II, whose state funeral he and the empress, 60, attended in September 2022.</p>

<p>With Britain in the midst of a general election campaign, it was not immediately clear if there would be any meeting with Prime Minister Rishi Sunak.</p>

<p>Visiting heads of state have typically held talks with the premier and opposition leader, or addressed lawmakers in parliament.</p>

<p>But there are no MPs as parliament has been dissolved before the July 4 vote.</p>

<p>The trip will be the emperor's second official state visit since his accession to the throne in 2019, following a visit to Indonesia last year.</p>

<p>For Charles, 75, it will be the third state visit he has hosted since he ascended to the throne following the death of his mother.</p>

<h3><strong>&nbsp;'Fond memories'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Like Catherine, he was diagnosed with cancer earlier this year but has made a limited return to public duties, and was seen this week with his wife Queen Camilla at the Royal Ascot horse racing meeting.</p>

<p>Catherine, a future queen who is widely known as Kate, is currently undergoing chemotherapy and has stepped back from public life to aid her recovery.</p>

<p>She made a tentative return to public life last week when she attended a military parade in London to mark Charles' official birthday.</p>

<p>Elizabeth, whose 70-year reign began in 1952, hosted two Japanese state visits during her time on the throne: Emperor Hirohito in 1971 and his eldest son Emperor Akihito -- Naruhito's father -- in 1998.</p>

<p>Speaking in Tokyo ahead of the trip, Naruhito said Britain's royals treated him "like family" during his time studying in England in the 1980s.</p>

<p>Naruhito recalled that during his two years at Oxford University, he was invited to Balmoral Castle in Scotland for a few days.</p>

<p>"I have very fond memories of the queen driving a car and inviting me to a barbecue... and Prince Philip showing me around by driving a carriage himself," he told reporters in a rare press conference.</p>

<p>The state visit's programme will also include a Guard of Honour ceremony, a carriage procession at Buckingham Palace, and visits to museums and the Francis Crick Institute, a biomedical research centre in London.</p>

<p>Before leaving on Friday the Japanese emperor and empress will visit Oxford, where they both studied, for private engagements.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

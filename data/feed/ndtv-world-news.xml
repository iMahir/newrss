       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The World Health Organization is sending more than one million polio vaccines to Gaza to be administered over the coming weeks to prevent children being infected after the virus was detected in sewage samples, its chief said on Friday.</p>

<p>"While no cases of polio have been recorded yet, without immediate action, it is just a matter of time before it reaches the thousands of children who have been left unprotected," Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in an opinion piece in Britain's The Guardian newspaper.</p>

<p>He wrote that children under five were most at risk from the viral disease, and especially infants under two since normal vaccination campaigns have been disrupted by more than nine months of conflict.</p>

<p>Poliomyelitis, which is spread mainly through the fecal-oral route, is a highly infectious virus that can invade the nervous system and cause paralysis. Cases of polio have declined by 99% worldwide since 1988 thanks to mass vaccination campaigns and efforts continue to eradicate it completely.</p>

<p>Israel's military said on Sunday it would start offering the polio vaccine to soldiers serving in the Gaza Strip after remnants of the virus were found in test samples in the enclave.</p>

<p>Besides polio, the U.N. reported last week a widespread increase in cases of Hepatitis A, dysentery and gastroenteritis as sanitary conditions deteriorate in Gaza, with sewage spilling into the streets near some camps for displaced people.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Congress leader <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/topic/priyanka-gandhi-vadra" target="_blank">Priyanka Gandhi Vadra</a> on Friday ripped into the Israeli government over its war on Gaza - which is now into its 10th month and has killed nearly 40,000 people - and called on the global community to condemn Tel Aviv's "genocidal actions and force them to stop".</p>

<p>"It is the moral responsibility of every right-thinking individual, including Israeli citizens who do not believe in hatred and violence, and every government in the world to condemn the Israeli government... their actions are unacceptable in a world that professes civility and morality."</p>

<p>"It is no longer enough to speak up for civilians, mothers, fathers, doctors, nurses, aid workers, journalists, teachers, writers, poets, senior citizens, and the thousands of innocent children who are being wiped out, day-after-day, by the horrific genocide taking place in Gaza."</p>

<p>Her trenchant criticism of the Israeli government - which she called "barbaric" - followed Prime Minister <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/topic/benjamin-netanyahu" target="_blank">Benjamin Netanyahu</a>'s speech Wednesday in the United States.</p>

<p>"... we are subjected to the image of the Israeli Prime Minister being given a standing ovation in the US Congress," she said on X, "He (the Israel leader) calls it 'a clash between barbarism and civilisation'... he is absolutely correct, except it is him and his government that are barbaric."</p>

<p>"...and their barbarism is given unstinted support of most of the western world..."</p>

<p>"It is truly a shame to watch," the Congress leader said.</p>

<h3><strong>Israel Prime Minister's US Speech</strong></h3>

<p>Mr Netanyahu, addressing a divided US Congress on America's continued support - which has included military aid - declared the nations had to unite for "civilisation to triumph".</p>

<p>Hours before his speech there were massive protests in Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Crowds carrying Palestinian flags and placards gathered outside the Capitol calling for a ceasefire and Mr Netanyahu's arrest, even as prosecutors seek an international warrant.</p>

<p><strong>READ |&nbsp;</strong><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/israel-carries-out-new-raids-in-gaza-ahead-of-netanyahus-address-to-us-congress-6178865" target="_blank">Israel Carries Out New Raids In Gaza Ahead Of Netanyahu's Address</a></p>

<p>Israel has rejected accusations brought by South Africa at the United Nations' top court that its military operation in Gaza is a state-led genocide campaign against Palestinians. It has reacted angrily to a decision by the International Criminal Court's prosecutor to seek a warrant against Mr Netanyahu.</p>

<h3><strong>Israel Attacks On Gaza Strip</strong></h3>

<p>Meanwhile, as those protests were taking place, Israel carried out&nbsp;new raids.&nbsp;The attacks destroyed homes in towns east of Khan Younis in southern Gaza and thousands were displaced, residents said.</p>

<p>Some Palestinians - gathered at a hospital in Khan Younis before funerals for families and loved ones - criticised the United States, Israel's most important international ally, for welcoming Mr Netanyahu.</p>

<p>A day after his speech Mr Netanyahu met Vice President <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/topic/kamala-harris" target="_blank">Kamala Harris</a>, who is the presumptive Democratic nominee for the 2024 Presidential election. Ms Harris' comments seemed to signal a shift in American foreign policy, at least in the final few days of Joe Biden's administration.</p>

<h3><strong>"Will Not Be Silent": Kamala Harris</strong></h3>

<p>"What has happened in Gaza over the past nine months is devastating..." she said. "We cannot look away in the face of these tragedies. We cannot allow ourselves to become numb. I will not be silent."</p>

<p>"We cannot look away in the face of these tragedies. We cannot allow ourselves to become numb to the suffering and I will not be silent," Ms Harris declared.</p>

<p>The US this week said negotiations on a ceasefire-for-hostages deal were moving forward, and that Mr Biden and Mr Netanyahu would discuss the agreement during the latter's US visit.</p>

<p>India's Position On Israel-Gaza War</p>

<p>The Indian government last week reaffirmed its commitment to a peaceful resolution and its support for a negotiated 'two-state solution', which will lead to "the establishment of a sovereign, independent and viable state of Palestine, living... side by side at peace with Israel".</p>

<p>In May the government offered a stronger reaction, as it strongly condemned deaths of civilians and called the resulting humanitarian crisis in the region "simply unacceptable."</p>

<h3><strong>Hamas' Oct 7 Attack</strong></h3>

<p>Hamas-led fighters stormed into southern Israel on October 7, killing 1,200 people and taking 250 captives, according to Israeli tallies, triggering a war in which nearly 40,000 people in Gaza have been killed, most of whom are civilians and children, and millions displaced, many more than once.</p>

<p>Hamas and other militants are still holding 120 hostages; Israel believes around a third of them are dead. Months of stop-and-start talks have failed to produce a deal to gain their release.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar met his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov on the sidelines of ASEAN events in Laos' Vientiane on Friday.</p>

<p>In a picture shared by the Russian Embassy in India, Mr Jaishankar and Lavrov were seen sharing a laugh as they shook hands.</p>

<p>Russian Embassy in India stated on social media platform X, "#Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and #India's External Affairs Minister Dr S.Jaishankar @DrSJaishankar met on the sidelines of #ASEAN events."</p>

<p>Previously, the two leaders had met on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) Heads of State Council meeting in Astana. During his meeting with Lavrov on July 3, Mr Jaishankar raised "strong concern about Indian nationals" currently in the war zone in Russia. The two leaders also discussed the "global strategic landscape" and exchanged assessments and views.</p>

<p>In a post on X, Mr Jaishankar said, "Good to meet Russian FM Sergey Lavrov in Astana today. Wide ranging conversation on our bilateral partnership and contemporary issues. Noted the progress in many areas since our last meeting in December 2023."</p>

<p>"Raised our strong concern on Indian nationals who are currently in the war zone. Pressed for their safe and expeditious return. Also discussed the global strategic landscape and exchanged assessments and views," he added.</p>

<p>Earlier in the day, Mr Jaishankar, who is on a visit to Vientiane from July 25-28, participated in the ASEAN meeting. In his remarks, Mr Jaishankar said that political, economic and security cooperation with ASEAN is of the utmost priority.</p>

<p>Mr Jaishankar said that for India, ASEAN is the cornerstone of its Act East policy, the Indo-Pacific vision that was built on it and the people-to-people linkages that India is constantly seeking to expand.</p>

<p>Mr Jaishankar thanked Minister for Foreign Affairs of Singapore Vivian Balakrishnan, for his wishes on the former's reappointment and said he looked forward to working with him in the future. He also appreciated Balakrishnan's role as country coordinator.</p>

<p>As the Philippines will take over as the next country coordinator, Mr Jaishankar said that he looked forward to working closely with the Secretary of Foreign Affairs of the Philippines, Enrique Manalo.</p>

<p>He congratulated Laos for the chairmanship of ASEAN. "I extend our fullest support for the successful chairmanship [to Lao PDR]. I also thank our colleague and Lao PDR for the warm welcome and hospitality."</p>

<p>He welcomed Timor-Leste as an observer in the meeting. "Last year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that we will open an embassy in Delhi. We are proceeding to do so very shortly and in fact, we will be undertaking high-level visits there as well."</p>

<p>"I extend my deepest appreciation to all of you for strengthening ASEAN India relations through substantive and tangible cooperation identified under the ASEAN India Plan of Action," Mr Jaishankar said, adding that he looked forward to further discussions.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Franco-Swiss airport was evacuated for security reasons on Friday, hours after arson attacks disrupted the French rail network ahead of the Olympics opening ceremony.</p>

<p>"For safety reasons, the terminal had to be evacuated and is currently closed," the Basel-Mulhouse EuroAirport said on its website, adding that further information would follow.</p>

<p>Several French airports, including EuroAirport, had to be evacuated late last year due to a series of fake bomb threats.</p>

<p>EuroAirport, which is located on the French side of the border near Basel, welcomed eight million passengers in 2023.</p>

<p>The evacuation came as French authorities were hunting for the perpetrators of arson attacks on the high-speed train network, which disrupted travel for hundreds of thousands of people.</p>

<p>The Paris Olympics opening ceremony will begin Friday evening.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Fifty days and counting, Indian-origin astronaut Sunita Williams remains in limbo, uncertain of when and how she may return to Earth.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fifty days and counting, Indian-origin astronaut Sunita Williams remains in limbo, uncertain of when and how she may return to Earth. However, the US space agency maintains that she and the eight other astronauts on board the International Space Station are safe and in 'good spirits'.</p>

<p>An Indian space expert, speaking with a touch of humour, likened her situation to being in a state of 'Trishanku'-a state where one is indeterminably but willingly stuck between a rock and a hard place.</p>

<p>Today, NASA provided further updates, indicating that they are closer to identifying the root cause of the Boeing Starliner's malfunctioning systems, such as the failed thrusters and a series of helium leaks during its maiden test flight. However, there was no clarity on when, or if, Astronaut Sunita Williams and her crewmate Butch Wilmore will return, or if they will do so aboard the same Boeing Starliner spacecraft.</p>

<p>According to Boeing, the Starliner can remain docked with the space station for a maximum of ninety days, after which the batteries on board the spacecraft may deplete. As a result, US space technologists have approximately forty days left to determine whether Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore will return to Earth on the impaired Boeing Starliner, or if they will use SpaceX's Crew Dragon or the Russian Soyuz spacecraft. Both these standby vehicles are already docked at the space station, so neither Sunita Williams nor the other eight astronauts are truly stranded in space.</p>

<p>NASA Commercial Crew Program Manager Steve Stich noted that the crew is in good spirits and making the most of their time on the station as part of Expedition 71, given that both Sunita and Butch have previously undertaken long-duration missions. He added that `contingency plans' are in place, but the current effort is focused on bringing both Sunita and Butch back to Earth on the Boeing Starliner itself.</p>

<p>Putting a brave face on the situation, Mark Nappi, Starliner program manager and vice president of Boeing, said, "I'm very confident we have a good vehicle [in Boeing Starliner] to bring the crew back with."</p>

<p>Boeing has encountered several setbacks during the Starliner's development. Originally contracted for $4.2 billion, the company has now spent approximately $5.7 billion, with the mission still incomplete. NASA sought a second alternative to SpaceX's Crew Dragon, which is why Boeing Starliner was being developed. Boeing is also facing broader difficulties, with its aviation and aircraft business stumbling, and recently, Boeing CEO David Calhoun was questioned by US Senators regarding the company's safety culture and transparency during a US Congress appearance. If the Boeing Starliner fails to return the two astronauts to Earth, it would represent a significant setback for this aerospace and space technology giant.</p>

<p>In a statement today, NASA said, 'With ground testing of a Reaction Control System (RCS) thruster complete and disassembly and inspections concluding, the Starliner team is reviewing data that will aid in future missions and pave the way for NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Sunita Williams to return to Earth. A landing date for the Starliner Crew Flight Test (CFT) will be scheduled following the Flight Test Readiness Review planned for later next week, with landing opportunities available throughout August. Testing of the RCS thruster at NASA's White Sands Test Facility in New Mexico yielded meaningful findings for root cause assessments and to finalise flight rationale in support of a nominal undock and landing.</p>

<p>The Starliner team plans to hot-fire 27 of 28 RCS thrusters this weekend while safely docked to the space station. This test aims to verify thruster performance, similar to what would be done during future missions. The team also seeks another data point on helium leaks, which have remained stable since the spacecraft's arrival at the station on June 6. The helium system has been closed for most of the time while docked, so no helium is leaking in that configuration.</p>

<p>Boeing, in a statement, said, 'Additionally, NASA and Boeing will conduct a second docked hot-fire test over the weekend to demonstrate the spacecraft's thruster performance. The first docked hot-fire test occurred on June 15. The upcoming test will allow checks of the helium leaks while also verifying that the thrusters are operating as expected.'</p>

<p>While some glitches were anticipated during this maiden test flight, the extension of a ten-day mission to over five times its expected duration, with no end date in sight, is deeply concerning for the global space community.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pakistan's jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan will apply for the post of Oxford University Chancellor, Imran's adviser on international affairs, Sayed Zulfi Bukhari told Geo News.</p>

<p>Mr Bukhari told the Pakistan-based media outlet on Thursday that the Chancellor's post became vacant after 80-year-old Lord Patten resigned following 21 years of service.</p>

<p>Mr Khan, an Oxford alumnus, will run for the post despite being in Adiala Jail in connection to several cases of corruption and incitement of violence after elections last year.</p>

<p>Former UK Prime Ministers Tony Blair and Boris Johnson are Imran Khan's opponents in the race to become Oxford University's Chancellor.</p>

<p>Mr Khan was a student of Economics and Politics at Keble College, Oxford in 1972. He was also the captain of the university's cricket team. He debuted for Pakistan's Test cricket team in 1971 and served as the chancellor of Bradford University from 2005 to 2014, Geo News reported.</p>

<p>Mr Bukhari told Geo News that there is public demand for Imran Khan's candidature.</p>

<p>"We will announce it publicly once we get a go-ahead from Khan and start the signature campaign for it. He's the most suited person right now for this post and we hope he will win the contest. We await approval from Khan and the campaign will begin," Geo News reported, quoting Imran Khan's international advisor.</p>

<p>The Chancellor of the Oxford University is a ceremonial head who presides over important events. The university invited online applications.</p>

<p>The Chancellor is elected by Convocation, a body made up of all former students of the University who have been admitted to a degree (other than an honorary degree), members of Congregation, and retired staff who were members of Congregation at retirement, the Oxford University website stated.</p>

<p>"I am proud of you. This is going to be historic," the former first lady told Harris.</p>

<p>Talking into a cell phone and cracking a few smiles, Harris expressed her gratitude for the endorsement and their long friendship.</p>

<p>"Thank you both. It means so much. And we're gonna have some fun with this too," Harris said.</p>

<p>The campaign said the video was the actual call, not a reenactment.</p>

<p>Harris's surprise bid against Republican rival Donald Trump continues to gain steam from supporters, donors and politicians less than a week after President Joe Biden bowed out of the race amid slumping poll numbers.</p>

<p>Obama, the first US Black president, remains one of the most popular figures in the Democratic party even after more than a decade has passed since he was last elected.</p>

<p>Obama has lent his support to Biden during big-money fundraisers, which were among some of the biggest blockbuster events of his campaign.</p>

<p>The endorsement could help activate and sustain energy and fundraising for Harris' campaign and it signals he is likely to get on the campaign trail for Harris once she is officially the presumptive nominee.</p>

<p>Obama initially withheld his endorsement even as Biden, his former vice president, anointed her as his heir apparent. Obama reportedly did not want to put his thumb on the scale as the party worked through the process of determining its nominee.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Paris is decked up to host a grand opening ceremony later today for the 2024 Olympics, but went into a tizzy after the rail network was crippled by "malicious acts".]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<ol>
	<li>Trains to and from Paris have been disrupted by what the government called a "massive attack aimed at paralyzing the network" of France's superfast trains.</li>
	<li>The "sabotage" occurred just hours before the opening ceremony of the 2024 Paris Olympics and has already affected over 8 lakh passengers.</li>
	<li>"Coordinated malicious acts targeted several TGV lines last night and will seriously disrupt traffic until this weekend," French Transport Minister Patrice Vergriete wrote on X (formerly Twitter).</li>
	<li>Fires were set off at several rail-line nodes, with people seen fleeing the sites in vans, Jean-Pierre Farandou, the head of the national rail company SNCF, said on BFM TV.</li>
	<li>"SNCF was the victim of several simultaneous malicious acts overnight. Arson attacks were started to damage our facilities," the national train operator said, adding that the attacks affected its Atlantic, northern, and eastern lines.</li>
	<li>SNCF urged passengers to postpone their trips and stay away from train stations.</li>
	<li>The train operator said that the situation would last through the weekend as they would have to repair the network cable by cable.</li>
	<li>International train operator Eurostar's services were also affected, especially those to London and Brussels from Paris.</li>
	<li>The disruptions come amid heightened security across Paris, with tens of thousands of police deployed to secure the Games. In preparation, large sections of the city have been cordoned off, with Olympic sites, train stations, and tourist landmarks guarded by gun-toting officers, including counter-terrorism units and the military.</li>
	<li>The opening ceremony this evening will see up to 7,500 competitors travel down a six-kilometre stretch of the river Seine on a flotilla of 85 boats.</li>

       <description><![CDATA[Four rockets fell in the vicinity" of Ain al-Assad base in Anbar province, an Iraqi security source said. Another security official said an attack occurred with "a drone and three rockets" that fell close to the base perimeter.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Several rockets were launched on Thursday and Friday against bases hosting troops from the US-led anti-jihadist coalition in Iraq and Syria, security officials and a war monitor said.</p>

<p>Such attacks were frequent early in the war between Israel and Hamas Palestinian militants in Gaza but since then have largely halted.</p>

<p>"Four rockets fell in the vicinity" of Ain al-Assad base in Anbar province, an Iraqi security source said.</p>

<p>Another security official said an attack occurred with "a drone and three rockets" that fell close to the base perimeter.</p>

<p>A United States official said initial reports indicated that projectiles landed outside the base without causing injuries or damage to the base.</p>

<p>All sources spoke on condition of anonymity because they are not authorised to speak to the media.</p>

<p>At least one rocket also fell near a base of the coalition in the Conoco gas field in Deir Ezzor province of eastern Syria, according to the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights war monitor.</p>

<p>The Observatory said a blast was heard in the area but there were no immediate reports of casualties.</p>

<p>The rocket was fired from "zones under the control of pro-Iranian militia" groups, said the monitor which relies on sources inside Syria.</p>

<p>There was no immediate claim of responsibility for either attack.</p>

<p>Iran-backed armed groups in Iraq have largely halted similar attacks on US-backed troops in recent months.</p>

<p>The latest attack come after a security meeting this week between Iraqi and US officials in Washington on the future of the international anti-jihadist coalition in Iraq. Iran-backed groups have demanded a withdrawal.</p>

<p>The US Defense Department said Wednesday "the delegations reached an understanding on the concept for a new phase of the bilateral security relationship".</p>

<p>This would include "cooperation through liaison officers, training, and traditional security cooperation programmes".</p>

<p>On July 16, two drones were launched against Ain al-Assad base, with one exploding inside without causing injuries or damage. A senior security official in Baghdad said at the time he believed the attack was meant to "embarrass" the Iraqi government before the security meeting.</p>

<p>For more than three months, as regional tensions soared over the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza, United States troops were targeted by rockets and drones more than 175 times in the Middle East, mainly in Iraq and Syria.</p>

<p>The Islamic Resistance of Iraq, a loose alliance of Iran-backed groups, claimed the majority of the attacks, saying they were in solidarity with Gaza Palestinians.</p>

<p>In January, a drone strike blamed on those groups killed three US soldiers in a base in Jordan. In retaliation, US forces launched dozens of strikes against Tehran-backed fighters.</p>

<p>Since then, attacks against US troops have largely halted.</p>

<p>Baghdad has sought to defuse tensions, engaging in talks with Washington on the future of the US-led coalition's mission in Iraq.</p>

<p>The US military has around 2,500 troops in Iraq and 900 in Syria with the international coalition.</p>

<p>The coalition was deployed to Iraq at the government's request in 2014 to help combat the Islamic State group, which had taken over vast swathes of Iraq and neighbouring Syria.</p>

<p>IS remnants still carry out attacks and ambushes in both countries.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Elon Musk's estranged transgender daughter, who he had alleged was "killed" by "woke mind virus", has "disowned" him. The world's richest man had claimed in a recent interview that during the pandemic, he was tricked into signing documents for "one of his older boys" Vivian Jenna Wilson. He had even referred to gender-reassignment surgery as "child mutilation and sterilisation".</p>

<p>Shot back Ms Wilson, the "entire thing was made up", in a long thread on Threads, the Meta micro-blogging rival to her father-owned X.</p>

<p>"I disowned him, not the other way around," said the 20-year-old.</p>

<p>She also shared the screenshot of an online post by Musk that claimed Wilson was born "gay and slightly autistic" - which the Tesla boss said were "attributes that contribute to gender dysphoria".</p>

<p>"I knew that from when he was about 4 years old and he would pick out clothes for me to wear like a jacket and tell me it was "fabulous!", as well as his love of musicals &amp; theatre. But he was not a girl," read Musk's post.</p>

<p>"This is entirely fake," shot back Wilson. "Like, literally none of this ever happened. Ever. I don't even know where he got this from. My best guess is that he went to the Milo Yiannopoulis school of gay stereotypes, just picked some at random and said "eh- good enough" in a last-ditch attempt to garner sympathy points when he is so obviously in the wrong even in his own fu**ing story."</p>

<p>Ms Wilson denied that she ever picked jackets for Musk.</p>

<p>"I was most certainly not calling them "fabulous" because literally what the f**k. I did not use the word fabulous when I was four because once again I would like to reiterate... I was four," she added.</p>

<p>She also claimed she did not have her father by her side when she was growing up.</p>

<p>"This entire thing is completely made up and there's a reason for this. He doesn't know what I was like as a child because he quite simply wasn't there, and in the little time that he was I was relentlessly harassed for my femininity and queerness. Obviously he can't say that, so I've been reduced to a happy little stereotype f*g-ing along to use at his discretion. I think that says alot about how he views queer people and children in general," said Ms Wilson.</p>

<p>She also sought to clear the air over her gender.</p>

<p>"I'm legally recognized as a woman in the state of California and I don't concern myself with the opinions of those who are below me. Obviously Elon can't say the same because in a ketamine-fueled haze, he's desperate for attention and validation from an army of degenerate red-pilled incels and pick-mes who are quick to give it to him," she said.</p>

<p>Musk had hit the headlines earlier this month with his claim about Wilson in an interview with conservative commentator Jordan Peterson. He had also accused those involved in promoting gender-affirming care of targeting children "who are far below the age of consent."</p>

<p>"I was tricked into doing this. I lost my son, essentially. They call it 'deadnaming' for a reason. The reason they call it 'deadnaming' is because your son is dead," he said, claiming that the experience set him on a mission to combat what he described as the "woke mind virus".</p>

<p>"I vowed to destroy the woke mind virus after that. And we're making some progress," he added.</p>

<p>Vivian Jenna Wilson had legally changed her name and gender at the age of 18. She had then asserted she does not wish to be related to Musk, her biological father. Her mother, Justine Wilson, had divorced Musk in 2008.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[There are people spending a lot of money to be on Santorini and they don't want the island to be swamped. Instagram has defined the way people choose the places to visit]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the most enduring images of Greece's summer travel brand is the world-famous sunset on Santorini Island, framed by sea-blue church domes on a jagged cliff high above a volcanic caldera.</p>

<p>This scene has inspired millions of fridge magnets, posters, and souvenirs -- and now the queue to reach the viewing spot in the clifftop village of Oia can take more than 20 minutes.</p>

<p>Santorini is a key stopover of the Greek cruise experience. But with parts of the island nearing saturation, officials are considering restrictions.</p>

<p>Of the record 32.7 million people who visited Greece last year, around 3.4 million, or one in 10, went to the island of just 15,500 residents.</p>

<p>"We need to set limits if we don't want to sink under overtourism," Santorini mayor Nikos Zorzos told AFP.</p>

<p>"There must not be a single extra bed... whether in the large hotels or Airbnb rentals."</p>

<p>As the sun set behind the horizon in Oia, thousands raised their phones to the sky to capture the moment, followed by scattered applause.</p>

<p>For canny entrepreneurs, the Cycladic island's famous sunset can be a cash cow.</p>

<p>One company advertised more than 50 "flying dresses", which have long flowing trains, for up to 370 euros ($401), on posters around Oia for anyone who wishes to "feel like a Greek goddess" or spruce up selfies.</p>

<h3><strong>'Respect Oia'</strong></h3>

<p>But elsewhere in Oia's narrow streets, residents have put up signs urging visitors to respect their home.</p>

<p>"RESPECT... It's your holiday... but it's our home," read a purple sign from the Save Oia group.</p>

<p>Shaped by a volcanic eruption 3,600 years ago, Santorini's landscape is "unique", the mayor said, and "should not be harmed by new infrastructure".</p>

<p>Around a fifth of the island is currently occupied by buildings.</p>

<p>At the edge of the cliff, a myriad of swimming pools and jacuzzis highlight Santorini is also a pricey destination.</p>

<p>In 2023, 800 cruise ships brought some 1.3 million passengers, according to the Hellenic Ports Association.</p>

<p>Cruise ships "do a lot of harm to the island", said Chantal Metakides, a Belgian resident of Santorini for 26 years.</p>

<p>"When there are eight or nine ships pumping out smoke, you can see the layer of pollution in the caldera," she said.</p>

<h3>- Cruise ship limits -</h3>

<p>In June, Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis floated the possibility of capping cruise ship arrivals to Greece's most popular islands.</p>

<p>"I think we'll do it next year," he told Bloomberg, noting that Santorini and tourist magnet Mykonos "are clearly suffering".</p>

<p>"There are people spending a lot of money to be on Santorini and they don't want the island to be swamped," said the pro-business conservative leader, who was re-elected to a second four-year term last year.</p>

<p>In an AFP interview, Tourism Minister Olga Kefalogianni echoed this sentiment and said: "We must set quotas because it's impossible for an island such as Santorini... to have five cruise ships arriving at the same time."</p>

<p>Local officials have set a limit of 8,000 cruise boat passengers per day from next year.</p>

<p>But not all local operators agree.</p>

<p>Antonis Pagonis, head of Santorini's hoteliers association, believes better visitor flow management is part of the solution.</p>

<p>"It is not possible to have (on) a Monday, for example, 20 to 25,000 guests from the cruise ships, and the next day zero," he said.</p>

<p>Pagonis also argued that most of the congestion only affects parts of the island like the capital, Fira.</p>

<p>In the south of the island, the volcanic sand beaches are less crowded, even though it is high season in July.</p>

<h3><strong>'I'm in Turkey'</strong></h3>

<p>The modern tourism industry has also changed visitor behaviour.</p>

<p>"I listened (to) people making a FaceTime call with the family, saying 'I'm in Turkey'," smiled tourist guide Kostas Sakavaras.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 30-year-old California man was caught soliciting sex from a sex worker while his 8-month-old child was in the backseat of his car.</p>

<p>He was arrested during an anti-human-trafficking operation on East Holt Avenue, according to the Pomona Police Department,&nbsp;<a href="https://ktla.com/news/local-news/pomona-man-caught-in-prostitution-sting-with-his-baby-in-backseat/ ">KTLA</a> reported.</p>

<p>Police found the infant unharmed in the backseat when they pulled the man over. The Department of Children and Family Services took custody of the child, and the father is cooperating with the investigation.</p>

<p>The man, whom police referred to as a "sex purchaser", is facing charges of prostitution and child endangerment.</p>

<p>This disturbing incident is just one example of California's ongoing struggle with human trafficking. In January this year, the 10th annual Operation Reclaim and Rebuild resulted in over 500 arrests and the rescue of dozens of individuals, including children, across the state. Pomona was one of the cities involved in the operation, which targeted human trafficking and child exploitation.</p>

<p>The operation, conducted by more than 95 federal, state, and local agencies, targeted human trafficking and child exploitation, reported <a href="https://abc7.com/california-human-trafficking-arrests-los-angeles-county-sex-workers-la/14372756/ ">ABC News</a>. Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna announced that 539 arrests, including that of 40 suspected sexual traffickers or exploiters and 271 suspected sex buyers, were made.</p>

<p>In one operation, task force personnel conducted an undercover "sex buyer" operation on Holt Avenue in Pomona, resulting in the arrest of 12 males, including two registered sex offenders, on suspicion of solicitation of prostitution.</p>

<p>Los Angeles County District Attorney George Gascon noted that one of the challenges in prosecuting sex traffickers and sex buyers was that victims were often too afraid to testify due to safety concerns. Mr Gascon assured that his office worked to ensure victims' safety and protection.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA["When I watched Dangal with Chinese subtitles a few years ago, I noticed an uncanny resemblance between the wrestlers' father and my own," says Chen Shih-hsin, Taiwan's first-ever Olympic gold medallist.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>"When I watched Dangal with Chinese subtitles a few years ago, I noticed an uncanny resemblance between the wrestlers' father and my own," says Chen Shih-hsin, Taiwan's first-ever Olympic gold medallist.</p>

<p>Chen clinched gold in the women's flyweight division (49-kilogram category) in Taekwondo at the 2004 Athens Olympics, ending a 72-year-long gold medal drought for Taiwan. Despite being a self-governing democracy with its own constitution and legislature, Taiwan competes at the Olympics under the fictitious name "Chinese Taipei" - it is neither part of China nor comprised solely of the city of Taipei (which is one of the 23 cities in the island nation).</p>

<p>"My father was a hard taskmaster, much like the father portrayed in the film. I feel he was even tougher on me," shares Chen as she teaches around 100 children at her Taekwondo school in the rural township of Xinfeng, near Taiwan's semiconductor hub, Hsinchu.</p>

<p>"Yes, you could call me a chip off the old block when it comes to inheriting my father's grit and toughness, similar to the characters in Dangal," admits Chen, whose life story is full of dramatic and emotional twists.</p>

<p>She is half-aboriginal, as her mother is from Taiwan's indigenous Atayal community. Her father, Chen Wei-hsiung, ran a Taekwondo training centre in Taipei and introduced her to martial arts at the age of five. By 15, Chen had already made a mark on the world stage by winning her debut appearance at the World Cup in the Cayman Islands in 1994. Two years later, she secured her second world title in Brazil.</p>

<p>However, her career took an unexpected turn shortly after. "I used to despise my father's relentless push. One day, at 18, I argued with him and ran away from home," Chen reveals, recalling her transformation from world champion to a "betel nut beauty" - a term for scantily-clad young women who sold betel nuts at kiosks across Taiwan.</p>

<p>After leaving her family and Taekwondo, Chen survived by vending betel nuts and other products in Taichung. "I felt like a rebel, much like the girl in the Bollywood movie who rebelled after joining the national team. But unlike her outspoken defiance, I simply left," shares Chen.</p>

<p>Three years later, a poignant line in a radio advertisement about a son unable to care for his ageing parents on their birthday led her to return home. Reuniting with her father, she pledged to resume her training and pursue an Olympic dream together. However, the three lost years cost her a chance to compete in the 2000 Sydney Olympics, where Taekwondo debuted as an Olympic medal sport.</p>

<p>"Being on my own for those three years strengthened me, helping me cope with the disappointment of missing the Sydney Games," Chen explains.</p>

<p>Her indomitable spirit and her father's unwavering support fuelled her strenuous preparation for the next four years. "When I reached Athens, my biggest adversary was myself, not my rivals from Cuba, Nepal, Canada, or Nicaragua," she reflects.</p>

<p>"The Olympic gold was our shared dream." Chen continues, "Opening a Taekwondo gym and running it for decades was as much my father's goal as it was mine. His ultimate aim was to bring an Olympic gold medal to the gym."</p>

<p>On August 26, Chen made history by defeating Cuban opponent Yanelis Labrada to win the first-ever gold medal for her "invisible" nation, herself, and most importantly, her father.</p>

<p>"Over the years, I've fought countless matches, shed many tears, and accumulated numerous injuries. That final match in Athens was worth it," she expresses.</p>

<p>At 25, Chen decided to retire. "These past twenty-odd years have been challenging, but I've been fortunate to avoid severe injuries thanks to my father's meticulous training," she notes.</p>

<p>Despite achieving her Olympic dream, Chen's life continued to resemble a gripping film script. She pursued a PhD in sports psychology, secured a position as an associate professor at a leading university, and started a family with two children. However, personal turmoil struck again.</p>

<p>An alleged extramarital affair with a fellow coach tarnished her reputation, forcing her to resign from her university post, leave her home, and yield custody of her daughter to her estranged husband. Yet, Chen rose from the ashes, relocating to Xinfeng with her son.</p>

<p>Today, Chen teaches Taekwondo to local children in her self-established dojang, away from the public eye and the bustle of Taipei. Although her Athens Olympic gold medal resides at her father's home, she now dreams of earning a gold medal for her Taekwondo school.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>France's high-speed rail network was hit by "malicious acts" including arson attacks that have disrupted the transport system, train operator SNCF said Friday, hours before the opening ceremony of the Paris Olympics.</p>

<p>A source close to the investigation told AFP the attacks were coordinated acts of "sabotage".</p>

<p>"This is a massive attack on a large scale to paralyse the TGV network," SNCF told AFP, adding that many routes will have to be cancelled.</p>

<p>"SNCF was the victim of several simultaneous malicious acts overnight," the national train operator said, adding that the attacks affected its Atlantic, northern and eastern lines.</p>

<p>"Arson attacks were started to damage our facilities," it said, adding that traffic on the affected lines was "heavily disrupted" and the situation would last through the weekend as repairs are conducted.</p>

<p>A "massive attack" against France's high-speed TGV rail network was an "outrageous criminal act", Transport Minister Patrice Vergriete said Friday, hours ahead of the Paris Olympics opening ceremony.</p>

<p>There would be "very serious consequences" for rail traffic throughout the weekend with connections towards northern, eastern and northwestern France halved, Vergriete said, while rail operator SNCF chief executive Jean-Pierre Farandou said 800,000 passengers were affected.</p>

<p>Trains were being diverted to different tracks "but we will have to cancel a large number of them", the statement said.</p>

<p>The southeastern line was not affected as "a malicious act was foiled".</p>

<p>SNCF urged passengers to postpone their trips and stay away from train stations.</p>

<h3><strong>Olympics under heavy security</strong></h3>

<p>The attacks were launched as Paris was under heavy security ahead of the opening ceremony of the Summer Olympics, with 300,000 spectators and an audience of VIPs expected at the event.</p>

<p>The parade on Friday evening will see up to 7,500 competitors travel down a six-kilometre (four-mile) stretch of the river Seine on a flotilla of 85 boats.</p>

<p>It will be the first time a Summer Olympics has opened outside the main athletics stadium, a decision fraught with danger at a time when France is on its highest alert for terror attacks.</p>

<p>At Paris's Montparnasse train station, dozens of passengers were waiting for more information about their trips after delays of 30 minutes to almost two hours were announced.</p>

<p>"Normal traffic is expected to resume on Monday, July 29," read one of the signs in the departure hall.</p>

<p>"We arrived around 7:00 am but we were told that we might not be able to leave before Monday," said 27-year-old student Jocelyn, who had planned to travel to Bretagne and refused to give her full name.</p>

<p>"We expected it to be a bit chaotic in Paris with the opening ceremony scheduled for this evening, but we didn't think it could be this bad," she said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Hamas leader in the West Bank died in Israeli custody, Palestinian authorities and the militant group said Friday.</p>

<p>Mustafa Muhammad Abu Ara, 63, died after being moved from a prison in southern Israel to a hospital, according to a joint statement by the Palestinian Authority's prisoners affairs body and the Palestinian Prisoners' Club watchdog.</p>

<p>"We mourn the passing of the leader and prisoner Sheikh Mustafa Muhammad Abu Ara and hold the occupation responsible for his assassination through deliberate medical neglect," Hamas said in a statement.</p>

<p>Abu Ara was arrested in October while suffering severe health problems, the Palestinian body and the watchdog said.</p>

<p>During his detainment he was subjected to torture and starvation, they added.</p>

<p>Israel's military did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>

<p>Palestinian authorities accused Israel this month of waging an abusive "war of revenge" against Palestinian detainees since the start of the Israel-Hamas war.</p>

<p>At the time, the Israeli military said it "rejects outright allegations concerning systematic abuse of detainees", adding that it acts within international law.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The United States had offered a $15 million reward for information leading to Zambada's arrest, accusing him of trafficking cocaine, heroin, methamphetamines and fentanyl]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ismael "Mayo" Zambada, the Sinaloa Cartel co-founder arrested Thursday in the United States, is one of Mexico's most-wanted drug traffickers who evaded justice for decades.</p>

<p>Before his startling capture in El Paso, Texas, the 76-year-old had never been to jail.</p>

<p>Despite his efforts to keep a low profile, the elusive boss was one of the US Drug Enforcement Administration's top targets.</p>

<p>The United States had offered a $15 million reward for information leading to Zambada's arrest, accusing him of trafficking cocaine, heroin, methamphetamines and fentanyl.</p>

<p>The bounty exceeded the $10 million offered for Nemesio "El Mencho" Oseguera, head of the rival Jalisco New Generation Cartel.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/mexican-drug-lord-el-mayo-and-el-chapos-son-arrested-in-us-6190402" target="_blank">Zambada</a> was detained Thursday along with Joaquin Guzman Lopez, a son of the Sinaloa Cartel's founder Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman, who is serving a life sentence in the United States.</p>

<p>Unlike Zambada, El Chapo was arrested three times before being extradited to the United States.</p>

<p>Zambada, who was born in the Sinaloa state capital Culiacan, was the long-time leader of a faction of the Sinaloa Cartel, according to US authorities.</p>

<p>He was "unique in that he has spent his entire adult life as a major international drug trafficker, yet he has never spent a day in jail," the US State Department said in 2021.</p>

<p>After El Chapo's arrest and extradition, Zambada became the "unquestioned senior leader of the Sinaloa Cartel," it added.</p>

<p>A former farmer, Zambada started working with the Juarez Cartel in the 1980s and 1990s.</p>

<p>After the death of that cartel's head Amado Carrillo Fuentes, he decided to create his own organization, according to the InSight Crime think tank.</p>

<p>In recent years, Zambada had been weakened by the arrests of his brother, two sons and a nephew, it noted.</p>

<p>Two of them even served as witnesses in El Chapo's trial in New York.</p>

<p>El Chapo's lawyers argued that the real leader of the cartel was Zambada.</p>

<p>Attorney Jeffrey Lichtman alleged that Zambada paid former Mexican president Enrique Pena Nieto a bribe of $100 million.</p>

<p>In 2017, Zambada survived an attack allegedly carried out by another Sinaloa Cartel leader.</p>

<p>In 2010, the veteran drug lord gave a brief interview to the Mexican magazine Proceso, which revealed that he had begun committing crimes at the age of 16.</p>

<p>Zambada said that he had come close to being captured by the Mexican army on several occasions.</p>

<p>But it was not until Thursday that he was finally taken into US custody in circumstances that were not immediately clear.</p>

<p>Zambada is, according to InSight Crime, "one of the most storied drug traffickers in Mexican history," known for maintaining a low profile and focusing on business over violence.</p>

<p>"In addition, he is one of the few old-guard bosses who has managed to evade justice throughout his criminal career," the think tank said before his detention.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ella Emhoff, the stepdaughter of US Vice President Kamala Harris, has defended her against a derogatory comment made by JD Vance, the running-mate of Republican nominee Donald Trump.</p>

<p>Vance called Harris a "childless cat lady" in a 2021 interview, which resurfaced after President Joe Biden recently endorsed Harris as the Democratic presidential nominee. Ms Emhoff swiftly responded to the remark on her Instagram Stories, writing, "How can you be 'childless' when you have cutie pie kids like Cole and I?"&nbsp;</p>

<p>She added, "I love my three parents."&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Kerstin Emhoff, Ella's mother, also spoke out against JD Vance's attacks on Kamala Harris, calling them "baseless". In a statement to NBC News, she said, "For over 10 years, since Cole and Ella were teenagers, Kamala has been a co-parent with Doug and me. She is loving, nurturing, fiercely protective, and always present. I love our blended family and am grateful to have her in it."</p>

<p><strong>Who is Ella Emhoff?</strong></p>

<p>Ella Emhoff, 25, is the daughter of Douglas Emhoff and Kerstin Emhoff, and the stepdaughter of Kamala Harris. She was 15 when her father married Harris in 2014, and has since considered her a third parent, affectionately calling her "Momala". Ella and her older brother, Cole, were named after jazz legends Ella Fitzgerald and Cole Porter.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ms Emhoff, a Parsons fashion student, has made a name for herself with her bold style and collaborations. She gained global attention with her Miu Miu coat and partnership with Batsheva Hay. Emhoff debuted at Paris Fashion Week for Balenciaga and has worked with top brands like Louis Vuitton, Calvin Klein and Stella McCartney.</p>

<p>Recently, the 25-year-old faced controversy when she posted a link to a fundraiser for <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/03/16/us-news/kamala-harris-stepdaughter-ella-emhoff-publicly-raising-money-for-unrwa-despite-alleged-terror-ties/">UNRWA</a>, an organisation aiding Palestinian refugees. The group was accused by Israel of hiring individuals linked to the October 7 Hamas attacks, leading to financial withdrawals from various countries. Although she removed the link, the incident reportedly sparked backlash from UN Watch.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA["This is going to increase as global warming continues, enhancing the chances of droughts and/or floods."]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Climate change is driving changes in rainfall patterns across the world, scientists said in a paper published on Friday, which could also be intensifying typhoons and other tropical storms.</p>

<p>Taiwan, the Philippines and then China were lashed by the year's most powerful typhoon this week, with schools, businesses and financial markets shut as wind speeds surged up to 227 kph (141 mph). On China's eastern coast, hundreds of thousands of people were evacuated ahead of landfall on Thursday.</p>

<p>Stronger tropical storms are part of a wider phenomenon of weather extremes driven by higher temperatures, scientists say.</p>

<p>Researchers led by Zhang Wenxia at the China Academy of Sciences studied historical meteorological data and found about 75% of the world's land area had seen a rise in "precipitation variability" or wider swings between wet and dry weather.</p>

<p>Warming temperatures have enhanced the ability of the atmosphere to hold moisture, which is causing wider fluctuations in rainfall, the researchers said in a paper published by the Science journal.</p>

<p>"(Variability) has increased in most places, including Australia, which means rainier rain periods and drier dry periods," said Steven Sherwood, a scientist at the Climate Change Research Centre at the University of New South Wales, who was not involved in the study.</p>

<p>"This is going to increase as global warming continues, enhancing the chances of droughts and/or floods."</p>

<h3>FEWER, BUT MORE INTENSE, STORMS</h3>

<p>Scientists believe that climate change is also reshaping the behaviour of tropical storms, including typhoons, making them less frequent but more powerful.</p>

<p>"I believe higher water vapour in the atmosphere is the ultimate cause of all of these tendencies toward more extreme hydrologic phenomena," Sherwood told Reuters.</p>

<p>Typhoon Gaemi, which first made landfall in Taiwan on Wednesday, was the strongest to hit the island in eight years.</p>

<p>While it is difficult to attribute individual weather events to climate change, models predict that global warming makes typhoons stronger, said Sachie Kanada, a researcher at Japan's Nagoya University.</p>

<p>"In general, warmer sea surface temperature is a favourable condition for tropical cyclone development," she said.</p>

<p>In its "blue paper" on climate change published this month, China said the number of typhoons in the Northwest Pacific and South China Sea had declined significantly since the 1990s, but they were getting stronger.</p>

<p>Taiwan also said in its climate change report published in May that climate change was likely to reduce the overall number of typhoons in the region while making each one more intense.</p>

<p>The decrease in the number of typhoons is due to the uneven pattern of ocean warming, with temperatures rising faster in the western Pacific than the east, said Feng Xiangbo, a tropical cyclone research scientist at the University of Reading.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An old comment by Donald Trump's running mate JD Vance - suggesting childless women are less fit to govern - has sparked a volley of criticism, the latest snap coming from actor Jennifer Aniston.</p>

<p>Vance had singled out Kamala Harris, now the Democratic Presidential nominee, among others during a 2021 interview and said those without offspring, especially "childless cat ladies", had no "direct stake" in the country.</p>

<p>Speaking to Tucker Carlson on Fox News, he had said the US was being run by "a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they've made and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable, too."</p>

<p>"It's just a basic fact. You look at Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, AOC; the entire future of the Democrats is controlled by people without children. And how does it make any sense that we've turned our country over to people who don't really have a direct stake in it?" Vance was heard saying in the resurfaced clip.</p>

<p>Kamala Harris has two stepchildren, Cole and Ella, with her husband Doug Emhoff and his first wife Kerstin Emhoff.</p>

<p>Vance's comments have drawn sexism charges ahead of the US Presidential elections that the Republicans were touted to win until President Joe Biden bowed out from the race.</p>

<p>Ms Aniston, pointing to her own infertility that she has been vocal about in the past, shared a screenshot of the clip on Instagram stories and said she couldn't believe this was coming from a potential US vice president.</p>

<p>"All I can say is...Mr. Vance, I pray that your daughter is fortunate enough to bear children of her own one day. I hope she will not need to turn to IVF as a second option. Because you are trying to take that away from her, too," Ms Aniston wrote in her post.</p>

<p>Kamala Harris's lack of biological children has been regarded as an issue by the Republicans, but she has received support from politicians, celebrities, and from her own family. Her supporters also pointed out that no US president has ever physically given birth, since all have been men.</p>

<p>Kerstin Emhoff, the mother of Harris' stepchildren, has slammed the attacks on the Vice President as "baseless" in a statement to CNN.</p>

<p>"For over 10 years, since Cole and Ella were teenagers, Kamala has been a co-parent with Doug and I. I love our blended family and am grateful to have her in it," she said.</p>

<p>"I love my three parents. How can you be 'childless' when you have cutie pie kids like cole and I," wrote Ella, 25, on Instagram.</p>

<p>"It would be funny if it wasn't so sad. My God, they went after 'cat people,' good luck with that," Minnesota Governor Tim Walz told MSNBC.</p>

<p>"Now, what the hell?" asked talk show host Whoopi Goldberg.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>55 years after it sank, killing 21 men, Australian scientists have finally located the shipwreck of the MV Noongah. According to the <em>BBC</em>, the huge freighter was carrying steel off the coast of New South Wales when it sank in rough seas in 1969, killing 21 of the 26 crew members on board. The incident sparked one of the biggest maritime searches in Australian history but the remains of 20 of the dead were never recovered. Now, MV Noongah has finally been found more than a half-century after it was lost at sea, Australian scientists announced on Thursday.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The location of the wreck was confirmed by Australia's science agency CSIRO, using high-resolution seafloor mapping and video footage. As per a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.csiro.au/en/news/All/News/2024/July/Wreck-of-MV-Noongah-identified">press release</a>, one of the agency's research vessels investigated the wreck in June and determined that, after almost 55 years, the ship was largely intact and situated in an upright position at the bottom of the ocean, roughly 550 feet below the surface. A dive team then explored the wreck up close to confirm its identity.</p>

<p>The Sydney Project - which finds and documents the wrecks of lost ships - is now planning a dive to collect additional vision from the site, in the hope of shedding light on why the ship sank.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"This tragedy is still very much in the memory of many in the community," CSIRO's Matt Kimber said, per the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd1eprng96eo"><em>BBC</em></a>. "We hope that knowing the resting place of the vessel brings some closure for all," he added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For 55 years, the researchers struggled to find MV Noongah. On the day the ship went down, its crew tried for hours to keep the vessel afloat before eventually abandoning it about 30 minutes before the ship sank completely. The radio operator sent out a distress signal around then, which prompted one of the largest search and rescue operations ever carried out in Australia.</p>

<p>Over the next 12 hours, officials found two men at sea in two separate life rafts, and three more clinging to a plank of wood. However, the fate of the rest of the crew and the ship itself has been a mystery ever since.</p>

<p>Notably, locals had spotted the shipwreck years ago in the water off the coast of South West Rocks, about 460 kilometres north of Sydney. However, the lack of technology or diving knowledge needed to identify the wreck stopped the endeavour.</p>

<p>Now, a half-century after the incident, the CSIRO located the location of the shipwreck. Samir Alhafith, who was part of the mission to find the wreck, said in a statement that knowing the ship's location may provide opportunities to answer some of those questions.</p>

<p>"Not only is the discovery of these significant wrecks important for the surviving sailors and families of those that perished during the tragedy but also it allows us to investigate the mystery behind the sinking," Mr Alhafith said.</p>

<p>Others involved in the project to locate the Noongah said they hope knowing where it is will provide a level of closure to those who knew the crew members lost at sea.</p>]]></content:encoded>

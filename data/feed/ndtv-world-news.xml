       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Italian island of Capri banned tourists from disembarking Saturday after problems with the water supply from the mainland threatened to leave the holiday hotspot parched.</p>

<p>The ban by Capri mayor Paolo Falco forced several ferries on their way to the island from Naples and Sorrento in southern Italy to turn back.</p>

<p>The company charged with supplying the island with water said there had been a technical problem on the mainland on Thursday, and while that had since been fixed problems with the supply to Capri remained.</p>

<p>Falco warned of "a real emergency" and said that while there was still water on most of the island on Friday, local tanks were "running out".</p>

<p>"The emergency would be worsened by the arrival of the thousands of tourists which arrive on Capri daily", he said.</p>

<p>Locals could collect up to 25 litres of drinking water per household from a supply tanker, he said.</p>

<p>The ban, which does not apply to residents, will be in place until further notice.</p>

<p>Capri, in the Bay of Naples, is famed for its white villas, cove-studded coastline and upscale hotels. There are some 13,000 permanent residents but huge numbers of day-trippers in summer months.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russia bombed a residential building in Ukraine's northeastern city of Kharkiv on Saturday, killing three people and wounding almost 30, as it stepped up its renewed hostilities.</p>

<p>Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky posted footage of the torn-off facade of an apartment block and a crater outside.</p>

<p>"Russian terrorists have again hit Kharkiv with guided bombs," he wrote on Telegram after the latest attack on Ukraine's second largest city, announcing three dead while rescuers still cleared debris.</p>

<p>Interior minister Igor Klymenko said there were 29 injured.</p>

<p>Regional governor Oleg Synegubov said two children had been hospitalised and "only civilian infrastructure was damaged".</p>

<p>Kharkiv is close to the border with Russia, which launched an offensive in the region in May, taking significant territory. It has increasingly targeted the city with air launched bombs.</p>

<p>In May, a guided bomb attack on a hardware store killed 16 people and wounded dozens.</p>

<p>Defence Minister Rustem Umerov said last month that Russia has dropped almost 10,000 guided bombs on Ukraine this year.</p>

<p>"This Russian terror with guided bombs must be stopped and can be stopped. We need strong decisions from our partners so that we can destroy Russian terrorists and Russian combat aircraft where they are," Zelensky said.</p>

<p>Russia also launched 16 cruise missiles and 13 attack drones at energy infrastructure in several regions, Ukraine's military said.</p>

<p>The Ukrainian energy ministry said this was Russia's "eighth massive, combined attack on energy infrastructure facilities" in three months.</p>

<p>More than two years into the Russian invasion, missile and drone attacks have crippled Ukraine's electricity generation capacity and forced Kyiv to impose blackouts and import supplies from the European Union.</p>

<p>Russia said its troops "carried out a group strike with long-range high-precision weaponry from air and sea and also drones on Ukrainian energy facilities that power arms production".</p>

<p>The defence ministry said strikes also targeted warehouses containing munitions and "air-launched weapons provided to the Ukrainian military by western countries".</p>

<p>"All the set targets were hit," the ministry said, justifying the strikes as retaliation for Ukrainian attacks on Russia's energy network.</p>

<p>Ukraine's energy ministry said equipment at operator Ukrenergo "facilities in the Zaporizhzhia and Lviv regions was damaged".</p>

<p>Maksym Kozytskyi, governor of the Lviv region, said one Russian attack started a fire at "a critical energy infrastructure facility".</p>

<p>Ukrenergo said two employees were wounded and hospitalised in Zaporizhzhia, where Europe's biggest nuclear plant is located.</p>

<p>Russian attacks have destroyed half of Ukraine's energy capacity, according to Zelensky.</p>

<p>He has repeatedly urged allies to send more air-defence systems to protect the country's vital infrastructure.</p>

<p>In southern Zaporizhzhia, Russian shelling killed one civilian and destroyed residential buildings and infrastructure, according to the regional military administration.</p>

<p>Russia controls a part of the region,including its nuclear plant.</p>

<p>The Russian-appointed administration said Ukrainian attacks had damaged a substation linked to the plant but did not compromise nuclear safety.</p>

<p><strong>Donetsk and Lugansk</strong></p>

<p>Frontline clashes were reported Saturday in the Donetsk region area near the towns of Pokrovsk and Toretsk, where Moscow "continues to increase the pace of offensive actions, deploying significant forces," Kyiv's military said.</p>

<p>Russia's defence ministry said troops had improved positions in the Donetsk and Lugansk regions and the Kharkiv region.</p>

<p>Five civilians were killed by Russian shelling in frontline areas of the Donetsk region, regional head Vadym Filashkin said.</p>

<p>In the southern Kherson region, a policeman manning a checkpoint was killed by a drone, Ukraine's police said.</p>

<p>The head of Russian authorities in the Donetsk region, Denis Pushilin, said the separatist-controlled city of Donetsk and the nearby town of Gorlivka had come under heavy attack from Ukraine.</p>

<p>Three men working for a construction firm were killed by a rocket releasing cluster munitions, he said.</p>

<p>Three more were wounded by a drone attack on a civilian minibus, Pushilin added, and another man was wounded by an anti-personnel mine.</p>

<p>In Russia's southern Belgorod region, a man was killed in the shelling of an business near the border with Ukraine's Kharkiv, said governor Vyacheslav Gladkov.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Days after Israel announced a daily pause in fighting on a key route to allow more aid into Gaza, chaos in the besieged Palestinian territory has left vital supplies piled up and undistributed in the searing summer heat.</p>

<p>More than eight months of war, sparked by Hamas's unprecedented October 7 attack on Israel, have led to dire humanitarian conditions in the Gaza Strip and repeated UN warnings of famine.</p>

<p>Desperation among Gaza's 2.4 million population has increased as fighting rages, sparking warnings from agencies that they are unable to deliver aid.</p>

<p>Israel says it has let supplies in and called on agencies to step up deliveries.</p>

<p>"The breakdown of public order and safety is increasingly endangering humanitarian workers and operations in Gaza," the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, OCHA, said in a briefing late Friday.</p>

<p>"Alongside the fighting, criminal activities and the risk of theft and robbery has effectively prevented humanitarian access to critical locations."</p>

<p>But Israel says it has allowed hundreds of trucks of aid into southern Gaza, trading blame with the United Nations over why the aid is stacking up.</p>

<p>It shared aerial footage of containers lined up on the Gazan side of the Kerem Shalom crossing and more trucks arriving to add to the stockpile.</p>

<p>The October Hamas attack on Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,194 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures.</p>

<p>The militants also seized 251 hostages, 116 of whom remain in Gaza although the army says 41 are dead.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory offensive in Gaza has killed at least 37,551 people, also mostly civilians, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-ruled territory.</p>

<p><strong>The blame game</strong></p>

<p>With civil order breaking down in Gaza, the UN says it has been unable to pick up any supplies from Kerem Shalom since Tuesday, leaving crucial aid in limbo.</p>

<p>A deputy UN spokesman this week said the crossing "is operating with limited functionality, including because of fighting in the area".</p>

<p>William Schomburg, International Committee of the Red Cross chief in Rafah, said arranging lorries from the Egyptian side in particular was complicated.</p>

<p>"It's not just a question of civil order, but also the fact that you often have to cross battlefields," he said in an online briefing, adding that the area near Kerem Shalom had been hostile.</p>

<p>"There were even rockets fired nearby. So this whole area is particularly complicated to navigate for reasons linked to the hostilities and for reasons linked to general security."</p>

<p>Israel's coordinator for civilian affairs in the Palestinian territories, known as COGAT, said Thursday "the content of 1,200 aid trucks awaits collection by UN aid agencies", saying a lack of distribution was responsible.</p>

<p>Earlier in the week, COGAT spokesman Shimon Freedman told reporters at the crossing the daily pause on a southern road into Gaza was designed to allow the UN "to collect and distribute more aid" alongside an Israeli military presence.</p>

<p>He said most of the aid had not moved because "organisations have not taken sufficient steps to improve their distribution capacity".</p>

<p><strong>'Don't see any aid'</strong></p>

<p>Aid agencies have instead pointed to Israel's offensive on the southern city of Rafah, which pushed out more than a million people and closed a border crossing with Egypt, as a deepening humanitarian crisis hampered relief efforts.</p>

<p>Schomburg described Rafah City as a "ghost town".</p>

<p>"It is a ghost town in the sense that you see very few people, high levels of destruction, and really just another symbol of the unfolding tragedy that has become Gaza over the last nine months," he said.</p>

<p>The UN food agency has said its aid convoys have been looted inside Gaza by "desperate people".</p>

<p>As both sides stall, it is the civilians in Gaza who are paying the price.</p>

<p>"We don't see any aid. Everything we get to eat comes from our own money and it's all very expensive," said Umm Mohammad Zamlat, 66, from northern Gaza but now living in Khan Yunis in the south.</p>

<p>"Even agencies specialised in aid deliveries are not able to provide anything to us," she added.</p>

<p>NGO Doctors Without Borders said on Friday that six trucks with 37 tons of supplies, mostly essentially medical items, have been held up at the Egyptian part of Kerem Shalom since June 14.</p>

<p>"This is incomprehensible and unacceptable," a statement said.</p>

<p>"It's like asking a fireman to watch a house filled with people burn down, and preventing him putting out the fire."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A French-Chinese satellite blasted off Saturday on a hunt for the mightiest explosions in the universe, in a notable example of cooperation between a Western power and the Asian giant.</p>

<p>Developed by engineers from both countries, the Space Variable Objects Monitor (SVOM) is carrying four instruments -- two French, two Chinese -- that will seek out gamma-ray bursts, the light from which has travelled billions of light years to reach Earth.</p>

<p>The 930-kilogram (2,050-pound) satellite "successfully" took off around 3:00 pm (0700 GMT) aboard a Chinese Long March 2-C rocket from a space base in Xichang, in southwestern Sichuan province, China's National Space Administration said.</p>

<p>Gamma-ray bursts generally occur after the explosion of huge stars -- those more than 20 times as big as the sun -- or the fusion of compact stars.</p>

<p>The extremely bright cosmic beams can give off a blast of energy equivalent to more than a billion billion suns.</p>

<p>Observing them is like "looking back in time, as the light from these objects takes a long time to reach us", Ore Gottlieb, an astrophysicist at the Flatiron Institute's Center for Astrophysics in New York, told AFP.</p>

<p><strong>'Several mysteries'</strong></p>

<p>The rays carry traces of the gas clouds and galaxies they pass through on their journey through space -- valuable data for better understanding the history and evolution of the universe.</p>

<p>"SVOM has the potential to unravel several mysteries in the field of (gamma-ray bursts), including detecting the most distant GRBs in the universe, which correspond to the earliest GRBs," Gottlieb said.</p>

<p>The most distant bursts identified to date were produced just 630 million years after the Big Bang -- when the universe was in its infancy.</p>

<p>"We are... interested in gamma-ray bursts for their own sake because they are very extreme cosmic explosions which allow us to better understand the death of certain stars," said Frederic Daigne, an astrophysicist at the Paris Institute of Astrophysics.</p>

<p>"All of this data makes it possible to test the laws of physics with phenomena that are impossible to reproduce in the laboratory on Earth."</p>

<p>Once analysed, the data could help to improve understanding of the composition of space, and the dynamics of gas clouds or other galaxies.</p>

<p>The project stems from a partnership between the French and Chinese space agencies as well as other scientific and technical groups from both nations.</p>

<p>"It's a great success. We've managed to work well with our Chinese colleagues," Philippe Baptiste, CEO of France's CNES space agency, told AFP after the launch.</p>

<p>Space cooperation at this level between the West and China is fairly uncommon, especially since the United States banned all collaboration between NASA and Beijing in 2011.</p>

<p><strong>Race against time</strong></p>

<p>"US concerns on technology transfer have inhibited US allies from collaborating with the Chinese very much, but it does happen occasionally," said Jonathan McDowell, an astronomer at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in the United States.</p>

<p>In 2018, China and France jointly launched CFOSAT, an oceanographic satellite mainly used in marine meteorology.</p>

<p>Several European countries have also taken part in China's Chang'e lunar exploration programme.</p>

<p>So while SVOM is "by no means unique", it remains "significant" in the context of space collaboration between China and the West, said McDowell.</p>

<p>Once in orbit 625 kilometres (388 miles) above the Earth, the satellite will send its data back to observatories.</p>

<p>The main challenge is that gamma-ray bursts are extremely brief, leaving scientists in a race against time to gather information.</p>

<p>Once it detects a burst, SVOM will send an alert to a team on duty around the clock.</p>

<p>Within five minutes, they will have to rev up a network of telescopes on the ground that will align precisely with the axis of the burst's source to make more detailed observations.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Egyptian Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly on Saturday ordered 16 tourism companies stripped of their licences and referred their managers to the public prosecutor's office for illegally facilitating pilgrims' travel to Mecca, the cabinet said.</p>

<p>The order came after various countries reported more than 1,100 deaths, many attributed to high heat, during this year's hajj.</p>

<p>Arab diplomats told AFP earlier this week that Egyptians accounted for 658 deaths, 630 of them unregistered pilgrims.</p>

<p>"The prime minister has ordered the licences of these companies to be revoked, their managers to be referred to the public prosecutor and the imposition of a fine to benefit the families of the pilgrims who died because of them," the Egyptian cabinet said in a statement.</p>

<p>It said the rise in the deaths of unregistered Egyptian pilgrims stemmed from some companies which "organised the hajj programmes using a personal visit visa, which prevents its holders from entering Mecca" via official channels.</p>

<p>On Friday a senior Saudi official defended the Gulf kingdom's management of the pilgrimage.</p>

<p>Hajj permits are allocated to countries on a quota system and distributed to individuals via a lottery.</p>

<p>Even for those who can obtain them, the steep costs spur many pilgrims to attempt the hajj without a permit, though they risk arrest and deportation if caught by Saudi security forces.</p>

<p>The irregular route, which can save pilgrims thousands of dollars, has become increasingly popular since 2019 when Saudi Arabia introduced a general tourism visa which has made it easier to enter the Gulf kingdom.</p>

<p>The senior official said the Saudi government had confirmed 577 deaths for the two busiest days of hajj: Saturday, when pilgrims gathered for hours of prayers in the blazing sun on Mount Arafat, and Sunday, when they participated in the "stoning of the devil" ritual in Mina.</p>

<p>"This happened amid difficult weather conditions and a very harsh temperature," the official said, while acknowledging that the 577 figure was partial and did not cover all of hajj, which formally ended on Wednesday.</p>

<p>The hajj is one of the five pillars of Islam, and all Muslims with the means must complete it at least once in their lives.</p>

<p>Saudi officials had earlier said 1.8 million pilgrims took part this year, a similar total to last year, and that 1.6 million came from abroad.</p>

<p>The timing of the hajj is determined by the Islamic lunar calendar, shifting forward each year in the Gregorian calendar.</p>

<p>For the past several years the mainly outdoor rituals have fallen during the sweltering Saudi summer.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With many Israelis gripped by a sense of insecurity following Hamas's unprecedented October 7 attack, the number of women applying for gun permits has soared, while feminist groups have criticised the rush to arms.</p>

<p>According to security ministry data, there have been 42,000 applications by women for gun permits since the attack, with 18,000 approved, more than tripling the number of pre-war licenses held by women.</p>

<p>The surge has been enabled by the loosening of gun laws under Israel's right-wing government and its far-right security minister Itamar Ben Gvir.</p>

<p>More than 15,000 women civilians now own a firearm in Israel and the occupied West Bank, with 10,000 enrolled in mandatory training, according to the ministry.</p>

<p>"I would have never thought of buying a weapon or getting a permit, but since October 7, things changed a little bit," political science professor Limor Gonen told AFP during a weapons handling class at a shooting range in the West Bank settlement of Ariel.</p>

<p>The October 7 attack that triggered the war resulted in the deaths of 1,194 people in Israel, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 37,431 people in Gaza, also mostly civilians, according to the territory's health ministry.</p>

<p>"We were all targeted (on October 7) and I don't want to be taken by surprise, so I'm trying to defend myself," Gonen said after the class, an obligatory step for acquiring a permit.</p>

<p><strong>100,000 armed civilians</strong></p>

<p>While the immediate trigger for the surge in gun buying was the Hamas attack, Ben Gvir was already pledging to reform firearms legislation when he became security minister in late 2022.</p>

<p>He promised to raise the number of civilians holding weapons and "increase self-defence capacity".</p>

<p>Under Ben Gvir, the process for getting a gun license has been sped up, with Israeli media reporting that in the immediate aftermath of the Hamas attack the authorities were often clearing hundreds of permits per day.</p>

<p>Eligibility criteria for gun ownership in Israel now include being a citizen or permanent resident over the age of 18, having a basic command of Hebrew and medical clearance.</p>

<p>The full list of requirements makes it nearly impossible for non-Jews to obtain a permit.</p>

<p>In March, Ben Gvir, who is himself a settler in the West Bank, hailed civilian weapon ownership passing the 100,000 mark, while showing off his own gun at a rally.</p>

<p>But his rush to put deadly arms into the hands of ordinary Israelis has drawn criticism too.</p>

<p>The Gun Free Kitchen Tables Coalition, an Israeli initiative founded by feminist activists, condemned the civilian arms race.</p>

<p>It is "a strategy of far-right settlers to consider the arming of women to be a feminist act", a spokesperson for the group of 18 organisations told AFP.</p>

<p>"The increase of weapons in the civilian space leads to an increase in violence and murder against women. It's time for the state to understand that individual safety is its responsibility."</p>

<p><strong>'More safe'</strong></p>

<p>Community manager Yahel Reznik, 24, said she now felt "a lot more safe" in Ariel, which sits three kilometres north of the Palestinian city of Salfit.</p>

<p>"Thanks to my training I will be able to defend myself and protect others" from an attack, she told AFP.</p>

<p>Violence in the West Bank, which was already rising before the war, has surged since October 7.</p>

<p>At least 549 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli settlers and troops across the West Bank since the start of the Gaza war, according to the Palestinian Authority.</p>

<p>Attacks by Palestinians have killed at least 14 Israelis, according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures.</p>

<p>The surge in gun ownership is not limited to West Bank settlers. In the Israeli coastal city of Netanya, just north of Tel Aviv, Corine Nissim said she never leaves home without her gun.</p>

<p>The 42-year-old English teacher walked her three children to the park with a 9mm Smith &amp; Wesson sticking out the back of her trousers.</p>

<p>"After October 7, I think like most people in Israel, I realised that the only person I can trust is myself," she told AFP, adding she bought a gun not to feel "helpless".</p>

<p>"The worst scenario that was going through my head was that, of course, terrorists attack me and my family in our own house," the mother said.</p>

<p>Her decision to own a gun initially surprised some in the seaside town known for its tranquillity and safety, she said.</p>

<p>"People watched me and said, 'This is so surreal to see you like this with a gun and with the baby'" said Nissim.</p>

<p>But, she said, others started to agree with her and said they would follow suit.</p>

<p>"Many women told me: 'I'm going to do it. I'm going to get a gun as well.'"</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Softening his stance on immigration, former US President Donald Trump has promised to give automatic green cards to foreign students who graduate from US colleges to prevent them from returning to their home countries like India and China where they become multibillionaires.</p>

<p>Trump's departure from the anti-immigrant rhetoric comes ahead of the November presidential election in which immigration and deportation of illegal immigrants are among the key issues for voters.</p>

<p>Trump, however, always supported a merit-based legal immigration system.</p>

<p>"What I want to do and what I will do is --you graduate from a college, I think you should get a Green Card automatically as part of your diploma, a Green Card to be able to stay in this country. And that includes junior colleges too," Trump, 78, said in the "All-In" podcast.</p>

<p>A Green Card, known officially as a permanent resident card, is an identity document showing a person has permanent residency in the United States.</p>

<p>The podcast was hosted by four venture capitalists: Chamath Palihapitiya, Jason Calacanis, David Sacks, and David Friedberg, three of whom are immigrants.</p>

<p>Trump's remarks came as he was pressed by Calacanis to "promise us you will give us more ability to import the best and brightest around the world to America." Trump, the presumptive candidate from the Republican Party, also lamented "stories where people graduated from a top college or from a college, and they desperately wanted to stay here, they had a plan for a company, a concept, and they can't - they go back to India, they go back to China, they do the same basic company in those places.</p>

<p>"...and they become multi-billionaires employing thousands and thousands of people, and it could have been done here," he said.</p>

<p>"Let me just tell you that it's so sad when we lose people from Harvard, MIT, from the greatest schools. and lesser schools that are phenomenal schools also. And what I wanted to do, and I would have done this, but then we had to solve the COVID problem because that came in and, you know, sort of dominated for a little while, as you perhaps know," Trump said in response.</p>

<p>Trump reiterated his first-term policy, about foreign students getting a Green Card after receiving a degree from a higher education institution in the STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) field.</p>

<p>"Anybody graduates from a college, you go in there for two years or four years, If you graduate or you get a doctorate degree from a college, you should be able to stay in this country," Trump said.</p>

<p>"We force the brilliant people, the people that graduate from college, the people that are number one in their class from the best colleges, you have to be able to recruit these people and keep the people," he asserted.</p>

<p>Somebody graduates at the top of the class; they can't even make a deal with the company because they don't think they're going to be able to stay in the country.</p>

<p>"That is going to end on day one," Trump announced.</p>

<p>According to the latest annual Open Doors report of the Institute of International Education more than a million international students from more than 210 places of origin are studying at US higher education institutions during the 2022-23 academic year.</p>

<p>China remained the top-sending country in 2022/23, with 289,526 students studying in the U.S. But students from China saw a slight decline of 0.2 per cent compared to the previous year.</p>

<p>India, the second largest sending country, reached an all-time high of 268,923 international students in 2022/23, an increase of 35 per cent as against the previous year. Overall 53 per cent of all international students in 2022/23 were from China and India, comparable to the prior year.</p>

<p>However, the market share for each place of origin has shifted, with 27 per cent of students from China and 25 per cent of students from India, in comparison to 33 per cent from China and 18 per cent from India in 2017-18. Trump's latest comments stood in contrast to the immigration policy he adopted while in office and were a direct overture to wealthy business leaders whom he is courting as donors and supporters of his campaign, The New York Times said.</p>

<p>Trump had at times sought to reform the nation's immigration system to scale back family-based immigration and to prioritise wealthy immigrants, who had valuable work skills or who were highly educated.</p>

<p>But during his term as president, Trump's immigration agenda included restrictions on green cards, visa programmes, refugee resettlement and other forms of legal immigration, significantly reducing the number of lawful permanent residents entering the country.</p>

<p>He began his presidency by signing an executive order that banned travellers from seven predominantly Muslim countries and later embraced a proposal to cut legal immigration by half.</p>

<p>Throughout his presidency, Trump assailed the H-1B visa programme, favoured by tech companies as a way to hire foreign skilled workers, as a "theft of American prosperity." The H-1B visa is a non-immigrant visa that allows US companies to employ foreign workers in speciality occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise.</p>

<p>Technology companies depend on it to hire tens of thousands of employees each year from countries like India and China.</p>

<p>Trump expanded restrictions on legal immigration during the pandemic and his last year in office and had proposed suspending all immigration to the United States and deporting foreign students if they did not attend at least some classes in person.</p>

<p>A month before the 2020 election, Trump again moved to restrict the H-1B visa programme.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Britains wealthiest family, the Hindujas, have said they were "appalled" by a Swiss courts ruling of jail terms for some members and have filed an appeal in a higher court challenging the verdict finding them guilty of exploiting workers.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Britain's wealthiest family, the Hindujas, have said they were “appalled” by a Swiss court's ruling of jail terms for some members and have filed an appeal in a higher court challenging the verdict finding them guilty of exploiting vulnerable domestic workers from India at their villa in Geneva.</p>

<p>In a statement issued on behalf of the family on Friday, lawyers from Switzerland stressed their clients – Prakash and Kamal Hinduja, both in their 70s and their son Ajay and his wife Namrata – had been acquitted of all human trafficking charges.</p>

<p>They also dismissed media reports that any members of the family faced detention after court reports from Geneva said the four were sentenced to between four and four-and-a-half years in prison.</p>

<p>“Our clients have been acquitted of all human trafficking charges. We are appalled and disappointed by the rest of the decision made in this court of first instance, and we have, of course, filed an appeal to the higher court, thereby making this part of the judgement not effective,” reads the statement signed by lawyers Yael Hayat and Robert Assael and Roman Jordan.</p>

<p>“Under Swiss law, the presumption of innocence is paramount till a final judgement by the highest adjudicating authority is enforced. Contrary to some media reports, there is no effective detention for any members of the family,” they said.</p>

<p>The lawyers also pointed out that “it should also be recalled that the plaintiffs in this case had withdrawn their respective complaints after declaring to the court that they had never intended to be involved in such proceedings”.</p>

<p>“The family has full faith in the judicial process and remains confident that the truth will prevail,” they conclude.</p>

<p>The statement followed a hearing in the Swiss city of Geneva after prosecutors opened the case for alleged illegal activity, including exploitation, human trafficking and violation of Switzerland's labour laws.</p>

<p>The family members were accused of seizing the workers' passports, barring them from leaving the villa and forcing them to work very long hours for a pittance in Switzerland, among other things.</p>

<p>Some workers allegedly spoke only Hindi and were paid their wages in rupees in banks back in India that they could not access.</p>

<p>During the trial, prosecutors alleged the family spent more on their dog than on their servants.</p>

<p>The family's legal team had countered the allegations and told the court the staff were treated respectfully and provided with accommodation.</p>

<p>According to ‘The Sunday Times Rich List' released last month, the UK-based Hinduja family once again emerged as the country's richest, with wealth estimated at around GBP 37.196 billion.</p>

<p>They saw this tally increase over the previous year in the wake of the opening of the brand-new luxury OWO Raffles Hotel in the heart of London.</p>

<p>The UK-based family's group of companies, headed by chairman G.P. Hinduja, operates in 48 countries and across several sectors – automotive, oil and specialty chemicals, banking and finance, IT, cyber security, healthcare, trading, infrastructure project development, media and entertainment, power, and real estate.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The American space agency NASA has confirmed that the return of the Indian origin astronaut Sunita Williams from the International Space Station (ISS) has been further delayed and no new date has been set for her "happy landing".]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The American space agency NASA has confirmed that the return of Indian origin astronaut Sunita Williams from the International Space Station (ISS) has been further delayed and no new date has been set for her "happy landing".</p>

<p>This comes as the spacecraft in which she travelled to space, the Boeing Starliner, has been facing a series of glitches. Sunita Williams and her co-passenger Butch Wilmore are both safe on the ISS along with the seven other crew members who inhabit the "mini-city in space" - the ISS.</p>

<p>Riding atop the Boeing Starliner on its maiden mission, Ms Williams reached the ISS on June 5 on what was to be possibly a 10-day mission but since then it has been extended twice thanks to issues with the small rockets that help the crew module return to Earth, and a series of Helium leaks that bedevil the Boeing Starliner on its first crewed flight.</p>

<p>NASA says the crew is not pressed for time to leave the station since there are plenty of supplies in orbit, and the station's schedule is relatively open through mid-August.</p>

<p>Initially, Ms Williams was to return potentially on June 14, this was scrapped and a new date June 26 was set by NASA, this has also been postponed and a new date has not been announced yet.</p>

<p>"NASA and Boeing leadership are adjusting the return to Earth of the Starliner Crew Flight Test spacecraft with agency astronauts. The move off Wednesday, June 26, deconflicts Starliner's undocking and landing from a series of planned International Space Station spacewalks while allowing mission teams time to review propulsion system data," a statement said.</p>

<p>Five of the 28 thrusters on the Boeing Starliner are having issues and there have been five Helium leaks on the space craft. Experts say a minimum of 14 thrusters are required for a safe return.</p>

<p>Boeing says, "Starliner has completed 77 of the original 87 flight-test objectives, with the remaining 10 will occur between undocking and landing."</p>

<p>NASA says mission managers are evaluating future return opportunities following the station's two planned spacewalks on Monday, June 24, and Tuesday, July 2. So it could well be nearly a month long stay for Ms Williams in space on her third mission to space.</p>

<p>"Starliner is performing well in orbit while docked to the space station," said Steve Stich, manager of NASA's Commercial Crew Program</p>

<p>"We are strategically using the extra time to clear a path for some critical station activities while completing readiness for Butch and Suni's return on Starliner and gaining valuable insight into the system upgrades we will want to make for post-certification missions."</p>

<p>Boeing has faced several hiccups in the Starliner development and initially it was to have completed this with a $4.2 billion contract but has now spent a total of about $ 5.7 billion and the going is still uphill as the mission remains incomplete.</p>

<p>NASA wanted a second alternative to SpaceX's Crew Dragon and hence Boeing Starliner was being pushed through. Boeing is going through a bad patch in general and its aviation and aircraft business has also been stumbling.</p>

<p>NASA says Wilmore and Williams remain integrated with the Expedition 71 crew, assisting with station operations as needed and completing add-on in-flight objectives for NASA certification of Starliner.</p>

<p>Ms Williams is a qualified navy test pilot she had flown twice earlier to space in 2006 and 2012 and according to data from NASA, before this Starliner mission Sunita has already spent a cumulative total of 322 days in space.</p>

<p>"With seven space walks totalling 50 hours and 40 minutes, Sunita held the record for total cumulative spacewalk time by a female astronaut but that has since been overtaken by Peggy Whitson with 10 spacewalks."</p>

<p>Ms Williams has helped design the Boeing Starliner so she should be familiar with all its details.</p>

<p><strong>Such Delays Not Unforeseen on Maiden Missions</strong></p>

<p>"We are taking our time and following our standard mission management team process," said Stich.</p>

<p>"We are letting the data drive our decision making relative to managing the small helium system leaks and thruster performance we observed during rendezvous and docking. Additionally, given the duration of the mission, it is appropriate for us to complete an agency-level review, similar to what was done ahead of the NASA's SpaceX Demo-2 return after two months on orbit, to document the agency's formal acceptance on proceeding as planned."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the space fairing community prays for the safe return of Ms Williams and Mr Wilmore, but it could be embarrassing for Boeing if SpaceX's Crew Dragon were to be used to rescue the astronauts stuck at the space station.</p>

<p>"The crew's feedback has been overwhelmingly positive, and they know that every bit of learning we do on the Crew Flight Test will improve and sharpen our experience for future crews," said Mark Nappi, vice president and program manager, Boeing's Starliner Program.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An Australian woman who owns a gym faked her own death to claim a nearly $500,000 insurance payout as part of an elaborate scheme where she posed as her partner. According to the New York Post, the woman, identified as 42-year-old Karen Salkilld, was arrested in March after filing the insurance claim in her partner's name, falsely saying she had died in a car accident. The claim included a series of fabricated documents, including a death certificate, a Coroner's Court of Western Australia delegate letter and an investigation record into a death.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/06/21/lifestyle/gym-owner-karen-salkilld-faked-own-death-posed-as-partner-to-claim-nearly-500k-insurance-payout/#:~:text=A%20gym%20owner%20faked%20her,a%20car%20accident%20in%20Broome."><em>Post </em></a>reported that the insurance company transferred $477,520 into a bank account that the 42-year-old had set up in her partner's name. In the following days, the fitness instructor made several payments from the account. However, the scheme began to unravel when Ms Salkilld's bank flagged and subsequently froze the suspicious account.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Then, in a desperate bid to access the funds, Ms Salkilld visited Palmyra Police Station with several forms of ID that had been certified by an officer. However, as these copies were altered before being submitted to the bank, they didn't pass the verification process.&nbsp;</p>

Startled, she then replied: "What the hell? Who are you guys? I'm not talking to you guys."</p>

<p>The reporter went on: "How did you think you could get away with it? You're charged with serious fraud offences." Ms Salkilld then responded, "Is this a joke?".</p>

<p>Ms Salkilld was arrested in March and pleaded guilty to the two offences in her first appearance in front of a magistrate. She faces up to seven years in jail for offences of gains benefit by fraud and intent to defraud knowingly using any record which is false. She is due to be sentenced in Perth District Court next month.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Paying a visit to the world's most terrifying places may sound like a nightmare for many, but some globe-trotters consider it adventurous. If you are one of those, we have a list of 10 spine-chilling places that you might want to explore.</p>

<p>Here are 10 of the world's most terrifying places:</p>

<h2><strong>1. Nagoro, Japan</strong></h2>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont">

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Nagoro is a small village in Japan full of life-sized dolls. These dolls outnumber humans by nearly 10 to 1. Local artist Tsukimi Ayano had started creating lookalike&nbsp;dolls&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 13px;">of her dead neighbours or those who had shifted to a different location. In the village, there are about 350 dolls and 27 humans -- something enough to describe the place as a terrifying toyland.</span></p>

<h2><strong>2. Centralia, Pennsylvania</strong></h2>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-06/ohm9hkf_centralia-_625x300_22_June_24.jpeg?im=FaceCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=1200,height=738" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>Back in 1962, a coal mine mysteriously caught fire in Centralia. A few years later, similar isolated incidents occurred - a gas station owner reported dangerously high gasoline temperatures in his underground tanks in 1979, and a boy nearly fell into a 150-foot-deep sinkhole in 1981. After these occurrences, residents started migrating to other locations. As of today, the town has many torn-down buildings and crumbled sidewalks. One might even see smoke coming out from the subterranean fires, which, as per scientists, will continue to burn for another 250 years.</p>

<h2><strong>3. Gomantong Caves, Malaysia</strong></h2>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-06/315l8v5_gomantong-caves_625x300_22_June_24.jpeg?im=FaceCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=1200,height=738" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>Gomantong Caves are home to two million bats that drop their faeces all over the ground and even on the handrails. Additionally, there are several million Malaysian cockroaches, hundreds of snakes, scorpions, and freshwater crabs living there. Still want to pay a visit? We doubt you want to.</p>

<h1><strong>4. Hanging Coffins, Philippines</strong></h1>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-06/oeeidmg8_hanging-coffins_625x300_22_June_24.jpeg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>Imagine a place where coffins aren't buried but attached to the sides of cliffs. If you ever visit this location and look up, you will see dead bodies hanging in their customised afterlife homes.</p>

<h2><strong>5. The Door To Hell, Turkmenistan</strong></h2>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-06/oerbe4s_door-to-hell_625x300_22_June_24.jpeg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>The name of this place is enough to send shivers down anyone's spine. Located in the Karakum Desert in Turkmenistan, the "Door to Hell" is a 230-foot-wide crater that simply keeps on burning. The story behind this place dates back to 1971 when Soviet scientists, who were searching for oil, accidentally hit a methane reserve. The drilling platform collapsed, forming the crater and resulting in a dangerous gas release into the air. The scientists then decided to light the crater on fire to burn off the methane. Now, it has been burning continuously for over 50 years.</p>

<p>As the name suggests, you will find an insane number of venomous reptiles on this island. Some reports even suggest that there is an average of one to five snakes per square metre here. The venom of these snakes is said to be five times stronger than their mainland counterparts. That is why the Brazilian government has banned the public from entering this place.</p>

<p>This 86-year-old Singaporean theme park has over 1,000 statues, each as strange as it gets. These statues are so bizarre that you will see a human head on a giant crab, among other peculiarities. The underworld-themed 'Ten Courts of Hell' is considered the main element of Haw Par Villa. To teach young children about morality, the models showcase different types of punishments, such as individuals getting cut in half by a saw for misusing books or people thrown onto a hill of knives for lending money with unreasonably high interest rates.</p>

<p>Dubbed "the most dangerous hike in the world," this location in China is popular for its plank walk - a rickety, 12-inch-wide wooden path attached to the side of a mountain, thousands of feet off the ground. Many visitors hold onto loose metal chains while watching out for broken or missing planks at the same time. Some travellers claim that the hike is worth all the risks due to the beautiful temples and views at the summit.</p>

<p>Want to know about the creepiest accommodation? The Clown Motel in Tonopah, Nevada can give you Halloween vibes at any time of the year. It features brightly coloured doors, a polka-dot facade, and two 19-foot clown cutouts on either side of the building. Inside, you'll find over 3,000 clown figurines. Sounds eerie, right?</p>

<p>Climbing up an active volcano is thrilling enough, but imagine an activity where you have to sit or stand on a piece of plywood and slide your way down the slopes. Every person runs the risk of being burned by lava or breathing in toxins. It must be noted that Cerro Negro has erupted more than 20 times since 1850.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Japan's Emperor Naruhito and Empress Masako arrive in Britain on Saturday ahead of a three-day state visit hosted by King Charles III.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Japan's Emperor Naruhito and Empress Masako arrive in Britain on Saturday ahead of a three-day state visit hosted by King Charles III.</p>

<p>The royal couple are due to touch down on a flight from Japan and spend Sunday and Monday at private engagements before the official programme begins on Tuesday.</p>

<p>The highlight will be a state banquet at Buckingham Palace, with all eyes on a possible appearance by the heir to the throne Prince William's wife Catherine, rarely seen in recent months due to cancer treatment.</p>

<p>Naruhito, 64, will also go to Windsor Castle west of London to lay a wreath on the tomb of Queen Elizabeth II, whose state funeral he and the empress, 60, attended in September 2022.</p>

<p>With Britain in the midst of a general election campaign, it was not immediately clear if there would be any meeting with Prime Minister Rishi Sunak.</p>

<p>Visiting heads of state have typically held talks with the premier and opposition leader, or addressed lawmakers in parliament.</p>

<p>But there are no MPs as parliament has been dissolved before the July 4 vote.</p>

<p>The trip will be the emperor's second official state visit since his accession to the throne in 2019, following a visit to Indonesia last year.</p>

<p>For Charles, 75, it will be the third state visit he has hosted since he ascended to the throne following the death of his mother.</p>

<h3><strong>&nbsp;'Fond memories'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Like Catherine, he was diagnosed with cancer earlier this year but has made a limited return to public duties, and was seen this week with his wife Queen Camilla at the Royal Ascot horse racing meeting.</p>

<p>Catherine, a future queen who is widely known as Kate, is currently undergoing chemotherapy and has stepped back from public life to aid her recovery.</p>

<p>She made a tentative return to public life last week when she attended a military parade in London to mark Charles' official birthday.</p>

<p>Elizabeth, whose 70-year reign began in 1952, hosted two Japanese state visits during her time on the throne: Emperor Hirohito in 1971 and his eldest son Emperor Akihito -- Naruhito's father -- in 1998.</p>

<p>Speaking in Tokyo ahead of the trip, Naruhito said Britain's royals treated him "like family" during his time studying in England in the 1980s.</p>

<p>Naruhito recalled that during his two years at Oxford University, he was invited to Balmoral Castle in Scotland for a few days.</p>

<p>"I have very fond memories of the queen driving a car and inviting me to a barbecue... and Prince Philip showing me around by driving a carriage himself," he told reporters in a rare press conference.</p>

<p>The state visit's programme will also include a Guard of Honour ceremony, a carriage procession at Buckingham Palace, and visits to museums and the Francis Crick Institute, a biomedical research centre in London.</p>

<p>Before leaving on Friday the Japanese emperor and empress will visit Oxford, where they both studied, for private engagements.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A shooter opened fire at an&nbsp;Arkansas&nbsp;supermarket on Friday, killing three civilians and wounding 10 other people, including two police officers,&nbsp;Arkansas&nbsp;State Police said.</p>

<p>The suspect was also wounded in a shootout with police,&nbsp;Arkansas&nbsp;State Police Director Mike Hagar told reporters.</p>

<p>The shooting occurred at the Mad Butcher grocery in Fordyce, a town of 3,200 people about 70 miles (112 km) south of Little Rock.</p>

<p>"Unfortunately, we can confirm that 11 innocent civilians were shot, and three of those are deceased. Two law enforcement officers were injured in the exchange of gunfire. The suspect was also shot and taken into custody," Hagar said. He did not explain the circumstances of the shooting or take questions.</p>

<p>The wounded police officers and the suspect were expected to survive, he said.</p>

<p>Civilian injuries ranged from non-life-threatening to extremely critical, he said.</p>

<p>Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders said on social media platform X that she was briefed on the incident.</p>

<p>"I am thankful to law enforcement and first responders for their quick and heroic action to save lives. My prayers are with the victims and all those impacted by this horrific incident," she said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Almost a year since Yevgeny Prigozhin sent his Wagner mercenaries marching towards Moscow in a rebellion against Russia's military leadership, residents in the capital spoke of respect and admiration for the late renegade.</p>

<p>The mercenary chief died in a mysterious aeroplane crash two months after ordering the short-lived mutiny on June 23-24, 2023.</p>

<p>But despite mounting the biggest-ever challenge to President Vladimir Putin's near quarter of a century in power, Prigozhin and his Wagner Group continue to command respect.</p>

<p>"He did a lot for Russia at a difficult moment," said 60-year-old caretaker Alexander Ulyanov, calling the late mercenary boss a "great man".</p>

<p>Wagner spearheaded some of the Kremlin's longest and bloodiest military campaigns in Ukraine, including the fight for the mostly destroyed city of Bakhmut in the east.</p>

<p>"The organisation he created has an iron discipline," Ulyanov said.</p>

<p>Prigozhin is alive "in our hearts," he added, comparing him to historical generals like Mikhail Kutuzov, who led Russian soldiers during the Napoleonic Wars.</p>

<p>"If people remember him, he's alive," Ulyanov said of Prigozhin.</p>

<p>A former hotdog seller and convicted criminal, Prigozhin became acquainted with Putin in the 1990s, later running catering businesses that served the Kremlin.</p>

<p>Nicknamed "Putin's chef", his influence quickly grew as he won government contracts, eventually founding the Wagner Group in 2014 to support Russian paramilitaries in east Ukraine.</p>

<p>After his death, for which the Kremlin categorically denied responsibility, Putin praised Prigozhin as a "talented businessman" who made "serious mistakes".</p>

<h3><strong>&nbsp;'It was so scary'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>In their quest to unseat Moscow's military top brass, Prigozhin's fighters seized Russia's army headquarters in the southern city of Rostov-on-Don and shot down military aircraft.</p>

<p>They managed to march roughly halfway to the capital Moscow before Belarus mediated a deal to end the near 24-hour uprising.</p>

<p>"It was so scary," said Svetlana, a 42-year-old English teacher who was in Rostov at the time. "I didn't know where it would lead to."</p>

<p>"He was probably right about something. But... the fact that during the special military operation, when hostilities were going on, he deployed and moved some troops to Rostov in particular -- that was wrong," she said.</p>

<p>But "Teddy Boy", a 41-year-old American citizen from Los Angeles and member of the "Espanola" battalion fighting for Russia in Ukraine, praised the mercenary boss.</p>

<p>"I'm not 100 percent with him, but if I had met him, I would have shook his hand," said Teddy Boy, who wore a military uniform and sported tattoos of pro-Russian army symbols.</p>

<p>"He spoke (about) a lot of things that people are thinking, that they're too scared to say. That's the problem. And I think that's why a lot of people supported him."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli forces pounded Rafah in southern Gaza on Friday, as well as other areas across the enclave, killing at least 45 Palestinians as troops engaged in close-quarter combat with Hamas group operatives, residents and Israel's military said.</p>

<p>Residents said the Israelis appeared to be trying to complete their capture of Rafah, which borders Egypt and has been the focus of an Israeli assault since early May.</p>

<p>Tanks were forcing their way into the western and northern parts of the city, having already captured the east, south, and centre.</p>

<p>Firing from planes, tanks, and ships off the coast caused more people to flee the city, which a few months ago was sheltering more than a million displaced people, most of whom have now relocated again.</p>

<p>The Gaza health ministry said at least 25 Palestinians had been killed in Mawasi in western Rafah and 50 wounded. Palestinians said a tank shell hit a tent housing displaced families.</p>

<p>"Two tanks climbed a hilltop overseeing Mawasi and they sent balls of fire that hit the tents of the poor people displaced in the area," one resident told Reuters over a chat app.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said that the incident was under review. "An initial inquiry conducted suggests that there is no indication that a strike was carried out by the IDF (Israel Defence Forces) in the Humanitarian Area in Al-Mawasi," it said.</p>

<p>Earlier, the military said its forces were conducting "precise, intelligence-based" actions in the Rafah area, where troops were involved in close-quarter combat and had located tunnels used by Hamas.</p>

<p>Over the past week, the military said, troops targeted a university that served as a Hamas headquarters from which Hamas operatives fired on soldiers and found weapons and barrel bombs. It did not name the university.</p>

<p>In the central Gaza area of Nusseirat, the military said soldiers killed dozens of operatives over the past week and found a weapons depot containing mortar bombs and military equipment belonging to Hamas.</p>

<p>Some residents said the Israeli onslaught on Rafah had intensified in the previous two days and that the sounds of explosions and gunfire had hardly stopped.</p>

<p>"Last night was one of the worst nights in western Rafah: Drones, planes, tanks, and naval boats bombarded the area. We feel the occupation is trying to complete the control of the city," said Hatem, 45, reached by text message.</p>

<p>"They are taking heavy strikes from the resistance fighters, which may be slowing them down."</p>

<h3><strong>STRIKES ON KHAN YOUNIS AND GAZA CITY</strong></h3>

<p>More than eight months into the war in Gaza, Israel's advance is now focused on the two last areas its forces had yet to seize: Rafah on Gaza's southern edge and the area surrounding Deir al-Balah in the centre.</p>

<p>"The entire city of Rafah is an area of Israeli military operations," Ahmed Al-Sofi, the mayor of Rafah, said in a statement carried by Hamas media on Friday.</p>

<p>"The city is living through a humanitarian catastrophe and people are dying inside their tents because of Israeli bombardment."</p>

<p>Sofi said no medical facility was functioning in the city, and that remaining residents and displaced families lacked the minimum daily needs of food and water.</p>

<p>Palestinian and U.N. figures show that fewer than 100,000 people may have remained in the far western side of the city, which had been sheltering more than half of Gaza's 2.3 million people before the Israeli assault began in early May.</p>

<p>In nearby Khan Younis, an Israeli air strike on Friday killed three people, including a father and son, medics said.</p>

<p>In parallel, Israeli forces continued a new pushback into some Gaza City suburbs in the north of the enclave, where they fought with Hamas-led operatives.</p>

<p>On Friday, an Israeli air strike on a Gaza City municipal facility killed five people, including four municipal workers, the territory's Civil Emergency Service said. Rescue teams were searching the rubble for more missing victims.</p>

<p>In the nearby Beach camp, an Israeli air strike on a house killed at least seven people, medics said.</p>

<p>Palestinian health officials said at least 45 Palestinians were killed in Israeli strikes across Gaza on Friday.</p>

<p>The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said its Gaza office was damaged when heavy-calibre projectiles landed nearby, in an area where hundreds of displaced Palestinians are living in tents.</p>

<p>"This grave security incident is one of several in recent days; previously stray bullets have reached ICRC structures," the organization said in a post on X on Friday. "We decry these incidents that put the lives of humanitarians and civilians at risk."</p>

<p>Israel's ground and air campaign was triggered when Hamas-led operatives barged into southern Israel on Oct. 7, killing around 1,200 people and seizing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.</p>

<p>The offensive has left Gaza in ruins, killed more than 37,400 people, according to Palestinian health authorities, and left nearly the entire population homeless and destitute.</p>

<p>The United Nations said on Friday it is Israel's responsibility - as the occupying power in the Gaza Strip - to restore public order and safety in the Palestinian territory so humanitarian aid can be delivered, amid warnings of imminent famine.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Boeing Starliner's return to Earth from the International Space Station with its first crew of astronauts has been postponed, NASA said on Friday.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Boeing Starliner's return to Earth from the International Space Station with its first crew of astronauts has been postponed, NASA said on Friday.</p>

<p>NASA did not provide a new date, raising questions about when the mission's two astronauts will return as more testing and technical issues have created more delays.</p>

<p>The return to earth was previously scheduled for June 26.</p>

<p>The crew of U.S. astronauts, Butch Wilmore and Sunita Williams, lifted off June 5 as a final demonstration to obtain routine flight certification from NASA.</p>

<p>The crewed test of the spacecraft, which has been test-flown to space twice since 2019 without humans aboard, has encountered five failures of its 28 maneuvering thrusters, five leaks of helium that are meant to pressurize those thrusters, and a slow-moving propellant valve that signaled unfixed issues from the past.</p>

<p>The issues and the additional tests NASA and Boeing have had to do call into question when exactly Starliner will be able to fly its crew home, and add to a list of broader problems Boeing faces with its Starliner program. The company has spent $1.5 billion in cost overruns on top of its $4.5 billion NASA development contract.</p>

<p>NASA wants Starliner to become the second US spacecraft capable of ferrying its astronauts to and from the ISS alongside SpaceX's Crew Dragon, which has been the agency's primary ride since 2020. Boeing's Starliner program has struggled with software glitches, design problems, and subcontractor disputes for years.</p>

<p>When Starliner arrived in the space station's vicinity to dock on June 6, the five thruster failures prohibited the spacecraft from making a close approach until Boeing could implement a fix. The company rewrote software and tweaked some procedures to revive four of them and proceed with docking.</p>

<p>Starliner's undocking and return to Earth represent the spacecraft's most complicated phases of its test mission. NASA officials have said they want to better understand the cause of the thruster failures, valve issue, and helium leaks before Starliner embarks on its roughly six-hour return journey.</p>

<p>While just one thruster remains dead in Starliner's current flight, Boeing encountered four thruster problems during the capsule's uncrewed return from space in 2022.</p>

<p>According to flight rules established jointly by Boeing and NASA, Starliner's maneuvering thrusters must, at a minimum, allow for "6-degrees of freedom of control," and each has one backup thruster, a NASA spokesperson told Reuters.</p>

<p>That could mean at least 12 of the 28 thrusters - most of which are backups - are required for a safe flight, or potentially fewer, as long as the remaining thrusters have one backup and can work together in a way that doesn't restrict Starliner's freedom of movement in space.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A video showing Russian President Vladimir Putin waving goodbye to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un through the window of his private jet has gone viral on social media. The Kremlin leader arrived at Pyongyang's airport early Wednesday. The two leaders spent more than 10 hours together during the one-day visit, as per <em>TASS </em>News agency. From feeding carrots to a horse to taking turns driving each other around in a Russian-built Aurus limousine, both of them were spotted enjoying each other's company. In the end, Putin was also seen waving goodbye to Kim Jong Un from a plane in Pyongyang.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the video, shared on X (formerly Twitter), Vladimir Putin was seen peeping through the airplane window and waving at the North Korean leader. "Putin and Kim Jong Un emotional goodbye," an X user wrote while sharing the clip.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Notably, the Russian President's visit was his first to the country in 24 years. During the visit, they two held wide and one-on-one talks and attended a wreath-laying ceremony at the memorial to soldiers of the Red Army killed in action liberating Korea in World War Two. The two also bonded over animals as Kim fed carrots to a horse while Putin patted it on its head. They also took turns driving each other around in a Russian-built Aurus limousine on Wednesday.</p>

<p>&nbsp;According to reports, Putin had gifted Kim the Russian-built limousine in February this year and has again gifted him the same vehicle. Kim, who is believed to be a keen automobile enthusiast, now has at least two of the vehicles.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In return, the North Korean leader gave the Russian President a pair of Pungsan dogs, a local breed. Kim and Putin were seen looking at the dogs, who were tied to a rose-covered fence, during a segment aired on the state-controlled <em>Korean Central Television</em> on Thursday.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Kim described Putin as "the dearest friend of Korean people" and Putin thanked the host nation and its leadership for their "balanced stance" in regard of "the situation on Ukrainian direction," <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.independent.co.uk/tv/news/putin-north-korea-kim-jong-un-b2566436.html#:~:text=Vladimir%20Putin%20waved%20goodbye%20to,according%20to%20TASS%20news%20agency."><em>The Independent </em></a>reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The leaders of North Korea and Russia also signed an agreement that deepens their military cooperation to include a mutual defence pledge to help each other if attacked, with Kim Jong Un calling the new ties an "alliance".</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Abdullah Hammoud's election two years ago as the first Muslim mayor of Dearborn was a watershed moment for this city, an automaking hub home to the highest concentration of Arab-Americans in the United States.</p>

<p>But while his early focus was on upgrading sewer infrastructure and investing in parks, he has now been thrust into the national spotlight for his outspoken criticism of fellow Democrat President Joe Biden's support for Israel's military offensive in Gaza.</p>

<p>"I'll be the first to say that we don't want to see (Donald) Trump reelected to the White House," Hammoud told AFP in an interview. "But people want to be inspired to come out."</p>

<p>Dearborn, a suburb of Detroit famous as the birthplace of Henry Ford and home of the Ford Motor Company's headquarters, has a population of around 110,000 residents, of whom 55 per cent claim Middle Eastern or North African heritage.</p>

<p>In 2020, Dearborn voters overwhelmingly supported Biden and their ballots could tip the scales in Michigan -- a crucial swing state that may ultimately decide the White House winner in November's election.</p>

<p>Hammoud's profile surged in January after he declined an invitation to meet with Biden campaign officials seeking to shore up the Muslim vote.</p>

<p>Since then, he helped galvanize a movement that saw over 100,000 voters mark "uncommitted" in Michigan's Democratic primary in protest against Biden's policy on Israel and was asked by Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein if he would be her running mate.</p>

<h3><strong>Humble roots&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Hammoud, who won't meet the Constitutional requirement of being 35 until next March, was too young to accept the role, though he said the offer was "very humbling."</p>

<p>Besides, he remains unsure about how he'll cast his ballot.</p>

<p>"I would say that no presidential candidate has earned my vote," said the father-of-two, urging both parties to pay attention to increasing public disapproval of Israel's actions.</p>

<p>"If you look at all the polling data that's emerging across the country, from coast to coast, the issues that we have been advocating for, fighting for... are issues that have popular support."</p>

<p>These demands include a permanent ceasefire as the pathway to provide safe harbour for all hostages and prisoners, unfettered access to humanitarian aid, and ending the supply of weapons to Israel.</p>

<p>The son of Lebanese immigrants, Hammoud grew up in a "working poor" blue-collar family. His father drove a truck while his mother's father worked on an auto factory assembly line.</p>

<p>He was drawn towards the Democratic Party for its support of the labor movement, and equally repelled by Republicans, whom he says have a history of "demonizing Arab Americans, Muslim Americans and other people of color."</p>

<p>Hammoud's first dream was to become a physician but wasn't able to get the grades. He instead trained as an epidemiologist and began climbing the corporate ladder as a healthcare executive.</p>

<p>But the sudden death of his beloved elder brother -- Hammoud was the second of five children -- made him re-evaluate his priorities, and in 2016 he won election to the state legislature.</p>

<h3><strong>'What will Biden do?'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Then in 2022, he became the second in a trio of new Muslim mayors in the southeast Michigan cities of Dearborn, Dearborn Heights and Hamtramck.</p>

<p>Hammoud immediately set to work righting historical wrongs.</p>

<p>For decades, the city had been marred by a reputation for racism, exemplified by the openly segregationist policies of former mayor Orville Hubbard.</p>

<p>Hammoud appointed the city's first Arab-American police chief, which led to a drastic drop in tickets issued to Black drivers within a year, according to his spokesman.</p>

<p>Until the war in Gaza, triggered by Hamas's attacks and hostage-taking on October 7, 2023, Hammoud considered Biden a "transformative" president, but now believes "the genocide outweighs the impact of that domestic policy."</p>

<p>Hammoud sidesteps the question of whether he could ultimately endorse Biden under the right circumstances, emphasizing that whatever he might say, it's too late for some of his constituents who have lost dozens of relatives to Israeli bombs.</p>

<p>He has no doubt that Trump, who imposed a Muslim travel ban during his tenure, would be an utter disaster -- citing the Republican's arming of Saudi Arabia against Yemen, the backing of Israeli settlements in the West Bank, and shifting the US embassy to Jerusalem.</p>

<p>But Hammoud rails against fellow Democrats who have directed frustration at members of his community for potentially paving the way for Trump's return by withholding their support for Biden.</p>

<p>Asked how he would respond to this criticism, Hammoud said: "The question should be asked of President Joe Biden -- what will he do to prevent Trump being reelected come this November? What will he do to help prevent the unravelling of American democracy and the fabric of our society?"</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US Department of Justice is considering a deal with Boeing that would avoid criminal prosecution of the aerospace giant but may appoint a federal supervisor to oversee company progress on safety improvements, The New York Times reported Friday.</p>

<p>People familiar with the discussions told the daily that the terms of the possible alternative settlement, known as a deferred prosecution agreement, or DPA, are still subject to change.</p>

<p>A DOJ official involved in the case, Glenn Leon, chief of the fraud section criminal division, said in an email to a civil party lawyer seen by AFP that the department "has not made a decision" on the path it will take with respect to Boeing.</p>

<p>The DOJ is determining its next steps after concluding in May that Boeing could be prosecuted for violating a criminal settlement following two fatal 737 MAX crashes in 2018 and 2019 which claimed 346 lives.</p>

<p>But the Times, citing sources familiar with the discussions, reported that after substantial internal debate, Justice officials "appear to have concluded that prosecuting Boeing would be too legally risky."</p>

<p>Officials also reportedly believe that the appointment of a watchdog would be "a quicker, more efficient way" to ensure safety and quality control improvements are made, the newspaper said.</p>

<p>Last month, the DOJ told the judge in the case it would give its decision no later than July 7.</p>

<p>The DOJ's Leon emailed Paul Cassell, a lawyer for families in the criminal case against Boeing, saying the Times reporting "was simply not correct."</p>

<p>Boeing did not respond to AFP requests for reaction.</p>

<p><strong>- No decision -</strong></p>

<p>The troubled planemaker had contested the department's conclusions in mid-June, but has recognized the gravity of the safety crisis and CEO Dave Calhoun told Congress that Boeing is "taking action and making progress."</p>

<p>In January 2021, Justice announced an initial DPA in which Boeing agreed to pay $2.5 billion to settle fraud charges over certification of the 737 MAX.</p>

<p>But since early 2023, the manufacturer has experienced multiple production and quality control problems on its commercial aircraft, as well as mid-flight incidents including in January when a door plug panel flew off an Alaska Airlines 737 Max 9.</p>

<p>The DOJ says Boeing's violation of several provisions of the initial agreement, including measures requiring it to bolster its internal controls to detect and deter fraud, opened the company to prosecution.</p>

<p>Victims' families have called for the criminal prosecution of Boeing and its executives, and are seeking a nearly $25 billion fine.</p>

<p>A new DPA would allow the US government to resolve Boeing's violations without a trial.</p>

<p>That could serve as a victory of sorts for Boeing, a company seen as critical to the US aviation industry as well as national security.</p>

<p>Cassell, the families' lawyer, warned against sealing an agreement avoiding trial.</p>

<p>"We hope that the Department is not using its claim to have not yet made a 'final decision' as a ploy to gain additional time to hammer out a DPA deal with Boeing," Cassell said in a statement.</p>

<p>"The first DPA deal failed. There is no reason to think a second one would be any better," he said, adding it's time for "moving forward with a trial and obtaining a guilty verdict against Boeing."</p>

<p>Such lawsuits in the past have forced companies into filing for bankruptcy, the Times reported, and a conviction could potentially prevent Boeing from receiving government contracts.</p>

<p>Boeing's defense, space and security segment generated $25 billion in 2023, nearly a third of the company's sales.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A state jury has found David DePape guilty on all charges related to his home invasion and hammer attack on former US House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi's husband, Paul Pelosi, CBS News reported.</p>

<p>DePape was found guilty of the five counts he faced in the stand trial, including aggravated kidnapping resulting in bodily harm or death, false imprisonment of an elder or dependent adult, threatening the family of public officials, first-degree residential burglary, and preventing or dissuading a witness by force or threat.</p>

<p>According to court officials, the jury reached a unanimous decision on all five counts. The jury started its deliberations in San Francisco on Tuesday afternoon.</p>

<p>Court officials announced that the verdict had been reached on Friday afternoon and would be announced shortly after 4 pm (local time). There was no court on Wednesday due to the Juneteenth holiday.</p>

<p>In his closing arguments, San Francisco Public Defender Adam Lipson said DePape had been living a solitary life and had gone "down the rabbit hole of propaganda and conspiracy theories" when he broke into Nancy Pelosi's residence on October 28, 2022, CBS News reported.</p>

<p>Nancy Pelosi's spokesperson, Aaron Bennett, stated on behalf of the Pelosi family. Bennett said, "Speaker Pelosi and her family remain in awe of their Pop's bravery, which shone through again on the witness stand in this trial just as it did when he saved his own life on the night of the attack."</p>

<p>"For nearly 20 gruelling months, Mr Pelosi has demonstrated extraordinary courage and fortitude every day of his recovery. The Pelosi family is grateful for the kind thoughts and prayers they continue to receive. Speaker Pelosi and her family will refrain from further substantive comment until sentencing is complete," he added.</p>

<p>David DePape was sentenced to 30 years in federal prison in May after a jury in November 2023 found him guilty of trying to hold then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi hostage and assaulting her husband at their residence in San Francisco, CBS News reported.</p>

<p>The attack on Paul Pelosi was captured on police bodycam video after officers responded to his 911 call and found him struggling with DePape, who then bludgeoned Pelosi with a hammer.</p>

<p>The incident happened just before the 2022 midterm elections, sending shockwaves through the political world, and was attributed to the predictable impacts of rising demonizing political rhetoric.</p>

<p>The opening statements in the state trial started in May, a day after DePape's federal sentencing was reopened to permit him to speak after a procedural error during his original sentencing, CBS News reported.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, the judge in the state trial permitted a defence motion to dismiss three counts in the case against DePape, which included attempted murder, assault of an elder, and assault with a deadly weapon -- based on the public defender's argument that the counts fell under double jeopardy.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>South Korea said on Tuesday it will issue a ban on its citizens travelling to the border areas of Israel and Lebanon after advising them to leave the countries amid escalating tensions in the Middle East.</p>

<p>The foreign ministry said the ban will start from Wednesday in areas near the Blue Line, referring to a demarcation line between Lebanon and Israel where parts of the international border are disputed.</p>

<p>The ministry also "strongly advised" its nationals in Lebanon and Israel to leave the countries as soon as possible.</p>

<p>A temporary advisory urging against travel to Iran was also set to be issued, the ministry said in a statement.</p>

<p>The travel advisory was issued after a commander of the Iran-aligned Lebanese group Hezbollah and the head of the political wing of Hamas, the group that runs the Gaza Strip, were killed, Lee Jae-woong, a ministry spokesperson said.</p>

<p>The assassinations came after a deadly rocket attack in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights late last month.</p>

<p>"South Korea's government...hopes that diplomatic efforts to de-escalate tensions such as negotiations for a ceasefire and hostage release will not stop," Lee told a briefing.</p>

<p>Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh was killed in the Iranian capital Tehran last week, an attack that drew threats of revenge on Israel and fueled further concern that the conflict in Gaza was turning into a wider Middle East war.Washington has been urging other countries through diplomatic channels to tell Iran that escalation in the Middle East is not in their interest, a State Department spokesperson said on Monday.</p>

<p>More than 500 South Korean nationals are currently residing in Israel and around 120 in Lebanon, the ministry said. It warned that South Koreans travelling to the border areas could be subject to punishment under the passport law.</p>

<p>As of last summer at least four South Koreans had been convicted of violating a ban on travelling to Ukraine without permission, according to media reports.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The company claims that the body can be willingly revived in the future and cause of death treated.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Death is inevitable, still many people across the world are busy finding ways to become immortal. Like 46-year-old Bryan Johnson, the CEO of a Silicon Valley company, who claims to have reversed his biological age by more than five years through an anti-ageing regimen. Taking it a step further, a start-up in Germany is offering to freeze people in cryopreservation and be revived when technology is advanced enough. According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://in.mashable.com/science/79875/freeze-your-dead-body-at-rs18-crore-and-revive-it-in-the-future-german-startup-says-its-possible"><em>Mashable</em></a>, Tomorrow Bio is demanding Rs 1.8 crore to preserve the entire body after death and Rs 67.2 lakh if someone just wants their brain to be frozen.</p>

<p>Through cryopreservation, where temperature is minus 198 degrees Celsius, the company puts a body in 'biostasis' - a state where all biological processes are ceased indefinitely.</p>

<p>The company claims that the body can be willingly revived in the future and cause of death treated.</p>

<p>Tomorrow Bio said on its website that the company's vision is "to build a world where people can choose how long they want to live -Independent of where they are, who they are, and their financial resources".</p>

<p><em>Mashable</em> said that six people and five pets have already been put under cryopreservation, and more than 650 people who have paid for the service are waiting in line.</p>

<p>Company's co-founder Fernando Azevedo Pinheir said during his lifetime, "we may witness the safe cryopreservation and reanimation of complex organisms".</p>

<p>Mr Pinheir also said that his company starts the work as soon as a person dies. He explained that specially made ambulances available in different European cities carry the bodies to the main facility in Switzerland. The company has standby teams in Berline, Amsterdam and Zurich for the job.</p>

<p>The body is then kept in an isolated steel container filled with liquid nitrogen for 10 days to achieve the temperature of minus 198 degrees Celsius.</p>

<h3><strong>What is cryopreservation?</strong></h3>

<p>It is a process where biological material - cells, tissues, or organs - are frozen to preserve the material for an extended period of time.</p>

<p>However, cryopreservation is different from freezing. It involves a special cryoprotectant solutions (liquid nitrogen) to prevent ice crystals on the body, which can be detrimental for it.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian declared Microsoft "the most fragile" platform after a massive IT outage last month caused chaos across the world. The outage, lasting five days, is estimated to have cost Delta $500 million in lost revenue, compensation and hotel expenses.</p>

<p>Mr Bastian's comments came in response to questions about the airline's ongoing relationship with Microsoft. In a CNBC interview, the Delta CEO said "Microsoft is probably the most fragile platform" and pointedly asked, "When was the last time you heard of a big outage at Apple?"&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mr Bastian spoke of the high valuations of big tech companies, fueled in part by the hype surrounding generative AI, and argued that these companies have a responsibility to ensure the stability of their current systems. "They are building the future, and they have to make sure they fortify the current," he said.</p>

<p>The outage, which affected Delta's website, mobile app, and check-in systems, resulted in thousands of refunds and reimbursement requests. While the exact number was not disclosed, a Delta spokesman confirmed it was in the "thousands." The outage, caused by a botched CrowdStrike software update, took thousands of Microsoft systems offline and required 40,000 servers to be manually reset. Delta's crew scheduling platforms were also affected, leading to further disruptions, the CEO said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"If you're going to be having access, priority access to the Delta ecosystem in terms of technology, you've got to test the stuff. You can't come into a mission-critical 24/7 operation and tell us we have a bug," Mr Bastian said.</p>

<p>CrowdStrike, the cybersecurity firm responsible for the problematic update, has yet to offer any financial assistance to Delta. The company has only provided free consulting advice on managing the fallout.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In response to the incident, Delta has hired attorney David Boies to seek compensation from both CrowdStrike and Microsoft. Mr Bastian said they needed to protect "shareholders, customers and employees" from the financial and "reputational damage" caused by the outage.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The government is in close touch with the nearly 19,000 Indian nationals - almost half of whom are students - in Bangladesh, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar told Parliament Tuesday afternoon.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="http://www.ndtv.com/topic/sheikh-hasina" target="_blank">Sheikh Hasina</a> requested permission "at very short notice" to come to India following her forced resignation as Bangladesh Prime Minister, External Affairs Minister <a class="sp_lnk2" href="http://www.ndtv.com/topic/s-jaishankar" target="_blank">S Jaishankar</a> said Tuesday.</p>

<p>Briefing Parliament on the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/bangladesh-unrest-live-updates-pm-sheikh-hasina-bangladesh-violence-bangladesh-violence-live-6267300" target="_blank">Bangladesh situation</a>, India's response, and the status of an estimated 19,000 Indian nationals in that country, Mr Jaishankar said the government is in "close and continuous touch" with the diaspora and called on the host nation to provide required security.</p>

<p>Mr Jaishankar, who briefed leaders at an all-party meet this morning and <a class="sp_lnk2" href="http://www.ndtv.com/topic/pm-modi" target="_blank">Prime Minister Narendra Modi</a> last night, said he sought "the understanding and support of the House" on this issue.</p>

<p>"On August 5 demonstrators converged in Dhaka despite a curfew. Our understanding is that after a meeting with leaders of the security establishment Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina made the decision to resign. At very short notice she requested approval to come, for the moment, to India. We simultaneously received a request for flight clearance... she arrived in Delhi yesterday evening."</p>

<p>READ |&nbsp;</p>

<p>He also referred to an address by Bangladesh Army chief General Waker-uz-Zaman - made Monday evening, shortly after Mrs Hasina stepped down - in which he said, "I have met opposition leaders... we have decided to form an interim government..." and appealed for the violent protests to end.</p>

<p>"The situation in Bangladesh is still evolving. We are in close and continuous touch with the Indian community in Bangladesh through our diplomatic missions. There are an estimated 19,000 Indian nationals of which about 9,000 are students. The bulk of students returned in July..." he said.</p>

<p>"In the last 24 hours we have also been in regular touch with authorities in Dhaka. I seek the understanding and support of the House in regard to sensitive issues regarding an important neighbour on which there has always been strong national consensus," he said.</p>

<p>Mr Jaishankar also spoke about India's diplomatic missions in Chittagong, Rajshahi, Khulna and Sylhet, and said, "It is our expectation the host government will provide required security..."</p>

<p>On the question of minorities in that country (over 90 per cent of the Bangladeshi population are Muslims), the External Affairs Minister said, "We are monitoring the situation with regard to minorities. There are reports of initiatives to ensure their protection and well-being. We welcome that... but will naturally remain deeply concerned till law and order is visibly restored."</p>

<p>India's northeast states share a 4,096-km border with Bangladesh. Infiltration concerns prompted a 12-hour night curfew in Meghalaya, as well as putting Border Security Forces on high alert.</p>

<p>Mrs Hasina, 76, is in an undisclosed location in India after fleeing Dhaka - shortly before protesters overran and looted her residence. She has reportedly applied for asylum in the United Kingdom.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, the pioneer of the global microcredit movement who could shepherd Bangladesh's new interim government, was an arch foe of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina who has resigned and fled the country.</p>

<p>Known as the "banker to the poor", Mr Yunus and the Grameen Bank he founded won the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize for helping lift millions from poverty by providing tiny loans of sums less than $100 to the rural poor who are too impoverished to gain attention from traditional banks.</p>

<p>Their lending model has since inspired similar projects around the world, including developed countries like the United States where Mr Yunus started a separate non-profit Grameen America.</p>

<p>As his success grew, Mr Yunus, now 84, flirted briefly with a political career, attempting to form his own party in 2007. But his ambitions were widely viewed as having sparked the ire of Hasina, who accused him of "sucking blood from the poor".</p>

<p>Critics in Bangladesh and other countries, including neighbouring India, have also said microlenders charge excessive rates and make money out of the poor. But Mr Yunus said the rates were far lower than local interest rates in developing countries or the 300% or more that loan sharks sometimes demand.</p>

<p>In 2011, Ms Hasina's government removed him as head of Grameen Bank, saying that at 73, he had stayed on past the legal retirement age of 60. Thousands of Bangladeshis formed a human chain to protest his sacking.</p>

<p>In January this year, Mr Yunus was sentenced to six months in prison for violations of labour law. He and 13 others were also indicted by a Bangladesh court in June on charges of embezzlement of 252.2 million taka ($2 million) from the workers' welfare fund of a telecoms company he founded.</p>

<p>Although he was not jailed in either case, Mr Yunus faces more than 100 other cases on graft and other charges. Mr Yunus denies any involvement and said, during an interview with Reuters, the accusations were "very flimsy, made-up stories".</p>

<p>"Bangladesh doesn't have any politics left," Mr Yunus said in June, criticising Ms Hasina. "There's only one party which is active and occupies everything, does everything, gets to the elections in their way."</p>

<p>He told Indian broadcaster Times Now that Monday marked the "second liberation day" for Bangladesh after its 1971 war of independence from Pakistan following the exit of Ms Hasina.</p>

<p>Mr Yunus is currently in Paris undergoing a minor medical procedure, his spokesperson said, adding he has agreed to the request of students who led the campaign against Mr Hasina to be the chief adviser of the interim government.</p>

<p>Mr Yunus was an economist teaching at the University of Chittagong when famine struck Bangladesh in 1974, killing hundreds of thousands of people and leaving him searching for better ways to help his country's vast rural population.</p>

<p>That opportunity came when Mr Yunus came across a woman in a village near he university who had borrowed from a moneylender. The amount was less than a dollar but in return the moneylender gained the exclusive right to buy everything she produced at a price to be determined by the moneylender.</p>

<p>"This to me was a way of recruiting slave labour," Mr Yunus said in his Nobel acceptance speech. He found 42 people who had borrowed a combined $27 from the moneylender and lent them the funds himself - the success of that endeavour spurring him on to do more and think of credit as a basic human right.</p>

<p>"When I gave the loans I was astounded by the results I got. The poor paid the loans on time every time."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>As of August 5, over&nbsp;300 people&nbsp;had been killed and hundreds injured. As an angry mob marched into Dhaka on the same day, the army “took responsibility” of the country, and Hasina resigned.</p>

She had also brought continuity and certainty to the country's external conduct, especially with the “Friendship to all, malice to none” foreign policy, which had been key in attracting investments and infrastructure from the West, India, Russia, China, and Japan alike.</p>

<p>A crucial aspect of her successful foreign policy had been winning India's trust and improving economic ties. Hasina respected India's three red lines, which the previous BNP and JI governments violated on multiple occasions. This included protecting Hindu minorities, clamping down on extremists and Northeast militants who targeted India from Bangladesh, and respecting Indian security sensitivities and concerns when engaging with hostile countries like Pakistan and China.</p>

<p>Under these robust ties, the trade between both countries grew from $2 billion in 2007 to $14 billion in 2022, and as of the following year, New Delhi had even offered Dhaka<a data-auth="Verified" data-linkindex="9" href="https://apc01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.orfonline.org%2Fpublic%2Fuploads%2Fposts%2Fpdf%2F20240430110935.pdf&amp;data=05%7C02%7CHarshitaM%40ndtv.com%7C698647550f2646fff63008dcb5e77ed5%7C89e0013190cd478790cc5ded788d77de%7C0%7C0%7C638585256415593626%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=gOJ5uSmWYMN6jiqwTSbUOqTvARs%2FCnvvax1wbf%2FG8dQ%3D&amp;reserved=0" id="x_m_-7131637826883888488m_-1349298423950993725m_8122995676327292520m_3842840075032334920OWAa4232a63-f3ed-7711-e4cb-94d901e2c4a1" originalsrc="https://www.orfonline.org/public/uploads/posts/pdf/20240430110935.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" shash="ls4HblN4XtFRj5Ww1uyudBY4iKm9HMb02zi6oyYACRkThJK1c3BDgd3B+95xfh6JmkQLlSwC3lbDjCDLkniiz+FprvDTx8M4Dmk+rn60CUycxTgyKUzwg+1VaXcH8j1xTPwfThycF7tCNFO0RCtV8nFxu+U/TAC0ZfpXyURBPMA=" target="_blank" title="Original URL: https://www.orfonline.org/public/uploads/posts/pdf/20240430110935.pdf.

<p>Connectivity took precedence too with the reopening of rail lines, a push for transit and port access, and the construction of a diesel supply pipeline. Both countries also resolved their maritime disputes and ratified the land boundary pact, ushering in the “golden era of India-Bangladesh relations”.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>India's Quest for Connectivity&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p>Notably, New Delhi's trust for Hasina incentivised India to promote regional integration and connectivity through its own territory, something Dhaka had long been calling for. This was done for two reasons: one, it would help India's neighbours to boost their economies by fostering economic cooperation with each other, and two, it would help Delhi deter increasing Chinese presence and investments in these countries.</p>

<p>Dhaka's stability and economic growth also made it an attractive market for South Asian countries like Nepal and Bhutan, both of which possess great energy potential, even as they have scant foreign reserves and are landlocked and over-dependent on India. Bangladesh has looked up to these countries for importing energy, exporting its products, and further fuelling its economic growth.</p>

In June, New Delhi and Dhaka also signed an MoU that enabled Bangladesh railways to reach Nepal and Bhutan using Indian railway lines. Bangladesh itself permitted Bhutan to&nbsp;build&nbsp;a special economic zone in its territory, which would be crucial to the latter's Gelephu Special Administrative Region project when linked through India.&nbsp;</p>

<p>India, meanwhile, had recently agreed to facilitate electricity trade from Nepal and Bhutan to Bangladesh through Indian energy grids and transmission lines.&nbsp;</p>

Soon after Hasina's resignation, they targeted the country's Hindu minority community and Awami League supporters. These developments not only underscore the opposition's lack of concern for Delhi's sensitivities but also point to the grim possibility of an exodus and of a revival of Delhi's scepticism for Bangladesh. The Indian National Security Advisor's meeting with Hasina after she fled to India demonstrates Delhi's security concerns about the ongoing developments.</p>

<h2><strong>Growing Mistrust</strong></h2>

<p>Second, the students and protesters opposing Hasina have often accused India of supporting her regime. To what extent this rhetoric and narrative will grow depends on India's response to the ongoing developments.

With an angry populace involved in arsoning and violence throughout the country today, some have even expressed concern and dissatisfaction about a military administration. If this anger and disenchantment persist, it will lead to political and economic instability, impacting Bangladesh's economy, investments, and connectivity efforts. This could also have spillover implications for India.</p>

However, the fact that the latest such consultations on August 5 included student organisations and members of the JI, the HI, and the BNP but excluded the Awami League is not very reassuring for Delhi. The release of BNP supremo and Hasina's arch-rival Khaleda Zia, within hours of the former's ouster<b>,</b>&nbsp;raises similar concerns on the direction, composition, and intention of a potential interim government.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>A Jolt For Delhi</strong></h2>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/sheikh-hasinas-15-year-reign-ends-impact-on-india-bangladesh-ties-6269822">Hasina's resignation is possibly one of the biggest strategic shocks</a> for New Delhi in recent years. Her government's economic and foreign policy fostered a strong bond with India and made it a hub of regional connectivity and integration. With her ouster, all of this is at risk today. This is not to say that it would be entirely impossible for Delhi to find a way to work with a new regime, but any such initiative would be difficult given that it will require building trust and respecting each other's redlines — not an easy task given the history and politics of the two countries.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Until then, any good news from Dhaka will mostly elude Delhi and its neighbours.&nbsp;</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Amit Mehta, an Indian-origin US judge, has handed Google a legal blow, ruling that the tech giant used exclusive agreements to make itself the “default” search engine and ad provider on devices, giving it a major advantage over its rivals. The trial revealed that Google paid billions to companies like Apple to remain the default search engine on their devices.</p>

<p><strong>Who is District Court Judge Amit Mehta?</strong></p>

<p>1. Born in Patan, Gujarat, Amit Mehta moved to the United States with his parents at the age of one. Mr Mehta earned his BA degree in Political Science and Economics from Georgetown University in 1993 and later graduated with a J.D. from the University of Virginia School of Law in 1997.</p>

<p>2. After law school, Mr Mehta worked at the San Francisco office of Latham &amp; Watkins LLP. He also clerked for the Honourable Susan P. Graber of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Mr Mehta joined Zuckerman Spaeder LLP in Washington, DC in 1999, where he worked until 2002. He then joined the District of Columbia Public Defender Service as a staff attorney from 2002 to 2007. In 2007, he returned to Zuckerman Spaeder, focusing on white-collar criminal defence, complex business disputes, and appellate advocacy.</p>

<p>3. During his time at Zuckerman Spaeder, Mr Mehta served on the Board of Directors of the Mid-Atlantic Innocence Project and co-chaired the District of Columbia Bar's Criminal Law and Individual Rights Section Steering Committee. He was also a Director of Facilitating Leadership in Youth, a non-profit organisation dedicated to after-school activities and mentoring for at-risk youth.</p>

<p>4. On December 22, 2014, he was appointed to the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, making him a federal judge. He was appointed by former US President Barack Obama.&nbsp;</p>

<p>5. Amit Mehta has represented high-profile clients, including former US Representative Tom Feeney and Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the former president of the IMF. Mr Mehta helped Mr Strauss-Kahn defeat criminal assault charges in a New York court. As a judge, Mr Mehta has made significant rulings, including cases related to the January 6 Capitol riots. He denied former President Donald Trump's attempt to dismiss civil lawsuits holding him accountable for inciting the riot. Mr Mehta wrote that his decision was "consistent with the purposes behind such immunity", despite the gravity of holding a President accountable.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>British immigration rules do not allow individuals to travel to that country to seek asylum or temporary refuge, the UK Home Office told NDTV Tuesday morning, amid persistent speculation ousted Bangladesh leader <a class="sp_lnk2" href="http://www.ndtv.com/topic/sheikh-hasina" target="_blank">Sheikh Hasina</a>, now in Delhi, will fly to London to claim sanctuary.</p>

<p>The UK government - now headed by Sir Keir Starmer following Labour's landslide win last month - also said individuals seeking asylum must do so "in the first safe country they reach".</p>

<p>"The UK has a proud record of providing protection for people who need it. However, there is no provision for someone to be allowed to travel to the UK to seek asylum or temporary refuge."</p>

<p>"Those who need international protection should claim asylum in the first safe country they reach - that is the fastest route to safety," a UK Home Office spokesperson told NDTV.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, sources indicate a formal asylum request is being processed.</p>

<p>Mrs Hasina, 76, was forced to resign as Prime Minister Monday evening after <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/bangladesh-unrest-live-updates-pm-sheikh-hasina-bangladesh-violence-bangladesh-violence-live-6267300" target="_blank">weeks-long protests over a jobs quota killed over 300 people</a>. She fled Dhaka in a military aircraft - reportedly after the Bangladesh Army gave her a 45-minute ultimatum - and flew first to an IAF base in Uttar Pradesh.</p>

<p>Sources last night told NDTV Mrs Hasina - met on arrival in India by National Security Advisor Ajit Doval - would proceed on to London after her plane was refuelled. Since then, though, there has been confirmation of the former Prime Minister's schedule or, indeed, about her location.</p>

<p>Sources have, though, said she is in "protective custody" of Indian intelligence services.</p>

<p>She is accompanied by her younger sister, Sheikh Rehana, who is a UK citizen, which could be useful to claim asylum in that country. Also, her niece, Tulip Siddiq, is a British Labour parliamentarian.</p>

<p>Mrs Hasina's daughter, Saima Wazed, is based in Delhi as the regional chief for the World Health Organization. This, though, may not open doors as she works for an international agency.</p>

<h3><strong>Indian Government's Position</strong></h3>

<p>This morning Bangladeshi publication <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.daily-sun.com/post/760680" target="_blank">Daily Sun</a> cited unconfirmed sources as saying India has granted permission for an "interim stay", during which Mrs Hasina will get comprehensive logistical support.</p>

<p>This is reportedly only temporary and pending relocation to Britain.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been briefed on the Bangladesh situation, and External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar has spoken to leaders of all major political parties in the country.</p>

What Sources Said</a></p>

<p>At that meeting Mr Jaishankar spoke of a "conspiracy" to topple Mrs Hasina's government. This was in response to a question by Congress MP Rahul Gandhi,&nbsp;who asked if there could be an involvement of foreign powers, specifically Pakistan, in the dramatic developments in Dhaka over the past few weeks.</p>

<p>The events in Bangladesh present a problem for India, particularly if the UK turns down Sheikh Hasina's asylum request. India also does not want to be seen as overtly backing the ousted leader because that may complicate the country's relationship with the new government in Bangladesh, whatever it may be.</p>

<h3><strong>What Next For Bangladesh?</strong></h3>

<p>A new "interim government" - to be advised, most likely, by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus - is believed to be taking shape in the crisis-hit country. This follows the release from jail - ordered by President&nbsp;Mohammed Shahabuddin - of former PM Khaleda Zia, who was convicted of corruption.</p>

<p>In speculation that has emerged (inevitably so) since Mrs Hasina quit, three key names are at the forefront, two of whom are the Army, which took charge after Mrs Hasina quit, and which may have given her a 45-minute ultimatum; and her nemesis and former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, who was jailed in 2018 on corruption charges and whose release was ordered by the President.</p>

<p>The painting is believed to be a part of Sheldon's portrait series of monarchs, queens, and other significant historical individuals. The artwork is thought to be one of the 22 portraits a local politician and tapestry manufacturer commissioned in the 1590s. The original location of these paintings was Sheldon's Warwickshire residence, Weston House, in the Long Gallery.<br />
<br />
In a <a href="https://adamfineart.wordpress.com/2024/07/04/ralph-sheldons-portrait-of-henry-viii-reidentified/">blog post </a>shared last month, Mr Busiakiewicz pointed out the unusual arched top and parallels with other Sheldon commission portraits still in existence. He wrote, "Seeing this round-topped portrait immediately reminded me of a famous set of likenesses commissioned by the local politician and tapestry maker Ralph Sheldon (c. 1537–1613) for his home Weston House, Warwickshire, during the 1590s."</p>

<p>"Consisting of twenty-two portraits, mostly images of Kings, Queens and significant contemporary international figures, only a handful are known today.1 They are notable for each having arched tops, as they were once incorporated into an architectural frieze of the Long Gallery at Weston," he added.</p>

<p>Following his visit to Warwick Shire Hall, Mr Busiakiewicz detailed the proof and identified the portrait in a follow-up blog post. He wrote that the portrait was large, and completely in line with the other Sheldon portraits (measuring approximately 84 cm tall), much more imposing than other bust-length Elizabethan corridor portraits of the period. "Henry VIII's face commands a particularly strong presence in the composition, and its considerable size is suggestive perhaps that a cartoon from the Holbein mural (like the Petworth painting) is likely to have been used in its creation," he further said.</p>

<p>The portrait was credited to an artist working in the style of Hans Holbein the Younger when it was purchased by the Warwickshire County Council in 1951 from Madingley Hall, now a part of the University of Cambridge, mentioned Adam Busiakiewicz in his blog. It is uncertain where the picture was between 1908 and 1951 as well as its entire origin.</p>

<p>As per the New York Post, the portrait has been relocated to the Council's Museum Collections Center in anticipation of finding additional information about the artwork.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The man reportedly left his wife to live with his mistress while they were still married.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Chinese woman's decision to remove her husband's life support after his infidelity has sparked a heated online debate. According to the <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scmp.com/news/people-culture/trending-china/article/3273212/china-wife-disconnects-life-support-dying-husband-who-cheated-her">South China Morning Post</a></em>, the 38-year-old man from Liaoning province in northeastern China recently suffered a severe cerebral haemorrhage at his mistress' home. The man reportedly left his wife to live with his mistress while they were still married.</p>

<p>After the man was admitted to the ICU, medical staff attempted to locate his wife to obtain consent for surgery. However, she was nowhere to be found. Shortly after, a second woman arrived at the hospital, identifying herself as the patient's wife. Dr. Chen briefed her on the critical situation, explaining that the patient was in a coma with a slim chance of survival, even with surgical intervention.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the patient's life was being temporarily sustained by medical equipment, and the cost of surgery was extremely high.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The wife revealed that her husband had been unfaithful to her for over a decade, showed no emotional support, and provided no financial assistance. She had lost her emotional attachment to him long ago. She refused to sign the consent form and asked doctors to remove her husband's life-supporting tracheal tube.</p>

<p>Notably, Chinese law requires doctors to inform a patient's family about surgical risks and obtain written consent when the patient is unable to decide. If the family disagrees with treatment, the hospital's head can authorise necessary measures without consensus.</p>

<p>The wife's shocking move has raised questions about the complexities of love and betrayal. Reacting to the incident, one social media user wrote, ''This unfaithful man is in critical condition and the surgery is unlikely to save him. This is his karma.'' Another said, ''She is heartless. No matter what, giving up treatment is giving up a life.''</p>

<p>A third commented, ''Your wife will accompany you until old age. Treating your wife well is treating yourself well.''</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Bangladesh Protest: A new "interim government" - to be advised, most likely, by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus - is taking shape in crisis-hit Bangladesh following Sheikh Hasina resigning as Prime Minister.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A new "interim government" - to be advised, most likely, by Nobel laureate <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/topic/muhammad-yunus" target="_blank">Muhammad Yunus</a> - is taking shape in crisis-hit <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/topic/bangladesh" target="_blank">Bangladesh</a> following <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/topic/sheikh-hasina" target="_blank">Sheikh Hasina</a> resigning as Prime Minister.</p>

<p>Bangladesh President Mohammed Shahabuddin gave his assent late Monday for that temporary administration. A meeting was held at his residence that was attended by the chiefs of the country's Army, Navy, and Air Force, as well as political party leaders and civil society members.</p>

<p>In speculation that has emerged (inevitably so) since Mrs Hasina quit, three key names are at the forefront, two of whom are the Army, which took charge after Mrs Hasina quit, and which may have given her a 45-minute ultimatum; and her nemesis and former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, who was jailed in 2018 on corruption charges and whose release was ordered by the President.</p>

<h3><strong>Who Is Khaleda Zia</strong></h3>

<p>In 1991 Mrs Zia, now 78 and unwell, became Bangladesh's first woman Prime Minister.</p>

<p>She won a second term in 1996 but the elections were boycotted and denounced as unfair by the major opposition parties, including Sheikh Hasina's Awami League. Her second term lasted 12 days; a caretaker government was installed and fresh elections were held, which Mrs Hasina won.</p>

<p>Mrs Zia returned to power five years later.</p>

<p><strong>READ |&nbsp;</strong><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/who-is-khaleda-zia-jailed-bangladesh-ex-pm-set-to-be-released-amid-turmoil-6273897" target="_blank">Who Is Khaleda Zia, Jailed Ex-PM To Be Freed Amid Turmoil</a></p>

<p>In 2007 she was arrested on corruption charges. She was convicted and jailed in 2018, but multiple health concerns meant she has spent most of the time since in a hospital.</p>

<p>It is unclear if she will be well enough to assume the Prime Minister's post, should she be selected.</p>

<p>The third is Mr Yunus, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006 for founding the Grameen Bank, a microfinance organisation working towards community development in Bangladesh.</p>

<p>Mr Yunus is widely seen as protesting students' pick - a bid to ensure the focus of their agitation does not get ignored as Sheikh Hasina's rivals scramble to pick up power following her resignation.</p>

<h3><strong>Who Is Md Yunus</strong></h3>

<p>An economist with a PhD from Vanderbilt University - a private research institution in Tennessee in the United States - Mr Yunus taught there briefly before returning to Bangladesh to head the department at Chittagong University.</p>

<p>He set up the Grameen Bank in 1983. The bank provides tiny loans (as small as Rs 2,000) to women in rural Bangladesh to start small businesses. This helped millions lift themselves out of poverty, earning him the nickname 'banker to the poor'. The model is now replicated in over 100 countries.</p>

<p>However, in June he was indicted on charges of corruption and embezzlement of 252.2 million taka (Rs 219.4 crore) from the workers' welfare fund of his telecoms company, Grameen Telecom.</p>

<p>The 83-year-old has denied wrongdoing and claimed the charges are politically motivated. In January, he was also sentenced to six months in prison for labour law violations but secured bail.</p>

<p>Also in the fray is Tariq Rahman, the exiled Chairperson of Mrs Zia's Bangladesh Nationalist Party.</p>

<p>As in the case of Khaleda Zia, there is no formal confirmation Mr Rahman will be party of any new government, but there is strong speculation to suggest Mrs Zia and her BNP could make a return.</p>

<p>Mr Rahman is widely expected to return to Bangladesh, at least according to news agency ANI, which quoted BNP Secretary General Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir to that effect.</p>

<p>A potential fifth figure is Nahid Islam, a Dhaka University student seen as the protest leader.</p>

<h3><strong>Who Is Nahid Islam</strong></h3>

<p>Mr Islam, a Sociology student, served as a National Coordinator for the 'Students Against Discrimination' Movement, which demanded reforms to the quota system for government jobs.</p>

<p>In the flurry of announcements and statements made last night Mr Islam claimed an outline for the interim government would be revealed within 24 hours.</p>

<p>Mr Nahid has been vocal against Sheikh Hasina's party, calling them "terrorists" on the roads.</p>

<p>In July he was abducted by at least 25 men in plain clothes from a house in Sabujbagh.</p>

<p>He was blindfolded, handcuffed and tortured during repeated interrogations about his involvement in the protests. Two days later, he was found unconscious and battered under a bridge in Purbachal.</p>

<p>He was kidnapped a second time a week later by individuals claiming to be from intelligence agencies, including the Dhaka Metropolitan Police's Detective Branch. But the police denied involvement.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Sheikh Hasina Resignation</strong></h3>

<p>Mrs Hasina, 76, a five-time PM and daughter of the country's founding father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman - quit and fled Dhaka Monday evening after weeks of violent protests over a government jobs quota.</p>

<p>Shortly after Ms Hasina resigned, Army chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman said the military will form an "interim government" and urged to protesters to stand down.</p>

<p>Over 400 people have died in clashes between authorities and mobs for and against the scheme assuring 30 per cent quota to family members of Bangladesh's 1971 war with Pakistan.</p>

<p>The protests that have roiled Bangladesh were sparked by Mrs Hasina's government announcing a 30 per cent quota for family members of her country's 1971 war of independence against Pakistan.</p>

<p>The students' movement gathered pace after the Bangladesh Supreme Court reinstated the quota, after first slashing it to five per cent. The students have alleged the quota is discriminatory.</p>

<p>Mrs Hasina left Dhaka in a military aircraft and flew to India's Hindon Air Force Base in Uttar Pradesh's Ghaziabad; she is expected to fly to London to claim political asylum.</p>

<p>Mrs Hasina was met on arrival by National Security Advisor Ajit Doval. There is no word yet if Prime Minister Narendra Modi will meet her.</p>

<p>Mr Modi has been briefed and External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar today chaired an all-party meeting to discuss the Bangladesh issue. He briefed all parties about steps being taken by the government to address potential security, economic, and diplomatic repercussions.</p>

<p>India's Border Security Force is on high alert across the country's 4,096 km border with Bangladesh, with field commanders ordered to take "on ground" positions and be prepared for anything. Indian Railways and the country's airlines have temporarily stopped services to Bangladesh.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>CrowdStrike's legal troubles from last month's massive global computer outage deepened on Monday, as the cybersecurity company was sued by air travellers whose flights were delayed or cancelled.</p>

<p>In a proposed class action filed in the Austin, Texas, federal court, three fliers blamed CrowdStrike's negligence in testing and deploying its software for the outage, which also disrupted banks, hospitals and emergency lines around the world.</p>

<p>The complainants said that as fliers scrambled to get to their destinations, many spent hundreds of dollars on lodging, meals and alternative travel, while others missed work or suffered health problems from having to sleep on the airport floor.</p>

<p>They said CrowdStrike should pay compensatory and punitive damages to anyone whose flight was disrupted after technology-related flight groundings for Southwest Airlines and other carriers in 2023 made the outage "entirely foreseeable."</p>

<p>CrowdStrike said in a statement: "We believe this case lacks merit and we will vigorously defend the company."</p>

<p>It provided an identical statement in response to a shareholder lawsuit filed on July 31, after the company's stock price had fallen by about one-third.</p>

<p>The outage stemmed from a flawed software update that crashed more than 8 million computers.</p>

<p>Delta Air Lines has said it may take legal action against Austin-based CrowdStrike after canceling more than 6,000 flights, at a cost of about $500 million.</p>

<p>On Sunday, CrowdStrike said it was neither grossly negligent nor at fault for Delta's problems, and that the Atlanta-based carrier did not accept its offer for help.</p>

<p>Delta faces a US Department of Transportation probe into why it needed more time than rivals to recover from the outage.</p>

<p>Monday's case is del Rio et al v CrowdStrike Inc,&nbsp;US District Court, Western District of Texas, No. 24-00881.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>John Schulman, one of the co-founders of artificial intelligence company OpenAI, has left the ChatGPT maker for rival Anthropic, he said in a post on social media platform X late Monday.</p>

<p>"This choice stems from my desire to deepen my focus on AI alignment, and to start a new chapter of my career where I can return to hands-on technical work," Schulman said in his X post.</p>

<p>OpenAI's President and co-founder Greg Brockman is also taking a sabbatical through the end of the year, he said in a X post late Monday.</p>

<p>The news was first reported by The Information, which added that Peter Deng, a product manager who joined OpenAI last year, has also exited the company.</p>

<p>OpenAI did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.</p>

<p>The move comes as OpenAI faces significant personnel changes, with the company's AI safety leader Aleksander Madry being reassigned to another role in July.</p>

<p>Another one of OpenAI's co-founders and chief scientist, Ilya Sutskever, left the company in May. Andrej Karpathy, who was also one of the AI firm's founding members left OpenAI in February and started an AI-integrated education platform in July.</p>

<p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who was also one of the co-founders of OpenAI and left three years later, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/elon-musk-revives-lawsuit-against-openai-ceo-sam-altman-6268971" target="_blank">revived his lawsuit</a> against the company and CEO Sam Altman on Monday, saying that the firm put profits and commercial interests ahead of public good.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Switzerland's Sonova on Tuesday introduced a hearing aid that utilises real-time artificial intelligence to improve speech clarity from background noise, the first such product in the global market.</p>

<p>Along with the hearing aid, named Sphere Infinio, Sonova is launching a new Infinio platform.</p>

<p>Sonova had said in May it expected major product launches to drive sales and profit growth in the second half of its fiscal year, without providing further details.</p>

<p>"The launch of both new platform and product should be a surprise to the market because nobody knew this technology and this benefit (real-time AI), which is quite significant, will be available for anyone already this year," CEO Arnd Kaldowski told Reuters in an interview.</p>

<p>Kaldowski reiterated that Sonova's second-half results were going to be stronger on a year-on-year basis, and confirmed its full-year outlook.</p>

<p>Sphere Infinio uses new DEEPSONIC chip technology that has 53 times more processing power than what is currently used by the hearing aid industry, the company said in a statement.</p>

<p>Sonova views Infinio and its existing Lumity platform as the main future growth drivers for its hearing instrument business, which brings in around half of its total sales.</p>

<p>The hearing aid industry has been showing signs of softer market dynamics in Europe and the US, while analysts have also flagged tough competition in the market.</p>

<p>A number of hearing aid firms, including Italy's Amplifon and Denmark's Demant and GN Store Nord, have warned on profits this summer, citing volatility in the market.</p>

<p>"We will need to see how the market evolves and the customer reaction to the products. But we are good with our full-year guidance even with the currently somewhat slower market," Kaldowski said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel's assassination of Hamas' political leader will have far-reaching consequences for any chance in peace in the Middle East</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-08-03/iran-says-ismail-haniyeh-was-killed-by-short-range-projectile-/104180416"><u>assassination of Hamas political chief Ismail Haniyeh</u></a>&nbsp;in Tehran, where he was attending the inauguration of Iranian President Mesud Pezeshkian, &nbsp;is a watershed moment, marking the intensification of the ongoing Israeli-Palestine war.</p>

<p>While Israel always maintained a policy of hitting Hamas leaders anywhere in the world, there has been an understanding between Israel and the Arab states about not targeting them outside Palestine.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Haniyeh's assassination is the first such targeted killing since the 2010 death of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2010/02/dubai_police_chief_99_sure_mos.html">Hamas leader Mohmoud Al Mabhouh</a>&nbsp;in Dubai.</p>

<p>Haniyeh, who was seen as a pragmatist capable of uniting Hamas' competing factions and the nearest thing to a statesman the organisation had, had emerged as a far more significant threat to Israel than anyone else inside Hamas.&nbsp;</p>

<p>His elimination is one of the biggest achievements of Israeli intelligence and embattled Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Indeed, it could be a lifeline for Netanyahu, who is deeply unpopular in Israel for his handling of the conflict.</p>

<h3><b>Dangerous escalation</b></h3>

<p>But it is also a dangerous escalation and could have serious implications for the region and its fragile security arrangement, with Iran threatening&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c6p2ydk7er1o"><u>revenge</u></a>&nbsp;for Haniyeh's killing.</p>

<p>Israel has broken several established rules on which the fragile regional security depended for so long.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Israel's regional security doctrine depended on two principles.</p>

<p>First, as the Arab streets have been massively unhappy with their regimes for a very long time, the plight of Palestinian people continues to be the biggest source of anger and frustration.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Without a brutal repressive system in place, Arab public opinion would have become violent as happened during the failed Arab uprisings in 2010.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The ruling class often distributes subsidies and freebies and relies on more radical&nbsp;<a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/islamism-salafism-and-jihadism-a-primer/"><u>Salafi Islamism</u></a>&nbsp;(pure or authentic Islam, found in the lived example of the early, righteous generations of Muslims, known as the&nbsp;<i>Salaf</i>) to calm down the populace.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Since the Gaza war, Arab opinion has been&nbsp;<a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/america-losing-arab-world"><u>dangerously anti-American and anti-Western</u></a>, and Israel's expanding war theatre beyond Gaza is pushing Arab regimes deeper into troubled waters.</p>

<p>To keep a lid on boiling public opinion is one of the most important aspects that Israel had to help the Gulf States achieve.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But with this Gaza war — in which more than 39,000 Gazans, including 14,000 children, have been killed — Israel has done serious harm to the Gulf and Arab States' ability to control their population.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Second, the fragile security in the region stands on secret bilateral and regional agreements between Israel, the United States and the Gulf regimes to pursue a common security arrangement.&nbsp;</p>

<p>That is to keep radical Islam and its allies, Iran and its proxies, away from gaining any influence in the region, at any cost.</p>

<p>The current Gaza war and the assassination of Haniyeh will further discredit pro-West Arabs and their initiatives on Palestine, including the Abraham Accords.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the last few decades, Gulf states have separated Gulf security from the wider Arab security.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><b>Iran a bigger threat</b></h3>

<p>For Arab security, the resolution of the Palestinian crisis still remains the most important issue to be resolved while for Gulf security,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.chathamhouse.org/publications/the-world-today/2024-02/gulf-states-have-power-revive-two-state-solution"><u>Iran remains a bigger threat</u></a>&nbsp;than the Israeli occupation.</p>

<p>As a result, any Gulf-led initiative for Palestine has been primarily driven by its quest to sideline Iran and its proxies.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the last few years, Iran and the Gulf states have joined&nbsp;<a href="https://carnegieindia.org/research/2024/08/how-gulf-states-are-reinterpreting-national-security-beyond-their-land-borders-abdullah-baabood?lang=en&amp;center=middle-east"><u>China -mediated dialogue</u></a>&nbsp;for regional security.</p>

<p>In this Gaza crisis, the Americans and Israelis may lose some of the Gulf states, particularly Saudi Arabia, in their plans to revive the Abraham Accords.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Egypt, Jordan and other Arab states have become more frustrated over being sidelined by the Gulf states and for sacrificing Arab security to the Gulf security.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Finally, Haniyeh's assassination has weakened and divided the Palestinian Authority, helping everyone except Palestinians and their prospects of achieving statehood. Today's Palestinian authority has lost its appeal and influence as it once had under the charismatic leadership of Yasser Arafat.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hamas has filled the gap left by the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.arabnews.com/node/2395986/middle-east"><u>unpopular and corrupt&nbsp;</u></a>leadership of Mahmoud Abbas. By killing Hamas' top leader, Israel has unilaterally changed the rules of Arab and Gulf security.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The new Palestinian response to the Gaza crisis may not be totally in control of the Gulf states as the Americans and Israelis would have desired.</p>

<p>Egypt heavily relied on Hamas to maintain the fragile security between Gaza and the Sinai Peninsula. Egypt felt betrayed and isolated by the Americans and Israelis. The assassination is a serious setback for Egypt as well.&nbsp;</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sheikh Hasina did not want to resign as Bangladesh Prime Minister and wanted security forces to intensify the crackdown on nationwide protests, but security bosses said the protests cannot be contained by force, according to a report in Prothom Alo newspaper.</p>

<p>The report details what went down in the Prime Minister's official residence before her last-minute escape in a military aircraft, shortly before hundreds of protesters stormed in and went on the rampage.</p>

<p><strong>Morning Meet With Security Chiefs</strong></p>

<p>According to the Prothom Alo report, the Awami League leader called the top officers of the security establishment and police force to her residence. The death count was rising, and some of her advisors had tried to talk her into transferring the power to the Army. But the 76-year-old five-time Prime Minister was adamant. She asked the forces to strengthen the curfew already in place. On the streets, however, the situation was changing fast. Despite the curfew, protesters had started gathering at various spots in Dhaka.</p>

<p>At her meeting with the security bosses, she questioned why they had not been able to contain the protests. She pointed to visuals of protesters climbing atop police vehicles and asked why the forces were not cracking down harder. At one point, she reminded them that they had been elevated to these positions because she trusted them.</p>

<p>During the meeting, Sheikh Hasina praised police's response to the protests. But the police chief conveyed that the situation is such that police won't be able to contain it for long.</p>

</div>

<p><strong>Son Convinced Hasina To Leave</strong></p>

<p>The security forces, the report says, tried to explain to her that more force is not the answer. But the veteran leader did not budge. Then the officers spoke to Sheikh Hasina's sister Rehana in another room and urged her to convince the Prime Minister to step down. Rehana spoke to Hasina, but that did not help. At this point, Sheikh Hasina's son Sajeeb Wazed Joy stepped in. Based in the US, Joy spoke to his mother and managed to convince her to resign.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/she-didnt-want-to-leave-we-insisted-sheikh-hasinas-son-to-ndtv-6271386">Speaking to NDTV</a>, Joy yesterday said his mother did not want to leave Bangladesh. "She wanted to stay, she did not want to leave the country at all. But we kept insisting that it wasn't safe for her. We were concerned for her physical safety first; so we persuaded her to leave," he said.</p>

<p>"I spoke to her this morning. The situation in Bangladesh, as you can see, is anarchy. She is in good spirits, but she is very disappointed. It's very disheartening for her because it was her dream to turn Bangladesh into a developed country and she worked so hard for it over the last 15 years, keeping it safe from militants and as well as from terrorism and in spite of all of that this vocal minority, the opposition, the militants have now seized power," he said.</p>

<p><strong>The Speech That Was Not Recorded</strong></p>

<p>The crowd of protesters was swelling, and intelligence inputs said Ganabhaban -- the Prime Minister's official residence -- may be stormed. Sheikh Hasina was given 45 minute to pack up. She wanted to record one last speech addressing the people of the country, but there was no time. Accompanied by sister Rehana, she left hom. There was a short halt at Bangabhaban, the Bangladesh President's official residence, where she completed the resignation formalities.</p>

<p>Around 2.30 pm, the ousted leader took off in a military aircraft, bringing the curtain down on her 15-year uninterrupted term. Her ouster and flight also represents a massive shift in Bangladesh politics. Fifty years after her father and Bangladesh's tallest leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahaman led the struggle for the country's independence, Ms Hasina was forced to flee as protesters vandalised her father's statues. The legacy of Mujibur Rahman, fondly known as Bangabandhu, is no longer a symbol of Bangladesh's war of liberation. Instead, it represents her daughter's politics that protesters claim focused on suppressing dissent.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><strong>What Led To This</strong></div>
</div>

<p>The protests in Bangladesh, which began last month, started as an agitation against a quota system under which 30 per cent of government jobs were reserved for family members of Muktijoddhas -- those who fought in Bangladesh's war of independence in 1971. The protesters said this system favours supporters of the ruling Awami League and wanted a merit-based system to replace it. As the protests grew, the Awami League dispensation tried to crush it with an iron fist. And then, a remark by Hasina sparked fury. "If not the grandchildren of the freedom fighters, then who will get quota benefits? The grandchildren of the 'Razakars'?" she asked. A paramilitary force recruited by the Pakistan Army during the 1971 liberation war, Razakars carried out mass atrocities, including mass killings, rapes, and torture. Naturally, the remark touched a raw nerve.</p>

<p>Reservation has been a burning issue in Bangladesh for years now. In 2018, an agitation on this issue forced the government to water down the reservation system and cancelled quotas for some positions.</p>

<p>The latest unrest was sparked by a high court order that declared illegal the 2018 government circular cancelling 30 per cent quota for freedom fighters' descendants in government jobs. This order was scrapped by the country's Supreme Court. The Supreme Court ordered that 93 per cent of government jobs must be allocated on merit and the remaining be reserved for relatives of freedom fighters. But even the top court's order could not pacify the protesters.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There could be a conspiracy angle in former Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's ouster, the government said at today's all-party meeting on the situation in the violence-hit country, sources have said.</p>

<p>Foreign Minister S Jaishankar, it is learnt, said that several political players could be involved in the conspiracy to topple Sheikh Hasina government in Bangladesh.</p>

<p>Mr Jaishnakar was responding to Congress MP Rahul Gandhi who had asked if there could be an involvement of foreign powers, specifically Pakistan, in the dramatic developments in Dhaka over the past few weeks.</p>

<p>The government has been keeping a watch on the evolving situation and all possible angles were being looked into, he said.</p>

<p>The Foreign Minister briefed the leaders of all parties about steps taken by the Indian government to address the potential security, economic, and diplomatic repercussions of this situation.</p>

<p>He said that the government is in touch with the Bangladeshi Army - which is set to form an interim government after Ms Hasina's ouster - to ensure the safety of Indian nationals and the minorities in Bangladesh.</p>

<p>Mr Jaishankar said the government is giving time to Sheikh Hasina - who arrived in India after her ouster - to "recover" and let them know about her next move.</p>

<p>Besides S Jaishankar, Home Minister Amit Shah, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Kiren Rijiju also attended the meeting.</p>

<p>Ms Hasina landed at the Hindon Air Force base in Uttar Pradesh's Ghaziabad, which is 30km from Delhi last evening. She was received by National Security Advisor Ajit Doval.</p>

<p>Sheikh Hasina is expected to leave for London later, sources told NDTV, where she may seek political asylum. However, there is no confirmation on whether the UK has offered asylum to her.</p>

<p>Sheikh Hasina had sought to quell nationwide protests against her government but she fled the country after fresh clashes on Sunday in which nearly 100 people were killed.</p>

<p>The anti-government rallies that began last month against civil service job quotas escalated into some of the worst unrest of Prime Minister Hasina's 15-year rule and shifted into wider calls for the 76-year-old to step down.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Egypt has proposed an initial two-day ceasefire in Gaza to exchange four Israeli hostages of Hamas for some Palestinian prisoners, Egypt's president said on Sunday as Israeli military strikes killed 45 Palestinians across the enclave.</p>

<p>Egyptian leader Abdel Fattah al-Sisi made the announcement as efforts to defuse the devastating, more than year-long war resumed in Qatar with the directors of the CIA and Israel's Mossad intelligence agency taking part.</p>

<p>Speaking alongside Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune during a press conference in Cairo, Sisi also said that talks should resume within 10 days of implementing the temporary ceasefire in efforts to reach a permanent one.</p>

<p>There was no immediate comment from Israel or Hamas but a Palestinian official close to the mediation effort told Reuters: "I expect Hamas would listen to the new offers, but it remains determined that any agreement must end the war and get Israeli forces out of Gaza."</p>

<p>Israel has said the war cannot end until Hamas has been wiped out as a military force and governing entity in Gaza.</p>

<p>The US, Qatar and Egypt have been spearheading negotiations to end the war that erupted after Hamas fighters entered southern Israel on October 7 last year, killing 1,200 people and taking more than 250 hostages, by Israeli tallies.</p>

<p>The death count from Israel's retaliatory air and ground onslaught in Gaza is approaching 43,000, Gaza health officials say, with the densely populated enclave in ruins.</p>

<p>An official briefed on the talks told Reuters earlier on Sunday that negotiations in Doha will seek a short-term ceasefire and the release of some hostages being held by Hamas in exchange for Israel's release of Palestinian prisoners.</p>

<p>The objective, still elusive after multiple mediation attempts, is to get Israel and Hamas to agree to a halt in fighting for less than a month in the hope this would lead to a more permanent ceasefire.</p>

<p>At least 43 of those killed in Gaza on Sunday were in the north of the enclave, where Israeli troops have returned to root out Hamas fighters who it says have regrouped there.</p>

<p><strong>'UNBEARABLE' CONDITIONS IN NORTH GAZA</strong></p>

<p>The United Nations said the plight of Palestinian civilians in northern Gaza was "unbearable" and the conflict was being "waged with little regard for the requirements of international humanitarian law".</p>

<p>"The Secretary-General (Antonio Guterres) is shocked by the harrowing levels of death, injury and destruction in the north, with civilians trapped under rubble, the sick and wounded going without life-saving health care, and families lacking food and shelter, amid reports of families being separated and many people detained," U.N. spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said in a statement.</p>

<p>Israeli authorities were hampering efforts to deliver food, medicine and other essential humanitarian supplies, putting lives at risk, he said. The devastation and deprivation resulting from Israeli military operations in the north were making life there untenable.</p>

<p>Israel says its forces operate in accordance with international law. It says it targets Hamas operatives who conceal themselves among the civilian population which they use as human shields, a charge Hamas denies.</p>

<p>It denies blocking humanitarian aid to Gaza, blaming international organisations for problems distributing it and accusing Hamas of stealing from aid convoys.</p>

<p><strong>JABALIA IN FOCUS</strong></p>

<p>Earlier on Sunday, 20 people were killed following an airstrike on houses in Jabalia, the largest of the Gaza Strip's eight historic refugee camps, which has been the focus of an Israeli military offensive for more than three weeks, medics and the Palestinian official news agency WAFA said.</p>

<p>Another Israeli airstrike on a school sheltering displaced Palestinian families in Shati camp in Gaza City, killed nine people and wounded 20 others, with many in critical condition, medics said.</p>

<p>Footage circulated on Palestinian media, which Reuters could not immediately verify, showed people rushing to the bomb site to help evacuate the casualties. Bodies were scattered on the ground, while some carried wounded children in their arms before loading them in a vehicle.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said it was looking into the report on the strike on the school.</p>

<p>Three local journalists were among those killed at the school in Shati - Saed Radwan, head of digital media at Hamas Al-Aqsa television, Hanin Baroud, and Hamza Abu Selmeya, according to Hamas media.</p>

<p>On Sunday, Israel's military said it had killed more than 40 militants in the Jabalia area in the past 24 hours, as well as dismantling infrastructure and locating large quantities of military equipment.</p>

<p>Israeli military strikes on the towns of Jabalia, Beit Hanoun and Beit Lahiya in northern Gaza have so far killed around 800 people during a three-week offensive, the Gaza health ministry said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Israeli military on Sunday said five soldiers were killed in southern Lebanon, bringing to 37 the death count for soldiers fighting there since the start of ground operations on September 30.</p>

<p>The soldiers "fell during combat in southern Lebanon," the army said in a statement, adding that they were killed on Saturday.</p>

<p>Hezbollah began launching rockets at Israel on October 8, 2023, in support of Hamas after the Palestinian group launched its unprecedented attack on Israel the previous day.</p>

<p>Israel dramatically escalated its air strikes on Lebanon late last month before launching ground operations in southern Lebanon.</p>

<p>The war has left at least 1,615 people dead in Lebanon since September 23, according to an AFP tally based on official figures, though the real number is likely to be higher due to gaps in the data.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>King Charles III's cancer diagnosis will not prevent him flying abroad next year for foreign visits, a Buckingham Palace official said, as the monarch wrapped up a tour of Australia and Samoa.</p>

<p>"We're now working on a pretty normal looking full overseas tour programme for next year, which is a high for us to end on, to know that we can be thinking in those terms," the official said late Saturday.</p>

<p>King Charles was diagnosed with an undisclosed cancer earlier this year but doctors agreed he could pause his treatment to allow him to travel to Australia and Samoa.</p>

<p>The palace announced in April that he would make a limited return to public duties, as doctors were "very encouraged" by his progress.</p>

<p>The official added that the king had "thrived" on the tour's programme which had lifted "his spirits, his mood and his recovery".</p>

<p>"In that sense, the tour, despite its demands, has been the perfect tonic," he added.</p>

<p>The tour was King Charles' first to Australia, where he is also head of state, since he became king following the death of Queen Elizabeth II in September 2022.</p>

<p>King Charles and Queen Camilla left Samoa Saturday after the marathon 11-day tour that saw the king carry out more than 30 engagements.</p>

<p>The royal couple visited Sydney, Canberra and the Samoan capital Apia, where King Charles attended a meeting of Commonwealth nations.</p>

<p>The 56-nation bloc -- made up mostly of British ex-colonies -- had hoped to focus on a future threatened by climate change, but instead bickered over a troubled past marked by slavery and colonisation.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The sudden relocation caused significant distress to Ash, who began exhibiting signs of respiratory distress, including heavy panting and gasping for air.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A lawsuit filed against Alaska Airlines alleges negligence in the death of a French bulldog during a flight from New York to San Francisco. Michael Contillo, a San Francisco resident, claims that his beloved pet, Ash, died due to the airline's mishandling, the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/alaska-airlines-dog-dies-flight-first-class-coach-b2634145.html" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>Independent</em></a> reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mr Contillo and his father had purchased first-class tickets to ensure ample space and comfort for their two French bulldogs, Ash and Kora. Before the flight, both dogs were examined by a veterinarian and declared fit to fly. However, Alaska Airlines staff insisted on moving the passengers and their pets further back in the plane, citing safety concerns.</p>

<p>The sudden relocation caused significant distress to Ash, who began exhibiting signs of respiratory distress, including heavy panting and gasping for air. Mr Contillo was unable to monitor his pet during takeoff and landing due to airline regulations. Upon arriving at San Francisco International Airport, Mr Contillo discovered that Ash had died.</p>

<p><strong>The lawsuit highlights several key allegations against Alaska Airlines:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Negligence in Handling Brachycephalic Breeds: The airline allegedly failed to consider the specific needs of brachycephalic breeds like French bulldogs, which are particularly vulnerable to respiratory problems during air travel.</li>
	<li>Breach of Contract: The lawsuit claims that Alaska Airlines breached the contract by downgrading the passengers from first class without a valid reason.</li>
	<li>Inadequate Staff Training: Mr Contillo alleges that the airline's staff lacked proper training in handling animals, especially those with specific health concerns.</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to seeking financial compensation, Mr Contillo is also seeking punitive damages to hold Alaska Airlines accountable for its negligence. The lawsuit emphasizes the emotional distress caused by the loss of his pet and the airline's lack of empathy following the incident.</p>

<p>The American Veterinary Medical Association has warned that brachycephalic breeds are at a higher risk of respiratory issues during air travel. The organization recommends that these breeds should be kept in the passenger cabin and not transported as cargo or in confined areas.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Israel's airstrikes "hit hard" Iran's defences and missile production, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday, but Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said the damage from Saturday's attack should not be exaggerated.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel's airstrikes "hit hard" Iran's defences and missile production, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday, but Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said the damage from Saturday's attack should not be exaggerated.</p>

<p>With warfare raging in Gaza and Lebanon, direct confrontation between Israel and Iran risks spiralling into a regional conflagration. But a day after the airstrikes, there was no sign they would spark another round of escalation.</p>

<p>However, heavy fighting in Lebanon between Israeli forces and Iran-backed Hezbollah, which sharply intensified over recent weeks, continued on Sunday with an Israeli airstrike killing eight people in a residential block in Sidon, medics said.</p>

<p>"The air force attacked throughout Iran. We hit hard Iran's defence capabilities and its ability to produce missiles that are aimed at us," Netanyahu said in a speech, calling the attack "precise and powerful" and saying it met all its objectives.</p>

<p>The Islamic Republic has not signalled how it will respond to Saturday's long-anticipated strikes, which involved scores of fighter jets bombing targets near the capital Tehran and in the western provinces of Ilam and Khuzestan.</p>

<p>The heavily armed arch-enemies have engaged in a cycle of retaliatory moves against each other for months, with Saturday's strike coming after an Iranian missile barrage on Oct. 1, much of which Israel said was downed by its air defences.</p>

<p>Khamenei said Israel's calculations "should be disrupted". The attack on Iran, which killed four soldiers and caused some damage, "should neither be downplayed nor exaggerated", he said.</p>

<p>The Iranian parliament speaker, Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf, said Iran was entitled to self-defence and its response "will be definite, in compliance with the requirements".</p>

<p>U.S. President Joe Biden called for a halt to escalation that has raised fears of a wider Middle East war arising from the year-old Israeli-Hamas conflict in Gaza and Israel's thrust into south Lebanon to stop Hezbollah rocketing northern Israel.</p>

<p>Separately, Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said Iran was no longer able to use its allies Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon against Israel. The two groups "are no longer an effective tool" of Tehran, he said in a speech.</p>

<p>Gallant added that Hamas was no longer functioning as a military network in Gaza and that Hezbollah's senior command and most of its missile capabilities had been eliminated.</p>

<p>Hamas has repeatedly said it is still able to function militarily, and Israel has recently conducted major new operations in devastated north Gaza against what it calls regrouping Hamas militants.</p>

<p>Hezbollah has said its command structure remains intact and that it retains significant missile capabilities.</p>

<p><strong>LEBANON FIGHTING</strong></p>

<p>On Sunday, the Israeli military urged residents of 14 villages in southern Lebanon to evacuate immediately and move north of the Awali river.</p>

<p>An Israeli strike on Sidon, a city in coastal south Lebanon, killed at least eight people and wounded 25 on Sunday, the country's health ministry said.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in the south, a strike on Zawtar al-Sharkiya killed three people and a Saturday bombing of Marjayoun killed five, it said.</p>

<p>Israel said four of its soldiers were killed in south Lebanon fighting.</p>

<p>Hezbollah also said it had fired a large missile salvo at the Zevulon military industries facility north of Haifa in northern Israel. Hezbollah rockets hit a house and cars and rescue crews responded to put out the fire.</p>

<p>One woman was seriously injured, according to Israel's ambulance service.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[In a bid to address its persistent external financing issues, Pakistan has formally requested a supplementary loan of 10 billion yuan (CNY) (approximately USD 1.4 billion) from China.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p>

<p>In a bid to address its persistent external financing issues, Pakistan has formally requested a supplementary loan of 10 billion yuan (CNY) (approximately USD 1.4 billion) from China.</p>

<p>The announcement was made on Saturday, underscoring the fiscal pressures the nation continues to face, the Express Tribune reported.</p>

<p>During a meeting with China's Vice Minister of Finance, Liao Min, Pakistan's Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb urged the Chinese side to elevate the limits under the Currency Swap Agreement to CNY 40 billion. As stated by the Ministry of Finance, Pakistan has already fully utilised the existing CNY 30 billion (USD 4.3 billion) Chinese trade facility for debt repayment and is now seeking to raise this limit by an additional CNY 10 billion, which translates to USD 1.4 billion based on current exchange rates.</p>

<p>The finance minister's appeal occurred on the sidelines of the annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank. If approved by Beijing, the total facility would amount to approximately USD 5.7 billion.</p>

<p>This request is not unprecedented; Pakistan has previously sought increases in its debt limit, but Beijing has declined these appeals in the past. Notably, this request follows closely behind China's extension of the current USD 4.3 billion (CNY 30 billion) facility for an additional three years. This extension was formalised during the recent visit of Chinese Prime Minister Li Qiang, which also saw the debt repayment period for Pakistan extended to 2027.</p>

<p>Pakistan has fully consumed the existing trade finance facility of USD 4.3 billion under the China-Pakistan currency swap agreement. Although the Ministry of Finance did not specify the reasons behind the new request, reports suggest that uncertainties regarding some pipeline loans have prompted the need for additional financial support.</p>

<p>In a parallel move to fill the financing gap, Pakistan accepted terms for a costly USD 600 million commercial loan. However, this decision raised concerns, leading the IMF to clarify that the loan was not tied to the requirements of Pakistan's USD 7 billion bailout package. Aurangzeb later informed the National Assembly Standing Committee on Finance that the government secured USD 600 million in financing at an 11 per cent interest rate for IMF program purposes.</p>

<p>The finance ministry confirmed that both ministers reiterated the strength of the all-weather strategic cooperative partnership between Pakistan and China. Originally signed in December 2011, the bilateral currency swap agreement (CSA) aimed to promote bilateral trade, foreign direct investment, and provide short-term liquidity support.</p>

<p>In the fiscal year 2021, the initial limit of the CSA was extended from 20 billion CNY to 30 billion CNY (USD 4.5 billion) for a period of three years, with maturity periods ranging from three months to one year, according to the central bank.</p>

<p>This is not the first instance of Pakistan seeking an increase in its loan limit from China; in November 2022, then-Finance Minister Ishaq Dar also requested an additional 10 billion yuan (USD 1.5 billion) due to delays in loans from other bilateral and multilateral creditors.</p>

<p>Pakistan has primarily utilised the Chinese trade finance facility to repay foreign debts and stabilise its foreign currency reserves, preventing potential market turmoil. The current USD 4.3 billion facility is part of the State Bank of Pakistan's foreign exchange reserves, which are approximately USD 11 billion. Additionally, China has extended USD 4 billion in SAFE deposits, which are included in these reserves, along with another USD 4 billion in commercial loans. Despite these supports, Pakistan's foreign exchange reserves remain insufficient to meet its debt obligations to China.</p>

<p>The finance ministry stated that Aurangzeb expressed gratitude to the Chinese government for its unwavering support in Pakistan's socio-economic development and assistance in securing the IMF's Extended Fund Facility (EFF).</p>

<p>Furthermore, the finance minister highlighted Pakistan's eagerness to learn from China's experience in economic reform and mentioned plans to issue an inaugural Panda bond in the Chinese market to diversify its financing options.</p>

<p>Aurangzeb also assured China of comprehensive security measures for Chinese workers in Pakistan. Both parties emphasised the importance of enhancing online payment settlements and integrating the two nations' payment systems, marking a collaborative step forward in their economic partnership.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant warned Sunday that "painful concessions" would be needed to secure the release of hostages held in Gaza and that military action alone will not achieve the country's war aims.</p>

<p>"Not all objectives can be achieved through military operations alone... to realise our moral duty to bring our hostages home, we will have to make painful concessions," Gallant said, in a speech marking the Hebrew calendar anniversary of the Hamas attack on October 7 last year.</p>

<p>Gallant went on to name the country's military accomplishments in over a year of fighting.</p>

<p>"In the south, Hamas has ceased to act as a military structure, in the north, Hezbollah continues to suffer blows and its leadership has been eliminated, the majority of its rocket arsenal has been destroyed and its forces have retreated from the border line," he added.</p>

<p>Hamas's October 7 attack resulted in the deaths of 1,206 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of official Israeli figures.</p>

<p>At least 42,924 Palestinians, a majority of them civilians, have since been killed in the Israeli offensive on Gaza, according to figures from the Hamas-ruled territory's health ministry, which the UN considers reliable.</p>

<p>The war has also drawn in Iran-backed groups across the region, most notably Hezbollah in Lebanon, where Israel has launched a major aerial campaign and ground incursions since late September.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lebanon's health ministry said at least eight people were killed and 25 others wounded Sunday in an Israeli strike near the southern city of Sidon, where an AFP correspondent said a building was targeted.</p>

<p>The strike hit a densely-populated area in a Sidon suburb that saw an influx of families displaced from areas further south.</p>

<p>It was the first strike there since the Israel-Hezbollah war erupted last month.</p>

<p>"The Israeli enemy's raid on Haret Saida resulted in a... toll of eight killed," the health ministry said, revising an earlier toll of two dead.</p>

<p>The official National News Agency said a child was among the victims.</p>

<p>An AFP correspondent said one apartment was destroyed in the strike on a three-storey residential complex.</p>

<p>Surrounding shops and buildings were also damaged, the correspondent said, as paramedics rushed to the site of the attack to search for survivors.</p>

<p>The Israeli army had issued an evacuation warning for several areas in south Lebanon on Sunday, but Haret Saida was not listed among the areas to be targeted.</p>

<p>The war since September 23 has left at least 1,615 people dead in Lebanon, according to an AFP tally of nationwide health ministry figures, though the real number is likely to be higher due to gaps in the data.</p>

<p>At least 1.3 million people have been displaced, more than 800,000 of them within Lebanon's borders, according to the UN's migration agency.</p>

<p>More than half a million people have crossed into Syria, according to Lebanese authorities, most of them Syrians.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Screaming relatives of Hamas attack victims interrupted a speech by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday during October 7 commemorations.</p>

<p>Netanyahu stood motionless at a lectern during the ceremony in Jerusalem as audience members in the crowd shouted, interrupting him for more than a minute, according to a live broadcast of the speech.</p>

<p>One of the protesters repeatedly shouted, "My father was killed".</p>

<p>Public and diplomatic pressure has been on Netanyahu's administration to do more to strike a deal for securing the release of captives still held in Gaza.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Netanyahu?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Netanyahu</a> | "Be ashamed of yourself"... Hurtful words from the families of Israeli prisoners of the resistance attack Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during his speech on the anniversary of Operation Al-Aqsa Flood. <a href="https://t.co/uASeLsk1co">pic.twitter.com/uASeLsk1co</a></p>

<p>Israeli spy chief David Barnea is scheduled to head to Doha on Sunday for talks aimed at restarting negotiations towards reaching a Gaza hostage release deal.</p>

<p>Families of the remaining hostages along with several Western leaders have called on the Israeli government to broker an agreement after the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar earlier this month.</p>

<p>Israeli and US officials as well as some analysts said Sinwar had been a key obstacle to a deal allowing for the release of 97 hostages still held by militants in Gaza, 34 of whom the Israeli military says are dead.</p>

<p>Critics in Israel have also accused Netanyahu of obstructing mediation for a truce and hostage-release deal.</p>

<p>Earlier Sunday, Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said military action by itself will not achieve the country's war aims, which include bringing home the hostages.</p>

<p>"Not all objectives can be achieved through military operations alone... To realise our moral duty to bring our hostages home, we will have to make painful concessions," Gallant said in a separate speech marking the Hebrew calendar anniversary of the Hamas attack, which on October 7 last triggered the ongoing war in the Palestinian territory.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Support has poured in for the family of Gursimran Kaur, a 19-year-old Walmart employee found dead earlier this month in a walk-in oven at a Canadian Walmart store.&nbsp;The Maritime Sikh Society, to which Ms Kaur's family belongs, announced in an update on their <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-the-family-of-gursimran-who-lost-her-life-at-walmart" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>GoFundMe page </em></a>on Friday, October 25, that they had raised over $194,949 to assist her "bereaved family," some of whom had been in India and were working to travel to Canada for her funeral.</p>

<p>"We want to express our deepest gratitude to everyone who has donated to support Gursimran Kaur's family during this unimaginable time. Your kindness and generosity have been a source of strength for the family as they navigate through this tragedy," a representative of the group shared.</p>

<p>The society also announced that they would "turn off donations" to begin "distributing the funds to the family," with the contributions intended to support them in the coming steps.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"... We cannot thank you enough for standing with them during this painful period," the representative continued. "Thank you again for your support, compassion, and for being a part of this effort to help Gursimran's family in their time of need."</p>

<p>According to Halifax Regional Police, Ms Kaur was found dead inside an oven in the bakery section of a Halifax Walmart on the night of Saturday, October 19.</p>

<p>The Maritime Sikh Society described Kaur as "a young beautiful girl who came to Canada with big dreams." She had been at the store with her mother, who, after losing contact with her for an hour, eventually found her inside the oven. Both Kaur and her mother had been employed at the Walmart store for two years.</p>

<p>Constable Martin Cromwell told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://people.com/family-of-walmart-employee-who-died-in-oven-share-gratitude-for-public-support-8734910" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>PEOPLE</em></a> on Oct. 25 that police have not yet determined how Kaur entered the oven, noting that the investigation is "complex."<br />

       <description><![CDATA[Tommy Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, is once again making headlines as a prominent figure in the UK's far-right movement.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thousands of supporters of Tommy Robinson, gathered in London for a "Unite the Kingdom" rally, to oppose immigration policies on Saturday. Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, is once again making headlines as a prominent figure in the UK's far-right movement. The rally saw a massive police presence, &nbsp;to prevent clashes with counter-protesters.</p>

<p>Robinson has been a polarizing figure in British politics since he founded the English Defence League (EDL), a far-right Islamophobic organization, in 2009. Despite organizing the rally, he was unable to attend it due to his arrest on Friday.</p>

<p>Recently, Robinson has been at the centre of unrest in the UK following a mass stabbing incident in Southport that caused the deaths of three children. He allegedly spread misinformation on social media, falsely claiming that the assailant was a Muslim asylum seeker, leading to violent riots across the country, with demonstrators chanting his name and escalating tensions between far-right groups and anti-racism activists.</p>

<p>As reported by Reuters, Saturday's demonstration occurred amid rising tensions over immigration, with over 29,578 asylum seekers having crossed the English Channel this year-more than the total for all of 2023. His supporters argue that Britain is under siege from not only immigration but also "Islamification," while critics, including Prime Minister Keir Starmer, label the unrest fuelled by them, as racist.</p>

<p class="ins_instory_dv_caption"><span class="ins_instory_span_credit">Photo Credit: AFP</span></p>
</div>

<p>Saturday's rally saw participants waving British flags and carrying placards which resonated with&nbsp; Robinson's nationalist sentiments. Police were deployed from across the country to monitor both events and ensure public safety. Many were seen carrying banners featuring slogans about former US President Donald Trump, reflecting the influence of a shared right-wing ideology across the globe.</p>

<p>Known for his anti-Islam rhetoric, Robinson has previously faced multiple criminal convictions, including assault and contempt of court. His controversial statements and actions have led to bans from major social media platforms as well. However, he regained access to social media platform X (formerly, Twitter) after its acquisition by Elon Musk.</p>

<p>He is currently in police custody facing charges related to contempt of court for repeatedly breaching an injunction that prohibits him from making defamatory statements about Syrian refugee Jamal Hijazi. In 2021, Robinson was found guilty of libel after falsely accusing Hijazi of assaulting girls at school. Robinson's court appearance is scheduled for Monday. If convicted, he be sentenced to up to 4 years in prison.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-10/m5vu5teo_narendra-modi-olaf-scholz-german-chancellor-pti_625x300_25_October_24.jpg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>Following nuclear testing in 1998, the Singh-Talbott talks provided the framework for shifting the Indo-US relationship from "estranged democracies" to "engaged democracies." A comparable transition is already ongoing between Germany and India, as seen by Germany's "<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/blob/2680288/8909ac2c501ab85d55defff7d1b8b75d/241016-fokus-indien-data.pdf">Focus on India</a>" policy. This move is underscored before Chancellor Olaf Scholz's October 2024 visit to New Delhi, indicating a growing realization that India is not just a key regional actor but also an important partner in the global arena.&nbsp;Indian External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar's 2022 statement, "Europe must grow out of the mindset that its problems are the world's problems," resonates strongly with Germany's stance, which coincides with a more pragmatic and multipolar world order.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Chancellor Scholz's Visit and Growing Partnership&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Chancellor Scholz's visit to India is a significant milestone in the growing Indo-German partnership. His schedule included the Asia-Pacific Conference of German Businesses in Delhi, where he and Prime Minister Modi spoke to senior industry leaders from both countries. With bilateral commerce reaching a record high of Euro 30 billion in 2023 and strong German interest in India's technology and manufacturing sectors, this conference provided an opportunity to transform economic engagement into a long-term industrial collaboration. The visit further channelled the Green and Sustainable Partnership between India and Germany. Furthermore, the two countries began commemoration of the 25th anniversary of their strategic Partnership, providing an appropriate backdrop for Scholz's visit and demonstrating the maturity of the relationship. Scholz emphasized on contribution of the Indian diaspora in the growth of Germany and released India India-specific <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bmas.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/EN/a798e-skilled-labour-strategy-india.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&amp;v=1">Skilled Labour Strategy</a>.</p>

<p><strong>A New Realization in the West</strong></p>

<p>The release of two India-specific documents signals the post-Markel era in the India-German partnership. The tone and content of those two documents indicate a positive alignment towards India. The Scholz administration has appreciated the vitality of Indian democracy and desisted from lecturing India. Germany's strategic focus on India highlights three major themes underscoring India's rising global position. First, the changing geopolitical landscape has led Germany and the West to view India not just as an occasional ally but as a strategic partner with lasting influence. This shift is captured in Germany's recent "Focus on India" strategic document, signalling a transformation from episodic cooperation to a committed partnership. The document underlined India as a 'central and active shaper of international politics'. The West increasingly recognises India's ability to contribute strategically, reflecting a maturing relationship that is responsive, rather than reactionary, to shared global challenges. Like the United States' shift in its India policy post-1998, Germany's approach now highlights India's role as a reliable partner in areas such as economic resilience, technology, and sustainable development.</p>

<p>The Focus on India document's identification of India as a "stabilizer" in the Indo-Pacific underscores the second major theme: India's Anchor of Stability, both regionally and on broader global issues. With rising concerns about China's influence, Germany acknowledges India as essential to a free and open Indo-Pacific. Thus, recognizes the Indian commitment to safeguarding maritime security and upholding sovereignty. Chancellor Scholz's recent visit to the German frigate Baden-Wurttemberg in Goa further emphasized this stance, highlighting the alignment between Germany's Indo-Pacific vision and India's security priorities. As India and Germany strengthen their ties in the Indo-Pacific, their partnership is moving beyond transactional goals to shared principles of freedom and mutual respect for sovereignty. This reflects the fundamental shift in Germany's perspective concerning the Indo-Pacific. In 2020, the German government's <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/blob/2380514/f9784f7e3b3fa1bd7c5446d274a4169e/200901-indo-pazifik-leitlinien--1--data.pdf">Indo-Pacific policy guidelines </a>have referred to India as 'another Indo-Pacific partner'.</p>

<p>Finally, India's unique positioning as a pragmatic and reliable bridge in complex conflicts, such as the Russia-Ukraine war, is gaining international recognition. Unlike other major powers, India maintains open diplomatic channels with all stakeholders in the conflict, including the U.S., Germany, Russia, and Ukraine. The recently concluded BRICS plus summit in Kazan in Russia signalled India holds the best geopolitical position globally. Germany's acceptance of India's neutral stance highlights an understanding that independence in decision-making and focus on long-term relationships shape Indian foreign policy. Unlike China, whose interests often diverge from Western priorities, India promotes global stability without treating crises as mere transactions. This perception of India as a pragmatic yet empathetic bridge solidifies its credibility on the world stage and demonstrates its value in navigating geopolitical conflicts with sensitivity and reliability.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Together, these themes reveal a fundamental shift: Germany and the West are moving from viewing India as a regional ally to recognizing it as a strategic partner with a stabilizing and mediating influence essential to today's multipolar world.</p>

<p><strong>Limitations and Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>Germany's "Focus on India" policy marks a shift from a distant, episodic relationship with New Delhi to a steady, strategic collaboration grounded in mutual respect for sovereignty and values. However, while Germany acknowledges India's significance, the policy's cover-where Kashmir is subtly obscured on the map-hints at lingering sensitivities. Besides, the Focus on India document refers to the so-called "Global South" on three occasions. In the West, this term is often viewed dismissively. In contrast, New Delhi and over 100 capitals worldwide identify with it proudly. The disdainful tone concerning the term underlines the need for jointly traversing along the road of partnership.</p>

<p>Yet, this evolution reflects Germany's move from a Eurocentric approach to a realistic embrace of global multipolarity. By viewing India as a true partner, not merely a regional ally, Germany aligns itself with the emerging world order. This alliance offers both nations a historic opportunity to address shared challenges, drive economic growth, and enhance stability amid global shifts.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A young Chinese woman, Li, from Henan province, suffered a severe psychological breakdown after being scolded by her supervisor at work. According to <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scmp.com/news/people-culture/trending-china/article/3283564/chinese-woman-scolded-work-stops-eating-needs-reminders-use-toilet?module=latest&amp;pgtype=homepage">South China Morning Post</a></em>, Li became catatonic and stopped eating, drinking, moving, or engaging in conversation. This disturbing incident began a month prior when her team leader reprimanded her, leaving her unhappy and ultimately leading to a complete emotional and physical shutdown.</p>

<p>As Li's condition continued to deteriorate, her physical abilities also severely declined. Her family reported that if they removed the pillow from beneath her head, it would hang limply in mid-air, unable to support itself. Furthermore, she lost control over basic bodily functions, requiring constant assistance from her loved ones to remind her to use the toilet.</p>

<p>Dr. Jia Dehuan, Li's physician at Zhengzhou Eighth People's Hospital, described her condition as resembling a "wooden" figure, devoid of movement or responsiveness. According to Dr. Jia, Li was suffering from a catatonic stupor, a severe symptom of depression characterized by immobilisation, unresponsiveness, loss of motor control, and withdrawal from reality. This rare and extreme manifestation of depression is often triggered by intense emotional trauma or stress.</p>

<p>The doctor noted that&nbsp;Li had an introverted personality and struggled to open up to those around her, which ultimately contributed to her more severe condition. Under Dr. Jia's care, Li received the necessary treatment and support to recover from this critical condition.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The disturbing incident has sparked widespread concern and debate on mainland Chinese social media. Users expressed shock and sympathy for Li's ordeal and outrage over workplace bullying and stress.&nbsp;One user wrote, ''If your job is too demanding, it's better to leave rather than suffer in silence.''</p>

<p>Another commented, ''She had been torturing herself due to her boss's actions.''</p>

<p>A recent survey by the Chinese Psychological Society shed light on the alarming state of workplace mental health in China. The findings revealed that 4.8% of employees experienced workplace depression, while 80% reported feelings of agitation at work. Additionally, 60% of respondents cited anxiety, and nearly 40% exhibited symptoms of depression, according to Shangguan News (2023).&nbsp;</p>

<p>The survey's results highlight the pressing issue of workplace mental health in China, where high work demands, limited job security, poor work-life balance, and inadequate communication contribute to the problem.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On November 5, Americans will cast their votes not only for the presidency but also for 34 Senate seats, all 435 House seats, 11 governorships and thousands of state legislative positions. Among the new contenders is Ashwin Ramaswami, a young Indian American Democrat challenging Republican Senator Shawn Still in Georgia's Senate District 48, a traditionally conservative seat.</p>

<p><strong>Who is Ashwin Ramaswami?</strong></p>

<ol>
	<li aria-level="1">Ashwin Ramaswami was born to Indian immigrant parents from Tamil Nadu and grew up in Johns Creek. He is running for the Georgia State Senate in District 48, and just meets the minimum age requirement of 25, turning that age in May 2024.</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Ashwin Ramaswami studied Computer Science at Stanford University and then pursued a law degree at Georgetown University, as per his election <a href="https://ashwinforgeorgia.com/ " rel="nofollow,noindex">campaign website</a>.</li>
	<li aria-level="1">He has a strong background in cybersecurity, having <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashwin-r/ " rel="nofollow,noindex">worked with CISA</a>, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, where he helped secure local election systems from cyberattacks, and Schmidt Futures, where he conducted research on securing open-source software, which contributed to a bill in Congress. He decided to quit his job at CISA after three years to run for office after realising that the greater threat to democracy lies not just in cyberattacks but in political misinformation surrounding election integrity, reported <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/rcna144294 " rel="nofollow,noindex">NBC News</a>.</li>
	<li aria-level="1">During his studies, he taught classes on Hindu philosophy and raised $100,000 for Dharmic programmes at Georgetown, supporting students of various faiths, including Hindu, Sikh, Jain and Buddhist.</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Ashwin Ramaswami's campaign promises election security and integrity, positioning him against Shawn Still's alleged 2020 election-related activities. Shawn Still was one of the fake electors who participated in the Donald Trump fake electors plot, which aimed to award Georgia's electoral votes to Donald Trump despite him losing the state to Joe Biden. Mr Ramaswami's campaign has raised more than $700,000 in funding, which is considered a significant amount for a first-time candidate.</li>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has claimed that Google CEO Sundar Pichai called him to compliment his recent visit to McDonald's.&nbsp;“I did McDonald's last week and I actually got a call from Sundar (Pichai),” Donald Trump said during an appearance on the Joe Rogan podcast. “He said, ‘This is the biggest thing we've had in years.'”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Trump continued, “Sundar, who's a great guy by the way, said, ‘This McDonald's thing, I want to tell you, it's one of the biggest things we've ever had on Google. It just hit.'”</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-media-max-width="560">

<p>The <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/donald-trump-turns-chef-at-mcdonalds-ahead-of-us-presidential-elections-2024-says-worked-more-than-kamala-harris-6835696">former president's visit to McDonald's</a> in Pennsylvania was not merely a campaign stop but a strategic move, aimed at undermining his opponent Vice President Kamala Harris. He quipped that he had now worked “15 minutes more than her” at the fast-food chain, referring to her previous comments about her own experience working there when she was young.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“She lied about McDonald's,” Trump declared. “I've worked here for 15 minutes, which is 15 minutes more than she worked here. Has that proven that she never worked at McDonald's? Well, McDonald's has no information. No, she has no information. She's nobody. The manager said she'd never worked there,” he added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This comes after Trump alleged that Google obscured results for people attempting to find information about him. He has previously said that he reached out to CEO Sundar Pichai to voice his complaints regarding the perceived bias in search results.</p>

<p>At an event organised by the <a href="http://https://www.newsweek.com/trump-called-google-ceo-couldnt-find-good-stories-about-himself-1969781 " rel="nofollow,noindex">Economic Club of Chicago</a> on October 15, Trump told John Micklethwait, editor-in-chief of Bloomberg News, that he had recently contacted the “head of Google” to voice his concerns over the search results associated with his name.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“I'm getting a lot of good stories lately, but you don't find them in Google,” Trump said he told Pichai. “I think it's a whole rigged deal. I think Google's rigged just like our government is rigged.” “They only have bad stories. In other words, if I have 20 good stories and 20 bad stories, and everyone's entitled to that, you'll only see the 20 bad stories,” he told Micklethwait.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rescuers in the Philippines were diving into a lake and scouring isolated villages on Sunday to locate dozens of missing people as the death count from Tropical Storm Trami hit 100.</p>

<p>Trami, which rammed into the Philippines on October 24, was among the deadliest storms to hit the Southeast Asian country this year.</p>

<p>According to the national disaster agency, it forced more than half a million people to flee their homes and at least 36 people remain missing.</p>

<p>Police in the hardest-hit Bicol region have recorded 38 deaths, most due to drowning.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We are still receiving many calls and we are trying to save as many people as we can," Bicol regional police director Andre Dizon told AFP.</p>

<p>"Hopefully, there will be no more deaths."</p>

<p>Dizon added that "many residents" in the region's Camarines Sur province are still trapped on roofs and the upper floors of their homes. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The death count in Batangas, south of Manila, has risen to 55, provincial police chief Jacinto Malinao told AFP.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Two were reported dead in separate incidents of electrocution and drowning in Cavite province, police said.</p>

<p>Five more bodies were recovered in other provinces, bringing the total to 100, according to an AFP tally based on official police and disaster agency sources.</p>

<p>"A higher death toll is possible in the coming days since rescuers can now reach previously isolated places," Edgar Posadas of the Civil Defence Office told AFP.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The police, coast guards and a Marines diving team were searching on Sunday for a family of seven at Taal Lake in Batangas.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The waters from the mountains hit their home in Balete town, causing it to be swept away with them possibly inside," Malinao, the provincial police chief, said.</p>

<p>Most of the deaths in Batangas have been attributed to rain-induced landslides.&nbsp;</p>

<p>More than 20 bodies were pulled from heaps of mud, boulders and fallen trees, while police said at least another 20 people in the province are still missing.</p>

<p>"We will continue searching until all bodies are retrieved," Malinao said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The national disaster agency said Sunday that about 560,000 people had been displaced by floods, which submerged hundreds of villages in swaths of the northern Philippines.</p>

<p>About 20 big storms and typhoons hit the archipelago nation or its surrounding waters each year, damaging homes and infrastructure and killing dozens of people.</p>

<p>A recent study showed that storms in the Asia-Pacific region are increasingly forming closer to coastlines, intensifying more rapidly and lasting longer over land due to climate change.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Nima Rinji Sherpa became the youngest climber to reach all 14 of the world’s tallest mountains, known as the “eight-thousanders.”]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At just 18 years old, Nepal's Nima Rinji Sherpa has achieved a milestone few have accomplished, becoming the youngest climber to reach all 14 of the world's tallest mountains, known as the "eight-thousanders." Mr Rinji's journey culminated on October 9 with the summit of Shishapangma, Nepal's 8,027-metre peak, alongside climbing partner Pasang Nurbu Sherpa.</p>

<p>Reflecting on his latest feat, Mr Rinji described reaching the summit as "pure joy." His passion, he said, is inspired by his family, a lineage of accomplished mountaineers, including his father, Tashi Lakpa Sherpa, and uncle, Mingma Sherpa, both renowned in Nepal's climbing community.</p>

<p>"My uncles and my father... came from a very small village. To even dream about being this successful, for them it was really hard," he told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/10/26/travel/nima-rinji-sherpa-mountaineering-legacy-intl-hnk/index.html">CNN</a>. "I have the privilege that they didn't have."</p>

<p>Mr Rinji's next goal is equally daring: a winter ascent of Manaslu without supplemental oxygen or fixed ropes, in collaboration with Italian climber Simone Moro. "That means we're climbing an 8,000-metre mountain in winter... there is no support for us. So, it's like pure human endurance," he said. "It has never been done in the history of mountaineering."</p>

<p>This recent accomplishment did not attract major sponsors; he relied on his father's 14 Peaks Expedition for funding. Despite the lack of support, he remains hopeful about inspiring young Sherpa climbers. "Hopefully I become the face of a big brand," he said, adding that he hopes to redefine the perception of Sherpa climbers as "support staff" only.</p>

<p>Over the past two years, Mr Rinji has tackled Everest, K2, and five peaks in less than five weeks. Among his climbs, Annapurna remains a personal favourite. "For a teenager of 17 years to do something without using oxygen, you know, normally it's not recommended," he said, recalling the challenges he faced.</p>

<p>Summiting the eight-thousanders requires navigating the perilous "death zone," where oxygen levels are critically low and temperatures are extreme. Nima Rinji noted the harsh reality of life at such altitudes: "Your body starts to shut down... Maybe I like suffering," he joked.</p>

<p>Mr Rinji envisions a sustainable future for Nepal's mountaineering industry and hopes his achievements will inspire a new generation of Nepali climbers. "Hopefully, the younger generation... we will try to mobilise this industry and make it more sustainable for the upcoming generations," he said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

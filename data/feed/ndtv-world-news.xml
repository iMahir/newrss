       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A major French Jewish group on Sunday slammed a hard-left MP for saying Israeli athletes were not welcome at the Paris Olympics from next week because of the war in Gaza, calling the comments "irresponsible".</p>

<p>France Unbowed (LFI) lawmaker Thomas Portes was "putting a target on the backs of Israeli athletes," said Yonathan Arfi, head of the Representative Council of Jewish Institutions in France, on X.</p>

<p>Portes had said at a rally in support of Palestinians that "the Israeli delegation is not welcome in Paris. Israeli sportspeople are not welcome at the Paris Olympic Games" and called for "mobilisation" around the event.</p>

<p>He later told the Parisien newspaper that "France's diplomats should pressure the International Olympic Committee to bar the Israeli flag and anthem, as is done for Russia".</p>

<p>"It's time to end the double standard," Portes added.</p>

<p>Opposition to Israel's campaign in Gaza was a centrepiece of LFI's campaign ahead of European elections last month.</p>

<p>The territory's Hamas-run health ministry said Sunday that almost 39,000 people had been killed in the fighting, which was sparked by the bloody October 7 attacks by Hamas.</p>

<p>Perceived ambiguity in LFI's response to the October massacre broke apart an alliance of left-wing parties, which grudgingly reformed for this month's parliamentary polls but has since struggled to find common ground despite coming first.</p>

<p>Crif head Arfi said Israeli athletes were "already the most in danger at the Olympic Games", recalling the 11 "murdered by Palestinian terrorists" in 1972 at the Munich Games.</p>

<p>Beyond the Jewish group, Portes also came under attack from nominal parliamentary allies in the Socialist party and conservatives.</p>

<p>"Of course Israeli athletes are welcome, like all sportspeople from all over the world. Not for who they are but for what they do," Socialist MP Jerome Guedj posted.</p>

<p>Some LFI lawmakers came out in support of Portes.</p>

<p>"The Israeli flag, stained with the blood of Gaza's innocents, should not fly in Paris this summer," MP Aymeric Caron wrote.</p>

<p>Israel's football team is set to play its first Olympic match against Mali in Paris' Parc des Prince stadium on Wednesday, two days before the opening ceremony.</p>

<p>Israeli President Isaac Herzog's office said Sunday that he would attend Friday's boat parade on the river Seine and a commemoration for the Israelis killed in Munich in 1972.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Bangladesh's Supreme Court on Sunday scrapped most of the quotas on government jobs that had sparked nationwide protests by students that have killed at least 139 people in recent days.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bangladesh's Supreme Court on Sunday scrapped most of the quotas on government jobs that had sparked nationwide protests by students that have killed at least 139 people in recent days.</p>

<p>Here are details of the protests and their history:</p>

<p><strong>WHAT TRIGGERED THE PROTESTS?</strong></p>

<p>The demonstrations started last month after the High Court reinstated a quota system for government jobs, overturning a 2018 decision by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's government to scrap it.</p>

<p>That move, which covered the 30% of jobs reserved for family members of freedom fighters in the 1971 war for independence from Pakistan, followed similar student protests.</p>

<p>But the Supreme Court suspended the high court order after the government's appeal. On Sunday it dismissed the lower court order and directed that 93% of jobs should be open to candidates on merit.</p>

<p>The court reserved 5% of jobs for family members of independence fighters and 2% for people from so-called backward groups and the disabled.</p>

<p>The students had stepped up their protest when Hasina refused to meet their demands, citing the court proceedings.</p>

<p>She called the protesters "razakar", an offensive term for those accused of collaborating with Pakistan's army in 1971 to betray the country.</p>

<p><strong>WHAT IS THE QUOTA SYSTEM?</strong></p>

<p>Introduced in 1972, Bangladesh's quota system has gone through several changes since. When it was abolished in 2018, 56% of government jobs were blocked under various quotas.</p>

<p>The bulk covered groups such as freedom fighters' families, with women and those from underdeveloped districts receiving a share of a tenth each, with 5% allotted to indigenous communities, and 1% for the disabled.</p>

<p>The protesting students want all categories abolished, except the last two.</p>

<p><strong>WHAT SPARKED THE VIOLENCE?</strong></p>

<p>The protests turned violent last week following clashes between thousands of anti-quota demonstrators and members of the student wing of Hasina's Awami League party. Police fired rubber bullets and hurled sound grenades and tear gas to scatter protesters who also blocked railway tracks and major roads.</p>

<p><strong>WHAT DO THE STUDENTS FEAR?</strong></p>

<p>Hasina is the daughter of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the founding father of Bangladesh, who led its freedom movement. Protesters and critics say the 30% quota for families of freedom fighters favours Awami League supporters, which led the independence fight.</p>

<p>Experts also attribute the unrest to stagnant job growth in the private sector, making public sector jobs, with their accompanying regular wage hikes and privileges, very attractive.</p>

<p>The quotas shrink the number of government jobs open for all, hurting aspirants who want them filled on the basis of merit.</p>

<p>They have sparked anger among students grappling with high youth unemployment, as nearly 32 million young people are out of work or education in a population of 170 million.</p>

<p>The economy, once among the world's fastest-growing, has stagnated, inflation hovers around 10% and dollar reserves are shrinking.</p>

<p><strong>WHAT HAS HASINA SAID?</strong></p>

<p>The protests are the first challenge to Hasina's government since she won a fourth consecutive term in January in elections boycotted by the main opposition. She has condemned the loss of lives and called for patience ahead of the Supreme Court's verdict.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pakistan's jailed former premier Imran Khan has claimed that he is being caged like a "terrorist", and was denied basic prisoner and human rights in a "death cell" at a high-security jail.</p>

<p>The 71-year-old Pakistan-Tehreek-e-Insaf party founder made these claims in a rare interview from behind bars with British publication 'The Sunday Times', the Dawn newspaper reported on Sunday.</p>

<p>"I am confined in a 7ft by 8ft death cell, typically reserved for terrorists to ensure they have no contact with anyone," he told the newspaper.</p>

<p>"It is solitary confinement with barely any space to move. I am under constant surveillance by the agencies, being recorded 24/7, and I am denied basic prisoner and human rights such as visitation," he said.</p>

<p>The interview was conducted via his lawyers, as - according to the article - he is not allowed a pencil and paper.</p>

<p>Imran Khan has been imprisoned at the high-security Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi for almost a year upon his conviction in three cases - the Toshakhana corruption case, the cipher case, and the un-Islamic marriage case -- in which his wife, Bushra Bibi, is also jailed.</p>

<p>He faces over 200 cases and has been convicted in a few of them.</p>

<p>Though the former-cricketer-turned-politician had secured bail or his conviction was set aside, he has not been released.</p>

<p>Imran Khan was arrested on August 5 last year after his conviction in the first Toshakhana corruption case filed by the Election Commission of Pakistan.</p>

<p>Since then, he has been kept in jail in various cases.</p>

<p>After setting aside Imran Khan's conviction in the Iddat (un-Islamic marriage) case earlier this month, the court ruled that he should be released from jail if he is not wanted in another case.</p>

<p>But within hours, he was arrested in another Toshakhana case along with his 49-year-old wife Bushra, and both are still in jail.</p>

<p>He frequently alleges about not being treated well in jail, but authorities so far have been rejecting his claims and allegations.</p>

<p>Responding to reports about Imran Khan's imprisonment conditions, Information Minister Atta Tarar denied he was being held in a death row cell.</p>

<p>"The Sharif family endured harsh conditions, but Imran Khan enjoys presidential suites at Adiala Jail, with access to a gym, kitchen, walking gallery, and luxurious meals," he said at a press conference.</p>

<p>On Saturday, Imran Khan's wife, Bushra also expressed grave concerns about her husband's safety in the Adiala Jail, alleging that he was kept in inhumane conditions and given contaminated food.</p>

<p>According to Bushra, Imran Khan's life is in danger, keeping in view the past incidents where he was allegedly poisoned and shot at.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Israel said it shot down a missile launched from Yemen on Sunday and the Yemeni Houthi movement said it had fired several missiles at the Israeli city of Eilat after Israel's first public strike against the Iran-aligned group a day earlier.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel said it shot down a missile launched from Yemen on Sunday and the Yemeni Houthi movement said it had fired several missiles at the Israeli city of Eilat after Israel's first public strike against the Iran-aligned group a day earlier.</p>

<p>The Houthis have launched missiles and drones at Israel and disrupted global trade through the Red Sea in response to Israel's assault on Gaza, further destabilising the Middle East as war in the Palestinian enclave rages on after nine months.</p>

<p>Israel says the Houthis have launched 200 attacks against it since the Gaza war began, many of them intercepted and most of them not deadly.</p>

<p>But a rare Houthi drone strike on Friday hit Tel Aviv and killed one person, prompting Israel to announce its first strikes against the group on Saturday. The strikes by warplanes hit near the Yemeni port of Hodeidah and killed six people, local medics said.</p>

<p>The Houthi movement, known formally as Ansar Allah, said on Sunday it would continue to attack Israel in response.</p>

<p>Houthi spokesperson Mohammed Abdulsalam told Qatar's Al Jazeera TV there would be "no red lines ... all sensitive institutions ... will be a target for us."</p>

<p>The Israeli military said its Arrow 3 missile defence system had shot down a surface-to-surface missile projectile launched from Yemen on Sunday before it crossed into Israeli territory.</p>

<p>Before the interception, air raid sirens sounded in the Red Sea port city of Eilat, sending residents running for shelter.</p>

<p>Sunday's attack prolonged an escalation of violence between Israel and the Houthis that began with the Houthi drone strike that hit the centre of Tel Aviv on Friday. One man was killed and four other people were wounded, officials said.</p>

<p>The Israeli warplanes' air raid on Hodeidah on Saturday killed six people and wounded more than 80, medical sources in Yemen told Reuters, describing all as civilians.</p>

<p>Images from the scene showed a fiery blaze and dense smoke rising from the site of the strike. A Houthi-run TV channel said the strikes had hit an oil facility and power station.</p>

<p>Israeli officials say Hodeidah port has been used by the Houthis to receive weapons shipments from Iran.</p>

<p>PROXY BATTLE</p>

<p>The exchanges are part of a spillover from the Gaza war that has drawn in regional and world powers.</p>

<p>Iran-aligned groups including the Houthis have fired rockets and missiles at Israel saying they are doing so in support of Palestinians and the Islamist militant group Hamas that governs Gaza. The United States and its allies back Israel and provide weapons to it.</p>

<p>The war began on Oct. 7 after a Hamas-led attack on southern Israel in which about 1,200 people were killed and over 250 taken hostage back to Gaza, according to Israeli authorities.</p>

<p>Israel has since bombed and invaded Gaza as part of what it says is a campaign to eliminate Hamas, killing nearly 39,000 people, according to health officials in the enclave.</p>

<p>The Houthis, who control much of the north of Yemen and other large population centres, have previously claimed targeting Eilat and other attacks directed at Israel, saying they are acting in retaliation for Israel's war on Gaza.</p>

<p>The group has also attacked Red Sea shipping routes for months.</p>

<p>Hamas' allies include Iran-backed groups such as the Houthis, Hezbollah in Lebanon and Iraqi paramilitaries.</p>

<p>The Houthi movement consists primarily of members a minority Shi'ite Muslim group in Yemen and has controlled the country's capital, Sanaa, for years.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is no tangible evidence of India deepening its military and technology relationship with Russia, US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan has said, asserting that Moscow, which has become a "junior partner" to China, is not necessarily going to be a "great and reliable friend" to India in a future contingency.</p>

<p>Mr Sullivan made remarks at the Aspen Security Forum in Colorado while responding to questions about the recent visit of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Russia for bilateral talks with President Vladimir Putin.</p>

<p>"I think the biggest question is: Do we see tangible evidence that India is deepening its military and technology relationship with Russia? And I did not see tangible evidence out of that visit that it was deepening; I didn't see deliverables in that space," Mr Sullivan said.</p>

<p>"How concerned were you when Prime Minister Modi met President Putin, essentially at the same time that President Joe Biden was hosting the NATO leaders in Washington?" he was asked.</p>

<p>"Don't you think the bear hug was significant then?" he was asked. "Well, Modi has a certain way, of course, of greeting world leaders. I've seen it up close and personal, actually,'' Mr Sullivan said.</p>

<p>The Biden Administration, he said, never wants to see countries that the US cares about, who are its partners and friends, show up in Moscow and hug Putin. "Of course, we don't. I'm not going to sit here and tell people otherwise," he said.</p>

<p>''But in terms of our relationship with India, you know, we see enormous opportunities in technology, in economics, and in the statecraft and geopolitics of the wider Indo-Pacific region. And we want to deepen that relationship as equals, as two sovereign countries who also have relationships with other countries. And India has a historic relationship with Russia that they're not going to cut off,'' Mr Sullivan said.</p>

<p>"But we do believe that we want to continue to have a deep dialogue with India about the specifics and the nature of that relationship and whether it evolves, particularly, Demetri, because Russia is getting closer and closer to China, and as the junior partner to China, is not necessarily going to be a great and reliable friend to India in a future contingency or crisis."</p>

<p>"That's not something India needs to hear from Jake Sullivan, but it is a fact in the world. And it's something that we take into account as we have our strategic dialogue with India,'' said the US National Security Advisor, who was in New Delhi last month and met Prime Minister Modi and his counterpart Ajit Doval.</p>

<p>Mr Ajit Doval and Mr Sullivan also held a telephone conversation on July 12, days after PM Modi visited Russia.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Democratic party will be taking a historic gamble if it turns to Vice President Kamala Harris to become its presidential candidate, betting that a Black woman can overcome racism, sexism and her own missteps as a politician to defeat Republican Donald Trump.</p>

<p>In more than two centuries of democracy, American voters have elected only one Black president and never a woman, a record that makes even some Black voters wonder if Harris can crash through the hardest ceiling in US politics.</p>

<p>"Will her race and gender be an issue? Absolutely," said LaTosha Brown, a political strategist and co-founder of the Black Lives Matter Fund.</p>

<p>Harris would face other big challenges: if promoted to the top of the ticket, she would have barely three months to campaign and unite the party and donors behind her.</p>

<p>Yet many Democrats are excited about her chances.</p>

<p>Some three dozen Democratic lawmakers have voiced fears that President Joe Biden, 81, will lose an election that the party has cast as a battle for the future of US democracy because he lacks the mental and physical stamina to win and serve four more years.</p>

<p>Many fear Trump and the Republicans could not only take the White House, but both houses of Congress.</p>

<p>Biden said again on Friday that he would not step aside and would resume campaigning after he recovers from COVID-19. Harris pressed the case for his re-election on Saturday at a fundraiser.</p>

<p>Harris, 59, is two decades younger than Trump and a leader in the party on abortion rights, an issue which resonates with younger voters and Democrats' progressive base. Proponents argue she would energize those voters, consolidate Black support, and bring sharp debating skills to prosecute the political case against the former president.</p>

<p>Her candidacy would offer a contrast with Trump and his vice presidential running mate, Senator J.D. Vance, the two white men on the Republican ticket, Brown said.</p>

<p>"That to me is reflective of America's past. She is reflective of America's now and future," Brown said.</p>

<p>But despite earning praise in the last few weeks for her strong defense of Biden, some Democrats remain concerned about Harris' shaky first two years in office, short-lived campaign for the 2020 Democratic nomination, and - perhaps most of all - the weight of a long history of racial and gender discrimination in the United States.</p>

<p>In a hypothetical head-to-head matchup, Harris and Trump were tied with 44% support each in a July 15-16 Reuters/Ipsos poll, conducted immediately after the assassination attempt against Trump. Trump led Biden 43% to 41% in that same poll, though the 2 percentage point difference was within the poll's 3 percentage point margin of error.</p>

<p>Harris's approval ratings, while low, are a tick higher than Biden's. According to polling outfit Five Thirty Eight, 38.6 percent of Americans approve of Harris while 50.4 percent disapprove. Biden has 38.5 percent approval and 56.2 percent disapproval.</p>

<p>'NO SAFE OPTION'</p>

<p>"If you think that there is consensus among the people who want Joe Biden to leave that they will support Kamala - Vice President Harris - you would be mistaken," Representative Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez, a Biden supporter, said on Instagram. "There's no safe option."</p>

<p>The United States elected Barack Obama, the first and only Black president in 2008. The only woman to head a presidential ticket of a major party, Hillary Clinton, lost to Trump in 2016.</p>

<p>Supporters of Harris, the first woman and first Black and South Asian person to serve as vice president, argue she has already weathered unfair attacks related to her race and gender and is prepared for more.</p>

<p>"America has a history of racism, sexism, so I'm sure that will factor into this conversation, factor into her campaign," said Jamal Simmons, a former Harris aide.</p>

<p>But he said there is a flip side: Black voters could be galvanized if Harris is put at the top of the ticket, and women, including some who regret not voting for Clinton in 2016, would back her as well.</p>

<p>"It's also true that she will benefit from her race and her gender, that many African Americans may rally to her candidacy," he said.</p>

<p>Harris benefits from greater name recognition than the other Democratic leaders who have been floated as potential presidential candidates, he said. California Governor Gavin Newsom and Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer are among those talked about in Democratic circles as possible replacements.</p>

<p>"While she has flaws and faults like everyone, we know those flaws and faults, so you can build a campaign with clarity. Any other candidates are complete unknowns," Simmons said.</p>

<p>One former Democratic lawmaker, speaking on condition of anonymity, said he thought Harris was a bigger risk because of her record than her race.</p>

<p>Harris was plagued by staff turnover at the beginning of her vice presidency and showed little progress on her portfolios of protecting voting rights and stemming migration from Central America.</p>

<p>"I think the race thing is just a compounding factor or an exacerbating factor," the former lawmaker said. "Any of it's going to be a gamble, but I like the odds with another candidate, even if that means Kamala at the top of the ticket."</p>

<p>'PATRIARCHY IS A HELL OF A DRUG'</p>

<p>Trump has used racist and sexist language, explicitly and in code. In 2020 he said he had "heard" Harris, a US citizen born in California, did not qualify to be a candidate for vice president.</p>

<p>At a rally in Michigan on Saturday, Trump piled on Harris for the way she laughs.</p>

<p>"I call her Laughing Kamala," Trump said. "You ever watch her laugh? She's crazy."</p>

<p>Trump's campaign said Democrats were deploying "classic disinformation" about his language and noted Harris's dispute with Biden in a 2019 debate about school busing and her criticism of Biden for working with segregationists in the Senate.</p>

<p>"In contrast, President Trump is polling at record-high levels with African Americans," Trump campaign senior adviser Jason Miller said in a statement.</p>

<p>Trump made false "birtherism" claims against Obama, who was born in Hawaii. Those falsehoods gained traction among far-right activists and his nationalist base, prompting an exasperated Obama, blasting "carnival barkers," to release a longer version of his birth certificate from the White House.</p>

<p>Polling at the time showed a quarter of all Americans - and 45 percent of Republicans - believed Obama had not been born in the country.</p>

<p>"You've got birtherism 2.0," said Cliff Albright, co-founder and CEO of Black Voters Matter Fund, an Atlanta-based non-profit, referring to Harris.</p>

<p>Nadia Brown, director of the women's and gender studies program at Georgetown University, said despite the rise of Black political leaders, there remains a notable reluctance to accept women in key leadership roles.</p>

<p>"Patriarchy is a hell of a drug," Brown said. "With racism, we know it, we can call it out. The mood that we're not seeing as articulately expressed is a real reticence to have a Black woman in particular as a leader."</p>

<p>Harris's standing in the party has improved with her aggressive advocacy for reproductive rights after the Supreme Court in 2022 struck down Roe v Wade, which protected women's right to abortion.</p>

<p>Biden credited her with helping to prevent a "red wave" of Republican victories in that year's midterm elections, and Harris has crisscrossed the country as a top campaign spokesperson on abortion rights.</p>

<p>Harris could also inherit Biden's strong support among Black voters, who helped propel him to the 2020 Democratic nomination.</p>

<p>But Black women have not entirely given up on Biden.</p>

<p>Donna Brazile, a political strategist and former chair of the Democratic National Committee, said on Friday she had joined 1,400 Black women in a letter of support for a Biden-Harris ticket and in condemnation of disunity within the party.</p>

<p>And if the party ends up coalescing around Harris, she could receive some of the blame from voters who say Democratic leaders covered up his frailties.</p>

<p>"I'm kind of done with the Democrats. So many knew about Biden's condition and hid it. Kamala was part of that," said Gina Gannon, 65, a retiree in the battleground state of Georgia, who voted for Trump in 2016 and Biden in 2020.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lebanon's Hezbollah on Sunday said it fired Katyusha rockets at northern Israel in response to an overnight Israeli strike that, according to state media, hit a weapons depot and wounded six people.</p>

<p>Hezbollah has traded near-daily cross-border fire with Israeli forces in support of Hamas since the Palestinian militant group's October 7 attack on southern Israel triggered war in the Gaza Strip.</p>

<p>The Iran-backed Hezbollah said it targeted northern Israel's Dafna area with Katyusha rockets "in response to the Israeli enemy's attacks that targeted civilians in the town of Adloun, injuring several of them".</p>

<p>This comes after the Israeli military said its air force "struck two Hezbollah weapons storage facilities in southern Lebanon, containing rockets and additional weaponry".</p>

<p>Late on Saturday, Lebanon's state-run National News Agency said "the Israeli enemy launched a raid" on the town of Adloun, about 30 kilometres (19 miles) from the border with Israel, later saying the target was "an ammunition depot".</p>

<p>"Six civilians sustained moderate injuries," the NNA said on Sunday, revising the figure up from three the night before.</p>

<p>Rockets were still exploding about an hour after the strike was first reported, the NNA said, with videos circulating online showing several large explosions in Adloun.</p>

<p>"Shrapnel from the explosions flew to surrounding villages," the NNA said.</p>

<p>Hezbollah on Sunday said in separate statements that three of its fighters were killed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Earlier on Saturday, Hezbollah and its Palestinian ally Hamas had fired rocket salvos and explosive-laden drones at Israeli positions.</p>

<p>Hezbollah said it had launched "dozens of Katyusha rockets" towards northern Israel "in response" to a strike blamed on Israel that injured civilians.</p>

<p>Hamas's armed wing, the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades, said they also fired a rocket salvo from south Lebanon towards an Israeli military position in the Upper Galilee.</p>

<p>The violence since October has killed at least 518 people in Lebanon, according to an AFP tally. Most of the dead have been fighters, but they have included at least 104 civilians.</p>

<p>On the Israeli side, 18 soldiers and 13 civilians have been killed, according to Israeli authorities.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yemen's Houthi rebels promised a "huge" retaliation against Israel on Sunday following a deadly strike on the port of Hodeida, as violence sparked by the Gaza war gripped the region.</p>

<p>Israel bombed the Palestinian territory, Lebanon and Yemen in quick succession this week in response to attacks from Iran-backed militant groups.</p>

<p>Despite Washington asserting that a deal to end more than nine months of devastating war between Israel and Gaza rulers Hamas was near the "goal line", the Israeli military said it intercepted a missile fired from Yemen as it pressed on with its offensive in the besieged Gaza Strip.</p>

<p>Dozens have been killed since Saturday across Gaza, the civil defence agency said, including in strikes on homes in the central Nuseirat and Bureij areas and displaced people near southern Khan Yunis.</p>

<p>Residents said a major operation was underway in the Saudi district west of Rafah in the south, reporting heavy artillery and clashes.</p>

<p>The deadly strikes in Gaza came hours after Hezbollah and its ally Hamas said they fired at Israeli positions from south Lebanon, while Yemen's Houthi rebels vowed to respond to Israeli warplanes hitting a key port.</p>

<p>On Sunday, Houthi military spokesperson Yahya Saree said the rebel's &nbsp;"response to the Israeli aggression against our country is inevitably coming and will be huge."</p>

<h2>Fire still raging</h2>

<p>The fire left raging by the strikes on rebel-held Hodeida port "is seen across the Middle East and the significance is clear," Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said on Saturday.</p>

<p>The Houthis control swathes of Yemen, including much of its Red Sea coast, while the internationally recognised government has withdrawn to Aden on the south coast.</p>

<p>Detailing the first strikes claimed by Israel in Yemen, Gallant warned of further operations if the Houthis "dare to attack us" after a rebel drone strike killed one in Tel Aviv on Friday.</p>

<p>In Hodeida, three people were killed and 87 wounded, health officials said in a statement carried by Houthi media.</p>

<p>Firefighters struggled to contain the massive blaze caused by the strike on Hodeida, with a port employee saying fuel storage tanks and a power plant were still on fire on Sunday.</p>

<p>Following the strikes, the Israeli military said on Sunday it had intercepted a missile fired from Yemen towards the Red Sea resort town of Eilat. Saree said the rebels had fired ballistic missiles towards the port city.</p>

<h2>Netanyahu travels to Washington</h2>

<p>The trio of militant groups has vowed to keep up attacks on Israel until a truce ends the violence in Gaza, which lies in ruins, with most residents forced to flee their homes.</p>

<p>The Gaza war was triggered by Hamas's October 7 attack on southern Israel, which resulted in the deaths of 1,195 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.</p>

<p>The militants also seized 251 hostages, 116 of whom are still in Gaza, including 42 the Israeli military says are dead.</p>

<p>Israel's military retaliation to wipe out Hamas has killed at least 38,983 people, also mostly civilians, according to data from the health ministry in Hamas-ruled Gaza.</p>

<p>The war has also unleashed hunger and health crises in Gaza, with Israel and the United Nations trading blame for vital aid supplies failing to reach those in need.</p>

<p>After the detection of poliovirus in Gaza sewage, though no individual cases, the World Health Organization said there were "monumental" constraints to mounting a timely response.</p>

<p>WHO spokesman Christian Lindmeier said Friday the agency believes many more diseases are "spreading out of control" inside Gaza.</p>

<p>The months-long war has also brought Israelis to the streets, sometimes in their tens of thousands, focused on securing the release of the remaining hostages.</p>

<p>"Bring them home," demonstrator Ofira Azrieli said Saturday in Tel Aviv, appealing to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.</p>

<p>The premier is due to address US lawmakers Wednesday in Washington, where he will be under pressure to reach a ceasefire with Hamas.</p>

<p>His office announced that he will meet US President Joe Biden on Tuesday.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Donald Trump also asserted in his speech that although while in office, he "stopped the missile launches from North Korea" but the country is now "acting up again."]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former United States President Donald Trump recently said that Kim Jong Un, leader of North Korea, wants him to win the 2024 Presidential race to the White House. He remarked this during the final night of the Republican National Convention (RNC) in Milwaukee. "But when we get back (in the White House), I get along with him," Mr Trump said, as per a report in <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-kim-jong-un-election-north-korea-1927825"><em>Newsweek</em></a>.</p>

<p>"He'd like to see me back, too. I think he misses me if you wanna know the truth," he added. Citing his interactions with North Korean leader and Russia's Vladimir Putin, he positioned himself as the ideal candidate to handle geopolitical problems involving North Korea and Russia and put an end to conflicts.</p>

<p>He also asserted in his speech that although while in office, he "stopped the missile launches from North Korea" but the country is now "acting up again."</p>

<p>During his presidency, Mr Trump made frequent references to Kim Jong Un as "Little Rocket Man," a nickname that highlighted Kim's ambitions for nuclear weapons and missile testing. Even while there was initially hostility and heated confrontations, Mr Trump eventually adopted a more diplomatic stance.</p>

<p>In 2018, following up on his 'Rocket Man' comment, Donald Trump reportedly <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/donald-trump-says-he-removed-south-korea-sticker-from-cd-he-gave-to-kim-jong-un-3969963">sent a signed CD of Elton John's 'Rocket Man' </a>song with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who was on a visit to North Korea for advancing denuclearisation talks with Kim Jong-un and putting a timeline on the denuclearisation process.</p>

<p>Speaking on the 'Full Send Podcast', Mr Trump stated that the gag gift for Mr Kim worked to steer the relationship between North and South Korea in a positive direction. "I asked him, 'Did you ever hear of the song Rocket Man?' when I was with him. He said, 'No, no, no,'" Mr Trump recalled. "Did you ever hear about Elton John? 'No, no, no.' I actually handed him the song 'Rocket Man,' which is a pretty good song by Elton John." he added.</p>

<p>"I gave him a tape ...I didn't show that it was made in South Korea, frankly. That the record - it said 'South Korea.' I said, 'Take that off.' We had it chiseled off," Mr Trump joked.</p>

<p>The CD then paved the way for his controversial 2019 meeting with the dictator. The meeting made Donald Trump the first sitting US President to cross into North Korea.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in the podcast, Mr Trump also called Kim Jong-un a "smart, cunning and ruthless person". "But I got to know him very well," he said, as per Newsweek. "And I think we would have had a nuclear war, had Obama been able to stay or had crooked Hillary Clinton become president, you would have had a nuclear war with North Korea," Mr Trump added.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Microsoft, the US-based tech giant, estimated that 8.5 million computers worldwide were affected due to the outage. The tech glitch happened on July 19 after Crowdstrike, a cybersecurity software company, rolled out its routine update.&nbsp;</p>

<p>From airlines to news channels, the glitch led to the crashing of IT systems, disrupting the daily proceedings.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2024/07/20/helping-our-customers-through-the-crowdstrike-outage/">blog</a> post, Microsoft stated, "We currently estimate that CrowdStrike's update affected 8.5 million Windows devices. Deploying hundreds of Microsoft engineers and experts to work directly with customers to restore services.”</p>

<p><b>Why the home PCs weren't affected?</b></p>

<p>CrowdStrike's products are predominantly used by major organisations needing robust cyber attack protection and are rarely found on home PCs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.kshb.com/news/local-news/cybersecurity-expert-says-home-computers-should-be-safe-from-crowdstrike-outage">KSHB Kansas City.com</a>, IT manager Nicole Burres said, “As far as I know, it's not something that you would need to be concerned about at home.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ms Burres, who works with Loquient Technology Services, added, “Now, it could impact your banking, it could impact some emergency services depending on your location.”</p>

<p>Taking about how CrowdStrike works and who are its clients, Ms Burres added, “CrowdStrike is a cybersecurity company that deploys cloud solutions to companies. They have about 1,000-user minimum licencing requirements, so your end user at home wouldn't be using it.”</p>

<p><b>CrowdStrike's first statement after the glitch</b></p>

<p>Addressing the glitch, Crowdstrike CEO George Kurtz <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/fix-deployed-ceo-of-firm-behind-global-microsoft-outage-6140433">said</a>, "CrowdStrike is actively working with customers impacted by a defect found in a single content update for Windows hosts. Mac and Linux hosts are not impacted. This is not a security incident or cyberattack. The issue has been identified, isolated and a fix has been deployed. We refer customers to the support portal for the latest updates and will continue to provide complete and continuous updates on our website. We further recommend organizations ensure they're communicating with CrowdStrike representatives through official channels. Our team is fully mobilized to ensure the security and stability of CrowdStrike customers.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee today said that the state would offer shelter to anyone in distress who knocks on their door. Her remarks come amid violent protests in Bangladesh that have already resulted in the death of 151 people. What began as a protest against politicised admission quotas for sought-after government jobs snowballed this week into some of the worst unrest of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's tenure.</p>

<p>Ms Banerjee said that though she did not have the power to speak on the affairs of Bangladesh, and even India's official stand would be taken by the Centre, she would help those in distress who seek help from Bengal.</p>

<p>She referred to the United Nations Resolution on refugees as justification for her stand over the possible humanitarian crisis.</p>

<p>"I should not be speaking on the affairs of Bangladesh since it's another country. Whatever needs to be said on the issue is a subject matter of the Centre. But I only can say, if helpless people knock on Bengal's doors, we will shelter them," the Trinamool Congress chief said at the 'Martyrs Day' rally in Kolkata.</p>

<p>"That's because there is a United Nations Resolution to accommodate refugees in regions adjacent to those under turmoil," Ms Banerjee added while drawing an example from Assamese people who were allowed to live in the Alipurduars area of north Bengal for a considerable period during the Bodo strife in the northeastern state.</p>

<p>Mamata Banerjee also expressed her solidarity with the people who have remained at the receiving end of the ongoing violence in the neighbouring country.</p>

<p>“We are sad to see blood getting spilt and my heart goes out to those students who were killed,” she said.</p>

<p>With the death count climbing and police unable to contain the violent protests, the Bangladesh government on Friday imposed a national curfew and deployed the military. Soldiers are patrolling cities across Bangladesh after riot police failed to restore order, while a nationwide internet blackout has drastically restricted the flow of information to the outside world.</p>

<p>Nearly 1,000 Indian students have returned to India from Bangladesh through various land transit points or by flight. External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar said the Foreign Ministry is fully focused on ensuring the safety and well-being of the Indians in Bangladesh.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Mr Obama believes that Mr Biden's path to victory has diminished and he should "seriously consider the viability of his candidacy," the Washington Post said.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United States President Joe Biden has become tired of certain Democratic allies pressuring him to withdraw from the 2024 presidential race. According to <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/19/us/politics/biden-drop-out-2024-election.html">The New York Times</a></em>, sources claimed that Mr Biden has become "irritated" with party leaders, particularly former President Barack Obama, who has reportedly been involved in discussions about the 81-year-old's withdrawal as the Democratic nominee.</p>

<p>Numerous lawmakers have come forward since the first presidential debate, pleading with the president to put an end to his campaign. However, Mr Biden's closest supporters, including Mr Obama and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, have refrained from openly criticising the President, whose campaign has always maintained that he will remain in the White House race.</p>

<p>However, according to the NYT report, Mr Biden views Mr Obama "as a puppet master behind the scenes" regarding conversations on the President's campaign. Sources close to Mr Biden while speaking anonymously, said that the President "has been around politics long enough to assume that the leaks appearing in the media in recent days are being coordinated to raise the pressure on him to step aside."</p>

<p>On July 19, former US president Barack Obama told allies that Joe Biden needs to reconsider his reelection bid, according to a report in the <em>Washington Post</em>. Mr Obama believes that Mr Biden's path to victory has diminished and that the 81-year-old should "seriously consider the viability of his candidacy," the newspaper said, citing people briefed on his thinking.</p>

<p>It said there was no immediate comment from Mr Obama, who was in office while Mr Biden was Vice President from 2009 to 2017 and who remains hugely influential in the Democratic party.</p>

<p>According to a <em>CNN </em>report, Ms Pelosi has also informed Mr Biden that polls indicate he will not be able to defeat Trump and that this might be detrimental to Democrats across the political spectrum. However, in a statement released on Thursday, the former speaker said that the "feeding frenzy" from unidentified sources "misrepresents any conversations" she had with Mr Biden.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is to deliver a landmark speech to the US Congress this week as he fights off intense pressure to cut a Gaza war ceasefire deal with Hamas.</p>

<p>Israel's longest-serving premier will on Wednesday become the first foreign leader to address a joint meeting of the two chambers four times -- pulling ahead of Britain's Winston Churchill on three.</p>

<p>But analysts say the Gaza war since the October 7 Hamas attacks has created worrying tensions between Israel and the United States, its main military and diplomatic backer. Netanyauhu's office announced that he will meet US President Joe Biden on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Washington fears a backlash from the mounting civilian toll in the Gaza Strip, while protests in Israel by families of hostages taken by Hamas are also causing headaches for Netanyahu.</p>

<p>Biden and some Israeli ministers say a deal negotiated through Qatar, Egyptian and US mediators is possible. A plan outlined in May proposed a six-week ceasefire when some Israeli hostages would be swapped for Palestinians held in Israeli prisons.&nbsp;</p>

<p>US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Friday that negotiators were "inside the 10 yard line and driving toward the goal line".</p>

<p>Hamas has accused Netanyahu of seeking to block a deal however and Blinken said he wants to "bring the agreement over the finish line" when Netanyahu is in Washington.</p>

<h2>Double pressure</h2>

<p>Israel has intensified its attacks on Gaza in recent weeks and Netanyahu has insisted that only piling on military pressure can free the hostages and beat Hamas.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"This double pressure is not delaying the deal -– it is advancing it," Netanyahu told troops in Gaza on Thursday.</p>

<p>The October 7 attack on Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,195 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures. Hamas militants also seized 251 hostages, 116 of whom are still in Gaza, including 42 the Israeli military says are dead.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory campaign has killed at least 38,919 people in Gaza, also mostly civilians, according to data from the health ministry in the Hamas-ruled territory.</p>

<p>Publicly, Biden has voiced strong support for Israel. But he expressed concern over an offensive on the southern city of Rafah in May and for a while suspended deliveries of heavy bombs to Israel. Supplies of 2,000-pound bombs remain embargoed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Never before has the atmosphere been so fraught," said Council on Foreign Relations Middle East specialist Steven Cook.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"There is clearly tension in the relationship, especially between the White House and the Israeli prime minister," Cook said in a commentary.</p>

<h2>'Political rhetoric'</h2>

<p>While US Republicans pressed to invite Netanyahu to address Congress, he has lost support among Democrats.</p>

<p>One Jewish senator, Democrat Brian Schatz of Hawaii, announced he would boycott Wednesday's speech, saying he would not listen to "political rhetoric that will do nothing to bring peace in the region".</p>

<p>Netanyahu said after being invited to Congress again that he would "present the truth about our just war against those who seek to destroy us".</p>

<p>Cook said that Netanyahu has two aims for his Washington trip.</p>

<p>First, to show that he has not "undermined" Israel's relations with the United States.</p>

<p>Netanyahu also "will endeavour to shift the conversation away from the conflict in Gaza toward the threat that Iran and its proxies pose" to Israel and the United States, Cook added.</p>

<p>Much attention will be focused on whether Netanyahu meets with Donald Trump or a figure close to the Republican presidential candidate.</p>

<p>Despite the tensions, the United States has defended Israeli interests while taking a key role in mediation efforts, and the military relationship remains strong, according to officials.</p>

<p>Washington's support could prove crucial as Israel faces increasing international criticism over the growing humanitarian toll from nearly 300 days of war.</p>

<p>The International Criminal Court's prosecutor in May asked judges to issue arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant. Warrants for three Hamas leaders have also been requested.</p>

<p>The Republican majority in the House of Representatives has called for sanctions against the ICC.</p>

<p>The International Court of Justice found Israel's occupation of Palestinian territories illegal on Friday, and in February called for the country to prevent any acts of genocide in its Gaza offensive.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iraq said Sunday a new power line will bring electricity from Turkey to its northern provinces as authorities aim to diversify the country's energy sources to ease chronic power outages.</p>

<p>The 115-kilometre line connects to Kisik power plant west of Mosul and will provide 300 megawatts from Turkey to Iraq's northern provinces of Nineveh, Salah al-Din and Kirkuk, according to a statement by the prime minister's office.</p>

<p>PM Mohamed Shia al-Sudani said the new line is a "strategic" step to link Iraq with neighbouring countries.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The line started operating today," Ahmed Moussa, spokesperson for the electricity ministry, told AFP.</p>

<p>Decades of war have left Iraq's infrastructure in a pitiful state, with power cuts worsening the blistering summer when temperatures often reach 50 Celsius (122 Fahrenheit).</p>

<p>Many households have just a few hours of mains electricity per day, and those who can afford it use private generators to keep fridges and air conditioners running.</p>

<p>Despite its vast oil reserves, Iraq remains dependent on imports to meet its energy needs, especially from neighbouring Iran, which regularly cuts supplies.</p>

<p>Sudani has repeatedly stressed the need for Iraq to diversify energy sources to ease the chronic outages.</p>

<p>To reduce its dependence on Iranian gas, Baghdad has been exploring several possibilities including imports from Gulf countries.</p>

<p>In March, a 340-kilometre (210-mile) power line started operating to bring electricity from Jordan to Al-Rutbah in Iraq's southwest.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russia said Sunday that it scrambled fighter jets to prevent two US strategic bomber planes from crossing its border over the Barents Sea in the Arctic.</p>

<p>The US military routinely carries out flights over international waters, operations that it says are conducted in neutral airspace and in accordance with international law.</p>

<p>But Moscow has responded more aggressively to the exercises in recent months, warning in June that US drone flights over the Black Sea risked leading to a "direct" military clash.</p>

<p>The Russian defence ministry said it had scrambled fighter jets to intercept an "air target approaching the state border of the Russian Federation".</p>

<p>"The crews of the Russian fighters identified the aerial target as a pair of US Air Force B-52H strategic bombers," it said.</p>

<p>"As the Russian fighters approached, the American strategic bombers corrected their flight course, moving away and then turning away from Russia's state border," it said.</p>

<p>In June, Moscow accused the United States of using its reconnaissance drone flights over neutral waters in the Black Sea to help Ukraine strike the Russian-annexed Crimean peninsula.</p>

<p>It said that the flights increased the risk of a "direct confrontation" between NATO and Russia, and that its army had been instructed to prepare an "operational response".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A pram carrying twin two-year-old girls rolled into the path of an oncoming train in Sydney on Sunday, police said, in an accident that killed one of the children and the "heroic" father who dashed to their rescue.</p>

<p>One of the little girls survived only "through good luck" after she landed between the rails when the pram fell off a platform at southern Sydney's Carlton railway station, police said.</p>

<p>She was "largely untouched" by the train that apparently passed above her on its way to central Sydney in the early afternoon, police said.</p>

<p>The parents had taken a lift down to the station platform and as they exited, they took "their hands off the pram for a very, very short period of time", New South Wales police superintendent Paul Dunstan said.</p>

<p>"Whether it's a gust of wind or -- we're not quite sure -- but it appears that the pram has instantly started to roll in the direction of the train lines," he told a news conference.</p>

<p>Police and emergency services arrived within a few minutes of being alerted and were able to see the pram under the train, which had slowed on approach but was not scheduled to stop at the station.</p>

<p>"You could hear crying coming from underneath the train," the police superintendent said.</p>

<p>Though one of the children was unharmed, the other girl and her 40-year-old father had been killed.</p>

<p>The father had "just gone into parent mode" and tried to save his daughters, Dunstan said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"In doing so it's cost him his life, but it's an incredibly brave and heroic act by the dad."</p>

<p>The mother and her surviving daughter were taken to the local St. George Hospital, and were said to be in a stable condition.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The 39-year-old mother was "in a state of shock and struggling with what's happened" while being supported by family and friends in their local Indian community, Dunstan said.</p>

<p>New South Wales Premier Chris Minns said the local community would be pained by the accident.</p>

<p>"I hope over time they can gain some small solace knowing that the father died from an extraordinary, instinctive act of bravery," Minns said.</p>

<p>"In the face of a terrible, terrible accident, he gave his own life to try and save his children."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bangladesh's top court on Sunday pared back contentious civil service hiring rules but failed to mollify university student leaders, whose demonstrations against the scheme sparked nationwide clashes that have killed 155 people.</p>

<p>What began as a protest against politicised admission quotas for sought-after government jobs snowballed this week into some of the worst unrest of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's tenure.</p>

<p>Soldiers are patrolling cities across Bangladesh after riot police failed to restore order, while a nationwide internet blackout since Thursday has drastically restricted the flow of information to the outside world.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court was due to decide next month on the legality of the recently reintroduced scheme that reserves more than half of government jobs for select applicants, but brought forward its verdict as the civil strife intensified.</p>

<p>It decided that a lower bench's order last month to reintroduce the scheme was "illegal", Bangladeshi Attorney General AM Amin Uddin told AFP.</p>

<p>Shah Monjurul Hoque, a lawyer involved in the case, told AFP that the court had also asked protesting students "to return to class" after issuing its verdict.</p>

<p>The ruling curtailed the number of reserved jobs, from 56 percent of all positions to seven percent, but fell short of meeting protester demands.</p>

<p>It reserved five percent of all government jobs for the children of "freedom fighters" from Bangladesh's 1971 liberation war against Pakistan, down from 30 percent.</p>

<p>One percent were reserved for tribal communities, and another one percent for people with disabilities or identifying as third gender under Bangladeshi law.</p>

<p>The remaining 93 percent of positions would be decided on merit, the court ruled.</p>

<p>The "freedom fighter" category in particular is a point of resentment for young graduates, with critics saying it is used to stack public jobs with loyalists to Hasina's ruling Awami League.</p>

<p>Students had called for the complete abolition of that category, along with other quotas for women and specific districts of the country.</p>

<p>"We welcome the Supreme Court verdict," a spokesman for Students Against Discrimination, the main group responsible for organising the protests, told AFP on condition of anonymity.</p>

<p>"But we won't call off our protests until the government issues an order reflecting our demands."</p>

<p>'Our demand is one point'</p>

<p>Opponents accuse Hasina's government of bending the judiciary to its will, and the premier had already hinted to the public this week that the court would issue a ruling favourable to student demands.</p>

<p>Hasina, 76, has ruled the country since 2009 and won her fourth consecutive election in January after a vote without genuine opposition.</p>

<p>Her government is accused by rights groups of misusing state institutions to entrench its hold on power and stamp out dissent, including by the extrajudicial killing of opposition activists.</p>

<p>"It's not about the rights of the students anymore," business owner Hasibul Sheikh, 24, told AFP at the scene of a Saturday street protest, held in the capital Dhaka in defiance of a nationwide curfew.</p>

<p>"Our demand is one point now, and that's the resignation of the government."</p>

<p>'Made the situation worse'</p>

<p>With around 18 million young people in Bangladesh out of work, according to government figures, the quota scheme's reintroduction deeply upset graduates facing an acute jobs crisis.</p>

<p>Hasina inflamed tensions this month by likening protesters to the Bangladeshis who had collaborated with Pakistan during the country's independence war.</p>

<p>"Rather than try to address the protesters' grievances, the government's actions have made the situation worse," Crisis Group's Asia director Pierre Prakash told AFP.</p>

<p>Since Tuesday, at least 155 people, including several police officers, have been killed in clashes around the country, according to an AFP count of victims reported by police and hospitals.</p>

<p>Curfew extended</p>

<p>Police have arrested several members of the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and Students Against Discrimination.</p>

<p>Bangladesh home minister Asaduzzaman Khan told AFP that the curfew imposed on Saturday would continue "until the situation improves".</p>

<p>He said that in addition to the torching of government buildings and police posts by protesters, arson attacks had left Dhaka's metro rail network inoperable.</p>

<p>"They are carrying out destructive activities targeting the government," Khan said, blaming the BNP and the Islamist party Jamaat for stoking the violence.</p>

<p>The US State Department warned Americans on Saturday not to travel to Bangladesh and said it would begin removing some diplomats and their families from the country due to the civil unrest.</p>

<p>India and Nepal said they were assisting with the repatriation of their citizens, with nearly 800 Indian students returning home as of Saturday.</p>

<p>"They were in a mood to kill each other, that's scary," student Shivam Kumar Shah, 24, told AFP at Kathmandu Airport in Nepal after returning from unrest at his university in Dhaka.</p>

<p>"A place to acquire knowledge and wisdom has turned a battlefield, this is unfortunate."</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Malena Galletto, 17, has received acceptance letters from all eight Ivy League Schools. Not just that, the young sensation, from Washington Heights, has also received positive outcomes from the other 20 colleges and universities she applied to, reported the <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/07/20/us-news/bronx-science-hs-graduate-accepted-into-all-28-colleges-she-applies-to-including-the-eight-ivy-leagues/">NY Post.</a></p>

<p dir="ltr">“When I was about to open [an admissions] letter, I would prepare myself for it to be the first rejection letter. And then I would open them and it would always say, ‘Congratulations on being accepted!” Ms Galletto was quoted as saying.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">Ms Galletto, who got a 97% GPA, said that she got her first acceptance from the University of Albany.</p>

<p dir="ltr">She added, “For as long as I can remember, school has always been my number one priority. Even in elementary school, I remember always wanting to be at the top of my class,” she said, crediting her parents, both of whom teach tango and immigrated from their native Argentina to Washington Heights in 2000. They instilled in her that “education was the most important thing.”</p>

<p dir="ltr">Recalling the moment when she received the letter from Harvard University, Ms Galletto said, “The first one I opened was from Cornell [University], and when that was a ‘Yes,' it was life-changing…But when I opened Harvard [University], I was absolutely screaming. Deep down, it was always Harvard for me.”</p>

<p dir="ltr">Ms Galletto's mother Karina Romero also expressed her excitement about her daughter's achievements. “I am so incredibly proud. She's always studying and doing her very best, and I'm so happy she got what she worked so hard to achieve,” she said.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Ms Galletto has also received a shout-out from City Department of Education spokeswoman Nicole Brownstein. As per Ms Brownstein, the result is a “testament to her [Malena Galletto] hard work and dedication.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One person has died after a plane, used for skydiving, crashed in Niagara County, New York on Saturday, reported CNN. Following the incident, New York officials launched an investigation on Saturday.</p>

<p>The single-engine Cessna 208B, a plane that was used for skydiving, crashed near Lake Road near Youngstown, New York, shortly before 1 pm, the Federal Aviation Administration said in a statement.</p>

<p>The aeroplane from the Skydive the Falls skydiving centre had released all divers and was heading back to land when it crashed, according to a news release from the Niagara County Sheriff's Office on Saturday, as reported by CNN.</p>

<p>A spokesperson for the FAA, Tammy L. Jones, said that the pilot, who was the only person on board, was conducting parachute operations prior to the crash.</p>

<p>However, it is still unclear how many divers were on board before the crash, Niagara County Sheriff Michael Filicetti said at a news conference on Saturday.</p>

<p>Later, a brush fire also reportedly began around the crash site, according to the release.</p>

<p>The initial responding crew had to put out "a significant fire at that point," Filicetti said.</p>

<p>The sheriff called the plane crash "an unfortunate incident" and added that local and federal law enforcement partners are working to determine what led to the crash.</p>

<p>"Well, I think this is like any other emergency-type incident...You get here, you want to try to preserve life. Unfortunately, in this case, we couldn't do that," Filicetti said.</p>

<p>A National Transportation Safety Board investigator is expected to be travelling to the crash site on Saturday, NTSB spokesperson Peter Knudson told CNN.</p>

<p>The investigator will further document the aeroplane wreckage, which will then be moved to a secure facility for further evaluation, Knudson mentioned.</p>

<p>The investigation will involve three primary areas, including, the pilot, the aircraft and the operating environment, CNN reported.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>China supports Iran in defending its "sovereignty, security and national dignity", Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi told Iran's acting foreign minister in a phone call on Sunday, according to a statement by China's foreign ministry.</p>

<p>In the phone call, Wang repeated Beijing's denunciation of the assassination of Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran on July 31, saying the strike had violated Iran's sovereignty and threatened regional stability.</p>

<p>Iran and the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas have accused Israel of carrying out strike that killed Haniyeh.</p>

<p>Israel has not claimed or denied responsibility for the killing, which has fueled concern that the war between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip was turning into a wider Middle East war.</p>

<p>Iran has vowed to "harshly punish" Israel over the assassination.</p>

<p>Wang told Ali Bagheri Kani, Iran's Acting Foreign Minister, that the killing of Haniyeh had "directly undermined the Gaza ceasefire negotiation process and undermined regional peace and stability," China's foreign ministry said.</p>

<p>"China supports Iran in defending its sovereignty, security and national dignity in accordance with the law, and in its efforts to maintain regional peace and stability, and stands ready to maintain close communication with Iran," Wang was quoted as saying.</p>

<p>Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian on Sunday nominated Abbas Araqchi as the country's foreign minister. Araqchi had been Iran's chief negotiator in nuclear talks from 2013 to 2021.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russia's army appeared to acknowledge Sunday that Ukrainian units had driven deep into the country, saying it had hit troops and equipment around 30 kilometres (20 miles) from the border.</p>

<p>Kyiv launched a surprise border incursion last Tuesday, shocking Russia, which has sent in additional reserves, tanks, drones, artillery and aviation to try to quash the offensive.</p>

<p>The defence ministry in Moscow said Sunday that its troops had "foiled attempts by enemy mobile groups with armoured vehicles to break through deep into Russian territory."</p>

<p>But in an apparent sign of how far some Ukrainian units have managed to advance, it said it had hit enemy units near the villages of Tolpino and Obshchy Kolodez, which are around 25 km and 30 km from the Russia-Ukraine border.</p>

<p>A senior Ukrainian official told AFP that "thousands" of its troops had been deployed to the operation.</p>

<p>Russia's army said Sunday it had continued to use aviation, drones and artillery to try to put down the attack.</p>

<p>It also said it had foiled an attempt by Ukraine to break into another border district of the Kursk region, further to the south from where the bulk of the fighting has occurred so far.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The UK government said on Sunday schools in England could teach children how to spot extremist and online content spreading "putrid conspiracy theories", under planned changes to the national curriculum.</p>

<p>Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson said she was launching a review of the curriculum in primary and secondary schools to introduce critical thinking across multiple subjects.</p>

<p>It follows recent disorder in more than a dozen English towns and cities following the Southport knife attack, which officials say were fuelled by misinformation online and far-right agitators.</p>

<p>The stabbing spree, allegedly carried out by British-born Axel Rudakubana, who was aged 17 at the time, left three children dead. Police have not disclosed a suspected motive for the attack but said it is not being treated as terrorism.</p>

<p>Online speculation in the immediate aftermath of the tragedy falsely claimed Rudakubana was a Muslim immigrant.</p>

<p>"It's more important than ever that we give young people the knowledge and skills to be able to challenge what they see online," Phillipson told the Sunday Telegraph newspaper.</p>

<p>"That's why our curriculum review will develop plans to embed critical skills in lessons to arm our children against the disinformation, fake news and putrid conspiracy theories awash on social media."</p>

<p>Under the envisaged changes, students would analyse newspaper articles in English lessons to help spot fabricated clickbait, while computer classes would include analysing statistics in context.</p>

<p>However, the review is not set to report its findings and recommendations until next year, meaning reforms would not come into force until the school year starting in September, 2025, according to the Telegraph.</p>

<p>The moves are set to be combined with tougher regulation of social media sites and online content, with Prime Minister Keir Starmer suggesting imminent action on Friday.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The lawyer of the main suspect in a foiled plot to carry out an attack at Taylor Swift concert in Vienna on Sunday sought to play down the seriousness of the plan, saying her client was only "playing with ideas".</p>

<p>Swift's three planned concerts this week were cancelled after Austrian authorities discovered a plot allegedly led by a 19-year-old to carry out an ISIS-inspired suicide attack at a soccer stadium where tens of thousands of fans were planning to attend the shows.</p>

<p>Austrian investigators said the youth had recently sworn a pledge to ISIS and had made a full confession after police raided his house, seizing chemicals, machetes and other devices the plotters planned to use in a bomb attack.</p>

<p>Lawyer Ina-Christin Stiglitz told Reuters the youth had only been involved with ISIS for the past month.</p>

<p>"It interested him," she said, suggesting that her client had not really intended to carry out a serious attack.</p>

<p>"It was just playing with ideas," she said. "He says the bomb wasn't of good enough quality, it wouldn't have worked."</p>

<p>He had researched online on how to build a bomb, she added.</p>

<p>Among three other teenagers Austrian police have detained in the investigation was a 17-year-old youth, whom Stiglitz said her client had described as his "best friend and neighbour".</p>

<p>Neighbours of the 19-year-old in the small town of Ternitz expressed shock at his arrest, describing him as reserved but friendly. One of few hints pointing to potential radicalization was that he had recently grown a long beard, they said.</p>

<p>Responding to a question about why he had changed his appearance, his lawyer said: "He wanted to be cool."</p>

<p>Chancellor Karl Nehammer said earlier that Austria's intelligence agencies should have greater power to monitor communications on messaging apps to stop extremists.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A BSF officer is winning hearts for his calmness while explaining hundreds of Bangladesh refugees gathered at India's border why they cannot let them in.&nbsp;The video, shared by former Union Minister and Shiv Sena leader Milind Deora, shows the officer speaking to a group of refugees in a border area in West Bengal's Coochbehar.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Speaking in Bengali, the officer is heard saying, "We all know the problems you are facing. You have come here, but a discussion is required. The problem cannot be solved in this manner. We cannot let you in even if we want."</p>

<p>As the gathering protests, the officer continues, "Please listen to me, nothing will come out of shouting. The whole world knows your problem. But a discussion is needed. Once the discussion happens, we will see how we can protect you. You can see, senior officers are here. But if you say that we have to allow you immediately, is that possible?"</p>

<p>"I request you on behalf of my country. Your problems would be addressed through a discussion. We request you to go back, a solution cannot be find in an hour or two," the officer is heard saying in a video shared by The Indian Express.</p>

<p>Voices from the crowd are heard pleading with the BSF personnel to let them. "They will burn our homes, we will face atrocities," the crowd shouts.</p>

<p>The BSF officer says the officers know they are in trouble. "My seniors have had discussions with your force. They will listen to your problems. They have asked you to return," he says.</p>

<p>Praising the officer for his composure, Mr Deora said in a post on X, "This video of a BSF officer calmly explaining to Bangladeshis why they can't enter India illegally is heartbreaking, inspirational &amp; reassuring all at once."</p>

<p>"Heartbreaking to see the desperation; inspirational to witness the officer's calm composure; reassuring to know the government is committed to securing India's borders," said the Rajya Sabha MP, who switched from the Congress to the Eknath Shinde-led Sena earlier this year.</p>

<p>Bangladeshi nationals fleeing violence and arson in the aftermath of Sheikh Hasina's ouster as Prime Minister have gathered at India's borders in several areas. The BSF is keeping close vigil on the borders. In Bangladesh, members of the Hindu community are holding demonstrations to protest against the attacks on homes and businesses of Hindus.&nbsp;</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Thousands of Ukrainian troops are taking part in an incursion aiming to destabilise Russia by showing up its weaknesses, a top Ukrainian official has told AFP as the assault entered its sixth day.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p>

<p>Thousands of Ukrainian troops are taking part in a major incursion into Russian territory, aiming to destabilise Russia by showing up its weaknesses, a top Ukrainian official has told AFP.</p>

<p>"We are on the offensive. The aim is to stretch the positions of the enemy, to inflict maximum losses and to destabilise the situation in Russia as they are unable to protect their own border," the security official said on condition of anonymity.</p>

<p>The Russian army had said about 1,000 Ukrainian troops were deployed in the cross-border incursion, which began on Tuesday and appeared to catch the Kremlin off guard, allowing Ukrainian forces to penetrate Russian defensive lines.</p>

<p>Asked whether the 1,000 figure was right, the official said: "It is a lot more... Thousands".</p>

<p>After days of official silence, President Volodymyr Zelensky acknowledged the offensive for the first time in his nightly address on Saturday, saying that Kyiv was "pushing the war into the aggressor's territory".</p>

<p>Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022 and has waged an unrelenting campaign, occupying swathes of eastern and southern Ukraine and subjecting Ukrainian cities to daily missile and drone attacks.</p>

<p>After re-capturing large areas in 2022, Ukrainian forces have largely been on the backfoot and are increasingly struggling with manpower and arms supplies.</p>

<p>But Ukrainian units stormed across the border Tuesday in the largest and most successful such offensive by Kyiv so far.</p>

<p>Its troops have advanced several kilometres, forcing Russia's army to rush in reserves and extra equipment -- though neither side has given precise details on the forces committed.</p>

<p>Russia has evacuated more than 76,000 civilians from the area, while Ukraine said last week it needs to evacuate 20,000 from the Sumy region across the border.</p>

<h3><strong>Morale boost for Ukraine</strong></h3>

<p>Russia's defence ministry on Sunday published footage it said was of its troops destroying Ukrainian military equipment that had advanced into its western Kursk region.</p>

<p>The shock offensive is now into its sixth day.</p>

<p>The attack has "greatly raised our morale, the morale of the Ukrainian army, state and society", the Ukrainian official said, speaking late Saturday after weeks of Russian advances in eastern Ukraine.</p>

<p>"This operation has shown that we can go on the offensive, move forward," the official said.</p>

<p>"It seems that the Russians have problems with coordination, preparedness for action," he said.</p>

<p>But he said there had been little effect so far on fighting in the east.</p>

<p>"The situation is basically unchanged. Their pressure in the east continues, they are not pulling back troops from the area," he said, adding only that "the intensity of Russian attacks has gone down a little bit".</p>

<p>The official said Ukrainian troops would respect international humanitarian law while on Russian territory and had no plans to annex areas they currently hold.</p>

<p>"There is no idea of annexation... We are operating in strict accordance with international law," he said, contrasting this with alleged violations by Russian troops in occupied territory.</p>

<p>Asked whether capturing the Kursk nuclear power plant near the border was an aim, he said: "We will see how the Kursk operation will develop".</p>

<p>"We absolutely will not cause problems for nuclear security. This we can guarantee," he said.</p>

<p>The International Atomic Energy Agency has urged both sides "to exercise maximum restraint in order to avoid a nuclear accident with the potential for serious radiological consequences".</p>

<h3><strong>Western partners 'indirectly' involved</strong></h3>

<p>The White House said Wednesday it was contacting Ukraine to learn more about the "objectives" of the incursion.</p>

<p>President Joe Biden in May allowed Kyiv to use American-supplied weapons against targets just across the Russian border to repel Moscow's push on the Kharkiv region.</p>

<p>But White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby has said that "nothing had changed" about US policy discouraging broader strikes or attacks inside Russia.</p>

<p>Asked whether Western partners had been kept in the dark about Ukraine's offensive, the official said this was "incorrect".</p>

<p>"Judging by how actively Western arms are being used, our Western partners played a part indirectly in the planning," he said.</p>

<p>The official said he expected Russia would "in the end" manage to stop Ukrainian forces in Kursk and retaliate with a large-scale missile attack including "on decision-making centres" in Ukraine.</p>

<p>There has already been more intense bombardment of Ukraine's Sumy region just across the border from Kursk.</p>

<p>An overnight missile attack near the Ukrainian capital Kyiv killed a man and his four-year-old son, emergency services said.</p>

<p>Russia also promised a "tough response" after it said a Ukrainian missile strike wounded 15 in the city of Kursk, around 90 kilometres (55 miles) from the border.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The son of Bangladesh's toppled autocratic leader thanked New Delhi on Sunday for "saving her life", accused caretaker authorities of allowing "mob rule" and warned of chaos ahead without swift elections.</p>

<p>Sheikh Hasina, 76, quit as prime minister on Monday after a student-led uprising and fled by helicopter to longtime ally India.</p>

<p>Her government was accused of widespread human rights abuses, including the extrajudicial killing of thousands of her political opponents during her 15-year tenure.</p>

<p>The military announced her resignation and then agreed to student demands that Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus, 84, lead a caretaker administration, charged with ending disorder and enacting democratic reforms.</p>

<p>However, Hasina's son and former government adviser, US-based Sajeeb Wazed Joy, 53, criticised the interim government as "completely powerless" and composed of "figureheads".</p>

<p>"Right now in Bangladesh, you have mob rule," he told AFP in an interview from Washington.</p>

<p>He pointed to the ouster of top officials, including the chief justice, central bank governor and police chief, following protesters' demands.</p>

<p>"If the mob tomorrow says, 'no, we want this person in the interim government changed', they will have to be changed," he said.</p>

<h3><strong>'Devolve into chaos'</strong></h3>

<p>Yunus has said he wants elections "within a few months", but Wazed warned of risks if they were delayed.</p>

<p>"It's in their best interest to hold elections... to have a return to a legitimate government that has the legitimacy of the people and true authority," he said.</p>

<p>"Otherwise, it's just going to devolve into chaos."</p>

<p>Hasina swept January elections but only after a poll denounced as neither free nor fair and boycotted by genuine rivals after a crackdown during which thousands of opposition party members were arrested.</p>

<p>Members of Hasina's millions-strong Awami League have gone into hiding since she fled. There have been reprisal attacks against them and party offices have been torched.</p>

<p>But Wazed said the party was critical to the political future of the South Asian nation of some 170 million people.</p>

<p>"We have tens of millions of followers; they're not going anywhere," he said.</p>

<p>"You're not going to be able to establish democracy in Bangladesh without the Awami League. It will never be accepted by half the people of the country at least."</p>

<p>Former opposition groups such as the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) are rebuilding after years of repression, the BNP holding a peaceful mass rally in Dhaka since Monday.</p>

<p>"It's going to be between the BNP and the Awami League," Wazed said. "We need to work together."</p>

<h3><strong>'Excessive force'</strong></h3>

<p>Wazed sought to divert blame for his mother's ouster onto others in government.</p>

<p>"Were mistakes made? Of course," he said. "They were made by people at the bottom, or in the chain of command... Blaming my mother for it is unfortunate."</p>

<p>While accepting that police officers who fired on protesters had gone too far, he argued that there was violence on both sides.</p>

<p>"Some of the police used excessive force but there were attacks on the police too -- police members were killed as well. The violence wasn't one-sided," he said.</p>

<p>"And then as it escalated further, the protesters started attacking police with firearms, weapons."</p>

<p>More than 450 people were killed in the unrest leading up to Hasina's fall -- 42 of whom were police officers, according to the national police chief.</p>

<p>Wazed alleged unidentified foreign forces had supported the protests, a claim for which he provided no evidence.</p>

<p>"I believe, at this point, it is from beyond Bangladesh," he said.</p>

<p>"Only an intelligence agency would have the capability of smuggling and supplying weapons to protesters."</p>

<p>It is not clear what Hasina will do next.</p>

<p>Wazed offered his "gratitude to the government of Prime Minister (Narendra) Modi for saving her life and keeping her safe".</p>

<p>New Delhi saw a common threat in groups Hasina viewed as rivals and crushed with brutal force, including the BNP, according to analysts.</p>

<p>Hasina has been hosted in a secret safe house and hasn't spoken publicly since arriving at a military airbase near New Delhi.</p>

<p>It isn't clear how long she will now stay in India but Wazed said there "has been no such plans as of yet" of her moving to a third country.</p>

<p>"My mother never wanted to leave her country -- her dream is to retire there," he said, adding he spoke to her every day.</p>

<p>"This was going to be her last term. She's 76 years old. And so she just wants to go back home. Whether she'll be able to, we're waiting to see."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bangladesh's new chief justice has been sworn into office after his predecessor, viewed as a loyalist of toppled premier Sheikh Hasina, quit following protester demands, a presidential official said Sunday.</p>

<p>It is the latest in a string of fresh appointments to replace an old guard viewed as linked to the previous regime, ousted by the student-led uprising.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Syed Refaat Ahmed, the senior-most high court judge, was sworn into office by President Mohammed Shahabuddin, the president's press secretary Shiplu Zaman told AFP.</p>

<p>"He became the 25th chief justice of Bangladesh," Zaman said.</p>

<p>Ahmed studied at the University of Dhaka, Oxford and Tufts University in the United States.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hasina, 76, fled by helicopter to neighbouring India on Monday as protesters flooded Dhaka's streets in a dramatic end to her iron-fisted rule.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Her government was accused of widespread human rights abuses including the extrajudicial killing of thousands of her political opponents over her 15-year rule.</p>

<p>Cabinet ministers left blindsided by her sudden fall have gone to ground, while several top appointees have been forced out of office -- including the national police chief and the central bank governor.</p>

<p>Ahmed's predecessor Obaidul Hassan on Saturday became the latest to announce his departure, after hundreds of protesters gathered outside the court to demand he step down.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Appointed last year, Hassan earlier oversaw a much-criticised war crimes tribunal that ordered the execution of Hasina's opponents, and his brother was her longtime secretary.</p>

<p>Bangladesh's interim leader, Nobel laureate, Muhammad Yunus, 84, returned from Europe this week to lead a temporary administration facing the monumental challenge of ending disorder and enacting democratic reforms.</p>

<p>The restoration of law and order is the caretaker administration's "first priority", Yunus said.</p>

<p>Yunus won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006 for his pioneering work in microfinance, credited with helping millions of Bangladeshis out of grinding poverty.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He took office Thursday as "chief advisor" to a caretaker administration, comprised of fellow civilians bar one retired brigadier-general, and has said he wants to hold elections "within a few months".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">NASA has shared a captivating image of the Earth's terminator, the thin line separating day and night.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The picture, taken from the International Space Station (ISS) orbiting 267 miles above the Pacific Ocean, shows the breathtaking moment when a new day dawns on our planet.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The ISS, which completes 16 orbits of the Earth in 24 hours, offers a unique vantage point to witness the terminator, a phenomenon that occurs when the sun's rays illuminate the Earth's atmosphere, creating a distinct boundary between night and day. This boundary is visible as a thin, glowing line on the horizon, where the blue of the atmosphere meets the golden hues of sunrise.</p>

<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>Understanding the Earth's terminator</strong></h3>

<p dir="ltr">The Earth's terminator is the moving line that separates day and night on our planet, as per <a href="https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/11353#:~:text=You%20can%20see%20this%20from,in%20sync%20with%20the%20seasons.">NASA</a>. It is a result of the Earth's rotation and its position relative to the Sun. It passes through most locations on Earth twice a day, once for sunrise and once for sunset, except for areas near the North and South Poles which experience long periods of darkness or sunlight during winter or summer months.</p>

<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>How Earth's terminator affects/changes seasons</strong></h3>

<p dir="ltr">The Earth's axis is tilted at 23.5 degrees, which causes the Northern and Southern Hemispheres to receive varying amounts of sunlight throughout the year. This tilt leads to the changing of the seasons, NASA says.</p>

<p dir="ltr">During the equinoxes (March and September), the Earth's axis is perpendicular to its orbit, and the terminator is straight. Both hemispheres receive equal amounts of sunlight, resulting in milder temperatures and moderate weather.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The solstices (June and December) occur when the Earth's tilt is most pronounced, and the terminator is curved. One hemisphere receives more daylight than the other, resulting in the longest and shortest days of the year.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The Earth's tilt also affects the distribution of sunlight, impacting the length of days and nights. As the terminator moves, it alters the environment and influences natural processes.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The March equinox typically occurs around March 20/21, and the September equinox around September 22/23. The June solstice occurs around June 20/21, and the December solstice around December 21/22. These dates can vary slightly due to the Earth's elliptical orbit and the gravitational pull of other celestial bodies.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr on Sunday condemned Chinese air force actions in waters of the South China Sea claimed by both countries, calling the actions "unjustified, illegal and reckless".</p>

<p>Manila and Beijing accused each other on Saturday of disrupting their militaries' operations around the Scarborough Shoal in the first incident since Marcos took office in 2022 in which the Philippines has complained of dangerous actions by Chinese aircraft, as opposed to navy or coast guard vessels.</p>

<p>The Philippine military on Saturday condemned "dangerous and provocative actions" when two Chinese aircraft dropped flares in the path of a Philippine aircraft during a routine patrol around the shoal on Thursday.</p>

<p>The Chinese military's Southern Theatre Command countered that the Philippines had disrupted its training, accusing Manila of "illegally intruding" into Chinese airspace.</p>

<p>On Sunday, Marcos urged China to act responsibly both in the seas and in the skies.</p>

<p>"We have hardly started to calm the waters, and it is already worrying that there could be instability in our airspace," Marcos said in a statement posted by the Presidential Communications Office on the social media platform X.</p>

<p>The Chinese embassy in Manila did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Sunday.</p>

<p>The Scarborough Shoal is one of Asia's most contested maritime features and a flashpoint for flare-ups over sovereignty and fishing rights.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Before she resigned as Bangladesh Prime Minister and fled her Dhaka residence, Sheikh Hasina wanted to address the nation, especially the protesters whose agitation forced her to quit the top job. That speech was never delivered as the protesters reached her doorstep and the country's top security officers advised to leave at the earliest.</p>

<p><strong>Big Charge Against US</strong></p>

<p>Now in India, the 76-year-old has spoken to her close associates about the undelivered speech, accessed by NDTV. In the letter, Sheikh Hasina has accused the US for plotting a regime change in the country and would have said this in her speech if she got a chance.</p>

<p>"I resigned so that I did not have to see the procession of dead bodies. They wanted to come to power over the dead bodies of students, but I did not allow it. I resigned from premiership. I could have remained in power if I had surrendered the sovereignty of Saint Martin Island and allowed America to hold sway over the Bay of Bengal. I beseech to the people of my land, please do not be manipulated by radicals," her undelivered speech says.</p>

<p>The Saint Martin island has an area of just 3 square kilometres and is located in the northeastern part of Bay of Bengal. It is the southernmost part of Bangladesh.</p>

<p>"Maybe, if I had stayed in the country, more lives would have been lost. I have removed myself. You were my strength, you did not want me, so I have left," it adds.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In her message to her party members, she has said Awami League has always bounced back. "Don't lose hope. I will return soon. I have lost but the people of Bangladesh have won, the people for whom my father, my family died," the speech adds.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Awami League leader had to resign and flee the country amid violent protests by students that started as an agitation against reservation and snowballed into a stand-off with the Sheikh Hasina government. Over 400 protesters were killed as the veteran leader tried to crush the protests.</p>

<p><strong>Hasina Clarifies Razakar Remark</strong></p>

<p>"If I had remained in the country, more lives would have been lost more resources would have been destroyed. I made the extremely difficult decision to exit. I became your leader because you chose me, you were my strength," the undelivered speech says.</p>

<p>It adds that she is pained by the targeting of Awami League leaders and that she "will return soon". "Awami League has stood up again and again. I shall forever pray for the future of Bangladesh."</p>

<p>She also clarified that she never called the protesting students Razakars.</p>

<p>In one of the statements during the protests, Sheikh Hasina had said, "If not the grandchildren of the freedom fighters, then who will get quota benefits? The grandchildren of the 'Razakars'?" The word, used to refer to a paramilitary force recruited by the Pakistani army during the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War, sparked a massive backlash and the protests intensified. In her undelivered address to the nation, the Awami League leader has said, "I have never called you Razakars. Rather my words were distorted to incite you. I request you to watch the full video."</p>

<p><strong>Hasina's Rocky Ties With US</strong></p>

<p>Relations between the US and Bangladesh had nosedived during Sheikh Hasina's term so much so that Washington DC had said the January elections in which Awami League returned to power were not free or fair.</p>

<p>Months before her exit, Sheikh Hasina had claimed that "conspiracies" were being hatched to topple her government and alleged a "white man's" plot to carve a new "Christian country" out of Bangladesh and Myanmar. "If I allowed a certain country to build an airbase in Bangladesh, then I would have had no problem," she had said in May.</p>

<p>Following her resignation and escape, the US said, "The United States has long called for respecting democratic rights in Bangladesh, and we urge that the interim government formation be democratic and inclusive." Washington DC also said that the US greatly values its relationship with the people of Bangladesh.</p>

<p>Earlier, US State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller had condemned the violence against protesters. "We condemn any violence against peaceful protesters. We've been watching this matter very closely, both from our embassy and officials here in Washington. (We) have been monitoring the protests, have seen the reports of people dying, being killed in the protests. And we again, call on the government to uphold individual's rights to protest peacefully," he had said.</p>

<p><strong>What's Happening In Bangladesh</strong></p>

<p>With Sheikh Hasina gone, an interim government under Nobel peace prize winner and Grameen Bank founder Muhammad Yunus has taken charge. Amid reports of attacks on minorities, he has asked students leading the protests to ensure that they their efforts are sabotaged.</p>

<p>"There are many standing by to make your efforts futile. Don't fail this time," he said, urging them to protect Hindu, Christian, and Buddhist families from harm. "Are they not the people of this country? You have been able to save the country; can't you save some families?...You must say - no one can harm them. They are my brothers; we fought together, and we will stay together," he has said.</p>

<p>In a major development, Bangladesh's Chief Justice Obaidul Hassan and five other top judges on Saturday were forced to resign amid massive student protests demanding a revamp of the judiciary.</p>

<p>Several other top officials, including Dhaka University Vice-Chancellor Professor Dr Maksud Kamal, have also quit after protests.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The success of the Paris Olympics 2024 has surpassed the wildest dreams of many in France but in the next weeks, President Emmanuel Macron still will have to face the reality of the deadlocked politics created by his calling of snap legislative elections.</p>

<p>With the Games just around the corner, the polls left France with three major blocs in parliament -- the left as the largest followed by Macron's centrist forces and the far right -- with none of them close to mustering the numbers for an overall majority.</p>

<p>The former government of Macron's allies, under Prime Minister Gabriel Attal, has carried on in a caretaker capacity throughout the Games, but five weeks after the elections, the country still does not have a new prime minister.</p>

<p>Macron may be hoping that the Games boost his embattled fortunes in the same way that France's winning and hosting of the 1998 football World Cup dragged up former president Jacques Chirac's popularity ratings.</p>

<p>But even with Paris set to continue basking in the limelight while hosting the Paralympics from August 28 to September 8, Macron faces a potentially fraught return to reality.</p>

<p>While the Games have lifted what was a morose mood in France, it is far from certain this will give a new impulse to the remaining three years of the unpopular president's mandate.</p>

<h3><strong>'Very angry'</strong></h3>

<p>"The fact that things are going well, that we are seen as beautiful and successful abroad, has struck a chord in a country that was experiencing decline and was no longer capable of doing great things collectively," said prominent political commentator Emmanuel Riviere.</p>

<p>"This changes the collective climate but not the political situation: the situation remains blocked, many voters are frustrated... The French are putting things into perspective and remain very angry with Emmanuel Macron."</p>

<p>Macron's approval ratings remain well under 30 percent, with the president keeping a low profile during the election campaign and the Games, spending most of the Olympics ensconced in the Mediterranean holiday residence of the French president and making only occasional visits to Paris.</p>

<p>"The country needed this moment of coming together. In terms of the political impact, I remain very reserved," one minister from the outgoing government, who asked not to be named, told AFP.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When it comes to the Olympics, "we cannot make it a partisan success", added another.</p>

<h3><strong>'Political change'</strong></h3>

<p>The number one priority for Macron will be naming, and winning approval for, a new prime minister and government, a process that appears to remain as blocked as it was before the Games.</p>

<p>The left-wing New Popular Front, which emerged as the largest faction post-election, has said it wants the economist Lucie Castets to be the new premier.</p>

<p>Macron's forces have shown little interest in the idea, preferring an alliance with the traditional right, with the name of former Chirac-era minister and current head of the northern Hauts de France region, Xavier Bertrand, frequently cited as a candidate to lead a centre-focused coalition.</p>

<p>Outgoing equality minister Aurore Berge named Bertrand as a possible candidate alongside the likes of former EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier and Senate speaker Gerard Larcher, saying he had "solid experience of government, parliament and compromise".</p>

<p>Naming him would be an "aberration", objected Castets, while Greens leader Marine Tondelier accused Macron of exploiting the political "truce" he called for the Olympics.</p>

<p>"This Olympic truce is not just because Emmanuel Macron is tired, it is because he wants time" and "to obstruct any attempt at political change", she said.</p>

<p>There had been an expectation that Macron could name the new premier in the window between the Olympics, which close on Sunday, and the opening of the Paralympics on August 28.</p>

<p>But as visitors and Parisians gasp in awe for the last time at the Olympic cauldron tethered to a balloon, sources within the executive are playing down the prospects of a rapid breakthrough.</p>

<p>"It (the Olympics) will calm things down in the sense that the idea that we work together will be less absurd," said a senior figure close to Macron, asking not to be named.</p>

<p>"But it's not because we went to take selfies in front of the cauldron with half of Paris that we're suddenly going to form a coalition."</p>

<p>Macron, known to use his vacations at the Fort de Bregancon holiday residence for deep reading and reflection, is "still thinking", according to a person close to him.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden last month announced his<a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/joe-biden-quits-us-presidential-race-full-text-of-announcement-6156766#:~:text=It%20has%20been%20the%20greatest,the%20remainder%20of%20my%20term." target="_blank"> exit from the 2024 presidential race</a> amid growing concerns over his health and a disastrous debate performance against rival Donald Trump.</p>

<p>After initially insisting he would stay in the race, the 81-year-old on July 21 announced his decision to step aside in a social media post while recovering from COVID-19 at his Delaware beach house.</p>

<p>Now, in an interview, Biden has shared his reasons for not seeking re-election.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“When I ran the first time, I thought of myself as being a transition president,” he said in an interview with <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/president-joe-biden-talks-exclusively-with-cbs-sunday-morning-about-withdrawing-from-race/" target="_blank">CBS</a>. “I can't even say how old I am – it's hard for me to get it out of my mouth.”</p>

<p>He also stated the importance of defeating Trump, the Republican nominee.</p>

<p>“Although it's a great honour to be a president, I think I have an obligation to the country to do what I -- most important thing you can do. And that is — we must, we must, we must defeat Trump,” he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This interview follows his exit announcement, in which he endorsed his deputy Kamala Harris as the Democratic nominee.</p>

<p>Harris is set to become the official Democratic nominee at the party's national convention in Chicago later this month.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When asked about his confidence in a peaceful transfer of power in January 2025, Biden stated, “If Trump loses, I'm not confident at all. He means what he says. We don't take him seriously.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>He referenced Trump's previous comments, including warnings of a “bloodbath” and claims of a “stolen election”.</p>

<p>“You can't love your country only when you win,” Biden said.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The 24-year-old said that he began using social media in 2015 and experienced several problems with productivity and body image.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A man from Montreal, Canada, is filing a class-action lawsuit against social media platforms TikTok, YouTube, Reddit, Instagram, and Facebook alleging that they are too addictive and have a lot of negative impact on mental health, as per <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://montreal.ctvnews.ca/montreal-man-launches-class-action-lawsuit-against-social-media-platforms-for-being-too-addictive-1.6986404"><em>CTV News.</em></a></p>

<p>The 24-year-old said that he began using social media in 2015 and experienced several problems with productivity and body image. According to the lawsuit, he utilised social networking apps for up to four hours every day, but he has subsequently cut that down to about two hours. "He still finds that it has an effect on his productivity and his sleep," said Philippe Brault from Lambert Avocats, the law firm representing the man.</p>

<p>"In 2024, it's estimated that humanity as a whole will be using social media for a total of 500 million years," Mr Brault added. "That just goes to show that it's not a problem for a certain number of individuals, it's a widespread problem for everyone," he continued, adding that the firm took the case since this is an ever-growing problem.</p>

<p>Mr Brault also pointed out that 52 per cent of Canadian children between the ages of 7 and 11 use social media, and that platform owners must prioritise the health and safety of their users.</p>

<p>The case aims to recover damages and punitive damages for the purportedly careless platform design of these companies. According to Lambert Avocats, the psychological weaknesses of users are exploited by the way social media programs are now designed, leading to a prolonged engagement that affects their daily lives. "We're also looking to get this message out there by talking to the media. People have to understand the risks to the use of social media," he added.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[With just three months to go for the US Presidential elections, Democratic nominee Kamala Harris has taken the lead over her Republican counterpart Donald Trump in three crucial swing states -- Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With just three months to go for the US Presidential elections, Democratic nominee Kamala Harris has taken the lead over her Republican counterpart Donald Trump in three crucial swing states -- Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan.</p>

<p>According to recent polls conducted by the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/08/10/us/elections/times-siena-poll-registered-voter-crosstabs.html" target="_blank">New York Times</a> and Siena College between August 5 and August 9, Harris leads Trump by four percentage points, with 50% to 46% support among the 1,973 registered voters across the three states.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The polls were conducted in the week Kamala Harris named Tim Walz, the governor of Minnesota, as her running mate.&nbsp;The margin of sampling error was plus or minus 4.8 percentage points in Michigan, plus or minus 4.2 points in Pennsylvania and plus or minus 4.3 points in Wisconsin.</p>

<p>This marks a shift from previous surveys that showed Donald Trump tied to or leading former Democratic candidate Joe Biden.</p>

<p>The US Vice President has taken the lead in these crucial battleground states since Biden endorsed her amid concerns about his cognitive well-being and fitness to govern. Much can change before the November 5 election, but Democrats are enthusiastic about Kamala Harris' candidacy, relieved after President Biden stepped aside.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ms Harris has seen a significant bump in favorability, up 10 points in Pennsylvania, with independent voters viewing her as more intelligent and temperamentally fit to govern.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The US electoral college voting system considers Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan crucial for Mr Harris to retain the White House. Despite Republican attacks, Democrats strongly support Harris, with voter satisfaction increasing by 27 points in the three Midwestern states since May.</p>

<p>However, Democrats need to better communicate Harris's vision for the country. A <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-presidential-elections-donald-trump-agrees-to-debate-kamala-harris-what-latest-polls-suggest-6298163#:~:text=YouGov%20poll&amp;text=In%20swing%20states%2C%20Harris%20and,64%20per%20cent%20for%20Harris.">previous poll</a> found that 60% of registered voters think Trump has a clear vision, compared to 53% for Ms Harris.</p>

<p>Trump still leads on handling the economy and immigration. However, Harris has a 24-point advantage on abortion, which Democrats hope will mobilise voters in swing states like Arizona and Wisconsin.</p>

<p>Harris is viewed more favourably on democracy than Mr Trump, who is facing legal charges related to the 2020 presidential elections and the January 6 Capitol riots.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 4-year-old boy and his 35-year-old father died when debris from a downed Russian weapon fell on the house they were living in near the capital Kyiv, Ukrainian officials said on Sunday.</p>

<p>A 13-year-old child was among the injured in the attack in the Brovary district, in the Kyiv region just northeast of the capital's metropolitan area, Ukraine's emergency services said on the Telegram messaging app.</p>

<p>Workers were shown, in a video posted by the emergency services, clearing brick by brick at night through a pile of building debris and lifting the body of a child from underneath it.</p>

<p>President Volodymyr Zelensky's chief of staff Andriy Yermak said the house was hit by drone debris, but the emergency services said it was missile debris.</p>

<p>"Russia continues to kill people," Yermak posted on Telegram, following Ukraine's wartime practice of not capitalising Russia's name. "It is necessary to destroy its military infrastructure, because the enemy does not accept other arguments."</p>

<p>Reuters could not independently verify the reports. There was no immediate comment from Russia.</p>

<p>Kyiv and Moscow deny targeting civilians in their attacks in the war, which Russia launched in February 2022 and which has killed thousands of people and displaced millions of Ukrainians.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Canadian singer Celine Dion criticised former US President Donald Trump on Saturday for using her song "My Heart Will Go On" from the 1997 film 'Titanic' at <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://x.com/KamalaHQ/status/1822103893427261833">his campaign event in Montana</a> without getting her consent or endorsement.</p>

<p>The 56-year-old issued a strong statement, after the Republican candidate played a video of the hit song about the sinking Titanic as a musical interlude, at his recent rally. A statement on her X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram account said, "Celine Dion's management team and her record label, Sony Music Entertainment Canada Inc, became aware of the unauthorized usage of the video, recording, musical performance, and likeness of Celine Dion singing My Heart Will Go On at a Donald Trump/JD Vance campaign rally in Montana."</p>

<p>It added, "In no way is this use authorized, and Celine Dion does not endorse this or any similar use.... And really, THAT song?"</p>

<p>Since being shared, the post has amassed several reactions on social media.</p>

<p>"Yes they used 'THAT SONG'," said a user.</p>

<p>Another said, "I hope she sues Trump and RNC. But I have to say using the Titanic theme song for the Trump campaign is very appropriate for this sinking political campaign."</p>

<p>"That last line is ICONIC!!" remarked a person.</p>

<p>A fourth said, "Makes one wonder why its sooo difficult for trump &amp; his campaign to adhere to rules/guidelines? Thank you for addressing this unauthorized use."</p>

<p>"For me it's perfect for the Tumptanic!" said an Instagram user.</p>

<p>"Too bad for her - it would be a positive thing. Sadly she doesn't see it that way. I have been her fan for 30 years but I will have to respectfully disagree with her political beliefs," wrote another person.</p>

<p>Notably, the song about the shipwreck in 1912 is more about love, sorrow, and perseverance. The song was written by James Horner and has lyrics by Will Jennings. It took home four Grammys, including Song of the Year and Record of the Year, as well as an Oscar and a Golden Globe for Best Original Song.</p>

<p>During the song's interlude at his rally in Bozeman, Montana, Mr Trump attacked Vice President Kamala Harris, who has been closing the gap on him in the polls. Meanwhile, Ms Harris has been playing Beyonce's song "Freedom," which the pop star granted the Vice President permission to use.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A large crowd gathered outside the Houses of Parliament in London on Saturday to protest the alleged violence against minority Hindus and other groups in Bangladesh following the resignation and departure of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina earlier this week.</p>

<p>Protesters carried Bangladeshi flags and held posters with messages such as "Protect our temples in Bangladesh," "Hindu lives matter," and "We want justice."</p>

<p>They chanted slogans demanding peace and equality amidst the recent surge in violence.</p>

<p>The demonstration included activists from various human rights organizations, members of the Bangladeshi diaspora, and Indian-American Hindu allies standing in solidarity with Bangladesh's Hindu community.</p>

<p>Unadi, a protester from Bangladesh, expressed concern over the helplessness of Bangladeshi Hindus, saying that the majority population prevents them from speaking out against injustices.</p>

<p>"Our country became independent in 1971 so that all communities could live peacefully. But now, we are suffering from atrocities committed by the majority community," Unadi said.</p>

<p>He compared the situation in Bangladesh to other countries, noting that while governments around the world protect their minorities, the opposite is true in Bangladesh, forcing many to flee the country.</p>

<p>"The mentality of the people has to change so that we can live peacefully. In modern times like these, all communities must learn to coexist peacefully. We are all equals," he added.</p>

<p>A protester from the Bengali Christian Association in the UK highlighted the need for equal treatment of all communities.</p>

<p>"I demand the interim government to amend the constitution, as it currently states that Bangladesh is a Muslim country. However, all communities fought for Bangladesh's independence, so the country belongs to everyone," she said.</p>

<p>Another protester pointed out that Bangladeshi minorities are being forced to flee due to ongoing atrocities by the majority community.</p>

<p>"We are gathered here because, for the past five to six days, people in Bangladesh have been torturing and burning our houses. They cannot take our country from us, and they cannot deport us. We want to live safely and peacefully in our country. The violence against minorities must stop," he said.</p>

<p>Another protester shared that his home in Bangladesh had been looted and set on fire just days ago.</p>

<p>"My house was burned. A few days ago, many people looted our house," he said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<h3><strong>Bangladesh's Interim Leader On Attacks On Minorities&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Bangladesh's interim leader <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/bangladeshs-interim-leader-muhammad-yunus-condemns-heinous-attacks-on-minorities-6309380" target="_blank">Muhammad Yunus</a> on Saturday condemned attacks on the minority communities in the violence-hit nation, terming them as "heinous".</p>

<p>Mr Yunus, a Nobel laureate, also urged the students, who are at the forefront of the protests, to protect all Hindu, Christian, and Buddhist families from harm.</p>

<p>"Are they not the people of this country? You have been able to save the country; can't you save some families?... You must say - no one can harm them. They are my brothers; we fought together, and we will stay together," the 84-year-old asserted, underscoring the need for national unity.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The couple, seen in a restaurant-released video, took an hour to eat their meal before leaving "for a cigarette," but they never came back.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A couple who went out to dine allegedly left a bill of 120 pounds (12,000 approximately) behind when they left the restaurant on August 5 after sharing pictures of their meal on Facebook. The two are alleged to have indulged in six espresso martinis along with gourmet burgers, halloumi and sweet potato fries, and Biscoff cheesecake at the Lazy Fox in Dorset, United Kingdom. The couple, seen in a restaurant-released video, took an hour to eat their meal before leaving "for a cigarette," but they never came back, as per a report in the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/dine-dash-restaurant-bill-dorset-b2594354.html"><em>Independent</em></a>.</p>

<p>The restaurant claims they left quickly after the man posted images of the food and beverages on Facebook. Co-owner of Lazy Fox, Mauricio Spinola, stated that the incident took employees off guard and that if the money isn't returned, it will be a strain for his already financially challenged company.</p>

<p>"It was probably about 10 minutes after they went outside we realised they had gone. I couldn't just head out and look for him, I still had a bar to run," she said.</p>

<p>Ms Spinola continued, "It's a big hit for a small business like ours, we just can't afford to lose over 100 pounds in the current climate. We can't ask people to give us their phone or wallet when they go out for a cigarette. The vast majority of our customers are great and would think that is weird."</p>

<p>Dorset Police said that on Monday, they got a report about customers who had left the restaurant "without paying for their meal."</p>

<p>A waitress at the Lazy Fox described the duo and said that the blonde woman wore red lipstick and a white top under a white dress. She was a little drunk, and they were both a little energetic. "We were keeping a close eye on them especially when it came to serving them drinks. After they finished she said she wanted a dessert and ordered the cheesecake. The woman then stepped outside for a cigarette and the man followed her out and they never came back. We were rather busy at the time but we trusted that they weren't going to do that," she said.</p>

<p>Co-owner Enoely Fernandez also bashed the couple, calling them "silly" for boasting about their lunch on Facebook following the incident. Since the owners uploaded the embarrassing post on social media, several other restaurants have come forward, claiming they were previously fooled by the couple.</p>

<p>"The hard thing is the guy didn't look suspicious. He wasn't drunk. He wasn't shouting. He wasn't disruptive. He asked to go out for a cigarette and of course we said that was fine. It was difficult for our bar staff as we just had to reassure them that they had done nothing wrong. It's just really annoying for everyone," Ms Fernandez said.</p>

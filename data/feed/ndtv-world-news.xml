       <description><![CDATA[Wage increases are seen as undermining the regime by making people believe that inflation is rising.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Several business owners in Mynamnar have been arrested for giving their employees a raise amidst the country's soaring inflation.&nbsp;One of at least 10 arrested business owners is Pyae Phyo Zaw, whose three mobile phone shops were shut down by military government's soldiers&nbsp;he&nbsp;increased his workers' pay.&nbsp;He was also charged with inciting public unrest, according to a report by the <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/01/world/asia/myanmar-junta-inflation-arrests.html">New York Times</a>.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>A sign posted outside one of his shops declared that it was shut down due to "disrupting the peace and order of the community."</p>

<p>A legal expert explained that there is no prohibition on wage increases in the country. However, wage increases are seen as undermining the regime by making people believe that inflation is rising.&nbsp;They all potentially face three years of imprisonment.</p>

<p>One of Mr Zaw's employees anonymously said, ''We were very grateful for the salary increase, but now the shop is closed and I don't get paid. Ordinary people like us are suffering from high prices, almost to the point of despair.''</p>

<p>Critics have said it is a desperate attempt to control the narrative around the country's economic collapse as it experiences soaring inflation, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bangkokpost.com/world/2821836/myanmar-shop-owners-jailed-for-raising-wages"><em>Bangkok Post</em></a><i>&nbsp;</i>reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>''Arresting shop owners because of the increase in prices is not following any law. In Myanmar, the law exists only in name, so from a legal standpoint, everything the junta is doing is absurd,''&nbsp;said human rights lawyer U Kyee Myint.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Notably, the military's takeover in a coup in 2021 and the subsequent popular uprising against its authority have plunged the country into an economic crisis, reversing the progress made during a decade of quasi-democratic governance.</p>

<p>According to a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2024/06/12/threat-to-livelihoods-deepens-as-myanmar-economic-outlook-remains-weak">World Bank report</a>, Myanmar's economic output has shrunk by 9 per cent since 2019, and poverty has soared to levels not seen for nearly a decade. A third of the population now lives below the poverty line.</p>

<p>“Myanmar's economy post-2021 has moved on from the crisis, journeyed through chaos, and now arrives at what is surely its near collapse as a formally functioning, developing entity,” Australian economist Sean Turnell told the <em>NY Times.&nbsp;</em></p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A former Pakistan senator running in a by-election was killed on Wednesday along with four others in a targeted attack on their car near the border with Afghanistan.</p>

<p>"It appears that a remote-controlled bomb targeted the car carrying the former senator," a district police spokesman told AFP, who asked not to be named because he was not authorised to speak to the media.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"An investigation is currently underway to ascertain the type of explosives used and who was behind it. But miscreants have stepped up their activities in the region lately."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Former senator Hidayatullah Khan, his two companions and two police guards were killed in Bajaur district, just 45 kilometres (28 miles) from the Afghan border, in an area where militancy has been rising since the Taliban took control of Kabul in 2021.</p>

<p>The deadly blast took place ahead of by-elections due on July 11 in which he was running as an independent candidate.</p>

<p>In January, a candidate supporting jailed former prime minister Imran Khan was shot dead in the same district ahead of the general elections, in an attack claimed by the local chapter of the Islamic State group.</p>

<p>Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) -- a separate group from the Afghan Taliban but with a similar ideology -- and groups linked to it are the most active in the region, largely targeting security officials.&nbsp;</p>

<p>No group has claimed responsibility for Wednesday's attack, which the TTP denied involvement in.</p>

<p>Last month, the government announced the launch of a new counterterrorism operation to support armed forces in their fight against militancy.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On the ceiling of a limestone cave on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, scientists have discovered artwork depicting three human-like figures interacting with a wild pig in what they have determined is the world's oldest-known confidently dated cave painting - created at least 51,200 years ago.</p>

<p>The researchers used a new scientific approach to determine the minimum age of the newly disclosed painting inside the Leang Karampuang cave in the Maros-Pangkep region of South Sulawesi province by using a laser to date a type of crystal called calcium carbonate that formed naturally on top of the painting.</p>

<p>"The method is a significant improvement over other methods and should revolutionize rock art dating worldwide," said Maxime Aubert, a specialist in archaeological science at Griffith University in Australia and one of the leaders of the research published on Wednesday in the journal Nature.</p>

<p>The scene, dominated by a representation of a pig measuring 36 inches by 15 inches (92 cm by 38 cm) that is standing upright along with three smaller human-like figures, is painted in a single shade of dark red pigment. There are other images of pigs in the cave as well.</p>

<p>The researchers interpreted the painting as a narrative scene, which they said would make it the oldest-known evidence of storytelling in art.</p>

<p>"The three human-like figures and the pig figure were clearly not depicted in isolation in separate parts of the rock art panel," said Griffith University archeologist Adam Brumm, another of the study leaders.</p>

<p>"Rather, the juxtaposition of the figures - how they are positioned in relation to each other - and the manner in which they are interacting were clearly deliberate, and it conveys an unmistakable sense of action. There is something happening between these figures. A story is being told. Obviously, we don't know what that story was," Brumm added.</p>

<p>The researchers used the same dating method to reassess the age of another Sulawesi cave painting from a site called Leang Bulu' Sipong 4, also depicting a narrative scene, this time depicting apparent part-human, part-animal figures hunting pigs and dwarf buffalo. It turned out to be at least 48,000 years old, upwards of 4,000 years earlier than previously thought.</p>

<p>"We, as humans, define ourselves as a species that tells stories, and these are the oldest evidence of us doing that," Aubert said.</p>

<p>In the Leang Karampuang painting, the interaction between the human-like figures and the pig, a species still inhabiting the island, is somewhat cryptic.</p>

<p>"Two of these figures are holding objects of some kind, and at least one figure seems to be reaching towards the pig's face. Another figure is positioned directly above the pig's head in an upside down position," Brumm said.</p>

<p>Little is known about the people who created the Sulawesi cave paintings. Aubert said the paintings may turn out to be older than the minimum age determined by the new testing and possibly date to the first Homo sapiens wave to sweep through the region, eventually reaching Australia about 65,000 years ago, on their migration out of Africa.</p>

<p>Until now, the oldest-known cave painting was one at Leang Tedongnge cave, also in Sulawesi, from at least 45,500 years ago.</p>

<p>The Leang Karampuang painting, the researchers said, predates the cave paintings of Europe, the earliest of which is at El Castillo in Spain, dating to about 40,800 years ago.</p>

<p>There is a hand stencil painting from Spain's Maltravieso cave that some scientists have dated to around 64,000 years ago and attributed to Neanderthals. Other scientists have disputed the age of the painting and have argued that it was created by Homo sapiens.</p>

<p>"This discovery of very old cave art in Indonesia drives home the point that Europe was not the birthplace of cave art, as had long been assumed. It also suggests that storytelling was a much older part of human history, and the history of art in particular, than previously recognized," Brumm said.</p>

<p>"The earliest Sulawesi rock art is not 'simple,'" Aubert added. "It is quite advanced and shows the mental capacity of people at the time."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin told Chinese leader Xi Jinping on Wednesday that relations between Beijing and Moscow were stronger than ever before.</p>

<p>The pair met on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit in the Kazakh capital of Astana -- a regional political and economic bloc that the two leaders see as a counterweight to US "hegemony" in international affairs.</p>

<p>Putin hailed the group as "strengthening its role as one of the key pillars of a fair multipolar world order" in opening remarks of a meeting with Xi that were published on Russian state TV.</p>

<p>Alongside Russia and China, four Central Asian states, India, Iran and Pakistan are members of the SOC.</p>

<p>Beijing has become Moscow's key political and economic partner since it invaded Ukraine in February 2022, triggering a raft of Western sanctions.</p>

<p>"Russian-Chinese relations, our comprehensive partnership and strategic cooperation, are experiencing their best period in history," Putin said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In his brief opening comments, Xi called Putin his "old friend" and said Sino-Russian relations were at a "high level."</p>

<p>"In the face of the turbulent international situation and external environment, the two sides should continue to uphold the original aspiration of friendship for generations to come," Xi said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on Wednesday met UN chief Antonio Guterres and discussed global hotspots and their larger implications apart from the reform of the UNSC.</p>

<p>Mr Jaishankar, who is here to represent India at the annual summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation and carrying out various bilateral meetings on the sidelines, also met his Belarusian and Tajikistan counterparts Maksim Ryzhenkov and Sirojiddin Muhriddin respectively.</p>

<p>"Always a pleasure to meet UNSG @antonioguterres. Appreciate his insights on the state of the world. Discussed global hotspots and their larger implications," Mr Jaishankar posted on the social media platform X.</p>

<p>He further said that he spoke about the reform of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), preparations for the upcoming 'Summit of the Future' in September, and future prospects for meaningful India-UN partnership.</p>

<p>Earlier, he had bilateral meetings with his counterparts from Tajikistan, Belarus and Russia.</p>

<p>"Glad to meet Tajik FM Sirojiddin Muhriddin today in Astana. Took stock of our bilateral partnership and cooperation on multilateral forums. Appreciate the exchange of views on the regional situation," Jaishankar posted on the social media platform X along with the photos of the meeting.</p>

<p>"Pleased to meet FM Maksim Ryzhenkov of Belarus today. Welcome Belarus to the SCO as its newest member. Discussed our bilateral relationship and its future growth potential," the Minister posted earlier on X.</p>

<p>The meeting of the two Foreign Ministers came days after the first-ever India-Belarus Consular Dialogue that was held on June 28 in Minsk.</p>

<p>"The Indian delegation was led by Dr Aman Puri, JS (CPV), while the Belarusian delegation was led by Andrei Kozhan, Head of General Directorate for Consular Affairs, Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Belarus," a statement from the MEA said on Tuesday.</p>

<p>With nine member states -- India, Iran, Kazakhstan, China, Kyrgyz, Pakistan, Russia, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan - the SCO has emerged as an influential economic and security bloc and one of the largest trans-regional international organisations.</p>

<p>Belarus will be the 10th nation to join as a member.</p>

<p>Kazakhstan is hosting the summit in its capacity as the current chair of the grouping.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Delta Airlines flight was forced to make an emergency landing in New York after passengers received a meal service that was reportedly "spoiled." According to the <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/07/03/us-news/delta-flight-forced-to-make-emergency-landing-at-jfk-over-contaminated-food/">New York Post</a></em>, the A330 plane, which had 277 customers on board, left Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport just before 11 pm on Tuesday. However, it was diverted to John F. Kennedy International Airport after it was discovered that a portion of the main cabin in-flight meals were spoiled.</p>

<p>According to FlightRadar24 data, the Delta plane was over Saint Pierre and Miquelon, a French archipelago south of Canada's Newfoundland, when it was redirected. The crew reportedly decided to land the aircraft after consulting with medical experts.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the airline has not disclosed how the contamination was detected, nor have they provided information on how many of the 277 passengers consumed the meal or whether any of them exhibited symptoms of food poisoning.</p>

<p>The plane&nbsp;landed safely at JFK at 4 am on July 3.&nbsp;12 passengers were evaluated, but refused medical attention or transportation to the hospital, the Fire Department of New York told <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/airline-news/2024/07/03/delta-flight-emergency-landing-spoiled-food/74288805007/">USA Today</a>.</em></p>

<p>Delta is investigating the incident and has issued an apology to its consumers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a statement,&nbsp;Delta Airlines confirmed the incident and said, ''Delta flight 136 from Detroit to Amsterdam diverted to New York's JFK early Wednesday morning after reports that a portion of the Main Cabin in-flight meal service was spoiled.</p>

<p>Medical crews met the aircraft to treat any affected passengers and crew members. Delta's Food Safety team has engaged our suppliers to immediately isolate the product and launch a thorough investigation into the incident. This is not the service Delta is known for, and we sincerely apologize to our customers for the inconvenience and delay in their travels.''</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The UN rights chief voiced alarm Wednesday at a hardening of rhetoric, including hate speech and dehumanising language against migrants and other minorities, linked to elections in Europe and elsewhere.</p>

<p>"This is an alarm bell," Volker Turk told reporters in Geneva.</p>

<p>He warned of rising populism, hate speech and scapegoating as a record number of countries are holding elections this year.</p>

<p>While refusing to comment on specific election campaigns playing out, as crucial votes loom in Britain and France, he decried that Europe had seen "a rise of hate speech, a rise in discriminatory discourse".</p>

<p>Turk said he was "worried" listening to the rhetoric surround recent votes, including the European parliament elections last month, which handed significant gains to far-right parties.</p>

<p>"I'm always worried when I hear narratives that denigrate the other, that dehumanise the other, that make scapegoats of migrants or refugees or asylum seekers or minority groups," he said.</p>

<p>"We need to be very vigilant, because especially history tells us, in particular in Europe, that the vilification of the other, that the denigration of the other is a harbinger for worse to come."</p>

<p>Turk insisted that those in power should make it very clear: "there should be zero tolerance for all hate speech".</p>

<p>Europe was not the only place Turk said he was concerned about, pointing to scenarios playing out around the world, including around the campaigns in the United States and in India.</p>

<p>He urged voters to study the programmes of political parties to ensure they respect human rights, "and that means the human rights of everyone".</p>

<p>While criticising the populists willing to use denigration and scapegoating to win political points, Turk said mainstream parties bore responsibility too.</p>

<p>"The traditional political parties never are self-reflective about how they actually could do their job in order to respond to legitimate grievances that populations and constituencies have," he said.</p>

<p>"We need to call out the hate speech and the dehumanisation and the scapegoating and the politics of distraction," he said.</p>

<p>"But we also have to push politics to do its job better."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Moscow and the surrounding region sweltered Wednesday as temperatures soared to levels unseen in over a century, with the state weather monitor warning of dangerously hot nights.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Temperatures in the Russian capital hit 32.5 Celsius (90.5 Fahrenheit) Wednesday, beating a record established in 1917, the director of Rosgidromet weather service, Roman Vilfand, said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Vilfand told RIA Novosti news agency that in the next few nights, the temperature will not fall below 24.5 degrees, saying these "Egyptian nights" were dangerous because they did not allow people to recover from high daytime temperatures.</p>

<p>He said he expected the temperature to go down by 10 degrees in the following days, with storms and strong winds, before the heat returns next week. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Muscovites tried to cool down in public fountains and parks.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"It's very hard," 70-year-old Monira Galimova, who looked tired, told AFP as she sat at a bus stop.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We do not sleep at night... It's very difficult, especially for our age group."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Olga Kryshina, a 34-year-old working in property refurbishments, sat to cool down by a fountain near the Bolshoi Theatre.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Unlike many Muscovites who have escaped to their traditional summer "dacha" country houses, Kryshina said she had to stay in the city for work and was only "dreaming of travelling" outside of urban areas.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Abnormal temperatures "more than 7 degrees above the climatic norm" are expected until the end of the week, Rosgidromet said on its website.&nbsp;</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pakistan's anti-terrorism court in Rawalpindi has asked the government and jail administration to respond to Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf chief Imran Khan's request to meet his sons, Pakistan-based daily, The Express Tribune reported on Wednesday.</p>

<p>The former Prime Minister filed a petition seeking permission to meet his sons, Qasim and Sulaiman, in Adiala Jail.</p>

<p>In his petition, Mr Khan argued that meeting his sons is his constitutional and legal right, emphasising that the meeting would be of a familial nature.</p>

<p>"I wish to meet my sons, Qasim and Sulaiman. This is my constitutional and legal right," Mr Khan stated.</p>

<p>The court has directed the government, the Ministry of Interior, and the jail administration to provide their responses by July 5. The hearing has been adjourned until July 7.</p>

<p>The former Pakistani Prime Minister was jailed on January 30 for 10 years in a case in which he was charged with leaking state secrets. He is already serving a three-year jail term after being convicted of corruption. Imran Khan called all the charges against him politically motivated.</p>

<p>He had urged the public to "take revenge for every injustice with your vote on February 8 while remaining peaceful" in a statement released on his X (formerly Twitter) account. "Tell them that we are not sheep that can be driven with a stick," he added.</p>

<p>Former foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi, vice chairman of Imran Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party, was also sentenced to 10 years in prison by the special court set up inside Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi.</p>

<p>The case involves the alleged leaking of secret diplomatic correspondence sent by Pakistan's ambassador on Washington to Islamabad when Khan was Prime Minister.</p>

<p>It relates to his appearance at a rally in March 2022, a month before Khan was ousted from power in a parliamentary vote of no confidence. He appeared on stage, waving a piece of paper that he says showed a foreign conspiracy against him.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p data-qa="Component-Component" datatype="p">A man in China was convicted of fraud for swindling 2.6 million yuan (about Rs 3 crore) from his girlfriend by pretending to be a doctor at a prestigious hospital.&nbsp;Zhang, originally employed at a hotel, received an 11-year, six-month prison sentence and a 250,000 yuan (Rs 29,22,396) fine for his actions.</p>

<p data-qa="Component-Component" datatype="p">The court made the details of the case public in May without specifying the exact dates of the incidents. According to the <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scmp.com/news/people-culture/trending-china/article/3265279/chinese-man-poses-doctor-dupes-girlfriend-out-us360000-pair-often-meet-hospital-grounds">South China Morning Post,</a></em> Zhang initiated the deception in 2016 after meeting his girlfriend Huang, who was employed at a shopping mall.&nbsp;</p>

<p>During their six-year relationship, Zhang portrayed himself as an obstetrician-gynaecologist at a prestigious Shanghai hospital. He also claimed that he had graduated from a renowned medical school in China. He crafted a compelling image of a "successful professional," and Huang never questioned his narrative. They started dating three months after their initial meeting.</p>

<p>However, one potential warning sign was Zhang's habit of postponing Huang's requests to visit him at the hospital attributing it to a hectic schedule filled with clinical checkups or surgeries. As their relationship deepened, they frequently met for dates on the hospital lawn.</p>

<p>By November 2016, however, Zhang developed a gambling addiction and accrued significant debts. He started taking money from Huang in the name of home investment and spent it on gambling and paying off his debts.&nbsp;During their relationship, Huang transferred more than 2.6 million yuan to Zhang.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Huang's family grew concerned as Zhang began avoiding repayment of the money. Eventually, Huang, frustrated with the situation, verified Zhang's employment with the hospital, only to find out that he was not employed there.</p>

<p data-qa="Component-Component" datatype="p">During the trial, the prosecutor said: ''While love is beautiful, one must also be wary of sweet traps''.</p>

<p data-qa="Component-Component" datatype="p">Many social media users sympathised with Huang after details of the case went viral on social media. One user wrote, ''She was too blinded by love.''</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Britain will hold a parliamentary election on July 4 which opinion polls indicate will hand power to Keir Starmer's Labour Party and end 14 years of Conservative Party-led government.</p>

<p><strong>HOW IS THE WINNER DECIDED?</strong></p>

<p>To win outright, one party needs to win at least 326 out of the 650 parliamentary seats. The leader of that party becomes prime minister.</p>

<p>In each of the 650 constituencies, voters elect a local candidate who is usually affiliated with a larger political party. Voters choose one candidate and the candidate with the most votes wins the seat.</p>

<p>A hung parliament occurs if no single party wins a majority. In this case the incumbent prime minister remains in power and is given the first chance to form a government either by building a coalition or governing with a minority.</p>

<p><strong>WHAT IS A SUPERMAJORITY?</strong></p>

<p>During the Conservative Party's campaign, it warned that Labour could win a 'supermajority' that would embolden it to make more radical reforms than those set out in its manifesto.</p>

<p>In some democracies, a supermajority is a legally defined threshold, higher than a simple majority, required to make major changes such as to a constitution.</p>

<p>In Britain, however, there is no definition of a supermajority that gives governments any special powers and the term has no clear meaning in its political lexicon.</p>

<p><strong>WHEN WILL THE RESULTS BE ANNOUNCED?</strong></p>

<p>An exit poll is released by broadcasters immediately after voting ends at 10 p.m. (2100 GMT).</p>

<p>Vote counting begins immediately and first results come within hours. Most are declared overnight and the outcome is usually clear between 5 a.m. and 7 a.m.</p>

<p><strong>WHEN WILL THE NEW PRIME MINISTER TAKE OFFICE?</strong></p>

<p>Once the overall result is clear, and if the governing party has lost, the prime minister would be expected to tender his resignation to the king on Friday.</p>

<p>The leader of the winning party will then meet the king, who will request he or she form a government. They will then head to Downing Street to make a speech to the British public as the new prime minister.</p>

<p><strong>WHAT HAPPENS ONCE A NEW PRIME MINISTER IS IN PLACE?</strong></p>

<p>The new prime minister will begin appointing ministers, starting with senior positions.</p>

<p>Parliament is scheduled to return on July 9. The Speaker of the House of Commons - parliament's lower chamber - will be elected from among members of parliament (MPs).</p>

<p>Each MP will then in turn swear the oath of allegiance to the king or make a solemn affirmation. This usually takes a few days.</p>

<p>The State Opening of Parliament and King's Speech, setting out a government's programme of legislation for the parliamentary session, is due to take place on July 17, although this date could be changed by a new government.</p>

<p><strong>WHO CAN VOTE AND HOW?</strong></p>

<p>Voters must be aged 18 or over on polling day, and be either a British citizen, Irish citizen or qualifying Commonwealth citizen.</p>

<p>Close to 50 million people are registered to vote. Polling stations open from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. (0600-2100 GMT). Votes can be cast in person, by post, or through a proxy.</p>

<p>Voters must take photo I.D. with them to vote, the first national election at which that has been required.</p>

<p>Overseas British citizens will also get to vote regardless of how long they have been living outside the country.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Stop Labour's "supermajority" is the final message UK PM Rishi Sunak is trying to drive home on Wednesday, the final day of campaigning ahead of polling day on Thursday]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Stop Labour's "supermajority" is the final message British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is trying to drive home on Wednesday, the final day of campaigning ahead of polling day on Thursday, as most of the incumbent Conservatives seem to have all but conceded defeat in the general election.</p>

<p>"This is what unites us. We need to stop the Labour supermajority that will put up your taxes. The only way to do that is to vote Conservative tomorrow," said 44-year-old Rishi Sunak on social media, as he focused on drumming up support in the last few hours of the campaign trail.</p>

<p>With his party trailing far behind the Keir Starmer-led Labour Party, the British Indian leader and his team's strategy seems to be to canvas their traditional voters to ensure a strong enough turnout in the polls on Thursday and narrow the gap of their widely expected defeat after Tory victories in the last three elections.</p>

<p>"I totally accept where the polls are at the moment means that tomorrow is likely to see the largest Labour landslide majority - the largest majority that this country has ever seen. Much bigger than 1997," Rishi Sunak's Work and Pensions Secretary Mel Stride told the BBC.</p>

<p>"I have accepted that where the polls are at the moment... that we are therefore tomorrow highly likely to be in a situation where [Labour has] the largest majority that any party has ever achieved," he said, effectively conceding his party's defeat.</p>

<p>It is being seen as a fear tactic to jolt Tory voters into action, with the hope of keeping the Labour majority under that won by former prime minister Tony Blair led Labour Party in 1997 of 179 seats.</p>

<p>"Thursday's vote is now all about forming a strong enough Opposition. One needs to read the writing on the wall: it's over, and we need to prepare for the reality and frustration of the Opposition," Suella Braverman, sacked as home secretary by Rishi Sunak, told 'The Telegraph'.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, former prime minister Boris Johnson - not exactly a close ally of Rishi Sunak ever since the partygate scandal of COVID pandemic law-breaking parties - was also rolled out by the party at a campaign event in London to warn against a "sledgehammer majority" being handed to the Keir Starmer led Labour Party.</p>

<p>"When Rishi asked me to come and help, of course I couldn't say no. We're all here because we love our country," Boris Johnson told a cheering Tory crowd.</p>

<p>"They can achieve nothing in this election except to usher in the most left-wing Labour government since the war with a huge majority, and we must not let it happen," he warned.</p>

<p>The Labour Party, meanwhile, is keen to override this message of victory as a foregone conclusion a day before the polls to fight against any complacency within the ranks and among its own voter base.</p>

<p>"People are saying the polls predict the future - they don't predict the future, every single vote counts, every single vote has to be earned... It isn't 'job done'," said Keir Starmer.</p>

<p>Polling experts have forecast a low turnout, which stood at 67 per cent in the last general election in December 2019 when Boris Johnson won a solid majority on his "get Brexit done" message.</p>

<p>On Thursday, polling booths will open across the country at 7am local time and close at 10pm local time as voters elect their MPs for the UK Parliament's 650 constituencies - with 326 required for a majority and to avert a hung Parliament.</p>

<p>All eyes will then be on the election night exit poll at 10pm, which gives a fair snapshot of what can be expected nationally as the counting commences and centres up and down the UK. If opinion polls are to be believed, the incumbent Tories are in line to win anywhere between 53 and 150 seats, with Labour projected to win a landslide.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here are some key issues at stake in the UK general election on Thursday:</p>

<p><strong>- Will jaded voters turn out? -</strong></p>

<p>The main opposition Labour party is widely predicted to win and has been determined not to take any risks, making for a lacklustre election campaign.</p>

<p>For the past two years, polling has suggested that Labour is 20 points ahead of the Conservatives, and no amount of campaigning has managed to shift the dial.</p>

<p>But if that indicates a desire for change after 14 years of Tory government, there does not appear to be much enthusiasm for Labour's plans.</p>

<p>Indeed, Labour has repeatedly warned that it does not have a "magic wand" to change the country overnight.</p>

<p>The apathy extends to both leaders, with 72 percent having an unfavourable opinion of Tory leader Rishi Sunak and 51 percent of Labour's Keir Starmer, according to a YouGov poll this month.</p>

<p>That has prompted questions about whether voters will turn out in large numbers spurred on by the promise of change or remain at home jaded by years of chaos and no great love for party leaders.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Labour figures have made no secret of their concerns surrounding voter apathy, with dozens of seats closely contested and up for grabs.</p>

<p>Turnout (67.3 percent in 2019) will provide an indicator of voters' distrust of their political class, and a challenge for the next government.</p>

<p><strong>- Lucky number eight for Farage? -</strong></p>

<p>An unexpected addition to the campaign, Nigel Farage -- the Brexit figurehead who has now become the spokesperson of hard-right, anti-immigration views -- entered the race as the leader of Reform UK.</p>

<p>Despite a surge in the polls, the UK's first-past-the-post system makes outright victory for the 60-year-old former European parliamentarian and his party unlikely.</p>

<p>If he succeeds at his eighth attempt to get a seat in parliament as the MP for Clacton-on-Sea in east England, Farage -- a Donald Trump ally -- will have even more visibility.</p>

<p>If he fails, his startup Reform UK party, currently polling around 19 percent, would still play a decisive role in the race between the Tories and Labour in several constituencies.</p>

<p><strong>- Tory wipeout? -</strong></p>

<p>Several polls suggest the party of Winston Churchill, Margaret Thatcher and Boris Johnson will win fewer seats than the 141 it secured in 1906, in what would be the worst result since its creation in 1834.</p>

<p>Speculation has already started about who would succeed Rishi Sunak to lead the fragmented party.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It remains to be seen how many big names will save their seats and what direction the party, which was centrist under David Cameron (2010-2015) and then drifted to the right, can take.</p>

<p>In the event of Reform's success, some Tories would not object to an alliance.</p>

<p><strong>- Weakened Scottish nationalists? -</strong></p>

<p>Nothing seems to be going right for the Scottish National Party (SNP), which has dominated the devolved nation's politics for the last 15 years.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The surprise resignation of charismatic first minister Nicola Sturgeon in 2023 destabilised the party. Her successor Humza Yousaf only lasted a year.</p>

<p>The left-wing party is still the target of a probe into its finances in which Sturgeon's husband was implicated and does not have a viable strategy to deliver independence, a fight that was revived by Brexit but blocked by London.</p>

<p>First Minister John Swinney insists that winning in a majority of Scotland's 59 UK parliamentary constituencies would be a green light for him to launch fresh negotiations on another referendum with the new government in London.</p>

<p>The SNP currently holds 43 seats. But Labour looks set to use its national momentum to reassert its dominance in Scotland. July 4 promises to be the first electoral test for the pro-independent movement's difficulties.</p>

<p><strong>- Return of the Lib Dems? -</strong></p>

<p>Ed Davey has run an offbeat campaign, gliding down a waterslide, falling off a paddleboard, roasting marshmallows, building sandcastles, bungee jumping and even Zumba dancing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>His stunts and policies alike have set out to carve a niche for his Liberal Democrat party while Sunak and Starmer duel, Farage returns and Labour moves back to the centre ground.</p>

<p>The Lib Dems' rise to around 12 percent in polls and their strong presence in southern England could win them up to 67 seats, according to one YouGov poll, up from 11 in 2019.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Such a victory would be comparable to the party's breakthrough in 2010, when it governed with the Conservatives, and would give strength to its pro-European and climate-centred policies.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 20-year-old Indiana man has been charged with strangling his mother to death after she asked him to clean his room and find a full-time job. Connor Kobold, a student at the United States Merchant Marine Academy, called 911 five times on February 5, reporting a dead person in his home in Valparaiso, as per court documents, according to Fox News.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
When police arrived, Kobold surrendered himself, asking to be handcuffed and placed in the squad car. He allegedly confessed to the crime, stating, "There is a dead person inside of the house on the corner" and "I killed somebody in that house," reported WGNTV.<br />
<br />
Officers also noticed superficial scratches on his face.<br />
<br />
When police entered the house, they found his mother, Shanelle Burns, 43, unconscious with “no pulse” and “severe injuries”, including ligature marks on her neck.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Ms Burns, an assistant vice president in advancement at Loyola University in Chicago, was hospitalised but died two days later.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
According to court documents, she died of "asphyxiation” and her death was ruled a homicide by “manual strangulation”. Doctors reported the woman had suffered significant brain damage before her death.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The 20-year-old has now been charged with her murder. He has pleaded not guilty and is being held without bond at Porter County Jail, with a court appearance scheduled for next month.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Earlier, during a February hearing, Kobold, who has a history of mental health issues, told a judge that he had been admitted to two facilities and had seen at least five therapists. He attempted to represent himself in court, stating that only he could explain the circumstances surrounding the incident; no one else could. However, a public defender was appointed to represent him despite his efforts to self-represent.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The UK general election is expected to deliver the most diverse Parliament in the country's history, including in the number of parliamentarians of Indian heritage likely to be elected from across the nation.</p>

<p>According to an analysis by the British Future think tank, the Labour Party is set to have by far the largest number of ethnic minority MPs if the party wins an overall majority and even more in a landslide scenario.</p>

<p>With around 14 per cent of MPs coming from an ethnic minority background this time, the analysis finds that the new Parliament will be closer than ever to reflecting the diversity of the British electorate.</p>

<p>"This election will see the biggest rise in ethnic minority representation and the most diverse Parliament ever," said Sunder Katwala, Director of British Future.</p>

<p>"In the space of 40 years, we'll have gone from zero to one in seven MPs being from an ethnic minority background. Britain is closing the gap between the diversity of Parliament and the electorate much faster than anyone thought possible," he said.</p>

<p>The last general election in 2019 resulted in 15 MPs of Indian heritage crossing over the line, many of whom are contesting again alongside several first-timers.</p>

<p>Conservative Party MP Alok Sharma and Labour veteran Virendra Sharma are among the most high-profile British Indians not seeking re-election this time, from Reading West and Ealing Southall, respectively.</p>

<p>The latter constituency, with a large Punjabi electorate, has two British Sikh candidates contesting as Independents - Sangeet Kaur Bhail and Jaginder Singh.</p>

<p>Some of the key British Indian candidates to watch in Thursday's polls include Praful Nargund, who is contesting for the Labour Party in Islington North – the seat of the party's now-suspended former leader Jeremy Corbyn, who is contesting as an Independent candidate.</p>

<p>Jas Athwal is contesting in another Labour stronghold of Iford South, while Baggy Shanker in Derby South, Satvir Kaur in Southampton Test, and Harpreet Uppal in Huddersfield are contesting more marginal seats for the party.</p>

<p>Rajesh Agrawal, the Indore-born former Deputy Mayor of London for Business, is fighting to become a first-time MP from Leicester East and is up against a fellow British Indian Conservative candidate, Shivani Raja.</p>

<p>This constituency, representing a large Indian heritage electorate, will be keenly watched as its former long-term Goan-origin MP, Keith Vaz, is also in the race.</p>

<p>British-Indian Sikhs, including solicitor Warinder Juss from Wolverhampton West in central England and Gurinder Singh Josan from Smethwick, will be hoping to make gains for Labour, as will Bihar-born Kanishka Narayan contesting in Vale of Glamorgan - hoping to be elected as the first Indian-origin MP from Wales, and Sonia Kumar hoping to overturn a Tory majority in Dudley.</p>

<p>For the Conservative Party, Chandra Kanneganti in Stoke-on-Trent Central and Ameet Jogia in Hendon are facing a tough fight in a race consistently forecast in favour of the Opposition Labour Party.</p>

<p>"A diverse parliament brings different perspectives to its work, which can lead to more effective policy-making. MPs who come from different backgrounds can be role models for their communities, inspiring young people to vote and get involved in politics," says Jill Rutter, British Future Associate Fellow who led the think tank's analysis.</p>

<p>Of the sitting MPs, the British Indians most vulnerable to a Labour swing in the election include Tory MPs Shailesh Vara from North West Cambridgeshire, Gagan Mohindra from South West Hertfordshire and Claire Coutinho from East Surrey.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is expected to hold on to his seat of Richmond and Northallerton in northern England, as are former Cabinet colleagues Priti Patel in Witham in Essex and Suella Braverman in Fareham and Waterlooville.</p>

<p>With a series of retirements and exits, largely from the incumbent Tories, the new Parliament elected on Friday will see around 158 new MPs in the House of Commons.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After finishing a half-marathon, a fit and healthy social media professional and marathoner received a cancer diagnosis. He has now disclosed the three significant warning signs he missed, according to <em>News.com.au.</em></p>

<p>Bondi-based 38-year-old Govind Sandhu, who oversees Global Music Partnerships at TikTok Australia, was diagnosed with stage four non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in early May after experiencing severe complications after the Sydney Half Marathon, as per the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/health/health-problems/tiktok-australias-head-of-global-music-partnerships-shared-shock-cancer-diagnosis/news-story/a45621c5f117280142af21ef9a685c96">news outlet.</a></p>

<p>The 38-year-old runner took to Instagram to share his story and the warning signs that led to his eventual examination.</p>

<p>"The day after that I just went downhill (with a) swollen knee, although I thought that was because my knee was injured from a stack when I was in Hobart running some trails," he said in an emotional Instagram video posted on Wednesday.</p>

<p>"(I had) really bad body aches and sweat, and everything that would make you think it was the flu, or Covid. And after a four week period I just deteriorated."</p>

<p>"Firstly, it's important to remember that I'm talking about non-Hodgkins lymphoma and that I'm not an expert. Secondly, I would encourage you to speak to your doctor about warning signs, but also be proactive and get your blood checked at least twice a year," he suggested to his followers.</p>

<p>"Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is a type of cancer that begins in your lymphatic system, which is part of the body's germ-fighting immune system," the Mayo Clinic explains. "In non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, white blood cells called lymphocytes grow abnormally and can form growths (tumours) throughout the body."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Japan's top court ruled on Wednesday that a defunct eugenics law under which thousands of people were forcibly sterilised between 1948 and 1996 was unconstitutional, local media reported.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court also ruled that a 20-year statute of limitations on compensation claims could not be applied, a major victory for victims who have endured decades of suffering.</p>

<p>Japan's government acknowledges that around 16,500 people were forcibly sterilised under the eugenics law that was in place between 1948 and 1996.</p>

<p>The law allowed doctors to sterilise people with inheritable intellectual disabilities to "prevent the generation of poor quality descendants".</p>

<p>Another 8,500 people were sterilised with their consent, according to authorities, although lawyers say even those cases were likely "de facto forced" because of the pressure individuals faced.</p>

<p>A 1953 government notice said physical restraint, anaesthesia, and even "deception" could be used for the operations.</p>

<p>"I've spent an agonising 66 years because of the government surgery. I want my life back that I was robbed of," victim Saburo Kita, who uses a pseudonym, said before Wednesday's ruling.</p>

<p>Kita was convinced to undergo a vasectomy when he was 14 at a facility housing troubled children. He only confided what had happened to his wife shortly before she died in 2013.</p>

<p>"Only when the government faces up to what it did and takes responsibility will I be able to accept my life, even just a little," Kita, now 81, told a news conference last year.</p>

<h3><strong>Apology&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>The number of operations in Japan slowed to a trickle in the 1980s and 1990s before the law was scrapped in 1996.</p>

<p>That dark history was thrust back under the spotlight in 2018 when a woman in her 60s sued the government over a procedure she had undergone at age 15, opening the floodgates for similar lawsuits.</p>

<p>The government, for its part, "wholeheartedly" apologised after legislation was passed in 2019 stipulating a lump-sum payment of 3.2 million yen (around $20,000 today) per victim.</p>

<p>However, survivors say that was too little to match the severity of their suffering and took their fight to court.</p>

<p>Regional courts have mostly agreed in recent years that the eugenics law constituted a violation of Japan's constitution.</p>

<p>However, judges have been divided on whether claims are valid beyond the 20-year statute of limitations.</p>

<p>Some have said that applying such limitations was extremely cruel and unfair, ordering the state to pay damages. But others dismissed cases, saying the window for pursuing damages had closed.</p>

<p>"The ruling will hopefully pave the way for active steps to be taken by the government to eliminate the kind of eugenic mentality that it created," Kita's lawyer, Naoto Sekiya, told AFP before Wednesday's ruling.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A woman was found dead inside the belly of a snake after it swallowed her whole in central Indonesia, police said Wednesday, the second python killing in the province in a month.</p>

<p>Siriati, 36, had gone missing after she left her house Tuesday morning to buy medicine for her sick child, police said, prompting relatives to launch a search.</p>

<p>Her husband Adiansa, 30, found her slippers and pants on the ground about 500 metres (yards) from their house in Siteba village, South Sulawesi province.</p>

<p>"Shortly after that, he spotted a snake, about 10 metres from the path. The snake was still alive," local police chief Idul, who like many Indonesians has one name, told AFP.</p>

<p>Village secretary Iyang told AFP that Adiansa became suspicious after he noticed the python's "very large" belly. He called the villagers to help cut open its stomach, where they found her body.</p>

<p>Such incidents are considered extremely rare, but several people have been swallowed by pythons in recent years.</p>

<p>A woman was found dead last month inside the belly of a reticulated python in another district of South Sulawesi.</p>

<p>Last year residents in the province killed an eight-metre python, which was found strangling and eating one of the farmers in a village.</p>

<p>A 54-year-old woman was found dead in 2018 inside a seven-metre python in Southeast Sulawesi's Muna town.</p>

<p>The year before, a farmer in West Sulawesi went missing before being found being swallowed by a four-metre python at a palm oil plantation.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

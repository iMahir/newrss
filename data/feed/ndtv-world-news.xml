       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A reactor at the Onagawa nuclear plant in Miyagi Prefecture, northeastern Japan, has resumed power generation for the first time since the Fukushima nuclear disaster in March 2011, its operator said.</p>

<p>Tohoku Electric Power Company said that the Onagawa No. 2 reactor restarted power generation at 6 p.m. local time on Friday. After an adjustment operation to check for any abnormalities while gradually increasing output, the reactor will be temporarily halted for equipment checks, reports Xinhua news agency.</p>

<p>The reactor is expected to start full commercial operation in December, it added.</p>

<p>The 825,000-kilowatt reactor, if operated at about 70 per cent of its capacity for one year, is estimated to generate electricity equivalent to the power consumption of 1.62 million households, according to Tohoku Electric.</p>

<p>The No. 2 reactor was reactivated on October 29 but was halted on November 4 after an issue was found with a measurement device. After the problem was fixed, the reactor was restarted again on Wednesday.</p>

<p>The three reactors at the Onagawa plant are of the same boiling water type as those at Tokyo Electric Power Company's Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, where the country's worst nuclear accident was triggered by the massive earthquake and tsunami on March 11, 2011.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russia is solely responsible for preventing a fair settlement to end the war in Ukraine, the G7 said on Saturday, in a statement marking 1,000 days of the Russian invasion.</p>

<p>"Russia remains the sole obstacle to just and lasting peace," the Group of Seven industrialised nations, of which Italy holds the rotating presidency, said in a statement.</p>

<p>The G7, which also comprises Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Japan and the United States, confirmed "its commitment to imposing severe costs on Russia through sanctions, export controls and other effective measures".</p>

<p>It expressed "unwavering support for Ukraine for as long as it takes", adding: "We stand in solidarity contributing to its fight for sovereignty, freedom, independence, territorial integrity and its reconstruction. We recognise, too, the impact of Russia's aggression on vulnerable people across the world."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Saturday he would like to end the war with Russia next year through "diplomatic means".</p>

<p>He spoke a day after saying he expected the conflict to end sooner than it would otherwise have done, once Donald Trump takes office in the United States next year.</p>

<p>"For our part, we must do everything we can to ensure that this war ends next year. We have to end it by diplomatic means," Zelensky said in an interview with Ukrainian radio. "And this, I think, is very important."</p>

<p>There have been no meaningful talks between Russia and Ukraine, but a Trump presidency raises questions about the future of the conflict, with the Republican repeatedly saying he would end the war swiftly.</p>

<p>"We have to understand what the Russians want," Zelensky said.</p>

<p>Referring to Ukraine, he said: "You are at war with a state that does not value its people, that has a lot of equipment, that does not care how many people die."</p>

<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has said he will only accept talks with Ukraine if Kyiv surrenders Ukrainian territory that Moscow occupies.</p>

<p>The Kremlin said he repeated that demand in a phone conversation with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Friday.</p>

<p>Zelensky has rejected Putin's conditions.</p>

<p>Moscow has made steady advances in eastern Ukraine since this summer, inching closer to key hubs such as Pokrovsk and Kurakhove.</p>

<p>Zelensky said on Saturday that Russian forces were suffering heavy losses and that the adance had "slowed down" in some areas.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Boeing has laid off more than 400 members of its professional aerospace labour union, the union has revealed.</p>

<p>As of Thursday evening, Boeing had sent layoff notices to 438 union members of the Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace. The union's local chapter has 17,000 Boeing employees who are largely based in Washington state, with some in states of Oregon, California and Utah.</p>

<p>The job cuts are part of a company-wide 10 per cent reduction in labour, which involves about 17,000 jobs across Boeing's commercial, defence and global services division, Xinhua news agency reported.</p>

<p>The company announced the job cuts in October and began notifying those workers who will be impacted on Wednesday, the union said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Joe Biden meets Chinese president Xi Jinping for the last time as US president on Saturday, but the leaders' goal of lowering tensions before Donald Trump's inauguration is challenged by fresh conflicts over cyber crime, trade, Taiwan and Russia.</p>

<p>Biden and Xi will huddle on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Lima, Peru -- for their first talks in seven months -- where Pacific Rim leaders are assessing the implications of Trump's return to power as US president on Jan. 20. The time of their meeting has not been disclosed.</p>

<p>Washington is incensed by a recent China-linked hack of the telephone communications of US government and presidential campaign officials, and it is anxious about increasing pressure by Beijing on Taiwan and Chinese support for Russia.</p>

<p>Taiwan President Lai Ching-te is planning to stop in the US state of Hawaii and maybe Guam on a sensitive visit that is sure to anger Beijing in the coming weeks, Reuters reported on Friday. China views democratically governed Taiwan as its own territory. The US is Taiwan's most important international backer and arms supplier, despite the lack of formal diplomatic recognition.</p>

<p>At the same time, Beijing's economy is taking a stiff hit from Biden's steps on trade, including a plan to restrict US investment in Chinese artificial intelligence, quantum computing and semiconductors and export restrictions on high-end computer chips. All of those topics are expected to figure into the talks, US officials said.</p>

<p>China routinely denies US hacking allegations, regards Taiwan as internal matter and has protested American statements on Sino-Russian trade. A spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington declined to comment.</p>

<p><strong>BLANKET TARIFFS</strong></p>

<p>Trump has vowed to adopt blanket 60% tariffs on US imports of Chinese goods as part of a package of "America First" trade measures. Beijing opposes those steps. The Republican president-elect also plans to hire several hawkish voices on China in senior roles, including US Senator Marco Rubio as secretary of state and Representative Mike Waltz as national security adviser.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, Biden national security adviser Jake Sullivan described the transition as "a time when competitors and adversaries can see possibly opportunity." Biden will stress with Xi the "need to maintain stability, clarity, predictability through this transition between the United States and China."</p>

<p>Shen Dingli, a Shanghai-based international relations scholar, said China wants the meeting to ease tensions during the transition period. "China definitely does not want relations with the United States to be thrown into turmoil before Trump formally takes office," said Shen.</p>

<p>The summit in South America offers new signs of the challenges to the United States' power in its own backyard, where China is on a charm offensive.</p>

<p>Xi, who arrived in Lima on Thursday, plans a week-long diplomatic blitz in Latin America that includes a refurbished free-trade agreement with Peru, inaugurating the massive Chancay deep-water port there and being welcomed in Brazil's capital next week for a state visit.</p>

<p>China is seeking Latin America's metal ores, soybeans, and other commodities, but US officials worry they may also be looking for new US-adjacent military and intelligence outposts. Chinese state-backed media has called those accusations a smear.</p>

<p>A US official said Washington's commitment to the region was strong and that Chinese infrastructure investment overseas has declined in recent years due to domestic challenges and problems with the projects.</p>

<p>But Ryan Berg, director of the Americas Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank, said Xi would meet with a good reception in the region.</p>

<p>"Biden's trip will be overshadowed very clearly by all of the things that Xi Jinping will be up to when he visits APEC," he said. "When Xi meets with Biden part of his audience is not - it's not solely the White House or the US government. It's about American CEOs and continued US investment or trying to renew US investment in China and get rid of the perception that there's a hostile business environment in China."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">A 20-year-old US man is facing severe charges after allegedly throwing his eight-month-old son against a wall in frustration while playing a video game. Jalin White is charged with physical abuse of a child and neglect causing great bodily harm following the incident on November 5, <a href="https://www.fox6now.com/news/milwaukee-man-accused-throwing-baby-while-playing-video-game" rel="nofollow,noindex">Fox News</a> reported.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">According to <a href="https://fox11online.com/news/state/baby-severely-injured-after-being-thrown-by-milwaukee-man-while-playing-video-games-jalin-white-childrens-wisconsin-hospital-pulse-skull-fracture-hemorrahage-abuse-brain-injury " rel="nofollow,noindex">court documents</a>, police were called to Children's Wisconsin hospital to investigate after the child was admitted with life-threatening injuries. Prosecutors said that the child, who suffered extensive injuries, is not expected to survive.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Medical professionals reported that the infant had a large skull fracture, brain haemorrhage, and multiple rib and clavicle fractures at various stages of healing. A craniectomy was performed to relieve pressure on the baby's brain, but the prognosis remains grim.</p>

<p dir="ltr">“This is likely going to become a homicide,” said Milwaukee Assistant District Attorney Madeline Witte during White's court appearance. “This is a severe level of violence for an innocent infant child, which had multiple injuries,” as per <a href="https://www.live5news.com/2024/11/13/father-allegedly-threw-infant-against-wall-after-becoming-frustrated-with-video-game/ " rel="nofollow,noindex">Live5 News</a>.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The criminal complaint outlines that White admitted to throwing the child during an intense gaming session of ‘NBA 2K'. Jalin White told investigators he was losing the game and became frustrated.</p>

<p dir="ltr">“He was getting heavy in my arms,” White said, according to the complaint, before describing how he threw the baby against a wall and onto a bed. The child struck the wall about a foot above the bed and landed face-first.</p>

<p dir="ltr">“I heard the wall. It was hard on his head. It was hard. It was a loud, hard wall,” White confessed to detectives.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Prosecutors revealed that the child's rib injuries suggest prior abuse, indicating this was not an isolated incident.</p>

<p dir="ltr">“If the child does die, prosecutors will upgrade the charges to homicide,” attorney Witte confirmed. If convicted of the current charges, Jalin White faces up to 62 years in prison, a sentence that could increase with a homicide conviction.</p>

<p dir="ltr">During the hearing, White shook his head as the court commissioner outlined the allegations and evidence, ordering his $100,000 cash bail.</p>

<p dir="ltr">“This incident reflects a tragic and senseless act of violence against a vulnerable infant,” the court commissioner added.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Authorities are monitoring the child's condition. White is being held on a $100,000 cash bond.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iran's foreign ministry spokesman on Saturday "categorically" denied The New York Times report on Tehran's ambassador to the United Nations meeting with US tech billionaire Elon Musk, state media reported.</p>

<p>In an interview with state news agency IRNA, spokesman Esmaeil Baghaei was reported as "categorically denying such a meeting" and expressing "surprise at the coverage of the American media in this regard".</p>

<p>The Times reported on Friday that Musk, who is a close ally of President-elect Donald Trump, met earlier this week with Iran's ambassador to the UN, Amir Saeid Iravani.</p>

<p>It cited anonymous Iranian sources describing the encounter as "positive".</p>

<p>Iranian newspapers, particularly those aligned with the reformist party that supports President Masoud Pezeshkian, largely described the meeting in positive terms before Baghaei's statement.</p>

<p>In the weeks leading up to Trump's re-election, Iranian officials have signalled a willingness to resolve issues with the West.</p>

<p>Iran and the United Stated cut diplomatic ties shortly after the 1979 Islamic revolution that toppled the US-backed shah of Iran, Mohammed Reza Pahlavi.</p>

<p>Since then, both countries have communicated through the Swiss embassy in Tehran and the Sultanate of Oman.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In late October, Israel launched an attack on Iran's Parchin military complex, an active top secret nuclear weapons lab, specifically targeting the Taleghan 2 facility, a site previously believed to be inactive.</p>

<p>This bold move has significantly damaged Iran's efforts to revive its nuclear weapons research, which had been secretly ongoing since last year. The strike destroyed sophisticated equipment used to design plastic explosives that surround uranium in a nuclear device, a crucial component for detonation.</p>

<p>Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi vehemently denies the country's pursuit of nuclear weapons, stating, "Iran is not after nuclear weapons, period." However, Israeli and US officials reveal a different story.</p>

<p>According to a report by <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.axios.com/2024/11/15/iran-israel-destroyed-active-nuclear-weapons-research-facility" rel="noindex,nofollow">Axios</a>, The Taleghan 2 facility was once part of Iran's Amad nuclear weapons program, halted in 2003, but recent activity suggested a resurgence of nuclear ambitions. High-resolution satellite imagery confirms the complete destruction of the Taleghan 2 building.</p>

<p>The Israeli strike was preceded by warnings from the White House to Iran about suspicious research activities detected by Israeli and US intelligence. These warnings fell on deaf ears, prompting concerns "across the board" about Iran's intentions. The US Director of National Intelligence (DNI) even reassessed Iran's nuclear program in light of these findings.</p>

<h2><strong>Implications of the Israeli strike</strong></h2>

<p>The incoming Trump administration's hawkish stance on Iran may lead to heightened tensions and stricter sanctions.</p>

<p>The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) board of governors is expected to vote on a censure resolution against Iran for its lack of cooperation.</p>

<p>Iran's secret nuclear activities at Taleghan 2, not part of its declared program, raise questions about its commitment to the treaty.</p>

<p>The strike may escalate tensions between Israel and Iran, potentially destabilising West Asia.</p>

<p>As the IAEA meets to discuss Iran's cooperation, the international community watches with bated breath. Will Iran limit its cooperation with the IAEA, or will it negotiate with European powers on its peaceful nuclear program? The aftermath of the Israeli strike has opened a Pandora's box, and the world awaits Iran's next move.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Disenchanted by the Democratic Party's use of human rights as a political tool for countries such as India, and encouraged by Donald Trump's stance on Hindu rights in Bangladesh, about 70 per cent of Hindu-Americans voted for the Republican presidential candidate in the November 5 elections, an eminent community leader has said.</p>

<p>"The Democratic Party has not really done much to court Indian Americans. Not only that, they have done things which are very insulting, infuriating, and humiliating to Indian Americans... When it comes specifically to India-related issues, number one, the Democrats, somehow or other, use human rights as a political tool," influential Indian American Dr Bharat Barai told PTI in an interview.</p>

<p>Barai pointed out that there was little to no condemnation of the violence against Hindus in Bangladesh - where over 100 Hindus were killed, temples desecrated, and people forced to wear hijabs - by President Joe Biden, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, or Vice President Kamala Harris.</p>

<p>He explained that, while the Hindu American population is small, they are a significant voting bloc, particularly in tight races. "I believe 70 percent of Hindu Americans voted for Trump this time," he said.</p>

<p>Barai, who was in Washington DC this week to attend the Diwali celebrations at the US Capitol, said, "Trump got the benefit of doubt, partly based on his strong statement about Bangladeshi Hindus. But of course, people will judge Trump by what he does (after coming to office)."</p>

<p>He also noted that Trump's appointments of two Hindu Americans -- Vivek Ramaswamy and Tulsi Gabbard -- to prominent positions has boosted his support within the community.</p>

<p>Barai exuded confidence that India US relationship would strengthen under the next administration, mainly because of the personal relationship between Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi.</p>

<p>The two leader share a "special bond", which was evident during Trump's visit to India when he was given a "tumultuous welcome" at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad, the Hindu American said, hoping that this relationship will likely grow stronger.</p>

<p>"Trump did not try to cross India or needle India when he was the president. He was the one who had sort of turbocharged the process of Quad and now that will go even further because all the four countries, United States, Japan, Australia and India realise that China is becoming too aggressive in the Indo-Pacific region. All the four countries feel if they stay together, they will be able to counter China better," he said.</p>

<p>Barai noted that in the recent election, Hindu Americans played a key role in Trump's success, particularly in swing states like Georgia, Pennsylvania, and Michigan.</p>

<p>"His margin in Georgia swelled over 180,000. I would say he owes 100,000 of those votes to Hindu Americans. His last statement about Bangladeshi Hindus, I think that won people over," he added.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Prime Minister Narendra Modi left for his five-day visit to Nigeria, Brazil, and Guyana. He will be on his three-nation tour from November 16 to 21, where he will be attending the G20 Summit in Brazil.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday said he is looking forward to "meaningful" discussions at the upcoming G20 summit in Brazil that built upon its agenda for the grouping on India's presidency of the bloc last year.</p>

<p>Modi made the comments in a statement ahead of his five day visit to Nigeria, Brazil and Guyana.</p>

<p>The prime minister's first destination will be Nigeria from where he will travel to Brazil.</p>

<p>"In Brazil, I will attend the 19th G-20 Summit as a troika member. Last year, India's successful presidency elevated the G-20 to people's G-20 and mainstreamed the priorities of the Global South into its agenda," the prime minister said.</p>

<p>Modi, Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Joe Biden will be among the leaders to attend the summit in Rio de Janeiro on November 18 and 19.</p>

<p>India is part of the G20 troika along with Brazil and South Africa.</p>

<p>"This year, Brazil has built upon India's legacy. I look forward to meaningful discussions in keeping with our vision of 'One Earth, One Family, One Future'. I will also use the opportunity to exchange views on furthering bilateral cooperation with several other leaders," the prime minister said.</p>

<p>Induction of the 55-nation African Union as a permanent member of the G20 and managing to produce a leaders' declaration overcoming deep divisions over the Ukraine conflict were seen as major milestones of India's presidency of the G20 last year.</p>

<p>On his trip to Nigeria, Modi said it will be an opportunity to "build upon our strategic partnership that is based on shared belief in democracy and pluralism".</p>

<p>The prime minister is travelling to the country on a two-day visit from November 16-17 at the invitation of President Bola Ahmed Tinubu.</p>

<p>This will be my first visit to Nigeria, which is our close partner in the West African region, Modi said.</p>

<p>"I am also eagerly looking forward to meeting the Indian community and friends from Nigeria who have sent me warm welcome messages in Hindi," he said.</p>

<p>In the third and final leg of his trip, Modi will visit Guyana from November 19 to 21 at the invitation of President Mohamed Irfaan Ali.</p>

<p>It will be the first ever visit of an Indian prime minister to Guyana in over 50 years.</p>

<p>"We will exchange views on giving strategic direction to our unique relationship, which is based on shared heritage, culture and values," Modi said.</p>

<p>"I will also pay my respects to one of the oldest Indian diaspora, who migrated more than 185 years ago, and engage a fellow democracy, as I address their Parliament," he added.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[During Laura Helmuths tenure, the magazine made headlines for its rare endorsements, including a significant 2024 endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The editor-in-chief of Scientific American, the oldest continuously published magazine in the US, has resigned following backlash over comments she made about Donald Trump voters. Laura Helmuth, who led the renowned publication for over four years, stepped down after posting inflammatory remarks on social media that described Mr Trump's supporters as the "meanest, dumbest, most bigoted" group and labelled them "fascists."</p>

<p>In her resignation statement on <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://bsky.app/profile/laurahelmuth.bsky.social/post/3lawlkjh6ns23">Bluesky</a>, a platform rivalling X, Ms Helmuth said she had decided to leave after "an exciting 4.5 years as editor in chief," without addressing the controversy directly. Her now-deleted comments, made on election night, drew intense criticism, particularly from supporters, with many accusing her of compromising her role as a neutral journalist. Some demanded her resignation.</p>

<p>Ms Helmuth later apologised, calling her posts "offensive and inappropriate" and explaining that they were a "mistaken expression of shock and confusion about the election results." She clarified that the views expressed did not reflect her personal beliefs or the position of Scientific American, stressing that she "respects and values people across the political spectrum."</p>

<p>During Ms Helmuth's tenure, the magazine made headlines for its rare endorsements, including a significant 2024 endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris. Scientific American also has a long history of engaging with political matters, particularly when they intersect with science. Under Ms Helmuth's leadership, the magazine took a strong stance against Mr Trump's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, issuing its first-ever presidential endorsement in 2020 to support Joe Biden.</p>

<p>In her resignation announcement, Ms Helmuth shared that she planned to "take some time to think about what comes next" and "go bird-watching."</p>

<p>Kimberly Lau, president of Scientific American, confirmed in a statement that Ms Helmuth had "decided to move on from her position," as per the NYT, and expressed gratitude for her leadership during her tenure. "We thank Laura for her four years leading Scientific American, during which time the magazine won major science communications awards and saw the establishment of a reimagined digital newsroom," Ms Lau said as per <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/15/media/scientific-american-editor-resignation/index.html" rel="nofollow,noindex">CNN</a>.</p>

<p>A search for Laura Helmuth's replacement is currently underway.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Friday that Russia's war against his country will "end sooner" than it otherwise would have done once Donald Trump becomes US president next year.</p>

<p>"It is certain that the war will end sooner with the policies of the team that will now lead the White House. This is their approach, their promise to their citizens," Zelensky said in an interview with Ukrainian media outlet Suspilne.</p>

<p>"The war will end, but we don't know the exact date," he added.</p>

<p>Zelensky said he had a "constructive exchange" with Trump during their telephone conversation after his victory in the US presidential election.</p>

<p>"I didn't hear anything that goes against our position," he added.</p>

<p>Throughout the election campaign, Trump criticised the tens of billions of dollars in aid provided for Ukraine since the start of the Russian invasion in February 2022, and he promised he would resolve the conflict "in 24 hours", without ever explaining how.</p>

<p>Speaking at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida on Friday, Trump said "we're going to work very hard on Russia and Ukraine. It's got to stop."</p>

<p>Ukraine fears US support will flag just as its troops are struggling on the front, or that it will be forced to make territorial concessions to Russia.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Malcolm X, a civil rights leader, was assassinated on February 21, 1965, in Upper Manhattan.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">The daughters of civil rights leader&nbsp;Malcolm X have filed a $100 million lawsuit against the FBI, CIA, and New York Police Department (NYPD), accusing the agencies of playing a role in the assassination of their father in 1965.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The lawsuit, filed on Friday in Manhattan federal court, alleges that these agencies not only knew of the plot but also failed to intervene and prevent the killing, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/daughters-malcolm-x-sue-fbi-cia-nypd-100m-1965-assassination " rel="nofollow,noindex">Fox News</a> reported.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Malcolm X, born Malcolm Little, was assassinated on February 21, 1965, while speaking at the Audubon Ballroom in Upper Manhattan.</p>

<p dir="ltr">He was shot 21 times in front of his wife, Betty Shabazz, and their daughters, who were in the audience. While three men were initially convicted of the crime, two were exonerated in 2021 after new evidence surfaced, suggesting that key details had been overlooked or concealed by authorities.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Testimony from Mustafa Hassan, who was part of Malcolm X's security detail at the time, further complicated the case. Mr Hassan claimed that he tried to stop one of the shooters, Thomas Hagan (also known as Talmadge X Hayer), from fleeing the scene. However, police officers allegedly intervened to protect Hayer, with some officers reportedly asking each other, "Is he with us?"</p>

<p dir="ltr">Now, Ben Crump, the civil rights attorney representing the daughters and the Malcolm X estate, said that the lawsuit is an effort to expose the “corrupt, unlawful, and unconstitutional” actions taken by law enforcement and other government agencies leading up to Malcolm X's death. The complaint accuses the government of enabling a network of “ruthless killers,” who operated with impunity, concealing their actions for years.</p>

<p dir="ltr">"The government's fingerprints are all over the assassination of Malcolm X," Mr Crump claimed at a press conference. "We believe we have the evidence to prove it." He added that the Shabazz family has endured decades of uncertainty, without knowing who was truly responsible for the murder or the extent of the government's involvement. "The damage caused to the Shabazz family is unimaginable, immense, and irreparable," the lawsuit says.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Malcolm X's daughter, Ilyasah Shabazz, at a press conference held at the site of his death, spoke about her family's fight for justice. "We fought primarily for our mother, who was here," Ms Ilyasah said, as per <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/malcolm-xs-family-files-100-million-wrongful-death/story?id=115894702 " rel="nofollow,noindex">ABC News</a>. “My mother was pregnant when she came here to see her husband speak; someone who she just admired totally and to witness this horrific assassination of her husband.”</p>

<p dir="ltr">Malcolm X's rise to prominence was marked by his role as a spokesperson for the Nation of Islam, where he advocated for Black empowerment and civil rights “by any means necessary.” His eventual split from the organisation led to death threats from former allies, many of whom considered him a traitor.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The case also references the assassination of other Black leaders, such as Fred Hampton, the chairman of the Illinois chapter of the Black Panther Party, who was killed in 1969 by Chicago police officers. It draws a connection between these killings and COINTELPRO, a covert FBI program designed to disrupt and discredit Black political groups.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Indian Americans are working to reach out to the new Trump administration and the Congress next year to seek action against the Bangladeshi regime.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Indian Americans are working to reach out to the new Trump administration and the Congress next year to seek action against the Bangladeshi regime, including imposing economic sanctions, an influential community leader has said.</p>

<p>Encouraged by the recent statement of President-elect Donald Trump on Bangladesh, Dr Bharat Barai, an Indian American physician, exuded confidence that Trump would act against the South Asian nation over the persecution of the Hindu minority after he is sworn in as the 47th president of the United States.</p>

<p>He (Trump) has made a bold statement about the persecution of Bangladeshi Hindus and the desecration of Hindu temples," Barai told PTI in an interview. "He's a bold person who might consider economic sanctions if the situation doesn't improve," he added.</p>

<p>In Washington to attend the annual Diwali celebrations at the US Capitol, which was attended by over two dozen US lawmakers and Indian Americans from across the country, Barai said community members are actively working to engage the new administration and Congress to take action against the Bangladeshi regime, including potential economic sanctions.</p>

<p>"If their garment exports, which account for 80 percent of their business, are cut off, what will the people of Bangladesh eat?" he asked, alleging that Bangladesh's caretaker government, led by Muhammad Yunus, is merely a puppet controlled by the military. "It is really the army that is in control of the country," he added.</p>

<p>Barai expressed hope that such pressure would lead to a realisation in Bangladesh to stop the persecution of Hindus and other minorities. "We, as Hindu Americans, will also plead with the Congress to act if Bangladesh does not straighten out," he said.</p>

<p>He also urged the Indian government to take up the issue with Bangladesh and consider imposing sanctions if the persecution continues. "If they keep harassing Hindus and minorities, India should also impose sanctions on them," he said.</p>

<p>In a statement days before the November 5 general elections, Trump condemned the attack on Hindus in violence-hit Bangladesh.</p>

<p>"I strongly condemn the barbaric violence against Hindus, Christians, and other minorities who are getting attacked and looted by mobs in Bangladesh, which remains in a total state of chaos," Trump said.</p>

<p>"It would have never happened on my watch. Kamala and Joe have ignored Hindus across the world and in America. They have been a disaster from Israel to Ukraine to our own Southern Border, but we will Make America Strong Again and bring back Peace through Strength," then said.</p>

<p>"We will also protect Hindu Americans against the anti-religion agenda of the radical left. We will fight for your freedom. Under my administration," he said.</p>

<p>Barai said a lot of people are talking about external interference in the overthrow of a democratically elected government in Bangladesh. "Even among the Muslims now, there is a split. Some think that the Democrats engineered this coup in their countries, both Pakistan as well as Bangladesh," he said.</p>

<p>He pointed to figures such as George Soros and Peter Omidyar, suggesting they were part of a broader agenda to undermine Narendra Modi's leadership and promote Rahul Gandhi.</p>

<p>"If you remember that when President Trump visited India about three and a half years ago, riots were engineered, especially in Delhi, to coincide with his visit," he said.</p>

<p>He also expressed frustration with the influence of the "ultra-leftist woke lobby", saying he hoped they would either come to their senses or be sidelined or "put in their proper place".</p>

       <description><![CDATA[SpaceX intends to launch Starship on November 19 within a 30-minute window starting at 3.30 am IST.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">SpaceX's sixth test flight on November 19, while promising ground-breaking experiments, also features an unexpected addition. The first stage of the rocket at the launch pad in Boca Chica, Texas bears a sticker, featuring a banana holding a tiny banana.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">The sticker is a comical reference to the well-known "banana for scale" meme on the internet, which has been widely used to show the true-to-life size of another object by comparing it to a banana.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-media-max-width="560">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Starship moved to the pad at Starbase in advance of our sixth flight test <a href="https://t.co/u6Mbc35ARr">pic.twitter.com/u6Mbc35ARr</a></p>
— SpaceX (@SpaceX) <a href="https://twitter.com/SpaceX/status/1856424581948682324?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 12, 2024</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p dir="ltr">The meme is based on the notion that, in situations where measuring instruments are not available, a banana can serve as an approximate sense of scale because it is a widely recognised and reasonably standard-sized object.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">For instance, the rocket consists of the upper stage, known as Starship, and a huge first-stage booster called Super Heavy. With the two elements stacked, the rocket stands nearly 400 feet (122 m) tall. Considering its size, it is understandable why SpaceX chose to use the banana sticker to parody this scale challenge.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Even though the banana meme might get some attention, Starship's sixth test flight has more important goals in mind.</p>

<p dir="ltr">SpaceX intends to launch Starship on November 19 within a 30-minute window starting at 3.30 am IST.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">The mission will test a number of important elements, such as a novel method for using a tower to collect the Super Heavy booster and sophisticated heatshield studies intended to enhance the rocket's reentry capabilities.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">Furthermore, Starship will attempt several maneuvers during its atmospheric reentry over the Indian Ocean.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Iran has sent a message to the Joe Biden administration denying any plans to kill Donald Trump. This development comes after the Biden administration warned Iran in September that any attempt on Mr Trump's life would be considered “an act of war,” the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/15/world/middleeast/iran-trump-assassinate.html " rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">NY Times</a> reported.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The message, sent in October through an intermediary, was intended to ease tensions between Washington and Tehran. It followed a stern warning from the US, which had expressed grave concerns over potential Iranian retaliation for the killing of Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani in 2020, a move ordered by then-President Donald Trump.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Since Donald Trump's election victory on November 5, various Iranian officials, analysts, and media outlets have advocated for a more conciliatory approach with the president-elect, despite ongoing pressure from his allies to renew a hardline stance against Iran.</p>

<p dir="ltr">US officials have suggested that Iran may have sought revenge for Suleimani's death by targeting Mr Trump, citing <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/3rd-assassination-attempt-iran-man-charged-with-plotting-to-kill-trump-6977316 ">two indictments related to Iranian plots against the&nbsp;President-elect</a>. Further accusations have surfaced regarding other figures from the Trump administration.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">According to the US officials, the Iranian message focused on Tehran's position that the killing of General Suleimani was a criminal act. However, the communication also clarified that Iran had no intention of killing Trump. This message was confirmed by an Iranian official and analyst who engages with both sides. Iran, they said, expressed its desire to pursue justice for Suleimani's death through international legal channels rather than through violent means.</p>

<p dir="ltr">While the US officials noted that the message was not from any specific Iranian official, the Iranian official and analyst revealed that it was, in fact, from Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Iran's mission to the United Nations declined to comment but issued a statement reaffirming Tehran's commitment to addressing Suleimani's killing "through legal and judicial avenues."</p>

<p dir="ltr">Earlier, during the presidential campaign, American officials had warned of a potential Iranian plot to assassinate Donald Trump. Federal prosecutors in Manhattan recently confirmed that discussions among Iranian plotters had included plans to target the former president. However, Iran's Foreign Ministry rejected these claims as unfounded.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Elon Musk, a close ally of Mr Trump, met with Iran's ambassador to the United Nations on Monday at Mr Musk's request. The Iranians described the meeting with Ambassador Amir Saied Iravani, held in New York City at a secret location, as part of an effort to reduce tensions between the US and Iran under the Donald Trump administration.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">The US and Iran have not had official diplomatic relations since the 1979 revolution, during which 52 Americans were taken hostage at the US embassy in Tehran. The Swiss embassy in Tehran serves as the official diplomatic liaison between the two countries, though direct and indirect talks have taken place in recent years on various issues, including Iran's nuclear program and the swapping of detainees.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The messages exchanged between the US and Iran were sent through the Swiss, according to the Iranian official and analyst.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">A segment of the International Space Station (ISS), controlled by Russia, has been leaking for a few years now, allowing air and pressure to move out.</p>

<p dir="ltr">With the situation reaching a fever pitch, cosmonauts are scrambling to work on the problem areas, while officials from NASA and Roscosmos continue to disagree over the severity of the problem, <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/15/science/international-space-station-leak-nasa-russia/index.html">CNN </a>reported.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The space station having a size equal to a football field must remain pressurised and filled with breathable gases at all times so that the rotating crew of astronauts can continue to survive. It has separate but connected Russian and US sections.</p>

<p dir="ltr">In 2019, the problematic leaks were identified for the first time in a tunnel connecting Zvezda, a Russian module, to the docking port which welcomes spacecraft that carry cargo and supplies. However, this year the rate at which it is bleeding air has hit a new high.</p>

<p dir="ltr">As per the latest report by NASA's Office of Inspector General, oversight officials in the country consider this issue as the most pressing problem that the space station faces, threatening the crew's safety.</p>

<p dir="ltr">During a meeting on the issue on Wednesday, former NASA astronaut Bob Cabana, chair of the US space agency's ISS Advisory Committee, noted that it has "expressed concerns about the structural integrity of the (leaking module) and the possibility of a catastrophic failure”.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Although Roscosmos has asked cosmonauts to address the problematic areas, their team “does not believe catastrophic disintegration... is realistic,” Cabana noted.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Cabana stated that the Russians believe that continued operations are safe, however, they are unable to "prove that to our satisfaction".</p>

<p dir="ltr">"And the US believes that it's not safe, but we can't prove that to the Russian satisfaction," he added.</p>

<p dir="ltr">These disagreements persist even after a meeting that took place in Russia in September this year. The US, meanwhile, is pushing for independent experts from the two sides to evaluate this issue to help them reach a consensus on the root cause.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Cabana claimed that Russia is yet to comply with the recommendation, while the US already has taken steps to create its team of experts.</p>

<p dir="ltr">At the space station, both astronauts and cosmonauts have been asked to adopt precautionary measures like keeping the leaking segment sealed off at all times, except for times when it can open to unpacking cargo from spacecraft arriving at a nearby docking port. But they have to close the hatch that separates the US and Russian portions during this time, NASA astronaut Michael Barratt said on November 8.</p>

<p dir="ltr">In a statement, NASA informed that the cracks are “very small, not visible with the naked eye and have brackets and pipelines near them, making it difficult to get diagnostic tools into these areas”. The leak rate ranges between "2 to 2.5 pounds (of air) per day above space station baseline”.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Like physical hoarding, digital hoarding can also be detrimental to your mental health, experts say.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">While many people tend to keep excess stuff in their homes or storage areas, the new phenomenon of "digital hoarding" describes those who can't manage to thin out their online photo albums or clean their inboxes. Like physical hoarding, digital hoarding can also be detrimental to your mental health, experts say.</p>

<p dir="ltr">“It's something that triggers a lot of stress and anxiety, the collection of emails, pictures, open tabs — an overwhelming number of digital items that trigger overload,” said Dr Susan Albers, a clinical psychologist at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio to <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/15/health/digital-hoarding-clutter-wellness/index.html">CNN</a>.</p>

<p dir="ltr">She added, “What's interesting about it is that this isn't the type of problem that our ancestors have had to face, but when we fast-forward to today, our daily life is really plagued with a lot of digital clutter.”</p>

<p dir="ltr">It's possible that everyone who uses a digital gadget will eventually encounter this kind of clutter. However, occasionally, the typical practice can degenerate into a disorder—digital hoarding—that more academics are attempting to comprehend.</p>

<p dir="ltr">According to Dr. Emanuel Maidenberg, a clinical professor of psychiatry and biobehavioral sciences at UCLA's David Geffen School of Medicine, the urge to hoard may stem from one's wish to preserve memories with photographs or keep unnecessary records and files from previous employment or college courses as a precaution. All of this can be considered digital hoarding.</p>

<p dir="ltr">He said, “It becomes a habit that is motivated by anxiety, and that's when it becomes challenging and difficult. It has to do with the fear of needing this information at some point in the future and yet not having access to it and not knowing where to find it.”</p>

<p dir="ltr">According to a 2019 study that polled hundreds of adults in the UK, hoarding is a prevalent workplace practice and is thought to be linked to obsessive-compulsive disorder. There are four different sorts of digital hoarding, according to a 2020 follow-up study: organized people, disorganized people, people who hold digital information for their companies, and people who keep it away from people they care about and are frequently afraid of losing it.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Storing digital clutter that crosses over into a disorder depends on the individual, but a key factor is when it causes significant distress or impairment in everyday functioning, said Dr. Sanjaya Saxena, psychiatrist and director of clinical and research affairs at the Boston-based International OCD Foundation.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Dr. Susan Albers believes decluttering is the magic wand for your mental well-being. She suggests setting aside a short period of time every morning to perform a digital audit, eliminating unnecessary emails and other notifications. The remainder of your day will be far more productive if you take a few minutes to tidy up before you begin working.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Indian students are being put off applying to UK universities, adding to their financial woes at a time when education institutions are already coping with constrained budgets, a new report into the stability of the higher education sector in England has revealed.</p>

<p>Based on UK Home Office data on confirmation of acceptance for studies (CAS) by UK providers from 2022-23 to 2023-24, an Office for Students (OfS) analysis released on Friday shows a 20.4 per cent drop in Indian student numbers - down from 139,914 to 111,329.</p>

<p>Indian student groups in the UK said the fall was to be expected amid limited job prospects and also safety concerns following recent anti-immigration riots in some cities.</p>

<p>"There has been a considerable decline in student visa applications from prospective non-UK students in some major source countries," notes the report by OfS, a non-departmental public body of the government's Department for Education.</p>

<p>"This data shows an 11.8 per cent decline in the total number of sponsor acceptances issued to international students, as well as considerable variation for students with different nationalities, with the largest declines reported in the number of CAS issued to Indian and Nigerian students, down 28,585 (20.4 per cent) and 25,897 (44.6 per cent) respectively," it said.</p>

<p>It warns that universities with financial models that depend heavily on students from countries such as India, Nigeria and Bangladesh are likely to be significantly affected due to this downward trend.</p>

<p>"The number of international students from certain countries that send significant numbers to study in the UK has decreased significantly," OfS cautions.</p>

<p>"By 2025-26, based on current trends and not taking into account significant mitigating action, we estimate a net income reduction for the sector of GBP 3,445 million, and, without significant mitigating actions, a sector-level deficit of minus GBP 1,636 million, with up to 72 per cent of providers being in deficit, and 40 per cent having low liquidity," it adds.</p>

<p>The Indian National Students' Association (INSA) UK said it was not surprised with the significant decrease in students from India given the government's clampdown on foreign students being allowed to bring along their dependent partners and spouses.</p>

<p>"Students are not allowed to bring their partners to the UK under the new policy and given the economic conditions here and recent rioting stories, unless the government addresses this issue the outlook for UK universities is bleak as they rely heavily on Indian students," said INSA UK President Amit Tiwari.</p>

<p>Indians overtook the Chinese in recent years as the leading nationality granted study visas to the UK and are the largest cohort to access the Graduate Route post-study work visa, which was thrown into disarray due to a review which has since concluded it is here to stay.</p>

<p>"Many reasons contribute to the decline in numbers, including the Conservative ban on dependents, confusion around post-study work visa, increase in skilled worker salary thresholds and an apparent lack of jobs in the UK," said Sanam Arora, chair of the National Indian Students and Alumni Union (NISAU) UK.</p>

<p>"We discovered the scale of misinformation that continues to persist; for the first time, safety is also being raised as a concern... Universities need to ensure that they are communicating the UK offer adequately and at scale in India to address the confusions that persist," she said.</p>

<p>"Universities also need to invest significantly in their employability support in order to stay competitive and provide a wholesome, outcome-oriented offer for students," she added.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

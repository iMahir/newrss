       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>SpaceX successfully "caught" the first-stage booster of its Starship megarocket Sunday as it returned to the launch pad after a test flight, a world first in the company's quest for rapid reusability.</p>

<p>The "super heavy booster" had blasted off attached to the Starship rocket minutes earlier, then made a picture-perfect controlled return to the same pad in Texas, where a pair of huge mechanical "chopsticks" reached out from the launch tower to bring the slowly descending booster to a halt, according to a livestream from Elon Musk's SpaceX company.</p>

<p>"Folks, this is a day for the engineering history books," a SpaceX spokesperson said in a voiceover on the company's livestream, after the booster was safely in the tower's grasp and company staffers had erupted in cheers.</p>

<p>"The tower has caught the rocket!!" SpaceX founder Musk posted on X.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Booster starts in top right corner. Watch to the end. Sound on <a href="https://t.co/jS70tHLNcr">pic.twitter.com/jS70tHLNcr</a></p>
— ?????? ???? ? (@kimbal) <a href="https://twitter.com/kimbal/status/1845451222750306344?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 13, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p>Liftoff occurred at 7:25 am (1225 GMT) in clear weather. While the booster returned to the launchpad, the upper stage of Starship was due to splash down in the Indian Ocean within the hour.</p>

<p>During its last flight in June, SpaceX achieved its first successful splashdown with Starship, a prototype spaceship that Musk hopes will one day carry humans to Mars.</p>

<p>NASA is also keenly awaiting a modified version of Starship to act as a lander vehicle for crewed flights to the Moon under the Artemis program later this decade.</p>

<p>SpaceX said its engineers have "spent years preparing and months testing for the booster catch attempt, with technicians pouring tens of thousands of hours into building the infrastructure to maximize our chances for success."</p>

<p>Teams were monitoring to ensure "thousands" of criteria were met both on the vehicle and at the tower before any attempt to return the Super Heavy booster.</p>

<p>Had the conditions not been satisfied, the booster would have been redirected for a splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico, as in previous tests.</p>

<p>Instead, having been given the green light, the returning booster decelerated from supersonic speeds and the powerful "chopstick arms" embraced it.</p>

<p>'Fail fast, learn fast'</p>

<p>The large mechanical arms, called "Mechazilla" by Musk, have generated considerable excitement among space enthusiasts.</p>

<p>Starship stands 397 feet (121 meters) tall with both stages combined -- about 90 feet taller than the Statue of Liberty.</p>

<p>Its Super Heavy booster, which is 233 feet tall, produces 16.7 million pounds (74.3 Meganewtons) of thrust, about twice as powerful as the Saturn V rockets used during the Apollo missions.</p>

<p>SpaceX's "fail fast, learn fast" strategy of rapid iterative testing, even when its rockets blow up spectacularly, has ultimately accelerated development and contributed to the company's success.</p>

<p>Founded only in 2002, it quickly leapfrogged aerospace industry giants and is now the world leader in orbital launches, besides providing the only US spaceship currently certified to carry astronauts.</p>

<p>It has also created the world's biggest internet satellite constellation -- invaluable in disaster and war zones.</p>

<p>But its founding vision of making humanity a multiplanetary species is increasingly at risk of being overshadowed by Musk's embrace of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and his alignment with right-wing politics.</p>

<p>In recent weeks, the company has openly sparred with the Federal Aviation Administration over launch licensing and alleged violations, with Musk accusing the agency of overreach and calling for its chief, Michael Whitaker, to resign.</p>

<p>"He's trying to position himself for minimal regulatory interference with SpaceX once Donald Trump becomes president," said Mark Hass, a marketing expert and professor at Arizona State University. "But it's a calculated gamble if things go the other way."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[When Pisciotta told West she had no memory of that studio session, West allegedly laughed.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kanye West's former assistant has filed a lawsuit, accusing him of drugging and sexually assaulting her during a studio session he co-hosted with Sean "Diddy" Combs. Lauren Pisciotta, who was employed by West from 2021 to 2022, claims in an amended complaint obtained by <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://people.com/lawsuit-accuses-kanye-west-of-drugging-and-sexually-assaulting-ex-assistant-8727602" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>PEOPLE </em></a>that West committed "sexual battery" after giving her a drink that was laced with a substance.</p>

<p>Pisciotta's allegations are an extension of her earlier wrongful termination lawsuit against West, in which she alleged she was subjected to explicit messages, pornographic images, videos, and phone calls from him before she was fired. She began working with West in July 2021 to assist with his Yeezy women's fashion line and collaborate on his 2021 album, Donda.</p>

<p>Previously, a legal representative for West denied Pisciotta's other claims and stated that "Ye will be filing a lawsuit against Ms. Pisciotta."</p>

<p>According to the now-amended complaint filed on Oct. 8 in Los Angeles County Court, Pisciotta alleges that before her employment with West, he invited her to a studio session in Santa Monica, Calif., where "drinks were served to others in attendance, followed by an announcement that everyone had to drink if they wanted to stay."</p>

<p>The lawsuit claims that West and Combs co-hosted the studio session, and Pisciotta attended with a "former artist management client." Although Combs is named in the amended complaint as a co-host, Pisciotta is not accusing him of any wrongdoing.</p>

<p>The filing further alleges that the drink served to Pisciotta-allegedly by a studio assistant at West's request- was "laced with an unidentifiable drug," causing her to feel disoriented after just "a few small sips."</p>

<p>"As plaintiff began to slip into an altered and heavily impaired state, she felt less in control of her body and speech, and that is where plaintiff's memories of that night escape her," the complaint reads.</p>

<p>According to the filing, Pisciotta woke up the next day "feeling physically ill and confused" and experienced "immense shame and embarrassment" for not being able to recall what happened after drinking at the studio session.</p>

<p>For years, West's former assistant believed she had been drugged and humiliated herself at a work event. Later on, after West hired Pisciotta as an assistant, Chief of Staff, and A&amp;R representative, he allegedly brought up that night for the first time. During the conversation, West told Pisciotta that they had "kind of hooked up a little one time," referring to the night at the Santa Monica studio where the alleged assault occurred.</p>

<p>When Pisciotta told West she had no memory of that studio session, West allegedly laughed and remarked, "Women love to say they don't remember," according to the complaint.</p>

<p>"Up until that very moment, right before that very conversation, Plaintiff was unaware that she had been subjected to gender violence and sexual battery on that studio night by KANYE WEST a.k.a YE," the document states.</p>

<p>The amended complaint also states that Pisciotta felt "overcome with immense shame, discomfort, and utter disgust."</p>

<p>Additionally, Pisciotta alleges that in July 2021, during an "album workshop" at the St. Regis Hotel in San Francisco, West "aggressively pounded" on her hotel room door at 6 a.m., forced his way into her room, and claimed he needed to use her shower because his was out of order. She further alleges that West later approached her, "dropped his towel," and attempted to "forcefully thrust his naked body onto and penis into Plaintiff's face," ignoring her pleas to stop. According to the complaint, West then "swiftly left" after saying "sorry" and continued his day as if nothing had happened.</p>

<p>The complaint also claims that Pisciotta, who alleges she received lewd messages from West and was fired from her Chief of Staff position at his companies just a month after her promotion in September 2022, "could not stomach the fact that she worked for the man who had sexually assaulted her while she was drugged, who then successfully lured her back into his orbit through a job opportunity to repeat the assault."</p>

<p>West is also facing a separate lawsuit filed in April 2024 by a former employee who claimed to have suffered "severe discrimination [and] harassment" while working for Yeezy and at his Donda Academy school. Additionally, a former staffer recently filed a lawsuit alleging emotional distress, retaliation, and labour code violations.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iran's top diplomat vowed Sunday there would be "no red lines" for the country in defending its people and interests, ahead of Israel's expected retaliation for Iran's recent missile attack.</p>

<p>"While we have made tremendous efforts in recent days to contain an all-out war in our region, I say it clearly that we have no red lines in defending our people and interests," Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi wrote in a post on X.</p>

<p>Iran fired 200 missiles at Israel on October 1 in what it said was retaliation for the killing of Tehran-aligned operator leaders in the region and a general in Iran's Revolutionary Guards.</p>

<p>Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant has vowed Israel's response will be "deadly, precise, and surprising".</p>

<p>Araghchi was in Baghdad to discuss the wars in Gaza and Lebanon with Iraqi officials, according to the ministry.</p>

<p>Ali al-Moussawi, political advisor to the Iraqi prime minister, told AFP Araghchi's visit was part of a diplomatic effort "to silence weapons and violence... to establish security and stability in the region".</p>

<p>After Baghdad, Araghchi will head to Oman, the Iranian ISNA news agency reported.</p>

<p>On Thursday, Araghchi was in Qatar where he met Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani over the wars in Gaza and Lebanon.</p>

<p>Qatar has been mediating talks aimed at a Gaza ceasefire and has called for a truce in Lebanon.</p>

<p>A day earlier, Araghchi met Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and his Saudi counterpart Prince Faisal bin Farhan.</p>

<p>In a recent interview, Araghchi said Iran does "not want war" but it was "not afraid of it."</p>

<p>"We will be ready for any scenario," he told Al Jazeera news network.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a bid to connect with male voters ahead of the upcoming US elections, Democratic Vice Presidential candidate and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz participated in the annual Minnesota Governor's Pheasant Hunting Opener on Saturday. However, his trip took an unexpected turn when he struggled to load his shotgun, a Beretta A400.</p>

<p>Dressed in hunting attire, including chaps and an orange vest, Walz was seen struggling while attempting to load shells into the semi-automatic shotgun. “It never fits quite right,” he said in a video that quickly made the rounds online. Despite his best efforts, the governor was unable to fire the gun or bag any pheasants during the hunt.</p>

<p>Tim Walz, who once held a top rating from the National Rifle Association during his 12 years in Congress, has since shifted towards supporting stricter gun control measures.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Initially, Walz held more conservative stances, earning “A” ratings from the National Rifle Association (NRA) while representing a rural Minnesota district from 2007 to 2019. However, after mass shootings like the 2017 Las Vegas tragedy, Walz distanced himself from the NRA, donating his NRA contributions to veterans' charities and advocating for stronger gun control measures.</p>

<p>As Minnesota's governor, he has supported universal background checks, red-flag laws, and an assault weapons ban, prioritising public safety over gun lobby positions. This has earned him criticism from the NRA, which labelled him a “political chameleon” for altering his stance as his political ambitions grew. However, groups like Everytown for Gun Safety praise Walz for balancing responsible gun ownership with common-sense safety laws.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chinese premier Li Qiang could inaugurate operations at a Chinese-funded airport in Pakistan's Balochistan province during his visit to the country in the coming week, information minister Attaullah Tarar told reporters on Sunday.</p>

<p>The start of operations at the $200-million Gwadar International Airport has been pushed back for a security review after deadly attacks by separatist militants in August in the area, government and aviation sources said.</p>

<p>Li, along with ministers and government officials will visit Pakistan from Oct. 14 to 17, Pakistan's foreign affairs ministry said on Sunday.</p>

<p>Pakistan is hosting the meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), which comprises nine full members, including China, India, Iran and Russia, and is scheduled for Oct. 15 and 16 in Islamabad.</p>

<p>The new airport will handle domestic and international flights, according to Pakistan's Civil Aviation Authority, and will be one of the country's biggest airports.</p>

<p>The initial plan was for Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to inaugurate the airport on Aug. 14 alongside Chinese officials, but that was called off after an ethnic Baloch rights group started a sit-in protest, the officials said.</p>

<p>A decades-long insurgency in Balochistan by separatist militant groups has led to frequent attacks against the government, army and Chinese interests in the region to press demands for a share in mineral-rich regional resources.</p>

<p>Two Chinese nationals were killed in an explosion near the international airport of the southern Pakistani city of Karachi last week, the Chinese embassy in Pakistan said.</p>

<p>Separatist militant group the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) claimed responsibility for the attack, which it said had targeted Chinese nationals, including engineers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>China said on Thursday it would work with Pakistan to protect the safety and security of Chinese personnel, projects and institutions in Pakistan.</p>

<p>Besides the separatists, the region is also home to Islamist militants, who have been active again since 2022 after revoking a ceasefire with the government.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Israeli military said on Sunday its troops in Lebanon had captured a Hezbollah operator, the first such announcement since it launched a cross-border ground offensive.</p>

<p>"During limited, localised and targeted raids based on precise intelligence... soldiers discovered an underground tunnel shaft," the army said in a statement.</p>

<p>"The troops encircled the building, scanned the tunnel shaft, and discovered an underground compound... where a Hezbollah terrorist was embedded alongside weapons and equipment."</p>

<p>The military did not specify when he was captured, while Hezbollah did not offer an immediate comment.</p>

<p>The army said that the fighter surrendered to its soldiers, who "interrogated him on-site and then transferred him to a detention facility for further questioning within Israel".</p>

<p>In a video clip released with the statement, a group of Israeli soldiers can be seen speaking in Arabic with the Hezbollah fighter as he slowly emerges from the tunnel.</p>

<p>"Come out before your life is over," the Israeli soldiers are heard calling to the Hezbollah fighter.</p>

<p>The fighter then asks the soldiers if they want a cigarette, to which one of the soldiers replies: "Cigarettes, coffee and $5,000."</p>

<p>The Israeli army launched a ground operation in southern Lebanon on September 30, carrying out "targeted raids" in the villages along the border.</p>

<p>The army says it has detected multiple tunnel shafts under homes, including one it said was about 25 meters long and crossed into Israel.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A German neo-Nazi fell to his death while climbing what is known as Adolf Hitler's “favourite mountain” on September 29. Andreas Munzhuber, a senior member of the Bavarian faction of the neo-Nazi group The Third Way, was part of a climbing group of 30 when he slipped on a wet root and plummeted 196 feet down rocky terrain, according to reports from German news outlets.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Andreas Munzhuber's friends, along with two other climbers on the 1,972-metre mountain, quickly called emergency services after the fall. However, he was pronounced dead at the scene. An emergency rescue helicopter was dispatched, and a medical doctor was lowered to the site, but Munzhuber was already dead, according to the German publication Merkur.</p>

<p>Hitler had a fondness for Untersberg mountain, having chosen the area to build his Eagle's Nest retreat nearby, reported the Telegraph. This mountain has become a site of pilgrimage for fascist groups over the years. In 2017, a group was spotted performing Nazi salutes and shouting “Sieg Heil” at passersby. The following morning, the owners of the guest house where the group had stayed discovered beer mats decorated with swastikas.</p>

<p>Andreas Munzhuber was the treasurer and assessor of the regional association of the small right-wing extremist party known as The Third Way. He is said to have left behind a partner and a baby born in June.</p>

<p>The Prisoner Aid Friends Circle, a group that supports imprisoned neo-Nazis, along with other right-wing groups, said, “His death hits us all hard. I ask you to support a little girl who will never know her father,” as per the <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/10/11/world-news/german-neo-nazi-plummets-to-his-death-hiking-hitlers-favorite-mountain/">NY Post</a>.</p>

<p>Right-wing extremist groups are now raising donations to support Munzhuber's wife and child, and to erect a memorial stone at the site of his death, according to German news reports. A tribute on a fundraising page seeking donations for his funeral said, "Munzi, as everyone called him, was only 37 years old and still had many plans in life. His death hits us all hard." It continued," But the biggest gap has emerged at the dinner table at home. His wife now has to raise their daughter alone."</p>

<p>"She is not yet four months old and was the sunshine of Munzi's life. She is the spitting image of Munzi. He will live on in her and in our hearts." As of Friday afternoon, around £10,000 (around Rs 11 lakh) had been donated to the page.</p>

<p>Andreas Munzhuber was described as a "senior board member" of the neo-Nazi group Der III Weg (The Third Way), according to German news outlet T-Online. The Third Way (Der Dritte Weg) was founded in the southwestern city of Heidelberg in September 2013 as an offshoot of the far-right National Democratic Party (NPD).</p>

       <description><![CDATA[The lawsuit claims that Brett Kimmel groped the student, pressured her to perform oral sex and attempted to have sex with her just before her 18th birthday.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A former Manhattan public school principal is facing a federal lawsuit alleging that he sexually abused a student "nearly every day," referring to her as "baby" and "princess." The lawsuit claims that Brett Kimmel who now lives in Maryland groped the student, pressured her to perform oral sex and attempted to have sex with her just before her 18th birthday, the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/10/12/us-news/nyc-principal-sexually-abused-student-nearly-every-day-lawsuit/" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>New York Post</em></a> reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The court papers further claimed that the accused allegedly "set his sights" on the girl when she was in eighth grade at the Washington Heights Expeditionary Learning School more than a decade ago.</p>

<p>Kimmel sent the victim multiple inappropriate texts and emails every day during her freshman year, and later asked her to send him shirtless selfies, she claimed in her April Manhattan federal court lawsuit against Kimmel and the city Department of Education. The court papers further contended that the messages didn't stop even after the teen's older sister confronted Kimmel about his deranged notes in the summer of 2012.&nbsp;</p>

<p>She claimed that the principal used to drive her to and from school, molesting her during the car rides during her sophomore and junior years.</p>

<p>The woman claimed that her prolonged abuse was due to the Department of Education's (DOE) "negligent supervision," including a lack of staff and faculty training to report suspicious behaviour and ignoring students' comments about the abuse.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to city payroll records, the Special Commissioner of Investigation for city schools had no reports on file for Kimmel, who earned $182,844 in the fiscal year 2015 and left the DOE in the fall of that year.</p>

<p>Years after the abuse ended, the woman decided to file a lawsuit "to hold the wrongdoer accountable so he doesn't get to do this again to someone else," her attorney, Julia Kuan, told The Post.</p>

<p>Kuan noted that the woman did not report the abuse to the police at the time but declined to elaborate due to client confidentiality.</p>

<p>Court documents indicate that she is seeking unspecified damages.</p>

<p>Kimmel, now working as an education consultant in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., denied the sexual abuse allegations through his lawyer, Alan Sash, and requested that the case be dismissed in court filings.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Taiwan said it was "on alert" as it detected a Chinese aircraft carrier group to its south on Sunday, days after the United States warned Beijing against taking "provocative" actions on the self-ruled island.</p>

<p>US State Secretary Antony Blinken warned China on Friday against taking action in response to a speech by Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te during the island's National Day celebrations.</p>

<p>China has ramped up military activity around Taiwan in recent years, sending in warplanes and other military aircraft while Chinese ships maintain a near-constant presence around its waters.</p>

<p>Taiwan's defence ministry said Sunday that a Chinese Liaoning aircraft carrier group had entered the Bashi Channel, a waterway that separates the island from the Philippines, "and is likely to proceed into the western Pacific".</p>

<p>"The Taiwanese military is employing joint intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance systems to closely monitor related activities and remains on alert, prepared to respond as necessary," it said in a statement.</p>

<p>China's military meanwhile released a video on Sunday saying it was "prepared for battle", with a small map of Taiwan included in its title.</p>

<p>The video, posted on the People's Liberation Army Eastern Theater Command's social media channels, shows missiles, jets, helicopters, and warships. China's military was "ready for battle at any time" the post added.</p>

<p>Taiwan and US officials had warned of possible Chinese military drills in response to Lai's speech.</p>

<p>The United States is Taiwan's most important backer and biggest supplier of weapons, but does not hold formal diplomatic relations with Taipei.</p>

<p><strong>'Resist annexation'</strong></p>

<p>Lai, who took office in May, has been more outspoken than his predecessor Tsai Ing-wen in defending Taiwan's sovereignty, angering Beijing, which calls him a "separatist".</p>

<p>In his speech on Thursday, Lai vowed to "resist annexation" of the island, and insisted Beijing and Taipei were "not subordinate to each other".</p>

<p>China warned after the speech that Lai's "provocations" would result in "disaster" for the people of Taiwan.</p>

<p>Taiwan's National Day on Thursday marked the 113th anniversary of the toppling of China's Qing dynasty and the subsequent founding of the Republic of China -- which remains Taiwan's official name.</p>

<p>The current dispute between China and Taiwan dates back to a civil war in which the nationalist forces of Chiang Kai-shek were defeated by Mao Zedong's communist fighters and fled to Taiwan in 1949.</p>

<p>Lai's Democratic Progressive Party has long defended the sovereignty and democracy of Taiwan, which has its own government, military and currency.</p>

<p>Beijing has sought to erase Taipei from the international stage, blocking it from global forums and poaching its diplomatic allies.</p>

<p>China has held three rounds of large-scale war games in the past two years, deploying aircraft and ships to encircle the island.</p>

<p>Taiwan's defence ministry said Sunday that 11 Chinese military aircraft and eight navy vessels were detected around the island in the 24 hours to 6:00 am.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 32-year-old mother from Minnesota, US, has become the face of a rare and painful condition often referred to as "vampire disease." Phoenix Nightingale has a severe allergy to sulphur – a compound found in garlic – which can lead to potentially fatal reactions if ingested. "People call it the vampire disease," she explained in an interview with Jam Press.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This unusual disorder, known as acute intermittent porphyria, can cause severe pain, migraines, constipation and vomiting for days when triggered. This condition shares a historical connection with the legendary Count Dracula, as it is suspected that Vlad III, the inspiration for Dracula, also suffered from porphyria.</p>

<p>The condition has led to myths about vampires' aversion to garlic, sunlight and their pale appearance. Ms Nightingale said, “It comes from the legend about them needing to avoid garlic, having to stay out of the sun, looking pale and having receding teeth.” She adds that the neurological side effects of the disorder can lead people to mistakenly view those affected as “monsters or possessed," as per the <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/10/11/lifestyle/i-have-the-same-rare-vampire-condition-as-dracula-garlic-can-kill-me/">NY Post</a>.</p>

<p>Due to her condition, Ms Nightingale is forced to strictly avoid foods containing sulphur. “Eating high amounts or over an extended period could be fatal,” she said. Symptoms can appear suddenly or develop over weeks, making it challenging to navigate her daily life. “I'm very careful about what I put in my body. I avoid a lot of food. I stick to what I know is safe. I can't even take most medications,” she shared.</p>

<p>Since her diagnosis, she has not eaten garlic, saying, “I could never eat garlic bread. It could send me into an attack.” The debilitating attacks can last for days, during which she may vomit up to 60 times, and can also lead to breathing difficulties.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“I've experienced over 480 attacks in my life, searching for answers, desperate for a diagnosis that only came last year,” she said, adding that the pain is worse than childbirth.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“I had one attack where I didn't go to the hospital, and it went on for 40 hours. It was non-stop vomiting, losing consciousness, screaming, and crying.”</p>

<p>Dining out is an additional challenge for Ms Nightingale, as garlic is a common ingredient in many dishes. She avoids other sulphur-rich foods, including red grapes, soy, alcohol and coffee. “When I go out for dinner, unless it's a place I know, I look at a menu and I cry because I don't know what I can eat,” she confessed.</p>

<p>Ms Nightingale has chosen to share her story publicly to raise awareness about her condition and to support others who may be struggling with similar undiagnosed symptoms. “It took 31 years to get diagnosed, and I had to pay out of pocket and spend years running analytics on it,” she explained. “It's hard as a diagnosed person not being able to find a doctor who can help. When I see a doctor or go to the hospital, they have to Google the condition.”</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the 2024 US presidential race heats up, billionaires across the country are quietly taking sides, providing significant financial backing to either Vice President Kamala Harris or former President Donald Trump. While some, like Elon Musk, are vocal about their support, others, such as Warren Buffett and Mark Zuckerberg, are opting to stay on the sidelines, despite rumours and speculation about their political leanings.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2024/10/12/kamala-harris-has-more-billionaires-openly-backing-her-than-trump-but-many-are-staying-silent/">Forbes</a>, 76 billionaires are backing Kamala Harris, while 49 billionaires have been identified as supporters of Donald Trump.</p>

<p>Many more billionaires may still commit to a candidate, but their contributions won't be made public until after the election when the final Federal Election Commission reports are released in December.</p>

<h3><strong>Why are billionaires leaning toward Harris?</strong></h3>

<p>Despite Kamala Harris's criticism of pro-billionaire policies, many ultra-wealthy individuals support her due to pragmatic reasons. A letter from more than a dozen billionaires endorsing Harris emphasised that she is expected to maintain “fair and predictable policies” that ensure economic stability. This resonates particularly well with Silicon Valley billionaires who have known Harris since her days as a California prosecutor. A recent survey also revealed that sectors like technology, healthcare and sustainability would thrive under a Harris presidency.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Kamala Harris backers</strong></h3>

<p>Among the 76 billionaires supporting Harris, 28 have donated $1 million or more to groups backing her. Here are some notable names:</p>

<ul>
	<li aria-level="1">Michael Bloomberg (Former New York mayor, Bloomberg)</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Arthur Blank (Atlanta Falcons)</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Reid Hoffman (LinkedIn)</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Vinod Khosla (Khosla Ventures)</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Dustin Moskovitz (Facebook)</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Steven Spielberg (Hollywood director)</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, 36 billionaires contributed between $50,000 and $999,999. Some of these include:</p>

<ul>
	<li aria-level="1">Tory Burch (Fashion designer)</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Reed Hastings (Netflix)</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Chris Larsen (Ripple)</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Laurene Powell Jobs (Apple)</li>
</ul>

<p>Further, Melinda French Gates, Joe Gebbia (Airbnb), and several other prominent figures have financially backed the Democratic Presidential candidate. High-profile individuals such as Mark Cuban and Magic Johnson signed an open letter endorsing her.</p>

<h3><strong>Donald Trump's billionaire supporters</strong></h3>

<p>Trump, who has positioned himself as a champion of the ultra-wealthy and working-class alike, has garnered significant backing from 49 billionaires. Notable supporters include:</p>

<ul>
	<li aria-level="1">Miriam Adelson (Las Vegas Sands Corp.)</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Don Ahern (Las Vegas construction)</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Diane Hendricks (ABC Supply)</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Linda McMahon (WWE)</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Steve Wynn (Wynn Resorts)</li>
</ul>

<p>Another 16 billionaires have contributed between $50,000 and $999,999, including:</p>

<ul>
	<li aria-level="1">Tilman Fertitta (Houston Rockets)</li>
	<li aria-level="1">John Paulson (Paulson &amp; Co.)</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Thomas Siebel (Siebel Systems)</li>
</ul>

<p>Trump's supporters also include tech magnate Elon Musk, who has actively stumped for him, appearing at a rally and offering incentives to swing state voters through his political action committee.</p>

<h3><strong>Billionaires staying neutral (For now)</strong></h3>

<p>While many billionaires are openly supporting either Harris or Trump, others are keeping their distance for the time being:</p>

<ul>
	<li aria-level="1">Jeff Bezos, the Amazon founder, has praised Donald Trump's resilience after he was shot but has yet to publicly endorse a candidate.</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Warren Buffett is a known Democrat but has stayed quiet this cycle.</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Mark Zuckerberg reportedly had private discussions with Donald Trump but has not endorsed any candidate.</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Bill Gates has not officially endorsed a candidate. However, in a July interview, he expressed positive sentiments toward Harris, noting, “It's great to have somebody who's younger, who can think about things like AI and how we shape that in the right way.”&nbsp;</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JPMorgan Chase, the largest US bank, has not endorsed any candidate, according to his spokesperson. However, last week, Trump shared a false social media post claiming Dimon's endorsement.&nbsp;</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Ray Dalio, the founder of Bridgewater Associates, the world's largest hedge fund, described the upcoming election as “the most consequential” of his life. Yet, he has not endorsed either Harris or Trump.</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Sergey Brin, Google co-founder, who previously found Trump's election “deeply offensive” as an immigrant, has kept his feelings private during this election cycle, with no public statements regarding the current candidates.</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Larry Ellison and Ken Griffin: These two billionaires have remained surprisingly silent in the final months leading up to the election, despite their past financial support for Republican causes.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>As the election approaches, more billionaires may reveal their preferences.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On October 7, 2023, Hamas, the Palestinian militant group, launched a devastating and unprecedented attack on Israel. The scale and brutality of the assault left more than 1,200 people dead, and hundreds taken hostage, plunging the region into renewed violence and sparking an all-out war.</p>

<p>While the attack appeared sudden and shocking to the international community, recently unearthed documents suggest that it had been years in the making and could have been executed even earlier, potentially launching strikes akin to the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Centre in the United States.</p>

<p>According to a series of <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/12/world/middleeast/hamas-israel-war.html" rel="nofollow,noindex">reports</a> by international media outlets, including The New York Times, The Washington Post, and The Wall Street Journal, Hamas had originally planned the October 7 assault for the previous year. The group delayed the attack to coordinate with Iran and Hezbollah, seeking to strengthen their military capabilities and secure additional funding. These findings, drawn from documents and correspondences between Hamas leaders and Iranian officials, reveal meticulous planning, with ambitions that stretched far beyond the deadly events of October 7.</p>

<h2><strong>'The Big Project'</strong></h2>

<p>According to the findings, as early as January 2022, Hamas leaders had been discussing a large-scale operation, referred to in internal communications as "the big project." As per the minutes from 10 high-level meetings held by Hamas's military and political leadership over the course of two years, the group had been preparing for an assault designed to cripple Israel's military infrastructure and target its civilian population.</p>

<p><strong>READ | </strong><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/israel-hezbollah-lebanon-1982-to-2024-a-42-year-history-of-bloodshed-between-israel-hezbollah-6636042">1982 to 2024: A 42-Year History Of Bloodshed Between Israel, Hezbollah</a></p>

<p>Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, who played a central role in these discussions, was joined by top commanders Muhammed Deif, Marwan Issa, and his brother, Muhammad Sinwar. The meetings began in January 2022 and continued until August 2023, with participants discussing logistical strategies and potential targets. During one early meeting in 2022, attendees decided to avoid prematurely escalating tensions with Israel, instead focusing on the "big project," which would involve unprecedented coordination and resources.</p>

<p>But Hamas's ambitions stretched beyond Gaza. The group actively sought the financial and military support of regional powers, particularly Iran. As early as June 2021, Sinwar had written to Iranian officials, seeking financial assistance to fund what would eventually become the October 7 attack. "We promise you that we will not waste a minute or a penny unless it takes us toward achieving this sacred goal," Sinwar reportedly wrote.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This request yielded an initial $10 million in funding, and later, Hamas asked for a staggering $500 million to be distributed over two years.</p>

<h2><strong>Change In Strategy</strong></h2>

<p>Though the attack was initially scheduled for late 2022, Hamas postponed it for over a year. According to documents obtained by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/10/12/exclusive-hamas-documents-sinwar-planning-iran/" rel="nofollow,noindex">shared</a> with The Washington Post, this delay was largely due to ongoing efforts to enlist more substantial help from Iran and Hezbollah.</p>

<p>In August 2023, Hamas's deputy, Khalil al-Hayya, allegedly travelled to Lebanon to meet with a senior commander in Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), Mohammed Said Izadi, to discuss the operational details of the assault. Izadi expressed Iran and Hezbollah's tentative support but said that they needed more time to "prepare the environment" for a broader regional escalation.</p>

<p><strong>Explained </strong>| <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/israel-palestine-conflict-hamas-gaza-explained-israel-palestine-and-a-history-of-conflict-4458888">Israel-Palestine And A History Of Conflict</a></p>

<p>Though Hamas had hoped for more direct involvement from these regional actors, the group ultimately launched the attack without their immediate assistance. The precise reasons for this decision remain unclear, but the timing suggests several geopolitical factors. For instance, by mid-2023, Israel had been on the verge of deploying a new, advanced air defence system, which Hamas feared could thwart their assault if they delayed any further, the New York Times reported.</p>

<p>Additionally, the warming relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia - a potential breakthrough in regional diplomacy - likely pushed Hamas to act before these ties could solidify.</p>

<p>The internal turmoil within Israel also played a role. By 2023, Israel had been grappling with mass protests and political unrest sparked by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's controversial judicial overhaul. Hamas leaders saw Israel's "internal situation" as a key vulnerability, reasoning that the state was distracted by its own domestic crises and, therefore, more susceptible to a major attack.</p>

<h2><strong>Plot For A 9/11-Style Attack</strong></h2>

<p>One of the most chilling revelations from these documents is Hamas's original plan to carry out a 9/11-style bombing in Israel, targeting the iconic Azrieli Towers in Tel Aviv, the Washington Post reported. These skyscrapers house offices, a shopping mall, and a central train station. The plan envisioned a devastating strike reminiscent of the September 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center in New York, with the aim of toppling the towers and causing mass casualties.</p>

<p>However, after months of discussions, Hamas concluded that it lacked the capability to execute such an ambitious plan. The group scrapped the 9/11-style bombing, along with other audacious proposals, such as using horse-drawn carriages as a "fast and light mechanism" to transport fighters across Israeli defences without arousing suspicion.</p>

<p>By September 2022, Hamas leaders believed they were ready to launch their attack, beginning with strikes on Israeli military bases before expanding to civilian areas. However, the assault was again postponed. Sinwar and his top commanders continued to refine the plan, holding covert meetings with Iranian officials and planning a broader regional conflict, the reports claimed.</p>

<h2><strong>Element Of Surprise</strong></h2>

<p>One of the key factors behind the success of Hamas's attack on October 7 was its ability to mislead Israeli intelligence. For nearly two years, Hamas carefully cultivated the impression that it was more focused on governing Gaza and avoiding conflict with Israel. According to the documents, this deception was deliberate, with Hamas leadership frequently discussing the need to lull Israel into a false sense of security.</p>

</div>

<p>In April 2022, after the Muslim holy month of Ramzan passed without major incidents, Hamas leaders expressed relief that they had been able to "camouflage the big idea." According to the findings, by avoiding skirmishes, Hamas convinced Israel that it was not planning a major offensive. The group continued this strategy throughout 2022 and 2023.</p>

<p>To ensure the success of this deception, Hamas kept its plans tightly compartmentalised. Only a select few of its senior commanders, including Sinwar and Ismail Haniyeh, the group's political leader in Qatar, who was recently killed in Tehran, were privy to the full extent of the attack plans. Lower-ranking operatives were not informed until mere hours before the assault, the findings claim.</p>

<h2><strong>The Decision To Strike</strong></h2>

<p>After years of planning and months of preparation, Hamas finally decided to strike on October 7, 2023. The timing was significant: it coincided with Simhat Torah, a Jewish holiday when Israel would be vulnerable due to holiday observances and lower military readiness. The group debated launching the attack earlier, on Yom Kippur in late September, but ultimately chose Simhat Torah as the optimal moment, the findings claim.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On the morning of October 7, Hamas militants crossed into southern Israel, executing a devastating multi-pronged attack. The group's fighters targeted Israeli military bases, and civilian communities, and took hundreds of hostages, many of whom remain in captivity in Gaza.</p>

<p>While Hamas launched the attack without the immediate participation of its regional allies, the conflict quickly escalated beyond Gaza's borders. Within 24 hours of the assault, Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed militant group based in Lebanon, began firing missiles at Israeli positions along the northern border. This opened a second front in the conflict, with the possibility of further escalation involving Iran and its regional proxies.</p>

<h2><strong>What Iran Said&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p>The extent of Iran and Hezbollah's involvement in the October 7 attack remains a subject of debate. Iranian leaders have denied direct involvement, with Ayatollah Ali Khamenei stating that Tehran was not responsible for the planning or execution of the assault. US and Israeli intelligence agencies have also suggested that key Iranian officials may have been caught off-guard by the timing of the attack.</p>

<p>Iran's permanent mission to the United Nations in New York rejected the claims linking Tehran to Hamas' October 7 surprise attack.</p>

<p>The Iranian mission responded to questions from The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal, saying, "While Hamas officials based in (the Qatari capital) Doha have announced that they had no information about the operation and solely Hamas' military wing based in Gaza had been responsible for the planning, deciding about and directing the operation, any claim aiming to partially or entirely link the operation to Iran or Hezbollah is invalid and comes from fabricated documents."&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>SpaceX's next test flight of its Starship megarocket this Sunday could mark a world first: catching the returning first-stage booster using the launch tower's "chopstick" arms -- a crucial step in the company's quest for rapid reusability.</p>

<p>The launch window opens at 7:00 am (1200 GMT) from the company's Starbase in Boca Chica, Texas. A live webcast will be carried on SpaceX's website and its X account.</p>

<p>During its last flight in June, SpaceX achieved its <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/spacexs-megarocket-starship-nails-historic-ocean-splashdown-5835757" target="_blank">first successful splashdown in the Indian Ocean</a> with the upper stage of Starship, a prototype spaceship that the company's founder Elon Musk hopes will one day carry humanity to Mars.</p>

<p>NASA is also keenly awaiting a modified version of Starship to act as a lander vehicle for crewed flights to the Moon under the Artemis program later this decade.</p>

<p>The primary objectives for Sunday's test, Starship's fifth, will be attempting "the first ever return to launch site and catch of the Super Heavy booster, and another Starship reentry and landing burn, aiming for an on-target splashdown of Starship in the Indian Ocean," SpaceX said in a statement.</p>

<p>The company added that its engineers have "spent years preparing and months testing for the booster catch attempt, with technicians pouring tens of thousands of hours into building the infrastructure to maximize our chances for success."</p>

<p>Teams will be monitoring to ensure "thousands" of criteria are met both on the vehicle and at the tower before any attempt to return the Super Heavy booster to the tower and "catch" it.</p>

<p>If these conditions aren't satisfied, the booster will be redirected for a splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico, as in previous tests.</p>

<p>But if things do go to plan, the returning booster will decelerate from supersonic speeds, generating audible sonic booms around the landing site, and the powerful "chopstick arms" will embrace it as it descends about seven minutes after launch.</p>

<p><strong>'Fail fast, learn fast'</strong></p>

<p>The large mechanical arms, called "chopsticks" and even "Mechazilla" by Musk, have generated considerable excitement among space enthusiasts.</p>

<p>Starship stands 397 feet (121 meters) tall with both stages combined -- about 90 feet taller than the Statue of Liberty.</p>

<p>Its Super Heavy booster, which is 233 feet tall, produces 16.7 million pounds (74.3 Meganewtons) of thrust, about twice as powerful as the Saturn V rockets used during the Apollo missions.</p>

<p>SpaceX's "fail fast, learn fast" strategy of rapid iterative testing, even when its rockets blow up spectacularly, has ultimately accelerated development and contributed to the company's success.</p>

<p>Founded only in 2002, it quickly leapfrogged aerospace industry giants and is now the world leader in orbital launches, besides providing the only US spaceship currently certified to carry astronauts.</p>

<p>It has also created the world's biggest internet satellite constellation -- invaluable in disaster and war zones.</p>

<p>But its founding vision of making humanity a multiplanetary species is increasingly at risk of being overshadowed by Musk's embrace of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and his alignment with right-wing politics.</p>

<p>In recent weeks, the company has openly sparred with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) over launch licensing and alleged violations, with Musk accusing the agency of overreach and calling for its chief, Michael Whitaker, to resign.</p>

<p>"He's trying to position himself for minimal regulatory interference with SpaceX once Donald Trump becomes president," said Mark Hass, a marketing expert and professor at Arizona State University. "But it's a calculated gamble if things go the other way."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A woman's honeymoon turned into a nightmare after a terrifying experience at A Haunting in Hollis, a notorious haunted house in New York City. Solainne Moncero-Tannis filed a lawsuit on October 2 in Queens Supreme Court, alleging she suffered two broken ankles while navigating the haunted attraction. Her traumatic experience occurred just two weeks after her wedding.</p>

<p>The 33-year-old's lawsuit claims she was injured on Satan's Slope, a 20-foot slide inside the house. According to her lawyer, Michael Goldberg, the slide “went straight down in complete darkness” and ended abruptly on a concrete surface, as per the <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/10/12/us-news/woman-breaks-both-ankles-in-nyc-haunted-house-lawsuit/">NY Post</a>.</p>

<p>The incident left Ms Moncero-Tannis undergoing surgery and relearning how to walk.</p>

<p>Mr Goldberg also called the haunted house a "real house of horrors" and said that it had been allowed to operate year after year without "proper safety measures, inspections, or even liability insurance", which he suggested the attraction seemed to lack.</p>

<p>The woman told the NY Post, "It's been very difficult for me, psychologically, emotionally, and physically. To this day, I have difficulty navigating stairs and day-to-day activities are not the same for me."</p>

<p>The house, owned by Janette and Lataya Carter, has been at the centre of multiple claims of unsafe conditions. It has a long history of being a popular attraction in the Queens neighbourhood. Four other lawsuits were filed last year against A Haunting in Hollis and its owners, following injuries that occurred in 2022 and 2023. One of the claims also involved someone breaking their ankles on the same slide, Satan's Slope.</p>

<p>This week, the city finally shut down the haunted house due to safety concerns, after officials discovered the building had been "radically altered". FDNY Assistant Chief of Fire Prevention Tom Currao said, "The interior arrangement was totally changed so that anybody in there, in case of an emergency, would have a very hard time getting out."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The mother of three children who vanished with their fugitive father three years ago is now concerned for their safety after they were spotted in New Zealand bushland last week. Cat Phillips fears her daughter may have issued a subtle plea for help when a group of teenage pig hunters encountered her family on a remote coastal farm near Marokopa on October 3.</p>

<p>Tom Phillips, along with his children – Jayda, 11, Maverick, 9 and Ember, 8 – has been missing since September 2021. Initially wanted for failing to appear in court on minor charges, Tom's situation escalated dramatically when he was linked to a bank robbery in May 2023. Despite intensive search efforts involving helicopters and ground teams, the family remains elusive. The most recent sighting occurred on October 3, when a teenage hunter filmed what is believed to be Tom Phillips and his children while hunting in Marokopa, a rural isolated area. This sighting provided a glimmer of hope for their mother, Cat, who has not seen her children since they went missing.</p>

<p>During the encounter, all four were dressed in camouflage and carrying large backpacks, with Tom walking ahead of the children. One of the hunters recalled a brief exchange with Jayda, who responded, “Yeah … duh,” and indicated that only the hunters knew they were there. Ms Cat interpreted this as a potential cry for help, questioning whether her daughter was asking, “Does anybody know that we're here? Is anyone coming for us?”</p>

<p>“It's like she's trying to say something without actually saying it because her father is right there,” Cat Phillips told Mata Reports. “She's worried if she says the wrong thing and words it the wrong way, she's worried about later repercussions.”</p>

<p>Following the sighting, police deployed helicopters, including a military chopper equipped with night vision, to the area. Detective Inspector Andrew Saunders stated that the sighting sparked “a positive line of inquiry.” However, Cat voiced frustration over the authorities' response, noting they only contacted her the day after the footage was reported. “The system has failed my children miserably,” she said. “They shouldn't have to live like this. They deserve friends, parks, and McDonald's.”&nbsp;</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mysterious white blobs have been washing up on Newfoundland's beaches, prompting an investigation by Canadian authorities, <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg56pqdedz6o">BBC </a></em>reported. A local resident Stan Tobin described the blobs as "doughy, like poorly baked bread" with a strong smell similar to vegetable oil. Since early September, beachgoers on the southern tip of the Canadian province have been reporting sightings of the unusual substance, leaving officials scrambling to determine its origin and composition.</p>

<p>Environment and Climate Change Canada ruled out petroleum-based sources, while Fisheries and Oceans Canada's marine ecologist confirmed no biological or sea sponge origin.</p>

<p>Last month,&nbsp;Philip Grace was the first to post a photograph of the&nbsp;lumpy gelatinous blob. He shared an image on the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/2359287820975015/">Facebook page </a>of Beachcombers of Newfoundland and Labrador, asking, ''Anyone know what these blobs are? They are like touton dough and all over the beach.'' The photo sparked intense speculation online, with theories ranging from fungus to ambergris, a rare whale-produced substance valued in perfumery.&nbsp;</p>

<p></p>

<p>Several others reported seeing similar blobs on Shoal Cove<b>&nbsp;</b>Beach, Barasway Beach, Gooseberry Cove Beach, Southern Harbour, and Arnold's Cove.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Local environmentalist Stan Tobin, who regularly walks the beaches near his Ship Cove village home, said he has no clue about it. "It's like someone tried to bake bread and did a lousy job," he said.</p>

<p>Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) launched an investigation into the mysterious globs after receiving reports on September 7, spokesperson Samantha Bayard confirmed. Federal researchers, aided by the Canadian Coast Guard, collected beach samples near St. John's. Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) experts analysed the substances, considering the possibility that the blobs could be aquatic invasive species or whale blubber.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, Nadine Wells, section head of the marine ecological research group at DFO's Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Centre in St. John's negated both possibilities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>''We are fairly certain that the mystery substance that has been getting media attention is not a sea sponge, nor does it have any biological material.&nbsp;The glob or the goo or whatever it is, we don't think it's a sponge because there have been people lighting it on fire and it burns. We figure there must be some type of oil in there,” she said. Meanwhile, the&nbsp;DFO is planning to expand field research to determine&nbsp;the source and composition of the enigmatic blobs.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 41-year-old secretary at Coca-Cola's global headquarters was arrested for attempting to sell highly confidential trade secrets of a new product to Pepsi. Joya Williams, along with her accomplices Ibrahim Dimson and Edmund Duhaney, conspired to sell the stolen Coca-Cola information for a hefty price of USD 1.5 million (Rs. 12.6 crores). The plot, however, backfired when Pepsi, rather than capitalising on the opportunity, reported the illegal offer to Coca-Cola and the FBI.</p>

<p>Williams, who worked as an assistant to Coca-Cola's global brand director, was caught attempting to steal and sell a phial containing a secret new product. The FBI, in a covert operation, posed as Pepsi executives to catch the culprits. During a staged exchange, Dimson handed over confidential Coca-Cola documents and the phial in exchange for $30,000, hidden inside a yellow Girl Scout cookie box. The undercover operation culminated in the arrest of Williams and her accomplices before the completion of their illicit deal.</p>

<p>Public Prosecutor David Nahmias&nbsp;praised&nbsp;Pepsi's decision. “They did so because trade secrets are important to everybody in the business community,” she said, as per the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2006/jul/07/marketingandpr.drink">Guardian</a>. “They realise that if their trade secrets are violated, they all suffer, the market suffers and the community suffers.”</p>

<p>Williams and her accomplices face charges of unlawfully stealing and selling trade secrets. Williams was charged with unlawfully stealing and selling trade secrets. They are accused of writing a letter to Pepsi under the pseudonym “Dirk” in which they demanded an initial payment of USD 10,000 (Rs. 8,41,373) for Coke's internal documents and the phial.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to the reports, the conspirators' note can be read as: “I have information that's all classified and extremely confidential, that only a handful of the top execs at my company have seen. I can even provide actual products and packaging of certain products that no eye has seen, outside of maybe 5 top exe(cutive)s.”</p>

<p>The incident has once again highlighted the fierce rivalry between Coca-Cola and Pepsi. Over the years, the two soft drink giants have engaged in aggressive marketing campaigns, celebrity endorsements, and even product taste challenges.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iran's permanent mission to the United Nations in New York rejected claims linking Tehran to Hamas' October 7 surprise attack on Israel, the state media reported.</p>

<p>In a statement, the Iranian mission responded to questions from The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal regarding Israel's claim of having access to minutes from Hamas' secret meetings, which allegedly indicated Tehran was informed of the group's plan for the October 7 attack, the IRNA reported.</p>

<p>"While Hamas officials based in (the Qatari capital) Doha have announced that they had no information about the operation and solely Hamas' military wing based in Gaza had been responsible for the planning, deciding about and directing the operation, any claim aiming to partially or entirely link the operation to Iran or Hezbollah is invalid and comes from fabricated documents," said the mission, Xinhua news agency reported, quoting IRNA.</p>

<p>The New York Times reported on Saturday that minutes of Hamas' secret meetings, seized by the Israeli military and obtained by the American newspaper, provided a detailed record of the planning for the October 7 attack, as well as the determination of Yahya Sinwar, Hamas' incumbent political bureau chief, to persuade the Palestinian group's allies, Iran and Hezbollah, to join the operation or at least commit to a broader fight with Israel if Hamas staged a surprise cross-border raid.</p>

<p>On October 7, 2023, Hamas launched an unprecedented attack on southern Israel, killing around 1,200 people and taking approximately 250 hostages. In response, the Israeli military has been conducting a large-scale offensive on Gaza.</p>

<p>Iranian officials have consistently stated that while Iran supports Palestinian resistance groups, including Hamas, it had no prior knowledge of the attack on Israel and was not involved in its execution.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thousands of people are trapped in Gaza's Jabalia camp as Israeli forces attack the area,&nbsp;Médecins Sans Frontières(Doctors Without Borders) said on Friday, a week after Israel launched an offensive there which it says is aimed at stopping Hamas regrouping.</p>

<p>At least 20 Palestinians were killed and dozens more were wounded late on Friday by Israeli strikes in Jabalia, which also damaged four nearby homes, medics told Reuters. The death toll is likely to rise, they added.</p>

<p>Israeli military strikes killed at least 61 Palestinians across the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/28-killed-in-israeli-strike-on-gaza-school-6762589">Gaza Strip</a> on Friday, the medics added. Nearly half of the fatalities, including the 20 killed at the home, occurred in Jabalia, the northern district which is the largest of Gaza's historic refugee camps.</p>

<p>The Israeli military says it has killed dozens of militants in Jabalia, though it remains unclear how many of the dead were civilians rather than fighters.</p>

<p>"Nobody is allowed to get in or out; anyone who tries is getting shot," MSF project coordinator Sarah Vuylsteke said on X.</p>

<p>Five MSF staff were trapped in Jabalia, she said.</p>

<p>"I don't know what to do; at any moment we could die. People are starving. I am afraid to stay, and I am also afraid to leave," she quoted Haydar, an MSF driver, as saying.</p>

<p>At least 15 of the fatalities in Jabalia since dawn were due to Israeli strikes targeting various areas, including a school sheltering displaced individuals, the official Palestinian news agency Wafa said, citing medical sources.</p>

<p>Gaza's Civil Defence said dozens were wounded by Israeli quadcopter drone fire at the same school.</p>

<p>There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military, which has previously said Gaza's militants use such shelters for cover. Hamas has denied this.</p>

<p>The Israeli military has sent troops into the nearby towns of Beit Hanoun and Beit Lahiya as well as Jabalia. Hamas has said it will keep fighting Israeli forces.</p>

<p>Palestinian health officials have reported at least 130 deaths in the operation so far, while the military has told residents to evacuate areas where the UN estimates over 400,000 people are trapped.</p>

<p>United Nations officials expressed concern that the ongoing Israeli offensive and evacuation orders in northern Gaza could disrupt the second phase of its polio vaccination campaign set to begin next week.</p>

<p>Healthcare officials have reported that dozens of facilities in Gaza are under evacuation orders from the Israeli military, complicating humanitarian efforts amid the conflict.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nearly a year after a US-Venezuela prisoner exchange raised hopes for improved relations, tensions have resurfaced with the detention of at least four US citizens by Venezuelan authorities.</p>

<p>Announced in September, these detentions are linked to claims by the Venezuelan government that the Americans and other foreign nationals were involved in a CIA and Spanish intelligence plot to overthrow <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-seizes-venezuelan-president-nicolas-maduros-plane-over-violation-of-american-sanctions-6476598">President Nicolas Maduro</a>. Both the US and Spanish governments have firmly denied the accusations.</p>

<p>Venezuela's Interior Minister, Diosdado Cabello, has alleged that the detained individuals, which also include two Spaniards and a Czech national, were part of a unit tasked with assassinating Maduro. He claims the group was motivated by a $15 million reward offered by the US for information leading to Maduro's arrest or conviction. According to Cabello, the plot involved an active US Navy SEAL and a shipment of US-made firearms, which Venezuelan authorities seized.</p>

<p>White House spokesperson John Kirby confirmed that Wilbert Castaneda, identified by Venezuela as the ringleader, is indeed an active US Navy member but insisted his visit to Venezuela was for “personal travel,” reports <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/10/12/americas/analysis-maduro-claims-cia-plot-venezuela-intl-latam/index.html">CNN</a>. Meanwhile, media reports have suggested Castaneda is a dual US-Mexican citizen and was once a Navy SEAL.</p>

<p>While it is difficult to independently verify Venezuela's claims, critics argue that Maduro may be reviving old tactics to gain leverage in ongoing diplomatic tensions. In recent years, Maduro has repeatedly accused the US of meddling in Venezuelan affairs, including a 2018 assassination attempt involving a drone and multiple alleged coup attempts. Although these claims have been consistently denied by Washington, Maduro continues to rally domestic support by portraying the US as a foreign aggressor.</p>

<p>“The administration has made abundantly clear the expectation that additional Americans are not detained,” a US official stated last year when several US citizens were released as part of a prisoner exchange deal with Venezuela. However, with the latest detentions, this fragile truce seems to be unravelling.</p>

<p>Some Venezuelan officials are sceptical about Cabello's claims. “I think these are more loose dogs than a real involvement from the US government,” a source within the Venezuelan government said, referencing the $15 million reward that could attract “crazy adventurers.” However, President Maduro may simply be aiming to use the detainees as pawns in future negotiations, especially with the US election approaching.</p>

<p>Historically, Venezuela has used detained Americans as bargaining chips in diplomatic negotiations, obtaining the release of individuals close to Maduro in exchange for easing sanctions.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

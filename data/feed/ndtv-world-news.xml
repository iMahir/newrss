       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ahead of a game-changing presidential debate, US Vice President and Democratic nominee Kamala Harris walked over to her Republican rival Donald Trump and shook hands with him. This was the first time two US presidential candidates have shaken hands since 2016.</p>

<p>The debate also marks the first time the two candidates have met each other face-to-face.</p>

<p>As the two rivals entered the debate stage, Trump headed to his podium on the left to take his place. Kamala Harris, on the other hand, crossed the stage, walked up to him and held out her hand.</p>

<p>"Kamala Harris, Let's have a good debate," she said as she introduced herself to the former president.</p>

<p>"Nice to see you, let's have fun," Trump replied and the two shook hands.</p>

<p>"Thank you," Harris said.</p>

<p></p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Right off the bat, tonight's debate starts on a different foot than the Biden/Trump debate in June-- Harris goes for a handshake, introducing herself to Trump while saying, "Let's have a good debate."

<p></p>

<p>While there is no rule that require the two candidates to shake hand, it does mark a gesture of civility ahead of what is usually a politically brutal face-off.</p>

<p>The high-stakes debate began with a fiery jab by the 78-year-old Republican who called Harris a "Marxist" and claimed that she and President Joe Biden had allowed "millions of people pouring into our country from prisons and jails, from mental institutions and insane asylums."</p>

<p>Harris jibed the former US president several time by calling him a "convicted felon", "friend of dictators" and saying that he used "race to divide the American people."</p>

<p>She said Trump's own former White House security officials have called him a "disgrace." "World leaders are laughing at Donald Trump," she added.</p>

<p>The crucial debate comes only 56 days before the election in what has been a narrow race to the White house.</p>

<p>The last presidential debate in June resulted in Joe Biden pulling out of his reelection campaign and nominating Harris to take his place instead.</p>

<p>Almost all polls have shown the two candidates in a tight neck-and-neck contest.</p>

<p>The debate proved to be a critical chance for the two rivals to battle it out before the US goes to vote on November 5.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said his Tuesday showdown with Democrat Kamala Harris was his "best debate ever," and accused the ABC network moderators of working against him.</p>

<p>"I thought that was my best Debate, EVER, especially since it was THREE ON ONE!" Trump posted on social media.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Kamala Harris savaged Donald Trump as "extreme" and the friend of dictators, while the Republican branded her a "Marxist" in a bitter televised debate Tuesday that poured fuel on an already explosive US presidential election.</p>

<p>On hot-button issues ranging from abortion and race to the fate of US democracy, the two held their first -- and possibly only -- debate ahead of the November 5 election, with each hoping for a breakthrough in an agonizingly close race.</p>

<p>Trump, who only a few weeks ago had believed himself to be cruising to victory, reacted to pressure from Harris by raising his voice and resorting to the kinds of colorful invective and often meandering insults that he uses at his rallies.</p>

<p>Harris, 59, responded by looking on in amusement, then clearly got under his skin, declaring that she represents a fresh start after the "mess" of the Trump presidency -- and saying: "We're not going back."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Democratic Presidential nominee Kamala Harris presented herself as the face of a new generation of leadership as she reminded her Republican rival Donald Trump that he was contesting against her, and not President Joe Biden.</p>

<p>"It's important to remind the former president you're not running against Joe Biden, you're running against me," she said as Trump focussed most of criticism on Biden at the heated ABC debate.</p>

<p>The Republican criticism has hinged mostly on the unpopular president who dropped out of race midway after a dismal debate performance against Trump in July. Trump used the same playbook in today's debate, trying to attack Harris with criticism against Biden.</p>

<p>The debate began with a formal handshake as Trump and Harris met for the first time, but turned bitter soon. Trump called Biden the worst president in US history and Harris the worst vice president. He further claimed Harris "hates" Biden and is trying to get away from him.</p>

<p>Harris, on the other hand, tried to evoke confidence after a lack of enthusiasm over the Trump-Biden rematch.</p>

<p>"I'm clearly not Joe Biden and certainly not Donald Trump. And what I do offer is a new generation of leadership for our country, one who believes in what is possible. One who brings a sense of optimism about what we can do instead of always disparaging the American people," she said.</p>

<p>Trump criticised Biden over the Russia-Ukraine war, asserting he will get it ended if he wins the elections, but did not answer if Ukraine should win. In response, Kamala Harris said Trump would "give up" Ukraine to Russia as she called Vladimir Putin "a dictator who would eat you (Trump) for lunch."</p>

<p>On the Middle East crisis, Harris voiced support for a two-state solution for Israel and Palestine. Trump said the Democrats hate Israel, but had no specific answer on what he would do to end the war if he gets elected.</p>

<p>Trump also labelled Harris as a "Marxist"; the Vice President laughed it off.</p>

<p>The 2024 election was supposed to be a 2020 rematch. But Harris was passed the baton after President Joe Biden opted out of his re-election bid. If she wins the November polls, Harris will become the first woman president of the US.</p>

<p>Trump was initially leading in national polls, but the entry of Harris changed the game. Latest polls suggest the two leaders are neck and neck with the Democrat maintaining a marginal lead over her Republican rival.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump took the stage on Tuesday night for their first and only scheduled presidential debate before the Nov. 5 election.</p>

<p>Here are some key quotes:</p>

<h3><strong>ECONOMY</strong></h3>

<p>"Look, we've had a terrible economy, because of inflation, which is really known as a country buster," said Trump.</p>

<p>"People can't go out and buy cereal or bacon or eggs or anything else. The people of our country are absolutely dying with what they've done. They've destroyed the economy," said Trump.</p>

<p>"I believe in the ambition, the aspirations, the dreams of the American people, and that is why I imagine and have actually a plan to build what I call an opportunity economy," said Harris.</p>

<p>"My opponent, on the other hand, his plan is to do what he has done before, which is to provide a tax cut for billionaires and big corporations," said Harris.</p>

<h3><strong>ISRAEL-GAZA CONFLICT</strong></h3>

<p>"It must end immediately, and the way it will end is we need a ceasefire deal, and we need the hostages out," said Harris.</p>

<p>"She hates Israel. If she's president, I believe that Israel will not exist within two years from now," said Trump to which Harris responded: "That's absolutely not true. I have my entire career and life supported Israel and the Israeli people."</p>

<h3><strong>WORLD LEADERS</strong></h3>

<p>"World leaders are laughing at Donald Trump," said Harris.</p>

<p>"(Hungarian Prime Minister) Viktor Orban said the most respected, most feared person is Donald Trump. We had no problems when Trump was president," said Trump.</p>

<h3><strong>UKRAINE</strong></h3>

<p>"I want the war to stop. I want to save lives," Trump said when asked if he wanted Ukraine to win the war with Russia.</p>

<p>"If Donald Trump were president, Putin would be sitting in Kyiv right now," said Harris.</p>

<h3><strong>JABS</strong></h3>

<p>"Wait a minute, I'm talking now, if you don't mind, please, does that sound familiar?" said Trump, appearing to refer to Harris' use of "I'm speaking" during the 2020 vice presidential debate against former Vice President Mike Pence.</p>

<p>"It's important to remind the former president, you're not running against Joe Biden, you are running against me," said Harris.</p>

<p>"So she just started by saying she's going to do this, she's going to do that, she's going to do all these wonderful things. Why hasn't she done it? She's been there for three and a half years," said Trump following Harris' closing remarks.</p>

<h3><strong>ABORTION</strong></h3>

<p>"I pledge to you, when Congress passes a bill to put back in place the protections of Roe v Wade as president of the United States, I will proudly sign it into law," said Harris.</p>

<p>"Now, I believe in the exceptions for rape, incest and life of the mother. ... Now states are voting on it. ... Each individual state is voting. It's the vote of the people. Now it's not tied up in the federal government," said Trump.</p>

<h3><strong>IMMIGRATION</strong></h3>

<p>"I'll tell you something, he's going to talk about immigration a lot tonight, even when it's not the subject that is being raised," said Harris.</p>

<p>"Our country is being lost, we're a failing nation," Trump said, referring to people crossing into the country illegally.</p>

<h3><strong>ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT</strong></h3>

<p>"I probably took a bullet to the head for the things they say about me," said Trump.</p>

<h3><strong>TRUTHFULNESS</strong></h3>

<p>"As I said, you're gonna hear a bunch of lies, and that's not actually a surprising fact," said Harris.</p>

<p>"There she goes again. It's a lie," said Trump after Harris said he would sign a national abortion ban were he to win office.</p>

<h3><strong>JOE BIDEN</strong></h3>

<p>"Remember this, she is Biden. She's trying to get away from Biden," said Trump, referring to Harris.</p>

<p>"Clearly, I am not Joe Biden, and certainly not Donald Trump, and what I do offer is a new generation of leadership for our country," said Harris.</p>

<h3><strong>GUNS</strong></h3>

<p>"She has a plan to confiscate everybody's gun," said Trump.</p>

<p>"(Democratic Vice Presidential nominee) Tim Walz and I are both gun owners. We're not taking anybody's guns away," said Harris.</p>

<h3><strong>JAN. 6, 2021, CAPITOL ATTACK</strong></h3>

<p>"I had nothing to do with that, other than they asked me to make a speech," said Trump, when asked if he regretted anything that day.</p>

<p>"I was at the Capitol. I was the vice president-elect. I was also a senator and on that day, the president of the United States incited a violent mob to attack our nation's capital, to desecrate our nation's capital," said Harris.</p>

<h3><strong>COVID-19</strong></h3>

<p>"But what Donald Trump did, let's talk about this, with COVID, is he actually thanked President Xi for what he did during COVID," said Harris.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Democrat Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump met on Tuesday for their first and perhaps only debate, a square-off that could have a significant impact on the Nov. 5 election as polls show a tight race.</p>

<p>Here are the takeaways from the debate:</p>

<h3><strong>RILING HER RIVAL</strong></h3>

<p>Harris made a point to get under Trump's skin, as her campaign had forecast.</p>

<p>She urged viewers to attend a Trump rally, where she said Trump would say bizarre things such as windmills cause cancer (something he has, in fact, said) and where, she taunted, attendees would leave out of exhaustion and boredom.</p>

<p>Trump, who prides himself on the crowds he draws, was clearly riled.</p>

<p>"My rallies, we have the biggest rallies, the most incredible rallies in the history of politics," he said. He accused Harris of busing in attendees to her rallies.</p>

<p>Trump then falsely claimed that immigrants in the country illegally were killing and eating people's pets in the city of Springfield, Ohio, an unsubstantiated claim that has circulated on social media and been amplified by Trump's vice presidential running mate JD Vance.</p>

<p>"In Springfield, they're eating the dogs! The people that came in, they're eating the cats!" Trump said. "They're eating the pets of the people that live there."</p>

<p>City officials in Springfield have said those reports are untrue, which the ABC moderators pointed out after Trump's comments.</p>

<p>"Talk about extreme," Harris responded, laughing.</p>

<h3><strong>PLAYING DEFENSE</strong></h3>

<p>Another of Harris' goals, as a former California prosecutor, was to call Trump out for his past actions, particularly his efforts to overturn the 2020 election.</p>

<p>An hour into the debate, her strategy appeared to be paying off. Trump was continually on the defensive.</p>

<p>Asked about the Jan. 6, 2021, siege of the U.S. Capitol, he insisted he "had nothing to do with that, other than they asked me to make a speech." He also maintained, falsely, that he had won the 2020 election.</p>

<p>Harris used Trump's actions as an argument for the country to turn the page.</p>

<p>"Donald Trump was fired by 81 million people, so let's be clear about that, and clearly he is having a very difficult time processing that, but we cannot afford to have a president of the United States who attempts as he did in the past to upend the will of the voters in a free and fair election," Harris said.</p>

<p>The vice president dug at Trump a little more, saying world leaders were "laughing" at him and calling him a disgrace - language that Trump has employed himself at rallies in reference to how he says other countries view President Joe Biden.</p>

<p>A few minutes later, Trump erupted, claiming Harris had received "no votes" in claiming the Democratic nomination and suggesting she replaced Biden as part of some sort of coup.</p>

<p>"He hates her," Trump said of Biden. "He can't stand her."</p>

<p>The exchanges may have aided Harris' argument that Trump, as she put it, lacks the "temperament" to be president.</p>

<h3><strong>HANDSHAKE</strong></h3>

<p>Heading into the debate, there was a question as to how Harris and Trump, who have never met, would greet each other.</p>

<p>Harris settled the issue, definitively. She walked over to Trump at his podium, extended her hand and introduced herself as "Kamala Harris."</p>

<p>It was a disarming way for Harris to approach a man who had spent weeks insulting her race and gender.</p>

<p>After that, the debate quickly settled into an expected groove. Harris swiftly painted herself as a forward-looking candidate. She predicted Trump at the debate would pull from the "same tired playbook."</p>

<p>"A bunch of lies, grievances and name-calling," Harris said.</p>

<h3><strong>SPARRING ON THE ECONOMY</strong></h3>

<p>In the debate's opening minutes, Trump and Harris went to battle on one of the issues that are top of mind for voters: the economy.</p>

<p>Harris detailed the economic policies she has rolled out in recent weeks, which include a substantial tax credit for small start-ups. Trump focused his comments on tariffs, saying he would protect the American economy from unfair foreign competition.</p>

<p>While both sides got their jabs in, Harris got to speak first on a topic where she trails Trump in terms of voter trust. She appeared to force the former president onto his back foot, and Trump essentially played defence on one of his strongest issues.</p>

<p>"She doesn't have a plan" Trump said, after Harris' opening comments. "It's like Run, Spot, Run."</p>

<h3><strong>A SCHISM ON ABORTION</strong></h3>

<p>The two candidates also engaged in a fractious debate about abortion, an issue where polls show Harris has the upper hand.</p>

<p>Trump defended the U.S. Supreme Court's 2022 ruling that ended constitutional protection for abortion and sent the issue back to individual states, arguing, incorrectly, that it was an outcome desired by both Republicans and Democrats. Democrats have long supported a constitutional right to abortion.</p>

<p>"I did a great service in doing it. It took courage to do it," Trump said.</p>

<p>Trump also contended that some states allow babies to be aborted after birth, a point corrected by ABC News moderator, Linsey Davis.</p>

<p>Harris flashed some outrage at Trump's assertion that abortion becoming a states-rights issue was a popular result, referring to states that have passed restrictive bans.</p>

<p>"This is what people wanted?" Harris asked. "People being denied care in an emergency room because healthcare providers are being afraid of being hauled off to jail?"</p>

<p>Trump was asked whether he would veto a federal abortion ban if one were passed by Congress. He insisted it would never happen, but refused to answer the question definitively.</p>

<h3><strong>'WEAPONIZED' JUSTICE</strong></h3>

<p>In one heated exchange, Trump and Harris accused each other of conspiring to "weaponize" the Justice Department in a bid to go after their enemies.</p>

<p>Trump said the indictments he faces for conspiring to overturn his 2020 election loss and for his mishandling of classified documents - as well as his conviction for forging documents related to hush money payments to a porn star - are all the result of a conspiracy cooked up by Harris and Biden. There is no evidence for that assertion.</p>

<p>Harris shot back by pointing out that Trump has promised to prosecute his enemies if he wins a second term.</p>

<p>"Understand this is someone who has openly said he would terminate, I'm quoting, terminate the Constitution," Harris said.</p>

<p>The exchange underlined how Harris and Trump see the stakes of this election as existential. Both see their opponent as a threat to democracy itself.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A comprehensive catalogue of clouds observed on Mars has unveiled the planet's stunning array of atmospheric phenomena, many of which are unlike anything seen on Earth. Despite its thin atmosphere composed primarily of carbon dioxide, Mars can produce striking cloud formations when conditions are right, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2447266-cloud-atlas-of-mars-reveals-an-atmosphere-unlike-our-own/" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>New Scientist </em></a>reported.</p>

<p>Daniela Tirsch and her colleagues at the German Aerospace Center have compiled a "cloud atlas" using images captured by the European Space Agency's Mars Express probe over two decades to better understand these patterns and their impact on the Martian climate.</p>

<p>Some of the clouds observed resemble their Earthly counterparts, such as gravity wave clouds and cloud streets. These clouds form due to atmospheric disturbances caused by Martian surface features or chaotic currents within the atmosphere. However, Mars' unique atmospheric conditions give rise to clouds that have no terrestrial analogues.</p>

<p>Elongated dust clouds, for instance, are a distinctive feature of the Martian atmosphere. These clouds can stretch for hundreds of kilometres and have a striking reddish hue due to the vast quantities of Martian dust they contain. Additionally, orographic clouds form as air is forced upward by mountains and volcanoes, sometimes mixing with dust or dust storms to create features that mimic volcanic eruptions.</p>

<p>Twilight clouds, which appear near the horizon as the sun rises or sets on Mars, are particularly intriguing. These clouds can take on a variety of forms, from wispy cirrus-like structures to strange, clustered blobs. Their appearance and behaviour are influenced by a combination of factors, including the angle of sunlight, the composition of the atmosphere, and the presence of dust or other particles.</p>

<p>The diversity of cloud formations observed on Mars highlights the complexity of the planet's atmospheric dynamics. By studying these clouds, scientists can gain valuable insights into the Martian climate, the circulation of the atmosphere, and the role of dust in shaping the planet's environment.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Blood on the ground of a dark, cramped tunnel sealed by an iron door, bullets and a chess set are seen in a video released by the Israeli military of the passageway deep underground where it said six slain hostages were held and killed by Hamas.</p>

<p>The video was filmed by the military last Friday, its spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said, as a forensic team investigated the hostage deaths. It was released to the public on Tuesday after it had been viewed by their families and the Israeli security cabinet.</p>

<p>The six hostages were killed on the night of Aug. 29, Hagari said. Their bodies were found and retrieved by Israeli soldiers in the southern Gaza area of Rafah around two days later.</p>

<p>Hagari said at least two Hamas gunmen shot them dead in the tunnel, which is 20 metres (66 ft) below ground, less than 170 centimetres (5.6 ft) high and about 80 centimetres (32 inches) wide. It has an exit shaft used by the militants, below a children's room in a house.</p>

<p>The hostages had likely been held in the dank tunnel, where it is hard to breathe and to stand up straight, for some time, possibly weeks, Hagari said.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">????????? ???????: IDF Spokesperson, RAdm. Daniel Hagari, reveals the underground terrorist tunnel where Hersh, Eden, Carmel, Ori, Alex and Almog were held in brutal conditions and murdered by Hamas. <a href="https://t.co/edlfi4lR8U">pic.twitter.com/edlfi4lR8U</a></p>
â€” Israel Defense Forces (@IDF) <a href="https://twitter.com/IDF/status/1833557217913471348?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 10, 2024</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>A version of the video with English narration shows Kalashnikov rifle magazines, bags containing plastic bottles filled with urine and a bucket in a hole that served as a toilet. Women's clothing is strewn on the ground. The Hebrew version, broadcast live on Israeli television channels, also shows a chess set.</p>

<p>Reuters was not able to independently verify the location or the date when the video was filmed.</p>

<p>Israeli troops were in the area, fighting Hamas militants above ground when the hostages were killed, Hagari said, adding that the soldiers had not been attempting a rescue operation. The military did not have precise verified intelligence about the hostages' presence in the area, he said.</p>

<p>The six dead hostages were two women and four men aged between 23 and 40, five of whom were taken from the Nova dance festival attacked by militants on Oct. 7 last year. One of them was a father whose baby was born after he was taken hostage. The killings have sparked outrage and an outpouring of grief in Israel.</p>

<p>Efforts to secure a ceasefire in Gaza that would include a hostage release deal have faltered, with Israel and Hamas trading blame for the deadlock. Mass protests last week demanded Israeli leaders do more for their release.</p>

<p>Hamas-led fighters took around 250 foreign and Israeli hostages when they burst into Israel on Oct. 7 and killed 1,200 people, according to Israeli tallies. Israel's offensive in Gaza has killed more than 40,000 Palestinians since.</p>

<p>Around 100 hostages remain in Gaza, at least a third of whom are believed dead. More than 100 hostages were released in return for Palestinian prisoners in November and eight have been rescued by Israeli forces.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US Vice President and Democrat presidential candidate Kamala Harris today clashed with former President and Republican rival Donald Trump over several issues faced by Americans.</p>

<p>Ms Harris took on Donald Trump, accusing him of the "worst unemployment crisis in the US, since the Great Depression", adding that the former President had left the United States in a "mess", which her administration has since cleaned up.</p>

<p>She went on to charge Donald Trump for the "worst public health epidemic in a century".</p>

<p>Ms Harris went on a no-holds-barred attack on Donald Trump putting him in a corner over what she called "the worst attack on US's democracy since the Civil War". She slammed the former US President for constantly indulging in "divide and distract tactics".</p>

<p>The United States today is severely polarised on several issues, from immigration and race, to religious intolerance and hate crimes, and Ms Harris blamed Donald Trump for creating such divide in American society.</p>

<p>She targeted him over the 2020 attack on the US Capitol in which thousands of people stormed one of the top institutions of the United States.</p>

<p>The two candidates are facing off today in a closely contested Presidential debate being hosted by ABC News. Tens of thousands of people in the United States and several million more across the world have tuned in to the televised debate.</p>

<p>The timing of the debate is crucial as many states go to early votes days after today's contest. The US Presidential election is exactly eight weeks from today.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Democratic Presidential nominee Kamala Harris has claimed that his Republican rival Donald Trump would sign the national abortion ban if he becomes the President, as the two leaders faced off in the first televised debate in Philadelphia. Trump denied the claim and accused the Democrats of supporting abortions after birth.</p>

<p>"In over 20 years, there are trump abortion bans. They don't make exception even in rape and incest...if Trump becomes president, he will sign the national abortion ban," said Harris.</p>

<p><strong><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-presidential-debate-live-donald-trump-and-kamala-harris-to-face-off-in-1st-televised-debate-6537144">Follow live updates here</a></strong></p>

<p>"She is lying. I'm not signing the ban. There is no reason to sign the ban," responded Trump.</p>

<p>Harris accused him of lying over efforts to end federal protections for abortion and called his policies on reproductive rights "insulting to the women of America."</p>

<p>"Donald Trump hand-selected three members of the United States Supreme Court with the intention that they would undo the protections of Roe v Wade, and they did exactly as he intended," said the Vice President.</p>

<p><strong>Read |&nbsp;</strong><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/donald-trump-kamala-harris-debate-us-elections-2024-donald-trump-repeats-debunked-story-on-migrants-eating-cats-of-residents-6537649">Trump Repeats De-Bunked Migrants Eating "Dogs, Cats" Story. Harris Laughs</a></p>

<p>In 2022, the US Supreme Court ended the constitutional right to abortion that was established by the landmark Roe vs Wade ruling. The 1973 ruling had legalised abortion across the country.</p>

<p>Trump further said the Democrats were radicals who find abortion in the ninth month was alright.</p>

<p>"Democrats are radicals. Her vice-presidential pick - which I believe is a horrible pick - says abortion in the ninth month is absolutely fine. This is an issue that has torn our country apart for 52 years," said the former president.</p>

<p>He further claimed the Democrats supported abortions after birth: "In other words, we'll execute the baby." This was fact-checked as false by the ABC Networks, which is hosting the high-stakes debate. Killing a baby after birth is illegal in all 50 states, it pointed out.</p>

<p>The 2024 election was supposed to be a 2020 rematch. But Harris was passed the baton after President Joe Biden opted out of his re-election bid following a dismal debate performance against Trump in July. If she wins the November polls, Harris will become the first woman president of the US.</p>

<p>Trump was initially leading in national polls, but the entry of Harris changed the game. Latest polls suggest the two leaders are neck and neck with the Democrat maintaining a marginal lead over her Republican rival.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A US jury has awarded $50 million in damages to a man who spent nearly 10 years in prison after being wrongfully convicted of murder, his lawyers said Tuesday.</p>

<p>A federal jury in Chicago on Monday ruled in favour of Marcel Brown, 34, giving the largest award to a single wrongful-conviction plaintiff in US history, Loevy &amp; Loevy, the law firm representing him said.</p>

<p>Brown was arrested and sentenced to 35 years in prison after he was convicted of being an accomplice in the 2008 murder of a 19-year-old man.</p>

<p>But in 2018 the case against him was dropped and he was released after his lawyers presented evidence that the confession had been obtained from him illegally.</p>

<p>According to Loevy &amp; Loevy, "Chicago police officers locked (Brown) in an interrogation room for more than 30 hours, interrogated him relentlessly, deprived him of food, denied his repeated requests for a phone call, and prevented him from sleeping."</p>

<p>After a two-week trial in Chicago, the jury unanimously agreed with Brown's defence team "that the police coerced his statement and fabricated evidence," the law firm said in its statement.</p>

<p>The jury awarded Brown $10 million in compensatory damages for the time between his arrest and conviction, and $40 million in damages for his time in prison and after.</p>

<p>"Justice was finally served for me and my family today," &nbsp;Brown said outside the court, according to his lawyers.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iraqi security forces said an explosion was heard at a US-led coalition's military base at the Baghdad International Airport late Tuesday, a day before Iran's president was due to visit.</p>

<p>"At 23:00 (2000 GMT) an explosion was heard inside Baghdad International Airport in the area occupied by international coalition advisors," according to a statement posted on social media platform X by the spokesman for the Joint Operations Command, Iraqi Major General Tahseen Al Khafaji.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Iraqi security forces were unable ... to determine the origin of the explosion, which has not been claimed," according to the statement, which was attributed to Iraqi security forces and also published by state news agency INA.</p>

<p>Air traffic was unaffected and no flights were interrupted, it added.</p>

<p>A senior military official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told AFP that "two Katyusha-type rockets" had caused the explosion.</p>

<p>"One fell on the wall of the Iraqi anti-terrorist forces compound. The second was inside the base hosting the international anti-jihadist coalition led by Washington," said the official.</p>

<p>Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian was expected in Iraq on Wednesday in his first trip abroad since taking office in July.</p>

<p>Relations between Iran and Iraq, both Shiite-majority countries, have grown closer over the past two decades.</p>

<p>Tehran is one of Iraq's leading trade partners and wields considerable political influence in Baghdad where its Iraqi allies dominate parliament and the current government.</p>

<p>A spokesperson for the Iranian-backed Ketaeb Hezbollah (Hezbollah Brigades) armed group in Iraq slammed what he called "an attack" that aimed to "disrupt the Iranian president's visit to Baghdad".&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a post on X, the spokesperson Jaafar al-Husseini called on the Iraqi security services to identify the perpetrators.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Over the past year, US-led coalition forces have been targeted dozens of times with drones and rocket fire in both Iraq and Syria as violence related to the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza has drawn in Iran-backed armed groups across the Middle East.</p>

<p>US forces have carried out multiple retaliatory strikes against these groups in both countries.</p>

<p>To defuse the situation and spare Iraq from the fallout of regional tensions, the United States and Iraq have been negotiating a phased pull-out of US-led anti-jihadist forces.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The United States has deployed around 2,500 troops in Iraq and 900 in Syria as part of the international coalition against the Islamic State group.</p>

<p>Iraqi security forces say they are capable of tackling IS remnants unassisted, as the group poses no significant threat.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Western powers on Tuesday announced fresh sanctions on Iran for supplying Russia with short-range missiles for imminent use against Ukraine, calling it a dangerous escalation of the conflict that threatened European security.</p>

<p>Britain, France and Germany said they would cut aviation agreements with the Islamic Republic and sanction its national carrier Iran Air, claiming Tehran had repeatedly defied warnings about the weapons transfers.</p>

<p>"This act is an escalation by both Iran and Russia and is a direct threat to European security," the so-called E3 powers said in a joint statement.</p>

<p>President Joe Biden meanwhile said the United States was considering lifting restrictions on Ukraine using long-range, US-made missiles against Russia to help it defend itself in return.</p>

<p>"We're working that out right now," Biden told reporters at the White House.</p>

<p>On a visit to London, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned that the Iranian missiles could be used against Ukraine "within weeks".</p>

<p>Dozens of Russian military personnel have trained in Iran using the Fath-360 missile, which has a range of 75 miles (120 kilometres), he added.</p>

<p>The British government announced soon afterwards that it had already begun "the termination of all direct air services between the UK and Iran".</p>

<p>Washington accused Iran Air of "operating or having operated in the transportation sector of the Russian Federation economy", sanctioning it and 10 individuals and companies involved in the supply.</p>

<h3><strong>'False and misleading'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>The move was dismissed In Iran, where foreign ministry spokesman Nasser Kanani said the Western claims were false and a distraction from US backing for Israel in its war against Hamas militants.</p>

<p>"Spreading false and misleading news about the transfer of Iranian weapons to some countries is just an ugly propaganda and lie with the aim of concealing the dimensions of the massive illegal arms support of the United States and some Western countries for the genocide in the Gaza Strip," he added.</p>

<p>On Ukraine, the State Department said that Blinken would travel to Kyiv on Wednesday in a solidarity trip with UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy, as Ukrainian forces face Russian advances in the east.</p>

<p>Moscow has stepped up its aerial attacks in recent weeks but is also trying to fight off a major Ukrainian cross-border offensive into its western Kursk region, which has reshaped the course of the two-and-a-half-year war.</p>

<p>Lammy said the joint trip demonstrated the two countries' commitment to Ukraine and comes before UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer visits the White House on Friday.</p>

<p>Since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Britain has been at the forefront of pushing for more assistance to Kyiv, including loosening restrictions on the use of Western weapons on Russian territory.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Asked about reports that Britain is waiting for a US green light to let Ukraine use long-range Storm Shadow missiles against Russia, Lammy said he would not discuss "operational issues" as "the only person who could benefit" was Russian President Vladimir Putin.</p>

<p>Last week, the UK said that it would send Ukraine 650 new specialist missile systems after President Volodymyr Zelensky complained of slow deliveries from the West.</p>

<h3><strong>'Special relationship'</strong></h3>

<p>The US-UK "special relationship" has persevered across partisan lines since Starmer's Labour ended the Conservatives' 14 years in power in July.</p>

<p>But for Starmer, a full alignment with President Joe Biden's Democratic Party agenda could carry risks just two months before US elections in which Biden's political heir Kamala Harris is running neck and neck in polls with Republican Donald Trump.</p>

<p>While backing Ukraine, Starmer, a former human rights lawyer, has taken a harder line than the Conservatives on Israel, which relies on the United States as its foremost backer in the Gaza war.</p>

<p>His Labour government last week announced restrictions on some weapons to Israel, voicing concern that they could be used to violate international humanitarian law.</p>

<p>The Labour government has also dropped its Conservative predecessor's plans to challenge the right of the International Criminal Court to seek the arrest of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Eight weeks before the United States votes, Republic presidential candidate Donald Trump and his Democrat opponent Kamala Harris are now facing off in the presidential debate.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From abortions to wars to the economy to the housing crisis, US presidential candidates Donald Trump and Kamala Harris battled it out at their first presidential debate hosted by ABC news today.&nbsp; Eight weeks to go before the United States votes, the Republican candidate and the Democrat opponent met on the debate stage.&nbsp;At the start of the debate, Harris and Trump shook hands after they were introduced, ending an eight-year streak of no handshakes on the presidential debate stage.</p>

<p>Interestingly, this is also the first time the two leaders met, and Ms Harris made a point to introduce herself to Mr Trump.</p>

<p>Asked to respond to a question on the economy and the cost of living, an issue high on voters' minds, Ms Harris spoke of her middle-class background and her plans to support families and small businesses if elected to the top post. Targeting Trump, she said he would provide tax cuts to "billionaires and big corporations" and also reminded the viewers of the condition he left the economy in when Joe Biden took over. At one point, Ms Harris said, "Donald Trump has no plan for you."</p>

<p>As the debate heated up, Trump started targeting Harris on the Biden administration's record on immigration, she responded, "You're going to hear from the same old tired playbook, a bunch of lies, grievances and name-calling."</p>

<p>"Let's talk about what Donald Trump left us. Donald Trump left us worst unemployment since the great depression. Donald Trump left us the worst public health epidemic in a century. Donald Trump left us the worst attack on our democracy since the Civil War. And what we have done is clean up Donald Trump's mess," she said.</p>

<p>At one point, Trump switched to a personal attack. "She is a Marxist. Her father was a Marxist." Harris was seen smiling throughout. The former President complained that he did not get enough credit for the "great job" during the Covid pandemic. "We did a phenomenal job with the pandemic," he said.</p>

<p>Moving to the key subject of abortion, Harris warned that Donald Trump will ban abortions if he returns as President. "She is lying," he replied. Trump appeared to be stumped by a question on whether he would veto a national abortion ban. He said such a law won't pass the Congress.</p>

<p>As the focus shifted to immigration, Harris said Trump would be talking about this subject a lot. She invited people to attend Trump's rallies because it's "a really interesting thing to watch". She said at the former President's rallies, he talks about fictional characters like Hannibal Lecter and that people start leaving his rallies because they are bored.</p>

<p>A livid Trump responded that no one goes to Harris' rallies. Trump then started talking about a social media conspiracy theory about Haitian immigrants eating dogs in Ohio.&nbsp;"In Springfield, they're eating the dogs. The people that came in, they're eating the cats. They're eating - they're eating the pets of the people that live there."&nbsp;This got a laugh out of Harris as she shook her head.</p>

<p>As Trump attacked the Joe Biden administration's record on crime control, Harris responded that the remarks were "so rich" coming from someone criminally charged multiple times. Trump said the cases against them were an example of the weaponisation of the Department of Justice to target a political opponent. He then brought up the July 13 assassination attempt, saying "I probably took a bullet to the head because of the things" they (Democrats) have said about him. "They talk about democracy, I'm a threat to democracy. They're the threat to democracy," he said.</p>

<p>"I have travelled the world as Vice-President of the United States. World leaders are laughing at Donald Trump. They say you are a disgrace," Harris said, drawing a rant from the former President.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza, Harris batted for a two-state solution. Trump said the situation would have never reached this point if he was President. He said Harris hates Israel as well as the Arab population in the region. The vice president responded that Trump's claims were not true and stressed her support for Israel.</p>

<p>During an exchange on the Ukraine war, Harris said Russian President Vladimir Putin would be in Kyiv if Trump was president.&nbsp;Harris said Trump would "give up" in the face of pressure from Putin. "Putin would be sitting in Kyiv with his eyes on the rest of Europe, starting with Poland. How quickly you would give up for the sake of favour and what you think is a friendship with what is known to be a dictator who would eat you for lunch."&nbsp;</p>

<p>To a question on whether he wants Ukraine to win its war against Russia, Trump did not have a direct answer but said he wants the war to stop. "I think it's in the US' best interest to get this war finished."</p>

<p>As Trump constantly brought up the Biden administration's failures, trying to tie Harris to them, the vice president responded, "You are not running against Biden."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Asked why he had questioned Harris's racial identity, Trump replied, "I don't care what she is." He said he had read that she was not Black. Harris calls it a "tragedy" that Trump tries to use racial identity to divide Americans. She said she is neither Biden nor Trump and represents a new generation of leadership. Trump responded that the current administration is "divisive".</p>

       <description><![CDATA[US tech giant Amazon is to invest $10.5 billion in Britain over the next five years, creating thousands of jobs via its web services arm, the company and UK government announced Wednesday.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US tech giant Amazon is to invest Â£8 billion ($10.5 billion) in Britain over the next five years, creating thousands of jobs via its web services arm, the company and UK government announced Wednesday.</p>

<p>The announcement is a welcome boon for Britain's recently elected Labour government, which has put firing economic growth at the heart of its pledge to "rebuild" the country.</p>

<p>The investment -- to build, operate and maintain data centres in the UK -- could contribute Â£14 billion to the country's gross domestic product (GDP) and "support" more than 14,000 jobs annually across the supply chain, Amazon said.</p>

<p>It is the firm's latest announcement of a large investment in a European country by its AWS cloud computing division, and comes amid debate within the European Union about "cloud" computing services.</p>

<p>"This Â£8 billion investment marks the start of the economic revival and shows Britain is a place to do business," UK finance minister Rachel Reeves said in a statement.</p>

<p>"I am determined to go further so we can deliver on our mandate to create jobs, unlock investment and make every part of Britain better off.</p>

<p>"The hard work to fix the foundations of our economy has only just begun."</p>

<p>Amazon said the money will be spent expanding the operations of its Amazon Web Services (AWS) subsidiary.</p>

<p>The e-commerce behemoth is seeking to capitalise on the rising demand for cloud computing capacity such as server space.</p>

<p><strong>- 'Pivotal' -</strong></p>

<p>UK government agencies and companies such as airline easyJet, bank Natwest and Sainsbury's supermarket already use AWS data centres, like many of the world's top companies.</p>

<p>"The next few years could be among the most pivotal for the UK's digital and economic future," said Tanuja Randery, AWS Vice President and Managing Director, Europe, Middle East &amp; Africa.</p>

<p>He added AWS' expansion would help "organisations of all sizes across the country increasingly embrace technologies like cloud computing and AI to help them accelerate innovation, increase productivity, and compete on the global stage".</p>

<p>In recent months, the subsidiary has announced it is set to invest tens of billion of euros in Germany, Spain and France.</p>

<p>It comes amid discussions in the EU about a "European sovereign cloud" which would allow the storage and processing of data online without going through American technology giants.</p>

<p>Amazon employs 75,000 people in Britain, at more than 100 sites. It said in its press release that it has invested Â£56 billion in the country between 2010 and 2022.</p>

<p>The company announced last month that it had doubled its quarterly profits, driven by the cloud and AI.</p>

<p>AWS revenue grew 19 percent to $26.3 billion in the second quarter.</p>

<p>Amazon is the world's number one cloud provider but has fallen behind the two other giants in the sector, Microsoft and Google, in generative AI.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Executives from major tech firms like Google, Adobe, Microsoft and Meta Platforms will testify next week at a U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee hearing on election threats.</p>

<p>Google parent Alphabet's global affairs president Kent Walker, Meta's global affairs president Nick Clegg, Microsoft President Brad Smith and a representative from Adobe will testify at the Sept. 18 hearing, a spokesperson from the office of Senator Mark Warner, who chairs the panel, confirmed.</p>

<p>U.S. officials have been attempting to crack down on efforts to spread disinformation and misinformation online surrounding the Nov. 5 election in which Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris and Republican former President Donald Trump will face off. Polls show a tight contest.</p>

<p>Previous U.S. intelligence assessments have said that Russia, Iran and China have tried to meddle in American elections, allegations which those nations deny. Those nations have alleged that Washington interferes in their domestic affairs, claims that the U.S. denies.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Crowds of protesters invaded Mexico's Senate on Tuesday, forcing lawmakers to suspend a debate on controversial proposals by outgoing President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador to allow voters to elect judges.</p>

<p>The judicial reform plan, which experts say would make Mexico the world's only country to elect all judges, has sparked mass demonstrations, diplomatic tensions and investor jitters.</p>

<p>Senate president Gerardo Fernandez Norona declared an "indefinite recess" because demonstrators had entered the building, as television images showed crowds of protesters inside the upper house chamber.</p>

<p>Upper house lawmakers began discussing the proposals Tuesday ahead of a vote that had been expected to be held later in the day or Wednesday.</p>

<p>Lopez Obrador, who wants the bill to be passed before he is replaced by close ally Claudia Sheinbaum on October 1, argues that in the current system the courts serve the interests of the political and economic elite, calling the judiciary "rotten," corrupt and rife with nepotism.</p>

<p>"What most worries those who are against this reform is that they will lose their privileges, because the judiciary is at the service of the powerful, at the service of white-collar crime," the leftist leader said at a news conference.</p>

<p>Opponents, including court employees and law students, have held a series of protests against the plan, under which even Supreme Court and other high-level judges, as well as those at the local level, would be chosen by popular vote.</p>

<p>Serving judges would have to stand for election in 2025 or 2027.</p>

<p>"This does not exist in any other country," said Margaret Satterthwaite, United Nations special rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers.</p>

<p>"In some countries, such as the US, some state judges are elected, and in others, such as in Bolivia, high-level judges are elected. If this reform passes, it will place Mexico in a unique position in terms of its method for judicial selection," she told AFP.</p>

<p><strong>- 'Demolition of judiciary' -</strong><br />
In an unusual public warning, Supreme Court chief justice Norma Pina said that elected judges could be more vulnerable to pressure from criminals, in a country where powerful drug cartels regularly use bribery and intimidation to influence officials.</p>

<p>"The demolition of the judiciary is not the way forward," she said in a video released on Sunday.</p>

<p>Pina said last week that the top court would discuss whether it has jurisdiction to halt the reforms, though Lopez Obrador has said there is no legal basis for it to do so.</p>

<p>The reforms were passed last week in the lower house by ruling party lawmakers and their allies, who were forced to gather in a sports center because access to Congress was blocked by protesters.</p>

<p>In the upper house, the ruling coalition is one seat short of 86 votes for a two-thirds majority needed to amend the constitution.</p>

<p>In a move that could potentially tip the balance in favor of the ruling coalition, one opposition senator was allowed to be excused for health reasons and be replaced by his father, prompting cries of "traitor" in the chamber.</p>

<p><strong>- 'Dangerous proposals' -</strong><br />
The United States, Mexico's main trading partner, has warned that the reforms would threaten a relationship that relies on investor confidence in the Mexican legal framework.</p>

<p>The changes could pose "a major risk" to Mexican democracy and enable criminals to exploit "politically motivated and inexperienced judges," US Ambassador Ken Salazar said last month.</p>

<p>Satterthwaite has also voiced "deep concerns" about the plan, calling access to an independent and impartial judiciary "a human right essential for protecting rights and checking power abuses."</p>

<p>"Without strong safeguards to guard against the infiltration of organized crime (in the judicial selection process), an election system may become vulnerable to such powerful forces," she warned.</p>

<p>Human Rights Watch has urged lawmakers to reject what it called the "dangerous proposals," saying they would "seriously undermine judicial independence and contravene international human rights standards."</p>

<p>Financial market analysts say investor concerns about the reforms have contributed to a sharp fall in the value of the Mexican currency, the peso, which has hit a two-year low against the dollar.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a pivotal moment for the US presidential election campaign, former President Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Kamala Harris faced off in their first televised debate shortly in Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>Kamala Harris, 59, who holds a significant edge among women voters according to recent polls, challenged Trump on reproductive rights, especially given his recent, seemingly contradictory statements on abortion.</p>

<p>Conversely, Trump targetted Harris on issues such as the economy and immigration.</p>

<p>The race for the White House between Kamala Harris, who is Black and South Asian, and Donald Trump appears to be neck-and-neck, with the latest polls showing Trump leading Harris 48% to 47% nationally.</p>

<p>According to AFP, Harris has spent the past five days in intensive debate preparations, sequestered in a hotel. In contrast, the Trump team has indicated that the former president has taken a more relaxed approach in the lead-up to the debate.</p>

<p>The debate is scheduled to last 90 minutes and will be held without an audience.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Israeli military has said it had killed three senior Hamas militants in strikes on a designated safe zone in southern Gaza.</p>

<p>The strikes targeted a crowded tent camp housing displaced Palestinians in the Mawasi area of Khan Younis, killing at least 19 people, with more being trapped under the rubble, according to Gaza-based health authorities.</p>

<p>Video footage on social media showed dozens of tents caught on fire and large craters resulting from the strikes.</p>

<p>The Israeli military confirmed in a statement on Tuesday that it attacked the location, describing it as an intelligence-based "precise strike" targeting "senior Hamas terrorists operating within a command and control centre embedded inside the humanitarian area in Khan Younis", Xinhua news agency reported.</p>

<p>According to the Israeli military, the strikes killed Samer Ismail Khadr Abu Daqqa, head of Hamas's aerial unit in the Gaza Strip, Osama Tabesh, head of the observation and targets department in Hamas's military intelligence headquarters, and Ayman Mabhouh, a senior Hamas militant.</p>

<p>The three militants were "directly involved" in the Hamas attack on southern Israel on October 7, 2023, and had been "recently planning terror activities against the Israel Defense Forces and the State of Israel," the military said.</p>

<p>Later, the Israeli army conducted another attack on the Al-Farouq Mosque in the Bureij refugee camp in central Gaza. The army said the attack aimed to destroy another Hamas command and control centre located within the mosque.</p>

<p>The Palestinian news agency Quds News reported an unspecified number of casualties and injuries in Bureij.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

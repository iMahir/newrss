       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri on Thursday said that the upcoming visit by Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the Quad summit emphasises several important aspects, including bilateral, plurilateral and multilateral, and asserted that the agenda of the summit includes developing Indo-Pacific region, and implementing Sustainable Development Goals.</p>

<p>The remarks by Mr Misri came during a briefing by the Ministry of External Affairs on Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to the United States for the upcoming Quad summit.</p>

<p>Elaborating on the events which will be taking place in the US during PM Modi's visit, Mr Misri said, "PM Modi will be visiting the US from September 21-23. This visit combines very important aspects. It has very important bilateral aspect to it, very important plurilateral aspects to it and equally important multilateral aspect to it. There will be interaction with a variety of foreign partners at the level of the Prime Minister. There will be interaction with the large Indian community in the US. And there will be engagement with a host of business and industry leaders, amongst others."</p>

<p>He added, "PM's first talk will be in Wilmington, Delaware, which is the hometown of President Joe Biden. That is also the venue of this sixth Quad summit..."</p>

<p>Mr Misri further informed that from Wilmington, the PM will travel to New York, to attend the Summit of the Future. He said, "He (PM Modi) will also have a number of engagements throughout these three days. On September 21, there will be Quad summit; the bilateral meetings on the sidelines of the Quad summit. A special event on the sidelines of Quad summit will be Cancer Moonshot event. On September 22, PM will have an interaction with the Indian community. This is being organised by the community in Long Island, New York..."</p>

<p>Speaking on the objective of the Cancer Moonshot initiative, Mr Misri said, "Through the Cancer Moonshot initiative, the Quad aims to implement innovative strategies to prevent, detect, treat, and alleviate the impact of cancer on patients and their families, and to begin with, we intend to collaborate to reduce the burden of cervical cancer in the Indo-Pacific region."</p>

<p>The Foreign Secretary also said that PM Modi will engage with several tech CEOs during his three day visit. "There will be a technology roundtable with a number of tech CEOs where we will have the opportunity to discuss the tech investment landscape and the opportunities that are available here," Mr Misri said. "There will be several other meetings with stakeholders and bilateral meetings with head of states," he added.</p>

<p>"On September 23, PM will address the Summit of the Future in the United Nations General Assembly. There are a few more bilateral meetings that are being fixed up on that day," Mr Misri informed.</p>

<p>Elaborating on the agenda of Quad, Mr Misri said that the Quad's constructive agenda continues to "develop the Indo-Pacific, implementing Sustainable Development Goals, delivering public goods, and having a strong focus on peace, prosperity and stability in the Indo-Pacific region."</p>

<p>He added, "Our agenda includes covering health security, climate change, critical and emerging technology, HADR, connectivity, maritime security, and counter-terrorism."</p>

<p>The Foreign Secretary also noted that the upcoming visit offers the Quad leaders, the opportunity to view progress achieved in the last one year and set the agenda for the next year.</p>

<p>Elaborating on the bilateral meetings with President Biden, Mr Misri said that the India and US will exchange agreements. "At the bilarteral meeting with President Joe Biden, there will be an opportunity for both sides to exchange a few agreements -- Indo-Pacific economy related framework agreements, and India-US drug framework," Mr Misri said.</p>

<p>On the possibility of meeting with former US President Donald Trump, Mr Misri said, "There are many meetings with the Prime Minister right now which we are trying to fix. Right now, I will not be able to tell you about any specific meeting, whether the meeting has been fixed or not. We are looking from all angles as to how much time we have and with whom we can hold meetings. We will keep updating you about the meetings."</p>

<p>Notably, Prime Minister Narendra Modi will visit the United States from September 21 to 23 during which he will take part in the Quad Summit and address the 'Summit of the Future' at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.</p>

<p>PM Modi will take part in the fourth Quad Leaders' Summit in Wilmington, Delaware, which is being hosted by US President Joe Biden on September 21. Following the request of the US side to host the Quad Summit this year, India has agreed to host the next Quad Summit in 2025.</p>

<p>At the Quad Summit, the leaders will review the progress achieved by the Quad over the last one year and set the agenda for the year ahead to assist the countries of the Indo-Pacific region in meeting their development goals and aspirations, a Ministry of External Affairs release said.</p>

<p>PM Modi will address 'Summit of the Future' at the United Nations General Assembly in New York on September 23. The theme of the Summit is 'Multilateral Solutions for a Better Tomorrow'.</p>

<p>Quad is a diplomatic partnership between four countries--Australia, India, Japan, and the United States. It is pertinent to note that in recent years, Quad Foreign Ministers have met eight times, and Quad governments continue to meet and coordinate at all levels.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Backed by Iran and hated by Israel, Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah is Lebanon's most powerful man.</p>

<p>He enjoys cult status among his Shiite supporters, is equipped with a formidable arsenal far bigger and more modern than the national army's, and holds sway over the country's institutions.</p>

<p>Nasrallah has rarely been seen in public since his Shiite movement fought a devastating 2006 war pitting his fighters against Israeli troops.</p>

<p>No one knows where he lives, and the vast majority of his speeches in the past two decades have been televised from a secret location.</p>

<p>The 64-year-old delivered his latest such speech on Thursday, after the communications devices of hundreds of Hezbollah's operatives exploded in an unprecedented attack that the group blamed on Israel.</p>

<p>A gifted public speaker, Nasrallah is a master of cadence, swinging from humour to belittle his enemies to rage to fire up his 100,000-man militia.</p>

<p>The bearded, bespectacled cleric is never seen without traditional robes and the black turban that marks him out as a descendant of the prophet Mohammed.</p>

<p>He is married and has four surviving children. His eldest son Hadi was killed during a military operation against Israeli troops in south Lebanon in 1997.</p>

<p>He was elected secretary general of Hezbollah in 1992, aged just 32, after an Israeli helicopter gunship killed his predecessor Abbas al-Musawi.</p>

<p>Hezbollah is the only group that refused to give up its weapons after Lebanon's 15-year civil war ended in 1990, and Nasrallah insists that Israel remains an existential threat.</p>

<p>Since Hezbollah's Palestinian ally Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, Hezbollah has battled Israeli troops almost daily along the Lebanon-Israel border.</p>

<p>The unprecedented attacks that this week saw hundreds of Hezbollah members' pagers and walkie-talkies explode across Lebanon on Tuesday and Wednesday have put Nasrallah under huge pressure to respond.</p>

<p><strong>'Divine victory'</strong></p>

<p>Born in Beirut's impoverished northern suburb of Burj Hammud on August 31, 1960, he was one of nine children of a poor grocer hailing from the tiny southern village of Bazuriyeh.</p>

<p>Nasrallah studied both politics and the Koran for three years at a seminary in the Iraqi Shiite holy city of Najaf, before being expelled in 1978 when the Sunni-dominated government turned on Shiite activists.</p>

<p>He then became heavily involved in Lebanese politics and gained much of his early experience in the Shiite Amal militia during the civil war.</p>

<p>But he broke away from Amal when Israeli troops marched on Beirut in 1982 to become one of the founders of Hezbollah.</p>

<p>He acquired his cult status in Lebanon and across the Arab world after Israel withdrew its troops from south Lebanon under relentless Hezbollah attack in May 2000, ending 22 years of occupation of the border strip.</p>

<p>Nasrallah's years at the helm of Hezbollah, or Party of God, have seen the group expand from guerrilla faction into the country's most powerful political force.</p>

<p>Hezbollah is admired by many Shiites in Lebanon for supporting local charities, building up health and education services in its strongholds and assisting the needy among its supporters.</p>

<p>Nasrallah's personal popularity soared across the Arab world after a UN-brokered ceasefire ended the 2006 conflict with Israel, with supporters handing out posters bearing his photograph and declaring "divine victory."</p>

<p>But in divided Lebanon, the movement is also widely hated, including by those who dream of a nation free from sectarianism and where the rule of law prevails.</p>

<p>His reputation in the Arab world took a major blow during the Arab Spring protests of 2011, when he sent fighters to neighbouring Syria to prop up President Bashar al-Assad's regime.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah warned Israel of "just punishment" after 32 were killed and over 3,000 were injured in a series of explosions on two consecutive days. Israel has not commented on the attacks.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<ul>
	<li>The attacks were a "massacre" that "could be a war crime or a declaration of war," he said, accusing Israel of having wanted to "kill no less than 5,000 people in two minutes".</li>
	<li>Lebanon lies north of Israel and daily fighting has resulted in the displacement of thousands of residents from its northern region and Israeli officials promised people to return to their homes.</li>
	<li>Israeli Defence Minister, Yoav Gallant, said, "The centre of gravity is moving northward -- resources are being allocated." Hezbollah is fighting Tel Aviv over its war in Gaza which has killed over 40,000.</li>
	<li>Hezbollah chief said, "They will not stop until the aggression on Gaza stops". It comes along with a warning to Israel that they will not be "able to return the people of the north to the north" unless they "stop the war in Gaza".</li>
	<li>Hezbollah is an ally of the Palestinian militant group Hamas, which has been fighting a war in Gaza since its October 7 attack on Israel.</li>
	<li>Today, Lebanese state media reported that Israeli fighters broke the sound barrier over the capital Beirut, i.e., fighter jets went supersonic at the same time when the Hezbollah chief was speaking.</li>
	<li>Israel said two of its soldiers were killed near the border with Lebanon today, while Hezbollah claimed that 25 of its members were killed following explosions, news agency AFP reported. Lebanese media reported Israeli strikes and shelling on towns in its south.</li>
	<li>While Israel's war drags to its 11th month, pager and walkie-talkie explosions in its "enemy" in the north have opened another front triggering concerns of an all-out war.</li>
	<li>The New York Times spoke to three Israeli intelligence officers who said BAC Consulting, a Hungary-based manufacturer of pagers, was a shell company set up by Mossad to rig the devices at the source before shipping them to Lebanon.</li>
	<li>US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has warned against any escalation of the war in the Middle East. "France and the United States are united in calling for restraint and urging de-escalation when it comes to the Middle East in general and when it comes to Lebanon in particular," he said.</li>

       <description><![CDATA[In 1960, Brazilian cattle baron Celso Garcia Sid imported a bull named Krishna from India, a gift from the Maharaja of Bhavnagar, to improve Brazil's cattle breeding.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In 1958, Brazilian cattle baron Celso Garcia Sid sent cowboy Ildefonso dos Santos to India to find a bull that could enhance Brazilian livestock, according to <em>the BBC.</em> Cid was browsing through photographs when he fell in love with a calf named Krishna: his coats were reddish white and his horns hung downward. Cid immediately ordered the purchase of this wonder bull. That was in 1960 when the wonder bull from India arrived in Brazil.</p>

<p>During that time the cowboy had described him as "colossus". "Nothing that is said about this animal can reveal anything-it is a colossus," he had said.</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/portuguese/brasil-44730087"><em>BBC</em></a>, Krishna, gifted by the Maharaja of Bhavnagar, proved to be a genetic revolution in Brazil cattle market, with an elevated value to the Gir breed that is now counted as one of the most valuable breeds in the bovine embryo market. His lineage forms 80% of Brazil's milk production. The government of India has even approached Brazil seeking help to import the breed back into India, from where the breed nearly vanished due to failed crossbreeding attempts.</p>

<p>According to Guilherme Sachetim, grandson of Cid, Krishna is the turning point in the history of livestock farming in Brazil. "He renewed the national dairy cattle's blood at the time when inbreeding was restraining productivity," he said.</p>

<p>In fact, the advancement of genetic improvement techniques enabled Krishna's high-performance DNA to spread in all directions throughout Brazil. "Millions of people have enjoyed this import," he told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/portuguese/brasil-44730087"><em>BBC</em></a>.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="The Preserved Legacy of Gir Bull Krishna and Celso Garcia Cid." id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-09/8hjii1i_the-preserved-legacy-of-gir-bull-krishna-and-celso-garcia-cid_625x300_19_September_24.jpg?im=FitAndFill,algorithm=dnn,width=1200,height=738" title="The Preserved Legacy of Gir Bull Krishna and Celso Garcia Cid." /></div>

<p class="ins_instory_dv_caption">The Preserved Legacy of Gir Bull Krishna and Celso Garcia Cid.</p>
</div>

<p>The tale of Krishna links Brazil to India's glorious heritage of cattle breeding during the Maharajas' regime who came up with such breeds that are resistant to lion attacks. The legacy of Krishna continues to shape Brazil's dairy industry, however, for the betterment of millions across Americas.</p>

<p>This friendship with the Maharaja of Bhavnagar, because of his state and philanthropic gesture, helped change the landscape of dairy industry in Brazil for good. He paid a visit in the early 1960s to Celso's farm in Sertanopolis, and before his death, he left all his cows to him. This not only deepened the friendship but also placed the start for huge progress in Brazilian livestock.</p>

<p>Legendary bull Krishna, which played such an important role in this process, left a legacy of his own. After his death, Cid embalmed Krishna's body in a glass coffin and preserved it in the farmhouse, where it remains even to this day. A sign on which someone heaved between Krishna's paws reads: "Want to meet Gir? Watch me!"-testament to the monumental influence of the bull on the breed.</p>

<p>Today, an excellent Brazilian Gir can produce as much as 20 litres of milk per day. Ten times more than the original cattle brought to Brazil nearly one century ago, this indicates a significant leap in productivity. But these leaps in productivity reflect the spectacular impact Krishna and following breeding programs made on the dairy sector and really improved many farmers' lives across Brazil.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The south Asian and Indian Ocean region is going through a "difficult time", Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe said on Thursday in an exclusive interview to NDTV. Sri Lanka will hold elections on September 21 to elect the next President.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The south Asian and Indian Ocean region is going through a "difficult time", Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe said on Thursday in an exclusive interview to NDTV. Sri Lanka will hold elections on September 21 to elect the next President.</p>

<p>Mr Wickremesinghe, who took over as President when Sri Lanka was going through its worst-ever economic crisis, has steered the economy back towards normalcy. His reelection will prove to be an effective referendum on an unpopular International Monetary Fund austerity plan enacted by his government after the island nation's unprecedented financial crisis.</p>

<p>Ranil Wickremesinghe, 75, is seeking a fresh mandate after claiming credit for stabilising the economy and bringing an end to months of food, fuel and medicine shortages.</p>

<p>In an exclusive interview to NDTV's Gaurie Dwivedi, Mr Wickremesinghe spoke not just about the domestic challenges Sri Lanka faces, but also the challenges faced by the entire south Asian region, where India plays a leading part.</p>

<h2><strong>CRISES IN MALDIVES AND BANGLADESH</strong></h2>

<p>"It is a difficult time for the region. Maldives is going through an economic crisis and needs all the help they can get. Bangladesh too is facing a political crisis and we (as neighbours) should ensure that stability returns as soon as possible, after which elections can be held where a new parliament can then decide on a new prime minister," the Sri Lankan President said, while speaking about the most recent and immediate regional challenges.</p>

<p>He went on to say that of all the others neighbours, "the issue of Bangladesh has the greatest impact on India", adding that Sri Lanka too has significant investments in Bangladesh, which it views as a "friendly country". He said he is concerned that if the crisis in Bangladesh is "not resolved in the short-to-medium term, it can have an impact on India."</p>

<h3><strong>SRI LANKA'S CHALLENGES AND ANTI-INDIA REMARKS</strong></h3>

<p>In 2022, when Ranil Wickremesinghe took charge as President, Sri Lanka was dealing with civil unrest spurred by the economic crisis. There were protests across the nation which led to thousands storming the Presidential palace which was then occupied by Mr Wickremesinghe's predecessor Gotabaya Rajapaksa, who fled the country. Mr Wickremesinghe took charge and restored calm and helped revived the economy by taking some tough decisions.</p>

<p>"Think of the time when all hope was lost... we didn't have food, gas, medicine, or any hopes. Now you have a choice. Decide if you want to go back to that period of terror, or progress," Mr Wickremesinghe had said in the closing days of his election campaign. India had stood by Sri Lanka during the crisis and helped revive its economy.</p>

<p>Mr Wickremesinghe told NDTV that it will be his priority to deepen economic ties, especially in infrastructure projects, adding that the two nations have shared cultural and economic ties for "thousands of years".</p>

<p>His rivals in the elections however have made some strong anti-India remarks, and should they win the election, it may prove to be a challenge for New Delhi and perhaps even a complete reset in ties.</p>

<p>"Let us first watch the elections," said the Sri Lankan President, hinting at his rivals' remarks being amplified due to political rhetoric. But he went on to say that "There will be some groups which will make anti-India remarks. That can't be stopped, but the aim is to minimise it."</p>

<p>"As far as India-Sri Lanka friendship is concerned, it is decided by the people of both nations and they have already decided it," he told NDTV.</p>

<p>Ranil Wickremesinghe faces two formidable challengers including Anura Kumara Dissanayaka, the leader of a once-marginal Marxist party tarnished by its violent past. The party led two failed uprisings in the 1970s and 1980s that left more than 80,000 people dead, and won less than four per cent of the vote in the last parliamentary elections.</p>

<p>But Sri Lanka's crisis has proven an opportunity for Mr Dissanayaka, who has seen a surge of support.</p>

<p>According to news agency AFP, fellow opposition leader Sajith Premadasa, once dismissed as the princeling dynast of a former president assassinated in 1993 during the country's decades-long civil war, is also favoured to make a strong showing. He has campaigned on a pledge to secure concessions from the IMF.</p>

<p>Speaking to NDTV about China, the Sri Lankan President said that "We've had good relations with China and we will continue to do so. But we will look at our interest first," adding that "We will ensure that nothing (about China ties) will affect the security of India. Our dealings with China will work within the framework" of India's national security.</p>

<h3><strong>GROWING CHINESE PRESENCE IN INDIAN OCEAN</strong></h3>

<p>Describing China as a "leading global power", Mr Wickremesinghe said that "China is going to have an extended influence in the Indian Ocean region. They are already working with a number of countries."</p>

<p>China is looking to grow its presence in the Indian Ocean and it is already working to build up its presence around the Suez Canal, said Mr Wickremesinghe, adding that China is looking to be a "leading global power after the United States."</p>

<p>"Sri Lanka will keep working with China, but we will work on our own terms, keeping India's interests in mind, after all India is just twenty miles away from us and we have shared historic ties" he told NDTV.</p>

<p>With an "all-weather ally" in Pakistan, a "pro-Beijing regime" in Maldives, an increasing presence in Nepal and deepening ties with Bangladesh's new regime, China has been mounting its presence across south Asia and the Indian Ocean. Sri Lanka votes on Saturday to elect their next President, one of the candidates reportedly being openly "pro-China and anti-India".<br />

<p>On receiving the award, the hotel's owner Jaisal Singh told NDTV, "It's a huge honour for us to receive this award. We are delighted and our teams are delighted. We worked very hard to bring Sujan to this level over the years. We believe in celebrating the best of India, of our culture, our wildlife and making a positive impact in the areas which we operate . We are very very happy that this is being celebrated and recognised now and has put us in the top fifty hotels in the world. We are very very happy."</p>

<p>Jaisal Singh, who started Sujan Jawai in 2013 along with his wife Anjali, said his vision for Sujan was to create a pioneering conservation tourism model that would benefit wildlife and local communities, not just an elegant and luxurious safari camp. Mr Singh, who himself is a passionate wildlife lover and photographer, added that the idea was to combine the best of Indian hospitality with a vision to protect India's wildlife.</p>

<p>Sujan Jawai, situated in the middle of the wilderness surrounded by a private forest, got its name from the seasonal Jawai river which flows through the landscape of where the hotel is located. The hotel offers luxurious stay in lavish tents and also provides experiences such as exploration of wildlife and rich biodiversity of the area accompanied by skilled naturalists, field guides and trackers. If you're a guest at Sujan Jawai, you can take excursions to the adjacent Jawai Leopard sanctuary and the Jawai Dam, which is home to several migratory birds and crocodiles.&nbsp;</p>

<p>What makes Sujan Jawai truly stand out is the sincere effort the group makes to promote sustainable tourism and support local communities in the area. The hotel's owners also run a property in Ranthambore. The proceeds from both properties go to helping local communities that in turn plays a critical role in preserving indigenous wildlife and natural habitats.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[A recent survey by Kaspersky highlights the careless work habits of UK commuters using public transport, revealing that many engage in risky activities like writing important emails and discussing confidential information aloud.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The careless work habits of commuters who use public transport risk huge data breaches, according to a new survey. The multinational cybersecurity and anti-virus provider firm, Kaspersky, recently conducted an investigation that brought shocking habits from UK commuters that may put work security at risk. As many as 2.2 million UK users travel to work by public transport, and most of them have some kind of activity that may unwittingly hit the mailboxes of their employees with malicious emails, putting organisations at the most critical privacy risk of leaks.</p>

<p>Citing the report by the cybersecurity firm <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://metro.co.uk/2024/09/17/guilty-making-this-career-ending-mistake-commute-21615791/"><em>The Metro News</em></a> reported that, 66 percent of commuters admitted to writing work emails while waiting for public transport; however, 29 percent state that they freely write very important documents, seemingly oblivious to what is going on around them. This poses a risk for sensitive information to end up in the wrong hands.</p>

<p>In addition, 35% reported that they had heard confidential business information over cell phone conversations on public transportation; 24% specifically named identifiable business names and work locations. To the ears of some cyberthief, it may all sound like a cherished platitude: "loose lips sink ships," because commuters unwittingly share valuable information with people sitting nearby-some of whom might just be cyberthieves.</p>

<p>Kaspersky advised travellers to be vigilant and guard themselves by concealing the most sensitive visual information, such as work badges, personal IDs, email signatures, and workplace locations, while travelling on public transport. As these risks of data breach cases are increasing day by day, an awareness about private life and security during daily commutes becomes a priority for everyone.</p>

<p>David Emm, Principal Security Researcher, Kaspersky explains: "Many of us are unwittingly leaving valuable personal breadcrumbs for others to follow during their daily travel to work, including business names, contact details and other sensitive information."</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Britain's Keir Starmer on Thursday faced mounting questions after analysis showed he has received more than £100,000 ($132,000) in gifts and hospitality since December 2019 -- more than any other lawmaker.</p>

<p>The revelations, even though the gifts have been declared and do not breach parliamentary rules, come at a time when his government is pushing Britons to accept short-term financial "pain for long-term good".</p>

<p>Most controversially, Labour is planning to cut winter fuel payments for millions of pensioners which will leave some £300 (nearly $400) worse off.</p>

<p>But widespread opposition to the move, including from within his own party, has been compounded by questions about gifts both he and his wife Victoria have received.</p>

<p>First came an admission from Starmer that Victoria, who recently attended a London Fashion Week show, accepted clothes worth £5,000 from Labour donor Waheed Alli, a media entrepreneur and member of the House of Lords.</p>

<p>Alli has also donated tens of thousands of pounds worth of clothing, accommodation and "multiple pairs" of spectacles to the prime minister himself.</p>

<p>Media have dubbed the row "passes for glasses" after it was disclosed that Alli had a temporary Downing Street security pass despite not having a government role.</p>

<p>Also this week, it emerged that Starmer's powerful chief of staff Sue Gray, who as a senior civil servant led an inquiry into Covid lockdown-breaking parties by the Tories at Downing Street, now earns £170,000 a year.</p>

<p>Starmer, who became Labour leader in early 2020, earns about £167,000.</p>

<h3><br />
<strong>Football</strong></h3>

<p>The drip-drip of details about gifts and high pay has fuelled accusations of hypocrisy from the opposition Conservative party at a time when the government is asking ordinary people to tighten their belts.</p>

<p>Since December 2019, Starmer has received £170,000 in gifts, benefits, and hospitality, according to an analysis of declared gifts by broadcaster Sky News and the Tortoise Media news website.</p>

<p>Included among £40,000 worth of hospitality were Taylor Swift tickets worth £4,000 and Premier League football tickets worth £12,000.</p>

<p>Starmer, a keen Arsenal fan, defended accepting the gifts this week, saying he could not go to football matches and watch from the stands for security reasons.</p>

<p>According to ITV News, Starmer has been given the use of a corporate box by Arsenal, which would normally cost £8,750 per game.</p>

<p>"If I don't accept a gift of hospitality, I can't go to a game," Starmer told reporters.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"You could say, 'well, bad luck'.... But, you know, never going to an Arsenal game again because I can't accept hospitality is pushing it a bit far."</p>

<p>Starmer has admitted the winter fuel payment cut is "unpopular" but insists "tough choices" are necessary to help close a £22 billion ($29 billion) "black hole" in the public finances that Labour claims they inherited from the Conservatives.</p>

<p>Last month he also warned that the government's Budget in late October -- Labour's first since it was last in power 14 years ago -- would be "painful".</p>

<p>The freebies have generated a string of negative headlines less than three months after Labour was elected with a thumping majority and on a promise to rebuild trust in politicians and public service.</p>

<p>The party's annual conference opens on Sunday.</p>

<p>"King of the Cadgers," read the Daily Star tabloid's front page headline on Thursday, using the British slang term for 'freeloaders', while even the Labour-supporting Daily Mirror was critical.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Vladislav Bakalchuk, the estranged husband of Russia's richest woman, was arrested and charged with murder on Thursday, his lawyers said, after a deadly shootout at the Moscow office of Russia's largest online retailer.</p>

<p>Two people were killed in a shooting on Wednesday just a few blocks away from the Kremlin at the Wildberries office, as a dispute over the company's future took a violent turn. Seven others were wounded, including police officers.</p>

<p>Vladislav and his wife Tatyana Bakalchuk, who filed for divorce in July, have been embroiled in a bitter and public tussle since Wildberries announced plans to merge with outdoor advertising firm Russ Group in June.</p>

<p>Tatyana founded Wildberries, Russia's answer to Amazon, in 2004, growing it from an online clothes reseller into a major marketplace for all kinds of goods.</p>

<p>Both parties blamed each other for Wednesday's shooting.</p>

<p>Vladislav said he had arrived for a pre-arranged meeting and that it was staff at the office who fired the first shots. Tatyana said Vladislav and his colleagues had tried to seize the office and that there was no meeting scheduled.</p>

<p>Vladislav's lawyers said he had been arrested and charged with murder and the attempted murder of a law enforcement officer, something they said was a "blatant and unprecedented violation" of their client's rights.</p>

<p>The business dispute is centred around the merger that formed RVB, a new company with Robert Mirzoyan as CEO, which reduced Tatyana's overall stake to around 65% in RVB from 99% in Wildberries.</p>

<p>Vladislav at the time said his wife was being "manipulated". Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov, who stepped in to support Vladislav, called the merger an "asset grab".</p>

<p>Tatyana has dismissed both of those allegations. The Kremlin said the merger had won President Vladimir Putin's backing but he would not interfere with its progress.</p>

<p>In a tearful video message posted on Telegram early on Thursday, Tatyana said: "Vladislav, what are you doing? How will you look into the eyes of your parents and our children? How could you bring the situation to such absurdity?"</p>

<p>The affair harks back to the 1990s, when deadly corporate turf battles were commonplace as huge swathes of property were redistributed after the fall of the Soviet Union.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pagers and walkie-talkies, considered outdated modes of communication, were weaponised for a one-of-its-kind attack in Lebanon, resulting in a series of explosions for two consecutive days, killing 32 and injuring over 3,000 across the country. More details are yet to emerge on the walkie-talkie blasts.</p>

<p>The victims were mostly members of Hezbollah, a political party with a paramilitary that has a stake in Lebanese political affairs and is the arch-nemesis of Israel. It was expected that Mossad -an Israeli spy agency - would be blamed for the coordinated strikes. Israel has not reacted to the explosions.</p>

<h2><strong>But, how did it happen?</strong></h2>

<p>The <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/18/world/middleeast/israel-exploding-pagers-hezbollah.html" rel="no follow, no index">New York Times</a> spoke to three Israeli intelligence officers who said BAC Consulting, a Hungary-based manufacturer of pagers, was a shell company set up by Mossad to rig the devices at the source before shipping them to Lebanon. The report claims that BAC Consulting was under a contract to produce the devices on behalf of Gold Apollo, the Taiwanese company whose pagers exploded and killed nine on Tuesday. The report added that at least two other shell companies were created as well to mask the real identities of the people creating the pagers.</p>

<p>BAC did not take ordinary clients and Hezbollah mattered to them. The batteries were laced with explosive Pentaerythritol Tetranitrate (PETN), a very powerful explosive material. Reuters reported that <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/3-grams-of-explosives-per-pager-israel-complex-op-to-hurt-hezbollah-6590229">three grams</a> of explosives were hidden in the new pagers and had gone "undetected" by Hezbollah for months. On Tuesday, the Hezbollah members received a message on their page, thinking it was from their commander but it triggered explosions across the country.</p>

<h2><b>"Bury It Or Put It In A Box"</b></h2>

<p>The Israelis began targeting Hezbollah operatives through cyberattacks by hacking devices, remotely controlling cameras of phones and monitoring the activities of the enemy.</p>

<p>In February, Hezbollah Chief, Hassan Nasrallah, concluded that the agent tracking is their phones and it's important to switch to low-tech when Israel moved to sophisticated technology for targeting. The urgency came after 170 fighters had already been killed in targeted Israeli strikes on Lebanon, including one senior commander and a top Hamas official in Beirut.</p>

<p>He warned them and said, "Bury it or put it in an iron box and lock it." The company had been supplying pagers to Lebanon but on a low scale. The purported Israeli plot was in the making for over a year and Nasrallah's request to fellow Hezbollah members was the last nail in the coffin.</p>

<p>Israel holds the capability to strike deep into the enemy's infrastructure. In 2021, Israel used automated AI-assisted weapons to assassinate Iranian scientist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh on the outskirts of Tehran.</p>

<p>Today, the Hezbollah chief said Israel's attack on communication devices has "crossed all red lines and has come as an unprecedented blow to the group." Meanwhile, Lebanese state media reported that Israeli warplanes broke the sound barrier over Beirut i.e. they went supersonic.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Spotlight On 'Unit 8200'</strong></h2>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/unit-8200-israels-secret-intelligence-arm-linked-to-hezbollah-pager-attacks-6599223">Reuters reported</a> that Unit 8200 played a role in the development stage of the operation. The report said that the unit was responsible for testing how to insert explosive material within the manufacturing process.</p>

<p>Unit 8200, also known as Cyber spies, is a highly specialised military group that develops and operates intelligence-gathering tools, comparable to the US National Security Agency.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Unit 8200 develops and operates advanced surveillance tools and cyber defence systems and is credited with high-profile operations. It played a key role in the Stuxnet virus attack from 2005 to 2010, which damaged Iranian nuclear centrifuges. In 2017, it was allegedly behind a cyberattack on Lebanon's state telecom company, Ogero, disrupting communications. The unit also contributed to thwarting an ISIS plot in 2018, helping to prevent a planned attack on a civilian airliner travelling from Australia to the UAE.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Dismissing a report by news agency Reuters claiming that ammunition sold by Indian manufacturers has been diverted to Ukraine by European customers, the Ministry of External Affairs has termed it "inaccurate and mischievous".]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dismissing a report by news agency Reuters claiming that ammunition sold by Indian manufacturers has been diverted to Ukraine by European customers and New Delhi did not stop the trade, the Ministry of External Affairs has termed it "inaccurate and mischievous".&nbsp;</p>

<p>Answering questions on the report, MEA Spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said on Thursday, "We have seen the Reuters report. It is speculative and misleading. It implies violations by India, where none exist and, hence, is inaccurate and mischievous.</p>

<p>Emphasising that India has an impeccable track record of compliance with international obligations on the export of military and dual-use items, Mr Jaiswal added, "India has been carrying out its defence exports taking into account its international obligations on non-proliferation and based on its own robust legal and regulatory framework, which includes a holistic assessment of relevant criteria, including end-user obligations and certifications."</p>

<p>In its report, Reuters cited conversations with eleven Indian and European government and defence industry officials and an analysis of commercially available customs data to claim that artillery shells sold by Indian arms manufacturers had been diverted to Ukraine by European customers and the Indian government did not intervene to stop the trade despite protests from Moscow.</p>

<p>The report said the supply of munitions, which have helped Ukraine in the war against Russia, had been happening for over a year and the Kremlin had raised the issue with India at least twice, including in July, during a meeting between Foreign Minister S Jaishankar and his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It said Indian arms export regulations specify that weaponry can be used only by the declared purchaser and future sales to them can be stopped if there are unauthorised transfers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Two Indian government and two defence industry sources told Reuters that Delhi produced only a very small amount of the ammunition being used by Ukraine, with one official estimating that it was under 1% of the total arms imported by Kyiv since the war. The news agency couldn't determine if the munitions were resold or donated to Kyiv by the European customers," the report said.</p>

<p>"Among the European countries sending Indian munitions to Ukraine are Italy and the Czech Republic, which is leading an initiative to supply Kyiv with artillery shells from outside the European Union, according to a Spanish and a senior Indian official, as well as a former top executive at Yantra India, a state-owned company whose munitions are being used by Ukraine," it added.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Half a century of advancements in biomedical science paved the way for today's powerful weight-loss drugs like Ozempic -- so what was that journey like for the scientists involved?</p>

<p>Joel Habener of Massachusetts General Hospital and Svetlana Mojsov of The Rockefeller University, who are being honored with the prestigious Lasker Award for their role in the research, spoke to AFP about how they made the discoveries that changed the way we think about weight.</p>

<p>The pair will share the award -- often considered a predictor of future Nobel success -- as well as an honorarium of $250,000 with Lotte Bjerre Knudsen of Novo Nordisk, which manufactures Ozempic.</p>

<p><strong>Early molecular biology</strong></p>

<p>Obesity has escalated into a global health crisis, affecting 900 million people worldwide -- including over 40 percent of Americans and nearly a quarter of Europeans.</p>

<p>But back in the mid-1970s, when Habener, now 87, began his career as a physician-scientist, his curiosity was focused on diabetes.</p>

<p>He was particularly interested in the pancreatic hormone glucagon, known for raising blood sugar levels -- the opposite effect of insulin, which was already used as a treatment for diabetes.</p>

<p>By understanding and potentially modulating glucagon's effects, Habener believed he could uncover new ways to manage diabetes.</p>

<p>To pursue this, he turned to the emerging field of molecular biology, aiming to isolate and clone the gene that encodes glucagon.</p>

<p><strong>Fortuitous turn to fish</strong></p>

<p>But he quickly hit a roadblock: the US National Institutes of Health had just banned the type of research he planned to conduct on mammalian genes.</p>

<p>This pushed him to pivot to studying the anglerfish, a creature with a unique endocrine organ outside the pancreas.</p>

<p>"It turned out to be a godsend in terms of simplicity," he recalled, describing the eureka moment when he isolated a precursor protein that gave rise to glucagon -- as well as a second hormone that resembled glucagon.</p>

<p>Though Habener didn't realize its significance at the time, this turned out to be the fish-equivalent of "GLP-1," the foundation for today's diabetes and obesity drugs.</p>

<p>"That's what's beautiful about discovery research," he said. "By exploring the unknown, you get surprises."</p>

<p><strong>Identifying GLP-1's potential</strong></p>

<p>Mojsov, who emigrated from Yugoslavia, took the early discoveries made by Habener and others further with several important contributions.</p>

<p>Poring over the hormone's structure, she correctly predicted the active form of GLP-1 and devised innovative chemistry methods to synthesize it.</p>

<p>She also proposed that GLP-1 would be released in the intestines and act to trigger insulin production. Together with Habener and others, she proved this theory through lab experiments and human trials, identifying its therapeutic potential.</p>

<p>"I was sure it would be a good drug for diabetes," said the 76-year-old. However, at the time, there was no scientific evidence that hormones could regulate weight.</p>

<p>It was only later studies by Habener, Mojsov, and others that revealed GLP-1's ability to slow stomach emptying and its interaction with receptors in the brain, helping to curb appetite and possibly even address substance addictions.</p>

<p><strong>New era of treatments</strong></p>

<p>Starting in the 1990s, Knudsen, the head of GLP-1 therapeutics at Novo Nordisk, and her team built on these breakthroughs to develop treatments for diabetes (Ozempic) and obesity (Wegovy), extending the drug's therapeutic effects from just a few hours to over a week.</p>

<p>"Now we can see that GLP-1 actually has a much broader spectrum of health benefits," said Mojsov, though she laughs off the "miracle drug" label.</p>

<p>Obese patients "lose a lot of weight but also their muscle mass, and that's also very serious," she stressed. "I think it should never be taken for cosmetic reasons."</p>

<p>GLP-1 drugs have now been approved for treating cardiovascular disease, and emerging evidence suggests they may offer protective effects against dementia.</p>

<p>Though the exact mechanism remains unclear, Habener suggests their ability to suppress inflammatory pathways might be the common link.</p>

<p>As for the future, Mojsov is optimistic. She foresees a new generation of similar drugs that will further minimize side effects and target an even broader range of diseases.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p>

<p>As Australia and other countries debate the merits of banning kids under 14 from social media, Meta has announced a significant "reimagining" of teenagers' experience of Instagram.</p>

<p>These new "Teen Accounts" will be set to private by default, have the maximum content and messaging restrictions possible, pause notifications at night, and add new ways for teens to indicate their content preferences.</p>

<p>Importantly, for kids under the age of 16, changing these default settings will now require parental permission.</p>

<p>The move, touted as giving "peace of mind" for parents, is a welcome step - but parents and guardians should use it to talk to their kids about online spaces.</p>

<p>What's different about Teen Accounts? Teen Accounts are a combination of new features and a repackaging of a number of tools that have already been in place, but haven't had the visibility or uptake Meta would have preferred.</p>

<p>Bringing these incremental changes together under the umbrella of Teen Accounts should make these changes more visible to teens and caregivers.</p>

<p>Among the the main features: 1. under-18s will have accounts set to private by default, and under-16s will only be able to change that setting with parental permission 2. teens will only be able to receive messages from people they are already following or are connected to 3. content restrictions and the blocking of offensive words in comments and messages will be set to the maximum setting possible 4. notifications from Instagram will be turned off between 10pm and 7am 5. teens will be reminded to leave Instagram after 60 minutes of use on any given day.</p>

<p>Some of these tools are more useful than others. A reminder to leave Instagram after 60 minutes that teens can just click past sets a fairly low bar in terms of time management.</p>

<p>But default account settings matter. They can really shape a user's experience of a platform. Teens having private accounts by default, with protections around content and messaging set to their strongest settings, will significantly shape their time on Instagram.</p>

<p>Stopping under-16s from changing these settings without parental or guardian consent is the biggest change, and really does differentiate the teen experience of Instagram from the adult one.</p>

<p>Most of these changes focus on safety and age-appropriate experiences. But it is a positive step for Meta to also include new ways for teens to indicate the content they actually prefer, instead of just relying on algorithms to infer these preferences.</p>

<p>Do parents and guardians have to do anything? In promoting Teen Accounts, head of Instagram Adam Mosseri emphasised the change is aimed at giving parents "peace of mind". It doesn't require explicit intervention from parents for these changes to occur.</p>

<p>"I'm a dad, and this is a significant change to Instagram and one that I'm personally very proud of," noted Mosseri. This is part of a longer-term strategy of positioning Mosseri as a prominent parental voice to increase his perceived credibility in this domain.</p>

<p>Parents or guardians will need to use their own accounts for "supervision" if they want to know what teens are doing on Instagram, or have access to more granular controls. These include setting personalised time limits, seeing an overview of a teen's activity, or allowing any of the default settings to change.</p>

<p>The real opportunity for parents here is to take these changes as a chance to discuss with their children how they're using Instagram and other social media platforms.</p>

<p>No matter what safety measures are in place, it's vital for parents to build and maintain a sense of openness and trust so young people can turn to them with questions, and share difficulties and challenges they encounter online.</p>

<p>Meta has said the shift to Teen Accounts will reduce the level of inappropriate content teens might encounter, but that can never be absolute.</p>

<p>These changes minimise the risks, but don't remove them. Ensuring young people have someone to turn to if they see, hear, or experience something that's inappropriate or makes them uncomfortable will always be incredibly important. That's real peace of mind.</p>

<p>Can't teens still lie about their age? Initially, Teen Accounts will apply to new teens who sign up. The changes will also roll out for existing teen users whose birth date Instagram already has on file.</p>

<p>Over time, Mosseri and Antigone Davis, Meta's global head of safety, have both said Instagram is rolling out new tools that will identify teenagers using Instagram even if they didn't enter an accurate birth date. These tools are not active yet, but are supposed to be coming next year.</p>

<p>This is a welcome change if it proves accurate. However, the effectiveness of inferring or estimating age is yet to be proven.</p>

<p>The bigger picture Teen Accounts are launching in Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States this week, taking up to 60 days to reach all users in those countries. Users in the rest of the world are scheduled to get Teen Accounts in January 2025.</p>

<p>For a long time, Instagram hasn't done enough to look after the interests of younger users. Child rights advocates have mostly endorsed Teen Accounts as a significant positive change in young people's experiences and safety on Instagram.</p>

<p>Yet it is uncertain whether Meta has done enough to address the push in Australia and elsewhere to ban young people (whether under-14s or under-16s, depending on the proposal) from all social media.</p>

<p>Teen Accounts are clearly a meaningful step in the right direction, but it's worth remembering it took Instagram 14 years to get to this point. That's too long.</p>

<p>Ultimately, these changes should serve as a prompt for any platform open to kids or teens to ensure they provide age-appropriate experiences. Young users can gain a lot from being online, but we must minimise the risks.</p>

<p>In the meantime, if these changes open the door for parents and guardians to talk to young people about their experiences online, that's a win.

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US airline Delta apologized on Thursday after a recent flight had to make an emergency landing due to a cabin pressure problem, with local media reporting the incident caused passengers to bleed from the nose and ears.</p>

<p>The US Federal Aviation Administration said it was investigating the September 15 incident on a flight from Salt Lake City in the southwestern state of Utah to Portland, Oregon in the Pacific Northwest.</p>

<p>Delta said in a statement emailed to AFP that the aircraft, carrying 140 passengers, "was unable to pressurize above 10,000 feet".</p>

<p>After the plane landed, 10 people were checked or treated by medical personnel who met the flight at the gate, it added.</p>

<p>"We sincerely apologize to our customers for their experience on flight 1203 on Sept. 15," the statement said.</p>

<p>"The flight crew followed procedures to return to SLC where our teams on the ground supported our customers with their immediate needs."</p>

<p>Local station KSL TV interviewed passengers who described seeing people gripping their heads in pain or bleeding from their ears or noses not long after the plane took off.</p>

<p>Passenger Jaci Purser told KSL TV she felt a stabbing pain in her ear.</p>

<p>"I grabbed my ear, and I pulled my hand back, and there was blood on it," she said.</p>

<p>Delta said the plane's oxygen masks did not deploy.</p>

<p>The Boeing 737-900 aircraft was repaired and was back in service the day after the incident, Delta said.</p>

<p>The plane is not part of the Boeing 737 MAX fleet, which brought renewed scrutiny to the embattled aviation giant in January when a fuselage panel blew out of an Alaska Airlines plane mid-flight, necessitating an emergency landing.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Officials at NASA confirmed today that a 120-foot asteroid, roughly the size of a small aeroplane, will make a close approach to Earth. But do not worry, as despite close proximity, the asteroid 2022 SW3 poses no threat. NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory assured there was no cause for concern when it said that the asteroid "is going to come no closer than about 1.6 million miles."</p>

<p>It will pass within the distance of three times that of Earth to the Moon. Although close, the scientists are swift to say that it does not threaten Earth yet. This close encounter will be an opportunity for scientists to acquire much-needed data about near-earth objects (NEOs).</p>

<p>The scientists track the orbits of the known asteroids, including <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/asteroid-watch/next-five-approaches/">2022 SW3</a>, which periodically come close to the Earth orbit. These observations are very important for the purpose of prediction and assessing danger.</p>

<p>Indeed, asteroids were part of the material leftovers of the old solar system, born about 4.6 billion years ago. They don't have atmospheres and are not shaped as planets. High technology and observation can trace their paths to the smallest detail.</p>

<p>A few had major implications for Earth, including the one at Chicxulub that caused the demise of the dinosaurs 66 million years ago.</p>

<p>Examples include NASA's OSIRIS-REx and Japan's Hayabusa2. Samples obtained from missions like these have been instrumental in giving answers about the origin of our solar system and how life-preserving compounds could have landed on Earth. Every asteroid that passes adds to our chances of getting ready for other potential threats.</p>

<p>Today's close flyby also becomes an eye-opener to the fact that one cannot just understand asteroids or close observations of them once and for all. Though this event is not hazardous, it will be a good time to collect data in preparation for upcoming encounters by scientists.</p>

<p>The space agency NASA has created a defence system to ward off the fear of these near-earth objects. <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/nasas-dart-mission-hits-asteroid-in-first-ever-planetary-defense-test/">According to NASA</a>, the Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART), the world's first planetary defence technology demonstration, successfully impacted its asteroid target in the past in an attempt to move an asteroid in space.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Anna Sorokin, who inspired Netflixs Inventing Anna, has made her debut on Dancing With The Stars, turning heads with an ankle monitor.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Anna Sorokin, also known as Anna Delvey, is back in the spotlight, this time for a surprising reason. The Russian-born con artist, whose elaborate scams once shocked the world, is now making headlines for her participation in a reality programme, <em>Dancing With The Stars</em>. Clad in a glittery ankle monitor, Sorokin's debut on the show has been nothing short of a spectacle.</p>

<h2><strong>Who is Anna Sorokin?</strong></h2>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/search?searchtext=anna-sorokin">Anna Sorokin</a>, 33, rose to infamy for masquerading as a wealthy German heiress named Anna Delvey. At her 2019 trial, Sorokin was convicted of defrauding hotels, banks, and other institutions of over $200,000 (around Rs 1.67 crore). She also extracted additional funds from associates and friends whom she deceived on various pretexts.</p>

<p>Sorokin's high-profile fraud led to many media stories and public fascination, culminating in the 2022 Netflix series<em>&nbsp;'Inventing Anna'.</em></p>

<h2><strong>Netflix's<em>&nbsp;'Inventing Anna'</em></strong></h2>

<p>Netflix series<em>&nbsp;'Inventing Anna'&nbsp;</em>delves into Sorokin's dramatic rise and fall through the eyes of Jessica Pressler, the journalist behind the viral 2018 expose. '<em>Inventing Anna'</em> dramatises Sorokin's life as a con artist and her manipulation of New York's elite. It delves into her elaborate schemes and the ensuing legal battles. It has received widespread attention for its portrayal of Sorokin's audacious lies and the ensuing fallout.</p>

<h2><strong>Convictions and legal struggles</strong></h2>

<p>In 2019, Sorokin was convicted of theft and grand larceny, sentenced to four to 12 years in prison, and ordered to pay restitution. After serving her sentence, she was released in February 2021 but soon faced immigration issues. She was detained by ICE for overstaying her visa and spent over a year in custody. In October 2022, a judge allowed her to transition to home confinement while she contested her deportation. Despite her legal troubles, Sorokin managed to negotiate terms that permitted her to travel from New York to Los Angeles for '<em>Dancing With The Stars</em>'.</p>

<h2><strong><em>'Dancing With The Stars'</em> appearance</strong></h2>

<p>Anna Sorokin's appearance during the premiere of '<em>Dancing With The Stars'</em> on September 17 has been marked by her distinctive ankle monitor, which has drawn significant attention.&nbsp;An ankle monitor is a device that is used to track someone's location and movement.</p>

<p>After the premiere, she was quoted as telling The Associated Press, "It's actually not a big issue at all. It's pretty light and I asked them to make it tight so it doesn't dangle. So, it's not so bad."</p>

<p>But despite describing the monitor as light, its presence has become a focal point of her dance performances. Partnered with professional dancer, Ezra Sosa, Sorokin performed to Sabrina Carpenter's <em>Espresso</em> song. Sorokin admitted that her performance was not perfect but expressed relief and satisfaction with her experience. She hoped viewers would overlook her past and give her a chance to showcase her abilities.</p>

<h2><strong>Public and media reaction</strong></h2>

<p>Early reactions to Sorokin's appearance on '<em>Dancing With The Stars'</em> have been mixed. Some even called her performance lacklustre, with the phrase ‘Anna Delvey's Lackluster DWTS Debut' trending on social media. Despite this, Sorokin remains hopeful about her public image and her efforts to rebuild her life after serving her sentence and fulfilling her restitution obligations.</p>

<p>“Hopefully people will give me, will give me a chance to show what I can do. And I served my time and I repaid my restitution,” she was quoted as saying.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who will be on a visit to the United States from September 21 to September 23 has a packed schedule. From the Quad Summit and UN General Assembly session, to holding multiple bilateral and courtesy meetings. He is also scheduled to meet top CEOs and business leaders and will also address the Indian community at a diaspora event in New York.</p>

<p>Ahead of the Prime Minister's visit, former US President and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said he will be meeting PM Modi during his visit. The US goes to polls on November 5 and Mr Trump is currently campaigning across the United States.</p>

<p>Though Mr Trump has claimed that there will be a meeting between the two leaders, the Ministry of External Affairs today did not announce it as part of the Prime Minister's itinerary.</p>

<p>When asked if PM Modi and Donald Trump will meet, the foreign ministry spokesperson said, "Many meetings are being fixed and the process is ongoing. At this moment we can't confirm any specific meet. We are looking at it from various angles. If and When meetings are fixed and confirmed with any leader, we will update you all."</p>

<p>While campaigning in Michigan on Tuesday, Donald Trump said he would meet PM Modi during his visit to the United States at the end of this week. He described Prime Minister Modi as "A fantastic man".</p>

<p>"He (PM Modi) happens to be coming to meet me next week, and (Prime Minister) Modi, he's fantastic. I mean, fantastic man. A lot of these leaders are fantastic," Donald Trump said.</p>

<p>Speaking about Indians, Mr Trump said, "These people are the sharpest people," but India imposes heavy tariffs on imports, "they are a very big abuser of tariffs."</p>

<p>"They're not a little bit backwards...You know the expression, they're at the top of their game, and they use it against us. India is very tough. Brazil is very tough, China is the toughest of all, but we were taking care of China with the tariffs," he said.</p>

<p>The United States is going to polls on November 5 and postal voting has begun in several states. Donald Trump, who is the Republican candidate and is seeking a second term in the White House, is up against Democrat candidate Kamala Harris, who is seeking her first term as President. Ms Harris is the current Vice President of the United States.</p>

<p>The most recent electoral polls suggest that Kamala Harris, who is of Indian heritage, is leading Donald Trump.</p>

<p>A new poll released today shows Kamala Harris with significant leads over Donald Trump in swing-states Pennsylvania and Michigan, two "blue wall" battlegrounds seen as key to winning the White House in November.</p>

<p>In the most latest poll of likely voters, Kamala Harris is leading Donald Trump 51 per cent to 45 per cent in Pennsylvania, and tops him 50-45 per cent in Michigan, two states in the post-industrial Rust Belt in the American Midwest and Northeast.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Greece has witnessed a remarkable 37 per cent surge in property purchases by Indian investors between July and August. This flurry of activity is driven by Indian buyers eager to secure permanent residency under Greece's Golden Visa Programme before significant regulatory changes took effect on September 1.</p>

<p>Launched in 2013, Greece's Golden Visa programme offers residency permits in exchange for property investments, making it an attractive option for non-EU citizens. Its initial €250,000 (Rs 2.2 crore) threshold was one of Europe's lowest, drawing significant investment and boosting Greece's real estate market.</p>

<p>However, the surge in demand pushed up property prices, particularly in high-demand areas like Athens, Thessaloniki, Mykonos and Santorini. To address this, the Greek government raised the investment threshold to €800,000 (approx Rs 7 crore) for properties in these regions, effective September 1 2024.</p>

<p>Sanjay Sachdev, Global Marketing Director of Leptos Estates, noted an "unprecedented rush" of Indian homebuyers in recent months. "Many investors purchased under-construction projects with handover periods of six-twelve months," said Sanjay Sachdev, as per <a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/real-estate/wealthy-indians-investing-in-uae-european-realty-for-lifestyle-returns-12398091.html">MoneyControl</a>.</p>

<p>Many invested in properties under construction, with completion timelines of six to twelve months. Leptos Estates reported selling out its available residential stock in Greece due to this surge.<br />
<br />
<strong>Effective September 2024, the revised Golden Visa programme seeks to:</strong><br />
<br />
- Temper rapid price increases<br />
<br />
- Promote equitable development<br />
<br />
- Direct investment towards less saturated areas<br />
<br />
<strong>The appeal of Greece's Golden Visa Programme for Indian investors</strong></p>

<p>- Greece offers attractive rental yields of 3-5 per cent annually, making property investments financially rewarding.</p>

<p>- Property values in Greece have been increasing at an impressive rate of 10 per cent year-on-year, with significant growth following the pandemic.</p>

<p>- Investors gain access to high-quality healthcare, education, and the opportunity to establish businesses within the EU.</p>

<p>Before the rule changes, Indian investors gravitated towards popular Greek islands like Paros, Crete, and Santorini for property purchases.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A US court's summons to the Indian government over Khalistani terrorist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun's civil suit, alleging a plot to murder him, was "completely unwarranted", the Ministry of External Affairs has said. In a news briefing this afternoon, Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri was asked about the summons by the US District Court for Southern District of New York.</p>

<p>The summons names Government of India, National Security Advisor Ajit Doval, former R&amp;AW chief Samant Goel, R&amp;AW agent Vikram Yadav, and Indian businessman Nikhil Gupta and seeks a reply within 21 days.</p>

<p>"When these issues were first brought to our attention, we took action. There's a high-level committee engaged (in this matter)," the Foreign Secretary said.&nbsp;He said this was a "completely unwarranted case". "I invite your attention to the person who filed this," Mr Misri said, adding that&nbsp;Pannun's "antecedent is well-known" and that he is from an unlawful organisation. Pannun heads the radical Sikhs for Justice and is known to put out incendiary speeches and threats against Indian leaders and institutions. New Delhi designated him a terrorist in 2020.</p>

<p>In November, the UK newspaper Financial Times reported that the US had thwarted a plot to kill Pannun, who holds dual citizenship in the US and Canada. Officials in the Joe Biden administration later confirmed this.</p>

<p>In its first response, the External Affairs Ministry said it is a "matter of concern" and stressed that India has launched a high-level probe.</p>

<p>"As regards the case against an individual that has been filed in a US court, allegedly linking him to an Indian official, this is a matter of concern. We have said that this is also contrary to government policy," then MEA spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said.</p>

<p>In May this year, External Affairs Minister Dr S Jaishankar said India is investigating the matter, but stressed that it would not impact the "upward trajectory" of India-US ties.</p>

<p>"The United States brought to our attention certain information in good faith because we also believe some of it has implications for our own system," he said in an interview to news agency PTI.</p>

<p>"We are investigating it. But I do not think the fundamental course of the upward trajectory of India-US is impacted by this at all," he said.</p>

<p>US Ambassador to India Eric Garcetti has told NDTV that this matter will not affect India-US ties.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[The study showed that coupled with air pollution, high temperatures as well as metabolic disorders, fuelled a significant rise in global cases and deaths due to stroke in the last three decades.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For the first time, a study on Thursday showed that ambient particulate matter air pollution is a top risk factor for subarachnoid haemorrhage -- a type of brain stroke -- at par with smoking. The study, led by an international team of researchers from India, the US, New Zealand, Brazil, and UAE showed that air pollution contributed to 14 per cent of the death and disability caused by this serious stroke subtype.</p>

<p>The study showed that coupled with air pollution, high temperatures as well as metabolic disorders, fuelled a significant rise in global cases and deaths due to stroke in the last three decades.</p>

<p>The number of people worldwide having a new stroke rose to 11.9 million in 2021 -- up by 70 per cent since 1990. Stroke-related deaths rose to 7.3 million -- up by 44 per cent since 1990.</p>

<p>The study identified 23 modifiable risk factors responsible for 84 per cent of the stroke burden in 2021.</p>

<p>In 2021, the five leading global risk factors for stroke were high systolic blood pressure, particulate matter air pollution, smoking, high LDL cholesterol, and household air pollution, with considerable variation by age, sex, and location.</p>

<p>It also showed substantial progress made in reducing the global stroke burden by reducing particulate matter air pollution (20 per cent), and smoking (13 per cent).</p>

<p>"With 84 per cent of the stroke burden linked to 23 modifiable risk factors there are tremendous opportunities to alter the trajectory of stroke risk for the next generation. Given that ambient air pollution is reciprocally linked with ambient temperature and climate change, the importance of urgent climate actions and measures to reduce air pollution cannot be overestimated," said co-author Dr Catherine O. Johnson, Lead Research Scientist at the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME).</p>

<p>While stroke is now the third leading cause of death worldwide (after ischaemic heart disease and Covid-19), the condition is highly preventable and treatable.</p>

<p>The researchers called for identifying sustainable ways to work with communities to take action to prevent and control modifiable risk factors such as high blood sugar and a diet high in sugar-sweetened drinks. There is a critical need for interventions focused on obesity and metabolic syndromes, Johnson said.</p>

<p>They also called for measures such as clean air zones and public smoking bans, which have been successful.</p>

<p>The findings based on the Global Burden of Disease, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) showed that more than three-quarters of those affected by strokes live in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).</p>

<p>The study also found that worldwide, the overall amount of disability, illness, and early death -- a measurement known as disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) -- lost to stroke increased by 32 per cent between 1990 and 2021, rising from around 121.4 million years of healthy life lost in 1990 to 160.5 million years in 2021.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

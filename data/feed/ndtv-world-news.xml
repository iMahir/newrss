       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kamala Harris celebrates her 60th birthday on Sunday, but it's US election rival Donald Trump whose age is under scrutiny after a series of rambling speeches and a bizarre dance party.</p>

<p>Seeking to shift the polls in a desperately tight White House race, Harris has ramped up attacks on the mental fitness of the 78-year-old, who is the oldest presidential candidate in US history.</p>

<p>"Donald Trump is increasingly unstable," Democratic Vice President Harris said on Wednesday after Trump spent nearly 40 minutes on stage swaying to music at a town hall event.</p>

<p>Harris is unlikely to take time off the campaign trail for her birthday as she and Republican former president Trump hammer crucial battleground states that could decide the November 5 vote.</p>

<p>US presidential elections are a major test of stamina for any candidate -- but the 2024 race has been unusually focused on age.</p>

<p>Harris's remarkable ascent to the top of the Democratic ticket came after 81-year-old President Joe Biden was forced to throw in the towel after a disastrous debate performance against Trump.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Biden's replacement as nominee by a vice president two decades his junior provided a shot in the arm for the party's election hopes, as Harris chased down Trump in the polls.</p>

<p>Trump said as much shortly after Biden pulled out.</p>

<p>"She is younger," Trump told Fox News at the time. "I mean, she's 60 years old... I didn't realize she was 60. I thought she was a little younger. But she is 60."</p>

<p>But with the polls stagnant for weeks, Harris has played the age card more and more.</p>

<p>The Democrat released her own medical report on October 12, describing her as in "excellent health" and fit for the presidency, with the only minor health issue of note being seasonal allergies and hives.</p>

<p>She then repeatedly pushed Trump over his own refusal to do the same.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>'Sexism against older women'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>The billionaire has instead referred to a note issued by his former White House doctor last year and his campaign insists on his stamina.</p>

<p>Harris's campaign has increasingly insinuated that Trump is not up to a second term, citing the withholding of his medical history plus a series of cancelled television interviews and political events.</p>

<p>"What is Donald Trump trying to hide?" Harris said on X.</p>

<p>Her campaign has also highlighted Trump's increasingly dark and erratic stump speeches and interviews, including when he recently raised the possibility of using the US military against the "enemy from within."</p>

<p>Polls suggest it's a strong issue for Harris.</p>

<p>Pew Research Center polling showed the percentage of people who call Trump "mentally sharp" dropping from 58 per cent in July to 52 per cent in September.</p>

<p>And while 49 per cent of voters said Trump's age would hurt his candidacy, 46 per cent of voters said Harris's age would help hers.</p>

<p>But the balancing act is also a tough one in an election where the age of voters is also a key issue.</p>

<p>Harris commands solid support among younger voters but older voters who may find her attacks on Trump's age lean towards him -- in a recent CBS poll, voters aged 45-64 side with Trump over Harris 53 per cent to 46, while among voters aged 65 and over it grows to 57 per cent to 42 per cent.</p>

<p>Yet Harris too faces underlying prejudices about age, said Nancy Hirschmann, a professor of American social thought at the University of Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>"Her age does have an effect in one sense, in that, the sexism of America really is for sure on older women," Hirschmann told AFP.</p>

<p>Trump's running mate JD Vance found himself under scrutiny for comments from a few years back in which he called top Democrats "childless cat ladies" and appeared to agree with dismissive remarks about post-menopausal women.</p>

<p>Harris has two stepchildren from her marriage to "Second Gentleman" Doug Emhoff.</p>

<p>"There's an added layer of sexism against older women over 50," added Hirschmann.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>King Charles on Friday begins a six-day tour of Australia, the realm where he was briefly schooled, shared a famous seaside kiss, and had a close shave with a would-be assassin.</p>

<p>It will be his 17th visit since he first arrived as a shy teenager in 1966 -- and his first tour Down Under as king.</p>

<p>Here are five things you may not know about Charles' time in Australia.</p>

<p><strong>'Pommy' bashing</strong></p>

<p>Then-Prince Charles first visited Australia as a gawky 17-year-old, who was shipped away to the secluded alpine Timbertop school in regional Victoria.</p>

<p>A stark departure from his rigid education in Scotland, he would spend two terms chopping logs to make firewood and on gruelling hikes in the nearby woods.</p>

<p>"While I was here I had the Pommy bits bashed off me," he would later remark, also describing it as "by far the best part" of his education.</p>

<p>Media baron Rupert Murdoch is among the many well-heeled alumni to also study at Timbertop, while former British Prime Minister Boris Johnson worked there as an assistant.</p>

<p><strong>King of the surf</strong></p>

<p>Bachelor Charles stripped off and plunged into the surf during a royal tour that took him to Western Australia in 1979.</p>

<p>As the shirtless prince strode towards the shore, he was ambushed by a bikini-clad model who planted a kiss on his cheek.</p>

<p>The instantly iconic photo would help Charles shed his pretentious reputation, prompting some to speculate that it was staged by Buckingham Palace all along.</p>

<p>On an earlier tour, Charles would shun a wetsuit to surf at the world-famous Bondi Beach in Sydney.</p>

<p>"By gee, it's bloody cold," he said. "Reminds me of home."</p>

<p><strong>Mummy dearest</strong></p>

<p>During that same 1977 visit, Charles would grant a rare interview to music television show Countdown.</p>

<p>"I saw your mum in London," star interviewer Molly Meldrum would remark in a faux pas since immortalised in Australia's national film archive.</p>

<p>"Are you referring to Her Majesty the Queen?" came Charles's frosty reply.</p>

<p><strong>Doting on Diana</strong></p>

<p>Charles returned to Australia with wife Diana in 1983, drawing mobs of adoring fans eager to see the "people's princess" at landmarks like the Sydney Opera House.</p>

<p>On the couple's first royal tour together, Diana broke royal protocol by bringing baby William along.</p>

<p>Their dancefloor whirl at Sydney's Wentworth Hotel would inspire a touching scene in the hit show The Crown.</p>

<p><strong>Close shave</strong></p>

<p>Two bangs rang out as Charles rose to give a harbourside speech to a packed Sydney crowd in 1994.</p>

<p>As security wrestled the gunman to the ground, Charles was filmed somewhat nonchalantly fiddling with his cufflinks.</p>

<p>It would later emerge that the 23-year-old assailant was a human rights protester who had fired blank rounds in a mock assassination attempt staged to raise awareness for asylum seekers.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The US this week named n ex-Indian intelligence officer - once associated with the Research and Analysis Wing - as the shadowy central figure in a failed plot to kill Gurpatwant Pannun, a Khalistani terrorist.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United States this week named <a class="sp_lnk2" href="http://www.ndtv.com/topic/vikash-yadav" target="_blank">Vikash Yadav</a>, a former Indian intelligence officer once associated with the Research and Analysis Wing, or R&amp;AW - as the shadowy central figure in a failed plot to kill <a class="sp_lnk2" href="http://www.ndtv.com/topic/gurpatwant-singh-pannun" target="_blank">Gurpatwant Pannun</a>, a Khalistani terrorist and founder of the banned Sikhs For Justice.</p>

<p>Pannun is a resident of New York and holds dual American and Canadian citizenship.</p>

<p>Vikash Yadav, 39, - known so far only as 'CC-1' in the indictment filed in a New York court - is in India at this time, but US officials are expected to pursue his extradition in connection with an alleged murder-for-hire conspiracy involving a second Indian citizen - <a class="sp_lnk2" href="http://www.ndtv.com/topic/nikhil-gupta" target="_blank">Nikhil Gupta</a>.</p>

<p>Gupta, 53, was extradited from Czechia to the US in June.</p>

<p>Yadav and Gupta face charges of murder-for-hire, conspiracy to commit murder-for-hire, and conspiracy to commit money laundering, and could be jailed for 40 years if convicted.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/cc1-man-named-in-us-indictment-in-khalistani-terrorist-gurpatwant-singh-pannun-case-no-longer-government-employee-india-6810995" target="_blank">India has confirmed Yadav is an ex-employee</a> of its premier spy agency.</p>

<p>The third member of this alleged conspiracy was the 'hitman' - allegedly contacted by Gupta on instructions from Yadav - who turned out to be an undercover American federal agent.</p>

<h3><strong>Gurpatwant Pannun Murder Plot Latest</strong></h3>

<p>Yadav's identity was made public Thursday after the US Justice Department unsealed a second indictment - the first named Gupta - in the Pannun murder-for-hire plot.</p>

<p>Vikash Yadav remains "at large", the Justice Department said, accusing the two men of "conspiring to assassinate an American citizen of Indian origin on US soil".</p>

<p>India has said Yadav - who also claims to have served in the Central Reserve Police Force - is no longer a government employee, after which State Department Spokesperson Matthew Miller told reporters the prosecutors are "satisfied" with New Delhi's cooperation.</p>

<h3><strong>Vikash Yadav, Gurpatwant Pannun Murder-For-Hire Conspirator</strong></h3>

<p>US prosecutors believe Yadav recruited Gupta in May last year.</p>

<p>According to the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-announces-charges-against-indian-government-employee-connection-foiled" target="_blank">unsealed indictment</a> Vikash Yadav - "during times relevant (to these charges)" - was, in fact, was "employed by the Government of India's Cabinet Secretariat, which houses Indian's foreign intelligence service (i.e., RAW)".</p>

<p>The indictment has Yadav describing his position as a "senior field officer" responsible for "security management" and "intelligence". Apart from claiming to have served in the CRPF - which Delhi has not confirmed - Yadav also claimed to have been trained in "battle craft".</p>

<p>The document also includes a photograph of Mr Yadav in military attire.</p>

<p>It also includes a photo two people exchanging money - American dollars - in a car. The photo was reportedly taken in New York and shows, prosecutors claim, money being paid to the 'hitman' by an as yet unknown man acting on behalf of Nikhil Gupta and Vikash Yadav.</p>

<h3><strong>Gurpatwant Pannun Murder Conspiracy Details</strong></h3>

<p>The prosecution claims possession of communications between Yadav and Gupta, in which the former demands the latter plan and execute the killing of Gurpatwant Pannun. In return, Gupta was told criminal charges against him, filed in a Gujarat court, would be dropped.</p>

<p>As part of this murder-for-hire conspiracy the prosecution also claims Yadav and Gupta contacted the 'hitman' - the undercover federal agent - to carry out the hit for $100,000.</p>

<p>An advance of $15,000 was paid in June last year, days before Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to the United States and shortly before another Khalistani terrorist, Hardeep Singh Nijjar, 45, was shot dead outside a gurdwara in Canada's Vancouver.</p>

<p>Nijjar's killing is the subject of a Canadian federal investigation and became the source of a bitter diplomatic row between Ottawa and New Delhi after Canada Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's comment about "agents of the Indian government" being involved in the murder.</p>

<p>India denounced the claim - coming as Mr Trudeau's popularity tanks before a general election - as "absurd", "preposterous", and "malicious", and claimed vindication this week after the Canadian leader admitted he had no hard evidence to back his claim.</p>

<h3><strong>Gurpatwant Pannun Murder-For-Hire Plot</strong></h3>

<p>The attempted killing was to take place in June.</p>

<p>US officials believe Yadav provided Gupta with details about Pannun, including his New York address and daily schedule. This was passed on to the 'hitman'.</p>

<p>However, Gupta told the 'hitman' to not act during or immediately after Mr Modi's visit.</p>

<p>According to the indictment, the plan changed after Nijjar was shot dead on June 18 - two days before Prime Minister Modi's visit. The following day Gupta allegedly told the 'hitman' not to wait; US officials claim he said "Nijjar was also a target... we have so many...:</p>

<p>On June 20 he reportedly told the 'hitman' "it is a priority now".</p>

<h3><strong>The Nikhil Gupta Case</strong></h3>

<p>The storm broke in November last year after the US charged Gupta and Yadav; the latter was then referred to only as CC-1 amid uncertainty over links to the Indian government.</p>

<p>Gupta - in US custody now - claimed involvement with an international drug syndicate and weapons trafficking in his communications with Yadav, according to the indictment.</p>

<p>He was in Czechia at the time and was detained by authorities there till his extradition this year. While in Czech custody Gupta moved the Supreme Court in India - via a family member identified only as Mr X.</p>

<p>He claimed multiple violations of fundamental rights, including threats to himself and his family, and requested the Indian government to intervene.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court said the matter did not lie in its jurisdiction and directed Gupta to seek relief from courts in Prague, but also told the External Affairs Ministry to do what it could.</p>

<p>The court noted it could only intervene to ensure consular access and that this had already been supplied, according to the petitioner's own statement.</p>

<p>At present Gupta is being held at a detention centre in Brooklyn in New York.</p>

<p>Gupta's lawyers have argued he was caught in 'crossfire' between the two governments.</p>

<h3><strong>Indian Government On Pannun Murder Plot</strong></h3>

<p>As soon as charges were filed India responded, firmly distancing itself from any murder-for-hire bid to kill an American citizen on foreign soil. The External Affairs Ministry said Delhi "takes such inputs seriously... and relevant departments are already examining the issue".</p>

<p>In December Mr Modi made his first public statement, asserting that though the allegations were serious "a few incidents" could not derail ties between the two countries.</p>

<p>"If someone gives us any information, we will definitely look into it," the Prime Minister told the Financial Times, "If a citizen of ours has done anything, good or bad, we are ready to look into it. Our commitment is to the rule of law."</p>

<h3><strong>Pannun Civil Suit Summons</strong></h3>

<p>The Indian government has, however, reacted strongly to a 'summons' by a US court in connection with a civil suit filed by Pannun, in which he claims a plot to kill him.</p>

<p>Apart from Yadav, Gupta, and the Government of India, the US District Court for the Southern District of New York also named National Security Advisor Ajit Doval and former RAW chief Samant Goel. This was in September. A reply was sought within 21 days.</p>

<p>India slammed the 'summons' as "<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/completely-unwarranted-india-on-us-court-summons-over-khalistani-terrorist-6600977" target="_blank">completely unwarranted</a>".</p>

       <description><![CDATA[A recent report by PEN America revealed that over 10,000 books were banned in US public schools during the 2023-2024 academic year, a threefold increase from the previous year.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>During the 2023-2024 academic year, nearly 10,000 books were banned in US public schools-a threefold increase from the previous year, according to a recent report by PEN America, a nonprofit organisation dedicated to protecting free expression.</p>

<p>As new censorship laws are passed by Republican-led states, this study shows a sharp increase over the previous year. According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://pen.org/memo-on-school-book-bans-2023-2024-school-year/">PEN America's survey</a>, the number of book bans has almost tripled countrywide from 3,362 the year before.</p>

<p>The authors of the survey revealed that about 8,000 book bans were recorded in Florida and Iowa, largely because of state laws. Several school districts outside of Florida and Iowa also banned heightened numbers of books this school year, such as the Elkhorn Area School District in Wisconsin, which banned more than 300 titles for several months.</p>

<p>In part due to the targeting of sexual content, the stark increase includes books featuring romance, books about women's sexual experiences, and books about rape or sexual abuse, as well as continued attacks on books with LGBTQ+ characters or themes, or books about race or racism and featuring characters of colour, as per the report.</p>

<p>Hinting that the number of banned books could be much higher than expected, the organisation mentioned in <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://pen.org/memo-on-school-book-bans-2023-2024-school-year/">its report</a> that "our numbers are certainly an undercount, as stories of book bans often go unreported. These numbers also do not account for the many reports of soft censorship, including increased hesitancy in book selection, ideologically-driven restrictions of school book purchases, the removal of classroom collections, and the cancellations of author visits and book fairs."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The analysis suggests that exorbitant CEO pay, driven by their leverage over corporate boards rather than performance.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The salary of Chief Executive Officers significantly declined in 2023 despite a robust stock market, according to a recent report. CEO pay was still astoundingly high-290 times higher than the ordinary worker-despite this drop.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.epi.org/publication/ceo-pay-in-2023/">The Economic Policy Institute's study</a> revealed that in 2023, there was an almost 20% decline in the total compensation received by chief executives of publicly traded corporations. Experts are puzzled by this surprising trend because executive salary usually follows the performance of the stock market.</p>

<p><strong>Key Findings from the Economic Policy Institute Analysis</strong></p>

<ol>
	<li>From 1978-2023, top CEO compensation shot up 1,085%, compared with a 24% increase in a typical worker's compensation.</li>
	<li>In 2023, CEOs were paid 290 times as much as a typical worker-in contrast to 1965, when they were paid 21 times as much as a typical worker.</li>
	<li>That CEOs were paid nearly 10 times as much as the top 0.1% of U.S. wage earners in 2022 illustrates just how distorted CEO pay increases have become.</li>
	<li>CEO pay is linked strongly to the stock market-but in 2023, the stock market held fairly steady, while there was an uncharacteristic dip in CEO pay.</li>
</ol>

<p>In the past, CEO compensation packages have been strongly correlated with stock performance, with stock awards and options accounting for a sizable amount of their total income. Nevertheless, despite the robust economic conditions, the new research indicates that this association was broken in 2023.</p>

<p>In an eye-opening conclusion, the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.epi.org/publication/ceo-pay-in-2023/">EPI analysis </a>indicates that CEOs are getting paid more because of their leverage over corporate boards, not because of the skills or contributions they make to their firms. Exorbitant CEO pay has contributed to rising inequality in recent decades as it has likely pulled up the pay of other top earners-concentrating earnings at the top and leaving fewer gains for ordinary workers.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/how-israeli-military-tracked-and-killed-hamas-chief-yahya-sinwar-in-gaza-6814828">Yahya Sinwar</a>, the Hamas leader who orchestrated the October 2023 assault on Israel and eluded capture for more than a year, was killed by Israeli forces yesterday in southern Gaza. Sinwar, 61, had spent two decades in Israeli prisons before returning to Gaza and emerging as its top leader.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As one of the chief architects of the surprise October 7 attack on Israel, which killed over 1,200 Israelis and brought more than 250 hostages into Gaza, Sinwar was a prime Israeli target. Israel had placed a $400,000 bounty on information leading to his capture or death. Despite numerous Israeli airstrikes targeting Hamas leadership, Sinwar managed to survive underground for months in the maze of tunnels beneath Gaza.</p>

<p>Sinwar's death now leaves a power vacuum at the helm of Hamas, raising questions about who will step in to fill the void during this crucial phase of the Gaza war. Several high-ranking Hamas figures, all with long histories of militant operations and political manoeuvring, are potential successors.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Here's a look at the figures who may lead Hamas:</p>

<h3><strong>Mahmoud al-Zahar</strong></h3>

<p>Mahmoud al-Zahar, one of Hamas's founding members is a frontrunner to succeed Sinwar. Known for his hardline stance, even by Hamas's standards, al-Zahar was instrumental in shaping the group's ideological framework, which focuses on both militant resistance against Israel and Islamist governance in Gaza. Al-Zahar also played a crucial role in the group's rise to power following the 2006 Palestinian legislative election and served as its first foreign minister.</p>

<p>Despite surviving multiple Israeli assassination attempts - in 1992 and again in 2003 - al-Zahar remains a key figure in Hamas's political structure.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Mohammed Sinwar</strong></h3>

<p>Another potential successor is Yahya Sinwar's brother, Mohammed Sinwar. Like his brother, Mohammed has been a longtime leader within Hamas's military wing, and his rise to leadership could signal continuity in the group's strategies. According to reports, Mohammed shares Yahya's hardline approach, and US officials have expressed concern that his leadership would make peace negotiations even more challenging.</p>

<p>While Mohammed has kept a low profile, he has been a critical figure in the group's military operations, surviving multiple assassination attempts by Israel.</p>

<h3><strong>Mousa Abu Marzouk</strong></h3>

<p>Mousa Abu Marzouk, a senior member of Hamas's political bureau, is another possible contender. He helped establish Hamas after breaking away from the Palestinian Muslim Brotherhood in the late 1980s. Abu Marzouk was once the head of Hamas's political bureau and has long been involved in its organisational and financial operations, including support for militant activities.</p>

<p>Despite being jailed in the United States in the 1990s for involvement in terrorist activities, Abu Marzouk was deported to Jordan and has remained an influential figure within the group's political apparatus. Though he has spent much of his time in exile, his experience and ties to Hamas's core ideology make him a strong candidate to take over political leadership.</p>

<h3><strong>Mohammed Deif</strong></h3>

<p>Mohammed Deif, the elusive commander of Hamas's military wing, Izz al-Din al-Qassam Brigades, is often rumoured to be either dead or severely injured following Israeli airstrikes. However, reports as recent as August 2024 suggest he might still be alive. Deif, who is credited with masterminding many of Hamas's most sophisticated operations, including the October 7 attack, is seen as a "hardline" figure.</p>

<p>Deif's survival is shrouded in mystery, and should he resurface, his military credentials could make him a potent leader.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Khalil al-Hayya</strong></h3>

<p>Khalil al-Hayya is a prominent figure within Hamas's political bureau, currently based in Qatar, and has played a key role in cease-fire negotiations in previous conflicts. Al-Hayya's leadership could be seen as a pragmatic choice for the group, especially if Hamas seeks to negotiate an end to the current war in Gaza. His involvement in the 2014 cease-fire talks with Israel showcased his ability to engage in high-level negotiations, and his leadership may offer a more diplomatic route for Hamas.</p>

<p>Al-Hayya survived an Israeli airstrike in 2007 that killed members of his family. His political acumen, combined with his connections to international mediators, particularly in Doha, makes him a figure that both Israel and Hamas could work with in cease-fire talks.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Khaled Mashal</strong></h3>

<p>Khaled Mashal, who led Hamas for over a decade from 2006 until 2017, remains a respected figure within the group, though he has fallen out of favour with some key factions. During his leadership, Mashal oversaw some of Hamas's most significant military and political milestones. However, his public opposition to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad during the Syrian civil war strained relations with Iran, Hamas's major backer.</p>

<p>Now based in Qatar, Mashal may still have influence.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mars is one of Earth's nearest space neighbours, and the idea of finding extraterrestrial life there, only a short rocket journey away, has long attracted human curiosity. Such life has not been discovered. However, since NASA and other space agencies have started employing robotic technology to examine the Red Planet's surface and skies, pictures of odd formations and features have continued to excite scientists and space enthusiasts curiosity and inspire both fear and optimism.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/feature/bear-face-spotted-on-mars-as-nasa-observes-rock-formation-3728042"><strong>Also Read | "Bear Face" Spotted On Mars As NASA Observes Rock Formation</strong></a></p>

<p>From an open travel book to the face of a teddy bear, frozen mineral flowers, a mysterious doorway, and fossilised animal tracks, there are numerous intriguing objects on Mars that seem out of place on a barren, dusty planet, igniting human curiosity.</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.sciencealert.com/eerie-discovery-on-mars-looks-exactly-like-a-human-face"><em>Science Alert</em></a>, an image captured by the Perseverance rover in the course of its duties is one of the grisliest yet: it looks, for all the world, like a desiccated, decaying human head, severed from any body, just withering away under the harsh light of the Sun.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/multimedia/raw-images/ZR0_1282_0780746892_644EBY_N0600390ZCAM09338_1100LMJ">NASA's Mars Perseverance rover</a> acquired this image using its Right Mastcam-Z camera. Mastcam-Z is a pair of cameras located high on the rover's mast. This image was acquired on September 27, 2024 (Sol 1282) at the local mean solar time of 11:50:05.</p>

<p>It looks like a chunk of sedimentary sandstone, not unlike other rocks around it. Which isn't unusual for Mars, especially where water is once thought to have flowed, according to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.sciencealert.com/eerie-discovery-on-mars-looks-exactly-like-a-human-face"><em>Science Alert.</em></a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>"The mass murderer Yahya Sinwar, responsible for the massacre and atrocities of October 7, was eliminated... by IDF (Israeli military) soldiers," Foreign Minister Israel Katz said in a statement.</p>

<p>Later, IDF released a video message of his Spokesperson RAdm. Daniel Hagari, talking about the killing of Sinwar and Israel's operational goals in Gaza.</p>

<p>"Sinwar was responsible for the most brutal attack against Israel in our history. When terrorists from Gaza invaded Israel, massacred Israelis in their homes, raped our women, burned entire families alive, and took over 250 men, women, children, and babies hostage into Gaza. 101 hostages still remain in captivity in brutal conditions for the past year," he said.</p>

<p>Mr Hagari said that Sinwar tried to escape justice but he failed but the Israeli military did it.</p>

<p>Blaming him for waging war with Israel while hiding behind civilians in Gaza, Mr Hagari reiterated, “Our war is with Hamas, not with the people of Gaza and we mean it.”</p>

<p>“We are working to increase the amount of humanitarian aid including food, water and medicine that goes into Gaza, to the people of Gaza who are suffering because of Yahya Sinwar,” he said and expressed condolences to the families of those murdered or kidnapped because of Sinwar.</p>

<p>“We bow our heads and remember how brave soldiers who paid their ultimate sacrifice to defend the people of Israel,” he added.</p>

<p>IDF is committed to “not rest” until they bring home all hostages “by any means”.</p>

He had earlier called Sinwar's death an "important landmark in the decline of the evil rule of Hamas".</p>

<p>Netanyahu revealed that Hamas is currently holding 101 hostages in Gaza, comprising citizens from 23 different countries, including Israel.</p>

<p>"Hamas is holding 101 hostages in Gaza who are citizens of 23 countries, citizens of Israel, but citizens of many other countries. Israel is committed to doing everything in our power to bring all of them home. Israel will guarantee the safety of all those who return our hostages," he said.</p>

<p>The Israeli PM issued a stern warning to those holding Israeli hostages, vowing that Israel will relentlessly pursue and bring them to justice.</p>

<p>"But to those who would harm our hostages, I have another message - Israel will hunt you down and bring you to justice. But to those who would harm our hostages, I have another message - Israel will hunt you down and bring you to justice.

<p>Netanyahu in his message also highlighted the elimination of key Hezbollah leaders, including Hassan Nasrallah, and asserted that the reign of terror imposed by the Iranian regime on its own people and those in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, and Yemen will "come to an end."</p>

<p>"Nasrallah is gone, his deputy Mohsen is gone, Haniyeh is gone, Deif is gone, Sinwar is gone. The reign of terror that the Iranian regime has imposed on its own people and on the peoples of Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and Yemen, too will come to an end," Netanyahu said.</p>

<p>He added, "All those who seek a future of prosperity and peace in the Middle East should unite to build a better future. Together, we can push back the forces of darkness and create a future of light and hope for all of us."</p>

<p>Hamas launched a horrific terror attack on Israel on October 7, 2023. About 2,500 terrorists breached the border into Israel from the Gaza Strip, killing more than 1200 people, including citizens of more than 30 countries, and also took over 250 people as hostages.</p>

<p>In response, Israel launched a strong counter-offensive in the Gaza Strip, while vowing to "completely eliminate" Hamas.</p>

<p>However, the mounting civilian toll has raised global concerns over humanitarian situation in the Strip. United Nations and other big nations have repeatedly called for a ceasefire, return of hostages and increased assistance for the civilian population in Gaza.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In order to create new content and gain more views from their followers, social media influencers are going way too far in their daily activities, and this is occasionally hurting people's religious sentiments.</p>

<p>Recently, a Chilean gymnast and social media influencer, Maria del Mar 'Marimar' Perez Banus, has caused massive outrage in Japan for using a sacred symbol to create physical workout video. She recorded the video and also uploaded it to her accounts on the different social media platforms.</p>

<p>In the video, which she initially uploaded to her Instagram account and then deleted following the controversy-although it went viral on other social networks-the young woman can be seen using a Torii as a bar to do pull-ups.</p>

<p>Torii, although at first glance they appear to be simple structures, are a sacred gate or traditional arch that is usually placed at the entrance of Shinto shrines to mark the border between profane and sacred ground. The presence of a torii at the entrance is usually the simplest way to identify Shinto shrines.</p>

<p>Perez held onto the symbol and performed leg movements to the beat of DJ Casper's song 'Cha Cha Slide.'</p>

<p>The video has now been deleted from the couple's combined Instagram account; however, it has had over 40 million views after being shared on X/Twitter.</p>

<p>More than 3,000 comments slammed the tourists, calling them "vulgar and uneducated," "disrespectful," and "attention seekers." The former gymnasts apologised in a video posted on Tuesday (15 October) to their followers.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>China will prefer Kamala Harris to Donald Trump as the next US presidential considering that bilateral ties deteriorated sharply during the latter's presidency leading to serious confrontation, a senior member of the Chinese national advisory body said on Thursday.</p>

<p>The Chinese government prefers not to comment on the US presidential election because it doesn't want to be accused of interfering in American domestic politics, Jia Qingguo, member of the Standing Committee of the national advisory body CPPCC said.</p>

<p>The Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) is a key component of the state governance system and a distinctively Chinese political institution.</p>

<p>The views of the Chinese general public are divided over Harris and Trump, but "I would prefer Harris because of the bad experience with Trump. We don't want to have that experience again," he told BBC in a rare comment voicing Beijing's preferred choice in the US presidential election.</p>

<p>During Trump's presidency, the relations declined sharply and the two countries ended up in serious confrontation. "From China's point of view, US Vice President Kamala Harris, who has worked under President Biden, represents the continuity," he said.</p>

<p>Trump, during his Presidency, was quite emotional and spread a lot of bad information about China, said Jia, who is also the Director of the Institute of Global Cooperation and Understanding of the Peking University.</p>

<p>"We have problems with the Biden admiration too," but Biden inherited a lot of tough measures initiated by Trump against China for the reasons of domestic politics and perhaps out of his ideological conviction, he said, adding, "Under Biden, the US policy towards China is more stable, predictable." "We are re-engaging with each other. Officials are meeting with each other, talking about issues," which he said is stabilising the relations.</p>

<p>While following a tough policy towards China, including firming up US policy to challenge Beijing's claims over the disputed South China Sea and Taiwan, and restricting China's ambitious move to export its electric vehicles, Biden, however, has maintained regular dialogue with President Xi Jinping to keep the tensions under control.</p>

<p>The relations between the top two economies nosedived under Trump, especially after COVID-19 broke out in the Chinese city of Wuhan in 2019 and led to a pandemic which had a devastating impact all over the world.</p>

<p>Trump has alleged that the virus responsible for the pandemic was leaked from a bio lab in Wuhan, prompting China to mount a massive propaganda offensive to counter Trump's allegations.</p>

<p>The former president had levied tariffs on the flourishing Chinese exports to the US to force Beijing to provide more access to the American goods.</p>

<p>The Biden administration is continuing with the tariffs on Chinese exports to the US, which last year amounted to over USD 500 billion compared to around USD 148 billion American exports to China.</p>

<p>Trump's threat to impose 60 per cent tariffs on Chinese goods, if he gets elected, is worrying Beijing as it may have a severe impact on China's economy which is bogged down with a slowdown.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An Indian American Democratic fundraiser on Thursday released a new digital video titled "I WILL VOTE FOR KAMALA HARRIS-TIM WALZ" to rally the South Asian voters in key battleground states.</p>

<p>The Bollywood-inspired video, set to the instrumental version from the movie Animal based on one of AR Rahman's iconic song "Dil Hai Chhota Sa, Chhoti Si Asha" from the movie Roja, is aimed at connecting with the South Asian communities across Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Georgia, Nevada, Arizona, and North Carolina.</p>

<p>"This is the moment for us to unite and show our support for Kamala Harris," said Ajay Bhutoria, National Finance Committee member for the Kamala Harris presidential campaign.</p>

<p>He also announced plans to release additional Bollywood-inspired videos as part of ongoing efforts to boost voter turnout for Harris and her running mate Tim Walz.</p>

<p>"The choice is clear between Kamala Harris' vision for a better future and Trump's divisiveness. Thousands of South Asian volunteers are organizing, knocking on doors, and making calls to help win this race," he said.</p>

<p>In the video, Bhutoria highlights how these themes resonate with Vice President Harris' message of hope and unity.</p>

<p>"Vice President Harris embodies joy and hope for our community. She's running to build a future that moves beyond the divisiveness of Donald Trump. She represents hope for over 5 million Indian Americans. We are using Bollywood music to engage our community and ensure their voices are heard," he said.</p>

<p>The video, conceptualized by Ajay and Vinita Bhutoria and produced by Ritesh Parikh of Awesome TV, features messages in multiple languages, including Telugu, Gujarati, Punjabi, Hindi, Bengali, Tamil, Malayalam and Urdu.</p>

<p>Parikh stated, "Bollywood has always connected people through stories, and Kamala Harris reflects that spirit by bringing people together. She brings joy and hope for all of us."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The United States has charged a former Indian intelligence officer for allegedly orchestrating a failed plot to kill Khalistani terrorist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun residing in New York City.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United States has charged a former Indian intelligence officer for allegedly orchestrating a failed plot to kill Khalistani terrorist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun residing in New York City.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The ex-officer, previously associated with the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW), is accused of coordinating an assassination attempt on Pannun, a dual US-Canadian citizen. The US Justice Department has charged him with murder-for-hire and money laundering.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The FBI will not tolerate acts of violence or other efforts to retaliate against those residing in the U.S. for exercising their constitutionally protected rights," FBI Director Christopher Wray said in a statement.</p>

<p>The plot allegedly began in May 2023, with the former officer, then reportedly an employee of the Indian government, allegedly collaborating with individuals in India and overseas to execute the assassination. Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, the intended target, is a designated terrorist in India and an advocate for Khalistan, a proposed independent Sikh homeland to be carved out of India.</p>

<p>According to Reuters, the ex-officer remains in India, but American officials are expected to pursue his extradition to face charges in the US.</p>

<p><strong>Plot Details</strong></p>

<p>The former RAW officer is accused of recruiting an Indian national, Nikhil Gupta, to execute the assassination. Mr Gupta was arrested in Prague last June, after travelling from India, and subsequently extradited to the US, where he pleaded not guilty to the charges. The indictment describes how Mr Gupta was hired to "orchestrate the assassination of the victim in the United States."</p>

<p>US authorities argue that Mr Gupta felt there was urgency in killing Pannun, particularly after the murder of another Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar, in Canada in 2023. According to the indictment, Mr Gupta believed that after Nijjar's killing, there was "now no need to wait" for Pannun's assassination.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to the indictment, the ex-officer and Mr Gupta allegedly contracted an individual to carry out the killing for $100,000. The FBI later discovered that the hired assassin was, in fact, an FBI informant working undercover. In June 2023, just days before Prime Minister Narendra Modi's state visit to the US, the informant received a $15,000 advance for the murder from the ex-officer and Mr Gupta. The transaction reportedly took place in a car in New York, and a photograph of the exchange has been included in the indictment.</p>

<p>The indictment also includes an alleged photograph of the ex-officer in military attire. The prosecutors allege that the former officer instructed Mr Gupta and the hired assassin to delay the killing until after PM Modi's visit to avoid diplomatic fallout during the high-profile event.</p>

<p>"A few minutes later, (the officer) messaged Gupta, instructing: 'Let them also verify by their own... if they are able to get some proof that he is inside... it will be a go ahead from us,'" the indictment reads.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>'Completely Unwarranted'</strong></h3>

<p>The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) yesterday confirmed that the "individual" named in the US Justice Department's indictment is no longer associated with the Indian government.</p>

<p>"The US State Department informed us that the individual in the Justice Department indictment is no longer employed by India. I confirm that he is no longer an employee of the Government of India," MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal.&nbsp;</p>

<p>US State Department Spokesperson Matthew Miller yesterday confirmed that the Indian delegation had met with an inter-agency team from the FBI, Department of Justice, and the State Department. "We are satisfied with the cooperation," Mr Miller told reporters. "It continues to be an ongoing process. We continue to work with them on that, but we do appreciate the cooperation, and we appreciate them updating us on their investigation as we update them on ours."</p>

<p>In September this year, a US court issued a summons to the Indian government over Pannun's civil suit, alleging a plot to murder him. The Indian government labelled the summons "completely unwarranted".&nbsp;</p>

<p>The summons had named Government of India, National Security Advisor Ajit Doval, former R&amp;AW chief Samant Goel, along with the former officer and Mr Gupta and sought a reply within 21 days.</p>

<p>Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri had said, "When these issues were first brought to our attention, we took action. There's a high-level committee engaged (in this matter). I invite your attention to the person who filed this."&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group said on Friday it was moving to a new and escalating phase in its war against Israel while Iran said "the spirit of resistance will be strengthened" after the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/israel-hamas-war-hamas-chief-yahya-sinwar-killed-in-gaza-strike-checking-says-israel-army-6811921">killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar</a>.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/hamas-leader-sinwar-unrepentant-amid-ongoing-israeli-assault-on-gaza-6812183">Sinwar, a mastermind of the Oct. 7, 2023</a>, attack that triggered the Gaza war, was killed during an operation by Israeli soldiers in the Palestinian enclave on Wednesday, a pivotal event in the year-long conflict.</p>

<p>Western leaders said his death offered an opportunity for the conflict to end, but Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the war would go on until the hostages seized by Hamas militants were returned.</p>

<p><strong>Also Read:&nbsp;</strong><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/benjamin-netanyahu-says-yahya-sinwar-killing-beginning-of-end-of-gaza-war-6814609">Netanyahu Says Yahya Sinwar Killing "Beginning Of End" Of Gaza War</a></p>

<p>"Today we have settled the score. Today evil has been dealt a blow but our task has still not been completed," Netanyahu said in a recorded video statement after the death was confirmed on Thursday.</p>

<p>"To the dear hostage families, I say: This is an important moment in the war. We will continue full force until all your loved ones, our loved ones, are home."</p>

<p>Sinwar, who was named as Hamas' overall leader following the assassination of political chief Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran in July, was believed to have been hiding in the warren of tunnels Hamas has built under Gaza over the past two decades.</p>

<p>He was killed during a gun battle in southern Gaza on Wednesday by Israeli troops who were initially unaware that they had caught their country's number one enemy, Israeli officials said.</p>

<p>The military released drone video of what it said was Sinwar, sitting on an armchair and covered in dust inside a destroyed building.</p>

<p>Hamas has not made any comment itself, but sources within the group have said the indications they have seen suggest Sinwar was indeed killed by Israeli troops.</p>

<p><strong>'Chief Obstacle'</strong></p>

<p>Despite Western hopes of a ceasefire, Sinwar's death could dial up hostilities in the Middle East where the prospect of an even wider conflict has grown.</p>

<p>Israel has launched a ground campaign in Lebanon over the past month and is now planning a response to an Oct. 1 missile attack carried out by Iran, ally of Hamas and Lebanon's Hezbollah.</p>

<p>But the demise of the man who planned the attack last year in which fighters killed 1,200 people in Israel and captured more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies, could also help push forward stalled efforts to end the war in which Israel has killed more than 42,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza health authorities.</p>

<p>U.S. President Joe Biden, who spoke to Netanyahu by phone to congratulate him, said Sinwar's death provided a chance for the conflict in Gaza to finally end and for Israeli hostages to be brought home.</p>

<p>The U.S. wants to kick-start talks on a proposal to achieve a ceasefire and secure the release of hostages, U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said, calling Sinwar the "chief obstacle" to ending the war.</p>

<p>"That obstacle has obviously been removed. Can't predict that that means whoever replaces (Sinwar) will agree to a ceasefire, but it does remove what has been in recent months the chief obstacle to getting one," he said. In recent weeks, Sinwar had refused to negotiate at all, Miller said.</p>

<p>Iran indicated no sign the killing would shift its support. "<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/spirit-of-resistance-will-be-strengthened-iran-after-yahya-sinwars-killing-6814884">The spirit of resistance will be strengthened</a>" following the death of Sinwar, its mission to the United Nations said.</p>

<p>Hezbollah was also defiant, announcing "the transition to a new and escalating phase in the confrontation with Israel".</p>

<p>U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken held separate phone calls on Thursday with leaders in Saudi Arabia and Qatar aimed at ending the conflict in the Middle East, the State Department said.</p>

<p><strong>No Comfort, No Compromise</strong></p>

<p>Families of Israeli hostages said that while the killing of Sinwar was a significant achievement, it would not be complete while hostages are still in Gaza.</p>

<p>Avi Marciano, the father of Noa Marciano, who was killed in captivity by Hamas, told Israeli broadcaster KAN that "the monster, the one who took her from me, who had the blood of all our daughters on his hands, finally met the gates of hell."</p>

<p>"A little justice, but no comfort," he said. "There will be comfort only when Naama, Liri, Agam, Daniela and Karina, our girls' friends, return home."</p>

<p>In Khan Younis in the south of the Gaza Strip, a displaced Palestinian named Thabet Amour told Reuters the Palestinian fight would continue.</p>

<p>"This is resistance that does not disappear when men disappear," he said. "The assassination of Sinwar will not lead to the end of the resistance or to a compromise or surrender and raising the white flag."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Israeli military on Thursday told how Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar was killed in a firefight after being tracked "going from home to home" desperately seeking to avoid detection in southern Gaza.</p>

<p>Israel has hailed the death of the 61-year-old Sinwar as one of the most important blows it has dealt Hamas since the Gaza war started with the group's October 7, 2023 attacks.</p>

<p>The Israeli military "confirms that after a year-long pursuit, yesterday (Wednesday), October 16, 2024, IDF (military) soldiers from the Southern Command eliminated Yahya Sinwar, the leader of the Hamas terrorist organisation, in an operation in the southern Gaza Strip," it said in a statement.</p>

<p>"The dozens of operations carried out by the IDF and the ISA (Shin Bet internal security agency) over the last year, and in recent weeks in the area where he was eliminated, restricted Yahya Sinwar's operational movement as he was pursued by the forces and led to his elimination," it added.</p>

<p>"IDF soldiers of the 828th Brigade (Bislach) operating in the area identified and eliminated three terrorists. After completing the process of identifying the body, it can be confirmed that Yahya Sinwar was eliminated."</p>

<p>In a later statement, military spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said Sinwar was killed after being spotted with two other fighters in the territory's Rafah district.</p>

<p>"The forces idenfitied three terrorists who were going from home to home on the run," Hagari told a briefing.</p>

<p>Troops engaged the group, forcing Sinwar to flee as the group dispersed after being shot. &nbsp;</p>

<p>"Sinwar ran away alone into one of the buildings and our forces scanned the area with a drone – which you can see in this film -- Yahya Sinwar injured his hand in the shooting, who can be seen here covered with his face, he threw a branch at the drone," said Hagari.</p>

<p><strong>- No hostages with Sinwar -</strong></p>

<p>Drone footage released by the military showed Sinwar alone in a blown-up apartment, with one hand severly injured and head covered in a traditional scarf, throwing a stick at the approaching drone during his final moments.</p>

<p>"We identified him as a terrorist inside a building and we shot into the building and we entered to scan the area. We found him with a gun and 40 thousand shekels. He was on the run and our forces eliminated him," said Hagari. &nbsp;</p>

<p>"Near the terrorists we eliminated were no hostages and our forces are now screening the area," he added.</p>

<p>Israel accuses Sinwar of being the mastermind of the October 7 attacks along with Hamas military chief Mohammed Deif.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said Deif was killed in a strike earlier this year though the Palestinian group has not confirmed it.</p>

<p>Sinwar in August replaced Hamas's former chief Ismail Haniyeh, who was killed in Iran on July 31. Israel has not commented on Haniyeh's death.</p>

<p>The Hamas attack last year resulted in the deaths of 1,206 people on Israeli soil, most of them civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures that include hostages killed in captivity.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory military offensive in Gaza has killed 42,438 people, a majority of them civilians, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry. The UN acknowledges the figures to be reliable.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One Direction pop star Liam Payne died of multiple traumas and internal bleeding after plunging from a hotel balcony in Buenos Aires, prosecutors said on Thursday, adding an initial search suggested the fall came after substance abuse.</p>

<p>Payne, 31, who shot to global fame with the boy band, was found dead after he fell from a third-floor hotel room balcony in Buenos Aires on Wednesday, triggering an outpouring of fan tributes.</p>

<p>In the first official details of the autopsy, the prosecutors office said coroners had found 25 injuries compatible with those caused by a fall from height, including fatal head injuries, with internal and external bleeding.</p>

<p>It added that there were no signs of a third party being involved, though the incident was being investigated as a "suspicious death" out of protocol.</p>

<p>"Everything indicates that the musician was alone when the fall occurred, and was going through some kind of episode due to substance abuse," the prosecutors office said.</p>

<p>"City police who surveyed the scene found substances inside the room that at first glance - and pending confirmation from the experts - would be narcotics and alcoholic beverages, as well as several destroyed objects and furniture," it added.</p>

<p>Police earlier said in a statement they had found the room in "total disorder" in a search after his death, with various things smashed and medications scattered around.</p>

<p>While details surrounding his death remain unclear, Payne had spoken publicly about his struggles with mental health and using alcohol to cope with the pressures of fame.</p>

<p><strong>WHISKEY, ANXIETY MEDICATION</strong></p>

<p>The city police said that in the atrium of the hotel where Payne had fallen they had found a bottle of whiskey, a lighter and a cellphone. They said they had collected fingerprints from those.</p>

<p>In the room of the luxury hotel in the city's trendy Palermo district, police said they found over-the-counter medications, energy packs and anxiety drug Clonazepam.</p>

<p>"Upon entering, total disorder was observed, with various elements broken," the police said in a statement, adding they had taken more fingerprints and other evidence to be analyzed in labs, as well as a notebook and passport.</p>

<p>"The balcony area was inspected in order to establish access to it," the police force added.</p>

<p>Before Payne's fall, a hotel employee had called emergency services, asking for help with a guest who was trashing his room and appeared to be under the influence of drugs or alcohol, audio obtained from the Buenos Aires security ministry showed.</p>

<p>"We have a guest who is intoxicated by drugs and alcohol. And, well, he's ... When he's conscious, he breaks, he's breaking the whole room. And, well, we need you to send someone, please," the hotel worker told police in the 911 call.</p>

<p>"We need you to send someone urgently because, well, I don't know if the guest's life is at risk. He is in a room with a balcony. And, well, we are a little afraid that he will do something that will put his life at risk."</p>

<p>One Direction found global success after Simon Cowell brought together Payne, Harry Styles, Zayn Malik, Niall Horan and Louis Tomlinson on Britain's X Factor talent show in 2010.</p>

<p>They went on to sell 70 million records, with six top-10 hits on Billboard's Hot 100, including "What Makes You Beautiful", "Story of My Life" and "Live While We're Young". Payne's co-writing credits included "Story of My Life" and "Night Changes".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said late Thursday that the killing of Hamas chief Yahya Sinwar was the "beginning of the end" of the war in Gaza.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Thursday that the killing of Hamas chief Yahya Sinwar in the Gaza Strip was the "beginning of the end" of the year-long war in the Palestinian territory.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said that after a lengthy hunt, troops had on Wednesday "eliminated Yahya Sinwar, the leader of the Hamas terrorist organisation, in an operation in the southern Gaza Strip".</p>

<p>Hamas has not confirmed his death.</p>

<p>Netanyahu, who vowed to crush Hamas at the start of the war, hailed Sinwar's killing, saying: "While this is not the end of the war in Gaza, it's the beginning of the end."</p>

<p>He had earlier called Sinwar's death an "important landmark in the decline of the evil rule of Hamas".</p>

<p>The chief of Hamas in Gaza at the time of the October 7 attack that sparked the war, Sinwar became the militant group's overall leader after the killing in July of its political chief, Ismail Haniyeh.</p>

<p>He is said to have masterminded the October 7 attack, the deadliest in Israeli history, which resulted in the deaths of 1,206 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of official Israeli figures that includes hostages killed in captivity.</p>

<p>Israel's announcement of Sinwar's death comes weeks after it assassinated Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah in a strike in Lebanon, where the Israeli military has been at war since late September.</p>

<p>With Hamas already weakened more than a year into the Gaza war, Sinwar's death deals an immense blow to the organisation.</p>

<p>US President Joe Biden, whose government is Israel's top arms provider, said: "This is a good day for Israel, for the United States, and for the world."</p>

<p>"There is now the opportunity for a 'day after' in Gaza without Hamas in power, and for a political settlement that provides a better future for Israelis and Palestinians alike."</p>

<p><strong>- 'Settling the score' -</strong></p>

<p>Militants also seized 251 hostages during the October 7 attack and took them into Gaza. Ninety-seven remain there, including 34 who Israeli officials say are dead.</p>

<p>Following the attack, Netanyahu vowed to defeat Hamas and bring home all the hostages.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory campaign has killed 42,438 people in Gaza, the majority civilians, according to data from the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory, figures which the UN considers reliable.</p>

<p>Israeli military chief Herzi Halevi said: "We are settling the score with Sinwar, who is responsible for that very difficult day a year ago."</p>

<p>He vowed the military would keep fighting "until we capture all the terrorists involved in the October 7 massacre and bring all the hostages home".</p>

<p>Some Israelis hailed the news of Sinwar's death as a sign of better things to come.</p>

<p>"I am celebrating the death of Sinwar, who has brought us nothing but harm, who has taken people hostage," said one Israeli woman, Hemda, who only gave her first name.</p>

<p>Attending a Tel Aviv rally demanding the hostages' release, 60-year-old Sisil, who also gave only her first name, said his killing presented a "once in a lifetime opportunity" for "a hostage deal to end the war".</p>

<p>But whether the Hamas chief's death will bring the end of the war any closer is unclear.</p>

<p>Warning that the hostages were in "grave danger", Israeli military historian Guy Aviad said Sinwar's killing was "a significant event... but it's not the end of the war".</p>

<p>Campaign group the Hostages and Missing Families Forum urged the Israeli government and international mediators to leverage "this major achievement to secure hostages' return".</p>

<p>According to a statement from Netanyahu's office, Biden called him to congratulate him on Sinwar's killing, with the two leaders vowing to seize "an opportunity to promote the release of the hostages".</p>

<p>Netanyahu said Palestinian militants should free the hostages if they want to live.</p>

<p><strong>- Final moments -</strong></p>

<p>The Israeli military said Sinwar was killed in a firefight in southern Gaza's Rafah, near the Egyptian border, while being tracked by a drone.</p>

<p>It released drone footage of what it said was Sinwar's final moments, with the video showing a wounded militant throwing an object at the drone.</p>

<p>With the civilian toll in Gaza mounting, Israel has faced criticism over its conduct of the war, including from the United States.</p>

<p>In northern Gaza's Jabalia, two hospitals said Israeli air strikes on a school sheltering displaced people killed at least 14 people, though the military reported that it had hit militants.</p>

<p>According to a UN-backed assessment, some 345,000 Gazans face "catastrophic" levels of hunger this winter.</p>

<p>Nearly 100 percent of Gaza's population now lives in poverty, the UN's International Labour Organization said, warning that the war's impact on Gaza "will be felt for generations to come".</p>

<p><strong>- War in Lebanon -</strong></p>

<p>Israel is also fighting a war in Lebanon, where Hamas ally Hezbollah opened a front by launching cross-border strikes that forced tens of thousands of Israelis to flee their homes.</p>

<p>Hezbollah said Thursday it was launching a new phase in its war against Israel, saying it had used precision-guided missiles against troops for the first time.</p>

<p>On the same day, Israel conducted strikes on the south Lebanese city of Tyre, where the militant group and its allies hold sway.</p>

<p>The Lebanese National News Agency reported strikes on the Bekaa Valley, after Israel had issued an evacuation warning for civilians there.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said five soldiers were killed in combat in southern Lebanon, taking to 19 the number of troop deaths announced since Israel began raids into Lebanon last month.</p>

<p>In Lebanon, the war since late September has left at least 1,418 people dead, according to an AFP tally of Lebanese health ministry figures, though the real toll is likely higher.</p>

<p>The war has also drawn in other Iran-aligned armed groups, including in Yemen, Iraq and Syria.</p>

<p>Iran on October 1 conducted a missile strike on Israel, for which Israel has vowed to retaliate.</p>

<p>Tehran's mission to the United Nations said Thursday that Sinwar's killing would lead to the strengthening of "resistance" in the region.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump has said "only stupid people put old people" in positions on the Supreme Court - ironically letting slip that he himself is a 78-year-old running for the highest office in the US government.</p>

<p>It has not always been Joe Biden at the receiving end of age-related backlash, but also Trump, who will be 82 years old by the time he completes his term, if elected.</p>

<p>He is also, currently, the oldest nominee for president in United States history and has time and again been the target for the Democrats who have thrown doubts down his way regarding his ability to serve office.</p>

<p>"It's amazing, because I got three in four years," Trump said about his appointments to the US Supreme Court during an interview to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://youtu.be/HlWT6nYZ4OU?si=0oOMlQYMf3jPUIOa&amp;t=2140" rel="No follow, no index" target="_blank">Bloomberg</a>. "Most people get none. Because, you know, you put them in, they're young. You tend to put them in young." He continued on to say, "Only stupid people put old. You know, you don't put old in, because they're there for two years or three years, right?"</p>

<p>Trump's Supreme Court appointments, including Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett, skewed younger than typical, with an average age of 50, compared to the historical average of 60.</p>

<p>The three Supreme Court appointees of President Trump have significantly contributed to the conservative majority in the court, leading to notable changes in federal precedents. One of the most significant outcomes of this shift is the overturning of Roe vs Wade, a landmark ruling that previously protected the right to abortion care.</p>

<p>When the interviewer called attention to his age being 78, Trump brushed off the question and continued to talk about his Supreme Court appointees, "So, I got three," he responded. "A lot of presidents get none, I got three. And, uh, I think they've been three great choices too, by the way."</p>

<p>There have been questions raised about Trump's mental fitness for the office since he has gone on long frequent rambles at rallies, ignored or missed questions and recently, spent time swaying at a town hall instead of answering questions.</p>

<p>Dr. Ben Michaelis, a clinical psychologist, told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-mental-health-fears-cognitive-decline-b2625124.html" rel="No follow, no index" target="_blank">The Independent</a> that Trump is "really not in a strong cognitive place."</p>

<p>"There's a term when you're talking about people with dementia called sundowning, it's a lot harder for them as the day goes on," he said, "It's very difficult for them to maintain focus on a topic. The idea of being able to maintain that level of focus for that amount of time, that late in the day...you wouldn't think twice about it if that was your grandfather. It's just he happens to be running for president."<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has never been one to abide by rules. Four years ago he cried fraud and did not accept the presidential election result and there could be a possibility of him doing the same this time around after the November 5 election.</p>

<p>This time the only difference will be that Trump will not have his presidential levers of power which he had in the 2020 elections. Moreover, new laws have been implemented in the US to make it more difficult to influence election results.</p>

<h2><strong>THE DENIAL</strong></h2>

<p>"If I lose - I'll tell you what, it's possible. Because they cheat. That's the only way we're gonna lose, because they cheat," Trump said at a Michigan rally in September. Trump's team filed over 60 lawsuits, but none of them succeeded in altering or delaying the vote count.</p>

<p>After losing the 2020 presidential election, Donald Trump and his supporters launched an unprecedented effort to overturn the results. This endeavor involved spreading baseless claims of election fraud and rigging through the "big lie" propaganda technique.</p>

<h3><strong>CIVIL UNREST?</strong></h3>

<p>In 2021, Republican supporters charged the US Capitol in an effort to stop Mike Pence from confirming Joe Biden's victory.</p>

<p>Any effort by Trump to suggest the election was rigged could potentially lead to civil unrest, as it did on Jan. 6, 2021.</p>

<p>According to Reuters, experts who monitor violent groups and militia, such as Peter Montgomery of the People For the American Way, a liberal think tank, say they are less concerned about a violent response from these groups than they are about threats against election workers counting votes. There also could be violent demonstrations in the capitals of battleground states, Montgomery said.</p>

<p>Still, Trump and his allies have been crafting a blueprint for months to cry if he loses on November 5th.</p>

<p>Following the November 5 election, Republicans and Democrats anticipate a potentially lengthy vote-counting process that may extend well beyond Election Day, as mail-in ballots are processed and other votes are carefully verified and tallied.</p>

<p>In case it seems like Trump is losing, the delay in counting will give him a window to claim fraud while sowing seeds of doubt about election officials and although he has been threatening to put election workers and public workers behind bars, he would need to win the election first in order for that to be materialised.</p>

<h3><strong>BUILD-UP IN KEY BATTLEGROUNDS</strong></h3>

<p>In anticipation of potential election controversies, Republicans have preemptively filed more than 100 lawsuits in crucial battleground states. These lawsuits seek to establish a basis for post-election challenges, including claims - thus far unsupported by evidence - of widespread voting by non-citizens.</p>

<p>Both major parties are gearing up to deploy thousands of trained volunteers, known as poll watchers, to keep a close eye on voting and vote counting during the upcoming election. These volunteers will be tasked with reporting any irregularities they spot. However, some voting rights advocates are sounding the alarm, worried that Republican poll watchers might disrupt the process, even though the Republican Party noted that the volunteers have been instructed to abide by the law.</p>

<p>States must submit their election results by December, ahead of the Electoral College meeting. Electors will then cast their votes, which are subsequently sent to Congress for formal verification in January, marking the final step in confirming the presidential election outcome.</p>

<h3><strong>DELAYS AND MISSED DEADLINES</strong></h3>

<p>Efforts to contest election results, fueled by Trump's influence, may cause certification delays and missed deadlines. This could provide grounds for Republican lawmakers to dispute the outcome, with uncertain legal consequences due to potentially biased judicial decisions.</p>

<p>In response to Trump's 2020 election challenges, Congress enacted reforms to prevent similar disruptions. The new law clarifies the vice president's limited role, prohibiting them from delaying certification or discarding state results, as Trump had urged Pence to do.</p>

<p>The measure also requires that an objection to a state's electoral count cannot be brought unless one-fifth of the members of each house of Congress agrees. After that, it takes a majority vote in each house for an objection to be found valid.</p>

<p>In the unexpected outcome that enough electoral votes are tossed so that neither candidate reaches the majority, the newly elected US House of Representatives would choose the next president.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The UAE is celebrating its 53rd National Day, also known as Eid Al Etihad, on December 2, which gives residents an occasion to reflects on the country's journey of resilience, determination and success. The Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation (MoHRE) has announced official paid holidays for December 2 and 3 (Monday and Tuesday) for all private sector employees in the UAE. Since the dates coincide with Saturday and Sunday, this gives UAE residents a chance to celebrate long weekend.</p>

<h3><strong>Why is UAE National Day celebrated?</strong></h3>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://economymiddleeast.com/news/uae-national-day-most-popular-destinations-to-travel/" rel="noindex,nofollow">local outlets</a>, Eid Al Etihad commemorates the historic moment when in 1971 when the seven emirates came together to form a unified nation under the leadership of Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan.</p>

<p>'Spirit of the Union' is the official theme of the UAE's National Day celebrations. Several events are organised for the residents to celebrate the occasion.</p>

<h3><strong>Guidelines for UAE residents on National Day</strong></h3>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.khaleejtimes.com/life-and-living/uae-holidays/eid-al-etihad-holidays-uae-announces-14-rules-for-53rd-national-day-celebrations" rel="noindex,nofollow"><em>Khaleej Times</em></a> said that the UAE government has banned random marches or gatherings.

<ul>
	<li>Adhere to all traffic regulations and follow instructions issued by police officers</li>
	<li>Refrain from using party sprays by drivers, passengers or pedestrians</li>
	<li>Ensure the vehicle's front and rear license plates remain visible; do not alter the vehicle's colour or darken/tint the front windows</li>
	<li>Do not place stickers, signs or logos of any kind on the vehicle unless they are specifically for Eid Al Etihad and comply with official guidelines and conditions</li>
	<li>Do not exceed the permitted number of passengers in a vehicle, and do not let anyone out through the windows or the sunroof of your car</li>
	<li>Avoid making unauthorised modifications to the vehicle or adding unlicensed features that cause noise or obstruct vision</li>
	<li>Do not obstruct traffic, block roads for emergency vehicles (ambulance, civil defence, police patrols), or perform stunts on internal or external roads</li>
	<li>Do not cover the vehicle's side, front, or rear windows with stickers, and avoid using sunshades that block visibility</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>Things to do during UAE National Day celebrations</strong></h3>

<p>Celebrations in Dubai will be held for six days - from November 28 to December 3 - with shopping deals, acts by acrobats, musical performances, fireworks, and a range of culinary experiences.</p>

<p>The city of Sharjah has made entry to all public museums free on December 1 and 2.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Spain has introduced a new law for tourists visiting the country, making it mandatory for them to tell authorities about hotels they are going to stay in, the car they will rent and share several other personal details. The new rules will come into effect from December 2 and have sparked a debate on social media, especially among tourists from the UK, since it is the most popular destination for British holidaymakers. The Spanish government has said they are necessary moves to protect its citizens from organised crime and terrorism.</p>

<p>Spanish hotels currently ask guests for their ID cards or passport details but the new decree requires businesses to collect up to 31 pieces of data.</p>

<p>Social media users are slamming the "Big Brother" attitude.</p>

<p>"Boycott Spanish islands altogether, rather go to Turkiye anyway," one user commented. "No great loss there. I hated my two weeks on holiday there," said another.</p>

<h3><strong>Spain defends the new rule</strong></h3>

<p>In a statement, Spain's Secretaria de Estado de Seguridad (State Secretariat for Security) said, "The greatest attacks on public safety are carried out by both terrorist activity and organised crime, in both cases with a marked transnational character."</p>

<p>It added that foreign nationals are involved in "terrorist threats and other serious crimes".</p>

<p>The new rules will also be applicable on guests staying at Airbnb.</p>

<h3><strong>What details are being sought?</strong></h3>

<p>From December 2, tourists will have to share personal details such as:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Full name</li>
	<li>Gender</li>
	<li>Nationality</li>
	<li>Passport number</li>
	<li>Date of birth</li>
	<li>Home address</li>
	<li>Landline phone number (if you have one)</li>
	<li>Mobile phone number</li>
	<li>Email address</li>
</ul>

<p>Those under the age of 14 are exempt from the new rule, but adults travelling with them must explain their relationship with children.</p>

<p>It is important to note that there are no penal provisions on tourists, but accommodation providers will be fined if proper data is not collected.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Gregg Wallace's lawyers have denied all the allegations but MasterChef's production company has launched an investigation against him.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Television presenter Gregg Wallace will step away from his role on MasterChef after allegations of misconduct, the production company said on Thursday. At least 13 people, who worked with Wallace over a period of 17 years, have come forward accusing him of inappropriate sexual comments, the <em>BBC</em> said in a report. One of them is broadcaster Kirsty Wark, who was a Celebrity MasterChef contestant in 2011. She told the <em>BBC</em> that Wallace told "sexualised" jokes during the filming of the show.</p>

<p>Wallace's lawyers have denied all the allegations but MasterChef's production company has launched an investigation and said the presenter is cooperating.</p>

<p>Ms Wark said her overall experience while filming the show was "joyous" but added, "The fly in the ointment, on occasion, was Gregg Wallace."</p>

<p>"I was actually more angry than anything else, because I thought it was so inappropriate. And in a sense what I thought was it was about power more than anything else, that he felt he could," said Ms Wark.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdje0kp7zewo" rel="noindex,nofollow"><em>BBC</em> said</a> during the investigation, they found Wallace openly talked about his sex life, taking his top off in front of a female co-worker and telling a junior female colleague he wasn't wearing any boxer shorts under his jeans.</p>

<p>Rod Stewart, whose wife, Penny Lancaster, appeared on Celebrity MasterChef in 2021, reacted to Wallace's break from the show, calling him a "tubby, bald-headed, ill-mannered bully".</p>

<p>"So Greg Wallace gets fired from Master Chef. Good riddance Wallace... You humiliated my wife when she was on the show, but you had that bit cut out didn't you? You're a tubby, bald-headed, ill-mannered bully. Karma got ya. Sir Rod Stewart," Stewart said in the post.</p>

<p>Wallace, meanwhile, posted a video on Instagram on Thursday thanking people for supporting him.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Around&nbsp;<a href="https://www.aihw.gov.au/reports/covid-19/long-covid-in-australia-a-review-of-the-literature/summary">5–10%</a>&nbsp;of people with COVID infections go on to experience long COVID, with symptoms lasting three months or more.</p>

<p>Researchers have proposed&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41579-022-00846-2">several biological mechanisms</a>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<a href="https://theconversation.com/long-covid-puzzle-pieces-are-falling-into-place-the-picture-is-unsettling-233759">explain</a>&nbsp;long COVID. However, in a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mja.com.au/journal/2024/221/11/towards-cure-long-covid-strengthening-case-persistently-replicating-sars-cov-2">perspective article</a>&nbsp;published in the latest Medical Journal of Australia, we argue that much, if not all, long COVID appears to be driven by the virus itself persisting in the body.</p>

<p>Since relatively early in the pandemic, there has been a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41590-023-01601-2">recognition</a>&nbsp;that in some people, SARS-CoV-2 – or at least remnants of the virus – could stay in various tissues and organs for extended periods. This theory is known as “viral persistence”.</p>

<p>While the long-term presence of residual viral fragments in some people's bodies is now well established, what remains less certain is whether live virus itself, not just old bits of virus, is lingering – and if so, whether this is what causes long COVID. This distinction is crucial because live virus can be targeted by specific antiviral approaches in ways that “dead” viral fragments cannot.</p>

<p>Viral persistence has&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41579-024-01125-y">two significant implications</a>:</p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p>when it occurs in some highly immunocompromised people, it is thought to be the source of new and substantially different-looking variants,&nbsp;<a href="https://theconversation.com/the-emergence-of-jn-1-is-an-evolutionary-step-change-in-the-covid-pandemic-why-is-this-significant-220285">such as JN.1</a></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>it has the potential to continue to cause symptoms in many people in the wider population long beyond the acute illness. In other words, long COVID could be caused by a long infection.</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<h2>What does the research say?</h2>

<p>While there remains no single study that confirms that persistent virus is the cause of long COVID, collectively several recent key papers make a compelling case.</p>

<p>In February, a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07029-4">study in Nature found</a>&nbsp;a high number of people with mild COVID symptoms had extended periods of shedding the genetic material of the virus, so-called viral RNA, from their respiratory tract. Those with persistent shedding of this viral RNA – which almost certainly represents the presence of live virus – were at higher risk of long COVID.</p>

<p>Other key papers detected replicating&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanmic/article/PIIS2666-5247(24)00055-7/fulltext">viral RNA</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(24)00211-1/fulltext">proteins</a>&nbsp;in blood fluid of patients years after their initial infection, a sign that the virus is likely replicating for long periods in some hidden reservoirs in the body, perhaps including blood cells.</p>

<figcaption>The virus could be hiding out, causing symptoms of long COVID.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-illustration/coronavirus-covid19-sars-3d-render-1668331930">tonecgi/Shutterstock</a></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Another study&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(24)00171-3/fulltext">detected</a>&nbsp;viral RNA in ten different tissue sites and blood samples 1–4 months after acute infection. This study found the risk of long COVID (measured four months following infection) was higher in those with persistently positive viral RNA.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(24)00171-3/fulltext">same study</a>&nbsp;also gave clues about where in the body the persisting virus resides. The gastrointestinal tract is one site of considerable interest as a long-term viral hideout.</p>

<p>Earlier this week, further&nbsp;<a href="https://www.clinicalmicrobiologyandinfection.com/article/S1198-743X(24)00432-4/abstract">evidence</a>&nbsp;of persistent virus increasing likelihood of long COVID has been published as part of the&nbsp;<a href="https://recovercovid.org/about#whatIs">RECOVER initiative</a>, a collaborative research project that aims to address the impacts of long COVID.</p>

<p>However, formal proof that virus capable of replicating can last for years in the body remains elusive. This is because isolating the live virus from reservoirs inside the body where the virus “hides” is technically challenging.</p>

<p>In its absence, we and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/long-covid-trials-aim-clear-lingering-virus-help-patients-need">other</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(24)00886-9?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0092867424008869%3Fshowall%3Dtrue">scientists</a>&nbsp;argue the cumulative evidence is now sufficiently compelling to galvanise action.</p>

<h2>What needs to happen next?</h2>

<p>The obvious response to this is to fast-track&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(24)00436-5/fulltext">trials of known antivirals</a>&nbsp;for prevention and cure of long COVID.</p>

<p>This should include more left-field therapies such as the diabetes drug metformin. This has possible dual benefits in the context of long COVID:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>its antiviral properties, which have&nbsp;<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37302406/">demonstrated surprising efficacy</a>&nbsp;against long COVID</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>as a potential therapeutic in treating impairments related to fatigue.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<figcaption>Some existing medicines could be repurposed to treat long COVID.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/more-hands-equals-less-work-shot-2268099249">PeopleImages.com - Yuri A/Shutterstock</a></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>However, another major thrust should be the development of new drugs and the establishment of clinical trial platforms for rapid testing.</p>

<p>Science has uncovered exciting therapeutic options. But translating these into forms usable in the clinic is a large hurdle that requires support and investment from governments.</p>

<h2>Demystify and preventing long COVID</h2>

<p>The notion of “long infection” as a contributor or even the driver of long COVID is a powerful message. It could help demystify the condition in the eyes of the wider community and increase awareness among the general public as well as medical professionals.</p>

<p>It should help raise awareness in the community of the importance of reducing rates of re-infection. It is not just your first infection, but each subsequent COVID infection&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/long-term-effects/index.html">carries a risk of long COVID</a>.</p>

<p>Long COVID is common and isn't restricted to those at high risk of severe acute disease but affects all age groups. In one&nbsp;<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.5694/mja2.52467">study</a>, the highest impact was in those aged 30 to 49 years.</p>

<p>So, for now, we all need to reduce our exposure to the virus with the tools available, a combination of:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p><a href="https://theconversation.com/grattan-on-friday-experts-want-albanese-to-lead-on-indoor-air-quality-as-part-of-pandemic-planning-239829">clean indoor air approaches</a>. In its simplest form, this means being conscious of the importance of well-ventilated indoor spaces, opening the windows and improving airflow as COVID spreads through air. More sophisticated ways of ensuring indoor air is safe involve monitoring quality and filtering air in spaces that cannot be easily naturally ventilated</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>using high-quality masks (that are well-fitting and don't let air in easily, such as N95-type masks) in settings where you don't have confidence of the quality of the indoor air and/or that are crowded</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>testing, so you know when you're positive. Then, if you're eligible, you can get treatment. And you can be vigilant about protecting those around you with masks, staying at home where possible, and ventilating spaces</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>staying up to date with COVID booster doses. Vaccines&nbsp;<a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.11.19.24317487v1.full">reduce long COVID</a>&nbsp;and other&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/antimicrobial-stewardship-and-healthcare-epidemiology/article/effectiveness-of-covid19-vaccine-in-the-prevention-of-postcovid-conditions-a-systematic-literature-review-and-metaanalysis-of-the-latest-research/A0B115B5D3AA60846799857B801D116E">post-COVID complications</a>.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Hopefully one day there will be better treatments and even a cure for long COVID. But in the meantime, increased awareness of the biomedical basis of long COVID should prompt clinicians to take patients more seriously as they attempt to access the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(24)01136-X/fulltext">treatments</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/House/Health_Aged_Care_and_Sport/LongandrepeatedCOVID/Report">services</a>&nbsp;that already exist.</p>

<p>In 2021, during their first deployment together, the experienced detection dog proved invaluable, helping May cope with the isolation and challenges of military life. “They see the best of you and the worst of you. “They're there with you when you go to sleep, they're there for you when you wake up … they give you a sense of purpose.” May told <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/28/us/military-sergeant-k9-reunion-thanksgiving/index.html" rel="nofollow noindex">CNN.</a></p>

<p>Their companionship included sharing a small bed on base and enduring the hardships of deployment side by side. But after returning to the US in the spring of 2022, May was reassigned to Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland in Texas, while Yyacob stayed behind at Fort Drum, New York. “It was kind of soul-crushing,” May said of being separated from Yyacob. The emotional toll of that departure lingered, especially as Yyacob, too, struggled with separation anxiety and was unable to work with a new handler.</p>

<p>May, a veteran with a long family history of military service, had enlisted at 18 and initially considered leaving the Army in 2019. It was then that the opportunity to become a K-9 handler emerged, a role that May described as rare and highly sought after. After completing the rigorous Military Working Dog Handler Course in 2020, May met Yyacob, who was known for being energetic and a bit unruly. Their immediate bond grew stronger through months of training and joint missions, including protecting high-profile officials.</p>

<p>When Yyacob retired from active duty, May began to consider adopting him. The 2016 National Defense Authorization Act grants handlers the first right to adopt their retired dogs, but connecting with the right person can be difficult. With the support of American Humane, May's efforts paid off when Yyacob's retirement was confirmed in October. The animal care expert, April Smith, was tasked with preparing Yyacob for his new life, spending two days with him at Fort Drum before flying with him to San Antonio, complete with his seat on the plane.</p>

<p>Smith described the instant recognition between the two during their reunion, stating, “Of all the dogs I have transported, Yyacob, realizing who was there to see him, was so quick. He knew exactly who that was.”</p>

<p>For May, it was a bittersweet moment, as it coincided with the recent loss of his other dog, Towzer. “It didn't really feel real at first,” he said, acknowledging that while it had not been an exceptionally long time, it had felt like “it's been forever.”</p>

<p>American Humane has pledged to cover Yyacob's veterinary care for life, easing the financial burden for May, considering the dog's need for anxiety medicines. “It takes a weight off of our shoulders, especially as military people, because we don't make that much as it is. And with the way things are nowadays, everything's getting expensive, it just takes a whole load off of us,” May said.</p>

<p>May now works as an instructor for the Military Working Dog Handler Course and shared his excitement at the prospect of travelling with Yyacob. “I plan on just seeing the world with him, getting him out and actually letting him live his life as a dog. Whether that's going to parks and throwing a ball with him or just riding around with me in the car, it doesn't matter. Just (making) sure he's with me. That's all that matters to me,” May told CNN.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An Israeli woman, who was in Hamas captivity for 54 days, has marked the first anniversary of her freedom with engagement to her childhood friend. Mia Schem, who became a prominent voice for the release of hostages following her ordeal, shared the news on November 28 after Yinon Hassan, 24, proposed to her in Caesarea, a picturesque coastal city.</p>

<p>Hassan, who started his relationship with Schem following her release in last November's initial wave of hostage exchanges, proposed to her by getting down on one knee and asking for her hand in marriage, according to <a href="http://https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/article-831224" rel="nofollow noindex">The Jerusalem Post</a>. Schem posted their photos celebrating the engagement, flaunting her ring and sharing a kiss.</p>

<p>Her post received an outpouring of support from the public, with Israeli restaurants even offering to host or cater for her upcoming bachelorette party.</p>

<p>Speculation about their engagement began in August 2024 when Schem took part in a fashion campaign for an Israeli designer, showcasing a wedding dress while proudly displaying the scars from the October 7, 2023, attack. The former hostage was among those captured during the raid at the Tribe of Nova music festival. She also had a gunshot wound in her arm.</p>

<p>Schem was prominently featured in early Hamas propaganda videos, where she was coerced into praising the three-hour surgery performed on her by her captors. She later recounted the excruciating pain from her injury, revealing her captors did not attempt to alleviate her suffering. She was also confined in a cage for days and subjected to cruel taunts, including watching news reports in which her mother pleaded for her safe return.</p>

<p>Since her release, Schem has become a strong advocate for the hostages still held in Gaza, pushing for greater awareness and action. Speaking during a recent visit to New York, she explained the purpose behind her advocacy.</p>

<p>“I must fight for the rest of the hostages — this is my life. I feel that I have a mission — to speak, to tell the world my story, for the other hostages who can't. And to be the voice for the girls still there,” she told <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/28/world-news/former-hamas-hostage-mia-schem-gets-engaged-one-year-after-she-was-freed/" rel="nofollow noindex">The New York Post</a> earlier in November.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A pulsar which can be at most a few thousand light years away, could be the source of the cosmic rays.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Scientists have discovered high-energy cosmic rays after over a decade of painstaking data collection that can unlock new avenues about our understanding of the universe regarding cosmic processes that emit colossal amounts of energy. Researchers at the H.E.S.S (High Energy Stereoscopic System) observatory, located in Namibia, discovered the cosmic electrons and positrons that have energies over 10 tera-electronvolts (1 TeV corresponds to 10*12 electronvolts), which is about 1000-billion times greater than that of visible light, the findings published in journal <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.133.221001" rel="noindex, nofollow"><em>Physical Review Letters </em></a>showed.</p>

<p>"We've uncovered data in a crucial and previously unexplored energy range. It's likely to remain a benchmark for the coming years," said Werner Hofmann from the Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics in Heidelberg.</p>

<p>Since these charged particles are deflected in all directions by the magnetic field in the cosmic background, scientists say it is difficult to determine their origin. However, they speculate that a pulsar (stellar remnants with a strong magnetic field), which can be at most a few thousand light years away, could be the source. Notably, such particles come from all sorts of wild cosmic events like exploding stars (supernovae), distant galaxies, and even our own sun during solar flares.</p>

<h3><strong>How was the discovery made?</strong></h3>

<p>The scientists analysed a huge data set collected over a decade by four of the H.E.S.S telescopes. They used a new algorithm based on a pixel-by-pixel comparison, using sophisticated statistical modelling to identify cosmic electrons with unprecedentedly low background contamination.</p>

<p>This resulted in a statistically high-quality data set for the analysis of cosmic electrons. In particular, the researchers succeeded in measuring electrons and positrons with energies of up to 40 TeV.</p>

<h3><strong>What is H.E.S.S?</strong></h3>

<p>The High Energy Stereoscopic System is a ground-based gamma-ray telescope in the highlands of Namibia and sensitive in the energy range from 50 GeV to 100 TeV. It consists of four 12-metre diameter reflecting telescopes surrounding a central telescope.</p>

<p>The observatory captures and records the faint Cherenkov radiation produced by the heavily charged particles and photons that enter the Earth's atmosphere, producing a shower of particles in their wake. During its more than 15 years of observation, H.E.S.S has helped with the discovery of over 100 sources in comparison to the around 12 sources known before its observations began.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Brazilian bodybuilder Jose Mateus Correia Silva, 28, collapsed during a gym workout and died despite resuscitation attempts.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jose Mateus Correia Silva, a 28-year-old Brazilian bodybuilder and fitness entrepreneur, died while working out at a gym in Aguas Claras, Brasilia, according to<em> The New York Post. </em>Jose was well-respected in the fitness community and well-known for competing in bodybuilding events, such as the South American Championships. Jose had a massive heart attack and abruptly collapsed while working out with his friends in the gym.</p>

<p>As per the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/28/lifestyle/bodybuilder-28-dies-from-cardiac-arrest-at-the-gym/?utm_campaign=nypost&amp;utm_medium=referral"><em>news report, </em></a>in order to try resuscitation, one of his friends-a firefighter-hurried him to a local fire station. He was not able to be revived after more than an hour of tries.</p>

<p>The unexpected loss has left his family, friends, and admirers in shock. Jose was not only a bodybuilder but also a lawyer, nutritionist, and fitness entrepreneur.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I want to thank the entire team that tried to save his life," his brother, Tiago, said in a statement after he passed, noting that Jose had no prior health conditions. "They were all very professional and provided all the support."</p>

<p>This is not the first time a young bodybuilder, a regular person doing a gym workout, has died. In September this year, a 19-year-old bodybuilder from Brazil was found dead at his home, allegedly due to a heart attack. <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/teenage-bodybuilder-with-brilliant-future-ahead-dies-aged-19-6486154">Matheus Pavlak </a>had transformed his body in just five years after taking up the sport to overcome obesity. He was a regular competitor and a rising star in the bodybuilding community, particularly in the southern Brazilian state of Santa Catarina, where he lived. He recently placed fourth and sixth in regional competitions and won the U23 contest in 2023, becoming "Mr Blumenau" in his hometown.</p>

<p>Also in September, another very strong and muscular bodybuilder, known for his huge arms and chest, died suddenly at the age of 36. Known for his 25-inch biceps and 61-inch chest, he was from Belarus and famous for sharing videos of his intense workouts online. Many people admired his incredible physique and called him "The Mutant." Sadly, he had a heart attack and passed away a few days after being hospitalised.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[About 1.5 million years ago, individuals of two different species in the human evolutionary lineage trudged on a muddy lakeshore in northern Kenya.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>About 1.5 million years ago, individuals of two different species in the human evolutionary lineage trudged on a muddy lakeshore in northern Kenya, leaving behind intersecting trackways alongside the footprints of antelopes, horses, warthogs, giant storks and other animals.</p>

<p>These tracks turned into fossils that scientists have now discovered at a location called Koobi Fora, providing the first evidence that these two species - Paranthropus boisei and Homo erectus - shared the same landscape, literally crossing paths. The discovery raises intriguing questions about the relationship between the two species and any competition for resources.</p>

<p>Paranthropus boisei, the more distantly related to modern humans of the two, lived from about 2.3 to 1.2 million years ago, standing up to about 4 feet 6 inches (137 cm) tall. They had a skull adapted for large chewing muscles, including a cranial crest like those in male gorillas, as well as massive molars. Their feet bore ape-like traits including in the big toe.</p>

<p>Homo erectus, an early member of our evolutionary line with body proportions like those of Homo sapiens, lived from about 1.89 million to 110,000 years ago, ranging from about 4 feet 9 inches to 6 feet 1 inch (145-185 cm) tall. They had large brow ridges and bigger brains than Paranthropus boisei, though smaller than our species.</p>

<p>The researchers found the footprints in 2021 in the vicinity of Lake Turkana. They identified one long trackway of 12 footprints, each about 10.25 inches (26 cm) long, attributed to an adult Paranthropus boisei individual based on their shape and the manner of locomotion.</p>

<p>Three isolated footprints, ranging from 8-9.25 inches (20.5-23.5 cm) long and resembling those of modern people, were almost perpendicular to the main trackway. Two were complete enough to attribute to Homo erectus, possibly a juvenile. The third was harder to assign confidently.</p>

<p>The researchers said the trackways appear to have been left within hours or perhaps a couple of days - the mud had never dried and cracked - and the individuals even may have seen each other. There was no evidence of interaction.</p>

<p>"The fossil footprints provide us a clear picture of that instant in time, 1.5 million years ago. The different human ancestors may well have passed by each other, wading in the shallow water, possibly hunting and gathering," said paleoanthropologist Louise Leakey, director of the Koobi Fora Research Project and co-author of the study published on Thursday in the journal Science.</p>

<p>The researchers reanalyzed trackways that were previously discovered nearby, determining that both species were present together on fossilized muddy surfaces over a period spanning roughly 200,000 years.</p>

<p>"It is possible that they competed directly, but also possible that they were not in direct competition and both had access to the resources that they needed on this shared landscape," said paleoanthropologist and study lead author Kevin Hatala of Chatham University in Pittsburgh.</p>

<p>Dietary differences may have mitigated competition.</p>

<p>"Paranthropus boisei consumed low-quality forage that likely required repetitive chewing. Homo erectus was likely to be omnivorous, using tools to butcher carcasses, and also had meat in its diet," Leakey said.</p>

<p>The human and chimpanzee evolutionary lineages split roughly 7 million years ago in Africa. Species in the human lineage are called hominins.</p>

<p>Footprints provide information on anatomy, locomotion, behavior and environments that skeletal fossils or stone tools cannot. The feet of these two species were anatomically distinct, and they had different gaits.</p>

<p>"The tracks we attribute to Homo erectus have a very modern human-like shape with a tall arch of sediment in the middle of the track that indicates a stiff foot and a walking gait that includes pushing off of the toes," said Harvard University evolutionary biologist and study co-author Neil Roach.</p>

<p>"The Paranthropus tracks lack this tall arch and indicate a more flat-footed walk. Additionally, the Paranthropus tracks show a big toe that is a bit more diverged from the other toes and more mobile. Both of these aspects are more similar to the way a chimpanzee walks, although clearly distinct and intermediate between chimpanzee and human footprints," Roach said.</p>

<p>Paranthropus boisei disappeared a few hundred thousand years after these footprints, while Homo erectus flourished. Possibly a direct ancestor of Homo sapiens, Homo erectus was the first human species to spread beyond Africa.</p>

<p>The fossil site was a resource-rich lakeshore near the mouth of a river.</p>

<p>"The fact that we consistently see two species of hominins in these landscapes, in spite of the presence of dangerous animals such as hippos and crocodiles, suggests that these environments were important enough to our ancestors to be worth the risk of visiting," Roach said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Social media giants on Friday hit out at a landmark Australian law banning them from signing up under-16s, describing it as a rush job littered with "many unanswered questions".</p>

<p>The UN children's charity UNICEF Australia joined the fray, warning the law was no "silver bullet" against online harm and could push kids into "covert and unregulated" spaces online.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said the legislation may not be implemented perfectly -- much like existing age restrictions on alcohol -- but it was "the right thing to do".</p>

<p>The crackdown on sites like Facebook, Instagram and X, approved by parliament late Thursday, will lead to "better outcomes and less harm for young Australians", he told reporters.</p>

<p>Platforms have a "social responsibility" to make children's safety a priority, the prime minister said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We've got your back, is our message to Australian parents."</p>

<p>Social media firms that fail to comply with the law face fines of up to Aus$50 million (US$32.5 million).</p>

<p>TikTok said Friday it was "disappointed" in the law, accusing the government of ignoring mental health, online safety and youth experts who had opposed the ban.</p>

<p>"It's entirely likely the ban could see young people pushed to darker corners of the internet where no community guidelines, safety tools, or protections exist," a TikTok spokesperson said.</p>

<h3><strong>'Unanswered questions'</strong></h3>

<p>Tech companies said that despite the law's perceived shortcomings, they would engage with the government on shaping how it could be implemented in the next 12 months.</p>

<p>The legislation offers almost no details on how the rules will be enforced -- prompting concern among experts that it will simply be a symbolic, unenforceable piece of legislation.</p>

<p>Meta -- owner of Facebook and Instagram -- &nbsp;called for consultation on the rules to ensure a "technically feasible outcome that does not place an onerous burden on parents and teens".</p>

<p>But the company added it was concerned "about the process, which rushed the legislation through while failing to properly consider the evidence, what industry already does to ensure age-appropriate experiences, and the voices of young people".&nbsp;</p>

<p>A Snapchat spokesperson said the company had raised "serious concerns" about the law and that "many unanswered questions" remained about how it would work.</p>

<p>But the company said it would engage closely with government to develop an approach balancing "privacy, safety and practicality".&nbsp;</p>

<p>"As always, Snap will comply with any applicable laws and regulations in Australia," it said.</p>

<p>UNICEF Australia policy chief Katie Maskiell said young people need to be protected online but also need to be included in the digital world.</p>

<p>"This ban risks pushing children into increasingly covert and unregulated online spaces as well as preventing them from accessing aspects of the online world essential to their wellbeing," she said.</p>

<h3><strong>Global attention</strong></h3>

<p>One of the biggest issues will be privacy -- what age-verification information is used, how it is collected and by whom.</p>

<p>Social media companies remain adamant that age-verification should be the job of app stores, but the government believes tech platforms should be responsible.</p>

<p>Exemptions will likely be granted to some companies, such as WhatsApp and YouTube, which teenagers may need to use for recreation, school work or other reasons.</p>

<p>The legislation will be closely monitored by other countries, with many weighing whether to implement similar bans.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Lawmakers from Spain to Florida have proposed social media bans for young teens, although none of the measures have been implemented yet.</p>

<p>China has restricted access for minors since 2021, with under-14s not allowed to spend more than 40 minutes a day on Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok.</p>

<p>Online gaming time for children is also limited in China.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Boise State women's volleyball team have withdrawn from the Mountain West Conference tournament, alleging that their opponent, San Jose State University (SJSU), had a transgender athlete on their roster. The championship finals started on Wednesday (Nov 27) in Las Vegas as Boise State qualified for the semis after beating Utah State in the quarter-finals. However, the team refused to play against SJSU after a court ruling allowed Blaire Fleming, the transgender athlete in question, to compete in the tournament.</p>

<p>“The decision to not continue to play in the 2024 Mountain West Volleyball Championship tournament was not an easy one,” Boise State said in a statement.</p>

<p>“Our team overcame forfeitures to earn a spot in the tournament field and fought for the win over Utah State in the first round on Wednesday. They should not have to forgo this opportunity while waiting for a more thoughtful and better system that serves all athletes," it added.</p>

<p>Notably, it is not the first time when Boise State have forfeited their matches against SJSU. During the regular season, the team refused to play them on two occasions as other Mountain West teams such as Wyoming, Utah State and Nevada followed suit.</p>

<h3><strong>SJSU advance</strong></h3>

<p>Boise State's refusal to play means that SJSU have moved unopposed to the tournament final, scheduled to take place on Saturday where the winner of top-seeded Colorado State and No. 5 San Diego State will potentially square off against them.</p>

<p>Reacting to Boise State's stance, SJSU released a statement saying they were 'disappointed' with the decision but added that their team was preparing for the championship final.</p>

<p>“In this time of Thanksgiving, we are especially thankful for those who continue to engage in civil and respectful discourse. We celebrate and support all of our students, including our student-athletes as they compete for our community on this holiday weekend,” SJSU told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/28/sport/boise-state-mountain-west-volleyball-spt-intl/index.html" rel="noindex, nofollow"><em>CNN</em></a>.</p>

<p>Earlier this week, US District Judge S Kato Crews delivered a judgment allowing Ms Fleming to play in the tournament after several opposing players as well as Fleming's teammates filed a lawsuit against the team and the tournament organisers for allowing the transgender athlete to play in the women's tournament.</p>

<p>The plaintiffs claimed that university and conference officials violated their Title IX rights, which ensures that men and women are treated fairly in educational settings, including collegiate sports.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The World Health Organization on Thursday urged countries to step up surveillance for bird flu after the first case was detected in a child in the United States.</p>

<p>A small but growing number of H5N1 avian influenza infections have been detected in humans around the world in recent years, WHO epidemic and pandemic preparedness and prevention director Maria Van Kerkhove told a press conference.</p>

<p>"What we really need globally, in the US and abroad, is much stronger surveillance in animals: in wild birds, in poultry, in animals that are known to be susceptible to infection, which includes swine, which include dairy cattle, to better understand the circulation in these animals," she said.</p>

<p>H5N1 first emerged in 1996 but since 2020, the number of outbreaks in birds has grown exponentially, alongside an increase in the number of infected mammals.</p>

<p>The strain has led to the deaths of tens of millions of poultry, with wild birds and land and marine mammals also infected.</p>

<p>Human cases recorded in Europe and the United States since the virus surged have largely been mild.</p>

<p>In March, infections were detected in several dairy herds across the United States.</p>

<p>US health officials believe the risk for the general public is low -- albeit higher for those working directly with livestock animals including birds, dairy cattle and more.</p>

<p>Last Friday, US authorities said a child in California had become the first in the United States to test positive for bird flu infection. Health officials offered checks and preventive treatment to exposed contacts at the child's day-care centre.</p>

<p>The child had mild symptoms and was said to be recovering at home following treatment with flu antivirals.</p>

<p>"Including this most recent case, 55 human cases of H5 bird flu have now been reported in the United States during 2024, with 29 in California," the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.</p>

<p>Van Kerkhove said all but two of those had known exposure to infected animals.</p>

<p>"We have not seen evidence of human-to-human infection. But again, for each of these human detected cases, we want to see a very thorough investigation taking place," she said.</p>

<p>"We need much stronger efforts in terms of reducing the risk of infection between animals to new species and to humans," she added, notably through testing and proper protective equipment.</p>

<p>Van Kerkhove, who was the WHO's Covid-19 technical lead, stressed the importance of preparing "for when or if we will be in a situation where we are in a flu pandemic".</p>

<p>"We're not in that situation yet, but we do need more vigilance."</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Canada's antitrust regulator is taking Alphabet Inc.'s Google to court for alleged abuse of dominance in web advertising, adding to a mounting pile of legal challenges for the search giant.</p>

<p>Google illegally tied together advertising tools to maintain market supremacy and used this position to skew ad auctions by preferring its own tools, the Competition Bureau alleges.</p>

<p>The agency said Thursday it applied to the Competition Tribunal, a court-like independent body, for three forms of redress:</p>

<p>1. That Google sells two ad tools - publisher ad server DFP and ad exchange AdX</p>

<p>2. That Google pay a penalty worth three times the value of the benefit it derived, or 3% of global gross revenue if that number can't be "reasonably determined"</p>

<p>3. For Google to stop anti-competitive practices.</p>

<p>The case comes one week after the US Justice Department and a group of states proposed major changes to Google including a forced sale of its web browser, claiming it had illegally monopolized online search. Mountain View, California-based parent company Alphabet is one of the world's most valuable companies, with a market capitalization of about $2 trillion.</p>

<p>In an emailed statement, Google's Vice President of Global Ads Dan Taylor said the Canadian complaint ignores "intense competition where ad buyers and sellers have plenty of choice" and the company will make its case in court.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A similar probe into Google's ad practices is advancing in the UK.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Bird flu's spread among dairy cows, poultry, and humans has raised concerns about its adaptability.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A potential health risk has emerged in California after traces of the deadly avian influenza, commonly known as bird flu, were found in raw milk. The virus was detected during routine testing of cream-top, whole raw milk produced by Raw Farm LLC. In response, the company has voluntarily recalled the affected batch, which carries a "best by" date of November 27, following a request from state authorities.This discovery has heightened concerns among public health officials, particularly as the bird flu has shown an unusual spread among dairy cows across the United States this year.</p>

<p>This multistate outbreak of the flu, which is technically the Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza, was first reported in March in dairy cows. The rising frequency and diversity of mammalian infections in recent years have heightened concerns about the virus's adaptability and its potential for cross-species transmission.</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/OPA/Pages/NR24-039.aspx"><em>California Department of Public Health (CDPH)</em></a>, no illnesses associated with this lot of raw milk have been reported. Out of an abundance of caution, and due to the ongoing spread of bird flu in dairy cows, poultry, and sporadic human cases, consumers should not consume any of the affected raw milk. Customers should immediately return any remaining product to the retail point of purchase. CDPH is also notifying retailers to remove the affected raw milk from their shelves.</p>

<p>The County of Santa Clara Public Health Laboratory has been testing raw milk products from retail stores as a second line of consumer protection. The county identified bird flu in one sample of raw milk purchased at a retail outlet. The testing was then verified by the California Animal Health and Food Safety Laboratory System.</p>

<p><strong>Risks Associated with Raw Milk</strong></p>

<p>Public health experts have long warned consumers against consuming raw milk or raw milk products due to elevated risks of foodborne illness. Outbreaks due to Salmonella, Listeria monocytogenes, toxin producing E. coli, Brucella, Campylobacter, and many other bacteria have all been reported related to consuming raw dairy products. Raw milk products are not pasteurized, a heating process that kills bacteria and viruses such as bird flu.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pasteurized milk and milk products are safe to consume because the heating process kills pathogens, including bird flu, that can cause illness.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Australia's controversial new law barring under-16s from social media is one of the toughest crackdowns yet on platforms including Facebook and TikTok as governments worldwide grasp for ways to protect children from harmful content.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Australia's controversial new law barring under-16s from social media is one of the toughest crackdowns yet on platforms including Facebook and TikTok as governments worldwide grasp for ways to protect children from harmful content.</p>

<p>The blanket ban, passed late Thursday night, establishes some of the most stringent internet usage restrictions outside of China and other non-democratic regimes and could provide impetus to other governments to act. From Florida and Texas to France and the UK, authorities have attempted - or are considering - raising social-media age limits or tightening content oversight.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Lurking behind the debate, and driving the change, are the dark corners of social media that continue to extract a tragic toll. Like the 16-year-old boy, with a social media account filled with videos about hopelessness and death, who stepped in front of a train in Bayport, New York. Or the 15-year-old Australian schoolgirl who hanged herself from a tree at home in February 2022 after suffering years of social-media bullying.</p>

<p>While Australia's ban is wildly popular with voters - 77% support the move, according to a YouGov survey - it has unleashed a maelstrom of criticism from big tech. Major operators including Meta Platforms Inc. say the rules are ineffective or flawed, while X, owned by self-styled free speech absolutist Elon Musk, questioned whether the ban is lawful, heralding a possible court challenge. Academics worry about the unintended consequences of a blunt ban.</p>

<p>Under the new law, which will take effect in around 12 months, digital platforms including Snapchat, Instagram, and X will be responsible for enforcing the age limit, with penalties of as much as A$50 million ($32 million) for breaches. However, it's still unclear how the platforms will verify ages, with the government already ruling out the use of official documents, such as a passport, due to privacy concerns. Kids who find a way past verification controls won't be fined, and nor will their parents.</p>

<p>The law also threatens to upend the business model of some of the world's most valuable companies as they face a global backlash against problems blamed on their services, such as increasing mental health issues, online scams, lower academic performance and grooming. A successful ban would deprive them of a key user group - millions of teenagers who are coveted by advertisers and who the companies want to lock in at an early age.</p>

<p>In a statement, Meta said while it will respect the law, it was "concerned about the process which rushed the legislation through while failing to properly consider the evidence, what industry already does to ensure age-appropriate experiences, and the voices of young people."&nbsp;</p>

<p>The World Health Organization issued one of the clearest warnings in September after studying social-media use among almost 280,000 school-aged children in 44 countries and regions, one of the largest surveys of its kind. The WHO warned of far-reaching consequences for adolescent development and their long-term health stemming from the rise in problematic social-media use.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Geneva-based organization called for "immediate and sustained action."&nbsp;</p>

<p>This week's response from Australia, forcing through age thresholds irrespective of whether the child has parental permission, sets a new precedent.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We want Australian children to have a childhood," Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said as he introduced the legislation last week. Social media platforms usually require account holders to be at least 13 years old.</p>

<p>However, the simplicity of Australia's solution has instead highlighted the complexity of the problem.&nbsp;</p>

<p>YouTube, deemed by the Australian government to be a health- and education-related platform, is exempt from the ban, even though the comments section under videos can be as toxic as other corners of the internet. Online gaming and messaging services like WhatsApp and Discord are also exempt, even though they too can be used for bullying and grooming.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Subscribe to The Bloomberg Australia Podcast on Apple, Spotify, on YouTube, or wherever you listen.</p>

<p>One of the biggest weaknesses of a ban on young people is that it doesn't curb the production of harmful content, said Lisa Given, a professor of information sciences at RMIT University in Melbourne. She said platform owners should focus on disabling negative algorithms, which can overwhelm social-media users with content whether they like it or not. At the same time, there should be more investment in digital literacy for children and parents, Given said.</p>

<p>"This legislation is really ill-conceived," she said. "It's a simple proposed fix for something that's actually really complicated. And where did 16 come from? It seems like it was pulled out of the air."</p>

<p>Perhaps inevitably, almost all of the largest social-media companies including TikTok, X and Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, expressed concerns about the law in submissions to a truncated Senate inquiry before the bill passed.</p>

<p>TikTok, owned by China's ByteDance Ltd., said the legislation was "rushed" and "unworkable," and riddled with "unanswered questions and unresolved concerns."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Snapchat-owner Snap Inc. said previous international attempts at broad and mandatory age verification had failed. X, known as Twitter before it was bought by Musk, said it had "serious concerns as to the lawfulness of the bill."</p>

<p>Unicef, the United Nations agency for children, said Australia's ban would push young people into darker, unregulated places online. The law also risks compromising children's rights and severing their access to information that's vital to their welfare, Unicef said.</p>

<p>"Instead of banning children, we should hold social media companies accountable for providing age-appropriate, secure, and supportive online environments," Katie Maskiell, head of child rights policy and advocacy at Unicef Australia, said in a submission to the parliament.</p>

<p>Elected officials across the world tasked with overseeing social media find themselves in an uncomfortable squeeze. Many parents feel helpless and angry, and want children spending less time online. Their demands that governments step in are amplified by tragedies of youth suicides caused by social media bullying or sextortion. But it's difficult to isolate the obvious dangers of social media without destroying its benefits.</p>

<p>"It is impossible to be a teen in most parts of the world without social media," Stephen Scheeler, the former head of Facebook in Australia and New Zealand, said in an interview with Bloomberg Television. "Controlling that access from a parental point of view or government point of view is not as easy as it sounds."&nbsp;</p>

<p>A number of other nations and US states have attempted to curb children's access to social media, with limited success.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A Florida bill prohibiting children under 14 from having social media accounts has faced legal challenges, as have moves from states such as Arkansas and Ohio that would require minors to secure parental approval to use social media.</p>

<p>Norway wants to impose a minimum age of 15 on social media use after data showed many children under 13, the current age limit, still use popular platforms, the Guardian and other publications reported last month.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Even if Australia's ban proves hard or impossible to enforce, more countries are likely to take similar steps as concerns grow about the impact of social media on children, said Simon Kemp, founder of Singapore-based digital consulting firm Kepios Pte., which specializes in analyzing online behaviors.</p>

<p>"I would be very surprised if we don't see more of this," Kemp said.</p>

<p>France has renewed a push to keep under-15s off social media, Politico reported this week. French Education Minister Anne Genetet, a medical doctor by training, told Politico at a meeting of European Union education and youth ministers that the EU should follow Australia's example.</p>

<p>The UK's secretary of state for science and technology, Peter Kyle, has been in contact with the Australian government to learn more about its ban and its reasoning, according to the Guardian. Kyle has said he's not ruling out a ban in future, but any measures must be founded on evidence. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[US conservative political commentator Candace Owens has been denied entry to New Zealand for a scheduled speaking engagement, with immigration officials citing her ban from another country as the basis for the decision.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US conservative political commentator Candace Owens has been denied entry to New Zealand for a scheduled speaking engagement, with immigration officials citing her ban from another country as the basis for the decision. This follows Australia's recent rejection of her visa application over controversial comments. Known for her provocative commentary and inflammatory takes on social and political issues, Owens has built a significant following on social media, with over three million followers on YouTube.<br />
<br />
<strong>1) Early life and influences</strong><br />
<br />
According to a report in <a href="http://https://www.newyorker.com/news/annals-of-communications/the-gospel-of-candace-owens" rel="nofollow noindex">The New Yorker</a>, Candace Owens described her early years, spent in low-income housing in Stamford, Connecticut, as “dysfunctional.” At nine, her family moved in with her grandparents, where her grandfather, Robert Owens, became a guiding force in her life. Raised as one of 12 children on a sharecropping farm in North Carolina, Robert worked from the age of five, drying tobacco leaves and frequently shared stories of growing up Black in the Deep South, including harrowing encounters with the Ku Klux Klan. Owens has cited these family experiences to question liberal narratives about white nationalism in modern America. In a 2019 Judiciary Committee hearing on “the spread of white identity ideology,” she criticised Democrats for “fear-mongering” about racism, pointing to her grandfather's experiences under Democratic-led Jim Crow laws as evidence of the shifting political landscape of racial issues.<br />
<br />
<strong>2) Career</strong></p>

<p>Candace Owens, a right-wing political commentator, has drawn attention for her controversial views, including the promotion of antisemitic tropes and anti-Israel rhetoric. She has also propagated conspiracy theories targeting the LGBTQ+ community. Owens rose to prominence between 2016 and 2017 as a vocal supporter of Donald Trump's MAGA movement and a critic of the Black Lives Matter campaign. Her career saw significant growth during her time with Turning Point USA and later with the conservative media platform, The Daily Wire, co-founded by Ben Shapiro. But her tenure at The Daily Wire ended after increasing tensions with its founders over her remarks about Jews and her opposition to US military support for Israel.<br />
<br />
<strong>3) Recent controversies</strong></p>

<p>Candace Owens announced a speaking tour in August, 2024, promising audiences in Australia and New Zealand discussions on free speech and her Christian beliefs. But Australia banned her in October, with Immigration Minister Tony Burke stating that Owens “has the capacity to incite discord in almost every direction,” citing her controversial remarks about the Holocaust and Muslims. In New Zealand, officials denied her an entertainer's work permit based on a legal provision barring visas for individuals already excluded from another country.<br />
<br />
<strong>4) Connection with Kanye West and launch of ‘Blexit'</strong><br />
<br />
Candace Owens gained further visibility when Kanye West (known as Ye) once publicly endorsed her on X, stating, “I love the way Candace Owens thinks.” Following this, Owens joined West on a visit to the TMZ offices, where he made controversial comments about slavery being a “choice” for Black people. Building on the momentum, Owens launched the “Blexit” movement, short for “Black exit,” which encourages Black Americans to leave what she describes as the “Democrat plantation.”<br />
<br />
<strong>5) Personal life</strong><br />
<br />
Candace Owens is married to British businessman George Farmer, the son of Lord Michael Farmer, founder of the trading conglomerate Metal &amp; Commodity Company Ltd. The couple met in 2018 and Farmer proposed to her just 17 days after their first meeting during a FaceTime call on December 29, 2018, according to <a href="http://https://people.com/who-is-george-farmer-candace-owens-husband-8386561">People</a>. They married in 2019 and have since welcomed three children into their family.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A 44-year-old murder case has gotten hope for closure after two skeletal remains were found in a car submerged in a murky pond in the United States last week.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 44-year-old murder case may finally be solved after skeletal remains were found in a car submerged in a murky pond in the United States last week. The car is believed to belong to a couple that vanished way back in 1980.</p>

<p>Charles Romer, a retired oil company executive from Scarsdale, and his wife Catherine, were driving to the Westchester County suburb from their home in Florida in the spring of 1980. They made a stop at a Holiday Inn, now called the Royal Inn, in Georgia. However, they could not be found after that day even as the police found some of their unpacked belongings in the hotel, reported The New York Times.</p>

<p>The incident left their family searching for answers for decades, with the police suspecting that the couple may have been killed in a robbery as Ms Romer had a large amount of jewellery with her.</p>

<p>Now, nearly 44 years later, the finding of two sets of bones and a trove of jewellery, including a Rolex watch and diamond ring, from the submerged car has given hope that the cold case may have been solved.</p>

<p>According to Georgia police spokesperson Lawton Dodd, the human remains in the car "conclusively show the bodies of two people were in the vehicle".</p>

<p>It is yet to be ascertained whether the remains belong to the Romers.</p>

<p>The police have also found a license plate bearing the couple's initials, Ms Romer's granddaughter told The New York Times.</p>

<p>Investigators are also reportedly seeking a VIN number from the car to see if it matches the couple's 1979 Lincoln Continental - in which they were travelling the day they went missing.</p>

<p>Further investigation is underway to confirm that the remains belong to the Romers - who were in their second marriage, officials said.</p>

<p>"While the investigation will take months to complete, this development offers a resolution far better than the endless questions we've faced for so long," another granddaughter of Ms Romer told the New York Post.</p>

<p>The police have also found another car in the same pond, but it is reportedly not related to the Romers' missing case.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A massive gold deposit, potentially the world's largest, has been discovered in Hunan Province, Central China, containing an estimated 1,000 metric tonnes of high-quality ore.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A massive gold deposit in Central China is believed to contain 1,000 metric tonnes (1,100 US tonnes) of high-quality ore, according to the state media. The Geological Bureau of Hunan Province confirmed the discovery in Pingjiang County, located in the northeastern region of the province.</p>

<p>According to the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://english.news.cn/20241121/cc54468169bb4c8c9db21c08885dc2a5/c.html"><em>Chinese State Media</em></a>, with an estimated value of 600 billion yuan, which is approximately Rs 6,91,473 crore, this may well be the world's largest gold reserve, surpassing the 930 metric tonnes found in South Deep Mine, South Africa.</p>

<p>Preliminary explorations revealed 40 gold veins within a depth of 2 kilometres, holding about 300 metric tons of gold. Advanced 3D modelling suggests the presence of additional reserves at greater depths, possibly reaching 3 kilometres. This discovery has significant implications for China's gold industry, potentially boosting the nation's mining and economic capabilities.</p>

<p>"Many drilled rock cores showed visible gold," said Chen Rulin, an ore-prospecting expert at the bureau, adding that a tonne of ore in the 2,000-meter range contained a maximum of 138 grams of gold.</p>

<p>Liu Yongjun, vice head of the bureau, said that new ore prospecting technologies, such as 3D geological modeling, had been used at the Wangu gold field. Gold was also found during drills around the site's peripheral areas, unearthing promising prospects, Liu said.</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.mining-technology.com/features/feature-top-ten-biggest-gold-mines-south-africa/?cf-view"><em>Mining Technology, </em></a>the largest known gold reserves in the world prior to the discovery of the Chinese gold deposit include: &nbsp;</p>

<p>1. South Deep Gold Mine - South Africa &nbsp;<br />
2. Grasberg Gold Mine - Indonesia &nbsp;<br />
3. Olimpiada Gold Mine - Russia &nbsp;<br />
4. Lihir Gold Mine - Papua New Guinea &nbsp;<br />
5. Norte Abierto Gold Mine - Chile &nbsp;<br />
6. Carlin Trend Gold Mine - USA &nbsp;<br />
7. Boddington Gold Mine - Western Australia &nbsp;<br />
8. Mponeng Gold Mine - South Africa &nbsp;<br />
9. Pueblo Viejo Gold Mine - Dominican Republic &nbsp;<br />
10. Cortez Gold Mine - USA &nbsp;</p>

<p>These mines represent the most significant natural gold reserves identified worldwide to date.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Royal New Zealand Navy vessel ran aground and sank off the coast of Samoa last month as a result of human error, a government-initiated inquiry found on Friday.</p>

<p>HMNZS Manawanui, the navy's specialist dive and hydrographic vessel, grounded on a reef on the southern side of Samoa, on Oct. 5 while conducting survey operations. All 75 crew members on board survived.</p>

<p>"The direct cause of the grounding has been determined as a series of human errors which meant the ship's autopilot was not disengaged when it should have been," the head of New Zealand's Navy Rear Admiral Gavin Golding said in a statement on Friday.</p>

<p>The crew did not realise the ship remained in autopilot and consequently thought its failure to respond to direction changes was the result of a thruster control failure.</p>

<p>The reasons why the crew failed to notice the error would be part of a wider inquiry expected to be completed in the first quarter of next year, Golding said.</p>

<p>A separate disciplinary process into those involved would begin once that inquiry had concluded, he added.</p>

<p>New Zealand's Navy has been struggling with a lack of resources, three of its nine ships already idle due to personnel shortages before the sinking of the Manawanui.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NASA has captured a satellite image of red-hot lava oozing from Iceland's most recent volcanic eruption. The incredible shot, which also shows a large billow of smoke and gas arising from the eruption, has been snapped by OLI-2 (Operational Land Imager-2) on Landsat 9. The lava has flowed across major roads and closed in on the Blue Lagoon, a popular tourist destination, after erupting from a fissure in the Sundhunkur crater series on Iceland's Reykjanes Peninsula. This is the seventh instance of a volcanic eruption in the area in less than a year.</p>

<p>"This natural color scene [in the picture], acquired by the OLI-2 on November 24, is overlaid with an infrared signal to help distinguish the lava's heat signature," read a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/153630/lava-nears-icelands-blue-lagoon" rel="noindex, nofollow">statement </a>by NASA's Earth Observatory.</p>

<p>"A plume of gas, consisting primarily of sulfur dioxide, streamed from the lava, although the eruption did not affect flights to and from Iceland," it added.</p>

<p>According to the Icelandic Meteorological Office, the eruption's activity had not decreased as quickly as was seen in previous eruptions but had steadied in the last 24 hours.</p>

<p>"Eruptive activity has been steady over the last 24 hours, with lava now flowing predominantly east and southeast, towards and along the base of Fagradalsfjall," read an update, dated November 27.</p>

<p>"The lava field near Fagradalsfjall has expanded slightly but continues to thicken. Volcanic tremor has remained stable alongside eruptive activity in the vent. The rate of subsidence around Svartsengi has significantly reduced," it added.</p>

<h3><strong>What is a fissure eruption?</strong></h3>

<p>As per scientists, Iceland's current eruption is a fissure eruption. A fissure is a fracture through which a sheet of magma flows. When this fracture intersects with the surface, lava erupts onto the surface. According to a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/cq521pw0pgjo" rel="noindex, nofollow"><em>BBC </em></a>report, the Reykjanes Peninsula had been inactive for 800 years before volcanic activity resumed in 2021.</p>

<p>Volcanologists have warned that volcanic activity in Iceland had entered a new era. The country is home to 33 active volcanic systems, more than any other European country. It is located on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, a fault in the ocean floor that separates the Eurasian and North American tectonic plates and causes earthquakes and eruptions.</p>]]></content:encoded>

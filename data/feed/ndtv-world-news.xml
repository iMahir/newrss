       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has sent more than 70 animals, including an African lion, brown bears, and cockatoos, to Pyongyang, in a gesture showing the growing ties between Russia and North Korea. This unusual diplomatic move is a symbol of solidarity and a strengthening relationship between the two nations in recent months.<br />
<br />
The animals, including two yaks, were transferred from the Moscow Zoo to the Pyongyang Central Zoo by air, accompanied by a team of veterinarians. According to the Russian Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment, “This is a gift to Pyongyang from Vladimir Putin.”<br />
<br />
The move follows a series of events that highlight the deepening alliance between Russia and North Korea, including the deployment of North Korean troops to Russia in August, where they assisted Russian forces in the ongoing war against Ukraine.<br />
<br />
Speaking about the gift, Russian Minister of Natural Resources, Alexander Kozlov, said, “Cooperation between Russia and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is not only about economics, trade and industry. It is also a long list of nature conservation projects. Now, the friendship between the Moscow and Pyongyang Zoos has been added to them.”<br />
<br />
Apart from the yaks, the animals sent to North Korea included an African lion, two brown bears, five white cockatoos, 25 species of pheasants and 40 mandarin ducks, all of which were transferred to the Pyongyang Central Zoo.<br />
<br />
Svetlana Akulova, the General Director of Moscow Zoo, emphasised the animals' relocation is part of a broader effort to strengthen scientific and educational cooperation between the two nations “With the support of the Moscow government, we plan to expand cooperation with North Korean colleagues in matters related to joint scientific and educational activities, as well as the exchange of experience and information on caring for rare species of animals,” Akulova said<br />
<br />
This exchange is not the first of its kind. Earlier this year, in April, Russia sent over 40 animals, including eagles, parrots, and pythons, to the Pyongyang Zoo, according to a report in Russian news agency, TASS. In return, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un sent Putin two rare Pungsan hunting dogs in June 2024, ahead of the Russian President's planned visit to Pyongyang.<br />
<br />
In June, Russia and North Korea renewed a Cold War-era mutual defence pact, and according to the Pentagon, over 10,000 North Korean troops have been deployed to Russia's Kursk region, where fierce fighting with Ukrainian forces has been underway since August, reported <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/21/world/asia/putin-russia-north-korea-animals.html" rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">The New York Times</a>.<br />
<br />
North Korea continues to grapple with the severe effects of international sanctions, food shortages, and a humanitarian crisis exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic and natural disasters.<br />
<br />
The country's most pressing needs are far from just zoo animals. It faces significant challenges in acquiring essential resources such as foreign currency, oil and advanced weapons expertise critical to its military ambitions.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>King Charles III's coronation last year cost British taxpayers 72 million pounds ($90.7 million), official accounts released late Thursday revealed.</p>

<p>Critics have argued taxpayer spending on the events was too large and out of touch given the huge demands on stretched public funds and economising in recent years by many Britons.</p>

<p>The figures showed the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) spent 50.3 million pounds, while the interior ministry's costs for policing the "once-in-a-generation" event totalled 21.7million pounds.</p>

<p>Charles was formally crowned monarch at Westminster Abbey in a May 2023 ceremony attended by dignitaries from around the world.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A star-studded concert at Windsor Castle took place the following night.</p>

<p>The disclosure of the final bill, which had been estimated at more than 100 million pounds, is nonetheless set to spark fresh condemnation from anti-monarchists in the UK.</p>

<p>They have been stepping up their criticisms of the royal family and what they say are excessive and unfair financial benefits it receives in straitened times.</p>

<p>The country has been gripped by post-pandemic cost pressures, with decades-high inflation during much of last year, while flatlining economic growth has led to declining living standards.</p>

<p>Sceptics also note that the UK monarch, who receives more public money than European counterparts, is a multimillionaire able to foot more of the institution's bills.</p>

<p>More than half of Britons told pollsters YouGov before the coronation that the government should not be funding it.</p>

<p>The royals this month faced calls for more transparency and reform of their private estates, after an investigation alleged they have been profiting from public bodies while benefiting from major tax exemptions.</p>

<p>In its annual report and accounts, DCMS said it "successfully delivered on the central weekend of His Majesty King Charles III's Coronation, enjoyed by many millions both in the UK and across the globe".</p>

<p>DCMS was the lead government department working with the royal household on the coronation, which it described as a "once-in-a-generation moment".</p>

<p>It added the events "offered a unique opportunity to celebrate and strengthen our national identity and showcase the UK to the world".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President-elect Donald Trump is handing top roles in his future administration to a mix of allies, provocateurs, and a few relatively conventional figures.</p>

<p>Most positions require Senate approval, which brings added scrutiny.</p>

<p><strong>Here is who Trump has chosen so far:</strong></p>

<h3><strong>Health Secretary: RFK Jr.</strong></h3>

<p>Leading vaccine skeptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is the scion of the famous Democratic political dynasty and a conspiracy theorist.</p>

<p>The 70-year-old has promoted the disproven idea that childhood vaccines cause autism. He endorsed Trump after first seeking the Democratic nomination.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, TV celebrity Mehmet Oz, a former surgeon, will lead the United States' massive public health insurance programs in his first public office role.</p>

<h3><strong>Attorney General: Pam Bondi&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Pam Bondi, the former state attorney general of Florida from 2011-2019 and staunch Trump ally, is the president-elect's second pick to lead the US Department of Justice.</p>

<p>Bondi, who defended Trump during his first impeachment trial, was nominated after ex-congressman Matt Gaetz withdrew his name amid renewed attention to sexual misconduct allegations.</p>

<h3><strong>'Government Efficiency': Elon Musk</strong></h3>

<p>Tech tycoon Musk, the world's richest person, was tapped to lead a new Department of Government Efficiency, along with wealthy Trump ally Vivek Ramaswamy. Both will supposedly remain private citizens.</p>

<p>Musk says he is targeting $2 trillion in cuts from the federal government's $7 trillion budget, pledging to test legal boundaries to achieve it.</p>

<h3><strong>Secretary of State: Marco Rubio</strong></h3>

<p>Amid the intensifying US power struggle with China, Trump tapped Senator Rubio of Florida, a relatively traditional conservative hawk, as top diplomat.</p>

<p>Born to Cuban immigrants, Rubio is a fervent Israel supporter and longtime critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin.</p>

<h3><strong>Defense Secretary: Pete Hegseth</strong></h3>

<p>Fox News host and former soldier Hegseth was nominated to head the Pentagon, which employs some 2.9 million people, despite a slim CV.</p>

<p>He was investigated for an alleged 2017 sexual assault but no charges were filed.</p>

<h3><strong>Director of National Intelligence: Tulsi Gabbard&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Gabbard, a former Hawaii congresswoman, also switched sides from the Democrats to back Trump's reelection.</p>

<p>She has stood out for endorsing Kremlin justifications about its invasion of Ukraine, and controversially met in 2017 with Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad.</p>

<h3><strong>Homeland Security Secretary: Kristi Noem</strong></h3>

<p>South Dakota Governor Noem became famous for admitting she shot an "untrainable" pet dog, saying it showed her ability to make tough choices.</p>

<p>She would play a key role in Trump's promise to restrict immigration and deport undocumented migrants, along with hard-liners Tom Homan and Stephen Miller, who will be "border czar" and White House deputy chief of staff, respectively.</p>

<h3><strong>Education Secretary: Linda McMahon</strong></h3>

<p>Former wrestling executive Linda McMahon will head a department that Trump has pledged to abolish, vowing to "send education back to the states."</p>

<p>McMahon is a major Trump donor and led the Small Business Administration during his first term.</p>

<h3><strong>Interior Secretary: Doug Burgum</strong></h3>

<p>Burgum, North Dakota's governor, would lead a department that oversees federal lands and natural resources, with additional clout as head of a new National Energy Council aimed at expanding oil and gas production.</p>

<p>Climate group Evergreen Action warned that the billionaire could turn the Interior Department into a "tool for fossil fuel corporations."</p>

<h3><strong>Others</strong></h3>

<p><strong>Energy Secretary</strong>: Fracking magnate Chris Wright</p>

<p><strong>Commerce Secretary</strong>: Wall Street investor Howard Lutnick</p>

<p><strong>Transportation Secretary</strong>: Fox News host and ex-congressman Sean Duffy</p>

<p><strong>Veterans Affairs Secretary</strong>: Iraq war veteran and former congressman Doug Collins</p>

<p><strong>CIA Director</strong>: Former director of national intelligence John Ratcliffe</p>

<p><strong>National Security Advisor</strong>: China hawk Mike Waltz, an Army colonel and Florida congressman</p>

<p><strong>Environmental Protection Agency</strong>: Former New York congressman Lee Zeldin</p>

<p><strong>Federal Communications Commission Chair</strong>: Big Tech critic Brendan Carr</p>

<p><strong>UN Ambassador</strong>: New York congresswoman Elise Stefanik, a pro-Israel stalwart</p>

<p><strong>NATO Ambassador</strong>: Former acting attorney general Matthew Whitaker</p>

<p><strong>Ambassador to Israel</strong>: Ex-Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee</p>

<p><strong>White House Chief of Staff</strong>: Trump campaign manager Susie Wiles</p>

<p><strong>White House Press Secretary</strong>: Former Trump campaign spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 23-year-old student from India died after he accidentally misfired from his hunting gun while celerating his birthday in the United States. The incident took place on November 13, when the student, Aryan Reddy, celebrated his birthday with his friends at his home in Atlanta, a city in Georgia.</p>

<p>During the celebration, Reddy took out his newly bought hunting gun to clean it. However, he ended up accidentally firing a bullet which hit his chest, officials said.</p>

<p>Upon hearing the sound of the gunshot, Reddy's friends - who were sitting in another room - rushed to his room and found their friend in a pool of blood, officials said.</p>

<p>They immediately rushed him to a nearby hospital, but he was declared dead.</p>

<p>Reddy was a second-year student at Kansas State University, Atlanta, studying Master of Science. He hailed from Peddarao Palli village in Telangana's Bhuvanagiri district but his family currently resides in the Uppal district.</p>

<p>The victim's body will be flown to his hometown later tonight, the officials said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The festivities started with a celebration at EET, a Disney Springs restaurant offering Indian cuisine by celebrity chef Maneet Chauhan, followed by a 20-minute dance parade.<br />
<br />
The grand finale took place at Disney's Animal Kingdom Theme Park with a three-hour Dance Fest Showcase, featuring 17 dance schools and performances from regions across India, including Gujarat, Punjab, and Andhra Pradesh. The show included classical Indian dance, pop and hip-hop.<br />
<br />
LA-based Bhangra, Bollywood dance company B Funk and the SA Dance Company, led by artistic director Payal Kadakia Pujji, were the standout performers.<br />
<br />
Shoba Narayan, a former Broadway star known for her role as Princess Jasmine in Aladdin, hosted the event. “Diwali Dance Fest was an unforgettable celebration,” Ms Narayan told PTI.

       <description><![CDATA[As of the last update, Joe Rogan had changed his X (formerly Twitter) bio to, "Dragon Believer".]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Popular podcast show Joe Rogan has seemingly mocked ABC show, <em>The View's </em>co-host, Joy Behar, after she claimed that the former believed in 'dragons'. Ms Behar, featuring alongside Whoppie Goldberg, Sara Haines, Sunny Hostin and Alyssa Farah Griffin made the remark when the panel was discussing a poll, showing the number of young American voters who received their daily news from right-leaning political influencers and podcasters. Mr Rogan's endorsement of Donald Trump is believed to have inspired a swathe of young American voters to cast their ballot for the Republican leader in the just-concluded presidential election.</p>

<p>"I think that's why people like our show, because they know that we are checked by ABC News...We went from Walter Cronkite, basically, to this guy Joe Rogan, who believes in dragons. I checked it," said Ms Behar.</p>

<p>"And he also thinks that they, dragons-like, I guess, dinosaur-type of animals, roamed the Earth when people did. So this is a type of really, really bad information that's going out there. But it's possible Donald Trump did roam the Earth when dinosaurs were here," she added.</p>

<p>As the video of Ms Behar's monologue went viral, Mr Rogan quote posted it and said: "That's my new official X description."</p>

<p>At the time this article went live, Mr Rogan's bio/description on the X platform read: "Dragon Believer."</p>

<p></p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<h3><strong>Rogan goes on a spree</strong></h3>

<p>Mr Rogan fired another shot at the hosts of the ABC show when he shared a clip of his podcast interview with Frrest Galante -- a well-known adventurer. Sharing a YouTube link, Mr Rogan captioned it as saying, "Were dragons real animals?"</p>

<p>"It's so possible that something that flew like a pterodactyl, like we think of pterodactyls as being like bat wings, maybe they had feathers, maybe that a gigantic predatory bird and maybe some of those things looked like dragons," Rogan said in the video.</p>

<p>Afterwards, Mr Rogan went on a spree on his X timeline, posting a number of messages and links, strengthening his argument about dragons being real.</p>

<p>Earlier this week, Sunny Hostin was forced to read a legal disclaimer on air after alleging that former Attorney General nominee, Matt Gaetz had sex with a 17-year-old girl and was engaged in illegal sex trafficking.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Canada rolled back its standard operating procedures for extra screening of travellers flying to India, days after the move was implemented "out of abundance of caution".</p>

<p>The revised measures, that come amid souring ties between India and Canada, mandating that travellers to India will not be subject to extra screening.</p>

<p>Canada's Transport Minister Anita Anand on Monday, had earlier said that the "temporary additional security screening measures" may cause passengers some delays.</p>

<p>The back-and-forth comes at a time a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/hardeep-singh-nijjar-killing-justin-trudeau-doubles-down-on-charges-after-india-canada-diplomatic-showdown-6791322">diplomatic crisis plagues India-Canada ties</a> after Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau accused "agents" of Delhi of being involved" in the killing of Khalistani terrorist and Canadian citizen Hardeep Singh Nijjar killing in Vancouver in June last year. He claimed "credible information" had been shared with intelligence partners, including the US.</p>

<p>The Canadian government expelled Indian diplomats and in a tit-for-tat move, New Delhi expelled Canadian Charge d'Affaires Stewart Wheeler and five other diplomats.</p>

<p>"I think it is obvious the Government of India made a fundamental error in thinking they could engage in supporting criminal activity against Canadians, here on Canadian soil. Whether it be murders or extortion or other violent acts, it is absolutely unacceptable," Mr Trudeau said.</p>

<p>Nijjar - the mastermind behind banned terror outfit Khalistan Tiger Force - was on Delhi's list of 'most wanted' terrorists for multiple crimes, including the murder of Hindu priest in Punjab. Anti-terror agency NIA had offered a Rs 10 lakh reward for information leading to his capture.</p>

<p>On Thursday, External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said a Canadian report claiming Prime Minister Narendra Modi was aware of the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/smear-campaign-india-slams-canada-media-report-on-nijjar-murder-plot-7068353">plot to kill Sikh separatist</a> Hardeep Singh Nijjar was a "smear campaign". A day later, the Canadian government called the Globe and Mail report "<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/speculative-inaccurate-canada-factchecks-own-media-over-india-charges-7076955">speculative and inaccurate</a>".</p>

<p>"On October 14th, because of a significant and ongoing threat to public safety, the RCMP and officials took the extraordinary step of making public accusations of serious criminal activity in Canada perpetrated by agents of the Government of India. The Government of Canada has not stated, nor is it aware of the evidence, linking Prime Minister Modi, Minister Jaishankar, or NSA Doval to the serious criminal activity within Canada," the statement read.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Compare The Market recently shared data regarding the cost of obtaining a passport, which can vary anywhere between Rs 19,000 and Rs 1,500 in 2024.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A passport is one of the most important travel documents. Apart from verifying international travel, a passport also serves as proof of identification and nationality. Most governments issue their own passports which citizens can apply for - usually for a cost. This fee depends on the country and the validity period. Based on these fees, Compare The Market recently shared data regarding the cost of obtaining a passport, which can vary anywhere between Rs 19,000 and Rs 1,500 in 2024.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Interestingly, Mexico has the most expensive passports in the world. The fee for a 10-year passport in Mexico costs around Rs 19,464, per the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.comparethemarket.com.au/travel-insurance/features/cost-of-a-passport-2024/">report</a>. The country offers three kinds of passports, based on their validity, and they all appear on the top 10 most expensive passports list. Mexico's six-year passport is the fourth most expensive, while its three-year passport is the ninth most expensive.</p>

<p>Australia has the second-most expensive passport, costing around Rs 19,023 and valid for 10 years. It is followed by the United States, which costs Rs 13,899 and has the same validity period.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Other countries with affordable passports include Hungary, Spain, Kenya and South Africa.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Notably, according to the report, the Indian passport offers the best value in terms of 'cost per year'. This is mainly because of the validity period as well as the fact that Indian residents have visa-free access to 58 countries across the globe. The Indian passport has also been ranked 82nd in the Henley Powerful Passport Index 2024.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[The newly developed Steadfast helps differentiate between highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) and low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) strains.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Amid rising threats of bird flu killing hundreds of birds and also spilling over to some mammals and even humans, a global research team on Friday announced Steadfast -- an advanced diagnostic kit for detecting the highly pathogenic H5N1 Avian Influenza Virus (AIV).</p>

<p>This development marks a significant breakthrough in avian influenza monitoring, reinforcing global efforts in pandemic preparedness, said the team from Diagnostics Development Hub (DxD Hub) -- a national platform hosted by the Agency for Science, Technology, and Research (A-STAR), Singapore, in collaboration with researchers from Japan.</p>

<p>The newly developed Steadfast offers rapid detection of the highly pathogenic H5N1 bird flu virus. It also helps differentiate between highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) and low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) strains -- critical for effective control measures.</p>

<p>While conventional sequencing methods take two to three days for results, Steadfast can detect HPAI H5 strains (H5N1, H5N5, H5N6) in about three hours.</p>

<p>In the recent past, the highly pathogenic bird flu virus has caused mass mortality in chickens and wild birds worldwide. The infections also spread to seals, cats, cattle, and even from cattle to humans -- increasing the threat of a potential next pandemic virus.</p>

<p>Dr Onuma Manabu, Head of the National Institute for Environmental Studies (NIES), Biodiversity Resource Conservation Office in Japan said that these events show how rapidly the virus is mutating.</p>

<p>This stresses “the importance of establishing an effective surveillance system and developing faster detection methods that can promptly adapt to virus mutation to prevent the spread of infection,” Manabu said.</p>

<p>Manabu said the novel kit “meets this demand, and its widespread use” can help remove “public anxiety and allow for a more flexible response to the spread of infection”.</p>

<p>Detecting the virus and the strains early and rapidly is important as it can help monitor more migratory birds, provide timely warnings, and also reinforce biosecurity at poultry facilities, said the team. The timely responses can also significantly reduce transmission risks and help prevent potentially devastating epidemics.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President-elect Donald Trump has nominated <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/donald-trump-picks-pam-bondi-as-us-attorney-general-after-matt-gaetzs-withdrawal-7076412 ">Pam Bondi as the country's next attorney general</a>. The Thursday announcement came after firebrand Rep. Matt Gaetz's withdrawal from consideration amid allegations of sexual misconduct.</p>

<p>Ms Bondi, a vocal supporter of Trump during his impeachment defence and a prominent surrogate during the 2024 campaign, is set to lead the Justice Department with a budget of $45 billion and over 115,000 employees.<br />
<br />
<strong>Who is Pam Bondi?</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Pam Bondi practised law in Florida for over a decade, first as a prosecutor in Tampa and then as the state attorney general for eight years, earning a reputation as a media-savvy and effective litigator.</li>
	<li>She served as Florida's attorney general from 2011 to 2019, becoming the first woman to hold the position. She initiated litigation against opioid manufacturers.</li>
	<li>She has been involved in several high-profile cases. In 2012, Ms Bondi led an unsuccessful effort to overturn the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). In 2016, she faced criticism for defending Florida's ban on gay marriage, a stance that attracted significant attention, particularly after the Pulse nightclub shooting. She was also involved in a legal dispute over custody of a St Bernard dog, Master Tank, with a Louisiana family after Hurricane Katrina. Accused of stealing the dog, Ms Bondi countered with claims of neglect. The case was settled before trial, and Master Tank was returned to his original family.</li>
	<li>After leaving public office, Pam Bondi joined Ballard Partners, a lobbying firm with ties to Trump. Between 2019 and 2020, she represented Qatar, as disclosed in federal filings under the Foreign Agents Registration Act.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>A vocal Trump supporter, Ms Bondi played a significant role in defending him during his first impeachment as a senior adviser and lawyer. She has been heading the legal arm of the America First Policy Institute, a conservative think tank focused on advancing Trump's policies.&nbsp;</li>

       <description><![CDATA[Eli Feldstein, who served as Netanyahu's spokesman stands accused of transferring classified information with the intention of harming the state.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An aide of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been charged in a leaked document case. Eli Feldstein, who served as Netanyahu's spokesman, has been accused of transferring classified information with the intention of harming the state — an offence carrying a potential life sentence, according to <a href="http://www.timesofisrael.com/netanyahu-aide-idf-reservist-indicted-in-security-documents-leak-scandal/" rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">The Times of Israel</a>. He is also charged with the illegal possession of classified materials and obstructing justice.</p>

<p>The scandal also involves a second defendant, an IDF reservist non-commissioned officer (NCO), who has been indicted for transferring classified documents without authorisation. The person, whose identity has not been disclosed, faces a prison term of up to seven years. The person may further be charged with theft by an authorised person and obstruction of justice.</p>

<p>The charges are part of an ongoing investigation linked to a sensitive document leak in September 2024. The document, allegedly handed to the German tabloid Bild, contained information about Hamas' strategies and demands in hostage negotiations. Later, reports indicated it may have been written by lower-ranking Hamas officials and didn't represent the leadership's official stance.</p>

<p>The leak is said to have occurred when the NCO unlawfully extracted the document from the IDF's intelligence database and handed it to Feldstein, who is believed to have forwarded it to Bild.</p>

<p>The State Attorney's Office says it will push for the suspects to remain in custody throughout the legal proceedings. Feldstein has already spent over three weeks in custody, and recently, concerns for his well-being surfaced after reports suggested he was placed on suicide watch following a potential self-harm incident.</p>

<p>The IDF has noted that the disclosure of the document undermined efforts to negotiate the release of Israeli hostages held by Hamas in Gaza.</p>

<p>The court's information also showed that Feldstein's disclosure appeared to have been motivated by a desire to alleviate criticism and public pressure against Netanyahu after Hamas allegedly killed six hostages in late August.</p>

<p>The court suggested that Feldstein's decision to leak the document to Bild was intended to sway public opinion regarding the Israeli hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. The leak aimed to shift the blame onto Hamas leader Yehya Sinwar for the stalled negotiations and to portray the ongoing protests demanding the hostages' release as inadvertently supporting Hamas's agenda.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Musk posted a conspiracy theory alleging that DeGeneres had left the country as she was involved with Sean 'Diddy' Combs.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>SpaceX founder Elon Musk has taken a jibe at former talk show host, Ellen DeGeneres, after she alongside her wife, Portia de Rossi left the United States owing to Donald Trump's presidential election win. Mr Musk quote posted a conspiracy theory alleging that Ms DeGeneres had left the country as she was involved with Sean 'Diddy' Combs, who is currently in jail for his alleged 'freak-off' parties. The billionaire was referring to an original post made by Ms DeGeneres in 2016 when she wished happy birthday to P Diddy by calling him 'Cuddle McSnugglestuff'.</p>

<p>"Happy birthday, P Diddy, Puff Daddy, Sean Combs, or as I call him, Cuddle McSnugglestuff. You don't need to know why. @iamdiddy," read the post.</p>

<p>A user posted the screenshot of the said message and captioned it as saying, "That It makes sense why she fled the country after the election", which was amplified by Mr Musk who posted an 'eyebrow-raising' emoji without further elaboration.</p>

<p></p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p></p>

<p>One of the users under the Tesla CEO's post said: "If that is what she calls him - I wonder what he calls her. Actually - no no I don't - I really don't want to know," while another added: "Ellen literally fled the country before Donald Trump could release the Jeffrey Epstein client list."</p>

<p>A third commented: "Ellen DeGeneres is part of their club. Does she know that the UK has an extradition treaty with America? She can run but can't hide."</p>

<p>While Mr Musk mocked Ms&nbsp;DeGeneres, court documents have revealed that a fund linked to Diddy invested money to help the billionaire buy X (erstwhile Twitter) for $44 billion in 2022. However, he&nbsp;later expressed surprise at the extent of the allegations against him, stating on the platform, "I wonder how many people knew about this."</p>

<p>DeGeneres and her actress wife have moved to the Cotswolds in southwest England, after putting up their Montecito Estate in California for sale, according to reports. She had endorsed Democrat nominee Kamala Harris for the presidential job.</p>

<p>DeGeneres had a successful talk show programme that officially ended in 2022 after 19 seasons when several of her staff members, and even some guests accused her of promoting a toxic work environment.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A young UK lawyer has become the latest victim of a suspected methanol poisoning incident in Laos. Simone White, from Orpington, Kent, was among the five tourists who allegedly died after consuming drinks thought to have been spiked with methanol in the backpacker hub of Vang Vieng.</p>

<p><strong>Who was Simone White?</strong></p>

<p>Simone White, 28, was an associate lawyer who specialised in technology and intellectual property at Squire Patton Boggs, a law firm in London. Her work primarily focused on general commercial matters as well as both contentious and non-contentious intellectual property law, according to the firm's website.</p>

<p>According to her <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/simone-white-a9965a295/?originalSubdomain=uk" rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">LinkedIn profile</a>, Ms White had experience working across sectors. She also worked in the in-house legal team of a publicly listed global out-of-home advertising company.</p>

<p>Her employment history on LinkedIn shows that she's been associated with Squire Patton Boggs for over three years. She joined the firm as a trainee solicitor in August 2021, completing her two-year training period before she was promoted to associate in September 2023. Before this, she gained experience as a paralegal at Clear Channel Outdoor, working full-time from July 2019 to July 2020. Her connection with Squire Patton Boggs began earlier, during a one-month vacation scheme internship in July 2018, which further solidified her interest in the legal profession.</p>

<p>Ms White completed a fast-track LPC at BPP Law School between August 2020 and February 2021. Before that, she obtained her Bachelor of Laws (LLB) degree from Newcastle University in 2019.</p>

<p><strong>The incident in Laos</strong></p>

<p>Simone White was visiting Vang Vieng, a popular destination for backpackers travelling across south-east Asia. Reports suggest she and others consumed drinks containing methanol, a toxic substance often found in illegally produced alcohol.</p>

<p>She was taken to a hospital following the incident but did not survive. The Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office (FCDO) has confirmed it is supporting her family during this difficult time.</p>

<p>Methanol is a colourless liquid with a taste similar to regular alcohol, but even a small amount can be deadly if consumed.</p>

<p>Ms White's death comes amid a spate of similar fatalities in Vang Vieng. According to the <a href="http://https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx27wyrxz9yo" rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">BBC</a>, among the other victims are Bianca Jones, a 19-year-old Australian, two Danish women aged 19 and 20, and an American tourist.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Justin Trudeau-led Canadian government on Friday denied a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/smear-campaign-india-slams-canada-media-report-on-nijjar-murder-plot-7068353">report linking top Indian leaders</a> to criminal activities in Canada, saying it is "speculative and inaccurate".</p>

<p>In a statement days after a strong rebuttal from New Delhi, National security and intelligence advisor to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/india-canada-diplomatic-row-amid-india-canada-diplomatic-standoff-a-bombshell-from-justin-trudeau-6977740">Justin Trudeau</a>, Nathalie G Drouin, said the Canadian government is "not aware" of any evidence of the claims made by a Canadian media house citing unnamed officials.</p>

<p>"On October 14th, because of a significant and ongoing threat to public safety, the RCMP and officials took the extraordinary step of making public accusations of serious criminal activity in Canada perpetrated by agents of the Government of India. The Government of Canada has not stated, nor is it aware of the evidence, linking Prime Minister Modi, Minister Jaishankar, or NSA Doval to the serious criminal activity within Canada," the statement read.</p>

<p>The report by Canada's 'Globe and Mail' newspaper on Thursday quoted unnamed Canadian officials claiming that Indian leaders were "aware" of the plot to kill Sikh separatist Hardeep Singh Nijjar - who was killed in Vancouver last year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>India immediately responded sharply to what it called "ludicrous claims", with External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal calling the report a "smear campaign".</p>

<p>"Such ludicrous statements made to a newspaper purportedly by a Canadian government source should be dismissed with the contempt they deserve. Smear campaigns like this only further damage our already strained ties," Mr Jaiswal said.</p>

<p>In a parallel move, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/canada-rolls-back-extra-screening-for-fliers-to-india-days-after-announcing-it-7077302" target="_blank">Canada has rolled back </a>its decision to implement extra screening of travellers flying to India. Earlier this week, Canada's Transport Minister Anita Anand said that the measures were borne"out of an abundance of caution."</p>

<h3><strong>India-Canada diplomatic crisis after Nijjar's killing</strong></h3>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/india-canada-ties-hit-record-low-all-you-need-to-know-about-justin-trudeau-6811687">India-Canada diplomatic relations</a> have nosedived after Justin Trudeau raised allegations that Indian agents were involved in the killing of Nijjar, a Sikh separatist and the mastermind behind the banned terror outfit 'Khalistan Tiger Force'. The Canadian Prime Minister claimed he had "credible allegations" of India's hand in the Nijjar killing.</p>

<p>India has repeatedly trashed the allegations, accusing Mr Trudeau of pandering to Khalistani sympathisers for domestic political gains at a time his popularity with Canadian voters is at an all-time low. India has also termed the allegations "absurd" and "politically motivated".</p>

<p>Last month, the Canadian government linked Indian High Commissioner Sanjay Verma and some other diplomats to the killing. The Centre rejected the claims and pointed out that despite repeated requests for evidence, Canada had failed to share any substantive proof to substantiate its allegations.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[On WhatsApp, voice messages can now be transcribed into text "to help you keep up with conversations no matter what you're doing".]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Meta-owned WhatsApp has introduced a new feature called voice message transcripts and voice messages can now be transcribed into text, “to help you keep up with conversations no matter what you're doing”.</p>

<p>Transcripts are rolling out globally over the coming weeks with a few select languages to start, and the company plans to add more languages over the coming months.</p>

<p>In a blog post, WhatsApp said that sending a voice message makes connecting with friends and family even more personal.</p>

<p>“There's something special about hearing your loved one's voice even when you're far away. Though sometimes, you're on the move, in a loud place, or you receive a long voice message that you just can't stop and listen,” the social media company added.</p>

<p>For those moments, “we're excited to introduce voice message transcripts”. Transcripts are generated on your device so that no one else, not even WhatsApp, can hear or read your personal messages.</p>

<p>To start using this feature, go to Settings, Chats and then Voice message transcripts to easily turn transcriptions on or off and select your transcript language.</p>

<p>“You can transcribe a voice message by long pressing on the message and tapping on ‘transcribe'. We're excited to build on this experience and make it even better and more seamless,” said WhatsApp.</p>

<p>The Meta-owned company recently introduced the Message Drafts feature which addresses a common issue — forgetting to send an unfinished message.</p>

<p>When you start typing but don't hit “send,” WhatsApp now marks the chat with a clear “Draft” label and moves it to the top of your chat list. This ensures you can quickly locate and complete your messages without scrolling through multiple conversations, said the company.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The ICC's move accuses Netanyahu and former Israeli defence minister Yoav Gallant of war crimes in the ongoing Gaza conflict, a decision Netanyahu lambasted as "anti-Semitic" and reflective of a "modern-day Dreyfus trial."</p>

<p>"The anti-Semitic decision of the International Criminal Court is comparable to a modern-day Dreyfus trial - and it will end in the same way," Netanyahu declared, referring to the wrongful conviction of Alfred Dreyfus, a Jewish French army officer, in a landmark case that exposed deep anti-Semitism in late 19th-century France.</p>

<p>The Dreyfus Affair was one of the most controversial legal scandals of 19th-century France, marked by anti-Semitism and judicial corruption. Alfred Dreyfus, a French Jewish army captain, was wrongfully convicted of treason in 1894 based on fabricated evidence. Stripped of his rank in a humiliating public ceremony and exiled to Devil's Island, a former penal colony in french Guayana, Dreyfus's plight became a symbol of systemic injustice and anti-Semitism.</p>

<p>French authorities accused Dreyfus of leaking military secrets based on a scrap of handwriting vaguely resembling his own. The trial, fueled by rampant anti-Semitism, resulted in a conviction despite evidence pointing to another officer, Ferdinand Esterhazy, as the true culprit. The case divided France, with prominent intellectuals like Émile Zola denouncing the injustice in his famous open letter, J'accuse...!</p>

<p>The ICC has issued warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant over alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity in Gaza following Hamas's brutal October 7 attacks on Israel. These attacks, which left over 1,400 Israelis dead and led to the kidnapping of hundreds, triggered a massive Israeli military response, resulting in immense loss of life and devastation in Gaza. The warrants mark the first time an Israeli head of state has been targeted by the court.</p>

<p>Netanyahu rejected the ICC's actions as "absurd and false," accusing Chief Prosecutor Karim Khan of corruption and alleging the decision was an attempt to distract from accusations of sexual harassment against Khan - charges Khan has denied. Israeli President Isaac Herzog described the ICC's move as a "dark day for justice," while Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said the court had "lost all legitimacy."</p>

<p>Human rights group B'Tselem, however, welcomed the ICC's actions, urging international enforcement of the warrants. The group called the warrants "a critical step toward accountability for leaders responsible for crimes committed in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict."<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Speaking at an Indian community event in Georgetown, Guyana's President Mohamed Irfaan Ali praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his exemplary leadership and transformative impact on India's global stature.</p>

<p>Addressing the gathering, President Ali said, "...Prime Minister Narendra Modi, India is a shining light in your leadership. It is no secret that the strength of your leadership, the passion and compassion of your leadership and the deliberateness of your leadership have placed India in a different light and realm around the globe. You have brought incredible respect. But more importantly, you have brought a level of dignity and pride to India that is unmatched, and we congratulate you on that."</p>

<p>President Ali underscored India's growing influence in the world under PM Modi's leadership, noting, "Today, many developing countries and developed countries look to India for example, look to India for technology, look to India for research and development. That speaks volumes. It speaks about transformation. It speaks about a changed society and a society that is firmly rooted as a global leader, and we look forward to your continued leadership at a political level."</p>

<p>In a heartfelt acknowledgment of PM Modi's visit, President Ali expressed his gratitude for the time spent in Guyana, stating, "My dear friend and brother, PM Narendra Modi, we had you for more than two days, but still, people cannot have enough of you. It is all because of your hard work, humility, and the way you have led. This is not departure; this after today is saying, safe flight back home and we hope for your early return to our beautiful shores."</p>

<p>PM Modi's visit to Guyana, the first by an Indian Prime Minister in over five decades, marked the third and final leg of his three-nation tour.</p>

<p>During the historic visit, PM Modi co-chaired the 2nd India-CARICOM Summit alongside Caribbean leaders, further strengthening India's partnerships in the region.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Gary Gensler will step down as Wall Street's top regulator at the end of the Joe Biden administration, he said.</p>

<p>"Gensler has been coy about when he planned to leave the SEC but was expected to depart before President-elect Donald Trump is sworn into office. He will serve through noon on January 20, when Trump is set to become President," reported The Wall Street Journal on Thursday about the move.</p>

<p>"Gensler's decision to remain until the very end of the Biden administration probably disappoints some Republicans who wanted to see him leave sooner. It means he could try to push through some additional measures since Democrats will retain a majority on the five-member SEC as long as he stays," it noted.</p>

<p>Gensler presided over a hyperactive period in SEC rulemaking, Xinhua news agency reported.</p>

<p>Wall Street groups challenged many of the regulations he pushed through including a rule that would have imposed new transparency requirements on private equity managers.</p>

<p>A court also rejected a regulation that Gensler backed that tried to overhaul how companies do stock buybacks.</p>

<p>Gensler previously worked for Goldman Sachs and has led the Biden-Harris transition's Federal Reserve, Banking, and Securities Regulators agency review team.</p>

<p>Prior to his appointment, he was a professor of Practice of Global Economics and Management at the Sloan School of Management at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden called the International Criminal Court's arrest warrants for top Israeli leaders "outrageous" in a statement Thursday.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Whatever the ICC might imply, there is no equivalence -- none -- between Israel and Hamas," Biden said after the international tribunal issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former defense minister Yoav Gallant on suspicion of war crimes and crimes against humanity.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We will always stand with Israel against threats to its security," the president added.</p>

<p>In an earlier statement, the White House said it "fundamentally rejects" the calls for arrests.</p>

<p>"We remain deeply concerned by the prosecutor's rush to seek arrest warrants and the troubling process errors that led to this decision. The United States has been clear that the ICC does not have jurisdiction over this matter," a National Security Council spokesperson said.</p>

<p>The statement made no mention of an ICC arrest warrant also issued for Mohammed Deif, the military chief of Hamas.</p>

<p>Mike Waltz, the incoming national security advisor under US president-elect Donald Trump's administration, defended Israel and promised a "strong response to the antisemitic bias of the ICC &amp; UN come January."</p>

<p>"The ICC has no credibility and these allegations have been refuted by the US government," Waltz said on social media platform X.&nbsp;</p>

<p>His comments reflected a wider outrage among Republicans, with some calling for the US Senate to sanction the ICC, which counts 124 national members who are in theory obliged to arrest individuals subject to warrants.</p>

<p>Neither the United States nor Israel is a member of the ICC and both have rejected its jurisdiction.</p>

<p>The Hague-based court said Thursday that the warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant were issued "for crimes against humanity and war crimes committed from at least 8 October 2023 until at least 20 May 2024."</p>

<p>A warrant was also issued for Deif, whom Israel claimed was killed in an air strike in Gaza in July. Hamas has not confirmed his death.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[In the last 20 years, just a little more than 50 face transplants have been performed worldwide, which makes Mr Pfaff's operation a rare success.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A man in the US state of Michigan has become one of just several dozen people in the world to successfully receive a face transplant. Derek Pfaff, 30, attempted to kill himself but miraculously survived and now has a second crack at life, following a life-changing surgery. Mr Pfaff underwent the complex procedure that lasted more than 50 hours and involved at least 80 healthcare professionals at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester earlier this year, according to an announcement published.</p>

<p>In the last 20 years, just a little more than 50 face transplants have been performed worldwide, which makes Mr Pfaff's operation a rare success. Prior to the operation at Mayo Clinic, Mr Pfaff had undergone 58 reconstructive facial surgeries in 10 years but remained unable to eat solid food or speak casually with friends and family. Since he had no nose, Mr Pfaff could not wear glasses either.</p>

<p>"After my last surgery, the doctor told my parents that there's nothing more he could do except refer us to a place to get a face transplant. This surgery has transformed my life. I feel so much more confident," Mr Pfaff said in a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/video-dereks-story-just-another-face-in-the-crowd/" rel="noindex, nofollow">video </a>shared by the clinic.</p>

<p>"I'm also going to keep sharing my story with others to help as many people as I can. I lived for a reason. I want to help others. I am so grateful to my donor, his family and my care team at Mayo Clinic for giving me this second chance."</p>

<p>As per the doctors, approximately 85 per cent of Mr Pfaff's face has been reconstructed and replaced with donor tissue. Upper and lower eyelids, upper and lower jaws, teeth, nose, cheek structure and neck skin are some of the parts that have been reconstructed.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/distressed-uk-vet-dies-by-suicide-after-rich-clients-euthanise-their-pets-to-save-money-7054349" rel="noindex, nofollow"><strong>Also read | Distressed UK Vet Dies By Suicide After Rich Clients Euthanise Their Pets To Save Money</strong></a></p>

<h3><strong>Pfaff's suicide attempt</strong></h3>

<p>The son of Jerry and Lisa Pfaff, Mr Pfaff was a straight-A student and captain and star running back on the school's only state championship football team. However, on the fateful night of March 5, 2014, Mr Pfaff, then 19, decided to take his own life while at home during college spring break.</p>

<p>"I don't remember anything. I don't remember getting the gun, going outside, shooting myself or the weeks afterwards," said Mr Pfaff.</p>

<p>Shortly after 1:30 am, Mr Jerry found the family's gun cabinet open and soon found his son, lying on a snowbank, next to the garage. He was rushed to the hospital where he eventually regained consciousness.</p>

<p>"He does not remember getting the gun. He does not remember going outside. He does not remember shooting himself," said Ms Pfaff. "We met with the doctors, and they told us that there was no way Derek was going to make it."</p>

<p>But Derek did survive. "It's a miracle he lived," Ms Pfaff says.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Millions of Americans on Wednesday celebrated <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/78-year-old-donald-trump-oldest-person-to-be-elected-us-president-6957306#pfrom=home-ndtv_topscroll_Imagetopscroll" target="_blank">Donald Trump's remarkable return to the White House</a> - the 78-year-old defied pre-poll predictions to become the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/2024-us-elections-donald-trump-set-to-become-first-republican-to-win-popular-vote-in-20-years-6955598" target="_blank">first Republican in 20 years to win the popular vote</a> en route to the presidency. But not everyone was quite so happy.</p>

<p>Among his critics was Vanity Fair, a monthly magazine on popular culture and current affairs, which featured Mr Trump on the cover of its newest digital issue, with a sequence of numbers highlighting the legal disputes that still surround the President-elect.</p>

<p>At the top of the list is the&nbsp;<strong>34</strong>&nbsp;<strong>felony charges</strong> the incoming American President faced in a criminal case in the State of New York. The court ruled Mr Trump altered business records to hide over $400,000 in <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/he-should-be-adult-star-stormy-daniels-breaks-silence-on-donald-trumps-conviction-in-hush-money-trial-5802000" target="_blank">payments made to Stormy Daniels</a>, an adult film actor, to try and conceal details of their sexual encounter. He was convicted - the next number, <strong>1 conviction</strong> - on all counts in May.</p>

<p>Mr Trump - who slammed the entire case as a "witch hunt" and protested his innocence - is the first felon to be elected as President of the United States. He has said he will appeal the verdict.</p>

<p>Sentencing was delayed till after the result of this election; it will be held on November 26, while a separate hearing on immunity for the incoming President is expected on November 12.</p>

<p>If the latter hearing goes as Mr Trump will want - i.e., if the court rules he enjoys immunity as a former President - then the former will be dismissed, since the guilty verdict will be overturned.</p>

<p>Even if there is to be no immunity, Mr Trump can now surely postpone any sentencing, although he cannot, as President, pardon himself since this is a state and not federal case.</p>

<p>In the extremely unlikely case the sentencing goes through, Mr Trump could face a maximum of four years in prison, but sentencing a President-elect days before he takes oath (on January 20) would be unprecedented. Mr Trump has also asked for the case to move to a federal court.</p>

<p>The next number - <strong>2&nbsp;cases pending</strong>.</p>

<p>In the first pending case are four charges in a Washington, D.C. court accusing Donald Trump of spreading false claims of election fraud to try and block collection and certification of votes cast in the 2020 election. This is, perhaps, the big one, since it deals with the January 2021 attack on the Capital.</p>

<p>The attack - by a mob of Donald Trump's supporters - was widely seen as being precipitated by incendiary speeches from the outgoing President, claiming, as he had for weeks earlier without any evidence, that his election win had been "stolen by emboldened radical-left Democrats".</p>

<p><strong>FROM THE ARCHIVE |</strong> <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-capitol-violence-donald-trump-summoned-supporters-to-wild-protest-and-they-did-2348901" target="_blank">Trump Summoned Supporters To "Wild" Protest. They Came</a></p>

<p>The US Supreme Court offered some relief for Mr Trump after ruling some of his actions had immunity, but prosecutors then revised charges to name him as a private citizen instead.</p>

<p>Trump pleaded not guilty to all charges and cast the prosecutions as politically motivated.</p>

<p><strong>FROM THE ARCHIVE |&nbsp;</strong><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/donald-trump-calls-his-speech-before-us-capitol-siege-totally-appropriate-2351514" target="_blank">"Appropriate": Trump Defends Speech Before Capitol Violence</a></p>

<p>The trial date for this has not yet been set, and with Mr Trump's election win now, it is unclear if and when this will move forward. As President, Mr Trump can pardon himself for these charges.</p>

<h3><strong>The Georgia Case</strong></h3>

<p>In the second case, the President-elect and 18 others are accused of criminal conspiracy in trying to overturn his defeat in Georgia in 2020; he lost the state's 16 electoral votes to Democrat Joe Biden, but popular vote loss was less than 0.5 per cent - 49.47 to Mr Biden and 49.24 to Mr Trump.</p>

<p>The investigation hinges on a call Mr Trump allegedly made, asking a senior George polling official to "find 11,780 votes" - which would have put him a single vote ahead of his rival.</p>

<p>Mr Trump pleaded not guilty, but the trial itself has been delayed by his team seeking to disqualify the public prosecutor for a romantic relationship with a man she hired to work on the case.</p>

<p>Oral arguments on that matter are scheduled for December 5, but Mr Trump's lawyers are already looking ahead and have said they will ask the court for a suspension of proceedings based on the argument a President ought not to face a criminal prosecution while in office.</p>

<p>As with the New York case, Mr Trump cannot pardon himself as this is a state case, and he also cannot shut down these proceedings as he could the Washington, D.C. charges.</p>

<p>However, this case has also been paused with no certainty on when it will resume.</p>

<p>The other numbers on the Vanity Fair cover pertain to Mr Trump's <strong>2 impeachments</strong> - one in December 2019 on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, and the other in 2021, after the Capitol attack. In both cases Donald Trump was acquitted by the Senate.</p>

<p>The Vanity Fair cover also mentions Mr Trump's <strong>6 bankruptcy filings</strong>, and conclude on a sharply scathing note: "<strong>4 more years</strong>... the 47th American President."</p>

<p>But these numbers are trumped by another - 280, the number of electoral college votes in Mr Trump's pocket and which confirm that he will be the next President of the United States, despite a spirited (and hopeful) but ultimately futile challenge by Democrat Kamala Harris.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Far from Republican festivities as Donald Trump claimed US election victory, residents of a sleepy Indian village celebrated that their descendant would be the next "Second Lady", hoping to benefit from her success.</p>

<p>Academic highflyer and successful lawyer Usha Vance, the child of Indian immigrants, is the wife of Trump's running mate J.D. Vance.</p>

<p>While 38-year-old Usha Vance was born and brought up in suburban San Diego, those in the village of her paternal ancestors in India's southern Andhra Pradesh state prayed that historic ties would bring improvements to their land.</p>

<p>"We feel happy," said Srinivasa Raju, 53, a resident of Vadluru, a village of white-washed homes scattered amongst palm trees, more than 13,450 (8,360 miles) from the White House in Washington. "We support Trump."</p>

<p>Villagers had offered prayers for a Trump win, and Hindu priest Appaji said he hoped Usha Vance would do something in return.</p>

<p>"We expect her to help our village," the 43-year-old priest said, dressed in flowing saffron robes, after lighting a candle at the idol of Hindu elephant-headed deity Ganesh for Trump.</p>

<p>"If she can recognise her roots and do something good for this village, then that would be great."</p>

<p><strong>'Very fine'</strong></p>

<p>Usha Vance's great-grandfather moved out of Vadluru and her father Chilukuri Radhakrishnan -- a PhD holder -- was brought up in the Indian city of Chennai, before going on to study in the United States.</p>

<p>"Every Indian -- not just myself, every Indian -- we feel proud of Usha, because she is of Indian origin," said 70-year-old Venkata Ramanayy. "We hope she will develop our village."</p>

<p>She has never visited the village, but the priest said her father came around three years ago and checked on the temple's condition.</p>

<p>"We have already seen the governance of Trump -- very good," Ramanayy said. "Indian and American relations were very fine during the presidency of Trump."</p>

<p>Little is known about Radhakrishnan's initial years in the United States, but the film of J.D. Vance's memoirs, Hillbilly Elegy, refers to him coming to the country with "nothing".</p>

<p>Millions of Indians have made similar journeys as the Chilukuris, and according to the most recent US census, Indians have become the country's second-largest Asian ethnicity, growing 50 percent to 4.8 million in the decade to 2020.</p>

<p>Usha, a practising Hindu who studied at Yale and Cambridge Universities, married J.D. Vance in Kentucky in 2014. They have three children.</p>

<p><strong>'Inspiring'</strong></p>

<p>But the story was different around 730 kilometres (454 miles) to the southwest, in Thulasendrapuram, once home to Kamala Harris's grandfather.</p>

<p>T.S. Anbarasu, 63, said the Democrat's "struggle" had encouraged girls to stay in school.</p>

<p>"She is inspiring this village," he said. "Any school in the surrounding area, students know about Kamala Harris."</p>

<p>Harris, 60, was born in California, but was often taken to India by her mother.</p>

<p>"If she comes here, we'll treat her like the president of the United States," Anbarasu said.</p>

<p>"We are still proud of her. She is like family to us. If our family members fail, we don't discriminate against them, or treat them as a loser, right?"</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Popular Chinese influencer Kong Yufeng, known as "King Kong Liuke," has sparked health concerns by revealing her diet of pig feed, costing just 3 yuan (Rs 35) per day, to save money.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A popular Chinese social media influencer has ignited widespread health concerns after revealing she has been consuming a diet of pig feed to save money, according to <em>The South China Morning Post. </em>Kong Yufeng, known online as "King Kong Liuke," claims that the 3 yuan (Rs 35) per day diet is healthier than takeaway food.</p>

<p>Yufeng, a well-known handicraft influencer on Douyin with 2.8 million followers and a graduate of the Sichuan Fine Arts Institute, has revealed details of her peculiar diet on social media. Although some fans have praised her thrifty way of living, many others have voiced grave worries about the possible health hazards of eating pig feed, which is not meant for human consumption.</p>

<p>On October 30, Kong posted a video in which she expressed her intention to live on as little money as possible, although she did not disclose her reasons for this challenge. She adopted the top-ranked money-saving suggestion from Zhihu, a popular Chinese forum: eating pig feed, as per <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scmp.com/news/people-culture/trending-china/article/3285245/china-kol-adopts-pig-feed-diet-costing-40-us-cents-save-money-raising-health-concerns?module=top_story&amp;pgtype=section"><em>SCMP.</em></a></p>

<p>A diet like this could result in severe malnutrition and other health issues, according to health experts. They stress how crucial it is to have a well-balanced diet full of different nutrients in order to stay healthy.</p>

<p>Kong spent 100 yuan (US$14) on a bag of pig feed, which she described as having a "milky oatmeal smell" upon opening. The video revealed that the pig feed contains ingredients such as soybeans, peanuts, sesame, corn, and added vitamins.</p>

<p>"It's all high-protein, low-fat, and completely natural. Isn't this healthier than takeaway food?" she said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Adani Group Chairman Gautam Adani in a post on X congratulated Donald Trump for winning the race to the White House for a second time, calling the new US President an "embodiment of unbreakable tenacity".</p>

<p>Mr Trump won a sweeping victory in the US presidential election, defeating Kamala Harris in a stunning political comeback. World leaders swiftly pledged to work with Mr Trump, led by Israel and Ukraine <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-election-results-2024-what-donald-trump-said-about-wars-in-trump-2-0-victory-speech-6956202">where the course of wars</a> could depend on the new US President's isolationist "America First" foreign policy.</p>

<p>In his congratulatory post, Mr Adani said, "If there is one person on Earth who stands as the embodiment of unbreakable tenacity, unshakeable grit, relentless determination and the courage to stay true to his beliefs, it is Donald Trump."</p>

<p>"Fascinating to see America's democracy empower its people and uphold the nation's founding principles. Congratulations to the 47th POTUS-elect Donald Trump," Mr Adani said, referring to the President of the United States, or POTUS.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>The post is accompanied by a photo of Mr Trump with blood-stained ears following a failed assassination attempt by a sniper during a campaign stop. The photo which showed Mr Trump raising his fist in the air in a 'stay-strong' gesture as two Secret Service personnel tried to drag him away to safety had become one of the defining photos of the US election.</p>

<p>Mr Trump is the first president in more than a century to win a non-consecutive second term.</p>

<p>The campaign pointed to a nail-bitingly close contest, but the results came surprisingly fast, delivering a crushing victory that included wins in the swing states of Georgia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.</p>

<p>Gloom descended on Kamala Harris' campaign after she cut short a planned watch party and cancelled a speech.</p>

<p><strong>What Trump 2.0 Holds For India</strong></p>

<p>Earlier today, Congress leader Shashi Tharoor, who heads the Parliamentary Standing Committee on External Affairs, told NDTV Mr Trump is a familiar politician who India has engaged with before, and so the Trump 2.0 administration should not have any surprises for India.</p>

<p>In a short conversation with NDTV, the diplomat-turned-politician from Kerala explained briefly the areas that India already understands about Mr Trump's style of working, and how India can keep those in mind while engaging with him again.</p>

<p>"We know him very well. He has already been president for four years. I don't think there will be any surprise as to what kind of politics he will do. <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-election-results-2024-transactional-leader-no-surprises-shashi-tharoor-on-donald-trump-2-0-for-india-6956500">He's a transactional politician</a>, 'what can you do for me, and what can I do for you' type of leader," Mr Tharoor, the Congress MP from Thiruvananthapuram, told NDTV.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>More than a decade ago, a journalist called Kamala Harris "female Obama". However, the daughter of Indian and Jamaican immigrants failed to match the achievement of first African-American president Barack Obama.</p>

<p>The Democratic leader's defeat to her Republican rival Donald Trump in a bitterly contested election shattered her dream to become the first woman President of the US. But her nomination enthused women that this door in public life is not closed to them.</p>

<p>Harris, 60, has known other firsts, though. She has been the district attorney for San Francisco -- the first woman, first African-American and first Indian-origin person to be elected to the position.</p>

<p>As vice president, she is the first woman to hold the post. Also, she happens to be the first African-American or Indian-American person to make it there.</p>

<p>In an Op-ed published three days before the November 5 election, Harris recollected her frequent visit to India as a child and remembered her late mother, Shyamala Gopalan, a cancer researcher and civil rights activist.</p>

<p>"Growing up, my mother raised my sister and me to appreciate and honour our heritage. Nearly every other year, we would go to India for Diwali. We would spend time with our grandparents, our uncles, and our 'chitthis' (aunts)," Harris said in the article for The Juggernaut, an online South Asian publication.</p>

<p>She said she believes Americans want a president who works for all American people. "And that has been the story of my entire career," she said.</p>

<p>Harris got her big chance when President Joe Biden abandoned his own bid for reelection in July following his poor performance in a nationally televised debate with Trump. Biden endorsed Harris as the party nominee in the election.</p>

<p>Her nomination fulfilled her presidential dreams, which she abandoned before the primaries in 2019 due to a lack of funds to continue her campaign.</p>

<p>Biden picked her as his running mate in 2016. She was just the third woman to be picked as the vice president nominee on a major party ticket.</p>

<p>And she was one of only three Asian Americans in the Senate and the first Indian-American ever to serve in the chamber.</p>

<p>She has been likened to Barack Obama, the country's first Black President.</p>

<p>More than a decade ago, journalist Gwen Ifill called Harris "the female Barack Obama" on the "Late Show With David Letterman". Later, a small businessman from Willoughby, Tony Pinto, called her "a young, female version of the president".</p>

<p>She is considered close to Obama, who endorsed her in various elections, including that for the US Senate in 2016, Vice President in 2020 and the presidential election in 2024.</p>

<p>Harris was born to two immigrant parents: a Black father and an Indian mother. Her father, Donald Harris, is from Jamaica, and her mother, Shyamala Gopalan, migrated to the US from Chennai in 1958. She, however, defines herself simply as "American".</p>

<p>After her parents divorced, Harris was raised primarily by her Hindu mother. She says that her mother adopted Black culture and immersed her two daughters -- Kamala and her younger sister Maya -- in it. Harris grew up embracing her Indian culture but living a proudly African American life.</p>

<p>"My mother understood very well that she was raising two black daughters," she wrote in her autobiography 'The Truths We Hold'. "She knew that her adopted homeland would see Maya and me as black girls and she was determined to make sure we would grow into confident, proud black women." Harris was born in Oakland and grew up in Berkeley. She spent her high school years living in French-speaking Canada -- her mother was teaching at McGill University in Montreal.</p>

<p>"Harris was raised in a middle-class family by a working mother who taught her to believe in the promise of America. Her mother also taught her the value of hard work, bringing Kamala to her breast cancer research lab and showing her how to clean test tubes as a child," according to the Harris campaign website.</p>

<p>She attended college in the US, spending four years at Howard University, which she has described as among the most formative experiences of her life. After Howard, she went on to earn her law degree at the University of California, Hastings and began her career at the Alameda County District Attorney's Office.</p>

<p>She became the top prosecutor for San Francisco in 2003 before being elected the first woman and the first Black person to serve as California's attorney general in 2010, the top lawyer in America's most populous state.</p>

<p>In her nearly two terms in office as attorney general, Harris gained a reputation as one of the rising stars of the Democratic Party. In 2017, she was sworn into the US Senate, where she championed legislation to fight hunger, provide rent relief, improve maternal health care, expand access to capital for small businesses, revitalise America's infrastructure, and combat the climate crisis.</p>

<p>Harris is married to Douglas Emhoff, a lawyer, for the past 10 years. She is the stepmother of two children, Ella and Cole, who are her "endless source of love and pure joy." Her role as vice president was more than just symbolic. Unlike her predecessors, she wielded considerable power during Biden's presidency.</p>

<p>As president of the Senate, she set a new record for the most tie-breaking votes cast by a Vice President in history - surpassing one that had stood for nearly 200 years. And her votes have been consequential.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Portland International Airport is taking a unique approach to passenger comfort. Their newest employees aren't humans, but rather a herd of therapy llamas! These fluffy friends, provided by Mountain Peaks Therapy Llamas and Alpacas, wander the airport concourse, offering comfort and joy to stressed travellers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The llamas, dressed in adorable "I heart PDX" neckerchiefs, are part of a larger effort to create a more relaxing airport experience, alongside other calming features like natural light and live trees. These llamas are part of a non-profit run by Lori Gregory and Shannon Joy, a mother-daughter team that provides therapeutic visits with their five llamas and six alpacas. The duo brings their llamas to Portland's airport to offer comfort to anxious travellers, providing pets, head scratches, and occasional cuddles for those needing a bit of calm before their flights.</p>

<p>Dressed in "I heart PDX" neckerchiefs, cosy coats, and pompom headbands, these "fluffy professionals" wander through the airport terminal, offering a smile to everyone they meet. Alongside therapy dogs, the llamas are part of the airport's initiative "just to make you smile" and make air travel less stressful.</p>

<p>Therapy animals differ from service animals in that they don't perform specific tasks but provide a calming presence to those experiencing stress or anxiety. According to UMass Chan Medical School, these animals bring a sense of comfort that can alleviate some symptoms of anxiety and mental health challenges.</p>

<p>The llamas only visit the concourse for as long as is healthy for them. "It's just pure joy," says airport spokesperson Allison Ferre. "Travellers' faces say it best."</p>

<p>The llamas are part of a larger effort by the airport to create a peaceful environment, including a recent terminal redesign featuring natural light, live trees, and other soothing accents. "Being in nature is a stress reliever," Ferre told <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2024/11/03/nx-s1-5173755/therapy-animals-portland-airport-llama-alpaca" rel="nofollow, noindex">NPR</a></em>, explaining that the therapy animals are one way to enhance travellers' experiences.</p>

<p>Choosing the right therapy llama, however, isn't easy. Only about one in 15 llamas has the temperament and confidence needed to thrive in busy environments, says Shannon Joy.</p>

<p>These therapy llamas aren't the first animal companions to gain popularity in airports. Duke, a 14-year-old cat in San Francisco International Airport's "Wag Brigade," is one of the most famous. Duke made a splash on social media when he was seen wearing a tiny pilot's hat and shirt collar, joining the team to soothe anxious flyers. And in some cases, travelers have even brought their own emotional support animals on board, finding comfort in their presence during flights.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[At just 40 years old, JD Vance has become the third-youngest Vice-President in American history and the first millennial to ever appear on a major party's presidential ticket.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump has made an extraordinary political comeback, securing his victory as the 47th President of the United States, He defeated his Democratic opponent, Kamala Harris. This marks an extraordinary return for a former president who, just four years ago, refused to accept his election defeat, leading to the violent January 6, 2021, insurrection at the US Capitol.</p>

<p>With him comes to the White House Ohio Senator JD Vance, once an outspoken critic of Trump. The new Vice-President-elect's arrival also offers a preview of the direction the Grand Old Party (GOP) is headed ahead in 2028 Trump completes his second term.</p>

<p>At just 40 years old, Vance has become the third-youngest Vice-President in American history and the first millennial to ever appear on a major party's presidential ticket. His political journey, which culminates in his current role as Trump's running mate, provides an intriguing window into the evolving dynamics of the GOP.</p>

<h3><strong>Vance's shifting allegiance from detractor to Trump ally</strong></h3>

<p>Before aligning himself with Trump, Vance was a vocal critic of the former president. In 2016, as Trump prepared for his first presidential run, the senator questioned whether he was “America's Hitler” and later labelled him a “moral disaster.” At the time, Vance publicly condemned Trump as a “total fraud” indifferent to the struggles of ordinary Americans.</p>

<p>But Vance's stance shifted dramatically by 2020. Through several personal meetings at Mar-a-Lago and appearances on Fox News, Vance gradually embraced Trump's politics, culminating in his endorsement during the 2022 Ohio Senate race, which he won.</p>

<p>Vance was one of several Republican figures and potential vice-presidential candidates who publicly expressed their loyalty to Donald Trump by standing with him during his criminal trial related to the hush money case earlier this year in New York.</p>

<h3><strong>Vance's path to the vice presidency</strong></h3>

<p>Trump, known for his flair for drama, delayed his choice of Vice-President until after a highly publicised assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania. Two days following the incident, Trump reached out to Vance, offering him the position, and announced the decision on social media.</p>

<p>Supporters of Vance, including Trump's son Donald Trump Jr and media figure Tucker Carlson, said that Vance was the most loyal of the potential candidates, with a strong connection to Trump. His working-class background, growing up in a struggling Rust Belt town in Ohio, made him a powerful figure to attract crucial battleground voters. Vance's wife, Usha Vance, the daughter of Indian immigrants, was also seen as an added factor in appealing to minority voters.</p>

<h3><strong>Controversies and campaign challenges</strong></h3>

<p>Vance's selection has not been without its controversies. As a public figure, he has been known to make provocative statements -- some resurfaced during the campaign. In a 2021 podcast, he made inflammatory comments about the Democratic Party being led by “childless cat ladies,” which drew a lot of backlash from critics who accused him of promoting a misogynistic agenda. Vance attempted to clarify that the remarks were aimed at the Democratic Party's “anti-family” stance rather than an attack on individuals without children.</p>

<p>Further, controversy erupted when Vance repeated unverified claims about Haitian immigrants allegedly eating pets in Ohio. Despite the lack of evidence to support these claims, Vance defended his comment, saying it was necessary to draw attention to pressing issues such as immigration. “If I have to create stories so that the American media pays attention to the suffering of the American people, then that's what I'm going to do,” Vance had told CNN.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Wednesday congratulated US presidential election winner Donald Trump and urged continued close trans-Atlantic ties, telling him in English: "We're better off together".</p>

<p>"Together we can achieve much more than against each other," added the centre-left leader of Europe's biggest economy.</p>

<p>"Both sides benefit from the trans-Atlantic partnership," Scholz said in a statement to media. "The EU and the USA are two similarly large economic areas, linked by the closest economic relations in the world."</p>

<p>In an earlier message posted on X, Scholz said that "Germany and the USA have long been working together successfully to promote prosperity and freedom on both sides of the Atlantic.</p>

<p>"We will continue to do so for the benefit of our citizens."</p>

<p>The messages amounted to a pledge for a fresh start after Trump's last term in the White House, when he berated the NATO ally on what he deemed insufficient defence spending as well as on trade and other issues.</p>

<p>Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock, just back from a visit to war-torn Ukraine, said that "Germany will be a close, reliable ally for the future American government, that is what we are offering".</p>

<p>"As in any good partnership, where there are undoubtedly political differences, an honest and above all intensive exchange is more important than ever."</p>

<p>She said that during her visit to Ukraine as it continues to fight against Russian forces, "I have felt more clearly than ever before how much depends on Europeans and Americans standing up together for freedom, international law and democracy."</p>

<p>Concern has risen in Ukraine and across Europe as Trump has criticised the scale of US defence spending for Kyiv, and many fear his pledge to bring peace "in 24 hours" could amount to a deal on Moscow's terms.</p>

<p>Baerbock said a just peace "will only be possible with the Ukrainians, with the Europeans and with the USA".</p>

<p>"For me, for us, it is clear: We Europeans will now have to take on even more responsibility for security policy."</p>

<p>Norbert Roettgen, a veteran foreign policy expert from the conservative German opposition party CDU, described Trump's victory in less diplomatic terms.</p>

<p>"Trump is unpredictable," he told the Rheinische Post daily. "If there were further support for Ukraine under him, that would be a surprise. He believes that the Europeans should do it themselves, and this position is popular in the USA."</p>

<p>He predicted a "period of stress in trans-Atlantic relations" and said it would be up to Europe "to do our part much more quickly and comprehensively for the trans-Atlantic partnership."</p>

<p>One of the first German politicians to congratulate Trump was Alice Weidel of the far-right Alternative for Germany, who wrote on X early Wednesday: "Congratulations to Donald J. Trump on becoming the 47th President of the United States!"</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump on Wednesday won the US presidential election over Kamala Harris, and world leaders were swift in congratulating the Republican.</p>

<p>Donald Trump vowed strict trade measures against China on the campaign trail for the White House, and the relationship between Washington and Beijing will be one of the key themes of his tenure.</p>

<p>Here is a selection of comments made by Trump about China:</p>

<p>-- "The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make US manufacturing non-competitive," Trump tweeted in November 2012.</p>

<p>-- "I beat the people from China. I win against China. You can win against China if you're smart. But our people don't have a clue. We give state dinners to the heads of China. I said, 'why are you doing state dinners for them? They're ripping us left and right. Just take them to McDonald's and go back to the negotiating table," Trump said at a July 2015 rally.</p>

<p>-- "We can't continue to allow China to rape our country, and that's what we're doing," Trump told a campaign rally in May 2016, insisting that the United States had "a lot of power with China."</p>

<p>-- "China is letting us down in that they have not been buying the agricultural products from our great Farmers that they said they would," Trump tweeted in July 2019.</p>

<p>-- "For the people that are now out of work because of the important and necessary containment policies, for instance the shutting down of hotels, bars and restaurants, money will soon be coming to you. The onslaught of the Chinese Virus is not your fault! Will be stronger than ever!" he wrote in a tweet in March 2020.</p>

<p>-- "China's pattern of misconduct is well known. For decades, they have ripped off the United States like no one has ever done before. Hundreds of billions of dollars a year were lost dealing with China, especially over the years during the prior administration," he said in May 2020.</p>

<p>-- "As we pursue this bright future, we must hold accountable the nation which unleashed this plague onto the world: China," Trump told the United Nations in September 2020, referring to the coronavirus pandemic.</p>

<p>-- "Think of President Xi: central casting, a brilliant guy. You know, when I say he's brilliant, everyone says, 'Oh that's terrible'... Well, he runs 1.4 billion people with an iron fist. Smart, brilliant, everything perfect. There's nobody in Hollywood like this guy," he said in July 2023 at a Fox News town hall.</p>

<p>-- "I had a very strong relationship with him," Trump said of President Xi to the Wall Street Journal in October 2024. "He was actually a really good, I don't want to say friend -- I don't want to act foolish, 'he was my friend' -- but I got along with him great."</p>

<p>Trump added: "He's a very fierce person."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For the second time in eight years, a woman has won the Democratic nomination for US president, only to come up short in a campaign where gender was a central issue.</p>

<p>Like Hillary Clinton in 2016, Kamala Harris had a shot at becoming the first woman to occupy the Oval Office but stumbled at the final hurdle.</p>

<p>While the charisma of their opponent -- Donald Trump, in both cases -- clearly played a role in these historic defeats, many observers also saw misogyny as a factor.</p>

<p>In their dueling campaigns, Harris and Trump laid out starkly different visions for women's status and rights.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/world-leaders-pledge-to-work-with-trump-as-he-claims-us-election-in-6957090">Trump</a>, who has faced multiple accusations of sexual assault he denies, sought to broadcast a hypermasculine image, appearing alongside mixed martial artists and offering praise for autocratic world leaders.</p>

<p>He and his campaign surrogates also made multiple comments that were criticized as insulting or contemptuous of women.</p>

<p>He called<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-election-results-2024-people-from-kamala-harris-indian-ancestral-village-in-tamil-nadu-express-disappointment-6957062"> Harris</a> "crazy" and "mentally disabled", and claimed she would be "like a play toy" for other world leaders if elected.</p>

<p>His running mate, Ohio Senator J.D. Vance, doubled down on a quip he made in 2021 about "childless cat ladies" running the country, saying "I've got nothing against cats."</p>

<p>Trump also presented himself as a "protector" of women, saying he would protect them whether they "like it or not."</p>

<h3><strong>Defender of women's rights</strong></h3>

<p>Harris by contrast relied heavily on female celebrities such as Beyonce, Jennifer Lopez, Lady Gaga and Oprah Winfrey, betting that they would help her reach even conservative women voters.</p>

<p>Harris did not campaign openly on the fact that she would have been the first female president of the United States.</p>

<p>But she made the defense of women's rights, and abortion in particular, one of the cornerstones of her campaign.</p>

<p>But this appears not to have won over enough moderately conservative women.</p>

<p>At a campaign rally last month, former first lady Michelle Obama denounced the apparent double standard by which the two White House candidates were judged.</p>

<p>"We expect her to be intelligent and articulate, to have a clear set of policies, to never show too much anger, to prove time and time again that she belongs," she said of Harris.</p>

<p>"But for Trump, we expect nothing at all. No understanding of policy, no ability to put together a coherent argument, no honesty, no decency, no morals."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At the Palm Beach County Convention Center in Florida, it was midnight when Donald Trump and his entourage appeared on stage to a resounding applause from a crowd eagerly waiting to catch a glimpse of their President-elect. Moments into his victory speech on Tuesday, Trump lauded his running mate JD Vance and his Indian-American wife, Usha Chilukuri Vance.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-election-results-live-now-i-can-say-vice-president-donald-trumps-shoutout-to-jd-vance-his-wife-6955555 ">Trump defeated Democratic rival Kamala Harris</a> by a margin of 53 electoral votes. “I want to be the first to congratulate - now I can say Vice President-elect JD Vance. And his remarkable and beautiful wife, Usha Vance,” Trump said, drawing loud cheers from the audience.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<strong>Who is Usha Vance?</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Born to Indian parents who emigrated from Andhra Pradesh to the US in 1986, <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/meet-india-origin-usha-chilukuri-vance-wife-of-trumps-vice-president-pick-6114615">Usha Chilukuri Vance</a> was raised in a suburb of San Diego, California.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>She earned a bachelor's degree in History from Yale University and went on to complete a Master of Philosophy at the University of Cambridge as a Gates Scholar.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>The would-be Second Lady of the United States also held editorial roles at the Yale Journal of Law &amp; Technology and The Yale Law Journal, where she served as Managing Editor and Executive Development Editor, respectively.</li>
	<li>Usha met JD Vance at Yale Law School and got married in 2014 in a ceremony that included a Hindu ritual. Together, they have three children. Throughout JD Vance's political career, Usha has been a supportive partner, often appearing alongside him during his Ohio Senate campaign. Her insights also contributed to JD Vance's well-known memoir, Hillbilly Elegy, which sheds light on the struggles of rural America and was later adapted into a movie directed by Ron Howard.</li>
	<li>She works as a corporate litigator at a&nbsp;firm in San Francisco. Her legal career also includes clerking for US Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh.</li>

       <description><![CDATA[Donald Trump touted his ability to "get away with it" as a defining theme of his life story when he first ran for president in 2016 -- boasting that he could shoot someone on New York's Fifth Avenue without losing a single vote.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump touted his ability to "get away with it" as a defining theme of his life story when he first ran for president in 2016 -- boasting that he could shoot someone on New York's Fifth Avenue without losing a single vote.</p>

<p>Fast-forward eight years and America's incoming 47th president looks like Nostradamus, winning the keys to the White House on Wednesday despite incredible odds.</p>

<p>He is the most controversial man in the country, narrowly avoided being killed in an assassination attempt, and at 78 will become the oldest person to take the Oval Office in US history.</p>

<p>And that's before throwing in the fact that he's out on bail in three criminal jurisdictions and fighting gigantic civil penalties for sexual assault and fraud. Despite victory, he faces sentencing in just a few weeks on nearly three-dozen felonies related to his 2016 presidential campaign.</p>

<p>Yet in defeating Democrat Kamala Harris, Trump has once more shown he can defy all political and legal gravity.</p>

<p>Many thought this time he wouldn't manage.</p>

<p>He'd closed out November of last year with a 47.4 percent average in opinion polls -- a number that only shifted by one point upward in the intervening year.</p>

<p>Far from moving to the center, he continued to publicly praise foreign dictators, while threatening fellow Americans with military reprisals. He re-upped his once unprecedented, now trademark, claims that Democrats were trying to rig the election against him.</p>

<p>Trump's longest-serving chief-of-staff called him a "fascist."</p>

<p>For most candidates, any of these controversies, let alone the legal issues, would have been career-ending.</p>

<p>Yet for Trump, controversy is all part of the show.</p>

<p>Even an assassination attempt at a Pennsylvania rally that left him bloodied could not keep down the man whose self-branded persona as the ultimate deal-maker has embedded itself in the American psyche.</p>

<p>Now, Trump is about to be reinstalled as the commander in chief of the most powerful military in history, despite a criminal record that would bar him from serving as a private in the army.</p>

<p>And his legal troubles could disappear as the new president -- emboldened by presidential immunity from prosecution -- issues pardons, fires federal prosecutors and gets backing from a Supreme Court dominated by his allies.</p>

<p><strong>'Enemy from within'</strong></p>

<p>Born wealthy and growing up as a playboy real estate entrepreneur, Trump astonished the world by winning the presidency on a hard-right platform in 2016 against Democratic heavyweight Hillary Clinton.</p>

<p>The Republican's first term began with a dark inaugural address evoking "American carnage."</p>

<p>It ended in mayhem when he refused to accept his defeat by Joe Biden, then rallied supporters before they rushed into Congress on January 6, 2021.</p>

<p>In office, Trump upended every tradition, ranging from the trivial (what got planted in the Rose Garden) to the fundamental (relations with NATO).</p>

<p>Journalists became the "enemy of the people" -- a phrase he would later tweak to the "enemy from within" as he called for reprisals against all political opponents.</p>

<p>On the world stage, Trump turned US alliances into transactions as friendly partners like South Korea and Germany were accused of trying to "rip us off."</p>

<p>By contrast, he repeatedly praised -- and continues to praise -- the likes of Russian President Vladimir Putin, China's Xi Jinping and North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un.</p>

<p>Throughout, he increasingly dominated the Republican Party, which dropped all opposition and ended up winning him acquittal in two impeachment proceedings.</p>

<p>That loyalty to Trump only deepened after he left the White House, with senior Republicans regularly trooping to see him at his palatial Florida residence and in the dingy Manhattan courthouse where he was tried for fraud this year.</p>

<p><strong>Autocratic drift</strong></p>

<p>Before he rode down the golden escalator of Trump Tower in New York to announce his 2016 White House bid, Trump was best known as a TV personality.</p>

<p>He was famous mostly for the ruthless character he played on reality show "The Apprentice," as well as for developing luxury buildings and golf resorts, and for his wife Melania, a former fashion model.</p>

<p>The political rise was meteoric. But academics have noted parallels between his evolution and those of autocrats in countries where democratic institutions exist only as facades, allowing populist strongmen to take power.</p>

<p>Millions were thrilled by his attacks on politics, his coarse language, his promises to expel illegal immigrants, and the gaudy glamour that he brought to blue-collar Americans beaten down by globalization and deindustrialization.</p>

<p>At the same time, more than half the country agrees with Trump's top White House aide John Kelly that the tycoon is a fascist, according to a recent ABC poll.</p>

<p>In office, he relished the daily controversy, joking about changing the US Constitution to stay in power indefinitely. As he campaigned to return to power in 2024, he again called for termination of the founding document.</p>

<p>Trump's allies dismiss such talk as mere rhetoric.</p>

<p>But Trump broke all precedent when he refused to concede his 2020 loss, ultimately unleashing a mob on the US Capitol, while his vice president, Mike Pence, went into hiding.</p>

<p>Unprecedented -- but forgiven by just enough US voters to allow the showman to get away with it again.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump's victory speech included a shout-out to Robert F. Kennedy Junior, hinting at a major role for him in the Trump Administration once it is set up, provided he doesn't interfere with America's oil exploration and drilling.</p>

<p>"Bobby, stay away from the liquid gold, Bobby. Other than that, go have a good time," Trump said while acknowledging people who have supported him and been part of his campaign.</p>

<p>Robert F. Kennedy Junior or RFK, fondly called Bobby, as Robert's are commonly referred to, is a politician, lawyer and activist. He has been a strong voice for environmental activism, which is why Donald Trump told him to "stay away from the liquid gold (oil)".</p>

<p>"He wants to do some things and we're going to let him go to it," Donald Trump said, adding that he will help "Make America Healthy Again". Though Trump hasn't specified or declared a portfolio for Mr Kennedy, it is likely that he might be made in-charge of Health. Mr Kennedy too led his campaign with the slogan 'Make America Healthy Again' - a slogan that found mention in Trump's victory speech.</p>

<p>It would still come as a surprise to many if an outspoken 'anti-vaxxer' is made in-charge of Health for all Americans. Mr Kennedy has been promoting vastly hollow and scientifically false ideas about what he claims are the dangers of taking vaccines. He has been propagating fluoride in drinking water.</p>

<p>A member of the Kennedy family, Robert F. Kennedy Jr is a scion of America's storied political clan. He is the son of US's former attorney general and senator Robert F. Kennedy, and a nephew of ex-US President John F. Kennedy as well as former Senator Ted Kennedy.</p>

<p>He was originally standing for election as an Independent candidate and was polling at four to five per cent nationally. In late August, however, he decided to pull out of the race and endorse Donald Trump. He then campaigned with Trump across the battleground states to garner support for him.</p>

<p>Kennedy Jr is a controversial politician as he has been an anti-vaccine activist, as well as a conspiracy theorist. His anti-vaccine advocacy group Children's Health Defense has been a leading proponent of the COVID-19 vaccine misinformation.</p>

<p>Donald Trump also hinted at a role in his administration to billionaire Elon Musk.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Although Kamala Harris has been defeated by Donald Trump in the US presidential election, she will make a comeback as she is a fighter, said residents of Thulasendrapuram, the village of her maternal ancestors, on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Since morning, locals were glued to television screens, monitoring election results, and many checked trends on media websites. Several residents also visited the Sri Dharma Sastha Perumal temple to pray for Harris's victory.</p>

<p>However, as the day progressed, it became pretty clear that it was Donald Trump who was leading and when he eventually defeated his Democratic rival Kamala Harris, Thulasendrapuram village, which teemed with local and outside people, gradually became deserted and returned to its usual state of quietude. Two Americans and a citizen of the UK, fans of Harris, who had landed in the village the day before left the place.</p>

<p>J Sudhakar, DMK Tiruvarur district representative and Thulasendrapuram village leader, told PTI, "We were hoping for her victory and had planned celebrations bigger than Deepavali. We made arrangements to burst firecrackers, distribute sweets, offer temple pujas, and host a community lunch." "But success and failure are part of life. It was a tough fight, and you must admire her fighting spirit. She is a fighter and will make a comeback," he added.</p>

<p>Other villagers shared similar sentiments, expressing confidence that Harris would continue her journey as a fighter and someday become the US president, even if it didn't happen this time.</p>

<p>Village resident and retired ONGC employee T S Anbasarasu said, "We cannot digest the fact that she has lost, but the saving grace is she is only 60 year old and we expect her to win the next election. But Trump is 78. We are confident she will not get bogged down by this loss and will continue her work." Furthermore, Anbarasu said, "Definitely we hope she will visit our village after getting elected in future...we expected her to visit our village a few years back and had sent messages to her relatives too...our village has become a tourist spot because of her." Sudhakar noted that everyone in the village had hoped Harris, whose maternal ancestors hailed from Thulasendrapuram, would become the first woman US president.</p>

<p>"We hope she will win next time and visit our village. When that day comes, we will give her a grand reception. Meanwhile, we extend our best wishes to Donald Trump and hope he fosters good relations with India and promotes global peace," he added.</p>

<p>Trump was elected the 47th president of the United States.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump went from being a businessman, real estate tycoon and reality TV star to becoming the country's first former US President to be declared a convicted felon.</p>

<p>And after surviving two assassination bids during his 2024 campaign, the 78-year-old remains unstoppable with American voters giving him a second term. In the process, he shattered the dream of the Democratic Party, as well as that of millions of Kamala Harris supporters, to finally have the first woman President in the White House.</p>

<p>He is now the oldest person in US history to be elected president.</p>

<p>From the time he left office after his loss in the 2020 presidential election to his nomination as the Republican candidate in the 2024 race, Trump continued to dominate the American news cycle and the country's psyche.</p>

<p>He refused to accept the November 2020 result that brought Joe Biden to the White House, and a stunned nation watched his supporters storm the US Capitol on January 6. The riots disrupted a joint session of the US Congress which was in the process of affirming the presidential election results.</p>

<p>His third run for the job in 2024 was characterised by a slew of indictments and criminal cases, and a conviction in a New York court -- making him the first former US president to be held guilty of a crime.</p>

<p>A grand jury found him guilty on 34 counts of falsifying business records. The Biden-Harris campaign said at the time that no one is above the law while Trump called the verdict the result of a "rigged" political system.</p>

<p>Yet, none of this could deter his ardent supporters, who rallied behind him and his policies.</p>

<p>The vehement support was on full display in Milwaukee in July when Trump, with a bandaged ear after having survived an assassination attempt, arrived for the Republican National Convention to formally accept the party's nomination for President for the third consecutive election.</p>

<p>Trump was hit by a bullet in the upper part of his right ear when a shooter fired multiple shots at his election rally in Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>He was born in Queens, New York, on June 14, 1946, to Mary and Fred Trump, a successful real estate developer, as the fourth of their five children. He earned a degree in finance from the Wharton School of Finance and Commerce at the University of Pennsylvania in 1968.</p>

<p>After taking over his father's company in 1971, he renamed it the Trump Organisation and soon diversified into projects like hotels, resorts, residential and commercial buildings, casinos and golf courses. Trump also dabbled in Reality TV with 'The Apprentice' in 2004 that made him a household name in America.</p>

<p>Trump married Ivana Zelnickova, a Czech athlete and model, but divorced her in 1990. The couple has three children -- Donald Jr, Ivanka and Eric.</p>

<p>He then married actor Marla Maples in 1993 but divorced in 1999. They have an only child, Tiffany. Trump's current wife Melania, whom he married in 2005, is a former Slovenian model. They have a son, Barron William Trump.</p>

<p>In the 2016 presidential race, fighting as a Republican nominee in the presidential race, Trump won against the Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.</p>

<p>The 2024 election took place against the backdrop of concerns over the economy, illegal immigration and the wars in west Asia and Europe. Trump's support base saw him as the only one who could offer solutions to these.</p>

<p>"I will end the illegal immigration crisis by closing our border and finishing the wall, most of which I've already built," Trump told cheering supporters at his party's national convention, referring to the country's southern border.</p>

<p>He vowed that if he returned to the White House, "inflation will vanish completely".</p>

<p>Trump pledged to end the Russia-Ukraine war after Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy reached out to congratulate him on his Republican presidential nomination.</p>

<p>"I, as your next President of the United States, will bring peace to the world and end the war that has cost so many lives and devastated countless innocent families. Both sides will be able to come together and negotiate a deal that ends the violence and paves a path forward to prosperity," Trump had said.</p>

<p>The four years of his second presidency will define not just how the US deals with its pressing domestic issues, it could also dictate its place in the world. The world is watching.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With Donald Trump all set to become US president, Indian exporters may face high customs duties for goods like automobiles, textiles and pharmaceuticals if the new US administration decides to pursue the ‘America First' agenda, opined trade experts.</p>

<p>Experts also said that Trump could also tighten H-1B visa rules, impacting costs and growth for Indian IT firms.</p>

<p>Over 80 per cent of India's IT export earnings come from the US, making it vulnerable to changes in visa policies.</p>

<p>The US is India's largest trading partner, accounting for over USD 190 billion of annual trade.</p>

<p>Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI) Founder Ajay Srivastava said that Trump may extend tariffs beyond China to include India and other countries.</p>

<p>Trump had earlier called India a "large tariff abuser" and in October 2020 labelled India as the 'tariff king'.</p>

<p>These remarks suggest that Trump's second term could bring tougher trade negotiations. he said.</p>

<p>"His America First agenda would likely push for protective measures, such as reciprocal tariffs on Indian goods, potentially adding barriers for key Indian exports like automobiles, wines, textiles, and pharmaceuticals. These increases could make Indian products less competitive in the US, impacting revenue in these sectors," Srivastava said.</p>

<p>However, a tougher US stance on China could create new opportunities for Indian exporters, he added.</p>

<p>The bilateral trade in goods between the two countries stood at USD 120 billion in 2023-24 as against USD 129.4 billion in 2022-23.</p>

<p>A GTRI report had earlier stated that according to WTO's World Tariff Profiles 2023, the US also imposes high duties on items like dairy products (188 per cent), Fruits and vegetables (132 per cent), cereals and food preparations (193 per cent), oilseeds, fats and oils (164 per cent), beverages and tobacco (150 per cent).</p>

<p>International trade expert Biswajit Dhar said that Trump would increase tariffs in various sectors as he has to follow his call for MAGA (Make America Great Again).</p>

<p>"With Trump coming to power, we are going to enter a different era of protectionism," Dhar said adding sectors like electronics may get a hit.</p>

<p>He added that as earlier Trump has walked out of Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), there could be dark clouds on IPEF (Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity).</p>

<p>The 14-nation bloc was launched in Tokyo by the US and other Indo-Pacific countries on May 23, 2022.</p>

<p>"Let us see what he does with IPEF," Dhar cautioned and added that nothing is expected to move in the World Trade Organisation (WTO).</p>

<p>Federation of Indian Export Organisations (FIEO) DG Ajay Sahai said that "we could expect Mr Trump to push for more balanced trade. But trade disputes might arise around tariffs".</p>

<p>Going by the increasing trend of protectionism, Sahai said, the same would continue with tighter immigration rules.</p>

<p>Agneshwar Sen, Partner-Tax and Economic Policy (International Trade), EY India said it may be expected that the US will use high tariffs strategically to onshore manufacturing and change current supply chains.</p>

<p>India could face higher tariffs on exports like textiles, chemicals, pharma and auto/ engineering products, Sen said.</p>

<p>"India would have to either seek alternative markets (which will be difficult) or retaliate with its own tariffs on US exports. Alternately, we must be ready for a trade deal that is attractive to the US while not just protecting our current interests but creating newer ones," he added.</p>

<p>Further Srivastava said that Trump has expressed concerns about outsourcing, and while some statements may be campaign rhetoric, India should prepare for possible measures affecting IT exports.</p>

<p>H-1B visa policies are crucial for the movement of skilled professionals, especially from India's IT sector.</p>

<p>"Trump's stricter immigration stance could lead to changes in visa rules, impacting Indian IT professionals and raising costs for Indian IT companies," the GTRI Founder said.</p>

<p>However, he added that Trump is expected to ease labour and environmental standards, which could make it easier for Indian exports to enter the US market.</p>

<p>"Trump would likely push India to align closely with US geopolitical aims, potentially expanding India's role as an alternative supplier in sectors like electronics and pharmaceuticals but potentially limiting India's foreign policy flexibility," he said.</p>

<p>Likewise, India's increasing demand for advanced technology, energy, and capital goods from the US opens avenues for expanding bilateral trade.</p>

<p>Between FY'2020 and FY'2024, India's merchandise exports to America rose by 46 per cent from USD 53.1 billion to USD 77.5 billion.</p>

<p>Imports from the US also grew to USD 42.2 billion last fiscal from USD 35.8 billion in 2019-20.</p>

<p>On the other hand, trade in services between the two nations expanded from USD 54.1 billion in 2018 to an estimated USD 70.5 billion in 2024, a 30.3 rise.</p>

<p>India is also a key destination for American businesses such as professional, scientific, and technical services, manufacturing, and IT. Washington is the third largest investor. India received USD 66.7 billion between April 2000 and June 2024.</p>

<p>India buys military equipment and Boeings worth billions of dollars from the US and conducts its over 90 per cent global trade in US Dollars.</p>

<p>"The US firms like Google, Facebook gather Terabytes of data every day and earn billions of advertising dollars every year from India. Amazon which had to withdraw from China, is the biggest online retailer in India. The US earns dollars from India from various engagements and not just trade," Srivastava said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday congratulated Donald Trump, who claimed victory in the US presidential election, calling it "history's greatest comeback" and a new beginning in the US-Israel alliance.</p>

<p>The United States is Israel's top ally and military backer, and the election came at a critical time for the Middle East amid wars in Gaza and Lebanon.</p>

<p>"Congratulations on history's greatest comeback! Your historic return to the White House offers a new beginning for America and a powerful recommitment to the great alliance between Israel and America. This is a huge victory!" Netanyahu said in a statement issued by his office.</p>

Congratulations on history's greatest comeback!<br />

<br />

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Other Israeli officials also congratulated Trump, including Israel Katz who was named defence minister on Tuesday.</p>

<p>"Congratulations to President-elect @realDonald Trump on his historic victory. Together, we'll strengthen the US-Israel alliance, bring back the hostages, and stand firm to defeat the axis of evil led by Iran," Katz said on X.</p>

<p>President Isaac Herzog also applauded Trump and said he looked forward to strengthen US-Israel ties.</p>

<p>"Congratulations to President @realDonaldTrump on your historic return to the White House... I look forward to working with you to strengthen the ironclad bond between our peoples, to build a future of peace and security for the Middle East, and to uphold our shared values," Herzog said in a statement.</p>

<p>The statements came a day after Netanyahu sacked defence minister Yoav Gallant, following public differences over the war with Hamas in Gaza.</p>

<p>The removal of Gallant -- a hawk on the war with Hezbollah in Lebanon who also pushed for a ceasefire and hostage release deal in Gaza -- was announced on the same day as the presidential election in the United States, Israel's top military backer.</p>

<p>Netanyahu and Gallant have frequently clashed over Israel's retaliatory military offensive against Hamas following the Palestinian group's deadly attack on Israel on October 7 last year.</p>

<p>Shortly after Gallant's removal, thousands of people took to the streets of commercial hub Tel Aviv, chanting slogans against Netanyahu and demanding the return of 97 hostages held in Gaza.</p>

<p>Gideon Saar, who has been appointed as the new foreign minister to replace Katz, also welcomed Trump.</p>

<p>"We welcome your strong and dedicated leadership as we work to build a better future of security and cooperation for the Middle East," Saar said on X.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the projections for the US Presidential elections indicate a win for Republican candidate Donald Trump, the people of Kamala Harris' ancestral Thulasendrapuram village in Tamil Nadu expressed their disappointment since they had planned to celebrate the Democrat's victory by bursting crackers and organising a special victory prayer at the local temple.</p>

<p>Trump is set to become the 47th US President. Harris' supporter, Joy, who came to stay in the Thulasendrapuram village from Chicago earlier expressed confidence about the Democrat candidate winning the US elections.</p>

<p>"If Donald Trump wins, I hope he is given the wisdom to lead us with unity. My hope is that he changes his ways and becomes the one who unites and not a divider. My expectations are different though. I think our country will be in chaos for the next four years," Joy said.</p>

<p>"Just now I watched the result of the US elections. It is a little disappointing for us. Anyway, I hope that Donald Trump will change (his ways) and will not govern like he did earlier. Last time when Kamala won as the Vice Presidential candidate, we celebrated. This time we had planned to celebrate more. But we have to accept the mandate," a resident of the village said.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Meanwhile, Trump early on Wednesday morning hailed his countrymen as results of the high stakes presidential elections projected his victory which set poised to return him to the White House after securing an electoral college victory.</p>

<p>Speaking at an address to supporters in West Palm Beach, Florida, Trump affirmed that his win will help the country "heal."</p>

<p>Addressing the crowd accompanied by his running mate, JD Vance, and family members Trump called his projected win the "greatest political movement of all time" which will help in making "America great again."</p>

<p>"This is a movement like nobody has seen before. This was the greatest political movement of all time. There's nothing like this ever in this country...we are gonna help our country heal. We have a country that needs help and needs help very badly. We are gonna fix our borders, we are gonna fix everything about our country," Trump said.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Democratic Campaign co-chair Cedric Richmond said that the Vice President will not address supporters tonight, but is expected to speak tomorrow.</p>

<p>While addressing a gathering, Richmond said that the votes are yet to be counted and there were states that have not been called. "We still have votes to count. We still have states that have not been called yet," Cedric Richmond said.</p>

<p>Earlier in the day, special prayers were offered for the success of US Vice Presidential candidate JD Vance in Andhra Pradesh's Godavari district. The Vice Presidential candidate is the husband of Usha Vance who originally belonged to Vadluru village in the Nidadavolu assembly constituency.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Officials clarified that this test, planned years in advance, highlights nuclear readiness and US commitment to defense amid global security shifts.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Shortly before former President Donald Trump made a statement regarding his lead in the US presidential election, the US defence forces reportedly conducted a test launch of a Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), a move that underscored ongoing strategic defence readiness.</p>

<p>Launched from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California, the unarmed missile travelled more than 4,000 miles across the Pacific Ocean in the direction of the Kwajalein Atoll in the North Pacific. With a top speed of 15,000 miles per hour, the Minuteman III shows that the US military can hit targets anywhere in the world in 30 minutes.</p>

<p>However, the defence officials have clarified that the test was planned years in advance as part of regular drills, aimed at showcasing the "readiness of nuclear US forces." The launch underscores the US commitment to maintaining a state of readiness for its strategic arsenal amidst evolving global security landscapes.</p>

<p>"This test launch marks the start of a remarkable week for our Guardians and Airmen at Vandenberg, with two test launches scheduled from the Western Range," Colonel Bryan Titus, Space Launch Delta 30 vice commander, told<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://metro.co.uk/2024/11/06/us-military-decides-test-hypersonic-nuke-just-hours-ballots-close-21937103/"><em> The Metro.</em></a></p>

<p>"These tests hold immense significance, not only for our nation's defence but also serve as a pivotal moment in showcasing the exceptional capabilities and expertise of our dedicated team."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Donald Trump, who is on the brink of a landslide win in the US election, Republican Presidential candidate Donald Trump thanked his supporters today and described it as a "magnificent victory for the American people". He also referred to the July 13 assassination attempt and said "God spared my life for a reason".</p>

<p>The 78-year-old is currently projected to win 267 electoral college votes, three short of the magic figure of 270. The opponent, incumbent Vice President Kamala Harris is trailing at 224.</p>

<p>Describing the Republican campaign as the "greatest political movement of all time", Trump said, "We are going to help our country heal, fix our borders, we made history for a reason tonight. We have achieved the most incredible political win. I want to thank the American people. I will fight for you and your family with every breath in my body."</p>]]></content:encoded>

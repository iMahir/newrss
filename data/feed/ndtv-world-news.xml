       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US has handed over to India 297 antiquities during the visit of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. These antiquities were smuggled out of the country and were recovered. Trafficking of cultural property is a longstanding issue that has affected many cultures and countries throughout history, and India has been particularly hit.</p>

<p>"Deepening cultural connect and strengthening the fight against illicit trafficking of cultural properties. I am extremely grateful to President Biden and the US Government for ensuring the return of 297 invaluable antiquities to India," PM Modi said on X.</p>

<p>He thanked President Joe Biden for his support in the return of these artefacts. He noted that these objects were not just part of India's historical material culture, but formed the inner core of its civilisation and consciousness.</p>

<p>With this, the total number of ancient items recovered by India since 2014 has gone to 640, officials said, adding the number returned from the US alone will be 578. This is the maximum number of cultural artefacts returned by any country to India.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Prime Minister Narendra Modi will meet the Indian diaspora at the Nassau Coliseum in New York today. Hours earlier, he attended the Quad Summit, where he put forward India's views and commitments for global growth, development, peace and security.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<ol>
	<li>PM Modi has already met some members of the Indian diaspora. After he arrived at Hotel Lotte Palace in New York, the diaspora members greeted with a dance performance to an Indian folk song, and chanted "Modi! Modi!"</li>
	<li>"He has brought the golden age of India back. Modi ji is great... This is a historical moment for us to cherish," a diaspora member said.</li>
	<li>An Indian community member whose painting PM Modi had signed told news agency ANI, "I met the PM today. It felt really good. The moment he saw my painting, he asked me where I come from. I told him I come from the Mithila region. The painting is based on the theme of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam," she said.</li>
	<li>PM Modi yesterday had three separate bilateral meetings with Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and US President Joe Biden.</li>
	<li>At the Quad Leadership Summit later and others associated with it, PM Modi underlined India's approach of cooperation, contact, and engagement for growth with a variety of partners in the Indo-Pacific, Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri told reporters in New York.</li>
	<li>With the US, a special feature of the bilateral meeting was the return of 297 antiquities to India, a few of which were on display at Mr Biden's home during the bilateral meeting.</li>
	<li>"In fact, the Prime Minister today referred to the Quad in a very, very evocative way. He called it quick unified assistance delivery (QUAD). The other members of the Quad said they finally understood what Quad signified and stood for," Mr Misri said.</li>
	<li>PM Modi also mentioned that at a time when the world is ridden with tensions and conflicts, the coming together of these four Quad partners with shared democratic values is important for humanity. He said the Quad was here to stay, to assist, to partner and to complement the efforts of the Indo-Pacific countries.</li>
	<li>Among the major announcements from the summit was the Quad Cancer Moonshot, which is a groundbreaking partnership to address the challenges posed by cancer and in this particular instance cervical cancer.</li>
	<li>There was discussion on many regional and global issues, and among them the need for the reform of the multilateral system of governance, including the United Nations Security Council (UNSC).</li>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An Israeli airstrike killed seven people in a school sheltering displaced families in Gaza City on Sunday, Palestinian health officials said, with the Israeli military saying it had targeted militants operating from the compound.</p>

<p>The strike hit Kafr Qasem School in Beach camp at around 11 a.m. (0800 GMT), the officials said. Among those killed was Majed Saleh, the director of the Hamas-run Public Works and Housing ministry, they added.</p>

<p>Israel's military said the strike targeted Hamas fighters there, and that it had used aerial surveillance and taken other steps to limit the risk to civilians.</p>

<p>Hamas, the Islamist militant group that rules Gaza, has regularly denied Israeli accusations that it uses hospitals and other civilians buildings for military purposes in the near year-old war.</p>

<p>The attack and other reported violence in Gaza came amid a surge of strikes further north between Israel and the Iran-backed forces of Hezbollah across the border with Lebanon - a parallel conflict that had stoked fears of wider regional unrest.</p>

<p>Six other Palestinians were killed in separate airstrikes in central and southern parts of Gaza, the medics said. They put the number of Palestinians killed in Israeli strikes so far on Sunday at 16.</p>

<p>In Rafah, near Gaza's border with Egypt, residents said Israeli tanks advanced towards the western parts of the city, where the army has operated since May, and took positions over some hilltops overseeing the coastal road.</p>

<p>Israel's demands to keep control of the southern border line between Rafah and Egypt have been a major sticking point in internationals effort to conclude a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas.</p>

<p>Hamas's armed wing said fighters have mounted several attacks against Israeli forces in Rafah, firing anti-tank rockets and detonating bombs in houses where Israeli troops had taken positions.</p>

<p>In a statement on Saturday, the Israeli military said forces, operating in Rafah since May, have killed dozens of militants in recent weeks and dismantled military infrastructure and tunnel shafts.</p>

<p>On Sunday, Gaza's health ministry warned that all services in all hospitals could halt in 10 days because of the shortages in essential spare parts, and oil needed to operate the fuel-powered generators.</p>

<p>Adding to the turmoil and misery, heavy rain flooded tent encampments overnight.</p>

<p>"Ten minutes of rain were enough to sink the tents. What if it rained all day? Tents are already worn out and can't stand winter," said Aya, displaced with her family in the central city of Deir Al-Balah, where around a million people are sheltering.</p>

<p>"We don't want new tents. We want the war to end. We don't want temporary solutions in hell," the 30-year-old told Reuters via a chat app.</p>

<p>More shelters and supplies to help people cope with the coming winter were needed, Juliette Touma, Director of Communications of the U.N. Palestinian refugee agency UNRWA, said.</p>

<p>"With rain and temperatures dropping, people are likely to fall ill especially children who are most vulnerable to colds and flu," Touma told Reuters.</p>

<p>This war in the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict was triggered on Oct. 7 when Hamas attacked Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking about 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.</p>

<p>Israel's subsequent assault on the enclave has killed more than 41,300 Palestinians, according to the local health ministry, and displaced nearly the entire 2.3 million-strong population.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The women were charged with assisting other North Koreans in China to escape to South Korea.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>North Korea's recent actions have sparked international concern after two women, Ri and Kang, were executed on August 31 following a public trial in Chongjin, North Korea. According to Jang Se-yul, head of the Seoul-based human rights organization Gyeore'eol Unification Solidarity, the women were charged with assisting other North Koreans in China to escape to South Korea, <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.rfa.org/english/news/korea/north-korea-china-forced-repatriation-escapees-execution-09172024143449.html">Radio Free Asia</a></em> reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ri, 39, and Kang, 43, were among approximately 500 North Koreans forcibly repatriated by China in October 2023. Nine other women received life sentences on similar charges, highlighting the extreme measures taken by the North Korean government to deter defection.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to Radio Free Asia, a resident of Chongjin reported that two women were subjected to a public trial in a marketplace, attended by hundreds of residents and merchants. The trial, which lasted only an hour, commenced at 11 am and concluded with the execution of the two women by officials from Hamgyong province on the same day.</p>

<p>Notably, these executions are part of a larger pattern of North Korea's treatment of its citizens who attempt to defect or assist others in defecting. The country has a history of severe punishment for those caught trying to escape or helping others to do so.</p>

<p>Women comprise the majority of North Korean escapees seeking refuge in China. Upon crossing the border, many fall prey to Chinese handlers who exploit their desperation, selling them into servitude. These women are frequently forced into prostitution or coerced into becoming the unofficial wives of Chinese men.&nbsp;</p>

<p>''These two women were executed because they had sent North Korean escapees from China to their enemy country, South Korea. When they first escaped, they were sold to a Chinese adult entertainment business. When other North Korean women working there said they wanted to go to South Korea, they made arrangements to send them there,'' Mr&nbsp;Se-yul told <em>RFA Korean.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>The international community, including South Korea, has called for China to end these forced repatriations and provide asylum or safe passage to North Koreans fleeing their homeland.&nbsp;However, China maintains that it has a bilateral agreement with Pyongyang requiring the repatriation of North Korean escapees, labelling them "economic migrants."</p>

<p>Human rights groups have condemned China's actions, emphasizing that as a signatory to the 1951 Refugee Convention and the United Nations Convention against Torture, China should not force anyone back who would face persecution or torture.&nbsp;However, China has forcibly returned over 670 North Koreans since 2020, including a large group of 500 in October 2023.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To strengthen the fight against cervical cancer, India has pledged a grant of USD 7.5 million to the testing, screening, and diagnosis of the disease in the Indo-Pacific region.</p>

<p>Addressing the Cancer Moonshot event hosted by US President Joe Biden on the sidelines of the Quad Leaders' Summit in Delaware on Saturday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the initiative would go a long way in providing affordable, accessible and quality health care to people in Indo-Pacific countries.</p>

<p>The Quad Cancer Moonshot is a "groundbreaking partnership" to save lives in the Indo-Pacific region by combating cervical cancer. Through the initiative, the Quad countries comprising India, the US, Japan and Australia have committed to work together to address gaps in the cervical cancer care and treatment ecosystem in the Indo-Pacific countries.</p>

<p>As India's contribution to the Cancer Moonshot initiative, Modi announced the dedication of a grant of USD 7.5 million to cancer testing, screening, and diagnostics in the Indo-Pacific region.</p>

<p>"India is ready to share its experience and expertise," he said, asserting that the grant was made under India's vision of 'One Earth, One Heath'.</p>

<p>The prime minister also announced that India will provide support for radiotherapy treatment and capacity building for cancer prevention in the Indo-Pacific.</p>

<p>He also said that Indo-Pacific countries will be benefiting from the supply of 40 million doses of vaccine from India under GAVI, an international organisation created in 2000 to improve access to new and underused vaccines for children living in the world's poorest countries, and QUAD programmes.</p>

<p>"When the Quad acts, it is not just for nations, it is for the people. This is the true essence of our human-centric approach," Modi said.</p>

<p>The prime minister also underlined that India has developed a cervical cancer vaccine and is working on an AI-based treatment protocol for the disease.</p>

<p>India has offered technical assistance to interested countries in the Indo-Pacific region on DPI for cancer screening, care and continuum through its USD 10 million contribution to the Global Initiative on Digital Health.</p>

<p>According to a fact sheet issued by the White House on Saturday, the Quad Cancer Moonshot will serve to strengthen the overall cancer-care ecosystem in the Indo-Pacific by improving health infrastructure, expanding research collaborations, building data systems, and providing greater support for cancer prevention, detection, treatment, and care.</p>

<p>"Cervical cancer, while preventable through vaccination and usually treatable if detected early, remains the third leading cause of cancer deaths among women in the Indo-Pacific region. Fewer than one in 10 women in the Indo-Pacific have completed their human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination series, and fewer than 10% have undergone recent screening. Many countries in the region face challenges related to healthcare access, limited resources, and disparities in vaccination rates. Through this initiative, Quad countries will work to address these gaps by promoting HPV vaccination, increasing access to screenings, and expanding treatment options and care in underserved areas," it said.</p>

<p>The Quad countries will work together with United Nations agencies on bulk purchasing of HPV diagnostics to bring down the cost of cervical cancer screening, and work with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to improve access to and quality of medical imaging and radiation therapy, the fact sheet said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Airlines usually have strict restrictions about rodents on board, since they can chew through electrical wiring.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Scandinavian Airlines (SAS) flight from Oslo, Norway to Malaga, Spain was forced to make an emergency landing in Copenhagen, Denmark after a passenger discovered a live mouse in their in-flight meal. As a precautionary measure, the aircraft was diverted on Wednesday. According to SAS spokesperson Oystein Schmidt, the safety of passengers and crew prompted the diversion. Upon landing, the plane underwent a thorough inspection to locate the mouse, <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgmy2d09x2o">BBC</a></em> reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to the BBC, airlines usually have strict restrictions about rodents on board, since they can chew through electrical wiring.</p>

<p>Airline spokesperson Oystein Schmidt said, ''This is something that happens extremely rarely. We have established procedures for such situations, which also include a review with our suppliers to ensure this does not happen again.''</p>

<p>One passenger, Jarle Borrestad, wrote on <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.facebook.com/jarle.boerrestad/posts/pfbid0wAe5Sqtp54yqaft1jKVLBDwm5bTRmwUVJfGBj2MowwV5F9Cd7zz1vpBsaGVXRA4Tl">Facebook</a>: ''Believe it or not. A lady next to me at SAS opened the food and jumped a mouse out. Now we have turned around and landed at CPH [Copenhagen Airport] for flight changes.”</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" height="524" scrolling="no" src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fjarle.boerrestad%2Fposts%2Fpfbid03125ndWpdvf2vVf5STrwDgSNMF39id4oizqP8y5WFEmMvriL9TrUf8RemS3hSMWxsl&amp;show_text=true&amp;width=500" style="border:none;overflow:hidden" width="500"></iframe></p>

<p>He further recalled taking precautions, pulling his socks over his pant legs to prevent the mouse from crawling up. Despite the shocking discovery, he noted that fellow passengers remained remarkably calm, showing no signs of stress. After a brief delay of a few hours in Copenhagen, the passengers continued their journey to Malaga on a replacement aircraft.</p>

<p>This incident follows another rodent-related disruption last week, where a train service in southern England was stopped mid-journey due to two squirrels refusing to leave the carriage.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A Great Western Railway spokesperson said: "We can confirm that the 0854 Reading to Gatwick was terminated at Redhill after a couple of squirrels boarded the train at Gomshall without tickets, breaching railway byeclaws. We attempted to remove them at Redhill, but one refused to leave and was returned to Reading to bring an end to this nutty tail."</p>

Marcee Gray, 43, has been accused of taping her elderly mother, Deborah Polhamus, to a chair for nearly 24 hours and damaging her home during an incident in November, The Atlanta-Journal Constitution reported.</p>

<p>Indicted this week in Ben Hill County, Marcee Gray is charged with exploitation and intimidation of an elderly person, false imprisonment and criminal damage to property. She faces several felony charges and could receive up to 20 years in prison for the top charge of elder exploitation.</p>

<p>Authorities revealed that the incident began when Gray, in a fit of anger, demanded her mother accompany her to confront her ex-husband, Colin Gray. When Ms Polhamus refused, Gray allegedly taped her to a chair, stole her phone and damaged several parts of the house, including a bathroom mirror and a door.</p>

<p>The situation escalated further when, according to the police report, Gray threatened her mother saying she had to go with her because she was going to "kill her ex." When Ms Polhamus resisted, Gray pushed her against a wall, injuring her wrist.</p>

<p>Deborah Polhamus was discovered the following day by a family friend after her daughter, Annie Brown, who lives out of state, became concerned when her mother stopped answering her phone. "Deborah explained that she agreed that Marcee needed to be punished for what she [had] done, but she wanted Marcee to get help for her drug addiction," the police report stated.</p>

<p>This shocking incident coincides with the murder charges faced by Marcee Gray's teenage son, Colt Gray, who is accused of killing two students and two teachers at his school last month. Colt's father, Colin Gray, has also been charged with murder, accused of providing his son with the AR-15 rifle used in the shooting. Neither father nor son has entered a plea as of their September court appearances.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Colt Gray had sent an apologetic text to his mother the morning of the shooting, and she had reportedly called the school 30 minutes before the gunfire, attempting to warn them about her son's intentions. After the tragedy, she released a public statement insisting that her son "is not a monster," despite the horrific nature of his actions.</p>

<p>Marcee Gray's legal troubles have been long-standing, with a criminal record that spans nearly two decades. A former neighbour claimed she would sometimes lock Colt and his sister out of the house at night. However, Marcee's father, Charles Polhamus, defended his daughter, disputing any claims of child abuse, stating that she only tried to help Colt.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The highly anticipated sale of Coldplay's India concert tickets turned into a comedic frenzy on social media, as BookMyShow's website crashed seconds before going live.</p>

<p>After an eight-year-long wait, the iconic British rock band is returning to India, with three concerts scheduled for January 18, 19, and 21, 2025, at Mumbai's D.Y. Patil Sports Stadium. The much-anticipated event is part of their global <em>Music of the Spheres</em> World Tour.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Tickets for the first two concert dates went on sale today at 12 PM IST on BookMyShow. However, the excitement overwhelmed the platform, which crashed just seconds before sales for the Mumbai shows began. BookMyShow quickly recovered and resumed operations, with the tickets for the January 18 and 19 shows selling out rapidly.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While tickets for the first two days are no longer available, the ticketing process for the January 21 concert is still ongoing. Fans are eagerly trying to secure their spots for the final show.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, eager fans took to X to express their frustration and disappointment through hilarious memes. The hashtag #BookMyShow trended within minutes.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Sri Lanka's Marxist-leaning leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake has taken a commanding lead in the presidential election, winning approximately 53 per cent of the counted votes.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sri Lanka's Marxist-leaning leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake has taken a commanding <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/sri-lankas-marxist-politician-anura-kumara-dissanayake-leads-presidential-elections-vote-6621214 ">lead in the presidential election</a>, winning approximately 53 per cent of the counted votes. According to Sri Lanka's Election Commission, Dissanayake, contesting for the National People's Power alliance, surpassed opposition leader Sajith Premadasa (22 per cent) and President Ranil Wickremesinghe.</p>

<p><strong>Here are some facts about Anura Kumara Dissanayake:</strong></p>

<ol>
	<li aria-level="1">Anura Kumara Dissanayake was born on November 24, 1968, in Thambuththegama, Sri Lanka. His father was a labourer, and his mother was a housewife. He attended local schools and was the first from his college to get admission into University.</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Dissanayake became involved in the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) during his school years and fully engaged in politics during the 1987-1989 JVP insurrection. He initially studied at the University of Peradeniya but left due to threats, later graduating from the University of Kelaniya in 1995 with a degree in physical science.&nbsp;</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Anura Kumara Dissanayake rose through the ranks of the JVP, becoming a key figure in the party's leadership. In 1995, he was appointed National Organiser of the Socialist Students Association and joined the JVP's Central Working Committee. By 1998, he secured a prominent position in the JVP Politburo. During this time, the JVP re-entered mainstream politics under Somawansa Amarasinghe and initially supported Chandrika Kumaratunga's government, though they soon became vocal critics of her administration.</li>
	<li aria-level="1">In 2004, Dissanayake became a cabinet minister in President Chandrika Kumaratunga's government, handling agriculture, livestock, land, and irrigation. However, in 2005, he and other JVP ministers resigned in protest against a joint agreement between the government and the LTTE for tsunami relief coordination.</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Dissanayake became the JVP's leader in 2014, succeeding Somawansa Amarasinghe, and ran as the JVP's presidential candidate in 2019, finishing third with 3 per cent of the votes. He announced another presidential bid for the 2024 elections under the National People's Power (NPP). Known for his critical stance on Sri Lanka's economic policies, Dissanayake has opposed IMF conditions, advocating for renegotiations to reduce taxes like the Pay-As-You-Earn tax and eliminate VAT on essential items. His policies focus on increasing social welfare and supporting businesses through targeted taxation reforms.&nbsp;</li>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A gas explosion in a coal mine in Iran's South Khorasan Province killed at least 51 people and injured 20, Iran's state media said on Sunday. The accident was caused by a methane gas explosion in two blocks, B and C, of the mine run by the Madanjoo company, state media said.</p>

<p>"76% of the country's coal is provided from this region and around 8 to 10 big companies are working in the region including Madanjoo company," the governor of South Khorasan Province Ali Akbar Rahimi told state TV on Sunday.</p>

<p>The rescue operation in block B has been completed. Of the 47 workers who were in the block 30 died and 17 were injured, Rahimi said earlier.</p>

<p>Rescue operations in block C have started. Methane density in the block is high and the operation will take around 3-4 hours, he added.</p>

<p>There were 69 workers in the blocks at the time of the explosion, state TV reported.</p>

<p>"Seventeen injured people were transported to the hospital and 24 people are still missing," it said earlier on Sunday citing the head of Iran's Red Crescent.</p>

<p>The explosion occurred at 9 p.m. (1730 GMT) on Saturday, state media said.</p>

<p>President Masoud Pezeshkian expressed condolences to the victims' families. "I spoke with ministers and we will do our best to follow up," Pezeshkian said in televised comments.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A mass shooting involving several assailants has left at least four people dead and dozens wounded in the US state of Alabama, police said on Saturday.</p>

<p>"We believe that multiple shooters fired multiple shots on a group of people" in the Five Points South district of Birmingham just after 11:00 pm, police officer Truman Fitzgerald told local media.</p>

<p>Officers found two adult males and one adult female who was unresponsive on the sidewalk suffering from a gunshot wound, Fitzgerald said. All three were pronounced dead at the scene.</p>

<p>A fourth victim died at a local hospital, he added.</p>

<p>Dozens of people were wounded in the shooting with at least four sustaining life-threatening injuries, Fitzgerald said.</p>

<p>The others had "various injuries", he added.</p>

<p>Police have not got anyone in custody over the shooting, Fitzman said, urging the public to provide any information that could help the investigation.</p>

<p>Several agencies are involved in the investigation, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.</p>

<p>Fire rescue services at on the scene Saturday night and had cordoned off the area.</p>

<p>This year, there have been at least 403 mass shootings -- defined as a shooting involving at least four victims, dead or wounded -- across the United States, according to the Gun Violence Archive.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Both the Quad as a partnership and India's presence in such partnerships are expected to continue in a world where the rise of China remains a source of fragmentation in the current liberal or American world order.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-09/soo946v_quad-summit_625x300_22_September_24.jpeg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>The idea of the Quad is now almost two decades old, emerging for the first time after the tsunami in 2004. Yet, a tone of tentativeness seems to surround this diplomatic partnership, often reflected in experts and media questioning its worth, need, or even existence.</p>

<p>The fourth Quad leaders' summit in Wilmington, Delaware, was no different. Ahead of the summit's start, a reporter asked US President Joe Biden if the Quad would exist beyond November. He quipped, "Much beyond that", and then reiterated the sentiment in his opening statement at the summit. "Challenges will come, the world will change, but the Quad is here to stay." He was backed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India, who added that the Quad was here to assist, partner, and complement the efforts of Indo-Pacific countries.</p>

<h2><strong>The Impact Of AUKUS</strong></h2>

<p>In 2021, just a week before the first in-person Quad summit in Washington, D.C., the U.S. announced a new trilateral security partnership - AUKUS - with an objective similar to that of the Quad: promoting a free and open Indo-Pacific region. The announcement of AUKUS, with its clear military aspect, immediately raised questions about the Quad, a partnership without any military component.</p>

<p>The re-emergence of the Quad in 2017, after lying dormant for more than a decade, was tempered by some hesitation from India and Australia. India, a neighbour of China, and Australia, with its trade dependence on China, were wary of antagonising Beijing by appearing to participate in what Chinese President Xi Jinping called a 'U.S.-led Western effort' to contain, encircle, and suppress China.</p>

<p>However, 2020 changed the stance of both New Delhi and Canberra. India became locked in border friction with China in Eastern Ladakh, and Australia faced a trade backlash from China as it pushed for a resolution to identify the origin of COVID-19.</p>

<p>That year saw India advocating for the second and stand-alone ministerial meeting of the Quad in Tokyo, despite the ongoing pandemic. The first ministerial meeting took place in New York on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA). It was clear that inhibitions had been shed and the Quad was finally coming into its own.</p>

<h2><strong>Where Quad Has <em>Really </em>Proved Relevant</strong></h2>

<p>However, since the firming up of AUKUS - the security partnership between Australia, the UK, and the U.S. - comparisons are often drawn to the Quad and its possible ineffectiveness in containing China in the Indo-Pacific due to its lack of military muscle. Nevertheless, the Quad has positioned itself as relevant in another area: reducing China's influence in the global economic space.</p>

<p>This year, the Quad Summit announced the Supply Chains Contingency Network to enhance the resilience of semiconductor supply chains. This is a critical area as semiconductors play a vital role in today's world, particularly in advanced economies. A 2023 report by the research institute RAND stated that Taiwan's dominance in global semiconductor production creates geopolitical and economic vulnerabilities for the US and its allies, as well as for Taiwan, which provides China with a potential asymmetric advantage. The report pointed out that a supply chain disruption could severely impact the U.S. economy and recommended that instead of acting unilaterally, Washington should engage its allies and partners to respond as a united, multinational bloc.</p>

<p>Another example is from 2021: the Quad vaccine partnership. As many as 400 million COVID-19 vaccine doses were delivered to Indo-Pacific countries to curtail China's vaccine outreach and influence in Southeast Asian nations. A consultancy that tracks China's impact on global health, Bridge Consulting, reported that China's vaccine deliveries in the Asia-Pacific category totalled 890 million by December 2022.</p>

<h2><strong>Quad Is More Useful For US. Clue: India</strong></h2>

<p>Moreover, while AUKUS is a completely global Western alliance, India's presence in the Quad makes it more useful for America. This can be better understood through John Ikenberry's framework of Three Worlds: the West, East, and South, and the competition to shape the global order. He states that the main axis of the struggle over world order runs between the global West and the global East (China and Russia). Ikenberry describes the global South as a "swing grouping", available to join other states in ways that tilt world politics in one direction or the other. It is this role that India fulfils and leverages through its participation in the Quad.</p>

<p>Hence, both the Quad as a partnership and India's presence in such partnerships are expected to continue in a world where the rise of China remains a source of fragmentation in the current liberal or American world order.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the 2024 US presidential campaign heats up, Donald Trump faces significant financial challenges. Recent federal filings reveal that Trump's fundraising efforts lag behind those of his Democratic opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, who raised a staggering $190 million in August, compared to Trump's $45 million during the same period.</p>

<p>In a bid to boost his finances, the former US president has turned to <a href="https://www.trumpstore.com/">selling a range of merchandise</a> to his supporters, including:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Silver Coins: Priced at $100 each, these coins feature Trump's profile and the White House.</li>
	<li>NFT Trading Cards: Trump's fourth series of digital collectibles, selling for $99 each.</li>
	<li>High-Top Sneakers: Launched in February, with prices ranging from $99 to $399 per pair.</li>
	<li>Bible: Priced at $60, these were endorsed by Trump in partnership with singer Lee Greenwood.</li>
</ul>

<p>Donald Trump's foray into merchandise has already seen financial success. His $60 Bible reportedly generated around $300,000 in sales, as per <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/21/politics/fundraising-harris-trump-elon-musk/index.html">CNN</a>. The limited edition sneakers sold out, yielding at least $399,000 in revenue. However, the most lucrative of his ventures has been the NFTs, which netted Trump approximately $7.2 million in licensing fees.</p>

<p>The Trump campaign arm also received a <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/elon-musk-donates-sizeable-amount-to-trump-campaign-ahead-of-us-polls-6094779 ">six-figure donation </a>($289,100) from billionaire Elon Musk in July.</p>

<p>Despite these efforts, Trump's legal challenges continue to pile up, leading to mounting expenses. Recent reports indicate that his legal fees across multiple trials have reached nearly $6 million, with orders to pay over $440 million stemming from a fraud trial against him and the Trump Organisation.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Harris's campaign expenditures were also substantial, spending about $174 million in August, with $135 million directed toward advertising. In contrast, Trump's campaign spent $61 million, primarily on media buys. As a result, Harris's campaign entered September with $235 million available, far surpassing Trump's $135 million.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) also significantly outperformed the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC), raising $22.3 million compared to $9.7 million.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Reza Seraj, former foreign intelligence chief of Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), died on September 21 after undergoing surgery for a brain tumour. Seraj played a critical role in Iran's overseas assassination plots and was designated by the US Treasury Department for human rights abuses.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BREAKING?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#BREAKING</a> The IRGC-Intelligence Organization's former Foreign Intelligence chief Reza Seraj has died of "brain tumor", according to Iranian state media.<br />
The US-designated official previously led the IRGC-IO Special Operations Division "focused on special activity against Israel,… <a href="https://t.co/PGyHVSOUdo">pic.twitter.com/PGyHVSOUdo</a></p>
— Iran International English (@IranIntl_En) <a href="https://twitter.com/IranIntl_En/status/1837489438852591987?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 21, 2024</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Reza Seraj was a key figure in orchestrating the IRGC's covert operations abroad. Last year, the US Treasury Department sanctioned him for his involvement in overseas assassination attempts and numerous human rights violations in Iran.&nbsp;</p>

<p>His career within Iran's intelligence apparatus spanned decades, beginning in the 1990s when he operated as a senior interrogator under the alias "Alavi," notorious for extracting forced confessions from political and student activists through torture.</p>

<p>Among his controversial actions was his leadership of the IRGC's Special Intelligence Directorate, Unit 4000, where his role in an uncovered plot to assassinate an Israeli in Cyprus eventually led to his removal. Javad Ghaffari, a figure once expelled from Syria, took over the unit following Seraj's dismissal.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Throughout his career, Seraj earned a reputation for his brutal interrogation tactics, which impacted numerous activists, including political figure Ali Afshari. In a recent interview, Afshari described Seraj as the lead interrogator responsible for his suffering during his 2000 arrest.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ahmad Batebi, a journalist, also pointed to Seraj's role in his own mistreatment, detailing the torture he endured that resulted in false confessions aired on state television.</p>

<p>Reza Seraj's influence extended beyond Iran's intelligence community. He served as head of the Student Basij, where he was instrumental in the suppression of student protests in 2009, and later appeared frequently in state media as an "academic and analyst." His involvement in these protests and his broader work for the regime made him a target for human rights organisations.</p>

<p>In his later years, Seraj held key roles within the Supreme National Security Council, serving as a spokesperson and communications deputy. Despite his varied titles and public appearances, his legacy remains tainted by his human rights abuses, with many viewing him as a key figure in Iran's repressive apparatus.</p>

<p>Reza Seraj was linked to numerous violent incidents, including the attack on political prisoners in Evin Prison in 2014, known as "Black Thursday." He was also responsible for increasing the sentence of Gholamreza Khosravi Savadjani, a political prisoner, from three years to execution. Khosravi was hanged in June 2014, less than two months after the attack.</p>

<p>Despite his controversial past, IRGC Commander-in-Chief Hossein Salami praised Seraj in a statement following his death, commending his efforts to confront anti-government protests. Salami hailed Seraj's dedication to protecting the Islamic Revolution and combating dissent.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Only a select group of 50 jet jockeys worldwide possess the skill to master the demanding manoeuvres needed to land at Paro.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nestled between towering Himalayan peaks and residential areas, Paro International Airport in Bhutan is one of the world's most notorious airstrips. Its treacherous approach, requiring pilots to navigate between 18,000-foot mountains, has earned a reputation for its extreme challenges.</p>

<p>Only a select group of 50 jet jockeys worldwide possess the skill to master the demanding manoeuvres needed to land at Paro. The small, 7,431-foot-long runway, accessible only to smaller aircraft, necessitates specialized training and the ability to land without radar guidance. Even a minor miscalculation could result in a plane crashing into a nearby home.</p>

<p>Category C qualified pilots who can successfully land at Paro are celebrated as aviation daredevils, earning a reputation akin to the legendary Maverick from "Top Gun."</p>

<p>"It is challenging on the skill of the pilot, but it's not dangerous, Captain Chimi Dorji of Druk Air, a local carrier, told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://edition.cnn.com/travel/paro-bhutan-airport-landing-intl-hnk/index.html" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>CNN</em></a>.</p>

<p>"In Paro, you really need to have the local skills and local knowledge area competence. We call it area competence training or area training or route training from flying from anywhere into Paro."</p>

<p></p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-media-max-width="560">

— Planesanity (@planesanity) <a href="https://twitter.com/planesanity/status/1798045750196371916?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 4, 2024</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p></p>

<p>In a country where 97% of the terrain is mountainous - with Paro sitting 7,382 feet above sea level - the thinner air also means aircraft move faster, explained Dorji.</p>

<p>"Your true airspeed remains the same, but your ground speed increases due to the thinner air."</p>

<p>Even if pilots manage to navigate through the narrow approach window for a proper landing, another major challenge in this remote Asian kingdom is the unpredictable weather.</p>

<p>The next critical factor to consider is the weather.</p>

<p>"We try to avoid flying after noon because that's when thermal winds pick up. The temperatures rise, the rains haven't arrived yet, and the land is dry, creating updrafts and anabatic/katabatic winds in the valley," said Dorji. "Mornings are much calmer."</p>

<p>However, the monsoon season, which often brings hail the size of golf balls, presents a whole new set of challenges.</p>

<p>"We get strong northwesterly and northeasterly winds coming from China, leading to periods of continuous rain," the pilot explained.</p>

<p>Since radar is ineffective in this area, no night flights are permitted at any time.</p>

<p>And, of course, there's always the risk of crashing into the surrounding mountains, which Dorji simply referred to as "obstacles."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Israel closed schools and restricted gatherings in many northern areas of the country and the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights early on Sunday.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel and Lebanon exchanged heavy fire into Sunday, with Israeli warplanes carrying out the most intense bombardment in almost a year of war across Lebanon's south, while Hezbollah claimed rocket attacks on military targets in Israel's north. The Israeli military said it struck around 290 targets on Saturday including thousands of Hezbollah rocket launcher barrels and said it would continue to strike targets of the Iran-backed movement.</p>

<p>Israel closed schools and restricted gatherings in many northern areas of the country and the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights early on Sunday.</p>

<p>Sirens sounded all night as multiple rockets and missiles were fired from Lebanon and Iraq, most of which were intercepted by Israeli aerial defence systems, the military said.</p>

<p>Israeli media reported that a number of buildings were hit directly or by falling missile debris, and ambulance services said they treated some lightly injured people. No serious casualties were reported.</p>

<p>Hezbollah said it targeted the Israeli Ramat David Airbase with dozens of missiles in response to "repeated Israeli attacks on Lebanon", the group posted on its Telegram channel early on Sunday.</p>

<p>The successive barrages of rocket attacks launched by Hezbollah at Ramat David are the deepest strikes it has claimed since hostilities began.</p>

<p>Iran-backed Iraqi militants in a statement also claimed an explosive drone attack on Israel early on Sunday.</p>

<h3><strong>ESCALATING ATTACKS</strong></h3>

<p>The escalating attacks come less than 48 hours after an Israeli airstrike targeting Hezbollah commanders killed at least 37 people in a suburb of the Lebanese capital, according to authorities.</p>

<p>Hezbollah, a powerful Iran-backed group, said 16 members including senior leader Ibrahim Aqil and another commander, Ahmed Wahbi, were among those killed on Friday in the deadliest strike in nearly a year of conflict with Israel.</p>

<p>Israel's army said it hit an underground gathering of Aqil and leaders of Hezbollah's elite Radwan forces, and had almost completely dismantled its military chain of command.</p>

<p>The attack levelled a multi-story residential building in the crowded suburb and damaged a nursery next door, a security source said. Three children and seven women were among those killed, according to Lebanon's health ministry.</p>

<p>Friday's strike sharply escalated the conflict and inflicted another blow on Hezbollah after two days of attacks in which pagers and walkie-talkies used by its members exploded.</p>

<p>The death count in those attacks, widely believed to have been carried out by Israel, has risen to 39 with more than 3,000 injured. Israel has neither confirmed nor denied involvement.</p>

<p>In what it said was the initial retaliation for the attacks with the exploding devices, Hezbollah on Sunday posted on its Telegram channel that it had launched rockets at Israeli military-industry facilities.</p>

<p>Israel quickly responded, striking Hezbollah targets in Lebanon, the military said in a statement.</p>

<p>U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan said he was worried about escalation but that the Israeli killing of a top Hezbollah leader brought justice to the group, which Washington designates a terrorist organization.</p>

<p>"While the risk of escalation is real, we actually believe there is also a distinct avenue to getting to a cessation of hostilities and a durable solution that makes people on both sides of the border feel secure," Sullivan told reporters.</p>

<p>Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati cancelled a planned trip to the U.N. General Assembly in New York.</p>

<h3><strong>ISRAEL BRACES FOR RETALIATION</strong></h3>

<p>Hezbollah has said it would keep fighting Israel until it agrees to a ceasefire in its war against Hamas in the Palestinian enclave of Gaza - triggered by a Hamas-led rampage in southern Israel on Oct. 7.</p>

<p>U.S. officials say that is unlikely anytime soon. Israel wants Hezbollah to cease fire and withdraw forces from the border region, adhering to a U.N. resolution signed with Israel in 2006, irrespective of any Gaza deal.</p>

<p>Anticipating retaliation, the Israeli military restricted gatherings and raised the alert level for residents of northern communities. The alert went as far south as the coastal city of Haifa, signalling Israel thought Hezbollah could strike deeper than it had since the war with Hamas began.</p>

<p>In southern Lebanon on Saturday, people described huge explosions that lit up the night sky and shook the ground as Israel carried out its latest strikes.</p>

<p>Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant, who said last week Israel was launching a new phase of war on the northern border, posted on X: "The sequence of actions in the new phase will continue until our goal is achieved: the safe return of the residents of the north to their homes."</p>

<p>Tens of thousands of people have left their homes on both sides of the Israel-Lebanon border since Hezbollah began firing rockets at Israel in October in sympathy with Palestinians in Gaza.</p>

<p>A communique from a U.S. summit hosted by President Joe Biden with the leaders of Japan, India and Australia stressed the need to prevent the Gaza war "from escalating and spilling over in the region" but did not specifically mention the Israel-Hezbollah conflict.</p>

<p>With at least 70 people killed in Lebanon over the past week, the conflict toll in the country since October has surpassed 740 during the worst Israel-Hezbollah flare-up since a 2006 war.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Born in 1921, Reinhold Kulle joined the Hitler Youth and volunteered for the Waffen-SS in 1940.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Reinhold Kulle and his family embarked on a journey from Cuxhaven, Germany, aboard the MS Italia on October 26, 1957, seeking a fresh start in America. However, Kulle harboured a chilling secret from his past, reveals Michael Soffer's book <em>Our Nazi: An American Suburb's Encounter with Evil</em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Our-Nazi-American-Encounter-Revisions/dp/0226835545?tag=nypost-20&amp;asc_refurl=https%%2F%2Fnypost.com%2F2024%2F09%2F21%2Flifestyle%2Fmeet-the-nazi-who-hid-in-plain-sight-in-suburban-chicago-for-nearly-30-years%2F&amp;asc_source=web&amp;ascsubtag=srctok-a99f3d6c1bb97ae7&amp;btn_ref=srctok-a99f3d6c1bb97ae7 ">.</a></p>

<p>During World War II, Reinhold Kulle was not just a member of the Nazi regime; he served in the Waffen-SS and worked at the Gross-Rosen concentration camp, where approximately 40,000 Jews were killed. Born in 1921, Kulle was recruited into the Hitler Youth and later volunteered for the combat wing of the Waffen-SS in 1940. While many boys feared the atrocities associated with the SS, Kulle remained undeterred.</p>

<p>After being injured on the Eastern Front, he was reassigned to Gross-Rosen, which was initially intended as a labour camp. According to the book, a grim compromise within Nazi leadership led to the systematic murder of the weak and elderly, and overcrowding resulted in dire conditions. By 1944, the camp housed over 40,000 prisoners, overwhelming its facilities and sanitation systems.</p>

<p>As the war ended, the Displaced Persons Act of 1948 opened doors for former Nazis like Kulle to immigrate to the US. With a newly acquired visa, Reinhold Kulle arrived in New York and eventually settled in Oak Park, near Chicago. He found work as a custodian at Oak Park and River Forest High School.</p>

<p>Reinhold Kulle's life appeared unremarkable – he was a dependable worker and family man, mixing effortlessly into suburban life. However, he was not alone. Others in the community, like Albert Deutscher, shared similar dark pasts. Deutscher, who had committed atrocities during the war, faced allegations from the Office of Special Investigations (OSI) and died by suicide as the pressure mounted.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1981, Reinhold Kulle became a target of OSI investigations into suspected Nazis. When Kulle received a letter from the OSI in 1982, it marked the beginning of the end for his decades of silence. The authorities had gathered incriminating evidence, including his SS file and photographs in uniform. Despite claiming he had only escorted prisoners, Reinhold Kulle's falsehoods on his visa application provided grounds for deportation.</p>

<p>In December 1982, the Chicago Sun-Times broke the story, revealing Kulle's past. While many demanded his deportation, a surprising number defended him.</p>

<p>After a prolonged legal battle, Kulle was ordered deported in November 1984. On October 26, 1987, he boarded a plane back to Germany, leaving behind a life built on a foundation of secrets. Though he lost touch with friends and community members, he continued to receive a pension until his death in 2006, living out his days as a free man.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump on Saturday rejected a second debate against Kamala Harris before the November 5 election, saying it was "too late" with early voting already underway in some states. Earlier on Saturday, Harris's campaign said she had accepted an invitation from broadcaster CNN to participate in a debate on October 23. It would have been the candidates' second debate, after a September 10 encounter that most pundits said she had won.</p>

<p>"The American people deserve another opportunity to see Vice President Kamala Harris and Donald Trump debate before they cast their ballots," her campaign chair Jen O'Malley Dillon said in a statement.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I hope (Trump) will join me," Harris posted on X.</p>

<p>Trump claimed during a campaign rally in the battleground state of North Carolina that he would like to debate -- calling it "good entertainment value" -- but the start of early voting in some states had taken the air out of the idea.</p>

<p>"It's just too late, voting has already started," he said.</p>

<p>He added, to a large and enthusiastic crowd of supporters, that while CNN had been "very fair" when he debated President Joe Biden in June, "they won't be fair again."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Vice President Harris replaced her boss at the top of the Democratic ticket after the 81-year-old Biden's disastrous performance against Trump.</p>

<p>His exit from the race left Trump, 78, now the oldest-ever presidential nominee, against a much younger Harris, 59.</p>

<h3><strong>Voting underway</strong></h3>

<p>Saturday's announcement came as some states have already begun early voting in what is an agonizingly close race.</p>

<p>The result is expected to hinge on seven battleground states, including North Carolina.</p>

<p>Trump addressed the crowd in the port city of Wilmington from behind bulletproof glass, following an apparent second assassination attempt against him.</p>

<p>A gunman was discovered on his golf course in Florida last Sunday, with security agents foiling any plan to harm the former president.</p>

<p>In July, Trump was struck on the ear by a bullet at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, after a gunman opened fire from a nearby rooftop. The US Secret Service -- tasked with protecting the candidate -- on Friday admitted to "deficiencies" and "complacency" in the shocking security breach.</p>

<h3><strong>Anti-immigrant rhetoric</strong></h3>

<p>Trump won North Carolina in the 2020 election against Biden.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But Harris is aiming to flip the southeastern state for Democrats, on the strength of her support from African Americans and young voters.</p>

<p>Trump's speech on Saturday reinforced the hardline anti-immigrant rhetoric that has become a centerpiece of his campaign, falsely claiming migrants were "attacking villages and cities all throughout the Midwest."</p>

<p>He also promised the crowd that the United States would "reach Mars before the end of my term."</p>

<p>The former president was facing a new challenge in North Carolina after a bombshell report on Thursday revealed that Mark Robinson, the Republican candidate for governor whom Trump has endorsed, had called himself a "Black Nazi" and made other incendiary comments on a porn website message board more than a decade ago.</p>

<p>Robinson has denounced the CNN report as "salacious tabloid lies."</p>

<p>The presidential race remains neck-and-neck and every vote will count in the election, whose result Trump has once again refused to say he will accept if he loses.</p>

<p>Trump faces criminal charges for allegedly trying to overturn the 2020 result, after which his supporters violently stormed the US Capitol on January 6, 2021.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p><strong>Boost For India-US Ties</strong></p>

<p>The Prime Minister met the US president at his home in Wilmington, North Carolina. At the meeting, the Prime Minister conveyed his appreciation for President Biden's unparalleled contributions in giving impetus to the India-US partnership, the Ministry of External Affairs said. Recalling his earlier visit to the US last year and President Biden's India trip for the G20 summit, the Prime Minister noted that visits have led to greater dynamism and depth in the India-US partnership.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister emphasised that India and the US now enjoy a comprehensive global strategic partnership that covers all areas of human endeavour, driven by shared democratic values, convergence of interests and vibrant people-to-people ties, the MEA said. It added that the two leaders discussed ways to enhance bilateral cooperation in areas of mutual interest and exchanged views on global and regional issues, including the Indo-Pacific region and beyond.</p>

<p><strong>India's Global Role</strong></p>

<p>President Biden expressed appreciation for India's leadership on the world stage, particularly Prime Minister Modi's leadership in the G20 and the Global South, a White House statement said. The US President also praised the Prime Minister's commitment to strengthen the Quad to ensure a free, open, and prosperous Indo-Pacific.</p>

<p>"India is at the forefront of efforts to seek solutions to the most pressing challenges, from supporting the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic to addressing the devastating consequences of conflicts around the world," the White House said.</p>

<p>President Biden, it said, commended Prime Minister Modi for his historic visits to Poland and Ukraine, the first by an Indian Prime Minister in decades, and his message of peace and ongoing humanitarian support for Ukraine. The statement was silent on the Prime Minister's visit to Russia.</p>

<p>President Biden told Prime Minister Modi that the US supports initiatives to reform global institutions to "reflect India's important voice". The US also backed permanent membership for India in a reformed UN Security Council.</p>

<p><strong>Space To Semiconductors</strong></p>

<p>The White House has said that the two leaders cheered the success of the Initiative on Critical and Emerging Technology (iCET) in deepening and expanding strategic cooperation across key technology sectors, including space, semiconductors, and advanced telecommunications.</p>

<p>"Both Leaders committed to enhance regular engagements to improve the momentum of collaboration in fields such as artificial intelligence, quantum, biotechnology, and clean energy. They highlighted ongoing efforts to strengthen collaboration with like-minded partners, including through the Quad and a U.S.-India-ROK Trilateral Technology initiative launched earlier this year to build more secure and resilient supply chains for critical industries and ensure we collectively remain at the leading edge of innovation," the statement said. The leaders, it said, also endorsed new mechanisms for deeper cyberspace cooperation through the bilateral cybersecurity dialogue.</p>

<p>"President Biden and Prime Minister Modi hailed a watershed arrangement to establish a new semiconductor fabrication plant focused on advanced sensing, communication, and power electronics for national security, next generation telecommunications, and green energy applications," the White House said, adding that the two leaders praised combined efforts to facilitate resilient, secure, and sustainable semiconductor supply chains.</p>

<p>In the space technology sector, the two leaders welcomed the progress towards the first joint effort by NASA and ISRO to conduct scientific research onboard the International Space Station in 2025.</p>

<p><strong>Impetus To Defence Ties</strong></p>

<p>The US president welcomed the progress in India completing the procurement of 31 General Atomics MQ-9B (16 Sky Guardian and 15 Sea Guardian) remotely piloted aircraft and their associated equipment, the White House said, adding that these will enhance the intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities of India's armed forces.</p>

<p>The two leaders recognised the progress under the US-India Defense Industrial Cooperation Roadmap, including ongoing collaboration to advance priority co-production arrangements for jet engines, munitions, and ground mobility systems. Prime Minister Modi and President Biden also welcomed efforts to expand defence industrial partnerships.</p>

<p>"President Biden welcomed India's decision to set a uniform Goods and Services Tax (GST) of 5 per cent on the maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) sector, including on all aircraft and aircraft engine parts thereby simplifying the tax structure and paving the way for building a strong ecosystem for MRO services in India. The Leaders also encouraged the industry to foster collaboration and drive innovation to support India's efforts to become a leading aviation hub," the White House said.</p>

<p>"The Leaders hailed the teaming agreement on the C-130J Super Hercules aircraft recently signed between Lockheed Martin and Tata Advanced Systems Limited, the two companies that co-chair the U.S.-India CEO Forum. Building on longstanding industry cooperation, this agreement will establish a new Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MRO) facility in India to support the readiness of the Indian fleet and global partners who operate the C-130 Super Hercules aircraft," it said, adding that this marks a significant step in US-India cooperation in the defence and aerospace sector.</p>

<p><strong>Clean Energy</strong></p>

<p>Prime Minister Modi and President Biden welcomed the joint efforts to accelerate the expansion of safe and secure clean energy supply chains through US and Indian manufacturing of clean energy technologies and components. "In its initial phase, the U.S. and India would work together to unlock $1 billion of multilateral financing to support projects across the clean energy value chain for renewable energy, energy storage, power grid and transmission technologies, high efficiency cooling systems, zero emission vehicles, and other emerging clean technologies," the White House said.</p>

<p>"The Leaders also highlighted the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC)'s partnership with India's private sector to expand clean energy manufacturing and diversify supply chains. To date, DFC has extended a $250 million loan to Tata Power Solar to construct a solar cell manufacturing facility and a $500 million loan to First Solar to construct and operate a solar module manufacturing facility in India," it added.</p>

<p>The two leaders welcomed the India-US collaboration on a new National Center for Hydrogen Safety in India and affirmed their intent to utilise the new Renewable Energy Technology Action Platform (RETAP) to enhance collaboration on clean energy manufacturing and global supply chains.</p>

<p>"The Leaders welcomed the progress made on joint efforts since 2023 for India to work toward IEA membership in accordance with the provisions of the Agreement on an International Energy Program.</p>

<p>The two Leaders reaffirmed their commitment to accelerating the manufacturing and deployment of renewable energy, battery storage and emerging clean technology in India," the White House said.</p>

<p><strong>Promoting Global Health and Development</strong></p>

<p>The two leaders celebrated the new US-India Drug Policy Framework, which will deepen the collaboration to disrupt the illicit production and international trafficking of synthetic drugs and precursor chemicals, and deepen a holistic public health partnership.</p>

<p>"The Leaders applauded the first-ever U.S.-India Cancer Dialogue held in August 2024, which brought together experts from both countries to increase research and development to accelerate the rate of progress against cancer," the White House said.</p>

<p>"The leaders welcomed the signing of Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises and Small Business Administration for promoting cooperation between U.S. and Indian small and medium-size enterprises by improving their participation in the global market place through capacity building workshops in areas such as trade and export finance, technology and digital trade, green economy and trade facilitation," it said.</p>

<p>"The Leaders welcomed enhanced cooperation on agriculture between the U.S. Department of Agriculture and India's Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, in areas such as climate-smart agriculture, agriculture productivity growth, agriculture innovation, and sharing best practices related to crop risk protection and agriculture credit. The two sides will also enhance cooperation with the private sector through discussions on regulatory issues and innovation to enhance bilateral trade," the White House said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

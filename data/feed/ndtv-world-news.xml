       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US government has launched a high-profile sex trafficking and racketeering case against music mogul Sean Combs, aka Diddy, accusing him of orchestrating coercive and abusive sexual encounters at luxury hotels. The indictment, which includes accusations of arson, bribery, kidnapping and obstruction of justice, centres on what prosecutors refer to as&nbsp;“freak-offs”&nbsp;-&nbsp;“elaborate and produced sex&nbsp;performances,”&nbsp;involving drugs, prostitutes, and recordings - according to a report in the New York Times.&nbsp;Combs'&nbsp;legal team, however, insists these encounters were consensual.</p>

<p>According to the 14-page federal criminal indictment, these&nbsp;“freak-offs”&nbsp;were organised by Combs and his associates in hotel suites filled with baby oil, drugs and video equipment. Prosecutors allege that participants were coerced, with some requiring intravenous fluids to recover from the multi-day ordeals. The government claims Combs filmed the sessions and used the footage to blackmail participants into silence.</p>

<p>“Freak-off activity is the core of this case, and freak-offs are inherently dangerous,”&nbsp;said Emily A Johnson, one of the prosecutors. This depiction&nbsp;is echoed&nbsp;in the civil lawsuit filed by singer Cassie, whose real name is Casandra Ventura, against Combs last year. Cassie claimed that Combs directed frequent freak-offs, where she&nbsp;was coerced&nbsp;into performing sexual acts, which he filmed.</p>

<p>Combs, who has pleaded not guilty, faces a vastly different narrative presented by his defence team. His lawyer, Marc Agnifilo, argued the events were consensual, part of an unconventional but voluntary relationship between Combs and Ventura. Agnifilo pointed out that several men involved denied being coerced or viewing themselves as sex workers.</p>

<p>The racketeering charges stem from allegations that Combs coordinated these events through a network of enablers who managed logistics such as securing prostitutes, booking hotel rooms, and cleaning up after the sessions. Prosecutors argue that violence often accompanied these encounters, a claim the defence denies.</p>

<p>In addition to&nbsp;Ventura's&nbsp;lawsuit, Combs faces a series of other civil suits from women who accuse him of drug-fuelled sexual abuse. One complainant, Adria English, alleged that Combs demanded she has sex with guests at his famous&nbsp;“white parties.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Combs's&nbsp;lawyers have dismissed the lawsuits as opportunistic.</p>

<p>Combs, who remains in federal custody after being denied bail, is accused of attempting to cover up evidence of the abuse. Prosecutors claim he offered hotel staff bribes and&nbsp;attempted&nbsp;to destroy surveillance footage after an alleged assault on Ventura in 2016.The investigation is underway, and&nbsp;Combs's&nbsp;legal battle is far from over.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The allegations against Combs go back to the 1990s when he founded Bad Boy Records, his label, according to Forbes.&nbsp;In 2022, he was in the&nbsp;14the&nbsp;spot among&nbsp;Forbes'&nbsp;list of the highest-paid entertainers after he made an estimated $90 million that year.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Holloman, who has no prior criminal record, was taken into custody on September 19.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A decades-old cold case has been solved with the arrest of a man accused of murdering a young mother in Boston. James Holloman has been charged with the 1988 stabbing death of Karen Taylor after DNA evidence linked him to the crime scene, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://people.com/mans-spit-leads-to-his-arrest-in-1988-cold-case-murder-boston-woman-8716440" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>People</em></a> reported.</p>

<p>Although a check made out to Holloman was found near Taylor's body, authorities had been unable to definitively connect him to the murder until recently. A breakthrough came when Holloman's DNA was collected after he spat on the sidewalk last year.</p>

<p>Investigators compared the DNA to samples found under Taylor's fingernails, on a bloody sweatshirt, and a cigarette discovered near her body. The results confirmed a match, leading to Holloman's arrest.</p>

<p>Holloman, who has no prior criminal record, was taken into custody on September 19. His attorney has expressed scepticism about the DNA evidence, suggesting that it might not be conclusive after so many years.</p>

<p>Suffolk County District Attorney Kevin Hayden told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/karen-taylor-1988-murder-boston-james-holloman-dna/" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>CBS News</em></a> that this case exemplifies "superb investigative work by detectives and prosecutors utilizing modern criminological science."&nbsp;</p>

<p>He added, "Most importantly, it provides an opportunity for Karen Taylor's loved ones to see someone held accountable for her death after so many years of unanswered questions."</p>

<p>Taylor was found dead on May 27, 1988, in her apartment in Boston's Roxbury neighbourhood at the age of 25.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Her body was discovered after her mother called the apartment, and Taylor's 3-year-old daughter answered, saying her mom "was sleeping and she couldn't wake her up," according to a statement from the Suffolk County District Attorney's office, reported by WHDH.</p>

<p>The statement further explained, "The mother went to Taylor's apartment at 37 Williams Street in Roxbury but couldn't access the building. She went around to the back and crawled through the window of her daughter's bedroom, where she found her lying face down in a pool of blood."</p>

<p>An autopsy revealed that Taylor had been stabbed 15 times in her chest, head, and neck.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hamas's multipronged attack on southern Israel on October 7 was unprecedented in scale. The panic and confusion it caused made many details of what was happening difficult to establish immediately.</p>

<p>Nearly one year later, the confirmed death count, which includes hostages killed in captivity, now stands at 1,205.</p>

<p>Here is a blow-by-blow timeline of Israel's deadliest day.</p>

<h3><strong>Caught by surprise&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>At 6:29 am (0329 GMT), the Israeli army detected thousands of rockets being fired from the Gaza Strip towards Israeli border communities.</p>

<p>Palestinian militant group Hamas, which rules Gaza, said it had launched some 5,000 projectiles in an offensive dubbed "Operation Al-Aqsa Flood", a reference to the mosque in Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem that is Islam's third-holiest site.</p>

<p>Israel's Iron Dome missile defence system kicked in but was quickly overwhelmed by the amount of incoming fire.</p>

<p>At the same time, Hamas fighters -- the group would later say they numbered 1,200 -- stormed across the border on motorbikes, in pickup trucks and even in motorised paragliders.</p>

<p>They used explosives and bulldozers to break through the fence separating Gaza from Israel and attacked nearly 50 different sites, including kibbutzim communities, army bases and a music festival.</p>

<p>Militants killed festival-goers en masse and went door-to-door in farming communities, shooting residents dead in their homes.</p>

<p>In March, a United Nations report acknowledged there were "reasonable grounds to believe" that rapes were committed during the attack. It also found "clear and convincing information" that some hostages taken on that day had been raped.</p>

<h3><strong>Slow army response</strong></h3>

<p>By 8:30 am, the militants had stormed six military bases: Erez at the northern end of the Gaza Strip, Nahal Oz opposite Gaza City, two others near the Beeri kibbutz, one in Reim near central Gaza and two in the south close to the Egyptian border.</p>

<p>Residents of kibbutzim near Gaza were forced to fight the attackers on their own for hours, as the military was slow to come to their aid.</p>

<p>They would later describe cowering in safe rooms as militants tried to break down the doors, or taking whatever arms they had and rushing out to try to repel the assault.</p>

<p>At the Nova music festival, where nearly 3,000 people had gathered in fields and woods a few kilometres (miles) from central Gaza, militants went on an hour-long rampage that killed at least 370 people.</p>

<p>In kibbutz Beeri, one of the worst-hit communities, the first individual Israeli reinforcements came to help "from 13:30 onwards", an army report later said.</p>

<p>A full army division arrived at 4:15 pm to organise a coordinated evacuation of survivors and retake control of the kibbutz.</p>

<p>The military announced at around 6:00 pm that both soldiers and civilians had been seized by Hamas attackers and taken into Gaza.</p>

<h3><strong>Taken as hostages&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>A total of 251 people in Israel were taken hostage on October 7, including 44 from the Nova festival and at least 74 from kibbutz Nir Oz.</p>

<p>Some, including soldiers, were already dead and their bodies were taken into Gaza, the army has said.</p>

<p>Some hostages may have fallen to friendly fire, including in kibbutz Beeri, where witnesses told Israeli media a tank fired at a house in which 14 people were being held by Hamas.</p>

<p>The order may have been an instance of the "Hannibal Directive", which Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported was applied at least three times that day.</p>

<p>This measure allows for the use of force to prevent soldiers from being captured.</p>

<h3><strong>'We are at war'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>At 11:34 am, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu delivered an almost unprecedented televised address on the rest day of Shabbat, declaring: "We are at war."</p>

<p>In the afternoon, the military called up 360,000 reservists to bolster an army that otherwise boasts 170,000 personnel, a mix of those performing mandatory service and career soldiers.</p>

<p>Israel quickly began a relentless bombardment of Gaza, the tiny Palestinian coastal territory home to 2.4 million people that has been ruled by Hamas since 2007.</p>

<p>An AFP journalist reported the first strike in Gaza at 10:39 am that day. Since then, the territory has been devastated by relentless air strikes.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory military offensive since October 7 has killed at least 41,431 people in Gaza, a majority of them civilians, according to data provided by the Hamas-run territory's health ministry. The United Nations has called the figures reliable.</p>

<p>As night fell on October 7, the search continued for any gunmen still inside Israel, with terrified civilians locked inside their homes and many streets deserted.</p>

<p>On October 10, the military said it had taken back control of all territory attacked by the militants.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kate Middleton made her first public appearance on Sunday after completing her chemotherapy. The 42-year-old royal, accompanied by her husband Prince William, attended a church service with King Charles III and Queen Camilla near their Balmoral estate in Scotland.</p>

<p>In photos published by <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/royals/30589432/princess-kate-spotted-first-time-finished-chemotherapy/ ">The Sun</a>, Kate was seen in the passenger seat of a car driven by the Prince of Wales, who wore a navy suit and blue tie for the occasion.&nbsp;It marked her return to public duties after a period of absence due to cancer treatment.</p>

<p>On September 9, the Princess of Wales shared that she finished her chemotherapy six months after being diagnosed with an undisclosed type of cancer. Her revelation came just weeks after Buckingham Palace announced that King Charles III was also undergoing cancer treatment. In her announcement, Kate stated that she was optimistic about her recovery, adding her journey to complete health would be gradual, with plans to participate in limited engagements through the end of the year.</p>

<p>“The last nine months have been incredibly tough for us as a family,” Kate shared in <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/kate-middleton-finishes-chemotherapy-course-says-cant-tell-what-a-relief-6527477 ">a video</a>. “Life as you know it can change in an instant, and we have had to find a way to navigate the stormy waters. The cancer journey is complex, scary and unpredictable for everyone, especially those closest to you. It brings a new perspective on everything.”</p>

<p>Earlier this week, Princess Kate quietly resumed her royal duties. For the first time since March, the Princess of Wales held a private meeting with team members from Kensington Palace and the Centre for Early Childhood at Windsor Castle.</p>

<p>Despite stepping away from most royal duties during her treatment, Kate made two public appearances earlier in the year. In June, she participated in the <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/in-pics-kate-middleton-military-parade-and-a-celebration-at-buckingham-5897094#:~:text=Kate%20Middleton%2C%20along%20with%20Princess,since%20her%20cancer%20diagnosis%20announcement">Trooping the Colour military parade</a> on King Charles' birthday. The Princess also attended the men's final at Wimbledon in July, receiving a <a href="http://https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/kate-middleton-receives-standing-ovation-at-wimbledon-final-in-rare-outing-since-cancer-diagnosis-6108590 ">standing ovation</a> from the crowd.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Israel and Hezbollah have threatened to intensify their cross-border attacks, disregarding calls from the international community to de-escalate and step back from a potential all-out war.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<ol>
	<li>Hezbollah's deputy chief, Naim Qassem, issued a defiant message that the group has entered "a new phase" in its confrontation with Israel. Qassem made his remarks following Israeli strikes on northern Lebanon that targeted Hezbollah strongholds, resulting in widespread damage and numerous casualties.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant reiterated Israel's commitment to ensuring the security of its northern residents, stating, "Military actions will continue until we reach a point where we may ensure the safe return of Israel's northern communities to their homes." As both sides harden their stances, Army Chief Lieutenant General Herzi Halevi vowed that Israel would "hit anyone who threatens" its citizens.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>The United States, Israel's biggest ally, has urged restraint. President Joe Biden emphasised that military escalation is not in Israel's "best interest" and that the US is working tirelessly to prevent a broader conflict. "We're going to do everything we can to keep a wider war from breaking out," Biden said.</li>
	<li>United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres echoed similar concerns, warning of the risk of Lebanon becoming "another Gaza" amid the ongoing Gaza conflict.</li>
	<li>Over the weekend, Hezbollah launched a barrage of rockets that reached Kiryat Bialik near Haifa, Israel's largest northern city, damaging infrastructure and igniting fears of further escalation. In retaliation, Israel struck Hezbollah targets in southern Lebanon, including an airbase and military production facilities. The exchange of fire led Israel's civil defence agency to order schools in the north to shut down.</li>
	<li>Lebanon's health ministry reported that three people were killed in Israeli strikes on southern areas, while Hezbollah confirmed that two of its fighters were killed. The Israeli army reported that over 150 rockets, missiles, and drones were fired into its territory overnight from Lebanon.</li>
	<li>Israel's recent airstrikes, including an attack on the densely populated Dahiyeh neighbourhood in Beirut, killed Ibrahim Aqil, head of Hezbollah's elite Radwan Force.</li>
	<li>Hezbollah has signalled that it will not be deterred, with Qassem stating that the group is prepared to face "all military possibilities." This comes as Israel continues to target Hezbollah's military infrastructure, attempting to prevent the group from expanding its influence along the Israeli-Lebanese border.</li>
	<li>Despite mediation efforts led by Qatar, Egypt, and the United States, the conflict shows no sign of abating. Attempts to secure a ceasefire and facilitate hostage release have stalled, with Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty indicating that the situation between Israel and Hezbollah is negatively affecting efforts to stabilize Gaza.</li>
	<li>The United Nations has described the situation as being "on the brink of an imminent catastrophe."&nbsp;</li>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A man's bold decision to get the Monster Energy Drink logo tattooed across his chest has sparked amusement online. The tattoo, featuring the company's recognisable large "M" symbol, was shared on social media platform X. The image showed the surrounding skin red and inflamed, indicating the ink was freshly done.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The tattoo drew attention for its size, as the large "M" – designed to resemble three claw marks – was placed prominently on the man's chest, covering much of the space. While the man seemed proud of his new ink, Monster Energy's response on social media was far from enthusiastic.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The energy drink company replied to the viral post with a humorous comment, saying, “Kinda wish we never saw this.”&nbsp;</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A man who was abducted as a six-year-old boy over 70 years ago has been found alive on the East Coast of the United States. Luis Armando Albino disappeared on February 21, 1951, from a park in West Oakland, California. He was lured away by a woman who promised to buy him sweets while he played with his 10-year-old brother, Roger. For decades, his whereabouts remained a mystery, until this year, when DNA testing and family efforts revealed the truth.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2024/09/20/oakland-boy-kidnapped-1951-found-alive-new-york/ ">Mercury News</a> first reported the discovery, which came after Mr Albino's niece, Alida Alequin, set on a quest to find her uncle. Using DNA testing, newspaper clippings and help from the Oakland Police Department, FBI and Department of Justice, Ms Alequin, a 63-year-old Oakland resident, tracked her uncle down. Luis Albino He is now a retired firefighter and Marine Corps veteran, having served two tours in Vietnam.</p>

<p>In June, Mr Albino, now 79, was reunited with emotional family members, including his older brother, Roger, who died from cancer last month at the age of 82. The brothers shared a heartwarming reunion before Mr Roger's death, with Alida Alequin describing the moment, “They grabbed each other and had a really tight, long hug. They sat down and just talked."</p>

<p>Ms search began in 2020 when she casually took an online DNA test. The results revealed a 22 per cent match with Albino, leading her to dig deeper into family history. Along with her daughters, Ms Alequin sifted through newspaper archives and microfilm at local libraries, ultimately finding pictures of Luis Albino that confirmed her suspicions. Her determination was key to solving the decades-old mystery.</p>

<p>Mr Albino recalls parts of his abduction and journey to the East Coast but shared that those around him at the time refused to provide answers. Now, he prefers to keep some of his experiences private.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Unfortunately, their mother, who died in 2005 at the age of 92, never lived to see the mystery solved.</p>

<p>Ms Alequin described Roger's final days as peaceful. She said he "died happily" and was "at peace with himself, knowing his brother had been found."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the CEO of OpenAI, a leader in developing artificial intelligence (AI) tools, Sam Altman is no stranger to taking risks. In 2005, he made a career-defining decision by dropping out of Stanford to create Loopt, a location-based social networking app. This move ultimately led him to co-found OpenAI, the organization behind ChatGPT.</p>

<p>"It seemed like a really fun thing to try," the 39-year-old explained during an interview with students at his alma mater, John Burroughs School in the St. Louis area, as reported by <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/17/openai-ceo-sam-altmans-his-no-1-strategy-for-living-without-regrets.html" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>CNBC Make It</em></a>. Altman noted that he was willing to take the risk because he could always return to his studies if entrepreneurship didn't pan out.</p>

<p>"That's the key to most risk, is most things are not a one-way door," Altman said. "You can try something, it doesn't work out, you can undo it, you can do something else." It's important to take the right risks but that doesn't mean that one should avoid taking them altogether, he added. "The risky thing is not to go try the things that might really work out" because regret can kick in, the OpenAI boss said. "You kind of look back at your career 10, 20, 30 years later and say, 'Man, I wish I had tried the thing I really wanted to try. You should just put a huge premium on doing that anytime you feel like you might say that later."</p>

<p>Mr Altman also encouraged students and young professionals to be open to deviating from a traditional path of going to college, getting a job and staying there "forever." He said that that might have been a guarantee of financial security for some people in previous generations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Now I think the traditional path is, I won't say falling apart, but it's quite challenged," he said. "And AI will probably disrupt things even more and put more variants in the traditional path."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Sunday arrived in the United States for a crucial visit to present Kyiv's plan to end two and a half years of war with Russia.</p>

<p>Zelensky will present his proposals -- which he calls a "victory plan" -- to President Joe Biden, as well as presidential hopefuls Kamala Harris and Donald Trump.</p>

<p>The visit comes after a summer of intense fighting: with Moscow advancing fast in eastern Ukraine and Kyiv holding on to swathes of Russia's Kursk region.</p>

<p>It also comes as Kyiv has for weeks pressed the West to allow it to use long-range weapons to strike targets deep inside Russia -- so far to no avail.</p>

<p>When they meet at the White House on Thursday, Zelensky is expected to try to convince Biden to change his mind.</p>

<p>On the first leg of his US visit, Ukraine's president visited a factory in Pennsylvania on Sunday that produces badly needed 155mm artillery shells.</p>

<p>"I began my visit to the United States by expressing my gratitude to all the employees at the plant," Zelensky said Sunday in a post on X, formerly Twitter.</p>

<p>The post included photos of him shaking hands with workers at the plant, where he said production had been ramped up.</p>

<p>"It is in places like this where you can truly feel that the democratic world can prevail," he wrote.</p>

<p>He will next travel to New York and Washington.</p>

<p>Zelensky said the coming weeks would decide how more than 30 months of fighting that has killed thousands would end.</p>

<p>"It is now being determined what the legacy of the current generation of state leaders will be. Those in the highest offices," he said.</p>

<p>In comments before his trip, Zelensky said the United States and UK have not given Ukraine permission to use the long-range weapons as they fear escalation, but hinted he had not given up hope.</p>

<p>"We have had some decisions in the history of our relationship with Biden -- very interesting and difficult dialogues," Zelensky said earlier this week, adding: "He later changed his point of view."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Moscow has said it considers such a go-ahead as NATO countries being "at war" with Russia.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>'Fair and stable peace'&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>A close adviser to Biden said this month that the US leader would use his remaining time in office to "put Ukraine in the best possible position to prevail."&nbsp;</p>

<p>No details on Ukraine's plan have been made public.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Zelensky said Biden would be the first foreign leader to see the plan "in full" -- saying it will then also be presented to "all leaders of our partner countries."</p>

<p>Zelensky plans to present the proposals to the US Congress, Harris and Trump. The White House has said he will meet with Democratic Vice President Harris separately from Biden, and Zelensky has said he expects to meet with Republican Trump on Thursday or Friday.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Harris has indicated she would continue Biden's policies on Ukraine, while Trump has been hugely critical of Washington's massive aid packages for Kyiv.</p>

<p>Zelensky said earlier this week that the plan envisages that "war will not return to us again in an even bigger wave" in years to come.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He has said Kyiv plans to hold meetings throughout autumn and that the "entire plan" will be ready by "early November."</p>

<p>The proposals, he told the media Friday, envisage "quick and concrete steps by our strategic partners."&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>'Clear place for Ukraine'&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>One of those steps, he said, is "related to strengthening Ukraine's weapons capabilities" while another demands a "clear place for Ukraine in the world's security architecture".&nbsp;</p>

<p>Zelensky has also said he plans to invite Russia to a possible second international peace summit in November.</p>

<p>But Moscow this weekend said it would not attend and referred to President Vladimir Putin's conditions to enter talks: that Ukraine surrender four of its regions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I think both are still betting on the possibility of a military victory," UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres told CNN Sunday.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Russian attacks on Ukraine killed six people -- including two children -- this weekend, while a strike on the city of Kharkiv wounded 21 people in a residential neighbourhood.</p>

<p>Ukraine said it struck two arms depots in Russia, with Kyiv's army saying it hit a key ammunition storage base important to the Russian army's logistics for its invasion.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.mea.gov.in/press-releases.htm?dtl/38332/Prime_Minister_attends_the_CEOs_Roundtable" target="_blank">said in a statement </a>that the roundtable focused on cutting-edge sectors, including Artificial Intelligence (AI), quantum computing, biotechnology, and semiconductor technologies.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>SpaceX plans to launch about five uncrewed Starship missions to Mars in two years, CEO Elon Musk said on Sunday in a post on social media platform X.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, Musk had said that the first Starships to Mars would launch in two years "when the next Earth-Mars transfer window opens."</p>

<p>On Sunday, the CEO said that the first crewed mission timeline would depend upon the success of the uncrewed flights. If the uncrewed missions land safely, crewed missions will be launched in four years. However, in case of challenges, crewed missions will be postponed by another two years, Musk said.</p>

<p>Musk, known for providing changing timelines on Starship's readiness, said earlier this year that the first uncrewed starship to land on Mars would be within five years, with the first people landing on Mars within seven years.</p>

<p>In June, a Starship rocket survived a fiery, hypersonic return from space and achieved a breakthrough landing demonstration in the Indian Ocean, completing a full test mission around the globe on the rocket's fourth try.</p>

<p>Musk is counting on Starship to fulfil his goal of producing a large, multipurpose next-generation spacecraft capable of sending people and cargo to the moon later this decade, and ultimately flying to Mars.</p>

<p>NASA earlier this year delayed Artemis 3 mission and its first crewed moon landing in half a century using SpaceX's Starship, to September 2026. It was previously planned for late 2025, NASA said.</p>

<p>Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa in June cancelled a private mission around the moon he had paid for, which was to have used SpaceX's Starship, citing schedule uncertainties in the rocket's development.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi held a bilateral meeting with Kuwait Crown Prince, Sheikh Sabah Khaled Al-Hamad Al-Sabah Al-Sabah, in New York on Sunday (local time).</p>

<p>Prior to this, PM Modi also held a bilateral meeting with Nepali Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli.</p>

<p>"The meeting was very good," PM Oli told ANI after his meeting with PM Modi.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar met Kuwait's Foreign Minister Abdullah Ali Al-Yahya and discussed strengthening India-Kuwait bilateral relations.</p>

<p>India and Kuwait enjoy traditionally friendly relations, which are rooted in history and have stood the test of time. India has been a natural trading partner of Kuwait and until 1961, Indian Rupee was a legal tender in Kuwait.</p>

<p>The year 2021-22 marked the 60th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries.</p>

<p>India was one of the first countries to establish diplomatic relations with Kuwait following its independence from British Protectorate in 1961. Prior to the establishment of diplomatic relations, India was represented by a Trade Commissioner.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Republican Donald Trump said that he will not make a fourth consecutive run for the U.S. presidency if he loses the Nov. 5 election, saying "that will be it" in an interview released on Sunday.</p>

<p>Asked if he saw himself running again in four years if he is not successful in his third consecutive bid for the White House, the 78-year-old former president told Sharyl Attkisson's "Full Measure" program: "No I don't. I think that will be — that will be it. I don't see that at all. Hopefully, we will be successful."</p>

<p>Trump faces a tight race against Democratic U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris, with polls showing the two neck-and-neck in key battleground states that are likely to be decisive in determining the winner, even as Harris has begun to edge up in nationwide polls.</p>

<p>Trump launched his first reelection bid for the 2020 election the same day he was inaugurated in 2017 and announced his latest White House bid two years ago in November 2022.</p>

<p>Trump has continued to falsely blame his 2020 loss to Democratic President Joe Biden on widespread voter fraud and faces federal and state criminal charges over efforts to overturn the election results. He denies any wrongdoing and has cast his indictments as a political attack against him while embracing increasingly dystopian rhetoric if he were to lose in 2024.</p>

<p>He has also launched a number of businesses ventures amid his latest campaign, including Trump Media, NFTs, and Trump branded sneakers, coins and crypto.</p>

<p>Harris, 59, meanwhile, has cast the race as a critical moment for U.S. democracy even as she seeks to focus on kitchen-table issues such as costs for families and housing.</p>

<p>Asked whether the four year break helped him regroup and figure out who he could trust as allies, Trump said: "It would have been easier if I did it ... contiguous."</p>

<p>"But the benefit is more than anything else, it shows how bad they were," he added.</p>

<p>Trump, who spoke with Attkisson at his Florida resort, also said it was "too early" to make deals with people for any position in his White House cabinet should he win in November.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi today highlighted the growing stature of India at the global platform and said that "the world listens when India speaks."</p>

<p>Addressing the Indian diaspora in New York, PM Modi said, "We are also a strong voice of the Global South. Today, when India says something on a global platform, the world listens. Some time ago when I said that this is not the era of war, its severity was understood by all..."</p>

<p>This vision was recently exemplified through the Voice of Global South Summit, hosted by India in January 2023. The summit, themed "Unity of Voice, Unity of Purpose," brought together leaders from the Global South to discuss shared challenges and opportunities. By providing a platform for these nations to unite and speak with one voice, India demonstrated its commitment to fostering cooperation and driving positive change.</p>

<p>He said that for India, power and potency means - "knowledge is for sharing, wealth is for caring, power is for protecting."</p>

<p>By hosting the Voice of Global South Summit and promoting unity among developing nations, India has reaffirmed its position as a key player on the global stage. As PM Modi emphasised, when India speaks, the world listens - a testament to India's increasing influence and leadership in shaping a more equitable and prosperous world.</p>

<p>PM Modi said that now India does not lag behind, it creates new systems and leads. India has given the new concept of digital public infrastructure (DPI) to the world.</p>

<p>"Today our partnership is growing with the whole world. Earlier, India followed the policy of equidistance. Today, India follows the policy of equidistance. Today, India's 5G market has become bigger than America, and this has happened in just two years. Now India is working on 'Made in India' 6G," said PM Modi.</p>

<p>He said that now India is a land of opportunities. "Now, India doesn't wait for the opportunities, it creates them," the PM asserted.</p>

<p>Speaking about the sea changes brought in last decade regarding opportunities and bringing 25 crore people out of poverty, PM Modi said, "In the last ten years, India has created opportunities for new launching pads in every sector. In just a decade, 25 crore people were lifted out of poverty. This was possible because we changed the old thoughts and approach. We focussed on empowering the poor. We connected more than 50 crores with the banking system..."</p>

<p>"In a decade, India has become the 5th largest economy from the 10th position. Now every Indian wants that India should soon become the 3rd largest economy. Today, India is a land of opportunities. Now India does not wait for opportunities, it creates opportunities," PM Modi added.</p>

<p>Regarding the demographic dividend, the PM said, "Today, India is one of the youngest countries in the world. India is filled with energy and dreams. Every day, new records and news are being made. Today, India has won gold in the Chess Olympiad (Men and Women). This has happened for the first time in a century. Our entire country is proud of our chess players. We have AI driving India, and the other AI - Aspirational India - is a new force driving the growth of Indians."</p>

<p>He also set goals for Modi 3.0, moving ahead with three times the power and strength asked the people remember the word 'PUSHP'. P-Progressive Bharat, U-Unstoppable Bharat, S-Spiritual Bharat, H-Bharat committed to Humanity and P-Prosperous Bharat</p>

<p>"We will build Viksit Bharat, combining the five petals of PUSHP," added PM Modi.</p>

<p>Regarding the conflict ongoing around the world, the PM said, "This 2024 is crucial for the entire world. On one hand, there is conflict and tension among some countries. In some countries, however, there is a celebration of democracy."</p>

<p>He further said that India's priority is not to increase its pressence in the world but to increase its impact.</p>

<p>'"Hum aaag ki tarah jalaane waale nahin, Suraj ki kiran ki tarah roshani dene waale hain'. We don't want our supremacy in the world, but to increase cooperation in the prosperity of the world," said PM Modi</p>

<p>The Prime Minister said that India and America are together in this celebration of democracy.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden and Prime Minister Narendra Modi hailed a watershed arrangement to set up a semiconductor fabrication plant focused on advanced sensing, communication, and power electronics for national security, next generation telecommunications, and green energy applications.</p>

<p>The plant (or fab), which will be built with the objective of manufacturing infrared, gallium nitride and silicon carbide semiconductors, will be enabled by support from the India Semiconductor Mission as well as a strategic technology partnership between Bharat Semi, 3rdiTech, and the US Space Force.</p>

<p>In a historic moment, the first ever National security Fab in India is announced as a technology partnership between Indian businesses Bharat Semi, 3rdiTech and US space force. This is the first ever India-US Semiconductor Fab cooperation of its kind.</p>

<p>It's for the first time the US military has agreed to do a technology partnership for these highly valued technologies with India, so it's a watershed moment as powerful as the civil nuclear deal.</p>

<p>The fab becomes not only India's first, but one of the world's first multi-material fab for national security. The Bharat Semi fab titled Shakti also became one of the first fabs of its kind in the Quad. The Fab will focus on three essential pillars for the modern warfighting - advanced sensing, advanced communications and high-voltage power electronics.</p>

<p>These three areas have huge growing needs for commercial sectors such as railways, telecom infrastructure, data centres and green energy. These semiconductors fall under a family known as 'compound semiconductors'.</p>

<h2><strong>THREE MAIN TECHNOLOGY AREAS</strong></h2>

<p>The three main technology areas are infrared, galium nitride, and silicon carbide. It is part of PM Modi's vision for India to become a chipmaker from a chip-taker. This fab will become a national asset and further help India's goals of becoming a net security provider in the region.</p>

<p>For a country to become a net security provider it needs to become a net technology provider. This is a glass ceiling that has been broken in tech diplomacy and years down the road it will be seen in history as a watershed moment in India-US relationship.</p>

<p>India's current import bill in these semiconductors for national security alone is $1 Billion a year. India and the US have signed multiple cooperation deals focused on critical tech with a special focus on semiconductors, from iCET to commerce to commerce MOU to the strategic trade dialogue.</p>

<p>This becomes the first true India US semiconductor fab project. Other projects in the past have included testing and assembly OSAT. But this is raising the game and going into true chip fabrication - the holy grail of semiconductors.</p>

<p>After this technology partnership, India will join a handful of elite nations with the capability and knowhow to manufacture these types of semiconductors on shore.</p>

<p>Bharat Semi and 3rdiTech are a true iCET success story and a true success story of PM Modi's Atmnanirbhar vision From the launch of iCET in January 2023 to building India's first compound semiconductor fab for national security.</p>

<p>This is history in the making as Bharat Semi and 3rdiTech emerge as national champions and truly the first Indian homegrown semiconductor integrated design and manufacturing company (IDM).<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday (local time) highlighted the relationship between India and the US in terms of artificial intelligence and gave a new meaning to it, describing it as the America-India spirit.</p>

<p>Addressing the Indian community at Nassau Coliseum in New York, Long Island at 'Modi&amp;US' Event, he said, "For the world, AI means artificial intelligence, but for me, AI also means American-Indian spirit. This is the new 'AI' power of the world....I salute the Indian diaspora here."</p>

<p>PM Modi said that Indian community has always been the country's strongest brand ambassadors.</p>

<p>"I have always understood your potential... the potential of the Indian diaspora. You have always been India's strongest band ambassador for me. That's why I call all of you 'Rashtradoot'."</p>

<p>"Now Apna Namaste has also become multinational. It has gone from local to global and you have done all this. Every Indian who keeps India in his heart has done this. You have connected India with America and America with India. Your skill, talent, and commitment are unmatched. Despite being overseas, no ocean can separate you from India," PM Modi added.</p>

<p>He also praised the Indian community for keeping up the tradition of "Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam" that means "the world is one family."</p>

<p>"Wherever we go, we treat everyone as family and mingle with them. Understanding diversity, living it, implementing it in our lives... it is in our values. Someone speaks Tamil... someone Telugu, someone Malayalam, someone Kannada... someone Punjabi, someone Marathi, someone Gujarati... There are many languages, but the feeling is one... and that feeling is - Indianness," said PM Modi.</p>

<p>Speaking on the diversity of India, PM Modi said, "We are residents of a country where there are hundreds of languages and dialects, all the religions and sects of the world. Still, we are moving ahead united and noble. This is our biggest strength to connect with the world. These values naturally bind us to the world."</p>

<p>Praising the Indian community for their talent and skill, he said that they connect India to America.</p>

<p>"You have connected India to America and America to India. Your skill, talent, and commitment have no competition. You might have come seven seas apart, but no sea has that much depth that it can distance you from India. What Ma Bharati has taught us, we can never forget that. Wherever we go, we accept all as family. To understand diversity, to live diversity is in our veins," said PM Modi.</p>

<p>America and India are poised to become AI powerhouses in the new world, and Prime Minister Modi's recent visit to the US has strengthened this partnership.</p>

<p>During his address at the Quad Leaders' Summit, PM Modi emphasized that the group is a "force of Global Good" that will contribute to the betterment of the world.</p>

<p>The US-India partnership has made significant strides in AI research and development. The Initiative on Critical and Emerging Technology (iCET) has facilitated cooperation in key areas like space, semiconductors, and advanced telecommunications.</p>

<p>The two nations are also collaborating on the development of small modular reactor technologies and exploring opportunities to expand cooperation in solar, wind, and nuclear energy.</p>

<p>The Indian community gave a standing ovation to PM Modi, as he entered the event venue, and took the stage. Talented artists from the Indian community took the stage, setting the perfect tone for PM Modi's imminent address to the Indian diaspora in the US.</p>

<p>PM Modi's address at "Modi and US" program is a historic event which is unfolding at the Nassau Coliseum in Long Island, New York, as 15,000 members of the Indian community gather from 42 different states to welcome the Prime Minister.</p>

<p>Later in the day, PM Modi will chair key bilateral meetings in New York and attend a CEO Roundtable in addition he will also address the Summit of the Future on September 23.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

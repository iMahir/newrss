       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United Nations said pager explosions that killed nine people and wounded 2,800 across Lebanon Tuesday marked "an extremely concerning escalation" nearly one year into the Gaza war.</p>

<p>"The developments today mark an extremely concerning escalation in what is an already unacceptably volatile context," UN special coordinator for Lebanon Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert said in a statement.</p>

<p>She urged "all concerned actors to refrain from any further action, or bellicose rhetoric, which could trigger a wider conflagration that nobody can afford".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris called on Tuesday for an end to the Israel-Gaza war and said that Israel must not reoccupy the Palestinian enclave once the nearly year-old conflict comes to an end.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris called on Tuesday for an end to the Israel-Gaza war and said that Israel must not reoccupy the Palestinian enclave once the nearly year-old conflict comes to an end.</p>

<p>Speaking in Philadelphia to the National Association of Black Journalists, she called for a ceasefire between Israel and Palestinian Hamas militants, a two-state solution and Middle East stability in a way that does not empower Iran.</p>

<p>"We've made ourselves very clear this deal needs to get done in the best interest of everyone in the region," Harris, the U.S. vice president, said in response to questions asked by three journalists.</p>

<p>At least 41,252 people have been killed and 95,497 wounded in the Israeli offensive in the Hamas-ruled strip since Oct. 7, the Gaza health ministry said. The war began that day when Hamas attacked Israel, killing 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking about 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.</p>

<p>Harris was asked about Springfield, Ohio, a city that for days has found itself at the center of a social media maelstrom after right-wing agitators latched onto false claims that Haitian arrivals were eating household pets.</p>

<p>Former President Donald Trump, Harris' Republican rival in the Nov. 5 presidential election, has pledged to conduct mass deportations of Haitian immigrants from Springfield if elected, even though the majority are in the United States legally.</p>

<p>"This is exhausting and it's harmful and it's hateful and grounded in some age-old stuff that we should not have the tolerance for," Harris said.</p>

<p>The 45-minute interview began with economic issues. Harris said that if elected president she will work with private investors to boost housing supply, acknowledging that more work was needed to lower prices for Americans.</p>

<p>"One of the big issues that affects people right now in terms of the economy and their economic wellbeing is we have a shortage of housing supply," Harris said. "It's too expensive."</p>

<p>Harris reiterated a plan to expand the child tax credit to $6,000. She repeated a pledge that Americans not pay more than 7% of their income on childcare.</p>

<p>The interview was scheduled after Harris did not attend the group's convention in Chicago in July when Trump, in an interview, questioned her Black identity.</p>

<p><strong>HARRIS, TRUMP COURT BLACK VOTERS</strong></p>

<p>In the 2020 presidential election, Black voters supported then-candidate Joe Biden 92% to 8% over the then-incumbent Trump, according to the Pew Research Center. Most Black voters, 63%, plan to support Harris, compared with 13% for Trump, according to an NAACP survey released this month.</p>

<p>However, some Black voters are losing faith in the Democratic Party. Over one quarter of younger Black men say they would support Trump this election, the NAACP poll showed.</p>

<p>"Black men are like any other voting group," Harris said. "You gotta earn their vote."</p>

<p>The interview was conducted by NABJ members from TheGrio and Politico as well as an anchor for WHYY-FM, a public radio station.</p>

<p>Both Harris and Trump have made efforts to win over Black voters, whose support may be decisive in the closely fought Nov. 5 vote, especially in a handful of battleground states such as Pennsylvania and Georgia.</p>

<p>Some forecasters regard Pennsylvania as a must-win state.</p>

<p>In Georgia, an intense battle is being waged for the Black voters who make up a third of the state's population, the biggest proportion of Black voters in any of the seven battleground states.</p>

<p>Trump's attempt to pull in more support from Black voters is complicated by their traditional loyalty to the Democratic Party, his past racist remarks and a history of Republican-backed voting restrictions that activists say make it harder for Black residents to vote. Republicans deny trying to suppress the vote.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A US appeals court on Tuesday upheld Ghislaine Maxwell's conviction for helping the disgraced late financier Jeffrey Epstein sexually abuse teenage girls.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A US appeals court on Tuesday upheld Ghislaine Maxwell's conviction for helping the disgraced late financier Jeffrey Epstein sexually abuse teenage girls.</p>

<p>The decision by the Manhattan-based 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals means the British socialite will remain in a Florida prison, where she is serving a 20-year sentence.</p>

<p>A lawyer for Maxwell signaled she will appeal the decision to the US Supreme Court.</p>

<p>Maxwell, 62, was convicted in December 2021 on five charges for having recruited and groomed four underage girls for Epstein, her former boyfriend, to abuse between 1994 and 2004.</p>

<p>A three-judge panel rejected Maxwell's claim that Epstein's 2007 agreement with federal prosecutors in southern Florida not to be prosecuted there shielded her from being prosecuted in New York, where she was criminally charged in 2020.</p>

<p>It also rejected Maxwell's claims that her trial was tainted because one juror did not disclose that he had been sexually abused as a child, and that the sentence was too long.</p>

<p>Writing for the panel, Circuit Judge Jose Cabranes found Maxwell's punishment procedurally reasonable.</p>

<p>He cited the trial judge's assessment that the sentence reflected Maxwell's "pivotal role in facilitating the abuse of the underaged girls through a series of deceptive tactics," and the "significant and lasting harm it inflicted."</p>

<p>The scandal has tainted or destroyed the reputations of former friends including Britain's Prince Andrew and onetime Barclays CEO Jes Staley, who worked with Epstein while previously employed at JPMorgan Chase.</p>

<p>Epstein died by suicide at age 66 in 2019 in a Manhattan jail cell, five weeks after being arrested and charged with sex trafficking.</p>

<p>"We are obviously very disappointed by the court's decision and we vehemently disagree with the outcome," Maxwell's lawyer, Arthur Aidala, said in a statement. "We are cautiously optimistic that Ghislaine will get the justice she deserves from the Supreme Court of the United States."</p>

<p><strong>SCAPEGOATING CLAIM</strong></p>

<p>In her appeal, Maxwell argued that references to the "United States" in Epstein's 2007 nonprosecution agreement signaled the government's intent to bar prosecutions nationwide of "potential co-conspirators," including four others named in the agreement.</p>

<p>A prosecutor countered that the mention of the United States was a throwaway reference, and Epstein's agreement was intended to bind only prosecutors in southern Florida.</p>

<p>Cabranes agreed, saying nothing in the agreement's text or negotiation history suggested it bound prosecutors in New York.</p>

<p>Epstein ultimately pleaded guilty in 2008 to a Florida state prosecution charge and served 13 months in jail, an arrangement now widely considered too lenient.</p>

<p>Maxwell also argued in her appeal that prosecutors scapegoated her because Epstein was dead and the public demanded that someone else be held accountable.</p>

<p>Tuesday's decision did not address that argument.</p>

<p>Since Epstein died, his victims have recouped hundreds of millions of dollars from his estate, as well as from JPMorgan Chase and Deutsche Bank, which they accused of handling transactions that financed his misconduct.</p>

<p>Sigrid McCawley, a lawyer for dozens of Epstein accusers, called Tuesday's decision "another step towards justice."</p>

<p>Maxwell is serving her sentence in a low-security prison in Tallahassee, Florida. She is eligible for release in July 2037.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JPMorgan Chase is in talks with Apple about replacing Goldman Sachs as the tech giant's credit-card partner, a source familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.</p>

<p>The discussions started earlier this year and have advanced in recent weeks, but any potential deal could still be months away, said the source, who asked not to be named because the discussions are private.</p>

<p>The Wall Street Journal reported the news earlier.</p>

<p>Goldman Sachs declined to comment, while Apple did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Goldman and Apple reportedly pulled the plug last year on their partnership, which included credit cards and savings accounts.</p>

<p>Goldman is facing a costly exit from the partnership that is seen by other lenders as too risky and unprofitable, sources told Reuters in December last year.</p>

<p>After its foray into consumer banking flopped, Goldman has refocused on its traditional mainstays - investment banking and trading. The consumer business that CEO David Solomon championed has lost billions of dollars.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The card, launched in 2019, was one of the hallmarks of Goldman's retail strategy. Apple and Goldman granted cards to customers with lower credit scores in an attempt to boost revenue, a source told Reuters last year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The card offered perks like "no fees" and cashback. But Goldman had to set aside bigger provisions for bad loans, leading to higher paper losses for its consumer business.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Goldman is also exiting a credit-card partnership with automaker General Motors. Earlier this month, Solomon dismissed the notion that the bank's early exit with GM was messy, saying the bank had anticipated the problems.</p>

<p>Investors have supported Goldman's attempt to refocus on its Wall Street operations, pushing its stock up nearly 27% so far this year.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>India has sent a second tranche of relief supplies to Myanmar under its Operation Sadbhav, which was launched two days ago to help Southeast Asian countries deal with Typhoon Yagi.</p>

<p>Massive floods have wreaked destruction in various parts of Myanmar, Laos and Vietnam after Typhoon Yagi, said to be Asia's most powerful storm this year, struck the three countries.</p>

<p>Typhoon Yagi is named after the Japanese word for goat and the constellation of Capricornus.</p>

<p>In Myanmar, the typhoon has caused the loss of hundreds of lives, massive destruction of property and has affected lakhs of people.</p>

<p>India sent the 32-tonne consignment of relief materials to Myanmar today on an IL-76 transport aircraft of the Indian Air Force, the Ministry of External Affairs said.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A centuries-old mystery surrounding a poet buried in Notre Dame in Paris could be close to being solved thanks to archeological digs at the world-famous cathedral, researchers said on Tuesday.</p>

<p>The exact whereabouts of the tomb of Joachim de Bellay, a French Renaissance poet, has puzzled researchers for many years.</p>

<p>De Bellay, a member of a literary group known as La Pleiade, died aged 37 in 1560.</p>

<p>His family asked for him to be buried in Notre Dame's Saint-Crepin chapel. But when the site was renovated in 1758, no trace of his remains could be found.</p>

<p>His remains' precise location was shrouded in mystery until 2022 when archeologists, sifting through the site in the aftermath of the 2019 fire that destroyed much of Notre Dame, found two tombs at the cathedral's crossing.</p>

<p>The scientists, working for the national institute for preventative archeology, rapidly identified one of them as that of Antoine de La Porte, a cleric who died in the early 1700s.</p>

<p>But they could not immediately figure out who was buried in the other one.</p>

<p>Using modern methods of analysis, the researchers began to find clues as to his possibly identity. All pointed to de Bellay.</p>

<p>A deformation of his iliac bone told them that he did a lot of horse-riding.</p>

<p>De Bellay "was a skilled rider, he went from Paris to Rome on horseback", Eric Cubrezy, a doctor and archeologist, told reporters.</p>

<p>In addition, an incision made by a saw in the corpse's skull, as well as a broken sternum, suggested the body had undergone an autopsy before being embalmed -- just like de Bellay.</p>

<p>The final, and most telling, clue wase traces of a rare illness, a bone tubercoulosis leading to chronic meningitis, consistent with the poet's medical history.</p>

<p>French daily Le Monde, describing the mystery around the missing corpse as "a cold case", said the latest find was the "most spectacular result" of the Notre Dame digs launched after the 2019 catastrophic fire.</p>

<p>The archeologists themselves preferred to remain cautious.</p>

<p>"There are still some doubts," said Christophe Besnier, one of the scientists in charge of the excavation site.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The world's oldest Sunday newspaper, The Observer, could be sold to an online startup media group, its owner of more than 30 years announced Tuesday.</p>

<p>The Guardian Media Group said in a statement that it is in talks to offload the weekly publication for an undisclosed amount to Tortoise Media, launched in 2019.</p>

<p>GMG added that a sale would see The Guardian, its flagship title, remain a 24/7 online offering but with greater global reach and funding by its readers.</p>

<p>"The Guardian's parent company has announced that it is in formal negotiations with Tortoise Media over the potential sale of The Observer, the world's oldest Sunday newspaper," a statement said Tuesday.</p>

<p>GMG said the offer "was significant enough to look at in more detail".</p>

<p>GMG chief executive Anna Bateson said a sale "provides a chance to build The Observer's future position with a significant investment and allow The Guardian to focus on its growth strategy to be more global, more digital and more reader-funded".</p>

<p>Founded in 1791, The Observer was bought by GMG in 1993.</p>

<p>"Since then it has coexisted with the Guardian, which will remain a seven-day-a-week digital operation regardless of the outcome of the negotiations," the parent group added Tuesday.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi will be on a three-day official visit to the United States from September 21-24 to attend the annual Quad Summit and address the 'Summit of the Future' at the UN General Assembly.</p>

<p>The fourth Quad Leaders' Summit, which will be held in Wilmington, Delaware, is being hosted by US President Joe Biden. India will host the next Quad Summit in 2025, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) announced on Tuesday.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Quad meeting, which will also be attended by the leaders of Australia and Japan, will be a farewell meeting for President Biden, who is not running for a second term, and Japan's Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, who is set to resign from his post.</p>

<p>Quad is a diplomatic partnership between four countries--Australia, India, Japan, and the United States. In recent years, Quad Foreign Ministers have met eight times and Quad governments continue to meet and coordinate at all levels.</p>

<p>"Following the request of the US side to host the Quad Summit this year, India has agreed to host the next Quad Summit in 2025. At the Quad Summit, the leaders will review the progress achieved by the Quad over the last one year and set the agenda for the year ahead to assist the countries of the Indo-Pacific region in meeting their development goals and aspirations," the MEA said.</p>

<p>PM Modi will also address the 'Summit of the Future' at the United Nations General Assembly in New York on September 23. The theme of the Summit is 'Multilateral Solutions for a Better Tomorrow'. The PM will also hold bilateral meetings with several world leaders and discuss issues of mutual interest on the sidelines of the summit, the MEA said.</p>

<p>While in New York, the PM will also address a gathering of the Indian community on September 22. He will interact with the CEOs of leading US-based companies to foster greater collaborations between the two countries in areas of AI, quantum computing, semiconductors and biotechnology.</p>

<p>"The Prime Minister is also expected to interact with thought leaders and other stakeholders active in the India-US bilateral landscape," the MEA added.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sean "Diddy" Combs used his fame as one of the biggest names in hip-hop to coerce women into engaging in demeaning sex acts as part of a decades-long scheme of sex trafficking and racketeering, according to a three-count federal indictment unsealed on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Starting in 2009, Combs used his vast media empire including his record label Bad Boy Entertainment to transport women, as well as male sex workers, across state lines to take part in recorded sexual performances called "Freak Offs" in which the music mogul would watch and masturbate, prosecutors said.</p>

<p>The 54-year-old rapper and producer was arrested in Manhattan on Monday night and is expected to appear in court before US Magistrate Judge Robyn Tarnofsky at 2:30 pm EDT (1830 GMT) on Tuesday. Combs could face decades in prison if convicted of the three felony counts he faces: racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking, and transportation to engage in prostitution.</p>

<p>The charges were brought by the office of Manhattan US Attorney Damian Williams, which is seeking to have Combs remain detained pending trial.</p>

<p>Combs enticed women by giving them drugs such as ketamine and ecstasy, financial support, or promises of career support or a romantic relationship, prosecutors said. Combs then used surreptitious recordings of the sex acts as "collateral" to ensure that the women would remain silent, and sometimes displayed weapons to intimidate abuse victims and witnesses, according to the indictment.</p>

<p>"The victims did not believe they could refuse Combs without risking their security or facing more abuse," Williams told a press conference.</p>

<p>The indictment contained no allegation that Combs himself directly engaged in unwanted sexual contact with women, though he was accused of assaulting women by punching them or throwing objects at them.</p>

<p><strong>'A MUSIC ICON'</strong></p>

<p>Marc Agnifilo, a lawyer for Combs, did not immediately respond to a request for comment after the indictment was made public, but on Monday night expressed disappointment with the decision to pursue an "unjust" prosecution of his client.</p>

<p>"Sean 'Diddy' Combs is a music icon, self-made entrepreneur, loving family man, and proven philanthropist who has spent the last 30 years building an empire, adoring his children, and working to uplift the Black community," Agnifilo said on Monday night. "He is an imperfect person, but he is not a criminal."</p>

<p>Combs is the highest-profile person in the music industry to face criminal charges for sexual misconduct since R. Kelly, the R&amp;B singer. Kelly was sentenced to a combined 31 years in prison after being convicted in New York in 2021 and Chicago in 2022 on charges including sex trafficking, racketeering and child sex crimes.</p>

<p>Also known during his career as P. Diddy and Puff Daddy, Combs founded Bad Boy records and is credited with helping turn rappers and R&amp;B singers such as Mary J. Blige, Faith Evans, Notorious B.I.G. and Usher into stars in the 1990s and 2000s.</p>

<p>His career and reputation have been marred over the past year. Last November, his former girlfriend Casandra Ventura, an R&amp;B singer known as Cassie, accused him in a lawsuit of serial physical abuse, sexual slavery and rape during their decade-long relationship. She agreed to an undisclosed settlement one day after suing, even as Combs denied her allegations.</p>

<p>Combs has since faced several other civil lawsuits by women and men who accused him of sexual assault and other misconduct. His lawyers have been fighting those cases in court. Federal agents raided Combs' homes in Los Angeles and Miami Beach, Florida six months ago.</p>

<p><strong>BABY OIL, AR-15 RIFLES</strong></p>

<p>Employees of Combs helped arrange the "Freak Offs" by booking hotel rooms and buying controlled substances and other items used during sex, according to the indictment.</p>

<p>Authorities found drugs and 1,000 bottles of baby oil and lubricant during searches of Combs' homes in Miami, Florida and Los Angeles, along with AR-15 rifles with defaced serial numbers, according to the indictment.</p>

<p>The indictment did not specify how many women were alleged victims of the scheme.</p>

<p>The charges are not Combs' first brush with the law. He was acquitted in March 2001 of bribery and weapons charges in a criminal trial stemming from a nightclub shooting that left three people wounded.</p>

<p>The civil lawsuits that Combs faces include a case filed last week by the singer Dawn Richard, formerly of Danity Kane, who accused him of sexual assault, battery, sex trafficking, gender discrimination and fraud.</p>

<p>Also this month, a Michigan judge ordered Combs to pay a $100 million default judgment to Derrick Lee Smith, who said Combs drugged and sexually assaulted him at a party almost 30 years ago. A lawyer for Combs said he would seek a dismissal.</p>

<p>Combs has also denied claims in a February sex trafficking lawsuit by Rodney "Lil Rod" Jones, who Combs employed as a producer on his 2023 release "The Love Album: Off the Grid."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The suspect in an apparent assassination attempt on US presidential candidate Donald Trump was seen as a liability by some soldiers and volunteers in Ukraine, where he offered to recruit Afghans into the Ukrainian military, a former soldier told Reuters on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Ryan Routh, 58, who was arrested about 40 minutes after the incident on Sunday at one of the former president's Florida golf courses, publicly backed Ukraine and spent time in Kyiv after Russia launched its invasion in 2022.</p>

<p>"He was delusional ... he had this idea that he was the only one who knew how to help Ukraine," Evelyn Aschenbrenner, a former soldier in Ukraine's International Legion, told Reuters via Zoom from Lviv.</p>

<p>Reuters has seen documents confirming Aschenbrenner's Ukrainian military service. The US citizen said they served in an administrative role in the Legion for two years from March 2022.</p>

<p>Ryan Routh had told media outlets in 2023 that he had worked to bring foreign fighters to the Legion, set up in the wake of Russia's February 2022 invasion for foreign nationals who wanted to fight for Ukraine.</p>

<p>Ukraine has said that Ryan Routh never fought for Ukraine in the International Legion or any other military unit.</p>

<p>"We can see from the news reports that the suspect previously publicly supported Ukraine but, look, there are hundreds of millions of people in the United States who support Ukraine and clearly they are a diverse group of individuals," Ukrainian foreign ministry spokesman Heorhii Tykhyi said at a press briefing on Tuesday.</p>

<p>"We urge everyone to refrain from artificially linking the suspect's actions to Ukraine."</p>

<p>In screenshots of messages shared with Reuters by Aschenbrenner, Ryan Routh was asked to stop acting as a recruiter on behalf of Ukraine as he was operating outside established frameworks. He responded angrily.</p>

<p>In one exchange on Signal, Ryan Routh demanded that Aschenbrenner help him get a female Finn who was keen to enlist across the border after she was denied re-entry to Ukraine. When Aschenbrenner said they could not help him, Routh wrote:</p>

<p>"It's cool, I'll tell the world Ukraine does not want help. ... Why the fuck did I come," he wrote.</p>

<p>Aschenbrenner said that all those they knew who came into contact with Ryan Routh would eventually become irritated at his behaviour and come to believe he was potentially damaging Ukraine's cause.</p>

<p>"He sent me a list of ... like five or six thousand Afghan citizens and their names," Aschenbrenner said. It was not clear how Ryan Routh had compiled the list.</p>

<p>When Aschenbrenner told Ryan Routh over WhatsApp messages that he should stop trying to recruit Afghans, he began boasting of his lifestyle in Hawaii and indicated he did not care about Ukraine.</p>

<p>"Point is I am happy and not worried about Ukraine ... Congress is cutting all funding now it seems ... good luck," one message said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A bus carrying Muslim faithful celebrating the birth of Prophet Mohammed crashed in northern Nigeria's Kaduna state, killing at least 25 children, an official told AFP Tuesday.</p>

<p>Organisers of the religious pilgrimage gave a higher count of 40, with 31 injured.</p>

<p>The accident occurred on Sunday when the speeding bus overloaded with young adherents of the Tijjaniyya Sufi order lost control and crashed into a truck in Lere district, Kabiru Nadabo, head of the local office of Nigeria's road safety agency, FRSC, said.</p>

<p>"The bus was overloaded with 63 children and the driver was speeding recklessly when he lost control and rammed into an articulated truck," Nadabo said.</p>

<p>"Fifteen of them died on the spot while 48 injured were taken to various hospitals, among which 10 died the following day, raising the death toll to 25," he said.</p>

<p>The children were from Kwandare village and heading to the nearby town of Saminaka for the annual Maulud festivities marking the birth of the Prophet, said Nadabo.</p>

<p>He said the death count could have changed since the injured were taken to hospitals in various locations and he did not get further updates.</p>

<p>Dikko Dahiru, one of the organisers of the trip, said 40 children were killed in the accident, while 31 were injured.</p>

<p>"The bus was carrying 71 passengers and 36 died instantly while four more died in hospital the next day," said Dahiru, whose nephew was among the dead.</p>

<p>"Thirty-one were taken to hospitals with severe injuries, 11 of them in critical condition," he said.</p>

<p>Nigerian President Bola Ahmed Tinubu offered his condolences to the victims' families and those injured, adding that he had "prayed for the repose of the souls of the departed".</p>

<p>In a statement on Tuesday, the president also said he instructed the FRSC "to improve highway monitoring and reduce the number of road accidents nationwide".</p>

<p>Road accidents are common on Nigeria's poorly maintained roads due largely to speeding and disregard for traffic rules.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<ol>
	<li>Hezbollah has been using a private, fixed-line telecommunications network dating back to the early 2000s, news agency Reuters reported on July 9.&nbsp;The use of pagers appears to be an extension of this method of keeping communications to the most basic to avoid being intercepted and tracked.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>"Each one who received a new pager, throw it away," said a voice message that was circulated to Hezbollah members, according to one of the members, who shared it with <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/09/17/lebanon-pagers-exploding-hezbollah/" rel="no follow, no index">The Washington Post</a>.</li>
	<li>It is not yet fully known how exactly the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/thousands-of-pagers-explode-in-lebanon-several-members-injured-in-biggest-security-breach-says-hezbollah-6587184">pagers were made to explode</a>. Some experts on social media said they suspect Israeli intelligence operatives may have intercepted a large order of pagers by the Hezbollah, and either rigged them with small plastic explosives or replaced the pagers with similar looking models but which are actually mini bombs.</li>
	<li>Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah had previously warned the group's members not to carry cellphones, saying that they could be used by Israel to track their movements and to carry out targeted strikes.</li>
	<li>Israel's electronic eavesdropping - including hacking into cell phones and computers - is also widely regarded as among the world's most sophisticated.</li>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hot on the heels of still-dominant diesel cars, electric vehicles now outnumber petrol models for the first time in oil-rich Norway, a world first that puts the country on track to taking fossil fuel vehicles off the road.</p>

<p>Of the 2.8 million private cars registered in Norway, 754,303 are all-electric, compared to 753,905 that run on petrol, the Norwegian Road Federation (OFV), an industry organisation, said in a statement on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Diesel models remain most numerous at just under one million, but their sales are falling sharply.</p>

<p>"This is historic. A milestone few saw coming 10 years ago," OFV director Oyvind Solberg Thorsen said in a statement.</p>

<p>"The electrification of the fleet of passenger cars is going quickly, and Norway is thereby rapidly moving towards becoming the first country in the world with a passenger car fleet dominated by electric cars," Thorsen said.</p>

<p>The speed at which Norway's car fleet is being renewed "suggests that in 2026 we will have more electric cars than diesel cars," he said.</p>

<p>"As far as I know, no other country in the world is in the same situation" with EVs outnumbering petrol cars, he told AFP.</p>

<p>According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), electric vehicles made up just 3.2 percent of the global car fleet in 2023 -- 4.1 percent in France, 7.6 percent in China, 18 percent in Iceland -- with this data including rechargeable hybrid cars, unlike the Norwegian data.</p>

<p>Norway, paradoxically a major oil and gas producer, has set a target to sell only zero-emission vehicles by 2025, 10 years ahead of the European Union's goal. Norway is not an EU member.</p>

<p>Boosted by sales of the Tesla Model Y, all-electric vehicles made up a record 94.3 percent of new car registrations in August in Norway, a sharp contrast to EV struggles seen elsewhere in Europe.</p>

<p>"We're almost there," said Christina Bu, head of the Norwegian Electric Vehicle Association.</p>

<p>"Now the government just has to make a little extra effort in the 2025 budget bill (to be presented to parliament on October 7) and resist the temptation to raise taxes on EVs while continuing to increase those on fuel cars," she told AFP.</p>

<p>In a bid to electrify road transport to help meet Norway's climate commitments, authorities have offered generous tax rebates on EVs, making them competitively priced compared to highly-taxed fuel and diesel cars, as well as hybrid vehicles.</p>

<p>Several other EV incentives -- including exemptions on inner city tolls, free parking and use of collective transport lanes -- have also played a role in Norway's success, even though those have gradually been rolled back over the years.</p>

<p><strong>Sharp contrast with Europe</strong></p>

<p>Norway has come a long way in 20 years: in September 2004, the country's car fleet counted 1.6 million petrol cars, around 230,000 diesel cars and just 1,000 EVs, OFV noted.</p>

<p>The transition to EVs has played a big role in Norway's efforts to meet its climate commitments, which include a 55-percent reduction in greenhouse gases by 2030 from 1990 levels.</p>

<p>But it is not enough.</p>

<p>In 2023, emissions shrank by 4.7 percent from the previous year, according to official statistics, but the decline compared to 1990 was just 9.1 percent.</p>

<p>Electric cars are considered even more climate-friendly in Norway, where almost all electricity is generated by hydro power.</p>

<p>This success story contrasts sharply with the situation in the rest of Europe, where sales of EVs are slumping as hybrid models prove more popular.</p>

<p>Electric car sales began falling at the end of 2023, and account for just 12.5 percent of new cars sold on the continent since the start of the year, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA).</p>

<p>Their share of the market is expected to increase sharply in 2025, to between 20 and 24 percent of new car registrations, according to think tank Transport &amp; Environment (T&amp;E).</p>

<p>Some doubt the EU's ability to completely ban fuel and diesel cars by 2035.</p>

<p>In Norway's neighbour and EU member Sweden, sales of new EVs have decreased this year for the first time, according to industry group Mobility Sweden, likely the result of a government decision to remove a rebate on EV purchases.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A recent two-page memo outlines strict appearance requirements for interviews, training, and career advancement.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Delta Air Lines has issued a stern reminder to potential flight attendants: wear underwear. A recent <a class="sp_lnk2" href="http://chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://view.pagetiger.com/FAInvitations/fa-hiring-process-and-faqs/DeltaAirLinesFlightAttendantHiringCandidateAppearanceRequirements-2024.pdf">two-page memo</a>&nbsp;has outlined strict appearance requirements for interviews, training, and career advancement for present and potential flight attendants. The guidelines cover grooming, hair, jewellery, and clothing, with a notable emphasis on undergarments. According to the memo, "proper undergarments" are mandatory, but they must remain invisible. The airline also stressed professionalism and neat appearance and ordered current and aspiring flight attendants to adhere to these standards.&nbsp;</p>

<p>''Delta Flight Attendants spend the most time with our customers and are the face of our airline. They must be passionate about enhancing each customer's experience while embodying the Delta brand. A Delta Flight Attendant is expected to deliver a Welcoming, Elevated and Caring experience while creating moments that matter to our customers. The customer service experience begins the moment a Flight Attendant puts on their uniform. &nbsp;The Delta uniform represents always putting safety first, pride in the Delta culture and demonstrates a genuine graciousness that will be remembered by our customers,'' the memo read.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>To maintain a professional image, Delta outlined specific guidelines:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Hair must be naturally coloured, without bold highlights or artificial shades.</li>
	<li>For longer hair, it must be pulled back and secured above the shoulders. If it extends past the mid-back, it needs to be pinned up.</li>
	<li>Eyelashes should look natural</li>
	<li>When it comes to nails, they must be simple and subtle - no neon colours, multi-colour, glitter, or hand-painted designs are allowed</li>
	<li>Tattoos must be covered, but bandages aren't an acceptable solution</li>
	<li>Only a single nose piercing is permitted, and the allowed studs include gold, silver, white pearl, or clear diamond/diamond-like&nbsp;</li>
	<li>In terms of other piercings, only two earrings per ear are allowed, and they must be smaller than a dime and not hoops</li>
	<li>Body piercings, other than the nose, are not allowed to be visible.</li>
</ul>

<p>When it comes to clothing, Delta emphasised professionalism and fit. The memo mandated that dresses and skirts should fall at or below knee length, and athletic shoes will not permitted. Instead, flight attendants need to opt for closed-toe flats, heels, or sling-back shoes. For those wearing the male uniform, a tie is required with button-collared dress shirts.</p>

<p>During the interview day, Delta said that the airline maintains a strict no-tolerance policy for profanity, chewing gum, and phone or earbud use.</p>

<p>''We will work with you to accommodate a specific manner of dress or physical appearance in<br />
keeping with religious beliefs or practices unless it causes a safety hazard or other undue burden<br />
on the company,” the memo concluded.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Meta Platforms is rolling out enhanced privacy and parental controls for&nbsp;Instagram&nbsp;accounts of users under 18 in a significant overhaul aimed at addressing growing concerns around the negative effects of social media.</p>

<p>Meta will port all designated&nbsp;Instagram&nbsp;accounts automatically to "Teen Accounts", which will be private accounts by default, the company said on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Users of such accounts can only be messaged and tagged by accounts they follow or are already connected to, while sensitive content settings will be dialed to the most restrictive available.</p>

<p>Users under 16 can change the default settings only with a parent's permission. Parents will also get a suite of settings to monitor who their children are engaging with and limit their use of the app.</p>

<p>Several studies have linked social media use to higher levels of depression, anxiety and learning disabilities, particularly in young users.</p>

<p>Meta, ByteDance's TikTok and Google's GOOGL.O YouTube already face hundreds of lawsuits filed on behalf of children and school districts about the addictive nature of social media. Last year, 33 U.S. states including California and New York sued the company for misleading the public about the dangers of its platforms.</p>

<p>Top platforms, including Facebook,&nbsp;Instagram&nbsp;and TikTok, allow users who are 13 years of age and above to sign up.</p>

<p>Meta's move comes three years after it abandoned development on a version of the&nbsp;Instagram&nbsp;app meant for teenagers, after lawmakers and advocacy groups urged the company to drop it, citing safety concerns.</p>

<p>In July, the U.S. Senate advanced two online safety bills - The Kids Online Safety Act and The Children and Teens' Online Privacy Protection Act - that would force social media companies to take responsibility for how their platforms affect children and teens.</p>

<p>As part of the update, the under-18&nbsp;Instagram&nbsp;users will be notified to close the app after 60 minutes each day. The accounts will also come with a default sleep mode that will silence notifications overnight.</p>

<p>Meta said it will place the identified users into teen accounts within 60 days in the US, UK, Canada and Australia, and in the European Union later this year. Teens around the world will start to get teen accounts in January.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Arab nations have, for the first time ever, agreed to recognise Israel as a country, but Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is being "frustrating" as he has not accepted a ceasefire deal that would ensure the return of peace in Gaza, Indian-American Congressman Ami Bera has said.</p>

<p>"Benjamin Netanyahu is standing in the way of the ceasefire deal," Congressman Bera said in an exclusive interview to NDTV.</p>

<p>Speaking about the lengthy process of securing a ceasefire deal, Congressman Bera said, "I am frustrated as well. You need both Hamas and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to come to the table. And I am frustrated with PM Netanyahu. He should accept the ceasefire deal and we should get the hostages released."</p>

<p>He highlighted the fact that Saudi Arabia and other Arab nations are willing to change relations with Israel and recognise it as a country, calling it a "remarkable" development. However, he said that it will all only begin with a ceasefire deal and starting a discussion about the two-state solution. "Prime Minister Netanyahu is the one standing in the way of that," Mr Bera said.</p>

<p>Ami Bera, who is in his sixth consecutive term, is the senior-most and the longest serving Indian-American Congressman in the House of Representatives.</p>

<p>He is a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and House Select Committee on Intelligence.</p>

<p>The Congressman also outlined Vice President Kamala Harris' stance on the Gaza crisis and what steps she could take if elected president in the November elections. "Vice President Harris has talked about the tragedy on October 7 but also the tragic loss of civilian lives after October 7. She, along with President Biden, understands the importance of getting a ceasefire and getting the hostages home."</p>

<p>She has iterated the importance of both Jewish people living safely in Israel and Palestinian people living with dignity and peace, Mr Bera said.</p>

<p>The nearly year-long war in Gaza has seen the loss of more than 40,000 lives. Meanwhile, months of negotiations mediated by Egypt, Qatar, and the United States have failed to stop the conflict between Hamas and Israel.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nine people have died and more than 2,800 injured, many grievously so, in Lebanon in a synchronised detonation of pagers targeting US-designated terror group Hezbollah. Iran's state media reported that its Ambassador to Lebanon,&nbsp;Mojtaba Amani, has also been wounded in the incident. The explosions happened at around 3:30 pm local time in Lebanon (6 pm IST).</p>

<p>Lebanese Health Minister Firass Abiad confirmed that nine people were killed and around 2,800 wounded in the incident.</p>

<p>The minister, in a televised press conference, said the blasts "killed nine people, including a girl", adding that "About 2,800 people were injured and more than 200 of them critically". The injuries were mostly on the face, hands and stomach, he further said.</p>

<p>The 10-year-old daughter of a Hezbollah member was killed in east Lebanon's Bekaa Valley. An independent war monitor has said that fourteen people have also been injured in pager blasts in Syria.</p>

<p>Hezbollah, which is banned both by the United States and the European Union is the political and military establishment in Lebanon and is backed by Iran. Hezbollah backs Hamas, which has been at war with Israel in Gaza since October 2023.</p>

<p>The sons of Hezbollah lawmakers Ali Ammar and Hassan Fadlallah were among the dead, a source close to the group told news agency AFP.</p>

<p>While some reports claim that the explosions were caused due to the overheating of lithium batteries caused by an electronic signal breach (quite like a cyber attack), some other reports allege that a thin lining of explosives were placed inside the pagers before being supplied. <strong>NDTV cannot independently verify either of these claims at the moment</strong>.</p>

<p>Hezbollah has blamed Israel for the attack and has claimed that this is the "biggest security breach" it has faced yet. All the pagers exploded nearly the same time, the Hezbollah has claimed, saying that this is an "Israeli breach" of its communications network.</p>

<p class="ins_instory_dv_caption">Iran's Ambassador to Lebanon Mojtaba Amani has been injured in the incident</p>
</div>

<p>Hezbollah strongholds across Lebanon have been hit by the "Israeli breach". This is the first such major incident since the group began trading fire with Israel almost every day in its support for Hamas which is at war with Israel in Gaza since the October 7 "terror attack" targeting Israeli nationals.</p>

<p>The explosions happened outside Lebanon too, as four people were injured in Syria as at least one pager blew up in a vehicle in Damascus.</p>

<p>"Dozens of Hezbollah members have been wounded in the south and in Beirut's southern suburbs after their pagers exploded," a source close to Hezbollah told news agency AFP, requesting anonymity to discuss sensitive matters.</p>

<p>Lebanon's official National News Agency called it "an unprecedented enemy security incident" with "handheld pagers detonating" at nearly the same time across Lebanon.</p>

<p>According to AFP, Hezbollah communicates through its own telecommunications system and has asked its members to avoid using mobile phones since the Gaza war began almost a year ago. The diktat was issued to avoid Israeli breaches of the technology.</p>

<h2><strong>HEZBOLLAH BLAMES ISRAEL IN STATEMENT</strong></h2>

<p>Hezbollah put out a statement shortly after the pager explosions saying that at "Around 3:30 pm (local time) on Tuesday, several pager devices used by Hezbollah members and officials of various institutions exploded."</p>

<p>"Israel is fully responsible for the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/pager-bombs-target-hezbollah-in-lebanon-what-we-know-so-far-5-points-6588316" target="_blank">pager blasts</a>," Hezbollah said.</p>

<p>The statement further read, "A girl and her two brothers" were killed in the incident, while many others were injured.</p>

<p>"The relevant authorities in Hezbollah are currently conducting extensive security and scientific investigations to find the reasons for these simultaneous explosions," it added.</p>

<p>The statement urged people to be "cautious of rumors and misinformation spread by certain parties, as this may serve the psychological warfare" by Israel.</p>

<p>Israel has not yet responded to these claims made by Hezbollah or Iran.</p>

<h3><strong>WHAT IS A PAGER? HOW DOES IT WORK?</strong></h3>

<p>A pager is an electronic telecommunications device which were mostly used in the 1990s and early 2000s to send text and alpha-numeric messages. Pagers usually beep, vibrate, or flash short text notifications to alert or update the end user.</p>

<p>Pagers, also known as beepers or bleepers, is a wireless communications device that receives and displays alphanumeric and in some cases, voice messages.</p>

<p>There are various types of pagers - A one-way pager can only receive messages, while a two-way or 'response' pagers can also respond. The response also is an alpha-numeric text which acknowledges or replies to the original message using an internal transmitter.</p>

<p>Two-way pagers, also known as response pagers typically work using ReFLEX protocol, which was developed in the mid-1990s by Motorola Corp. FLEX provides one-way communication only (from the provider to the pager device), but a related protocol called ReFLEX provides two-way messaging.</p>

<p>Modern paging systems typically use multiple base transmitters to modulate the same signal on the same RF or Radio Frequency channel, a design approach called simulcast.</p>

<p>Data transmitted over FLEX and ReFLEX is not encrypted and is hence vulnerable to breaches. There are codes used to improve the integrity of the data, but these are not cryptographically secure.</p>

<p>What encryption methods were being used by the Hezbollah is not known.<br />

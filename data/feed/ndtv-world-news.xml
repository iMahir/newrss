       <description><![CDATA[Sheikh Hasina, who resigned as Bangladesh's prime minister and fled the country on Monday following weeks of protests, did not want to leave at all but did so on the family's insistence, his US-based son told NDTV.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/who-is-sheikh-hasina-who-once-saved-bangladesh-from-military-rule-6267638">Sheikh Hasina</a>, who resigned as Bangladesh's prime minister and fled the country on Monday following <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/how-bangladesh-student-protests-led-to-sheikh-hasinas-resignation-6268678">weeks of protests</a>, did not want to leave at all but did so on the family's insistence, his US-based son and former Chief Advisor Sajeeb Wajed Joy told NDTV.</p>

<p>"She wanted to stay, she did not want to leave the country at all. But we kept insisting that it wasn't safe for her. We were concerned for her physical safety first; so we persuaded her to leave," her son Joy told NDTV's Marya Shakil in a telephonic interview.</p>

<p>"I spoke to her this morning. The situation in Bangladesh, as you can see, is anarchy. She is in good spirits but she is very disappointed. It's very disheartening for her because it was her dream to turn Bangladesh into a developed country and she worked so hard for it over the last 15 years, keeping it safe from militants and as well as from terrorism and in spite of all of that this vocal minority, the opposition, the militants have now seized power," he said.</p>

<p>Her flight came less than seven months after she celebrated a fourth straight term in power - and fifth overall - by sweeping national elections in January.</p>

<p>The 76-year-old was flown in a military helicopter on Monday with her sister to take refuge in India. She is expected to leave for London later, sources told NDTV, where she may seek political asylum.</p>

<p>Her son, however, said he did not discuss with her where she is headed now.</p>

<p>Her last 15 years in power were marked by arrests of opposition leaders, crackdowns on free speech and suppression of dissent, and she resigned in the face of deadly student-led protests that have killed hundreds.</p>

<p>Protests began in June after student groups' demands for the scrapping of a controversial quota system in government jobs escalated into a movement seeking the end of her rule.</p>

<p>"We hope that there will be elections in Bangladesh but at this time with our party leaders being targeted I don't see how free and fair elections would be possible. In a way, it is no longer the family's responsibility. We have shown what we can do. We have shown How much we can develop Bangladesh and if the people of Bangladesh aren't willing to stand up and they are willing to let this violent minority seize power then people get the leadership they deserve," said his son.</p>

<p>Pressed to answer if his mother did the best for the country, he said, "Absolutely. Awami League still remains the most popular party in the country. BNP has the chance to come back to power and we have seen what they were like the last time. They ran the country to the ground. The militants had a free hand; they attacked the minorities with impunity."</p>

<p>Bangladeshi President Mohammed Shahabuddin ordered the release of jailed former prime minister and <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/bangladesh-president-orders-release-of-jailed-ex-pm-khaleda-zia-6270786">key opposition leader Khaleda Zia</a>, hours after her arch-rival Sheikh Hasina was ousted and the military took power.</p>

<p>Bangladesh's army chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman said in a broadcast to the nation on state television that Hasina had resigned and the military would form a caretaker government.</p>

<p>"The country has suffered a lot, the economy has been hit, many people have been killed -- it is time to stop the violence," said Waker, shortly after jubilant crowds stormed and looted Hasina's official residence.</p>

<p>Bangladesh's Channel 24 broadcast images of crowds running into the prime minister's compound, grinning and waving to the camera, looting furniture and books, or relaxing on beds.</p>

<p>The military said it would lift a curfew imposed to quash protests at dawn Tuesday.</p>

<p>"I doubt army will be able to normalise things that fast. Because right now what is happening is that the opposition and the militants, they are not only vandalising, they are also hunting out our leaders, former ministers and even what I am hearing minorties. I don't think the violence has ended," said Mr Joy. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Mobs raided and ransacked the homes of Hasina's Awami League party allies as well as police stations, witnesses told news agency AFP.</p>

<p>Crowds smashed statues of her father Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the country's independence hero, and set fire to a museum dedicated to him.</p>

<p>"The emotion is one of disappointment, anger, that my grandfather liberated the country and they killed him and my entire family. And now the same powers, these are the minorities that opposed the independence of Bangladesh are using this opportunity to basically deny and destroy our hard-fought struggle for freedom. And it's very disheartening to see that the majority of Bangladesh is staying silent," said Mr Joy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The south Asian nation has a long history of coups.</p>

<p>The military declared an emergency in January 2007 after widespread political unrest and installed a military-backed caretaker government for two years.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Virginia man was charged with making violent online threats against Vice President Kamala Harris days after she began her US presidential campaign.</p>

<p>Frank Carillo was charged on Friday in federal court in Virginian with threatening the vice president after posting a series of messages targeting Kamala Harris on the social media site GETTR, according to court records.</p>

<p>Kamala Harris is the Democratic candidate facing Republican former President Donald Trump in the November 5 presidential election.</p>

<p>"Kamala Harris needs to be put on fire alive I will do it personally if no one else does," read one post cited in court documents. Another said Kamala Harris is "going to regret ever trying to become president."</p>

<p>The messages were posted on July 27, six days after President Joe Biden announced he would not run for reelection and endorsed Kamala Harris to take his place as the Democratic candidate.</p>

<p>The account also posted messages targeting Biden and FBI Director Christopher Wray.</p>

<p>FBI agents seized a rifle and a handgun during a search of Frank Carillo's home, according to court documents.</p>

<p>Frank Carillo was expected to make his first court appearance on Monday. Attorney information for Frank Carillo was not immediately available.</p>

<p>US Justice Department officials have been concerned by what they have called a spike in threats to public officials in the United States.</p>

<p>Trump was wounded in an assassination attempt at a campaign rally last month. Officials have not identified a motive for the shooting.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris has narrowed her search for a vice presidential running mate to two finalists, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, three sources with knowledge of the matter said.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris has narrowed her search for a vice presidential running mate to two finalists, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, three sources with knowledge of the matter said on Monday.</p>

<p>Kamala Harris, the US vice president, is expected to announce her selection by Tuesday, ahead of her first scheduled public appearance with her running mate that evening at Temple University in Philadelphia.</p>

<p>It was unclear if a final decision has been made, the sources said. The rally will kick off a five-day, seven-city tour of battleground states likely to decide the Nov. 5 election.</p>

<p>The choice of a running mate is one of the most consequential decisions of Kamala Harris' political career, as she hastily pulls together a campaign to challenge Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and US Senator JD Vance, his vice presidential pick, in the Nov. 5 election. Vance will also make a campaign stop in South Philadelphia on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Josh Shapiro, 51, is a rising star of the party with strong approval ratings in Pennsylvania, whose 19 electoral votes makes it a must-win state for both Kamala Harris and Trump.</p>

<p>A former state attorney general, Josh Shapiro would add to the ticket's historical significance; he would be the country's first Jewish vice president, while Kamala Harris is seeking to become the first Black and South Asian American woman elected US president.</p>

<p>Josh Shapiro's strong support for Israel could alienate some progressive voters, though it could also appeal to moderate voters and defang Republican efforts to turn the Israel-Gaza war into a wedge issue for Democrats.</p>

<p>Tim Walz, 60, is a former US Army National Guard member and a former teacher who has raised his profile in recent weeks as an effective advocate for Kamala Harris. He has attacked Trump and Vance as "weird," a viral insult the Kamala Harris campaign has embraced.</p>

<p>A former member of Congress from a Republican-leaning district, Tim Walz has proven appeal to rural, white voters, though he has also championed progressive policies as governor, such as free school meals and expanded paid worker leave. While Minnesota is a solidly Democratic state, it is close to Wisconsin and Michigan, two crucial battlegrounds.</p>

<p>Speculation had focused on six finalists - four governors, a senator and a cabinet secretary in the Biden administration, all white men with a record of winning over rural, white or independent voters.</p>

<p>In addition to Josh Shapiro and Tim Walz, contenders included US Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear and Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker.</p>

<p>The candidates will be informed on Monday night or Tuesday morning whether they were picked, sources told Reuters. The Kamala Harris campaign plans a social media announcement featuring the duo, campaign officials familiar with the arrangements said.</p>

<p>Kamala Harris' search for a running mate began in earnest two weeks ago, shortly after President Joe Biden withdrew from the race and endorsed her to replace him.</p>

<p>There was no immediate indication that Monday's market selloff would have an impact on Kamala Harris' announcement timing. Trump, seeking to capitalize on the downturn, referred to the "Kamala crash" in a post on his social media site, Truth Social.</p>

<p>Over the weekend, Kamala Harris met with her vetting team, including former attorney general Eric Holder, whose law firm Covington &amp; Burling LLP scrutinized the finances and background of potential running mates. Holder and his office made in-depth presentations on each of the finalists, according to multiple sources familiar with the process.</p>

<p>Kamala Harris is weighing the decision with her husband, Doug Emhoff, brother-in-law Tony West and a small circle of aides and advisers, the sources said.</p>

<p><strong>SEVEN CITIES, FIVE DAYS</strong></p>

<p>On her battleground states tour, Kamala Harris and her running mate will hit seven cities in five days: Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Eau Claire, Wisconsin; Detroit, Michigan; Durham, North Carolina; Savannah, Georgia; Phoenix, Arizona; and Las Vegas, Nevada, said a campaign official, who did not wish to be named.</p>

<p>They will hold rallies in each location along the tour, which will include college campuses, historically Black universities, union halls and restaurants, the official said.</p>

<p>Over the weekend, the Kamala Harris campaign launched a program to persuade Republican voters to support the Democrat and showcased endorsements from Republicans including former Trump White House officials Stephanie Grisham and Olivia Troye.</p>

<p>The program - called Republicans for Kamala Harris - will hold kickoff events in the battleground states of Arizona, North Carolina and Pennsylvania on Monday.</p>

<p>On Monday, Kamala Harris notched another union endorsement with the hospitality workers union praising her as having a longstanding record of delivering for union workers.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Gaza's Civil Defence agency said it received the bodies of 80 unidentified Palestinians from Israel on Monday, which it buried in a mass grave.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gaza's Civil Defence agency said it received the bodies of 80 unidentified Palestinians from Israel on Monday, which it buried in a mass grave.</p>

<p>"We received 80 bodies inside 15 bags, with more than four martyrs in each bag, each wrapped in a single shroud", Civil Defence director Yamen Abu Suleiman told AFP.</p>

<p>Abu Suleiman said Israeli authorities did not provide any information about the bodies, including their names or where they were found or taken from.</p>

<p>"We do not know if they are martyrs (killed in Gaza) or prisoners from (Israel's) jails", he added.</p>

<p>AFP journalists on the scene saw men in hazmat suits inspecting the corpses wrapped in blue plastic sheeting, before unloading them from the shipping container they had arrived in.</p>

<p>The bodies were then laid in a line for burial in a mass grave dug in the sand, with scores of Palestinians watching from the side.</p>

<p>The bodies were later buried at the Turkish cemetery, near Khan Yunis, the main city in the southern part of Gaza, AFP journalists said.</p>

<p><strong>A mother's search</strong></p>

<p>"You will ask me the reason why I put all the bodies in a mass grave?" said Tabesh Abu Ata from the Turkish cemetery.</p>

<p>"Because I have no capabilities to bury each one in an individual grave, (there are no) stones or tiles" for that, he said.</p>

<p>Salwa Karaz, a displaced woman from Gaza City in the north, told AFP that she had gone to the cemetery hoping to find her 32-year-old son Marwan, who went missing in January. He left behind an eight-month-old son.</p>

<p>"When we learned that 80 bodies had been handed over, we came to search in hopes of finding him among them", the 59-year-old told AFP.</p>

<p>"As of now, we have not learned anything," she lamented.</p>

<p>"We will try to identify him through his clothes. He was wearing brown pants, a navy blue shirt, a black jacket, and beige boots."</p>

<p>She last saw him leaving on his bicycle from their shelter in Deir el-Balah, central Gaza.</p>

<p>In a statement released Monday, Hamas said Israel's delivery of bodies without identities "exacerbates the suffering of the families of martyrs and the missing, who seek to know the fate of their abducted children or to bury their martyrs in a dignified manner".</p>

<p>The Israeli military did not offer an immediate comment.</p>

<p>In December, Hamas government sources said Israel returned the bodies of 80 Palestinians killed in Gaza after taking them from morgues and graves to check there were no hostages among them.</p>

<p>The bodies were then buried in Gaza, the sources added.</p>

<p>The war in Gaza began when Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, which resulted in the death of 1,197 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.</p>

<p>Hamas operatives also seized 251 hostages, 111 of whom are still held captive in Gaza, including 39 the military says are dead.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory air and ground campaign in Gaza has killed at least 39,623 people, according to the health ministry in Hamas-ruled Gaza, which does not give details of civilian and militant deaths.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hurricane Debby landed in Florida Monday bringing high winds, pouring rain -- and 25 tightly wrapped packages of cocaine worth more than $1 million.</p>

<p>Debby, which hit the state's northern Big Bend region as a Category One hurricane but has since been downgraded to a tropical storm, washed the trove of drugs ashore along Florida's southernmost tip.</p>

<p>"Hurricane Debby blew 25 packages of cocaine (70 lbs.) onto a beach in the Florida Keys," US Border Patrol acting chief patrol Agent Samuel Briggs II wrote on X.</p>

<p>The load of drugs, which Mr Briggs reported was valued at more than $1 million, was discovered by a good Samaritan who contacted the authorities.</p>

<p>In July of 2023, the mayor of Tampa, Florida similarly discovered 70 pounds (31.7 kilograms) of cocaine that had been washed ashore in the Florida Keys, while enjoying a vacation day.</p>

<p>In addition to bringing cocaine, Debby has killed one person, knocked out power for hundreds of thousands of people, and could produce life-threatening storm surges as well as catastrophic flooding.</p>

<p>The Keys, a string of islands stretching off the state's southern tip, are located in close proximity to a number of Caribbean countries that serve as a transit hub for cocaine being trafficked from South America to Europe and North America, including into Florida.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United Nations said Monday that nine employees of its agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) "may have been involved" in the October 7 attack on southern Israel by Hamas, which sparked war in Gaza, and have been fired.</p>

<p>"We have sufficient information in order to take the actions that we're taking -- which is to say, the termination of these nine individuals," UN spokesman Farhan Haq said.</p>

<p>Farhan&nbsp;Haq said the organization will need to evaluate any further steps to "fully corroborate."</p>

<p>Farhan&nbsp;Haq was speaking after the UN's oversight body completed its investigation into the allegations earlier this year by Israel that a total of 19 UNRWA employees may have been involved in the attack.</p>

<p>That prompted many governments, including top donor the United States, to abruptly suspend funding to the agency, threatening its efforts to deliver aid in Gaza. Several countries have since resumed payments.</p>

<p>Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas in retaliation for the October 7 attack, which resulted in the deaths of 1,197 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures.</p>

<p>Hamas operatives also seized 251 hostages, 111 of whom are still held captive in Gaza, including 39 the military says are dead.</p>

<p>Israel's campaign against Hamas has killed at least 39,550 people in Gaza, according to the territory's health ministry, which does not give breakdowns of civilian and militant deaths.</p>

<p>UNRWA, which has provided essential aid for Palestinian refugees since 1949, has long been criticized by Israel.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, UNRWA's chief Philippe Lazzarini called for Israel to "stop its campaign" against the organization, citing "outrageous" attacks on its employees, facilities and operations.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bangladeshi President Mohammed Shahabuddin on Monday ordered the release of jailed former prime minister and key opposition leader Khaleda Zia, hours after her arch-rival Sheikh Hasina was ousted and the military took power.</p>

<p>The president's press team said in a statement that a meeting led by Shahabuddin had "decided unanimously to free Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) chairperson Begum Khaleda Zia immediately".</p>

<p>Army chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman, along with the head of the navy and airforce, and top leaders of several opposition parties including the BNP and Jamaat-e-Islami party, attended the meeting.</p>

<p>"The meeting has also decided to free all the people who have been arrested during the student protests," the statement added.</p>

<p>Earlier Monday, Waker-Uz-Zaman said in a broadcast to the nation on state television that Sheikh Hasina had resigned and the military would form a caretaker government.</p>

<p>"The meeting decided to form an interim government immediately", it added.</p>

<p>Sheikh Hasina had sought to quell nationwide protests against her government since early July but she fled the country after brutal unrest on Sunday in which nearly 100 people were killed.</p>

<p>Khaleda Zia, 78, is in poor health and confined to hospital after she was sentenced to 17 years in prison for graft in 2018.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

</div>

<p><em>'In my beginning is my end.'&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>There is no situation in the world that cannot be explained through poetry in general, T.S. Eliot's in particular. Sheikh Hasina, one of the longest-serving heads of the government in the world, has demitted office after a month of bloodshed in Bangladesh. Her life seems to be coming full circle-the former Prime Minister has sought refuge in India and is likely to come to Delhi.</p>

<p>The beginning is this. Humiliated by the West Pakistan establishment despite decisively winning the 1970 parliamentary elections, Sheikh Mujibur Rehman - Hasina's father - gave a call for Independence and after a year of bloodshed, Bangladesh came into existence. Mujib was killed; a terrible beauty was born.</p>

<h2><strong>Independence Is A Terrible Thing</strong></h2>

<p>Independence is a thing of beauty. It is also terrible. Rarely does it come into being in the absence of violence. This holds more succinctly for South Asia than any other part of the world, or at least it feels so given the sheer numbers. In India's public imagination, 1971 is all about Mukti Bahini and the Indian armed forces joining hands in birthing Bangladesh. It's about Indira Gandhi and Sam Manekshaw.<br />
After Yahya Khan cancelled the Pakistan National Assembly on March 1, 1971, more than 300 ethnic Biharis were murdered by Mujib's supporters even before the latter's call for mobilisation. Within a month, the Pakistan establishment launched Operation Searchlight to cull Awami League supporters in East Pakistan. This was touted as a legitimate state action to punish conspiracy and unrest.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This quick reckoner is important to understand how even the noblest political causes have their genesis in questionable actions and their motives. They often have a legacy of blood. Hasina and some of her family members were rescued in 1975 by Indian forces after Mujib's erstwhile compatriots and comrades turned against him. Mujib was murdered in his residence on August 15, 1975, along with six members of his immediate family, including his wife, brother and sons. It was the same old story of Brutus stabbing Caesar; 32 Dhanmondi was the new Largo di Torre Argentina.</p>

<p>Once hailed as a messiah, Mujib had been facing criticism on several counts: corruption, nepotism, mismanagement of the 1974 famine, favouritism, etc. He was accused of turning into what he once opposed - a dictator. This has been Hasina's history and legacy. Fleeing Bangladesh for safety once again, Sheikh Hasina may be reminiscent of it.</p>

<h2><strong>It Was Never Going To Be Easy</strong></h2>

<p>Ever since its inception, Bangladesh has witnessed election-time violence between the ruling Awami League and the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party. Concerns around Bangladesh's ability to conduct free and fair elections have loomed large over electoral processes. The number of clashes between the supporters of the two parties in the run-up to the 2024 elections more than tripled from the 2018 elections. Hasina's fourth consecutive term was not going to be easy by any means. As predicted, the results were disputed by the BNP and other opposition parties. She handled the charges like any astute politician. The student-led protests over quotas in government jobs turned out to be her Achilles's heel. South Asia, as a whole, is quite forgiving of politicians and regimes. But only to a certain extent. As long as the governments are seen to be at war only with their political and ideological opponents, the voters may not care. When the attack reaches their doorsteps, people rise. They may not succeed in overthrowing a regime always, they make their intent felt.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The civil unrest in Bangladesh, therefore, is an accretion of a historical political feud between the two largest parties, the military's constant hankering for power, anti-incumbency, and a genuine concern for the deteriorating participatory democracy in the country. Adding to this mix is the curious case of secularist authoritarianism. The so-called 'Bangladesh model' is hailed by the establishment in India, a secular republic, and decried by Pakistan. But there have been some genuine concerns about how Awami League has been using secularism as a calling card to cull all forms of dissent. Post-Islamism, as proposed by Hasina's party, remains a Holy Grail project for Bangladesh: ever elusive, always used for mass mobilisation, never attained.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>A Deja Vu Moment</strong></h2>

<p>The Sheikh family has now seen and experienced it all - from all the possible vantage points. They have been both the oppressed and the oppressor. The hunter and the hunted.</p>

<p>It's a deja vu moment for Bangladesh. And it's both a deja vu moment and a moment of reckoning for India. Brutal and bloody regime changes are inevitable when reason and rapprochement fail. The new order may not always be in line with the expectations; it may even be worse. But the desire to overthrow the dysfunctional, perceived or real, order is an all-consuming passion.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To end it with Eliot's verse:&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>'In succession<br />
Houses rise and fall, crumble, are extended,<br />
Are removed, destroyed, restored, or in their place<br />
Is an open field, or a factory, or a by-pass.<br />
Old stone to new building, old timber to new fires,<br />
Old fires to ashes, and ashes to the earth<br />
Which is already flesh, fur and faeces,<br />
Bone of man and beast, cornstalk and leaf.'</em></p>

       <description><![CDATA[Gaza's health ministry reported that nearly 40,000 people have been killed in Gaza since war between Israel and Hamas broke out on October 7.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Once a day, Umm Omar picks up the phone and calls her late husband, humouring their four-year-old daughter who does not understand yet her father was killed early in the Gaza war.</p>

<p>Little Ella "wants us to call him, to tell him about her day", said Umm Omar, who has fled with her three children to Al-Mawasi, a coastal area teeming with mostly displaced Palestinians in the southern Gaza Strip.</p>

<p>A steadily climbing death count, reported by the Hamas-run territory's health ministry, nears 40,000 people killed in Gaza since war between Israel and Palestinian militants broke out on October 7.</p>

<p>It was triggered by Hamas's attack on southern Israel that day which resulted in the deaths of 1,197 people, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.</p>

<p>Umm Omar told AFP she did not understand "how the months have gone by" since her husband, Ibrahim al-Shanbari, was killed in an Israeli strike on northern Gaza.</p>

<p>When he died, Umm Omar said she lost everything "in a fraction of a second", but there was little time to bury him properly, grieve or process the loss of the "kind" man that he was.</p>

<p>There was no funeral procession or "any of the usual mourning (rituals) because it's wartime", Umm Omar added.</p>

<p>"It was very difficult to say goodbye... because the martyrs were buried very quickly," she said, with fighting raging across the besieged territory.</p>

<p>To help Ella, "I ended up pretending" her father was still alive, said Umm Omar.</p>

<p>Still, according to her, others had it worse, "those who have lost an entire family, those who have not been able to say goodbye, or those who find their children in pieces".</p>

<p>With more than 1.5 per cent of Gaza's 2.4 million people killed during the war, many inhabitants of the besieged coastal territory have lost loved ones.</p>

<p>The smell of death is everywhere, but under constant bombardment, shelling and battles, Gazans often have little time -- or place that is not in ruins -- to process their grief.</p>

<p><strong>- 'Death has replaced life' -</strong></p>

<p>Some bled to death before reaching hospitals, many of which had gone out of service due to the fighting or facing severe shortages amid an Israeli siege imposed early on in the war.</p>

<p>Other victims were crushed under their toppled homes, their bodies eventually retrieved from the rubble of bombed-out neighbourhoods. Some are still missing, feared buried under the ruins.</p>

<p>To Mustafa al-Khatib, 56, who has lost several relatives, "death has replaced life."</p>

<p>The incessant violence has rendered many cemeteries inaccessible, often forcing Gazans to dig makeshift graves with whatever tools they can find, Khatib told AFP.</p>

<p>And "there are no stones or cement to make a concrete covering for the grave either", he said.</p>

<p>The hasty interment of Khatib's uncle in a hospital yard has left him with a "heavy heart", he said.</p>

<p>His sister was laid to rest at a long abandoned cemetery, which Khatib said was later bombed.</p>

<p>In central Gaza's Al-Maghazi refugee camp, a woman placed her hand on the ground outside a school used a displacement shelter: this is where she said her daughter was buried after dying in her arms, fatally wounded in a blast.</p>

<p>With nearly all Gazans displaced at least once by the war, and often far from home, they have resorted to burying loved ones on any available patch of land, in the street, or sometimes on football fields.</p>

<p>Many do not know when they may be able to return to their burial spots or even find them again.</p>

<p><strong>- Longing for a final embrace -</strong></p>

<p>In the nearly 10 months since the war began, AFP correspondents have witnessed mass burials and bodies put in the ground in blood-stained blankets.</p>

<p>Some were wrapped in plastic sheets, marked with a number rather than a name, either because the bodies were unrecognisable or because no relatives had come to claim them.</p>

<p>Across the ravaged territory, which had already suffered for years under a crippling Israeli-led blockade and past cycles of violence, hasty burials are now conducted daily in the midst of fighting, evacuation orders and hazardous journeys to find food, water and medical care.</p>

<p>Khatib said he had "grown accustomed" to the often chaotic and fleeting farewells before friends and family return to their daily task of survival.</p>

<p>Some never had the chance to say goodbye.</p>

<p>Gazans interviewed by AFP have struggled or were outright unable to express their grief and loss. Many said they await their own death to rejoin their loved ones.</p>

<p>For more than six months, Ali Khalil has known that his 32-year-old son Mohammed was killed in the bombing of his home in the Al-Shati refugee camp, on the outskirts of Gaza City.</p>

<p>But he was far, having fled for safety with his grandchildren to the coastal territory's south, when he heard the news.</p>

<p>"What hurts me the most is not having been able to bury my son, not having hugged him and not having said goodbye to him," said the grieving 54-year-old man.</p>

<p>"I wonder if his body remained intact or if it was in pieces. I have no idea."</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Diplomatic pressure mounted Monday to avoid an escalation between Iran and Israel following high-profile killings that have sent regional tensions soaring, while numerous governments urged their citizens to leave Lebanon.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Diplomatic pressure mounted Monday to avoid an escalation between Iran and Israel following high-profile killings that have sent regional tensions soaring, while numerous governments urged their citizens to leave Lebanon.</p>

<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said late Sunday that his country was "determined to stand against" Iran and its allied armed groups "on all fronts".</p>

<p>As its war against Iran-backed Hamas in Gaza nears its 11th month, Israel has been bracing for retaliation from the Tehran-aligned "axis of resistance" for the assassinations of two senior figures.</p>

<p>Palestinian armed group Hamas's political leader Ismail Haniyeh was killed in Tehran on Wednesday in an attack blamed on Israel, which has not directly commented on it.</p>

<p>The killing came hours after an Israeli strike on Beirut left Hezbollah military chief Fuad Shukr dead.</p>

<p>Tehran said Monday that "no one has the right to doubt Iran's legal right to punish the Zionist regime" for Haniyeh's killing.</p>

<p>US Secretary of State Antony Blinken told his counterparts from the G7 nations in a conference call on Sunday that any attack, which he expected to be a joint undertaking between Hezbollah and Iran, could happen within 24 to 48 hours, as early as Monday, US news site Axios reported.</p>

<p>Blinken asked his counterparts to place diplomatic pressure on Tehran, Hezbollah and Israel to "maintain maximum restraint", it added.</p>

<h3>Israel's military spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said on Sunday night that "as of now there is no change" in its policy for protecting civilians.</h3>

<p>In the northern port city of Haifa, shop owner Yehuda Levi, 45, told AFP that Israelis are used to conflict, but facing a multi-pronged attack "is a little tricky".</p>

<p>"It's difficult, but we believe we're a strong country. We're going to win this war."</p>

<h3><strong>'Path of dialogue'</strong></h3>

<p>Experts and diplomats fear that the expected attack on Israel could rapidly spiral into a regional war.</p>

<p>Turkey on Monday joined multiple Western and other nations calling on their citizens to leave Lebanon, where Hezbollah is based.</p>

<p>Numerous airlines have suspended flights to the country or limited them to daylight hours.</p>

<p>Germany's Lufthansa, which has already suspended flights to the region including Tel Aviv, said its planes would avoid Iraqi and Iranian airspace until at least August 7.</p>

<p>The United Nations' rights chief Volker Turk called on "all parties, along with those states with influence, to act urgently to de-escalate what has become a very precarious situation".</p>

<p>Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani, whose country currently holds the rotating G7 presidency, said in a statement: "We call on the parties involved to desist from any initiative that could hinder the path of dialogue and moderation."</p>

<p>On Sunday, Jordan's Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi made a rare trip to the Iranian capital during which he delivered a message from King Abdullah II to President Masoud Pezeshkian.</p>

<p>Jordanian "airspace will probably be a theatre for missiles and anti-missile" fire in any direct Iranian-Israeli clashes, but Amman would strongly object to violations of its sovereignty, said political analyst Oraib Rantawi.</p>

<p>"The Iranians must find other ways to spare Jordan this embarrassment," Rantawi, director of the Amman-based Al Quds Center for Political Studies, told AFP.</p>

<p>The Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip, triggered by the Palestinian group's October 7 attack, has already drawn in Iran-backed rebels in Syria, Lebanon, Iraq and Yemen.</p>

<p>The Hamas attack on southern Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,197 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures.</p>

<p>Hamas also seized 251 hostages, 111 of whom are still held captive in Gaza, including 39 the military says are dead.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory campaign has killed at least 39,623 people in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry, which does not give details of civilian and operative deaths.</p>

<h3><strong>Cross-border clashes</strong></h3>

<p>Even as the region braced for further escalation, Hezbollah and Israel continued their near-daily exchanges of fire.</p>

<p>The Lebanese health ministry said four people were killed in two separate strikes on the border towns of Mais al-Jabal and Hula, while Hezbollah said it had targeted military sites in northern Israel with "explosive-laden drones".</p>

<p>Tehran has said it expects Hezbollah to hit deeper inside Israel and no longer be confined to military targets.</p>

<p>Israel's ally the United States said it was moving additional warships and fighter jets to the region.</p>

<p>US President Joe Biden was scheduled to meet with his national security team later Monday "to discuss developments in the Middle East", the White House said.</p>

<p>The cross-border violence since October has killed at least 549 people in Lebanon, mostly fighters but also including at least 116 civilians, according to an AFP tally.</p>

<p>On the Israeli side, including the annexed Golan Heights, 22 soldiers and 25 civilians have been killed, according to army figures.</p>

<p>Far from the Lebanese border, the Israeli military said around 15 rockets had crossed from the southern Gaza Strip into Israel on Monday, with medics saying they were treating an injured man.</p>

<p>Months of talks, mediated by Qatar, Egypt and the United States, aimed at a Gaza ceasefire and a hostage-release deal have repeatedly stalled.</p>

<p>Hamas officials but also some analysts as well as protesters in Israel have accused Netanyahu of prolonging the war to safeguard his hard-right ruling coalition.</p>

<p>The killing of Haniyeh, who was Hamas's lead negotiator in truce talks, "does not suggest Israel is sincerely interested in a ceasefire", said Middle East expert Andreas Krieg.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Actor-comedian Julia Louis-Dreyfus has teased that she will attend this month's Democratic National Convention in support of Vice President Kamala Harris, saying she will be "extra-involved" in the campaign.</p>

<p>Kamala Harris, a Democrat, would face her Republican rival and former president Donald Trump in the US general elections on November 5.</p>

<p>Louis-Dreyfus, whose popular character Vice President Selina Meyer on the acclaimed show "Veep" has been compared to Kamala Harris by many, was asked about being part of the Democratic National Convention in Chicago to root for the latter.</p>

<p>"I probably will be, yes," she told The Times of London, adding that she plans to be "extra-involved" in Kamala Harris' campaign.</p>

<p>The actor, who has won six Emmys for "Veep" in the show's five-year run on HBO, said comparisons between her character and Kamala Harris were "inevitable".</p>

<p>"If Selina had any advice for Kamala, she had best not take it. I think Kamala is so intelligent she wouldn't take the call," she added.</p>

<p>Created by Armando Iannucci, "Veep" ran for seven seasons between 2012 and 2017. The political satire series followed Former Senator Selina Meyer (Louis-Dreyfus), who gets an opportunity to serve as the Vice President of the US.</p>

<p>It also starred Anna Chlumsky, Reid Scott, Sarah Sutherland and Tony Hale.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sarees, tea cups, TV sets, paintings were among the many things stolen by protesters who stormed Sheikh Hasina's palace in Dhaka Monday.</p>

<p>Protests in Bangladesh that began as student-led demonstrations against government hiring rules in July culminated Monday in the prime minister fleeing and the military announcing it would form an interim government.</p>

<p>At least 300 people were killed in more than a month of deadly protests that ended the rule of 76-year-old Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.</p>

<p>The protests escalated despite the scheme being scaled back by Bangladesh's top court.</p>

<p>Bangladesh's Channel 24 broadcast images of crowds running into the compound, waving to the camera as they celebrated, looting furniture and books while others relaxed on beds.</p>

<p>Social media images showed jubilant protesters riffling through the drawers and her belongings.</p>

<p>Some pictures from the site showed the protesters enjoying a feast, others carrying a huge fish. A man was also seen wearing a saree, allegedly belonging to the former prime minister.</p>

<p>Protesters also smashed a statue of Hasina's father Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the country's independence hero.</p>

<p>The mobs also attacked the homes of Hasina's close allies, witnesses told news agency AFP.</p>

<p>Sheikh Hasina's 15 consecutive years in power were marked by an economic rebirth but also by the mass arrest of political opponents and human rights sanctions against her security forces.</p>

<p>Ms Hasina, 76, won a fifth term as prime minister in January but the opposition boycotted a vote it said was neither free nor fair, .</p>

<p>She promised last year to turn all of Bangladesh into a "prosperous and developed country" but around 18 million young Bangladeshis are out of work, according to government figures.</p>

<p>Bangladesh has a long history of coups.</p>

<p>The military declared an emergency in January 2007 after widespread political unrest and installed a military-backed caretaker government for two years.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former Bangladesh Prime Miniser Sheikh Hasina was seen fleeing from her residence in Dhaka in a chopper on Monday as her country was embroiled in violent clashes between anti-government and pro-government protesters that left over 300 dead.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards, Sheikh Hasina, 76, landed at the Hindon Air Force base in Ghaziabad, near Delhi, on a military aircraft. She is expected to leave for London, sources told NDTV.</p>

<p>This comes after the Bangladesh Army gave Sheikh Hasina 45 minutes to resign as her government was unable to control the violence and then took over to form an interim government.</p>

<p>"There is a crisis. I have met Opposition leaders and we have decided to form an interim government to run this country. I take all responsibility and promise to protect your life and property. Your demands will be fulfilled. Please stop the violence," Army chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman said in a televised speech.</p>

<p>Just hours earlier, protesters had reached Sheikh Hasina's residence, Ganabhaban, in Dhaka.</p>

<p>The violence began last month after students demanded the scrapping of a quota system that reserves up to 30 per cent of government jobs for family members of veterans who fought in Bangladesh's 1971 war against Pakistan.</p>

<p>Sheikh Hasina won her fourth consecutive term in January this year in a controversial election that was boycotted by Bangladesh's main opposition party, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, calling the polls a sham.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Protesters lounging on a bed and clicking selfies were among many visuals, being labelled as from inside the Bangladesh Prime Minister's official residence, which went viral online after Sheikh Hasina resigned and left her country. However, it turns out the visuals are two years old and show a scene from Sri Lanka President's palace.</p>

<p>In July 2022, angry protesters took over former Sri Lanka President Gotabaya Rajapaksa's official residence, a culmination of months of protests over the unprecedented economic crisis in the island nation. Like Ms Hasina, Mr Rajapaksa too fled his country before resigning from the top post.</p>

<p>Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina resigned today in a dramatic development amid massive protest against her government that claimed more than 100 lives in the last two days.</p>

<p>The announcement of her resignation came soon after hundreds of protesters defied an indefinite military curfew and stormed her official residence - 'Ganabhaban' - in the capital Dhaka. She had fled by then.</p>

<p>Several photos and videos on social media showed protesters vandalising and looting the building.&nbsp;Many were seen carrying away televisions, chairs and tables from what was one of the most protected buildings in the country.</p>

<p>The day witnessed chaotic scenes after supporters of the ruling Awami League descended on the streets to subdue the anti-government protests who defied curfew to gather for the "Long March to Dhaka".</p>

<p>Some protesters also climbed atop a large statue of independence leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, Ms Hasina's father, and began chiselling away at the head with an axe, the visuals showed.</p>

<p>At least 300 people were killed in more than a month of protests that ended the 15-year rule of Ms Hasina.</p>

<p>Bangladesh's army chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman said in a broadcast to the nation on state television on Monday Hasina had resigned and the military would form an interim government.</p>

<p>She has landed at the Hindon Air Force base in Uttar Pradesh's Ghaziabad. She is expected to leave for London soon.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An unruly mob on Monday damaged the Indira Gandhi Cultural Centre (IGCC) and the Bangabandhu Memorial Museum located at the Dhanmondi area in the Bangladesh capital, witnesses said.</p>

<p>The protesters on Monday afternoon set fire to several key locations in Dhaka, including Bangabandhu Bhaban, also known as the Bangabandhu Memorial Museum, at Dhanmondi 32, the Dhaka Tribune newspaper reported.</p>

<p>The museum was dedicated to Hasina's father Sheikh Mujibur Rahman who was assassinated while serving as president in 1975.</p>

<p>The Indira Gandhi Cultural Centre located in the same area was also damaged by the unruly mob, according to eyewitnesses.</p>

<p>The development comes as a massive protest forced Prime Minister Sheikh to resign and leave Bangladesh. Army Chief General Waqar-uz-Zaman announced that an interim government was being formed and urged protesters to end the violence.</p>

<p>The Centre, formally inaugurated in March 2010, promotes bilateral cultural linkages between India and Bangladesh by organising cultural programmes, cultural seminars, workshops and engaging India based Gurus professionals and trainers for Yoga, Hindi, Indian classical Vocal Music and Indian Dances such as Kathak and Manipuri.</p>

<p>It also engages high class professionals from Bangladesh who had their training from Indian Gurus or in Indian Universities.</p>

<p>The Centre, a Cultural Centre of the Indian Council for Cultural Relations of India, has a library with over 21,000 books in the fields of Indian art, culture, politics, economics and fiction.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel's far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich has ordered the seizure of 100 million shekels ($26 million) of tax funds intended for the Palestinian Authority, saying it would be used to pay for Israeli victims of terrorism.</p>

<p>In a statement issued late on Sunday, the finance ministry said the confiscation of funds was "part of measures to combat terrorism".</p>

<p>The statement quoted Smotrich as accusing the Palestinian Authority, which governs parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, of diverting the funds to the "families of terrorists".</p>

<p>Israeli politicians have regularly criticised the Ramallah-based Palestinian Authority for granting financial support to the families of Palestinians killed or jailed for acts of violence against Israel.</p>

<p>The finance ministry statement noted that this was the fifth time it had withheld funds, which Israel collects on behalf of the Palestinian Authority.</p>

<p>The Palestinian Authority did not immediately respond to AFP requests for comment.</p>

<p>Since Hamas's October 7 attack triggered the war in Gaza, Israel has imposed economic curbs on the Palestinian Authority, often withholding tax revenues it collects on its behalf.</p>

<p>Smotrich said on Monday on social media site X that the withholding of Palestinian funds was part of a broader strategy to prevent the creation of a Palestinian state "to ensure security" for Israelis, alongside increased settlement in the West Bank.</p>

<p>"We are working on the ground to remove this threat (of a Palestinian state) ... by strengthening settlement through construction, ... fighting the terror funds of the Palestinian Authority and its leaders, and maintaining complete Israeli control over the area."</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sheikh Hasina, 77, feted chief of the Awami League and three-time Prime Minister of Bangladesh, stepped down today amid a 45-minute ultimatum of the army and took&nbsp; a flight out of the violence-torn nation for an unknown destination. It would probably be familiar territory for a leader who started her political journey with an exile after the assassination of her father by officers of the Bangladesh army.</p>

<p>Sheikh Mujibur Rehman -- whose statue was vandalised in today's violence --&nbsp; was the charismatic leader who led East Pakistan to Independence and the birth of a new nation.</p>

<p>Sheikh Hasina, only 28 when Mujibur Rehman was assassinated, remained in exile from 1975 to late 1980s. While in exile, she rose through the ranks to head the party her father founded and on her return, dived into politics.</p>

<p>In 1996, she steered Awami League to victory in the national election, becoming the first woman Prime Minister of Bangladesh.</p>

<p>The initial years of her stewardship brought a phase of huge growth to Bangladesh in terms of both economy and infrastructure that led to rapid change in the living standards in what once was one of the world's poorest nations.</p>

<p>But her strained relationship with the judiciary and handling of an earlier series of protests gave rise to a generation of critics who accused her of totalitarianism and autocracy. Her victory in two subsequent elections saw widespread allegations of rigging – adding layers of controversy to one of the country's most prominent leaders of the time.</p>

<p>Sheikh Hasina's efforts to bring peace after 25 years of conflict in the Chittagong Hill Tracts was recognised by the UNESCO with the Houphouet-Boigny Peace Prize in 1998.</p>

<p>The current wave of student protests – which had started weeks ago as one about quota in government jobs to the families of freedom fighters – had unexpectedly snowballed into demands for her resignation.</p>

<p>As the violence continued, the army took action today, scripting what some see as the last chapter of the political career of the leader whose life has mirrored the ups and downs of the nation since her birth in 1947.</p>

<p>In her tumultuous career, Sheikh Hasina has faced grenade attacks and assassination attempts. She had been placed thrice under house arrest by the army, once over her opposition to the coup and assumption of power by. Lt. Gen. Hussain Muhammad Ershad. Many believe it is still too premature to compose her political epitaph.<br />

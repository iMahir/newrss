       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former US President Donald Trump once again sparked controversy by criticising two Olympic gold medalist female boxers, labelling them as men during a campaign rally in Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>Trump's remarks, made in the context of his pledge to "keep men out of women's sports," have reignited debates over gender and sports.</p>

<p>Referring to the athletes at the recently concluded Paris Olympics, Trump stated, "They were men. They transitioned to women, and they were in the boxing," adding that it is "so demeaning to women."</p>

<p>Trump's comments follow a pattern of his rallies where he has frequently targeted transgender athletes.</p>

<p>The two Olympic gold medalist athletes in question, Lin Yu-ting of Taiwan and Imane Khelif of Algeria have been at the centre of global scrutiny due to misconceptions about their gender.</p>

<p>Both athletes were disqualified from last year's Women's World Championships by the now-banned International Boxing Association (IBA) over alleged failures in gender eligibility tests, despite both being born and raised as women.</p>

<p>Khelif and Lin, who were cleared to compete in women's boxing at the Paris 2024 Olympics, had been disqualified from the Women's World Championships in India due to elevated testosterone levels, according to the IBA.</p>

<p>The IBA's decision, which stripped both boxers of their medals and barred them from women's competition, was widely criticised for its lack of transparency and fairness.</p>

<p>The International Olympic Committee (IOC), which is overseeing the boxing events in Paris, cleared both Lin and Khelif to compete in the Olympics, basing their eligibility on the athletes' passport gender.</p>

<p>The IOC condemned the harassment faced by Khelif, who has been subjected to online abuse and threats following the ruling by the IBA. Khelif spoke out against the bullying, warning of its potential to ruin lives.</p>

<p>Trump's repeated criticism of Khelif, including referring to her as a man, has drawn widespread condemnation from various quarters. His remarks come amidst ongoing debates about the inclusion of transgender athletes in sports, an issue that has polarised opinions across the globe.</p>

<p>The situation has highlighted the broader challenges faced by athletes like Khelif and Lin, who are caught in the crossfire of debates over gender, fairness, and the intersection of sports and identity.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Billionaire Elon Musk has compared Brazil's Chief Justice Alexandre de Moraes to the infamous Harry Potter villain, Lord Voldemort. The SpaceX CEO made the comparison in a tweet, which has since gone viral, featuring side-by-side images of Judge Moraes and Voldemort.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Judge Moraes is seen in a black cloak similar to that worn by Voldemort, who is wielding a wand in the other image. "The resemblance is uncanny. Alexandre de Voldemort," The Tesla CEO wrote in the caption on X.</p>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>An X user added fuel to the controversy by creating a&nbsp;video that transitioned Brazil's Chief Justice&nbsp;into Voldemort. The edited clip showed Mr Moraes rising in the air, cloaked in black, before morphing into the Harry Potter villain holding a wand. &nbsp;</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-media-max-width="560">

<p>This comparison comes on the heels of a major development involving X's operations in Brazil. On Saturday, the social media giant announced it would be shuttering its operations in the country, citing an ongoing legal battle with the Brazil Chief Justice as the primary reason. The shutdown was described as "effective immediately," although Brazilian users will still have access to the platform.</p>

<p>"We are deeply saddened that we have been forced to make this decision," X said in an official statement, placing the blame squarely on Moraes. The company claimed that the decision was a direct result of the actions of the Brazilian Supreme Court judge.&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Last night, Alexandre de Moraes threatened our legal representative in Brazil with arrest if we do not comply with his censorship orders. He did so in a secret order, which we share here to expose his actions.<br />

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>The legal conflict between X and Judge Moraes has been simmering for some time. Earlier this year, the judge ordered X to block certain accounts accused of spreading disinformation and hate speech, particularly those linked to supporters of former far-right President Jair Bolsonaro. Mr Bolsonaro had repeatedly cast doubt on the integrity of Brazil's electronic voting system, claiming it was vulnerable to fraud - a claim that fueled tensions leading up to the tightly contested 2022 election.&nbsp;<br />
Alexandre de Moraes, who also presides over Brazil's Superior Electoral Tribunal, has been a vocal advocate for combating disinformation. "Freedom of expression doesn't mean freedom of aggression," Mr Moraes has said in the past, as per an <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/8/17/elon-musks-x-to-shut-operations-in-brazil-amid-bitter-legal-fight">Al Jazeera</a> report. "It doesn't mean the freedom to defend tyranny."</p>

<p><br />
In the latest escalation, X claimed Mr Moraes secretly threatened one of its legal representatives in Brazil with arrest if it did not comply with legal orders to take down some content. "As a result, to protect the safety of our staff, we have made the decision to close our operation in Brazil," they said in their statement.&nbsp;<br />
Elon Musk, never one to shy away from controversy, doubled down on his criticism of Mr Moraes, calling him "an utter disgrace to justice" in a separate post on X.&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Due to demands by “Justice” <a href="https://twitter.com/alexandre?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Alexandre</a> in Brazil that would require us to break (in secret) Brazilian, Argentinian, American and international law, ???? has no choice but to close our local operations in Brazil.<br />

<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-08/hb13n3t8_imane-khelif_625x300_18_August_24.jpg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>The kind of bullying and abuse Olympic boxer Imane Khelif has been subjected to makes one thing crystal clear: in the age of social media, misinformation is easiest to amplify when it's rooted in misogyny, transphobia and racism, and amplified by verified, blue-ticked accounts on X. It has also made it clear that trans-hate will eventually come to haunt all women who do not fit traditional, conservative definitions of femininity.</p>

<p>Now that Imane Khelif has refused to take the online abuse in silence and is suing the key amplifiers - J.K. Rowling and Elon Musk - let's revisit the brutal online hate campaign unleashed against the Olympic gold medallist, all for being a 'non-feminine' woman of colour.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>The Prime Purveyors Of Hate</strong></h2>

<p>On August 1, after facing Khelif for a whopping 45-second battle, Italian boxer Angela Carini forfeited the match. Later, she would tell the press, "I have never been punched so hard" and shed tears in front of the camera, as anyone would have in her position. However, seeing a white woman cry on television was, of course, too much to bear for champions of women's rights like author J. K. Rowling, who has had a history of making transphobic comments. Rowling cried foul on X about a "man" punching a woman and about men's rights activism having gone too far. Even the owner of X, Elon Musk, could not resist chiming in. It's another story that Musk's own views about transgender persons are worth some scrutiny and may be best described by his estranged daughter who he refuses to acknowledge.</p>

<p>The Imane Khelif case underlines a hard but unsurprising truth: we are not as progressive in 2024 as we would like to believe. Sure, there are more people today who are accepting of queer rights, gender equality, and just human rights in general, but in the country called the internet, this population is sparse.</p>

<h2><strong>Trans Hate Is Misogyny</strong></h2>

<p>When two people with a combined following of over 200 million people put out such derogatory posts against a woman, their legions of followers are bound to spew out the same misinformation, often with vile language. But Rowling and Musk's comments also fanned the fire of deep-rooted transphobia and misogyny that still burns in all stratas of human classes, races, and nationalities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Trans hate is just another catalyst for overall misogyny. Groups abound on Reddit and Facebook where people aligned with the Rowling ideology simply attack any female celebrity they don't think is "woman enough" and must therefore, be a transsexual or transgender; there is a word for this group too, "transvestigators". &nbsp;For example, if you like to lift weights and be muscular, then you are not feminine, and hence make for a perfect target for these 'tranvestigators'. Like sports? Big cars? Not dainty, petite, blonde, and light-eyed enough? Wear too much makeup as if to hide male appearance? Wear too little makeup because you are a man trying to pass off as a 'sporty woman'? Well, women who exhibit such traits "aren't women", according to tranvestigators.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Coming back to the hate campaign against Khelif. Soon after her win in Paris and its fallout, conservative-leaning media outlets and social media handles started talking about her 2023 disqualification by the International Boxing Association (IBA) for failing a 'gender eligibility test'. No matter the fact that the IBA itself was questioned by the Olympics for their 'methods' and that there have been accusations of corruption as well. The International Olympic Association (IOC) banned the IBA last year over its governance and finance issues, with the Olympic body allowing the boxing competition to be held in Paris. But alas, this grain of truth was buried deep under the rubble of misinformation that flooded the internet.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A number of questions have been raised amid this storm. "How can 'he' be a woman?", "IBA must have banned 'him' for a reason!", "XY is a man! Only men have Testosterone!", "He clearly looks like a man. He is built like a man."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Let's try to answer them.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Man, Woman, Other?</strong></h2>

<p>Khelif's story is very <em>Dangal</em>-like. Indian audiences, if they read her full interview with UNICEF, may relate to the story of a young girl joining a sport that's dominated by men. But unlike <em>Dangal</em>, she did not have a father ready to fight the world. She fought mostly alone in her childhood, while her family battled poverty to feed their children and sustain the family.</p>

<p>There's also the fact that Algeria is a deeply religious Islamic country, where being trans may invite a host of legal challenges. If any of the 'tranvestigators' like Rowling or Musk followers had bothered to do a simple Google search, they would know Algeria would probably never send a 'trans' person to represent their country in the Olympics. &nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>XX or XY?</strong></h2>

<p>Doesn't matter, honestly. Anyone who has studied genetics and chromosomes can answer this: the set of chromosomes that define sex (not gender) are named so based on their shape. Zoya Fatima, a teacher at Jamia Senior Secondary School, explains that women have two chromosomes shaped like 'X', while in men, one of them is shaped like a 'Y'. "Genetic mutation can cause a foetus with XX to have a Y-shaped chromosome," she explains, "They can have all female genitalia, even uterus in some cases, but ovaries in almost all cases are non-functional. But they can be mothers via IVF and have normal pregnancies. So it is incorrect to say that all XY automatically classify as male and man."</p>

<p>If we were to go by the definitions recommended by conservative social media, then millions of women would immediately lose their right to be called a woman for having elevated testosterone levels. While testosterone is considered the 'male hormone', women produce it too - many with hormonal disorders, such as PCOS, tend to produce too much of it. Will these conditions void a woman's right to be called a 'woman'?&nbsp;</p>

<p>If we consider science for our definitions, the majority of women with XY or XXY or XXYY chromosomal structures have one common denominator: a non-functional ovary. So that begs the question, is a perfectly functional ovary fundamental for being classified as a 'woman'? If yes, what about a few thousand women who have ovarian insufficiency? Will they cease to be known as women?&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>The Question Of Race</strong></h2>

<p>Women of colour who don't fit conservative definitions of femininity have always had it worse. Barely a day before her match, Khelif's Hungarian opponent, Luca Hamori, posted an incendiary picture on Instagram that showed Khelif as a 'beast'. For centuries now, Black women have been mocked for their 'masculinity'. Not too far in India itself, sprinter Duttee Chand had been on the receiving end of primitive gender tests. "In 2014, I challenged the IOC's rule that a person with a higher testosterone level should not participate in the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Switzerland. It was noted that hormonal levels cannot increase athletic performance. I suffered a lot at that time. I faced a lot of controversy regarding my gender," Chand told <em>PTI </em>after the Imane Khelif controversy erupted.</p>

<p>The abuse and attacks Imane Khelif has faced online will be remembered for years to come. The key takeaway is this: misinformation driven by racist, misogynist ideologies often travels much, much faster than the truth.&nbsp;</p>

       <description><![CDATA[The enormous prints, spaced up to 75cm apart, are thought to have been made by a large herbivore from the late Triassic period.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A casual summer beach walk turned into a prehistoric adventure for a 10-year-old girl in the UK when she&nbsp;stumbled upon enormous footprints.&nbsp;While strolling along the shore with her mother in Penarth, Tegan stumbled upon five massive footprints, which dinosaur experts believe belong to a Camelot that roamed the area over 200 million years ago, <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c049pe7gx6do">BBC</a></em> reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The enormous prints, spaced up to 75cm apart, are thought to have been made by a large herbivore from the late Triassic period. Palaeontologists are now working to verify the discovery, with the National Museum Wales' palaeontology curator expressing confidence that the prints are genuine, leaving Tegan and her mother thrilled to have walked in the footsteps of dinosaurs.</p>

<p>"We've got five footprints and we're talking about half-to-three-quarters of a metre between each one. These footprints are so big, it would have to be a type of dinosaur called a sauropodomorpha,'' Cindy Howells told the BBC's The Dinohunters programme.</p>

<p>The incredible discovery was made on the South Wales coast, where&nbsp;the girl's mother Claire used to live.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"It was so cool and exciting. We were just out looking to see what we could find, we didn't think we'd find anything. We found these were big holes that looked like dinosaur footprints, so mum took some pictures, emailed the museum and it was from a long-necked dinosaur,'' said Tegan.</p>

<p>Following the remarkable discovery, Claire reached out to Cindy via email just a few days later. The dinosaur footprints had been found embedded in red siltstone at Lavernock Point, a location situated between Cardiff and Barry along the Glamorgan Heritage Coast.</p>

<p>Cindy, a seasoned dinosaur expert with 40 years of experience in the region, was convinced of the authenticity of the footprints due to the consistent stride pattern. "What's telling is the alternating left and right feet, with a consistent distance between them. If they were just random holes, we'd be sceptical, but this pattern suggests a deliberate gait. It's a significant discovery, and the excitement is palpable when someone contacts us with a confirmed dinosaur find - it's truly thrilling'', she explained.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"It's hard to comprehend you're walking on the same beach that hundreds of millions of years ago some massive prehistoric animal was here. You can spend a lifetime looking for dinosaur treasures so for it to happen for Tegan at this age is great,'' she added.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[This pledge comes just ahead of the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, where Ms Harris is set to step onto the stage as the party's official presidential nominee]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US&nbsp;Vice-President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, shared a childhood photo of her and her mother, revealing that as a teenager she worked at fast food chains to earn money.</p>

<p>In a heartfelt social media post, the 59-year-old recalled her childhood growing up in a middle-class household, where her mother “saved for over a decade to buy a home”. “I was a teenager when the day finally came—and I can still remember how excited she was,” she revealed in a post on X. Ms Harris also shared her own experience working at McDonald's in college to “earn spending money.”</p>

<p>“That only gets harder when the cost of living goes up,” she said, underlining the increasing struggles faced by many Americans when the cost of living increases, promising to make it a top priority to bring down costs and “increase economic security” for all if she is elected President.&nbsp;</p>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>This pledge comes just ahead of the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, where Ms Harris is set to step onto the stage as the party's official presidential nominee. Her candidacy was cemented after receiving overwhelming support in a virtual roll call of delegates, as confirmed by the <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/kamala-harris-nominee-DNC-majority-democratic-roll-call-votes/story?id=112580918" target="_blank">Democratic National Committee</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, with the convention fast approaching, voters are keen to understand where the Democratic presidential nominee stands on key issues. Kamala Harris' stance on economic issues includes supporting policies that benefit the middle class, such as mortgage assistance and tax credits for parents, as per <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx924r4d5yno" target="_blank">BBC</a>. On immigration, Ms Harris has shifted towards bipartisan border security solutions, addressing the root causes of migration from Central America.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ukraine and Russia were on the brink of engaging in indirect ceasefire negotiations in Qatar's Doha this month. The discussions, mediated by Qatar, aimed at halting the destructive strikes on energy and power infrastructure that have plagued both countries since the conflict began. However, a diplomatic breakthrough, which could have marked de-escalation in the ongoing war, was derailed by Ukraine's surprise ground offensive in Russia's western Kursk region, the Washington Post <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/08/17/kursk-ukraine-russia-energy-ceasefire/">reported</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to the report, both Kyiv and Moscow had signalled their willingness to negotiate an agreement that would stop the relentless attacks on their respective energy grids - an issue that has caused widespread suffering and economic turmoil on both sides.</p>

<p>However, Ukraine's sudden incursion into Kursk, a strategic region where Kyiv has been intensifying its military operations, threw these plans into disarray. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky confirmed on Saturday that his forces were consolidating their positions in Kursk, which has been a focal point of Ukrainian military efforts for over 11 days. This offensive, intended to disrupt Russian supply routes and troop movements, coincided with Moscow's accusations that Ukraine had destroyed a key bridge in the area.</p>

<p>The report claimed that a diplomat briefed on the situation noted that Russian officials viewed the incursion as an "escalation" and postponed their meeting with Qatari mediators. While the Russian delegation did not officially cancel the talks, they requested more time to reassess their position. In response Qatar decided to delay the summit.</p>

<p>There have been previous attempts at diplomacy, including secret talks in Istanbul and the United Nations but they ultimately collapsed due to continued military aggression from both sides.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russia's Shiveluch volcano in the Kamchatka region erupted after a 7.0 magnitude earthquake that struck off the eastern coast of the country, local media reported on Sunday.</p>

<p>The volcano has started to "spew ash and lava", the state-owned TASS news agency reported, citing the Institute of Volcanology and Seismology of the Far Eastern Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences.</p>

<p>"The eruption of the Shiveluch volcano has begun... According to visual evaluations, the ash column is rising as high as 8 kilometres above the sea level," the report quoted scientists as saying.</p>

<p>Earlier on Saturday night (local time), a 7.0-magnitude earthquake jolted a sea area off the east coast of Kamchatka.</p>

<p>The epicentre was monitored at 52.8 degrees north latitude and 160.15 degrees east longitude. The quake struck at a depth of 50 km, according to a report issued by the China Earthquake Networks Center.</p>

<p>The US National Tsunami Warning Center had initially issued a tsunami threat but later said the threat had passed. The Russian Emergencies Ministry had not issued any tsunami warning.</p>

<p>The earthquake was followed by a series of aftershocks in the Pacific Ocean off Kamchatka, measuring between 3.9 and 5.0. Most of them were not felt on the land, TASS reported, citing the ministry.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A woman from Brooklyn, United States, who fell from a golf cart is suing Hard Rock Cafe &amp; Hotel in the Dominican Republic for $500,000 (Rs 4 crore). Taylor O'Leary claimed in the complaint that she suffered several injuries after she fell out of her golf cart in July 2022 because the seat was wet and slippery, as per a report in the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/08/17/us-news/nyc-woman-sues-hard-rock-for-500k-after-falling-out-of-golf-cart/"><em>New York Post.</em></a></p>

<p>The incident happened at the Hard Rock Golf Club in Punta Cana. According to the lawsuit, the 27-year-old, who was a guest at the hotel, filed the complaint against the establishment and its corporate owner, Hard Rock Cafe International.</p>

<p>Celebrities like Justin Bieber, Shakira, and Mariah Carey are said to love this five-star luxury resort, which is located along Macao Beach.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in June, a Disneyland employee died two days after suffering a head injury in a golf cart accident, as per a report in The Hollywood Reporter. The 60-year-old woman named Bonnye Mavis Lear was in the backstage area of the California theme park when the incident occurred.</p>

<p>Anaheim Police and Anaheim Fire and Rescue personnel arrived at the resort on Wednesday after they were informed about the accident. She was sitting as a passenger and struck her head after falling from the moving cart. The 60-year-old was then taken to a local hospital in grave condition.</p>

<p>The 60-year-old worked for 24 years at the Disneyland Resort, where she "supported membership services at Club 33," the park's exclusive private dining club.</p>

<p>Disney California Adventure Attractions cast member Rae Delgado, wrote on Facebook that Ms Lear suffered brain swelling and a fractured skull from the accident. "Bonnye was travelling on a rear-facing seat of a golf cart along with 3 passengers behind Critter Country. The driver of the vehicle was driving at least 20 mph on the route. The golf cart came in contact with a bump/dip in the road which caused Bonnye to react immediately. As she went to grab the handrail, it gave way and sent her out of the vehicle. ... She was deemed unconscious when paramedics arrived."</p>

<p>Despite the surgery, "it was beyond repair," according to the employee, and Ms Lear was pronounced "brain dead".</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An unrelentingly bitter US presidential race, defined by name-calling, attack ads and stunted campaigning, has so far left little space for discussion about climate change, despite the world experiencing unprecedented heat and disasters.</p>

<p>But with Donald Trump now facing Kamala Harris rather than Joe Biden, the Republican has used recent rallies to echo misinformation and memes on X, including fictional bans on red meat and gas stoves.</p>

<p>The aim? To undermine Harris.</p>

<p>"Kamala called for slashing consumption of red meat to fight climate change," Trump said during a July 27 rally in the state of Minnesota.</p>

<p>The Democratic nominee would "get rid of all cows ... and I guess that at some point, they'll go after the humans," the former president added, echoing "depopulation" conspiracy theories that have plagued Harris in right-wing spaces since she waded into the topic of "climate anxiety" among younger generations at a White House press conference last year.</p>

<p>JD Vance, Trump's running mate, amplified the claims in an August 3 speech in Atlanta, saying Harris "wants to take away your gas stoves, she even wants to take away your ability to eat red meat."</p>

<p>Such climate myths took on a life of their own on X, encouraged by conservative commentators in swing states and MAGA accounts with hundreds of thousands of followers.</p>

<p>However, Harris made no such campaign promise.</p>

<p>She has cooked with a gas stove herself and noted in a 2019 environmental panel that she "love(s) cheeseburgers from time to time," although she has supported the idea of updating dietary guidelines.</p>

<p>"A tried-and-true tactic in politics is to misrepresent your opponent's positions to make them sound extreme and unacceptable. Trump and Vance are doing exactly that with Vice President Harris's positions on climate action," said Edward Maibach, director of George Mason University's Center for Climate Change Communication.</p>

<h3><strong>Harris's climate record&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>The false narratives add to Trump and Vance's criticism of the vice president's stance on issues such as fracking, a violently disruptive underground oil and gas extraction technique.</p>

<p>Harris initially advocated banning the practice in 2019 before becoming Biden's running mate in 2020. She has more recently sought to avoid questions about it, particularly in the crucial swing state of Pennsylvania where fracking is big business.</p>

<p>Still, climate activists have mostly saluted Harris, whose environmental stance has historically been to the left of the president -- notably in going after oil companies as California attorney general.</p>

<p>The Biden administration also pushed a renewable energy shift in passing the Inflation Reduction Act, the largest investment in reducing carbon pollution in US history.</p>

<p>Trump has vehemently opposed the legislation, adopting the slogan "drill, baby, drill" to sum up his fossil fuel-friendly approach.</p>

<p>The League of Conservation Voters, an environmental advocacy group, told AFP the Trump campaign's amplification of misinformation on "widespread bans" constitutes "ridiculous scare tactics" perpetrated to undermine recent "climate progress."</p>

<h3><strong>Potential to 'backfire'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Responding to AFP's request for comment, Harris spokeswoman Lauren Hitt did not address specific claims from Trump and his running mate, but said the Democrat "is focused on a future where all Americans have clean air, clean water, and affordable, reliable energy."</p>

<p>Trump, meanwhile, has repeatedly dismissed the threats of climate change.</p>

<p>"The biggest threat is not global warming, where the ocean is going to rise one-eighth of an inch over the next 400 years," he told Elon Musk on X in mid-August. Musk officially endorsed Trump in July.</p>

<p>More than a third of registered voters disagree, saying global warming is very important to their vote in the 2024 election, according to a recent survey from the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication.</p>

<p>"I suspect the tactic will backfire with a relatively smaller number of uncommitted voters, most of whom are concerned about climate change," Maibach said.</p>

<p>"Trump and Vance attacking VP Harris on her climate positions will hurt them more than help them."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former US President Donald Trump has claimed at an election rally that he is "much better looking" than his Democratic rival for the White House, Vice-President Kamala Harris.</p>

<p>"I am much better looking than her. I think I'm a better-looking person than Kamala," Trump said at an election rally in Pennsylvania, which is one of the battleground states that will determine the race.</p>

<p>Trump appears to have been triggered by a column in The Wall Street Journal that described Harris as beautiful. "You can't take a bad picture of her. Her beauty, plus the social warmth that all who have known her over the years speak of, combines to produce: radiance," Peggy Noonan, the columnist, had written.</p>

<p>Trump leaned into it by calling out to a Republican who is running for US Senate from the state. "You're not allowed to say this anymore. You know, David, don't ever get caught in this trap," Trump said addressing Republican Senate candidate David McCormick in the audience. "David, please don't ever call a woman beautiful, because that will be the end of your political career."</p>

<p>"I am much better looking than her. I'm a better-looking person than Kamala," he said and went on to belittle a sketch of her on a Time magazine cover. He said he thought it was actresses Sophia Loren or Elizabeth Taylor.</p>

<p>Former President Trump also attacked Harris on policy calling the economic plan she announced on Friday as a plan that "will usher communism in the US". He has called it the "Maduro plan", after Nicolas Maduro, the Venezuelan leader.</p>

<p>Trump has used a string of personal slurs against Harris in the last three weeks. He has called her "crazy" and a "lunatic", questioned her ethnicity, and even stated that he is "entitled" to these personal attacks because she makes him angry and she has also attacked him as "weird".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Is America ready to elect a Black woman as its president? Vice President Kamala Harris, who will be officially confirmed as the Democratic US presidential nominee in Chicago next week, is betting that it is.</p>

<p>"In my entire career, I've heard people say when I ran... people aren't ready, it's not your time, nobody like you has done that before," the Democrat said in 2019 when she ran against Joe Biden in the primary presidential campaign.</p>

<p>"I haven't listened and I would suggest that nobody should listen to that kind of conversation."</p>

<p>But Harris's campaign never took off and she left the primaries race before Biden picked her as his running mate.</p>

<p>If Harris, 59, manages to beat Donald Trump in November, she will become the first woman and the second Black person, after Barack Obama, to run the world's leading power.</p>

<h3><strong>Trailblazer&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>In so many ways, Harris already is a trailblazer. Born to an Indian mother and a Jamaican father, she was the first woman attorney general ever elected in California, on top of being the first African American and Asian American to hold that post. She then became the first vice president in US history in those same categories.</p>

<p>In a survey published in September 2023, the Pew Research Center, a Washington-based think tank, found that for a majority of Americans, gender does not play a role in choosing a president.</p>

<p>Sixty per cent of respondents said that a female president would handle pressure as well as a man, while 27 per cent believed that she would do better.</p>

<p>"While female leadership -- whether as presidents, queens, prime ministers, and heads of state -- has become the norm in many parts of the world, including Europe, Asia, South America, and African nations, the United States has yet to experience this moment," said Sonia Gipson Rankin, a law professor at the University of New Mexico.</p>

<p>She noted that even though Democrat Hillary Clinton lost the electoral college and therefore the presidency to Trump in 2016, she won the popular vote.</p>

<h3><strong>Strategic discrimination&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Regina Bateson, a professor of political science at the University of Colorado Boulder, believes that voters' biases may not themselves be the issue.</p>

<p>"The problem is often not that voters are actually biased," Bateson said. "It's that party insiders and delegates and political donors worry that the voters will be biased."</p>

<p>That leads them to withhold support from a woman of colour, a phenomenon that Bateson calls "strategic discrimination," which usually manifests itself during the primaries when a candidate must demonstrate that he or she is able to rally many groups of voters.</p>

<p>Harris, however, took over from Biden after the 81-year-old leader withdrew from the race, thus sparing her "this process of trying to convince people that she's electable" during the primaries.</p>

<p>Flanked by her running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, a 60-year-old white man, Harris now hopes to win the trust of all Americans, regardless of ethnicity or gender.</p>

<p>Some are already convinced such as "White dudes for Harris," a group that brought nearly 200,000 people together for a Zoom fundraiser for Harris in late July, raising more than $4 million.</p>

<p>Donald Trump didn't wait long to attack his Democratic rival on her background.</p>

<p>The billionaire charged that Harris "turned Black" only recently in order to win electoral support.</p>

<p>Harris, who had always spoken of her Black and Asian heritage with pride, called out Trump for his "divisiveness and disrespect."</p>

<p>The former president's running mate, J.D. Vance, caused an outcry recently when a 2021 video resurfaced in which he dismisses the Democratic Party as being run by "a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives... and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable too."</p>

<p>Harris is married to Douglas Emhoff and helped in raising his two children from a previous marriage. She does not have any biological children of her own.</p>

<p>Vance's comments caused a backlash amplified by Hollywood stars such as Jennifer Aniston and Glenn Close, and were widely considered a political misstep in a country where the fertility rate is historically low.</p>

<p>Vance has sought to walk back his remarks saying they were taken out of context.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[For the first time, the UK government is planning to treat extreme misogyny as a form of terrorism, the Telegraph reported.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For the first time, the UK government is planning to treat extreme misogyny as a form of terrorism, the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2024/08/17/extreme-misogyny-treated-as-terrorism-government/">Telegraph </a>reported.</p>

<p>To tackle growing incidents of violence against women and girls, UK home secretary Yvette Cooper has ordered a review of the counter-terrorism strategy which will help identify gaps in current laws and also study emerging ideologies especially online misogynistic discourse.</p>

<p>This move will look at violence against women in the same way as far-right extremism.</p>

<p>Under the suggested legislation, it would be mandatory for school teachers to refer students they suspect of extreme misogyny to the government's counter-terror programme.</p>

<p>Anyone who is referred to the programme is assessed by local police to see if they show signs of radicalistaion and need to be deradicalised.</p>

<p>This comes after reports warned that misogynistic influencers like Andrew Tate are radicalising teenage boys online in the same way terrorist draw in their followers.</p>

<p>Last year, counter-extremism workers warned of a rise in the number of cases being referred to them by schools concerned about the his influence. The reports included incidents of verbal harassment of female teachers or other students which reflected the influencer's views.</p>

<p>The UK Home Ministry has several extremism categories marked as areas of "concern" and this includes a category for "incel" - an abbreviation of the term "involuntary celibate" - which refers to a misogynistic view that blames women for men's failure to get sexual opportunities.</p>

<p>UK officials now fear that this category does not capture other forms of extreme misogyny.</p>

<p>"For too long, governments have failed to address the rise in extremism, both online and on our streets, and we've seen the number of young people radicalised online grow. Hateful incitement of all kinds fractures and frays the very fabric of our communities and our democracy," Ms Cooper told the Telegraph.</p>

<p>Last month, UK's National Police Chiefs' Council published a report on violence against women and girls labelling it as a national emergency.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For the first time, the UK government is planning to treat extreme misogyny as a form of terrorism, the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2024/08/17/extreme-misogyny-treated-as-terrorism-government/">Telegraph </a>reported.</p>

<p>To tackle growing incidents of violence against women and girls, UK home secretary Yvette Cooper has ordered a review of the counter-terrorism strategy which will help identify gaps in current laws and also study emerging ideologies especially online misogynistic discourse.</p>

<p>This move will look at violence against women in the same way as far-right extremism.</p>

<p>Under the suggested legislation, it would be mandatory for school teachers to refer students they suspect of extreme misogyny to the government's counter-terror programme.</p>

<p>Anyone who is referred to the programme is assessed by local police to see if they show signs of radicalistaion and need to be deradicalised.</p>

<p>This comes after reports warned that misogynistic influencers like Andrew Tate are radicalising teenage boys online in the same way terrorist draw in their followers.</p>

<p>Last year, counter-extremism workers warned of a rise in the number of cases being referred to them by schools concerned about the his influence. The reports included incidents of verbal harassment of female teachers or other students which reflected the influencer's views.</p>

<p>The UK Home Ministry has several extremism categories marked as areas of "concern" and this includes a category for "incel" - an abbreviation of the term "involuntary celibate" - which refers to a misogynistic view that blames women for men's failure to get sexual opportunities.</p>

<p>UK officials now fear that this category does not capture other forms of extreme misogyny.</p>

<p>"For too long, governments have failed to address the rise in extremism, both online and on our streets, and we've seen the number of young people radicalised online grow. Hateful incitement of all kinds fractures and frays the very fabric of our communities and our democracy," Ms Cooper told the Telegraph.</p>

<p>Last month, UK's National Police Chiefs' Council published a report on violence against women and girls labelling it as a national emergency.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A senior Hamas official on Saturday dismissed optimistic talk by US President Joe Biden that a Gaza truce is nearer after negotiations in the Gulf emirate of Qatar.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A senior Hamas official on Saturday dismissed optimistic talk by US President Joe Biden that a Gaza truce is nearer after negotiations in the Gulf emirate of Qatar.</p>

<p>"To say that we are getting close to a deal is an illusion," Hamas political bureau member Sami Abu Zuhri told AFP. "We are not facing a deal or real negotiations, but rather the imposing of American diktats."</p>

<p>He was responding to Biden's comment Friday that "We are closer than we have ever been."</p>

<p>Biden spoke after two days of talks in Qatar where Washington tried to bridge differences between Israel and Palestinian group Hamas which have been at war for more than 10 months in the Gaza Strip.</p>

<p>Previous optimism during months of on-off truce talks has proven unfounded.</p>

<p>But the stakes have risen significantly since the late July killings in quick succession of Fuad Shukr, a top operations chief of Lebanon's Iran-backed Hezbollah movement, and Hamas political chief Ismail Haniyeh.</p>

<p>Their deaths prompted promises of retaliation from Iran and Hezbollah and fears of a wider Middle East war.</p>

<p>Trying to avert a broader conflict, Western and Arab diplomats have been shuttling around the region to push for a Gaza deal which they say could help avert a wider conflagration.</p>

<p>US Secretary of State Antony Blinken is headed back to the region this weekend in a bid to help seal a deal.</p>

<p>Hamas officials have objected to "new conditions" from Israel in the latest proposal drawn up by Washington.</p>

<p>Israel's delegation expressed "cautious optimism" about the prospects for an agreement after returning from Doha, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said Saturday.</p>

<p>"There is hope that the heavy pressure on Hamas from the United States and mediators will lead to the removal of their opposition to the American proposal, potentially allowing a breakthrough in the negotiations," it said.</p>

<p>In a joint statement, the foreign ministers of Britain, France, Germany and Italy urged all parties to "engage positively and flexibly" in the negotiations.</p>

<p>"We underline the importance of avoiding any escalatory action in the region which would undermine the prospect for peace," they added.</p>

<p>"There is too much at stake."</p>

<h3><strong>Strikes in Lebanon, Gaza</strong></h3>

<p>As efforts towards a truce continued, so did the killing in Gaza and Lebanon.</p>

<p>Lebanon's health ministry said an Israeli air strike in the southern Nabatieh area killed 10 Syrians, including a woman and her two children.</p>

<p>The strike was among the deadliest in south Lebanon since the onset of near-daily exchanges of fire between Israel and Hezbollah following the start of the Gaza war.</p>

<p>Israel's military said it struck a Hezbollah weapons storage facility.</p>

<p>In Hamas-run Gaza, the civil defence authority said an Israeli air strike killed 15 people from a single Palestinian family. The deaths in Al-Zawaida helped push the Gaza health ministry's war death count to 40,074.</p>

<p>"We are in the morgue seeing indescribable scenes of limbs and severed heads and children who are dismembered," said Omar al-Dreemli, a relative.</p>

<p>Israel's military told AFP that overnight its forces had struck "terrorist infrastructure" in central Gaza from which rockets were being fired.</p>

<p>"Reports were received that as a result of the strike, civilians in an adjacent structure were killed. The incident is under review," it said.</p>

<p>The war has destroyed much of Gaza's housing and healthcare infrastructure, leaving children vulnerable to preventable diseases.</p>

<p>The United Nations appealed Friday for seven-day pauses in the fighting so it could vaccinate children against polio, as the Palestinian health ministry reported Gaza's first polio case in 25 years.</p>

<h3><strong>'Bring them home'</strong></h3>

<p>Hamas's unprecedented October 7 attack on Israel that triggered the war resulted in the deaths of 1,198 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures.</p>

<p>Hamas also seized 251 hostages, 111 of whom are still held in Gaza, including 39 the military says are dead. More than 100 were freed during a one-week truce in November.</p>

<p>The Israeli military says 332 soldiers have been killed in the Gaza campaign since the ground offensive began on October 27.</p>

<p>In Israel, Blinken will seek to "conclude the agreement for a ceasefire and release of hostages and detainees", the State Department said.</p>

<p>Egyptian, Qatari and US mediators are working to finalise details of a framework agreement initially outlined by Biden in May. He said Israel had proposed it.</p>

<p>Thousands rallied in Tel Aviv and other Israeli cities on Saturday demanding a deal that would bring home the remaining Gaza hostages.</p>

<p>"We all know there's a real possibility for a deal," said Mor Korngold, hostage Tal Shoham's brother.</p>

<p>"These are crucial hours for my brother, for the hostages, for the soldiers, for those displaced from their homes, for the entire country."</p>

<p>In a joint statement after two days of talks in Qatar, the mediators said they would meet in Cairo "before the end of next week", hoping to seal an agreement.</p>

<h3><strong>Gazans on the move again</strong></h3>

<p>As truce talks took place, thousands of civilians were on the move again after the Israeli military issued fresh evacuation orders ahead of imminent action in central-southern Gaza.</p>

<p>"During each round of negotiations, they exert pressure by forcing evacuations and committing massacres," said Issa Murad, a Palestinian displaced to Deir el-Balah.</p>

<p>Over the past day, troops expanded operations around Gaza's main southern city of Khan Yunis including by "eliminating" Hamas who had fired munitions toward Nirim, just outside Gaza, Israel's military said Saturday.</p>

<p>Witnesses told AFP air strikes hit the Hamad residential towers in the city's northwest.</p>

<p>In the occupied West Bank, Palestinian officials said two people were killed in an Israeli air strike on a car in the northern city of Jenin that Israel's military said targeted a "terrorist cell".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Palestinian officials said two people were killed in an Israeli air strike in the occupied West Bank on Saturday that the Israeli military said targeted a "terrorist cell" in the Jenin area.</p>

<p>"Two bodies were transferred to Jenin public hospital after the occupiers (Israeli forces) bombed a car in the centre of the city," the Palestinian health ministry said in a statement.</p>

<p>The official Palestinian news agency Wafa reported that the strike was carried out by an "Israeli drone".</p>

<p>The military said in a statement that it had carried out an "air strike on a terrorist cell in the Jenin area".</p>

<p>Video footage posted online showed a vehicle on fire in the middle of a street, while some images showed a crowd around a charred car, trying to open the doors.</p>

<p>"There are dead people in the car," shouts a man as a stretcher is brought by rescue workers.</p>

<p>Since Hamas's unprecedented attack on Israel on October 7, violence has flared in the West Bank, a Palestinian territory occupied by Israel since 1967 and separated geographically from Gaza by Israeli territory.</p>

<p>Since October 7, at least 635 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank by Israeli troops or settlers, according to an AFP count based on Palestinian official figures.</p>

<p>During the same period, at least 18 Israelis, including soldiers, have been killed in Palestinian attacks, according to Israeli official figures.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A magnitude 7.0 earthquake struck off the coast of Russia's far-eastern Kamchatka Peninsula early Sunday morning local time, according to the regional earthquake monitoring service.</p>

<p>The local emergencies ministry said tremors were felt along the coast including in the region's capital Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky.</p>

<p>"Operational teams of rescuers and firefighters are inspecting buildings," the regional branch of Russia's emergencies ministry in the Kamchatka region said on Telegram.</p>

<p>The earthquake struck at a depth of nearly 50 kilometres (30 miles) just after 7:00 am local time, some 90 kilometres east of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, the United States Geological Survey reported.</p>

<p>The US National Tsunami Warning Center had initially issued a tsunami threat, but later said the threat had passed. Local authorities never issued a tsunami alert.</p>

<p>Several aftershocks were recorded after the initial quake, but of lower intensity, the Kamchatka branch of Russia's Unified Geophysical Service reported on its website.</p>

<p>The peninsula lies on a seismically active belt surrounding most of the Pacific Ocean known as the "Ring of Fire", and is home to more than two dozen active volcanoes.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gaza has recorded its first polio case in 25 years, the Palestinian health ministry said on Friday, after UN chief Antonio Guterres called for pauses in the Israel-Hamas war to vaccinate hundreds of thousands of children.</p>

<p>Tests in Jordan confirmed the disease in an unvaccinated 10-month-old from the central Gaza Strip, the health ministry in Ramallah said.</p>

<p>According to the United Nations, Gaza, now in its 11th month of war, has not registered a polio case for 25 years, although type 2 poliovirus was detected in samples collected from the territory's wastewater in June.</p>

<p>"Doctors suspected the presence of symptoms consistent with polio," the health ministry said. "After conducting the necessary tests in the Jordanian capital, Amman, the infection was confirmed."</p>

<p>The case emerged shortly after Guterres called for two seven-day breaks in the Gaza war to vaccinate more than 640,000 children.</p>

<p>Poliovirus, most often spread through sewage and contaminated water, is highly infectious. It can cause deformities and paralysis and is potentially fatal. It mainly affects children under the age of five.</p>

<p>The UN health and children's agencies said they had made detailed plans to reach children across the besieged Palestinian territory and could start this month.</p>

<p>But that would require pauses in the 10-month old war between Israel and Hamas, they said.</p>

<p>"Preventing and containing the spread of polio will take a massive, coordinated and urgent effort," Guterres told reporters at UN headquarters in New York.</p>

<p>"I am appealing to all parties to provide concrete assurances right away guaranteeing humanitarian pauses for the campaign."</p>

<p>The World Health Organization and UN children's fund UNICEF said they were planning two seven-day vaccination drives across the Gaza Strip, starting in late August, against type 2 poliovirus (cVDPV2).</p>

<p>Last month, it was announced that type 2 poliovirus had been detected in samples collected in Gaza on June 23.</p>

<p>"These pauses in fighting would allow children and families to safely reach health facilities and community outreach workers to get to children who cannot access health facilities for polio vaccination," the agencies said in a statement said.</p>

<h3><strong>Regional public health issue</strong></h3>

<p>After 25 years without polio, its re-emergence in the Gaza Strip would threaten neighbouring countries, it added.</p>

<p>"A ceasefire is the only way to ensure public health security in the Gaza Strip and the region."</p>

<p>During each round of the campaign, the health ministry in Gaza, alongside UN agencies, would provide "two drops of novel oral polio vaccine type 2 (nOPV2) to more than 640,000 children under 10 years of age".</p>

<p>More than 1.6 million doses of nOPV2 were expected to transit through Israel's Ben Gurion Airport "by the end of August", the statement added.</p>

<p>The war was triggered by Hamas's unprecedented October 7 attack on Israel which resulted in the deaths of 1,198 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures.</p>

<p>On Thursday, the toll from Israel's retaliatory military campaign in Gaza passed 40,000, according to the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza, which does not provide a breakdown of civilian and Hamas casualties.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The UN's nuclear watchdog warned on Saturday that the safety situation at Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant was "deteriorating" following a nearby drone strike.</p>

<p>Earlier on Saturday, Russia accused Ukraine of dropping an explosive charge on a road near the occupied plant in southern Ukraine.</p>

<p>The plant, which was seized by Russia's forces early in the war, has come under repeated attacks that both sides have accused each other of carrying out.</p>

<p>International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) experts on site were informed of the detonation near essential plant facilities on Saturday and immediately visited the area, the agency said in a statement.</p>

<p>They reported that the damage "seemed to have been caused by a drone equipped with an explosive payload," impacting the road between the plant's two main gates.</p>

<p>"Yet again we see an escalation of the nuclear safety and security dangers facing the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant," IAEA head Rafael Grossi said in the statement.</p>

<p>"I remain extremely concerned and reiterate my call for maximum restraint from all sides," he said.</p>

<p>The "nuclear safety situation" at the plant was "deteriorating," the statement added.</p>

<p>The IAEA team on site reported "intense" military activity over the past week in the area, including very close to the plant, it added.</p>

<p>"The team has heard frequent explosions, repetitive heavy machine gun and rifle fire and artillery at various distances from the plant," it said.</p>

<p>Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the IAEA has repeatedly urged restraint, saying it fears reckless military action could trigger a major nuclear accident at the plant.</p>

<p>Kyiv and Moscow traded blame last weekend after a fire broke out at a cooling tower at the plant.</p>

<p>IAEA experts were able to visit the base of the cooling tower but have requested further access to assess the situation, according to the Vienna-based IAEA.</p>

<p>The fire resulted in "considerable damage", but there was no immediate threat to nuclear safety, the agency said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Republican Donald Trump said on Saturday he believed Democrat Kamala Harris will be easier to beat than President Joe Biden even as some polls showed her edging ahead in the race for the Nov. 5 presidential election.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said on Saturday he believed Democrat Kamala Harris will be easier to beat than President Joe Biden even as some polls showed her edging ahead in the race for the Nov. 5 presidential election.</p>

<p>Trump, the former president, spoke at a rally in Wilkes-Barre in northeastern Pennsylvania, a state looming large in the campaign. Vice President Harris will conduct a bus tour of western Pennsylvania starting in Pittsburgh on Sunday, ahead of the kickoff of the Democratic National Convention on Monday in Chicago.</p>

<p>"I believe she will be easier to beat than him," said Trump, referring to her as "radical" and a "lunatic."</p>

<p>Trump has sought to portray Harris as far left on a number of policies. At the rally, he highlighted her previous call for a ban on fracking, an industry important to the state. Harris' campaign has recently indicated she would not support a ban.</p>

<p>He also continued to attack Harris on personal terms, even as some political analysts say such comments could hurt Trump with moderate voters.</p>

<p>"Have you heard her laugh? That is the laugh of a crazy person," Trump said, adding that he was displeased by the illustration of Harris on the cover of the latest issue of Time magazine. "I'm much better looking than her."</p>

<p>In a meandering speech, Trump repeated his false claim that he lost the 2020 election due to fraud, dismissed the threat of climate change and said his plan to impose across-the-board tariffs on foreign goods would not act as a tax on U.S. consumers, an assertion that most economists contest.</p>

<p>The Mohegan Sun Arena, where Trump appeared, has a capacity of roughly 8,000 and was nearly full when he started speaking. But the crowd began to thin after the one-hour mark. He spoke for more than 100 minutes in total.</p>

<p>Pennsylvania was one of three Rust Belt states, along with Wisconsin and Michigan, that helped power Trump's upset victory in 2016. Biden, who grew up in Scranton, Pennsylvania, flipped the trio back to the Democrats in 2020.</p>

<p>With 19 electoral votes out of the 270 needed to secure the White House, compared with 15 in Michigan and 10 in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania may be the biggest prize in this year's election and potentially tip the balance for either candidate.</p>

<p>Harris' entry into the race after Biden ended his reelection bid last month has upended the contest, erasing the lead Trump built in the final weeks of Biden's campaign. Harris is leading Trump by more than two percentage points in Pennsylvania, according to the poll tracking website FiveThirtyEight.</p>

<h3><strong>BLANKETING AIRWAVES WITH ADS</strong></h3>

<p>Trump won Pennsylvania in 2016 by about 44,000 votes, a margin of less than one percentage point, while Biden prevailed by just over 80,000 votes in 2020, a 1.2-point margin.</p>

<p>Both campaigns have made the state a top priority, blanketing the airwaves with advertisements. Of the more than $110 million spent on advertising in seven battleground states since Biden dropped out in late July, roughly $42 million was in Pennsylvania, more than twice any other state, the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday, citing data from the tracking site AdImpact.</p>

<p>Democratic and Republican groups have already reserved $114 million in ad time in Pennsylvania from late August through the election, more than twice as much as the $55 million reserved in Arizona, the next highest total, according to AdImpact.</p>

<p>The Harris campaign said on Saturday it planned to spend at least $370 million on digital and television ads nationwide between the Labor Day holiday on Sept. 2 and Election Day.</p>

<p>The battleground states - seen as critical for winning the election - also include Arizona, North Carolina, Nevada and Georgia.</p>

<p>New polls published on Saturday by the New York Times found Harris leading Trump among likely voters in Arizona, 50% to 45%, and in North Carolina, 49% to 47%, and narrowing the former president's leads in Nevada, 47% to 49%, and in Georgia, 46% to 50%. A pollster from the Trump campaign said the poll results underestimated the Republican candidate's support.</p>

<p>Trump will give remarks on the economy at a campaign event in York, Pennsylvania, on Monday. His running mate, U.S. Senator JD Vance, will hold an event in Philadelphia that day as well.</p>

<p>Trump's trip to Wilkes-Barre in Luzerne County was aimed at solidifying support among the white, non-college-educated voters who lifted him to victory in 2016. The blue-collar county voted Democratic for decades before swinging heavily toward Trump in 2016, mirroring other similar regions around the country.</p>

<p>Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, will make multiple stops across Allegheny and Beaver counties on Sunday, the campaign said. The tour is the first time Harris, Walz and their spouses have campaigned together since their first rally as a presidential ticket in Philadelphia earlier this month.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Germany, the second largest contributor of aid to Ukraine, plans to halve its military aid to Kyiv in 2025, a parliamentary source told AFP Saturday.</p>

<p>Instead, the government of Olaf Scholz will bank on money generated from frozen Russian assets to continue supporting Kyiv, and is not planning "additional aid" to the 4 billion euros ($4.4 billion) set aside in next year's budget.</p>

<p>This year, aid from Berlin amounted to 8 billion euros.</p>

<p>To compensate, Germany is counting on "the creation, within the framework of the G7 and the European Union, of a financial instrument using frozen Russian assets, said a separate source from inside the ministry of finance.</p>

<p>German daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung said in its weekend edition that the move was part of an agreement between the chancellor, the Social Democratic party (SPD) and Finance Minister Christian Lindner.</p>

<p>Lindner is a member of junior coalition partner the Liberal party.</p>

<p>Ukraine's ambassador to Germany Oleksii Makeiev said in a posting on X, formerly Twitter, that "the security of Europe depends on Germany's political will to continue to play a frontline role in supporting Ukraine".</p>

<p>The 2025 budget has been the subject of fierce discussions between the government coalition of Liberals, the Greens and the Social Democrats.</p>

<p>Lindner has asked other ministries to make savings in order to respect a constitutional rule that aims to prevent the state from taking on too much debt.</p>

<p>However the budget is still subject to discussions before being adopted by the end of the year. The finance ministry said Saturday it was open to considering extra spending for Ukraine on a case-by-case basis.</p>

<p>Ukraine's allies have been working for several months on a mechanism to allow part of the $300 billion of Russian assets frozen worldwide to be used to support Kyiv in its war with Moscow.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

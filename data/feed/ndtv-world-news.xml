       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United States has returned to Iran more than 1,000 clay tablets dating from the Achaemenid-era, official media said, reporting the sixth such handover of its kind.</p>

<p>Iran's official IRNA news agency said Thursday evening that the tablets, 1,100 in all, were returned with President Masoud Pezeshkian who had attended the United Nations General Assembly in New York.</p>

<p>Found at the ruins of Persepolis, the capital of the Persian Achaemenid Empire which ruled from the 6th to 4th centuries BC in southern Iran, the repatriated tablets reflect how the ancient society was organised and its economy managed.</p>

<p>The tablets constitute records of "the rituals and the way of life of our ancestors", said Ali Darabi, vice-minister of cultural heritage, cited by IRNA.</p>

<p>The tablets were returned to Iran by the University of Chicago's Institute for the Study of Ancient Cultures, West Asia &amp; North Africa, formerly known as the Oriental Institute.</p>

<p>A large portion of the tablets were returned in three batches between 1948 and 2004 before the rest were blocked by legal action until 2018.</p>

<p>More than 3,500 tablets were repatriated in September, 2023.</p>

<p>"The American side undertook to return the rest," Darabi said, cited by Iran's ISNA news agency.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 30-year-old factory worker in Thailand collapsed and died a day after her manager allegedly refused her sick leave request. According to the <em>Bangkok Post</em>, the woman, identified only as May, was an employee at an electronics plant in the Samut Prakan province in Thailand. The 30-year-old had first taken leave with a medical certificate from September 5 to September 9, after she was diagnosed with an inflamed large intestine. She spent four days at the hospital while receiving treatment for her condition. &nbsp;</p>

<p>After being discharged, Ms May took two more days of sick leave as she was not feeling better, the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/general/2867201/worker-dies-after-boss-allegedly-refused-her-sick-leave" rel="noindex, nofollow">outlet </a>reported. On September 12, she asked her manager for another day of sick leave, saying her condition had deteriorated further. However, her manager refused her sick leave, saying that she had to come to work and submit another medical certificate since she had already taken many sick days off.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Worried about losing her job, the 30-year-old went to work on September 13 despite still feeling very ill. However, she collapsed after working for just 20 minutes, her friend claimed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ms May was rushed to the hospital and sent immediately for emergency surgery, per <em>Bangkok Post</em>. But unfortunately, she was pronounced dead from necrotising enterocolitis on the evening of the following day.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ms May's employer, Delta Electronics Thailand, announced her death on its Facebook page and offered condolences. "We are deeply saddened by the loss of our colleague. Our thoughts and heartfelt condolences go out to her family and loved ones during this difficult time," the company said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"At this moment, we are still in the process of establishing the facts surrounding her passing and have initiated a thorough investigation. Our goal is to create a better understanding of the situation while ensuring we provide the necessary support to her family. We remain fully committed to doing everything we can to help during this challenging period. We will share updates as more information becomes available. Thank you for your patience and understanding during this sensitive time," it added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Notably, the incident comes amid a nationwide debate over workplace pressure after an Ernst and Young worker allegedly died of "overwork". Anna Sebastian, who worked at EY's Pune office for around four months, died in July. Earlier this month, her mother Anita Augustine wrote to EY India Chairman Rajiv Memani and flagged the "glorification" of overwork at the consulting firm. Her father claimed that the 26-year-old raised concerns over work pressure with her seniors.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The trial of a man who drugged his wife to have her raped by dozens of strangers for almost a decade has ignited a quiet discussion around masculinity in France.</p>

<p>During court hearings, Dominique Pelicot, 71, has admitted to administering sedatives to his wife to rape her while unconscious and inviting strangers into their home to join in the abuse from 2011 to 2020.</p>

<p>The trial, which began in early September, has horrified people in France, particularly because Pelicot's 50 co-defendants include seemingly normal men with families and ordinary jobs.</p>

<p>His then wife, 71-year-old Gisele Pelicot, has become an overnight feminist icon by refusing to be ashamed and demanding the trial be open to the public to raise awareness about the use of drugs to commit sexual abuse.</p>

<p>Thousands of people, including some men, took to the streets in mid-September to support her and demand an end to "rape culture".</p>

<p>Several high-profile men have also publicly suggested it is in fact masculinity that is on trial and urged their peers to help stem the violence.</p>

<p>"Let's stop viewing women's bodies as objects at our disposal," read a text signed by more than 170 men and published in the left-leaning Liberation newspaper on Saturday.</p>

<p>"Let's stop thinking there exists a certain male nature that justifies our behaviour," it read.</p>

<p>"Let's stop perpetuating the boy's club and protecting our male peers."</p>

<p>French-Rwandan writer and rapper Gael Faye and French humourist Guillaume Meurice were among those to sign the so-called roadmap to "end masculine domination".</p>

<h3><strong>'Everyday men'</strong></h3>

<p>The petition's author -- therapist and activist Morgan N. Lucas -- said it was necessary to stop ignoring systemic violence, alluding to the hashtag #notallmen.</p>

<p>"The Pelicot case has proved that male violence is not about monsters but men -- everyday men," he wrote.</p>

<p>"All men, without exception, benefit from a system that dominates women. And since we are all the problem, we can all be part of the solution."</p>

<p>During a protest in the central city of Clermont-Ferrand on September 14, agricultural worker Stephane Boufferet said he hoped Gisele Pelicot would find justice.</p>

<p>"When I read the story, I was disgusted, even disgusted to be a man," the 26-year-old said.</p>

<p>Political journalist Karim Rissouli said a day earlier on Instagram that he felt "sick to the stomach as a man" after filming a programme about the trials.</p>

<p>French singer Renaud, 72, said last week he hoped the public nature of the trial would "finally force this patriarchal society, and us men, to take action over violence against women and children".</p>

<p>The co-defendants on trial in Avignon until December are aged 26 to 74.</p>

<p>Apart from Pelicot, they include 49 men accused of raping or attempting to rape his wife, and another who has admitted to sedating his own spouse so that he and Pelicot could sexually assault her.</p>

<p>The defendants include a fireman, a nurse and a journalist.</p>

<p>Many have said they believed they were taking part in the sexual fantasy of a couple.</p>

<p>But in hearings in recent days, several have reluctantly admitted that Gisele Pelicot had not given her consent.</p>

<h3><strong>'Men are not interested'</strong></h3>

<p>Ivan Jablonka, a social historian who has written about masculinity, said the trial was historic, including because of the sheer number of defendants.</p>

<p>"It's a reminder, if one were necessary, that rapes are committed by our neighbours, our colleagues, our relatives in our homes," he said.</p>

<p>The case has also called into question certain "patterns of masculinity", such as "moral collusion" between men.</p>

<p>But Jablonka was not overly optimistic.</p>

<p>"There is growing awareness but I think it is limited to a very small minority" of men, he said.</p>

<p>"In the street, in discussions, on social media -- everywhere really -- I still see a lot of indifference, contempt and silence. Complicit silence.</p>

<p>"Overall men are not interested."</p>

<p>He said there were still a "massive" number of gender-based crimes and much work remained to be done.</p>

<p>The author recalled touring with a 2019 book on how men could contribute to gender justice, whose English translation is entitled "A History of Masculinity".</p>

<p>"I'd say 90 percent of my audience were women," he said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel will continue to discuss ceasefire proposals for Lebanon in the days ahead, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Friday, as Washington warned that further escalation would only make it harder for civilians on both sides to return home.</p>

<p>Israel's foreign minister on Thursday rejected global calls for a ceasefire with the Iran-backed Hezbollah group and pressed ahead with airstrikes that have killed hundreds in Lebanon and heightened fears of a regional war.</p>

<p>An Israeli strike on Friday killed nine members of a family, including four children, in the Lebanese border town of Shebaa, mayor Mohammad Saab told Reuters. Israeli attacks have killed more than 600 people in Lebanon since Monday, the health ministry says.</p>

<p>Hezbollah said it had fired rockets into Israel on Friday at Kiryat Ata near the city of Haifa some 30 km (20 miles) from the border, and the city of Tiberias, declaring the attacks a response to Israel strikes on villages, cities and civilians.</p>

<p>Though Israeli air defences have shot down many of Hezbollah's rockets, limiting the damage they've done, the group's attacks have shut down normal life across much of northern Israel as more areas fall into its crosshairs.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said it had intercepted four unmanned aircraft that crossed from Lebanese territory into the maritime space off the coast of Rosh Hanikra at the Lebanese border.</p>

<p>The conflict between Israeli forces and the heavily armed Hezbollah is their worst in more than 18 years and part of the regional spillover of the Gaza war.</p>

<p>The United States and France proposed an immediate 21-day truce on Wednesday, and said negotiations continued, including on the sidelines of a United Nations meeting in New York.</p>

<p>Netanyahu said on Friday that Israeli teams had meetings to discuss the U.S. ceasefire proposals on Thursday and would continue discussions in the days ahead, adding that he appreciated the U.S. efforts.</p>

<p>"Our teams met (Sept. 26) to discuss the U.S. initiative and how we can advance the shared goal of returning people safely to their homes. We will continue those discussions in the coming days," he said in a statement.</p>

<p>On Thursday, after Netanyahu left for New York where he is attending the United Nations General Assembly, his office issued a statement saying the prime minister had ordered Israeli troops to continue fighting with full force in Lebanon.</p>

<p>His statement made no reference to the comments of Foreign Minister Israel Katz, who on Thursday rejected ceasefire proposals, or other Israeli politicians who have echoed that position, saying only that there had been "a lot of misreporting around the U.S.-led ceasefire initiative".</p>

<h3><strong>Blinken Stresses Importance Of Ceasefire</strong></h3>

<p>Israel says its campaign aims to secure the return home of tens of thousands of Israelis who have been forced to evacuate areas near the Lebanese border over the last year of hostilities with Hezbollah.</p>

<p>Hezbollah began firing at Israel on Oct. 8 as the Gaza war began, declaring solidarity with the Palestinians. Hezbollah has said it will only cease fire when Israel's Gaza offensive ends.</p>

<p>In Lebanon, more than 90,000 people have been reported as newly displaced this week, according to the U.N. International Organisation for Migration (IOM), adding to more than 111,000 already uprooted by the conflict.</p>

<p>U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told Israel on Thursday that further escalation to the conflict will only make it harder for civilians to return home on both sides of the border, the State Department said.</p>

<p>"The Secretary discussed the importance of reaching an agreement on the 21 day ceasefire across the Israel-Lebanon border," the State Department said in a statement referring to talks between Blinken and Israeli Minister for Strategic Affairs Ron Dermer.</p>

<p>"He underscored that further escalation of the conflict will only make that objective (of civilian return) more difficult."</p>

<p>The State Department added that Blinken also discussed efforts to reach a ceasefire in Gaza and steps that Israel needs to take to improve delivery of humanitarian assistance in the enclave where nearly the entire 2.3 million population is displaced and faces a hunger crisis.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Japan's next prime minister, Shigeru Ishiba, says he reads three books a day and would rather do that than mingle with the ruling party colleagues who picked him as their new leader today</p>

<p>The 67-year-old's successful leadership bid after four failed attempts puts the self-professed lone wolf at the helm of a Liberal Democratic Party that has ruled Japan for most of the past seven decades.</p>

<p>Ishiba takes over with the party in crisis, having seen its public support ebb away over the past two years with revelations of links to a church branded a cult by critics and a scandal over unrecorded donations.</p>

<p>A former defence minister who entered parliament in 1986 after a short banking career, Ishiba was sidelined by previous premiers including outgoing Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, becoming instead a dissenting voice in the party.</p>

<p>He has rebelled on policies including the increased use of nuclear energy and has criticised his party for not allowing married couples to use separate surnames.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>"I have undoubtedly hurt many people's feelings, caused unpleasant experiences and made many suffer. I sincerely apologise for all of my shortcomings," he told LDP lawmakers who gathered at party headquarters for the election, before his narrow triumph over hard-line nationalist Sanae Takaichi.</p>

<p>Launching his campaign at a Shinto shrine in rural Tottori prefecture, where his father was governor and where Ishiba began his political career at the height of Japan's fast growing bubble economy, he told supporters this was his "final battle".</p>

<p>Ishiba, who has also served as agriculture minister, promised to move some ministries and government agencies out of Tokyo to help revive Japan's moribund regions. He has also proposed establishing an agency to oversee the construction of emergency shelters across disaster-prone Japan.</p>

<h2><strong>FRICTION</strong></h2>

<p>Ishiba's outspoken views, including calls for Kishida to step down, have earned him enemies in the LDP.</p>

<p>That enmity, which also stems from a four-year defection to an opposition group in 1993, made it difficult for Ishiba to win the 20 nominations he needed from fellow lawmakers to qualify as a candidate in the election on Friday.</p>

<p>His lack of popularity among lawmakers means that Ishiba has had to rely on the support he has nurtured among rank-and-file members over his four decades in politics.</p>

<p>He has stayed in the public eye during his time away from government with media appearances, social media posts and on YouTube, where he muses on topics ranging from Japan's falling birthrate to ramen noodles.</p>

<p>He also pokes fun at himself, including his sometimes-awkward manner and hobbies including plastic models of ships and military aircraft, some of which he displays on the bookshelves that line his parliamentary office in Tokyo.</p>

<h3><strong>US DIPLOMACY</strong></h3>

<p>Seen as an LDP intellectual heavyweight and expert on national security policy, he advocates for a more assertive Japan that can reduce its reliance on longtime ally, the U.S., for its defence.</p>

<p>That position, analysts say, could complicate relations with Washington.</p>

<p>During the LDP leadership campaign, he called for Japan to lead the creation of an "Asian NATO", an idea quickly rejected by Washington as too hasty.</p>

<p>In Okinawa where most of the U.S. troops in Japan are concentrated, he said he would seek greater oversight of the bases they use. He also wants Washington to give Japan a say in how it would use nuclear weapons in Asia.</p>

<p>In an interview with Reuters, Ishiba also criticised the U.S. political backlash to Nippon Steel's bid for U.S. Steel, saying it unfairly cast Japan as a national security risk. Kishida has avoided making comments on the issue ahead of the U.S. presidential election.</p>

<h3><strong>POLICY SHIFTS</strong></h3>

<p>Ishiba has, however, softened some policy positions that have put him at odds with party colleagues, most notably saying he would keep some reactors operating in Japan, despite his past opposition to nuclear power and support for renewable energy sources.</p>

<p>A fiscal conservative who has promised to respect the independence of the Bank of Japan to set monetary policy, he has more recently said it is unclear whether conditions were right for a fresh hike in interest rates.</p>

<p>"Politicians don't need to be best friends, as long as their policies and political positions match," Ishiba said in a video posted on YouTube this week.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former defence minister Shigeru Ishiba will become Japan's prime minister next week after winning the conservative ruling party's leadership vote on Friday.</p>

<p>The 67-year-old train lover beat arch-nationalist Sanae Takaichi -- who would have been the country's first-ever woman leader -- 215 votes to 194 in a run-off.</p>

<p>After his victory was announced at the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) headquarters in Tokyo, Ishiba smiled and took off his glasses to wipe his teary eyes, and bowed repeatedly as his associates congratulated him.</p>

<p>"I will do my utmost to believe in the people, to speak the truth with courage and sincerity, and to make this country a safe and secure place where everyone can live with a smile on their face once again," he said in a short speech.</p>

<p>Ishiba had come close to the top job before, including in 2012 when he lost to nationalist Shinzo Abe, Japan's longest-serving leader who was later assassinated.</p>

<p>The LDP has governed almost uninterrupted for decades and holds a majority, meaning Ishiba will be elected premier by parliament on Tuesday.</p>

<p>The military model-maker with an affinity for 1970s pop idols says his experience tackling tough issues, such as agriculture reforms, makes him qualified for the job.</p>

<p><strong>Yen surges</strong></p>

<p>As prime minister, Ishiba will need to face down regional security threats, from an increasingly assertive China and its deepening ties with Russia to North Korea's banned missile tests.</p>

<p>His push to boost the military and call for the creation of an Asian NATO could rile Beijing, but he is careful with his words concerning China.</p>

<p>Following the result, China's foreign ministry spokesman said the country wants to improve ties with Japan, because "the long-term, sound and steady development of China-Japan relations serves the fundamental interests of the two peoples".</p>

<p>At home, Ishiba will be tasked with breathing life into the economy, as the central bank moves away from decades of monetary easing that has slashed the value of the yen.</p>

<p>The Japanese currency surged after Friday's result, firming to 142.94 against the dollar from 146.49 yen when the head-to-head between Ishiba and Takaichi was announced.</p>

<p>Ishiba supports the Bank of Japan's exit from its unorthodox ultra-loose policies and his win "will almost certainly be welcome news for policymakers" there, Capital Economics said.</p>

<p>He has also pledged to revitalise rural regions and proposes creating a government agency for disaster prevention.</p>

<p>In the first round of voting, a record nine candidates were in the running after the LDP's long-powerful factions disbanded this year over a funding scandal.</p>

<p>Takaichi, the economic security minister, is a vocal nationalist popular with the LDP's conservative wing. The 63-year-old was close to assassinated ex-premier Abe, whose supporters are still powerful.</p>

<p>In third place behind Ishiba and Takaichi was former environment minister Shinjiro Koizumi, a keen surfer whose father was prime minister in the 2000s.</p>

<h3><strong>'Courage in his convictions'</strong></h3>

<p>LDP leaders are in office for three years and can serve up to three straight terms. Unpopular Prime Minister Fumio Kishida did not run for re-election.</p>

<p>"I have a good impression of Ishiba, because he seems to have courage in his convictions," Junko Tominaga, a woman in her 50s, told AFP on the streets of Tokyo.</p>

<p>"I just don't want Japan to tilt further to the right under Ishiba in terms of defence."</p>

<p>Minoru Kitani, 46, said his "hopes for Ishiba aren't so high".</p>

<p>"But I agree with, and support, his belief that Japan needs to be protected better, made stronger and guarded against the threat of other countries," he said.</p>

<p>While "a woman prime minister would've been good," a win for Abe's mentee Takaichi would not "have done much to herald a fresh start for Japan".</p>

<p>The LDP has governed Japan almost uninterrupted for decades, with the main opposition parties rarely seen as viable alternatives.</p>

<p>During his term, Kishida has taken steps to double Japan's defence spending, opening the door for military exports as the LDP seeks to revise the pacifist post-war constitution.</p>

<p>He welcomed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to a G7 summit in Hiroshima and has strengthened Japan's often testy ties with its neighbour South Korea.</p>

<p>But his rule was also tarnished by scandals, voter anger over rising prices and sliding poll ratings.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div class="theconversation-article-body">
<p>While it's one thing to acknowledge the limits to our knowledge of the microbial soup we live in, more recent attention has focused on how we might systematically approach future pandemic risks.</p>

<p>Former US Secretary of Defense <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160406235718/http://archive.defense.gov/Transcripts/Transcript.aspx?TranscriptID=2636">Donald Rumsfeld</a> famously talked about “known knowns” (things we know we know), “known unknowns” (things we know we don't know), and “unknown unknowns” (the things we don't know we don't know).</p>

<p>Although this may have been controversial in its original context of weapons of mass destruction, it provides <a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/2024/what-is-disease-x">a way to think about</a> how we might approach future pandemic threats.</p>

<h3><strong>Influenza: a ‘known known'</strong></h3>

<p>Influenza is largely a known entity; we essentially have a minor pandemic every winter with small changes in the virus each year. But more major changes can also occur, resulting in spread through populations with little pre-existing immunity. We saw this most recently in 2009 with the <a href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/cvi.05072-11">swine flu pandemic</a>.</p>

<p>However, there's a lot we don't understand about what drives influenza mutations, how these interact with population-level immunity, and how best to make predictions about transmission, severity and impact each year.</p>

<p>The current H5N1 subtype of avian influenza (“bird flu”) <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/influenza-h5n1">has spread</a> widely around the world. It has led to the deaths of <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/data-map-commercial.html">many millions</a> of birds and spread to several mammalian species <a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections/livestock">including cows</a> in the United States and <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-41182-0">marine mammals</a> in South America.</p>

<p>Human cases <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/influenza-h5n1">have been reported</a> in people who have had close contact with infected animals, but fortunately there's currently no sustained spread between people.</p>

<p>While detecting influenza in animals is a huge task in a large country such as Australia, there are <a href="https://www.agriculture.gov.au/biosecurity-trade/pests-diseases-weeds/animal/avian-influenza">systems in place</a> to detect and respond to bird flu in wildlife and production animals.</p>

<p>It's inevitable there will be more influenza pandemics in the future. But it isn't always the one we are worried about.</p>

<p>Attention has been focused on avian influenza since 1997 when an outbreak in birds in <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14575073/">Hong Kong</a> caused severe disease in humans. However the subsequent <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4957980/">pandemic in 2009</a> originated in pigs in central Mexico.</p>

<h3><strong>Coronaviruses: an ‘unknown known'</strong></h3>

<p>Although Rumsfeld didn't talk about “unknown knowns”, coronaviruses would be appropriate for this category. We knew more about coronaviruses than most people might have thought before the COVID pandemic. &nbsp;</p>

<p>We'd had experience with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) causing large outbreaks. Both are caused by viruses <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2012-7">closely related</a> to SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID. While these might have faded from public consciousness before COVID, coronaviruses were listed in the 2015 <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/events/detail/2015/12/08/default-calendar/december-2015---first-list-of-top-emerging-diseases-likely-to-cause-major-epidemics">WHO list</a> of diseases with pandemic potential.</p>

<p>Previous research into the earlier coronaviruses proved vital in allowing COVID-19 vaccines to be developed rapidly. For example, the Oxford group's initial work on <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X17306564?via%3Dihub">a MERS vaccine</a> was key to the development of AstraZeneca's COVID-19 vaccine.</p>

<p>Similarly, previous research into the structure of the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5584442/">spike protein</a> – a protein on the surface of coronaviruses that allows it to attach to our cells – was helpful in developing mRNA vaccines for COVID.</p>

<p>It would seem likely there will be further coronavirus pandemics in the future. And even if they don't occur at the scale of COVID, the impacts can be significant. For example, when MERS spread to South Korea in 2015, it only caused 186 cases over two months, but the cost of controlling it was <a href="https://wellcome.org/news/cost-of-not-preparing-for-infectious-diseases">estimated at US$8 billion</a> (A$11.6 billion).</p>

<h3><strong>The 25 viral families: an approach to ‘known unknowns'</strong></h3>

<p>Attention has now turned to the known unknowns. There are about 120 viruses from <a href="https://www.jci.org/articles/view/139601">25 families</a> that are known to cause human disease. Members of each viral family share common properties and our immune systems respond to them in similar ways.</p>

<p>An example is the <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/article/S0140-6736(08)60238-X/fulltext">flavivirus family</a>, of which the best-known members are yellow fever virus and dengue fever virus. This <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-020-0714-0">family also includes</a> several other important viruses, such as Zika virus (which can cause <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsr1604338">birth defects</a> when pregnant women are infected) and West Nile virus (which causes <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1125772/">encephalitis</a>, or inflammation of the brain).</p>

<p>The WHO's <a href="https://www.who.int/teams/blueprint/who-r-and-d-blueprint-for-epidemics">blueprint for epidemics</a> aims to consider threats from different classes of viruses and bacteria. It looks at individual pathogens as examples from each category to expand our understanding systematically.</p>

<p>The US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases has taken this a step further, preparing vaccines and therapies for a list of <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10582320/">prototype pathogens</a> from key virus families. The goal is to be able to adapt this knowledge to new vaccines and treatments if a pandemic were to arise from a closely related virus.</p>

<h3><strong>Pathogen X, the ‘unknown unknown'</strong></h3>

<p>There are also the unknown unknowns, or “<a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/2024/what-is-disease-x">disease X</a>” – an unknown pathogen with the potential to trigger a severe global epidemic. To prepare for this, we need to adopt new forms of surveillance specifically looking at where new pathogens could emerge.</p>

<p>In recent years, there's been an increasing recognition that we need to take a broader view of health beyond only thinking about human health, but also animals and the environment. This concept is known as “<a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)31486-0/fulltext">One Health</a>” and considers issues such as climate change, intensive agricultural practices, trade in exotic animals, increased human encroachment into wildlife habitats, changing international travel, and urbanisation.</p>

<p>This <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34231315/">has implications</a> not only for where to look for new infectious diseases but also for how we can reduce the risk of “spillover” from animals to humans. This might include <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41684-021-00725-y">targeted testing</a> of animals and people who work closely with animals. Currently, testing is mainly directed towards known viruses, but <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-40247-4">new technologies</a> can look for as yet unknown viruses in patients with symptoms consistent with new infections.</p>

<p>We live in a vast world of potential microbiological threats. While influenza and coronaviruses have a track record of causing past pandemics, a longer list of new pathogens could still cause outbreaks with significant consequences.</p>

<p>Continued surveillance for new pathogens, improving our understanding of important virus families, and developing policies to reduce the risk of spillover will all be important for reducing the risk of future pandemics.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Vladimir Putin's proposed revision of Russian nuclear policy signals a worrying readiness to use the ultimate weapon against Ukraine and even NATO members, but it remains far from certain the threat will be translated into action, analysts say.</p>

<p>The proposed broadening of Russia's nuclear rules comes as Moscow's invasion of Ukraine stretches into its third year and Kyiv seeks permission from Western allies to use long-range weapons to strike targets deep inside Russia.</p>

<p>With the ramped-up rhetoric Putin is looking to dissuade Western countries from broadening support for Kyiv.</p>

<p>But with repeated threats, he is also putting himself under pressure to act on the use of nuclear weapons, not only against Ukraine but also its NATO backers.</p>

<p>Maxim Starchak, a fellow at the Centre for International and Defence Policy at Queen's University in Canada, said that with the revision of the doctrine, Putin wanted to lower the threshold for use of nuclear weapons.</p>

<p>"Putin counts on the introduction of an additional -- nuclear -- factor in the Ukraine war. He believes and hopes that this will work," Starchak said.</p>

<p>A senior European military official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Putin had a limited range of options two and a half years into the war.</p>

<p>When Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, "Putin went all-in. He therefore has little capacity for escalation," the official said.</p>

<p>He outlined three options at Putin's disposal: the use of nuclear rhetoric, the use of nuclear weapons, and hybrid warfare against the West.</p>

<h2><strong>WESTERN NUCLEAR RESPONSE</strong></h2>

<p>Since the invasion Putin has repeatedly threatened to use nuclear weapons, which the West has dismissed as sabre rattling.</p>

<p>But on Wednesday he went further, announcing changes to the country's nuclear doctrine during a televised meeting of the Kremlin's Security Council.</p>

<p>The updated doctrine would allow the use of nuclear weapons against non-nuclear states when they are supported by nuclear powers -- a clear reference to Ukraine and its Western backers.</p>

<p>The new rules would also allow Russia to unleash a nuclear response in the event of a "massive" air attack, he said.</p>

<p>For Pavel Luzin, a visiting scholar at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, Putin's threats still rang hollow.</p>

<p>"Russia is frantically looking for ways to make the world afraid of Russian nuclear weapons again," he said.</p>

<p>Hans Kristensen, director of the Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists, said: "While the Ukrainian retaliation strikes into Russia are causing serious damage, a Russian nuclear response could lead to far greater damage if it triggered a Western nuclear response."</p>

<p>The European Union on Thursday denounced Putin's latest move as "reckless and irresponsible", and US Secretary of State Antony Blinken called the Russian leader "totally irresponsible".</p>

<h3><strong>QUESTIONS FROM PEOPLE</strong></h3>

<p>In Moscow, Alexander Khramchikhin, a Russian military analyst, said he did not see "any fundamental changes" to the doctrine, and its wording remains intentionally vague.</p>

<p>What mattered, he said, was the message the Kremlin was sending after Ukraine repeatedly crossed Moscow's "red lines", with its cross-border offensive in the western region of Kursk and the massive use of drones against targets deep inside Russia.</p>

<p>He noted that Putin was coming under increasing pressure from the military, politicians and public opinion at home to use nuclear weapons to win the Ukraine war.</p>

<p>"I am now constantly hearing questions from ordinary people who are asking why we are still not using nuclear weapons," Khramchikhin said.</p>

<p>Since the start of the war, Russian propaganda has gone into overdrive, threatening nuclear retaliation even against Western capitals.</p>

<p>Sergei Karaganov, a high-profile political scientist known for his hawkish views, has urged Putin to use limited nuclear strikes to "save" human civilisation.</p>

<p>Thirty-four percent of Russians consider the use of nuclear weapons against Ukraine to be justified, according to a poll by the Levada Centre released in July.</p>

<p>"Well-articulated direct military threats against NATO are the most effective way to communicate," said Vasily Kashin, a Russia-based political scientist. "But at the same time we must be ready to act on these threats."</p>

<p>"We may see limited strikes against facilities in Eastern Europe," Kashin said. "It could lead to a nuclear escalation. A protracted conflict is a dangerous situation."<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As Spanish microbiologist Pilar Bosch was casting around for a subject to investigate for her PhD in 2008, she stumbled across a paper suggesting that bacteria, her field, could be used in art restoration, her mother's own area of expertise.</p>

<p>At that same moment, her mother - Pilar Roig - was struggling to restore 18th-century paintings by Antonio Palomino in one of the oldest churches in Spain's third city, Valencia.</p>

<p>She was finding it particularly difficult to remove the glue that had been used to pull the frescoes from the walls of Santos Juanes church during restoration work in the 1960s.</p>

<p>"My mother had a very difficult problem to solve and I found a paper about bacteria used to clean frescoes in Italy," Bosch, 42, said.</p>

<p>She did her PhD on that project. And more than a decade later, daughter and mother have joined forces on a 4-million-euro ($4.46-million) project, funded by local foundations, to use some of the techniques to restore the artworks in Valencia.</p>

<p>The microbiologist trains bacteria by feeding them samples of the glue which was made from animal collagen. The bacteria then naturally produce enzymes to degrade the glue.</p>

<p>The family team then mixes the bacteria with a natural algae-based gel and spread it on the paintings - which were taken from the walls in the 1960s, then nailed back on, still covered in glue.</p>

<p>After three hours, the gel is removed, revealing glue-free paintings.</p>

<p>"In the past, we used to work in a horrible manual way, with warm water and sponges that took hours and damaged the painting," said Roig, now 75, whose father and grandfather along with other relatives also worked in art conservation.</p>

<p>Her microbiologist daughter has now joined in. "It certainly runs in the family," Bosch said, as both stood in lab coats, supervising the restoration.</p>

<p>Bosch has also applied her use of bacteria to restoration projects in Pisa and Monte Cassino in Italy and in Santiago de Compostela in northern Spain. She is now training up cohorts of a different kind of bacteria to clear walls of spray-painted graffiti.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A group of fishermen in Canada caught what appeared to be a giant crocodile-like fish slowly moving under the calm waters.&nbsp;As their hook jerked unexpectedly, the fishermen peered into the water, encountering a sight that was both horrifying and awe-inspiring. The gigantic fish, eerily resembling a crocodile in shape, moved slowly; its unusual markings mesmerising onlookers. Onboard, the fishermen stood in stunned silence, frozen by the sheer size and bizarre appearance of the creature.</p>

<p>Sturgeon fish are ancient creatures that have been around for over 200 million years. They are mostly found in rivers, lakes&nbsp;and coastal waters in the Northern Hemisphere. Sturgeons are easily recognised by their long, streamlined bodies and bony plates instead of scales. Some can grow up to 6 meters long and weigh over 680 kgs. These fish primarily feed on small fish, crustaceans&nbsp;and invertebrates by using their sensitive barbels to find food at the bottom of the water. They migrate between freshwater and saltwater to spawn and can live for more than 100 years.</p>

<p>Last month, a 12.25-foot male oarfish, often dubbed a "doomsday fish," was <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/science/two-days-after-doomsday-fish-appears-in-california-earthquake-hits-los-angeles-6409382">discovered off the coast of California</a>. Paddle-boarders found the rare deep-sea fish, which is believed to have the ability to predict natural disasters. The fish was later taken to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) for examination, where scientists performed a necropsy to determine the cause of death, which remains unclear.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former US first lady Melania Trump recalled learning that her husband had been bloodied by a would-be assassin's bullet, describing his near-miss as "a miracle" in a rare interview aired Thursday.</p>

<p>The wife of former president Donald Trump told Fox News she was in New York in July when live images of the attack at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania played out on television.</p>

<p>"I ran to the TV, and I rewind it. And I watched it. I was only a few minutes behind... But when I saw it... nobody really knew yet because when you see him on the floor and you don't know, you don't know what really happened," she said.</p>

<p>Trump's bid for a White House return was upended when a 20-year-old gunman opened fire at him from a nearby rooftop at the event in Pennsylvania before the would-be assassin was shot dead by a sniper.</p>

<p>Trump's ear was grazed but he suffered no serious injury.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Melania Trump praised her husband's Secret Service detail -- calling the agents "fantastic" despite criticism over the stunning security failure.</p>

<p>She also briefly recalled her reaction to the suspected second attempt on the 78-year-old Republican's life at the Trump International Golf Course in West Palm Beach, Florida on September 15.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I think both of the events, they were really miracles. If you really think about it, July 13 was a miracle," she said.</p>

<h3><strong>&nbsp;'Invasion of privacy'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>The reclusive, media-shy former first lady was giving her first television interview in two years to promote her memoir, out on October 8, less than a month before the election that could put her husband back in power.</p>

<p>But while politician's spouses often take an active role in campaigning, Melania has largely snubbed her husband's rallies.</p>

<p>The Slovenian-born former model, 54, was also absent from his court hearings in New York, where he was convicted of 34 fraud felonies as part of a scandal involving hush money payments to a porn star.</p>

<p>She was asked about her husband's various criminal cases, and she criticized an FBI search at the couple's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida in 2022.</p>

<p>"It made me angry, yes. Invasion of privacy. And the way it was done... I was really surprised," she said after the bureau entered the property to recover classified documents allegedly stored unlawfully.</p>

<p>She also questioned the first assassination attempt against her husband because she felt it was being brushed under the carpet by the media.</p>

<h3><strong>'Tacky'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>"I had a lot of questions. What's going on? This is not normal. And is it really shocking that all this outrageous violence goes against my husband?" she said.</p>

<p>"Especially (when) we hear the leaders from the opposition party and mainstream media branding him as a threat to democracy, calling him vile names... This needs to stop. The country needs to unite."</p>

<p>The upcoming 256-page memoir is entitled simply "Melania," and a signed version accompanied by photographs sells for $250.</p>

<p>The ex-first lady and other members of the Trump clan have been criticized over the sheer volume of expensive merchandise they have on sale leveraging the tycoon's political career.</p>

<p>This week the ex-president added a series of $100,000 watches to a trove of merchandise he has on sale, including $100 silver coins made with $ 30 worth of silver, NFT trading cards, $60 Bibles and $400 sneakers.</p>

<p>Melania herself was mocked recently over a $600 gold "Vote Freedom" necklace she was selling, branded as "tacky" by daytime TV host and political commentator Ana Navarro.</p>

<p>"Basically, (the) only time Melania shows her face is to extract money from poor suckers," Navarro said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US and its allies shared a brief moment of optimism on Wednesday as they unveiled a three-week ceasefire proposal to halt the violence between Israel and Hezbollah.</p>

<p>It didn't last long.</p>

<p>Hours after introducing the proposal - amid positive signals from Israel's ambassador to the United Nations - the US came crashing up against opposition from a leader who has repeatedly dashed US hopes to ease the turmoil in the Middle East: Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his government.</p>

<p>"There will be no ceasefire," Foreign Minister Israel Katz wrote on X. Soon after, Netanyahu landed in New York and said Israel would keep up its fight against Hezbollah. While in flight, his office released a photo that purported to show him ordering a strike on a Hezbollah commander.</p>

<p>The symbolism of that image could not have been any more potent. Yet despite the rejections, White House spokesman John Kirby insisted that there were still "active discussions" with the Israelis about the ceasefire.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"It's not clear to us that from a practical perspective, that there isn't cause for us to continue to have these conversations with the Israelis," Kirby said.</p>

<p>The contradictory messaging - the US insisting Israel is considering its proposal, and Israel insisting it's not - further perpetuated a trend that's come to define the conflict and raised fresh questions about the US strategy to try to end it.</p>

<p>Israel's rejection bore strong echoes of a dialog that revolved around the bid for a ceasefire to halt the fighting between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip nearly a year after the militant group's Oct. 7 attack.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Repeatedly, the US has said Israel was onboard with its plan and an accord was close, only for Netanyahu and his government to say they don't see a ceasefire coming anytime soon.</p>

<p>Experts, analysts and government officials argue that for whatever the flaws of the strategy, the Biden administration has no choice but to continue. They suggested that the three-week ceasefire plan for Lebanon, with its dozen signatories along with the EU, may have been meant as a signal to Israel.</p>

<p>"I see this as critical US leadership maximally leveraging diplomatic alliances to sharpen Israeli understanding and appreciation of the costs of proceeding unilaterally," said Mara Rudman, who worked on Middle East issues during the Clinton and Obama administrations. "It will be heard and perhaps needs to sink in."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Before unveiling the ceasefire, the US, France and others marshaled a broad coalition to try and push the process forward. But now both US and French officials appear to be effectively ignoring Netanyahu's rejection in the hope that he will come around.</p>

<p>Speaking in Ottawa on Thursday, French President Emmanuel Macron said Netanyahu would be making a mistake by rejecting the Lebanon plan because it would make him responsible for "an escalation far beyond that which no one would be able to control."</p>

<p>That doesn't account for the pressure Netanyahu is coming under at home. Tens of thousands of Israelis have been displaced from areas near the Lebanese border and are clamoring to return. But even Israel appeared to acknowledge it had overstepped. Later Thursday, Netanyahu's office expressed appreciation for the Biden administration's efforts and "indispensable" role.</p>

<p>The statement acknowledged that the US was seeking to promote a ceasefire, but stopped short of endorsing this arrangement.</p>

<p>Two diplomats familiar with the Biden administration approach said the impression other nations get is that the US has been repeatedly embarrassed by Israel. The diplomats, who asked not to be identified discussing private assessments, said the US sacrificed its own standing when an ally such as Israel so blatantly flouts its wishes.</p>

<p>The impatience with Biden's approach may be growing. On Thursday, Senator Tim Kaine, a Virginia Democrat, said he would vote to oppose offensive weapons to Israel. He called them "an accelerant to ongoing hostilities."&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Biden administration has had to walk a fine line between likely Democratic voters with sympathies on either side of the conflict, particularly given the razor-thin margins in swing states expected to decide the presidential election.</p>

<p>The US seems to believe that "merely expressing the expectation that a deal is imminent or within reach - that this will put pressure on Netanyahu," said Khaled Elgindy, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute. "It's like they're trying to manifest a ceasefire into being without actually applying real pressure or using any of the vast leverage at their disposal."</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Oscar-winning actress Jennifer Lawrence has officially endorsed Kamala Harris for the 2024 US presidential election, citing the urgent need to safeguard abortion rights as a key reason for her decision. The 34-year-old star emphasised the critical nature of this issue, saying, "Abortion is literally on the ballot."</p>

<p>In an interview with PEOPLE magazine, Lawrence said she believed Harris would "do whatever she can to protect reproductive rights."</p>

<p>As a staunch advocate for women's rights, Lawrence elaborated on her support for Harris, saying, "I'm voting for Kamala Harris because I think she's an amazing candidate and I know that she will do whatever she can to protect reproductive rights."</p>

<p>She further encouraged others to join her in this endeavour, highlighting the importance of preventing any candidate, who would support an abortion ban, from entering the White House. "That's the most important thing, is to not let somebody into the White House who is going to ban abortion," PEOPLE quoted her as saying.</p>

<p>In addition to her endorsement, Lawrence is actively involved in producing two documentary films that reflect her political values. The projects include Bread and Roses -- about the lives of three women under Taliban rule in Afghanistan -- and Zurawski v Texas, which focuses on abortion care advocates who sued the state of Texas in 2023.</p>

<p>Acknowledging her unconventional educational background, Lawrence told PEOPLE, "As online trolls like to point out every time I get involved in politics, I didn't go to school, I dropped out of middle school, so I don't have a classic education. So storytelling is where I get most of my education."</p>

<p>Lawrence joins a growing list of prominent celebrities endorsing Harris in her bid for the presidency. George Clooney, Taylor Swift and Billie Eilish have already thrown their weight behind the Democratic candidate. The US presidential election, set to take place on November 5, will see Harris face off against Republican candidate Donald Trump.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[China's military was on "high alert" Thursday and Beijing said it had lodged a complaint with Tokyo after a Japanese warship sailed through the Taiwan Strait for the first time.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>China's military was on "high alert" Thursday and Beijing said it had lodged a complaint with Tokyo after a Japanese warship sailed through the Taiwan Strait for the first time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Japan's top government spokesman Yoshimasa Hayashi declined to comment on the reports at a regular briefing because they concerned military operations.</p>

<p>But Beijing confirmed its military had responded to "the activities of a Japanese Self-Defence Force ship entering the Taiwan Strait".</p>

<p>"China is highly vigilant about the political intentions of Japan's actions and has lodged stern representations with Japan," foreign ministry spokesman Lin Jian said.</p>

<p>The United States and its allies are increasingly crossing through the 180-kilometre (112-mile) Taiwan Strait to reinforce its status as an international waterway, angering China.</p>

<p>The Sazanami destroyer made the unprecedented passage on Wednesday, several Japanese media outlets said.</p>

<p>Military vessels from New Zealand and Australia also sailed through the fiercely contested waterway on the same day, Wellington's defence ministry said on Thursday.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A defence official told AFP that one of its ships made its first passage through the Taiwan Strait in seven years, alongside an Australian guided missile destroyer to assert the "right of freedom of navigation".</p>

<p>The official added the mission was not conducted with Japan. Japanese media said the three nations planned to conduct military drills in the contested South China Sea.</p>

<p>China's defence ministry also confirmed Thursday that vessels from the three countries "had a transit operation through the Taiwan Strait".</p>

<p>The Chinese military "stayed on high alert and monitored these passages", spokesman Zhang Xiaogang said.</p>

<p>"These operations will undermine China's sovereignty and security," he said.</p>

<p>"The (Chinese military) will remain on high alert and take all necessary measures to counter these threats and provocations," he added.</p>

<p><strong>'Threaten' China&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>In response to the "foreign warships transiting the Taiwan Strait", Beijing on Thursday said it "consistently handles such matters in accordance with laws and regulations".</p>

<p>The foreign ministry said it remained "highly vigilant against any actions that may threaten China's sovereignty and security".</p>

<p>Last week, China's Liaoning aircraft carrier sailed between two Japanese islands near Taiwan for the first time, accompanied by two destroyers.</p>

<p>The ships entered Japan's contiguous zone -- an area up to 24 nautical miles from the country's coast -- Tokyo said, calling the incident "totally unacceptable". China said it had complied with international law.</p>

<p>It followed the first confirmed incursion into Japanese airspace by a Chinese surveillance aircraft in August.</p>

<p>The Yomiuri Shimbun daily cited unnamed government sources as saying Prime Minister Fumio Kishida had ordered Wednesday's Taiwan Strait journey out of concern that doing nothing following China's intrusions could encourage Beijing to take more assertive actions.</p>

<p><strong>'Serious concern'</strong></p>

<p>Beijing, which says democratic Taiwan is part of its territory, claims jurisdiction over the body of water that separates the island from China.</p>

<p>But the United States and many other countries argue their voyages through the strait are routine, citing freedom of navigation.</p>

<p>China this month accused Berlin of heightening security risks in the Taiwan Strait, a day after two German navy ships sailed through the waters.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, China test-launched an intercontinental ballistic missile into the Pacific Ocean in its first such exercise in decades.</p>

<p>Japan said it had not been given advance notice of the test, with Hayashi expressing "serious concern" about China's military build-up in comments he reiterated on Thursday.</p>

<p>"China's military intrusion into our territorial airspace and other incidents have been happening one after another in a short period of time," Hayashi said.</p>

<p>Japan will do its "utmost in patrolling and monitoring" the situation, he added.</p>

<p>Taiwan's defence ministry also said Thursday that 43 Chinese military aircraft and eight naval vessels were detected around the island within a 24-hour period.</p>

<p>Beijing has said it will never renounce the use of force to bring Taiwan under its control, with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in recent years upping the rhetoric of "unification" being "inevitable".</p>

<p>Bec Strating, professor of international relations at La Trobe University, said Japan's reported Taiwan Strait transit "is part of a broader pattern of greater naval presence by countries in and beyond Asia that are concerned about China's maritime assertions".</p>

<p>"Japan in particular has been dealing with China's 'grey zone' tactics in the East China Sea," including an increasing number of coast guard vessels sailing close to disputed islands, she told AFP.</p>

<p>Grey-zone tactics are actions that serve to exhaust a country's armed forces, military experts say.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A man was put to death by lethal injection Thursday in the US state of Oklahoma, officials said, while Alabama was scheduled to carry out an execution with nitrogen gas, the second such execution in the country.</p>

<p>If the Alabama death sentence is carried out, it will bring the total number of executions this year in the United States to 18, including five in the past week.</p>

<p>Emmanuel Littlejohn, 52, was executed by lethal injection in Oklahoma for the murder of 31-year-old Kenneth Meers during a convenience store robbery in 1992.</p>

<p>While admitting he was present at the scene, he has always denied being the one who shot Meers.</p>

<p>Both he and his accomplice Glenn Bethany blamed each other for the killing.</p>

<p>The two men were convicted of murder, but Bethany received life imprisonment, whereas Littlejohn was sentenced to death.</p>

<p>In August, the State Board of Pardons recommended a commutation of Littlejohn's sentence, despite opposition from some of the victim's family.</p>

<p>Speaking on Wednesday to NPR, Littlejohn exhorted Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt to intervene.</p>

<p>"Governor, don't kill me for the heck of it," Littlejohn said.</p>

<p>Stitt, a Republican who had only exercised his clemency power once, ultimately denied the request.</p>

<p>Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond said Thursday that "justice has been served for the murder of Kenny Meers."</p>

<h3><strong>Nitrogen gas controversy&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Meanwhile, in Alabama, Alan Miller is scheduled to be put to death over a 1999 workplace shooting spree that killed three colleagues, Lee Holdbrooks, Scott Yancy and Terry Lee Jarvis.</p>

<p>Miller, 59, is to be executed at Atmore penitentiary by pumping nitrogen gas into a facemask, causing him to suffocate.</p>

<p>The method was controversially used by Alabama for the first time in January, despite being compared by the UN to a form of torture.</p>

<p>During that execution, 58-year-old Kenneth Smith reportedly thrashed about for several minutes.</p>

<p>State officials later attributed the convulsions to Smith attempting to hold his breath.</p>

<p>The White House, under Democratic President Joe Biden, said it was "deeply troubled" by Alabama's use of nitrogen in January.</p>

<p>It also drew rebukes from civil liberties groups, the European Union and the UN human rights office.</p>

<p>Alabama Governor Kay Ivey, a Republican, has announced in advance that she would not exercise her clemency power for Miller.</p>

<p>A previous attempt to execute Miller by lethal injection in September 2022 was called off at the last minute, due to difficulties inserting the intravenous tube and administering the lethal chemicals in the allotted time.</p>

<p>The death penalty has been abolished in 23 of the 50 US states. Six others (Arizona, California, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania and Tennessee) observe a moratorium on executions by decision of the governor.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>China's newest nuclear-powered attack submarine sank earlier this year, a senior US defence official said on Thursday, a potential embarrassment for Beijing as it seeks to expand its military capabilities.</p>

<p>China already has the largest navy in the world, with over 370 ships, and it has embarked on production of a new generation of nuclear-armed submarines.</p>

<p>A senior US defence official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said China's new first-in-class nuclear-powered attack submarine sank alongside a pier sometime between May and June.</p>

<p>A Chinese embassy spokesperson in Washington said they had no information to provide.</p>

<p>"We are not familiar with the situation you mentioned and currently have no information to provide," the Chinese official said.</p>

<p>The official said it was not clear what caused it to sink or whether it had nuclear fuel on board at the time.</p>

<p>"In addition to the obvious questions about training standards and equipment quality, the incident raises deeper questions about the PLA's internal accountability and oversight of China's defence industry - which has long been plagued by corruption," the official said, using an acronym for the People's Liberation Army.</p>

<p>"It's not surprising that the PLA Navy would try to conceal" the sinking, the official added.</p>

<p>Speaking in Taipei on Friday, Taiwan Defence Minister Wellington Koo said authorities "have a grasp of the situation through multiple intelligence and surveillance methods", but did not elaborate.</p>

<p>Taiwan, which China views as its own territory, keeps a close watch on the latter's military activities. In June, pictures appeared online of a Chinese nuclear submarine surfacing in the Taiwan Strait near Taiwan fishermen.</p>

<p>The Chinese submarine news was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.</p>

<p>A series of satellite images from Planet Labs from June appear to show cranes at the Wuchang shipyard, where the submarine would have been docked.</p>

<p>As of 2022, China had six nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines, six nuclear-powered attack submarines and 48 diesel-powered attack submarines, according to a Pentagon report on China's military.

       <description><![CDATA[These cells can transform into endothelial cells and macrophages, aiding in blood vessel growth and tissue repair, particularly when triggered by injury or poor blood flow.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today, life exists in the form of cells, which are pockets that contain DNA, RNA, proteins, and other substances. However, when life first appeared over four billion years ago, cells were simpler. Researchers in Australia discovered a completely new form of cell that fills a significant gap in our understanding of how the mammal body recovers.</p>

<p>For almost a century, scientists hypothesised that such a cell existed-and now, an adult version has been discovered, hidden in the aorta of adult mice.</p>

<p>The finding was nine years in the making. The cells have been called <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-51637-7">'EndoMac progenitors',</a> and the researchers are now looking for similar players in the human body.</p>

<p>"The EndoMac progenitor cells possess the unique ability to transform into two specific cell types of cells: endothelial cells that form blood vessels and macrophages that are immune cells responsible for tissue repair and defence," <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scimex.org/newsfeed/world-first-discovery-of-new-cell-type">said Dr Sanuri Liyange</a>, a researcher at the South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute and the University of Adelaide.</p>

<p>"These cells have an important job: to help grow blood vessels when the body calls for it."</p>

<p>"They are activated by injury or poor blood flow, at which point they rapidly expand to aid in healing," Dr Liyanage said.</p>

<p>As per a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scimex.org/newsfeed/world-first-discovery-of-new-cell-type"><em>release,</em></a> cells with similar functions have been theorised to exist for more than a century; however, until now, they had never been found. They were discovered in the outer layer of aortas in adult mice.</p>

<p>This discovery, led by SAHMRI's Professor Peter Psaltis, was nine years in the making, with the findings published in Nature Communications.</p>

<p>Ongoing research suggests the EndoMac progenitors could be used to boost healing in conditions like diabetes, where the body struggles to repair itself properly. Crucially, these cells don't express typical "self" markers, meaning they could be ideal candidates for stem cell transplantation as they're much less likely to be attacked by the recipient's immune system.</p>

<p>Dr Liyange and colleagues have isolated the cells from mice, grown them, and observed them forming colonies. These colonies have been tested in diabetic mouse models, showing remarkable improvements in wounds that normally wouldn't heal.</p>

<p>"When we transplanted these progenitors into diabetic wounds, we saw a dramatic improvement in healing within days, she said.</p>

<p>"In theory, this could become a game-changer for patients suffering from chronic wounds."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Olivia Nuzzi recently admitted to her editors that she was engaged in a relationship with former US presidential candidate Robert F Kennedy Jr.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former US presidential candidate Robert F Kennedy Jr allegedly grabbed the hand of New York magazine reporter Olivia Nuzzi during an interview last year, according to a report in <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/olivia-nuzzi-rfk-jr-fallout" rel="nofollow,noindex">Vanity Fair</a>. The incident, described as “creepy” by a fellow journalist, reportedly took place while Kennedy, 70, and Nuzzi, 31, were on a hike during an interview for a November 2023 profile in New York Magazine.</p>

<p>Multiple sources also told Vanity Fair that Kennedy initiated the hand-grab before the two allegedly engaged in a sexting exchange. Nuzzi reportedly shared details of the encounter with a colleague who also experienced a similar interaction with Kennedy.<br />
<br />
Nuzzi has declined to comment on the matter, and the Kennedy scion has yet to react. However, the incident raises doubts about Kennedy's previous claims that Nuzzi was the aggressor in their alleged online romance. Kennedy suggested that Nuzzi “bombarded” him with explicit photos over several months and was reportedly considering legal action against her.<br />
<br />
A source close to Kennedy's camp told the New York Post that Nuzzi became “obsessed” with Kennedy Jr after interviewing him in California and pursued him persistently via text.<br />
<br />
According to Jessica Reed Kraus, a mutual acquaintance, Kennedy attempted to block Nuzzi's number multiple times but would occasionally unblock her due to what Nuzzi described as “urgent discussions about an imminent hit piece.”<br />
<br />
The pair allegedly began communicating after the publication of Nuzzi's profile on Kennedy in New York Magazine. The magazine has since placed Nuzzi on leave and issued an apology after becoming aware of their relationship.<br />
<br />
Despite Nuzzi's insistence that “the relationship was never physical,” Kennedy's team maintains they only met once, during the interview. Kennedy has since hired security expert Gavin de Becker to investigate the situation, with the possibility of civil or criminal legal action on the horizon.<br />
<br />
“This had nothing to do with romance. He was being chased by porn,” de Becker was quoted as saying by The New York Post.<br />
<br />
A source told The New York Post that Nuzzi was the aggressor, although both parties were reportedly aware of the high-stakes nature of the situation, leading to sporadic communication.<br />
<br />
Kennedy, who recently dropped his independent presidential run and endorsed former President Donald Trump, is married to actress Cheryl Hines. He was wearing his wedding ring during a recent interview, but Hines has been spotted in public without hers.</p>

<p>Nuzzi's engagement to political reporter Ryan Lizza was also called off after details of her alleged sexting with Kennedy surfaced.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>"What have you done?" A mother's haunting question pierced the air after she discovered a human foot near their family van in Texas, US. Richard Ranner Ozment, 36, was arrested after allegedly attacking and killing 38-year-old Michaela Brooker with a machete-like weapon following a suspected domestic disturbance, Texas local media KWTX reported.</p>

<p>The incident took place on Saturday, September 21, around 9 am when deputies from the McLennan County Sheriff's Office responded to a call from a residence on Old China Spring Road. According to the sheriff's affidavit, Ozment's mother told deputies she walked outside her home and saw her son sweating profusely. When she tried to move past him, she stumbled upon Ms Brooker's severely injured body.</p>

<p>Ozment allegedly blocked his mother's path but, after being confronted, claimed that Ms Brooker had "tried to stab [him]," according to the sheriff's affidavit.</p>

<p>Panicked, the mother rushed inside while Ozment's father called 911. First responders arrived quickly, but Ozment fled the scene. China Spring firefighters were the first to spot him running away, but authorities couldn't locate him until 10 hours later when he was found hiding in a stock tank not far from the property.</p>

<p>Emergency responders treated Ms Brooker for severe injuries, particularly to her head, but she was later airlifted to a hospital, where she succumbed to her wounds.</p>

<p>Ozment, arrested, is now facing murder charges, with a $1 million bond.</p>

<p>McLennan County Sheriff Parnell McNamara was outraged over the killing, calling it "one of the most horrific, brutal, and senseless attacks that we have seen in a long time."</p>

<p>Richard Ozment has a lengthy criminal record dating back to his teens. At 16, he was convicted of aggravated sexual assault. Over the years, he faced various charges, including terroristic threats, failing to register as a sex offender and burglary. Ozment was paroled after serving only 10 years, despite a 40-year prison sentence for past crimes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"This never should have happened," Sheriff McNamara said. "He never should have gotten out, but he did."</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The "extremely dangerous" Hurricane Helene made landfall in the US state of Florida on Thursday, with officials warning of "unsurvivable" conditions and a potentially catastrophic storm surge high enough to swamp a two-story house.</p>

<p>More than a million people were without power and roads were already flooded ahead of what is expected to be one of the largest Gulf of Mexico storms in decades.</p>

<p>Fast-moving Helene strengthened to an "extremely dangerous" Category 4 hurricane Thursday, with the eye hitting near the town of Perry at approximately 11:10 pm local time (0310 GMT Friday), the US National Hurricane Center said.</p>

<p>It was packing winds of 140 miles (225 kilometres) per hour as it passed over the Gulf's warm waters and began hitting the Big Bend area south of Tallahassee.</p>

<p>"EVERYONE along the Florida Big Bend coast is at risk of potentially catastrophic storm surge," the NHC said on social media.</p>

<p>Tampa and Tallahassee airports have closed, with parts of St Petersburg, downtown Tampa, Sarasota, Treasure Island and other cities on Florida's west coast already flooded.</p>

<p>About 1,036,553 homes and businesses were without power, according to tracking site PowerOutage.us.</p>

<p>"We're expecting to see a storm surge inundation of 15 to 20 feet above ground level," NHC director Mike Brennan said. "That's up to the top of a second-story building. Again, a really unsurvivable scenario is going to play out here in this portion of the Florida coastline."</p>

<p>The accompanying waves "can destroy houses, move cars, and that water level is going to rise very quickly," Brennan added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>US President Joe Biden urged people to heed official evacuation warnings.</p>

<p>"I urge everyone in and near the path of Helene to listen to local officials and follow evacuation warnings," he said. "Take this seriously, and be safe."</p>

<h3><strong>'I'm stuck with them'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Authorities in Florida's Taylor County asked residents who did not act on mandatory evacuation warnings to write their names on their bodies with permanent marker, to aid in identification if they are killed.</p>

<p>In Alligator Point, a coastal town on a picturesque peninsula in the storm's path, David Wesolowski was taking no chances.</p>

<p>"I just came to button up a few things before it gets too windy," the 37-year-old real estate agent told AFP as he boarded up his house on stilts.</p>

<p>"If it stays on course, this is going to look different afterwards, that's for sure," he said.</p>

<p>Patrick Riickert refused to budge from his small wooden house in Crawfordville, a town of 5,000 people a few miles inland.</p>

<p>Most residents have bolted, but Riickert, his wife and five grandchildren were "not going anywhere," the 58-year-old insisted.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I am going to hunker down" and ride out the hurricane, as he did in 2018 when deadly Hurricane Michael, a Category 5 mega-storm, blew through the Florida panhandle.</p>

<p>At a gas station in Panacea, John Luper said he was reluctantly staying put because his mother and brother refused to flee to higher ground.</p>

<p>"They're not going to leave," he said, filling jerry cans with fuel. "I'm stuck with them."</p>

<p>The NHC warned of up to 20 inches (51 cm) of rain in some spots and potentially life-threatening flooding, as well as numerous landslides across the southern Appalachians.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The National Weather Service said the region could be hit extremely hard, with floods not seen in more than a century.</p>

<p>"This will be one of the most significant weather events to happen in the western portions of the area in the modern era," it warned.</p>

<p>Tornado warnings went out across northern Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas.</p>

<p>More than 55 million Americans were under some form of weather alert or warning from Hurricane Helene.</p>

<h3><strong>&nbsp;'Multi-state event'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>"This is going to be a multi-state event with the potential for significant impacts from Florida all the way to Tennessee," Federal Emergency Management Agency administrator Deanne Criswell told reporters.</p>

<p>Vice President Kamala Harris said the White House was watching.</p>

<p>"The President and I, of course, are monitoring the case and the situation closely, and we urge everyone who is watching at this very moment to take this storm very seriously," she told reporters.</p>

<p>Florida Governor Ron DeSantis mobilized the National Guard and ordered thousands of personnel to be ready for search-and-rescue operations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He warned that the powerful storm would be dangerous and urged everyone to take precautions.</p>

<p>"We can't control how strong this hurricane is going to get. We can't control the track of the hurricane, but what you can control is what you can do to put yourself in the best chance to be able to ride this out in a way that's going to be safe," DeSantis said.</p>

<p>Helene could become the most powerful hurricane to hit the United States in over a year -- and almost certainly the biggest, at nearly 500 miles across.</p>

<p>Scientists say climate change likely plays a role in the rapid intensification of hurricanes because there is more energy in warmer oceans for them to feed on.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p>

<p>The World Health Organization said Thursday that at least a quarter of those hurt in the war raging in Gaza have suffered "life-changing injuries", many requiring amputations and other "huge" rehabilitation needs.</p>

<p>At least 22,500 of the people injured in Gaza in the 11 months since the war erupted will "requires rehabilitation services now and for years to come", the WHO said in a statement.</p>

<p>"The huge surge in rehabilitation needs occurs in parallel with the ongoing decimation of the health system," Rik Peeperkorn, the WHO's representative for the Palestinian territories, said in a statement.</p>

<p>According to the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza, at least 41,118 people have been killed in Israel's retaliatory offensive following the October 7 attack by Hamas militants, while over 95,000 have been wounded.</p>

<p>The Hamas attack inside Israel that sparked the war resulted in the deaths of 1,205 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures, which also includes hostages killed in captivity.</p>

<p>Pointing to a fresh analysis of the types of injuries resulting from the conflict, the UN health agency said "many thousands of women and children" figured among those badly injured and that many had suffered more than one injury.</p>

<p>It estimated there had overall been between 13,455 and 17,550 "severe limb injuries", which it said were the main driver of the need for rehabilitation.</p>

<p>The report showed that between 3,105 and 4,050 limb amputations had occurred.</p>

<p>Other life-altering injuries including spinal cord injury, traumatic brain injury and major burn injuries, it said.</p>

<p>At the same time, WHO said only 17 of Gaza's 36 hospitals are currently even partially functional, while primary health care services are frequently suspended or inaccessible due to insecurity, attacks and repeated evacuation orders.</p>

<p>Gaza's only limb reconstruction and rehabilitation centre, located in Nasser Medical Complex and supported by WHO ceased functioning last December due to lack of supplies and specialised health workers.</p>

<p>"Tragically, much of the rehabilitation workforce in Gaza is now displaced," the statement said.</p>

<p>Peeperkorn said that "patients can't get the care they need".</p>

<p>"Acute rehabilitation services are severely disrupted and specialised care for complex injuries is not available, placing patients' lives at risk," he said.</p>

<p>"Immediate and long-term support is urgently needed to address the enormous rehabilitation needs."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A pioneering private crew made history Thursday by performing the first commercial spacewalk, with NASA hailing it as "a giant leap forward" for the space industry.</p>

<p>The SpaceX Polaris Dawn mission, led by fintech billionaire Jared Isaacman, launched Tuesday from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, journeying deeper into the cosmos than any humans in half a century, since the Apollo era.</p>

<p>With the four-member crew's Dragon spacecraft adjusted to an orbit with a high of 434 miles (700 kilometers), pure oxygen began flowing into their suits Thursday, marking the official start of their extravehicular activity (EVA) at 1012 GMT.</p>

<p>A short time later, Isaacman swung open the hatch and climbed through, gripping the hand and footholds of a structure known as "Skywalker," as a breathtaking view of Earth unfolded below him.</p>

<p>"SpaceX, back at home we all have a lot of work to do, but from here, Earth sure looks like a perfect world," he told mission control in Hawthorne, California, where teams erupted in applause.</p>

<p>It was yet another major milestone for SpaceX, the company founded by Elon Musk in 2002.</p>

<p>Since then, SpaceX has grown into a powerhouse that in 2020 beat aerospace giant Boeing in delivering a spaceship to provide rides for NASA astronauts to the International Space Station.</p>

<p>"Today's success represents a giant leap forward for the commercial space industry and NASA's long-term goal to build a vibrant US space economy," NASA chief Bill Nelson wrote on X.</p>

<p><strong>Suit tests</strong></p>

<p>Prior to the hatch opening, the crew underwent a "prebreathe" procedure to remove nitrogen from their bloodstream, preventing decompression sickness. Cabin pressure was then gradually lowered to align with the vacuum of space.</p>

<p>Isaacman and crewmate Sarah Gillis, a SpaceX engineer, took turns outside the vehicle, spending a few minutes performing mobility tests on SpaceX's next-generation suits that boast heads-up displays, helmet cameras and enhanced joint mobility systems -- before returning inside.</p>

<p>Extravehicular activity officially ended after an hour and 46 minutes, following cabin re-pressurization.</p>

<p>While it marked a first for the commercial sector, the spacewalk fell short of the daring feats from the early space era.</p>

<p>Early spacewalkers, including the first, Soviet cosmonaut Alexei Leonov in 1965, floated tethered to their spacecraft, while a select few Space Shuttle astronauts used jetpacks to fly completely untethered.</p>

<p>Since Dragon doesn't have an airlock, the entire crew were exposed to the vacuum of space. Mission pilot Scott Poteet and SpaceX engineer Anna Menon remained strapped in throughout as they monitored vital support systems.</p>

<p>"The risk is greater than zero, that's for sure, and it's certainly higher than anything that has been accomplished on a commercial basis," former NASA administrator Sean O'Keefe told AFP.</p>

<p><strong>First of three Polaris missions</strong></p>

<p>The spacewalk followed an audacious first phase of the mission, during which the Dragon spacecraft reached a peak altitude of 870 miles -- three times higher than the International Space Station, in a region teeming with dangerous, high-energy particles.</p>

<p>All four underwent more than two years of training in preparation for the landmark mission, logging hundreds of hours on simulators as well as skydiving, scuba diving and summiting an Ecuadoran volcano.</p>

<p>Upcoming tasks include testing laser-based satellite communications between the spacecraft and the vast Starlink satellite constellation, and completing dozens of experiments, including tests on contact lenses with embedded microelectronics to monitor changes in eye pressure and shape in space.</p>

<p>Polaris Dawn is the first of three missions under the Polaris program, a collaboration between Isaacman and SpaceX.</p>

<p>Financial terms of the partnership remain under wraps, but Isaacman, the 41-year-old founder and CEO of Shift4Payments, reportedly poured $200 million of his fortune into leading the 2021 all-civilian SpaceX Inspiration4 orbital mission.</p>

<p>The final Polaris mission aims to be the first crewed flight of SpaceX's Starship, a prototype next-generation rocket that is key to founder Musk's ambitions of colonizing Mars.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p>

<p>Israel announced on Thursday it was revoking the press credentials of Al Jazeera journalists working in the country, four months after shutting down the Qatari television network.</p>

<p>"The Government Press Office (GPO) is revoking the (press) cards of Al Jazeera journalists working in Israel," the Israeli government press office said in a statement.</p>

<p>"This is a media outlet that disseminates false content, which includes incitement against Israelis and Jews, and constitutes a threat to (Israeli) soldiers", the statement quoted press office director Nitzan Chen as saying.</p>

<p>An Israeli official close to the case told AFP that at the moment, the decision is to be applied to four full-time Al Jazeera journalists with Israeli citizenship.</p>

<p>The remainder of Al Jazeera staff in the country, mainly video producers and photographers who the government considers not to be actively producing content, will retain their Israeli press cards.</p>

<p>The GPO press card is not mandatory for working as a journalist in Israel, but without it, it is virtually impossible to access parliament or government ministries, or gain access to military infrastructure.</p>

<p>When contacted by AFP, Al Jazeera's bureau chief for the Palestinian territories, Walid Omary, said the network had not been informed of the latest Israeli decision.</p>

<p>"When we receive (the notification officially), we will see," Omary said.</p>

<p>The Israeli military has repeatedly accused journalists from the Qatari network of being "terrorist agents" in Gaza affiliated with Hamas or its ally, Islamic Jihad.</p>

<p>Al Jazeera denies the Israeli government's accusations and claims that Israel systematically targets its employees in the Gaza Strip.</p>

<p>At least two of its journalists have been killed since the war in Gaza began on October 7 after Hamas militants attacked southern Israel.</p>

<p>Fourteen Al Jazeera members of staff, all Israeli citizens, currently have Israeli government press cards, Omary said in a text message on a journalists' WhatsApp group.</p>

<p>The Israeli parliament passed a law in early April allowing the banning of foreign media broadcasts deemed harmful to state security.</p>

<p>Based on this law, the Israeli government approved on May 5 the decision to ban the channel from broadcasting from Israel and close its offices for a renewable 45-day period, which was extended for a fourth time by a Tel Aviv court on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government has had a long-running feud with Al Jazeera that has worsened since the Gaza war began.</p>

<p>"There will be no freedom of speech for the Hamas trumpets in Israel," Communications Minister Shlomo Karhi said in May.</p>

<p>"Al Jazeera will be closed immediately and the equipment will be confiscated."</p>

<p>The shutdown did not affect broadcasts from the Israeli-occupied West Bank or the Gaza Strip, from which Al Jazeera still covers Israel's war with Palestinian militants.</p>

<p>The GPO press card is not mandatory for working as a journalist in Israel, but without it, it is virtually impossible to access the Parliament, enter ministries, or gain access to military infrastructure.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ukraine plans to change its war strategy with the use of long-range cruise missiles targeting deep inside Russian territory. Kyiv's use of missiles has so far been within its own territory where the Russian military has invaded.</p>

<p>Recent reports suggest that the United Kingdom, a key NATO member, has cleared Ukraine's use of the Storm Shadow cruise missile to target Russian territories. This may push Moscow's red lines in the conflict.</p>

<p>Anticipating a shift in Ukraine's strategy, backed by its NATO allies, Russia, earlier this month, said it has become necessary for Moscow to revise its nuclear doctrine because of the West's escalation of the war in Ukraine.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="UK has reportedly cleared Ukraines use of the Storm Shadow cruise missile to target Russian territories." id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-09/vfa1jgto_storm-shadow-missile_625x300_12_September_24.jpeg" title="UK has reportedly cleared Ukraines use of the Storm Shadow cruise missile to target Russian territories." /></div>

<p class="ins_instory_dv_caption">UK has reportedly cleared Ukraine's use of the Storm Shadow cruise missile to target Russian territories.</p>
</div>

<p>This new development emerges at a time when the war between Russia and Ukraine has greatly intensified. Russia has increased its missile attacks while Ukraine has responded with escalation in drone attacks.</p>

<p>So far, there are restriction on the use of advanced western weaponry on targets within Russian territory, but this is likely to change with such clearances reportedly being issued by the UK.</p>

<p>Ukraine already has the Storm Shadow missile, but uses it only within its territory to combat Russian forces.</p>

<h2><strong>THE STORM SHADOW MISSILE</strong></h2>

<p>The Storm Shadow is a low-observable, long-range air-launched cruise missile. It is jointly developed by the United Kingdom and France and has a range of around 500 km. It has already been integrated into Ukrainian fighter aircraft, including the Russia-built Su-24 bombers - a legacy of the past, from when Ukraine was part of the erstwhile Soviet Union.</p>

<p class="ins_instory_dv_caption">The Storm Shadow is a low-observable, long-range air-launched cruise missile.</p>
</div>

<p>Developed in 1994 and manufactured by Matra and British Aerospace, the Storm Shadow missile is now made by MBDA Systems. 'Storm Shadow' is the weapon's British name, while in France it is called the SCALP-EG.</p>

</div>

<p>How the export of such long-range cruise missiles to Ukraine were permitted is not clear yet as the Missile Technology Control Regime or MTCR, which UK is a founding member of, restricts the export of missiles which have a range greater than 300 km and a payload capacity of 500 kg. While the Storm Shadow missile has a warhead less than 500 kg, it breaches the MTCR regulations in terms of range exceeding the limit.</p>

<p>The MTCR, however, is an informal political understanding between member states and its regulations are not always binding.</p>

<h3><strong>THE FALLOUT</strong></h3>

<p>Should Ukraine get the green signal to use cruise missiles to attack Russian territory, a Russian response to this could be massive. The international worry is that Moscow may seriously consider the use of nuclear weapons in such a scenario.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">

<p class="ins_instory_dv_caption">'Storm Shadow' is the weapon's British name, while in France it is called the SCALP-EG.</p>
</div>

<p>The Kremlin has blamed the "collective actions of the West" in Ukraine for Russia to revise its nuclear doctrine, spokesperson Dmitry Peskov had said earlier this month.</p>

<p>Without revealing what the changes will be to Russia's nuclear doctrine, Moscow has said that certain changes are required to be made on the policy over the circumstances for the use of its nukes.</p>

<p>President Vladimir Putin had set the current nuclear doctrine in place four years ago. According to that, Russia may use nuclear weapons in the scenario where it comes under a nuclear attack or if a conventional attack threatens the existence of the state.</p>

<p>An update to the Russian nuclear doctrine is now necessary "against the backdrop of the challenges and threats provoked by the countries of the so-called collective West", Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said.</p>

<p>"Moscow foresees the likelihood of Ukraine using long-range missiles and other weapons supplied by the United States and its NATO allies to attack deep inside Russian territory," Mr Peskov had said, adding that "Ukraine will obviously do this, and we are taking that into account."</p>

<h3><strong>INDIA ATTEMPTS FOR PEACE</strong></h3>

<p>India, meanwhile, is trying to broker peace between Russia and Ukraine with National Security Adviser Ajit Doval currently in Moscow for a summit of NSAs. He met Vladimir Putin on Thursday and is reportedly carrying a peace plan sent by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-08/jk1t0l38_modi-russia-ukraine_625x300_31_August_24.jpg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>PM Modi had visited Russia in July and followed that with a visit to Ukraine last month. He was received warmly both by Putin and Zelenskyy and is considered one of the very few leaders in the world to have a close bond with both leaders.</p>

<p>It is not known yet, if such a peace plan will be accepted by Russia, but India, which has friendly ties with both nations has offered to play its part in helping end the war.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar, when asked about the need for BRICS when a grouping like G20 already existed, responded that if the G7 can exist when there is the G20, there is no reason why BRICS cannot.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar, when asked about the need for BRICS when a grouping like G20 already existed, responded that if the G7 can exist when there is the G20, there is no reason why BRICS cannot.</p>

<p>Mr Jaishankar said this during a conversation with Ambassador Jean-David Levitte at Geneva Centre for Security Policy, a think tank.</p>

<p>BRICS was founded as an intergovernmental organisation by Brazil, Russia, India and China in 2009, with South Africa joining in later. In January this year, five new countries - Iran, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, UAE and Ethiopia - joined the bloc.</p>

<p>"Why the club? Because there was another club. It was called the G7 and you will not let anybody else into that club. So, we go and form our own club," the foreign minister said.</p>

<p>"I'm still struck by how insecure the (Global) North is when you speak about the BRICS. Somehow, something seems to get under people's skin," he said.</p>

<p>"Here's an observation. There is a G20, did the G7 disband? Has it stopped meeting? No, it still continues. So, the G20 exists, but the G7 still exists. Then, why can't the G20 be there and the BRICS also exist?" he said further.</p>

<p>Mr Jaishankar also talked about the Global South. "The countries of the Global South, most of them are decolonised countries. Most of them are developing countries," he explained. He termed it as "an intuitive gathering of countries who actually know why they are in that room and they have a feel for each other," he said.</p>

<p>The Indian foreign minister is currently on the third and final leg of his three-nation tour. He started off in Saudi Arabia for the first India-Gulf Cooperation Council Ministerial Meeting and went on to visit Germany.</p>

<p>He held wide-ranging talks with his German counterpart, Annalena Baerbock, and called on German Chancellor Olaf Scholz in Berlin.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>New York's top cop, head of the largest police department in the United States, resigned Thursday amid corruption probes swirling through the city's leadership.</p>

<p>The storied New York Police Department (NYPD) is a mammoth force including 35,000 uniformed officers and a budget of just under $6 billion.</p>

<p>Mayor Eric Adams announced the departure of Edward Caban, the New York City Police Department commissioner, in a brief televised statement.</p>

<p>"A short time ago, I accepted the resignation," he said, noting that he took ongoing federal probes into his administration "extremely seriously."</p>

<p>Adams said he was appointing veteran law enforcement officer Tom Donlon as the force's interim commissioner.</p>

<p>Caban, 57, had come under pressure to resign after federal agents seized his cellphone and those of other high-ranking members in the Adams administration.</p>

<p>No criminal charges have been filed and federal authorities have yet to clarify what they are probing. According to ABC News, one investigation is targeting city contracts and another enforcement of regulations on nightlife.</p>

<p>Adams, a former police officer and only the second Black mayor of the biggest US city, is increasingly weighed down by growing scandals, including a sexual assault allegation and claims of corruption.</p>

<p>Caban, appointed by Adams in 2023, is the first Latino NYPD commissioner.</p>

<p>In his statement, Adams addressed New Yorkers, telling them he "was as surprised as you" to hear of the federal probes.</p>

<p>"I spent more than 20 years in law enforcement, and so every member of the administration knows my expectations that we must follow the law," he said.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Moot, who believes "Life's too short" to miss out on such opportunities, purchased the house at 67% less than its 2022 asking price of $1.195 million.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>59-year-old David Moot, who is an interior painter and designer, has purchased a three-bedroom Cape Cod home for $395,000 (Rs 3,3153910). The house only stands 25 feet from the crumbling cliff facing the Atlantic Ocean. But Mr Moot is not scared by this situation, and he believes, "Life's too short to wait and not take advantage of this."</p>

<p>The sale is one of a growing number of purchases made by buyers who snap up bargain-priced waterfront homes imperilled by rising sea levels and crumbling coastlines because of climate change. The story's been covered by many big media houses, as such homes become increasingly in demand despite the risks.</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-12/oceanfront-property-owners-brace-for-value-plunge-as-seas-rise?srnd=wealth&amp;sref=fqqmZ8gi"><em>Bloomberg,</em></a> Moot's purchase of the home was 67% less than the seller's $1.195m asking price in 2022. Speaking about his purchase of the home, which rests a mere 25ft from a sandy slope, Moot told the outlet: "Life's too short, and I just said to myself, 'Let's just see what happens.'"</p>

<p>"It's going to eventually fall into the ocean, and it may or may not be in my lifetime," he added.</p>

<p>What Moot paid for the Eastham home was 67% less than the $1.195 million the seller initially sought in 2022. On Nantucket, an island retreat for the wealthy south of Cape Cod, a seaside house at 28 Sheep Pond Road sold in June for just $200,000, about a 10th of its assessed valuation this year.</p>

<p>As warming oceans spawn stronger, more frequent storms and sea levels rise, more than $106 billion in US coastal properties could be consumed by the ocean in less than 30 years, according to data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.</p>

<p>"The bottom line is, between 50 and 100 years from now, there are communities that will be underwater," Dylan McNamara, a professor of oceanography at the University of North Carolina Wilmington who has studied coastal real estate markets for nearly two decades told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-12/oceanfront-property-owners-brace-for-value-plunge-as-seas-rise?srnd=wealth&amp;sref=fqqmZ8gi"><em>Bloomberg.</em></a> "It's just a matter of time before those property values go down. How they go down, whether it's a precipitous drop off a cliff or it's a smoother unwinding, is still up in the air."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin said Thursday that the West letting Kyiv use longer-range weapons to strike Russian targets would mean NATO would be "at war" with Russia.</p>

<p>Putin spoke as US and UK top diplomats discussed easing rules on firing Western weapons into Russia, which Kyiv has been pressing for, more than two and a half years into Moscow's offensive.</p>

<p>"This would in a significant way change the very nature of the conflict," Putin told a state television reporter.</p>

<p>"It would mean that NATO countries, the US, European countries, are at war with Russia," he added.</p>

<p>"If that's the case, then taking into account the change of nature of the conflict, we will take the appropriate decisions based on the threats that we will face."</p>

<p>Clearing Kyiv to strike deep into Russia "is a decision on whether NATO countries are directly involved in the military conflict or not".</p>

<p>Putin's comments came as Kyiv pressed the West to provide more powerful weapons with fewer restrictions, as Russia continues its advance into eastern Ukraine.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Democratic U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris leads Republican Donald Trump 47% to 42% in the race to win the Nov. 5 presidential election, increasing her advantage after a debate against the former president that voters largely think she won, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll that closed on Thursday.</p>

<p>The two-day poll showed Harris with a five percentage point lead among registered voters, just above the four-point advantage she had over Trump in an Aug. 21-28 Reuters/Ipsos poll.</p>

<p>Among voters who said they had heard at least something about Tuesday's debate, 53% said Harris won and 24% said Trump won. Some 52% of respondents said that Trump stumbled and didn't appear sharp, while 21% said that of Harris.</p>

<p>Harris, 59, put Trump, 78, on the defensive in a combative presidential debate with a stream of attacks on his fitness for office and his myriad legal battles.</p>

<p>The poll surveyed 1,690 U.S. adults nationwide, including 1,405 registered voters. It had a margin of error of around three percentage points for registered voters.</p>

<p>While national surveys including Reuters/Ipsos' polls give important signals on the views of the electorate, the state-by-state results of the Electoral College determine the winner, with a handful of battleground states likely to be decisive.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Wild great apes often consume medicinal plants that can treat their ailments. The same plants are often used by local people in traditional medicine.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Scientists believe that gorillas could offer insights into future drug discoveries through their self-medicating behaviour, according to a new study. Four potentially medicinal tropical plants that are used by local healers have been found by researchers in Gabon through their investigation of the plants that wild gorillas eat. These plants are abundant in antioxidants and antimicrobials, and one of them may be able to fight superbugs according to laboratory experiments.</p>

<p>The study was conducted by Leresche Even Doneilly Oyaba Yinda from the Interdisciplinary Medical Research Centre of Franceville in Gabon and colleagues, and it was published on September 11 in the open-access<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0306957"><em> journal PLOS ONE.</em></a></p>

<p>As per <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2024/09/240911142129.htm">a release,</a> to investigate, researchers observed the behaviour of western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla) in Moukalaba-Doudou National Park in Gabon and recorded the plants they ate. Next, they interviewed 27 people living in the nearby village of Doussala, including traditional healers and herbalists, about the plants that were used in local traditional medicine.</p>

<p>The team identified four native plant species that are both consumed by gorillas and used in traditional medicine: the fromager tree (Ceiba pentandra), giant yellow mulberry (Myrianthus arboreus), African teak (Milicia excelsa), and fig trees (Ficus). They tested bark samples of each plant for antibacterial and antioxidant properties and investigated their chemical composition.</p>

<p>The researchers found that the bark of all four plants had antibacterial activity against at least one multidrug-resistant strain of the bacterium Escherichia coli. The fromager tree showed "remarkable activity" against all tested E coli strains. All four plants contained compounds that have medicinal effects, including phenols, alkaloids, flavonoids, and proanthocyanidins. However, it's not clear if gorillas consume these plants for medicinal or other reasons.</p>

<p>Biodiverse regions, such as central Africa, are home to a huge reservoir of unexplored and potentially medicinal plants.</p>

<p>This research provides preliminary insights about plants with antibacterial and antimicrobial properties, and the four plants investigated in this study might be promising targets for further drug discovery research, particularly with the aim of treating multidrug-resistant bacterial infections.</p>

<p>The <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2024/09/240911142129.htm">authors of the study add:</a> "Alternative medicines and therapies offer definite hope for the resolution of many present and future public health problems. Zoopharmacognosy is one of these new approaches, aimed at discovering new drugs."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prosecutors are preparing to retry Harvey Weinstein on rape charges after a previous conviction against the former Hollywood producer was overturned.</p>

<p>Weinstein, who is currently at New York's Rikers Island prison, was rushed to Bellevue Hospital on Sunday to undergo emergency heart surgery after experiencing severe chest pains.</p>

<p>His lawyers are expected in court on Thursday. However, it is unclear whether he will present as his lawyers have said he has health problems.</p>

<p>The judge overseeing the case has set November 12 as a tentative trial date.</p>

<p>The 72-year-old is serving a 16-year sentence after being convicted on rape charges by a California court. He had also been found guilty of the rape and sexual assault of actor Jessica Mann and of forcibly performing oral sex on production assistant Miriam Haley by a New York court in February 2020.</p>

<p>But the New York Court of Appeals overturned the conviction in April, saying that Weinstein did not get a fair trial because a judge allowed testimony by accusers he was not formally charged with assaulting.</p>

<p>This was one of the defining cases of the Me Too movement. Weinstein has denied any non consensual sexual encounters with anyone.</p>

<p>At a July hearing, prosecutors with the Manhattan District Attorney's Office said they intend to bring new charges for "additional violent sexual assaults" of more women who have agreed to testify.</p>

<p>More than 80 women have accused Weinstein of sexual misconduct.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Last week, British prosecutors dropped indecent assault charges against the Miramax film studio co-founder after concluding there was no realistic chance of securing a conviction.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Hubble Telescope, which has served as humankind's eye in space, has captured stunning images over the decades. This time, the powerful machine clicked a few pictures of the stunning Red Spider Nebula. Located approximately 3,000 light-years away in the constellation Sagittarius, this planetary nebula&nbsp;is home to one of the most scorching stars in the universe, with surface temperatures reaching as high as 250,000°C (450,000°F).</p>

<p>According to NASA, this intense heat energises the surrounding gas, generating massive shockwaves that stretch an astonishing 62 billion miles (100 billion km) into space. These shockwaves sculpt the nebula's distinctive spider-leg-like arcs, which appear to emanate from the central star.</p>

<p>NASA described the images as, ''Orange waves of hot gas, resembling the curved legs of a black widow spider, surround a pinkish glowing core in this image of a planetary nebula. The background is spotted with white points of light.''</p>

<p>The fascinating images of the ''Cosmic Spider'' have delighted the internet. Shared just a few days ago, the post has already racked up more than 600,000 likes and sparked a frenzy of comments from awestruck users who couldn't get enough of the celestial wonder.&nbsp;</p>

<p>One user wrote, ''Does this red spider nebula have any other names? Does it have any other origin? Well, this is the only spider I love and am not scared of!''</p>

<p>Another commented, ''WOW....The head and a big eye and the hand...and the leg and the tail in the second pic.....Wonderful what I see.'' A third said, ''Celestial entanglement.'' A fourth added, ''Alright, this is the most beautiful thing I saw today, thank you.''</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Atrial fibrillation (A-Fib) is a serious condition with a wide range of potentially life-threatening complications.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>New research from the University of California San Francisco has revealed that atrial fibrillation (A-Fib), a potentially life-threatening heart condition characterised by a rapid and irregular heartbeat, affects a staggering 10.5 million adults in the US, approximately 5% of the population. The rising prevalence of A-Fib is attributed to the ageing population and growing rates of hypertension, diabetes, and obesity.&nbsp;The condition can lead to stroke or sudden death, the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.jacc.org/doi/10.1016/j.jacc.2024.07.014">study noted.&nbsp;</a></p>

<p>"Atrial fibrillation doubles the risk of mortality, is one of the most common causes of stroke, increases risks of heart failure, myocardial infarction, chronic kidney disease and dementia, and results in lower quality of life," said first author Jean Jacques Noubiap, MD, PhD, a postdoctoral scholar at UCSF with a speciality in global cardiovascular health.</p>

<p>"Fortunately, atrial fibrillation is preventable, and early detection and appropriate treatment can substantially reduce its adverse outcomes," he added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A recent study by UCSF investigators analysed the medical records of approximately 30 million adult patients in California who received acute or procedural care between 2005 and 2019. The researchers found that:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Around 2 million patients (6.67%) had been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation (A-Fib).</li>
	<li>The prevalence of A-Fib increased significantly over the study period, rising from 4.49% of patients treated between 2005-2009 to&nbsp;6.82% of patients treated between 2015-2019</li>
</ul>

<p>Atrial fibrillation (A-Fib) is a serious condition with a wide range of potentially life-threatening complications, including mild symptoms like shortness of breath, and light-headedness and severe complications like blood clots, stroke, and heart failure. Research has shown that individuals with A-Fib are up to five times more likely to experience a stroke.</p>

<p>The current analysis is based on medical records and diagnoses, but digital technologies such as wearable devices, mobile apps, and electronic health records may uncover even more cases of atrial fibrillation (A-Fib).</p>

<p>"With the growing use of consumer wearables designed to detect atrial fibrillation combined with safer and more effective means to treat it, this current prevalence of atrial fibrillation in health care settings may soon be dwarfed by future health care utilization that will occur due to the disease," Gregory M. Marcus, MD, MAS, a cardiologist and electrophysiologist at UCSF Health said.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Russian strike on Red Cross vehicles in eastern Ukraine killed three people, the country's president Volodymyr Zelensky said Thursday.</p>

<p>"Today, the occupier attacked the vehicles of the International Committee of the Red Cross humanitarian mission in Donetsk region," Volodymyr Zelensky said.</p>

<p>The International Committee of the Red Cross confirmed that three of its staffers had been killed when shelling hit a site of a planned frontline aid distribution in the region.</p>

<p>It did not say who was behind the shelling.</p>

<p>"I condemn attacks on Red Cross personnel in the strongest terms,"</p>

<p>ICRC President Mirjana Spoljaric said in a statement.</p>

<p>"It's unconscionable that shelling would hit an aid distribution site," he added.</p>

<p>"Our hearts are broken today as we mourn the loss of our colleagues and care for the injured," she said.</p>

<p>"This tragedy unleashes a wave of grief all too familiar to those who have lost loved ones in armed conflict."</p>

<p>The attack happened in the village of Virolyubivka, a dozen of kilometres away from the front line in Donetsk.</p>

<p>The ICRC said its team had been preparing to distribute wood and coal briquettes to vulnerable households to help them prepare for winter when their vehicles were hit.</p>

<p>Two other staff members were wounded in the attack, ICRC said, adding that the aid distribution "had not begun, and no residents were affected by the explosion".</p>

<p>The ICRC did not provide any details about the staff members killed, but Ukrainian parliamentary commissioner for human rights Dmytro Lubinets said they were Ukrainian citizens.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicles 'clearly marked'</strong></p>

<p>There was no immediate comment from Russia, which routinely says it only hits military targets.</p>

<p>ICRC highlighted that its teams "are regularly present in the Donetsk region, and our vehicles are clearly marked with the Red Cross emblem".</p>

<p>"The deaths of three ICRC colleagues come amid a sharp rise in the number of humanitarians killed around the world over the last two years," it lamented.</p>

<p>The UN Humanitarian mission to Ukraine said 50 workers were killed or injured in Ukraine in 2023, including 11 killed in the line of duty.</p>

<p>"Since the beginning of the year, this repeated pattern of attacks appears to have intensified," the UN humanitarian coordinator Denise Brown said in a statement in February.</p>

<p>The ICRC urgently called in Thursday's statement "for the respect of international humanitarian law, including by taking every precaution possible to ensure that those engaged in humanitarian activities are not targeted or caught in hostilities".</p>

<p>Thursday's strike came just days before Spoljaric is due to carry out a long-planned visit to Moscow -- her second visit since Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022, ICRC spokesman Jason Straziuso told AFP.</p>

<p>She is due to meet with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and other senior government officials on "critical issues in conflicts globally, such as the respect of international humanitarian law, prisoners of war, the fate of the missing, and protections for humanitarian workers," he said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Irony struck hard when Dame Diana Johnson, the UK's police and crime minister, had her purse stolen from a hotel where she was speaking to senior police officers at a government conference. This incident raised concerns about efficiency and security, according to<em> the BBC.</em></p>

<p>The <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdx6xvvn25xo"><em>news portal </em></a>further reported that thieves struck, while Dame Diana blamed the Conservatives for an "epidemic of antisocial behaviour, theft, and shoplifting" at the annual Police Superintendents' Association conference. A 56-year-old man from Coventry has been arrested on suspicion of burglary and released on bail in connection to the incident, Warwickshire Police said. The Home Office confirmed that Johnson had her belongings stolen at the conference and said that no security risks had been identified.</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ft.com/content/21fd0bb9-d561-4125-ac9b-784a77c372f1"><em>The Financial Times</em></a>, the theft came on the same day that the government began releasing some prisoners early to deal with jail overcrowding in England and Wales. The strains on the criminal justice system have been worsened by an outbreak of rioting in August. PSA president Nick Smart, in his address to the conference, decried "chronic underinvestment" in policing in recent years that he said had left forces "financially drowning" and "operating on a shoestring.".</p>

<p>Nick Smart criticised the handling of overcrowding in prisons and prisoner releases, saying police officers faced "the prospect of arresting offenders who can then not be placed in prison and dealing with the fallout from the thousands of criminals being released early today, many potentially without proper rehabilitation and release plans."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Harvey Weinstein has been hit with new criminal charges in New York, a prosecutor said in court on Thursday, as the Manhattan district attorney's office prepares to retry the former movie mogul following the reversal of his rape conviction.</p>

<p>Jurors in Manhattan found Weinstein, 72, guilty on rape charges in 2020, but the New York Court of Appeals threw out the conviction in April, finding Weinstein did not get a fair trial because a judge improperly allowed testimony by accusers he was not formally charged with assaulting.</p>

<p>Manhattan prosecutors said in July that they were investigating additional violent sexual assaults allegedly committed by Weinstein after more women agreed to testify against the Miramax studio co-founder. He has denied ever having non-consensual sexual encounters with anyone.</p>

<p>Prosecutor Nicole Blumberg did not specify the new charges Weinstein faces during a hearing before Judge Curtis Farber in New York state court in Manhattan.</p>

<p>Farber has tentatively set a trial date for Nov. 12, but has said he is open to considering an earlier start.</p>

<p>Weinstein's lawyer has said it was unfair for prosecutors to seek to add additional victims to the case after the conviction was overturned.</p>

<p>"Once again we have a hotline: '1-800 Get Harvey," defense attorney Arthur Aidala said in court on July 9.</p>

<p>The onetime Hollywood kingmaker's health has deteriorated significantly in recent years, according to his representatives, and he is confined to a wheelchair due to back problems.</p>

<p>Despite the reversal of his New York conviction, Weinstein has remained in custody at the Rikers Island jail complex because of a separate rape conviction in California.</p>

<p>He was moved to the prison ward of a New York hospital in July with multiple ailments including COVID-19.</p>

<p>Weinstein's initial conviction in New York was a milestone for the #MeToo movement, in which women accused hundreds of men in entertainment, media, politics and other fields of sexual misconduct.</p>

<p>A jury found Weinstein sexually assaulted former production assistant Miriam Haley in 2006 and raped aspiring actress Jessica Mann in 2013. They are among more than 80 women who have accused him of sexual misconduct.</p>

<p>Weinstein was sentenced to 23 years in prison for the New York case, and to 16 years in prison for the separate California case.</p>

<p>In that case, a Los Angeles jury found Weinstein guilty of rape, forcible oral copulation and sexual penetration by a foreign object involving one woman, but acquitted him of charges relating to a second accuser.</p>

<p>The judge overseeing the case declared a mistrial on the counts where the jury could not reach a verdict, including the allegations made by Siebel Newsom, the wife of California Governor Gavin Newsom.</p>

<p>The California conviction was not affected by the New York top court's decision. Weinstein has not begun serving the California sentence.</p>

<p>Miramax's hit movies included "Shakespeare in Love" and "Pulp Fiction." Weinstein's film studio filed for bankruptcy in March 2018 after the allegations against him precipitated its implosion.</p>

<p>In the New York trial, portrayed Weinstein as a serial predator who had manipulated women with promises of career advancement in Hollywood, coaxing them to hotel rooms or private apartments and then overpowering and violently attacking them.</p>

<p>During his sentencing hearing in Manhattan in 2020, Weinstein said he was worried about the "thousands of men who are losing due process" during the #MeToo movement.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Recent research reveals that Covid-19 lockdowns have led to premature brain ageing in adolescents, with girls showing more significant changes than boys.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The teen years, a crucial phase in human development marked by the transition from adolescence to adulthood, have been significantly affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. The Covid-19 seriously changed this activity. Recent medical research pointed out that the Covid-19 social restrictions have struck at the very fragile phase of human development, especially in adolescent girls.</p>

<p><strong>Premature Brain Ageing Observed</strong></p>

<p>In 2022, researchers found evidence of premature brain ageing in teens who had faced Covid lockdowns. New research suggests one group bore the brunt of the burden.</p>

<p>The latest study, which was published in <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2403200121"><em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,</em></a> is the first to reveal stark differences between boys and girls.</p>

<p>MRI scans have revealed that, on average, girls' brains appear approximately 4.2 years older than expected following lockdowns, while boys' brains show an average ageing of 1.4 years.</p>

<p><strong>Concerns for Mental Health and Learning</strong></p>

<p>Although the precise implications of these changes are still under investigation, there are growing concerns about their potential impact on adolescents' mental health and cognitive abilities. The study underscores the need for further research to understand the long-term effects of pandemic-related disruptions on young people's development.</p>

<p>"Social isolation due to lockdowns that were imposed because of the Covid-19 pandemic had a detrimental impact on adolescent mental health, with the mental health of females more affected than males. We assessed the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic lockdowns on adolescent brain structure with a focus on sex differences. We collected MRI structural data longitudinally from adolescents prior to and after the pandemic lockdowns," said the authors of the study.</p>

<p>"The pre-Covid data were used to create a normative model of cortical thickness change with age during typical adolescent development. Cortical thickness values in the post-Covid data were compared to this normative model. The analysis revealed accelerated cortical thinning in the post-Covid brain, which was more widespread throughout the brain and greater in magnitude in females than in males."</p>

<p>"When measured in terms of equivalent years of development, the mean acceleration was found to be 4.2 years in females and 1.4 years in males. Accelerated brain maturation as a result of chronic stress or adversity during development has been well documented. These findings suggest that the lifestyle disruptions associated with the Covid-19 pandemic lockdowns caused changes in brain biology and had a more severe impact on the female than the male brain."</p>

<p>The results emphasizes the need for continued support and targeted interventions to address the developmental challenges faced by today's youth in the wake of the pandemic.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Sources had said that Mr Doval's visit to Russia would be aimed at resolving the Russia-Ukraine conflict.&nbsp;He was carrying PM Modi's peace plan for President Putin, sources said.</p>

<p>In the talks, the Russian leader expressed hopes that PM Modi will travel to Russia's Kazan next month to attend the annual BRICS summit.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mr Putin also proposed to hold a bilateral meeting with PM Modi on October 22 on the sidelines of the BRICS summit to summarise the outcomes of joint work on the implementation of the agreements reached during his visit to Moscow and to outline prospects for the near future, the Russian Embassy said in a statement released on Telegram.</p>

<p>"We are waiting for our good friend Modi and best regards to him," the Russian media quoted Putin as saying in the meeting.</p>

<p>A new statue of Queen Elizabeth II has met mixed reviews, with one non-plussed critic assessing that it looks more like "an old lady buying potatoes at the market" than Britain's longest-reigning monarch.</p>

<p>The statue of the queen, who died in September 2022 aged 96, was unveiled last week in Antrim Castle Gardens park in Northern Ireland, and also features her husband Prince Philip and two of her beloved corgi dogs.</p>

<p>Antrim and Newtownabbey Borough Council said at the unveiling that the work captures "Her Majesty in a dignified pose, reflecting her grace, steadfastness and lifelong dedication to public service".</p>

<p>The local authority posted images of artist Anto Brennan's work on its social media sites but switched off comments after adverse comments.</p>

<p>One online commentator even likened it to Robin Williams's elderly female housekeeper Mrs Doubtfire in the 1993 Hollywood comedy-drama.</p>

<p>But while the council conceded that art can prompt "diverse opinions", it said it was "delighted" with the "generally positive" response.</p>

<p>Walking his dog at the gardens on Wednesday, Ivor Ritchie, 67, called the sculpture "terrible". "It looks no more like her than the man-in-the-moon," he said.</p>

<p>"I just don't think it looks like her face," added another passer-by, Eddie Smyth, a 52-year-old labourer also from Antrim, a half-hour drive northwest of Belfast.</p>

<p>English tourist Lorraine Barker, 58, agreed. "In fact the corgis are better than the queen I'd say," she told AFP.</p>

<p>The sculpture, one of the first of the queen in the UK since her death, is attracting increasing attention -- and curious visitors to the 400-year-old gardens.</p>

<p>"We came over to see it as we'd heard people talking about it," said Noel Wilson, 62, who drove from the nearby town of Ballymena with his wife Dorothy, 61, to have a look.</p>

<p>Hungarian tourist Gabor Laszlo, 50, struggled to see the queen's likeness but conceded: "Prince Philip is OK."</p>

<p>The queen, who ruled for 70 years, is depicted in a country jacket and tweed skirt, wearing a headscarf and carrying her trademark handbag.</p>

<p>Laszlo was unimpressed, saying it made her look "like an old lady at the market buying some potatoes".</p>

<p>Yet the depiction still has its fans.</p>

<p>"It's a really good replica of how warmly and fondly she is remembered by the British public, I think it's an excellent job," said English visitor Stephen Barker.</p>

<p>For 90-year-old Canadian tourist Roy Hill the work is "a wonderful depiction, very impressive".</p>

<p>"It brings back a lot of memories, I am old enough to remember Queen Elizabeth as a young person, at the coronation," he said.</p>

<p>Another local out for a walk in the park, Muriel McCandless, 81, expressed sympathy with the sculptor, who has yet to comment on the controversy.</p>

<p>"I actually think it's quite good," she laughed.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[As global warming intensifies, the new travel trend "coolcation" emerges, reflecting a shift towards cooler destinations. With extreme heat impacting southern Europe, northern and central countries are becoming more attractive to tourists.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As global warming is hitting every inch of the planet and heatwaves intensify all over the world, a new kind of travel trend has emerged: the "coolcation", according to a report by <em>Deutsche Welle</em>. A combination of two words, "cool" and "vacation," it speaks volumes about people's growing penchant for cooler destinations as traditional sun-seeking vacations are increasingly seen as less appealing because of climate change.</p>

<p>The Swedish tourism association, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://visitsweden.com/">Visit Sweden</a>, champions this shift, asserting that travellers are increasingly drawn to destinations with moderate temperatures. Their website highlights the transition from chasing heat to seeking respite in cooler climates. Similarly, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.visitnorway.com/">Visit Norway</a> is promoting northern escapes as a refreshing alternative to the intense summer heat in southern Europe.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/webstories/science/climate-change-sparks-interest-in-coolcation-24150"><strong>Also Read | Climate Change Sparks Interest In "Coolcation"</strong></a></p>

<p>According to the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.dw.com/en/coolcation-is-climate-change-transforming-travel/a-70187090"><em>DW report,</em></a> recent climate data confirms this trend: Spain and Italy saw their hottest years on record in 2022 and 2023; Greece also saw severe droughts and fires. Such conditions mean that extreme heat is likely to persist in southern Europe, which could change the face of tourism.</p>

<p>According to the EU Commission, tourism flows are shifting; northern and central countries are expected to gain, while southern destinations will be losers. On the winners' side will be countries such as Denmark, Finland, and Sweden, whereas countries such as Greece and Spain might lose as much as 30% of their tourism income.</p>

<p>Despite these changes, many travellers still favour warm climates. A European Travel Commission survey reveals that 74% of respondents are adapting to climate change by avoiding extreme temperatures. However, in Germany, traditional preferences for sunny destinations persist, with northern Europe accounting for a minor share of their travel.</p>

<p>While the "coolcation" may be gaining attention, experts caution that it's too early to confirm a decisive trend. Changes in travel behaviour due to climate change may take decades to fully materialise.</p>]]></content:encoded>

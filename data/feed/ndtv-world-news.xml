       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel's Iron Dome air defence system has intercepted thousands of rockets since it went into operation in 2011, providing the country with crucial cover during times of conflict.</p>

<p>It has been heavily relied upon to protect military and civilian sites from frequent barrages of rockets fired from Gaza and Lebanon in the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas.</p>

<p>Israel's air defences were in operation on Tuesday night when Iran fired missiles at Israel in what it said was a response to Israel's killing of Tehran-backed militant leaders.</p>

<p>Israel's military chief Herzi Halevi said Tuesday that the Iranian barrage had been blunted partly by "a very strong aerial defence array".</p>

<p>The system had also intercepted more than 200 drones and missiles launched by Iran on April 13.</p>

<p>Israel initially developed the Iron Dome alone after the 2006 Lebanon War and was later joined by the United States, which has provided its defence know-how and billions of dollars in financial support for the program.</p>

<p>The system has an interception rate of around 90 per cent, according to Israeli defence firm Rafael, which helped design it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Here's how it works:</p>

<h3><strong>Three-part system</strong></h3>

<p>The Iron Dome is one part of Israel's multi-tiered missile defence systems and is designed to intercept short-range rockets at a distance of up to 70 kilometres (43 miles).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Each Iron Dome battery is made up of three main sections: a radar detection system, a computer to calculate the incoming rocket's trajectory, and a launcher that fires interceptors if the rocket is deemed likely to hit a built-up or strategic area.</p>

<p>It sits alongside other missile defence systems like the Arrow, which counters ballistic missiles, and David's Sling, for medium-range rocket or missile attacks.</p>

<h3><strong>How much does it cost?</strong></h3>

<p>Each Iron Dome interceptor costs $40,000 to $50,000 to produce, according to the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The think tank estimated that a complete system, including the radar, computer and three to four launchers -- each containing up to 20 interceptors -- costs around $100 million to produce.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Israel has 10 such systems in operation, according to Raytheon, which helps manufacture the Iron Dome. Other estimates have put the figure slightly higher.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Bipartisan US support</strong></h3>

<p>The Iron Dome is one of the strategic pillars of the US-Israeli alliance that has been followed by successive Democratic and Republican administrations.</p>

<p>In August 2019 the US Army signed a contract to purchase two Iron Dome batteries to enhance its own short-range missile defence capabilities.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar said on Tuesday that India is "very much" concerned at the possibility of broadening of the conflict in the Middle East.</p>

<p>Speaking at the conversation at the Carnegie Endowment in the US, he called Hamas' attack on Israel a "terrorist attack," and added that Israel had a need to respond and added that India believes that any response by any country has to take into account international humanitarian law.</p>

<p>Asked about the escalating violence in the Middle East and India's approach towards Israel's policy and wider conflict possibilities, Mr Jaishankar said, " If one looks at the current situation, I think it would be right to start off with October 7th. We regard October 7th as a terrorist attack. We understand that Israel had a need to respond, but we also believe that any response by any country has to take into account international humanitarian law, that it must be careful about any damage or any implications for civilian populations. And that given what has happened in Gaza, it is important to have some kind of international humanitarian effort out there."</p>

<p>"And we are very much concerned at the possibility of a broadening of the conflict, not just what happened in Lebanon, but also, you know, I referred earlier to the Houthis and the Red Sea, and, you know, to some extent, everything that happens between Iran and Israel. So again, it's one thing to be concerned. I'm sure you can say that for a lot of countries. If as part of that concern, we can end up doing something about it, you know, then don't underestimate the importance of communication in difficult times. If there are things to be said and passed on and passed back, I think those are all contributions that we can make and we do," he added.</p>

<p>Notably, India has backed a two-state solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict. PM Narendra Modi was one of the first global leaders to condemn the terror attack on Israel by Hamas on October 7.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, India has repeatedly expressed concerns over the deteriorating situation in Gaza.</p>

<p>In October last year, Israel launched a counter-offensive against Hamas after hundreds of Hamas terrorists burst into Israeli borders, killing over 1200 people and taking over 250 hostages, out of which 100 continue to be in captivity.</p>

<p>The war has spiralled into the region lately, with Houthi rebels in Yemen also targeting Israel and other countries in the Red Sea. Israel has also continued striking Hezbollah in Lebanon. As the conflict heads towards escalation, all major countries have called for a ceasefire and hostage deal, while also stressing for a two-state solution as a means to achieve durable and sustainable peace in the region.</p>

<p>In a major escalation in the raging conflict in the Middle East, Iran on Tuesday launched a missile attack on Israel on Tuesday. In a statement, the IDF said all Israeli civilians are in bomb shelters as rockets from Iran are fired at Israel.</p>

<p>Hezbollah is upset that the IDF exposed their plans to massacre Israelis, so they decided to target innocent civilians by firing a barrage of rockets, the IDF further said.</p>

<p>102 missiles have been launched towards Israel, according to the Jerusalem Post. Sirens continue to sound across Israel amid the attack, the Times of Israel reported. According to the IDF, around 10 million civilians are the targets of Iranian projectiles. Iran's state media has also confirmed the Iranian attack towards Israel.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An Australian man has been charged with distributing the encrypted messaging app known as "Ghost", allegedly used by criminals across the globe to arrange drug deals and violence, police said Wednesday.</p>

<p>The Ghost app was marketed to underworld figures as "unhackable" and used by hundreds of suspected criminals from Europe, the Middle East, Australia and Asia.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It was allegedly designed by a 32-year-old Australian computer whiz living with his parents in suburban Sydney.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Australian Federal Police said Wednesday they had arrested a 47-year-old man "alleged to be a distributor" of the app.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Encrypted phones were pre-loaded with Ghost before the man stashed them at "dead drops", or pre-arranged hiding places for collection, police said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Global policing authorities managed to infiltrate the network, watching as criminals discussed illicit drug trafficking, money laundering, homicides and serious violence.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Police swooped in September, arresting criminals from Italy, Ireland, Sweden, Canada and Australia -- including Jay Je Yoon Jung, the alleged "mastermind".&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ghost, a kind of WhatsApp for criminals, was created nine years ago and could only be accessed via modified smartphones that sold for about US $1,590.</p>

<p>French police traced the creator's location to Australia and joined forces with local police to target the platform.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Several thousand people worldwide used Ghost and around 1,000 messages were exchanged on it every day, according to Europol.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There were 376 phones with the Ghost app installed in Australia alone.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iran fired a salvo of ballistic missiles at Israel on Tuesday in retaliation for Israel's campaign against Tehran's Hezbollah allies in Lebanon, drawing on an array of weapons that has long worried the West.</p>

<p>The attack came five months after a strike in April that was the first ever direct Iranian strike on Israel.</p>

<p>Ballistic missiles are an important part of the arsenal at Tehran's disposal. According to the U.S. Office of the Director of National Intelligence, Iran is armed with the largest number of ballistic missiles in the region.</p>

<p>Here are some details:</p>

<p>The semi-official Iranian news outlet ISNA published a graphic in April showing nine Iranian missiles it said could reach Israel. These included the 'Sejil', capable of flying at more than 17,000 km (10,500 miles) per hour and with a range of 2,500 km (1,550 miles), the 'Kheibar' with a range of 2,000 km (1,240 miles), and the 'Haj Qasem', which has a range of 1,400 km (870 miles), ISNA said.</p>

<p>The Arms Control Association, a Washington-based non-governmental organization, says Iran's ballistic missiles include 'Shahab-1', with an estimated range of 300 km (190 miles); the 'Zolfaghar', with 700 km (435 miles); 'Shahab-3', with 800-1,000 km (500 to 620 miles); 'Emad-1', a missile under development with a range up to 2,000 km (1,240 miles) and 'Sejil', under development, with 1,500-2,500 km (930 to 1,550 miles).</p>

<p>Fabian Hinz, a Berlin-based expert on Iran's missile arsenal with the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said that based on the locations of videos of launches posted on social media and the ranges to Israel, he assessed that Iran fired a combination of solid- and liquid-fueled missiles.</p>

<p>The former category of missile, which is more advanced, is fired from angled mobile launchers and the latter from vertical launchers, he said.</p>

<p>He said three solid-propellent missiles fired on Tuesday could be the 'Haj Qasem', 'Kheibar Shekan' and 'Fattah 1'. Liquid propellant missiles reported as being launched from Isfahan might potentially be the 'Emad', 'Badr' and 'Khorramshahr', he said.</p>

<p>Iran says its ballistic missiles are an important deterrent and retaliatory force against the U.S., Israel and other potential regional targets. It denies seeking nuclear weapons. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>According to a 2023 report by Behnam Ben Taleblu, a Senior Fellow at the U.S.-based Foundation for Defense of Democracies, Iran continues to develop underground missile depots complete with transport and firing systems, and subterranean missile production and storage centers. In June 2020, Iran fired its first ever ballistic missile from underground, it said.</p>

<p>"Years of reverse-engineering missiles and producing various missile classes have also taught Iran about stretching airframes and building them with lighter composite materials to increase missile range," the report said.</p>

<p>In June 2023, Iran presented what officials described as its first domestically made hypersonic ballistic missile, the official IRNA news agency reported. Hypersonic missiles can fly at least five times faster than the speed of sound and on a complex trajectory, which makes them difficult to intercept.</p>

<p>The Arms Control Association says Iran's missile programme is largely based on North Korean and Russian designs and has benefited from Chinese assistance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Iran also has cruise missiles such as Kh-55, an air-launched nuclear-capable weapon with a range up to 3,000 km (1,860 miles), and the advanced anti-ship missile the Khalid Farzh, with about 300 km (186 miles), capable of carrying a 1,000-kg (1.1-ton) warhead.</p>

<p><strong>Regional Attacks</strong></p>

<p>Iran's Revolutionary Guards used missiles in January 2024 when they said they attacked the spy headquarters of Israel in Iraq's semi-autonomous Kurdistan region, and said they fired at Islamic State militants in Syria. Iran also announced firing missiles at two bases of a Baluchi militant group in neighbouring Pakistan. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Saudi Arabia and the U.S. have said they believe Iran was behind a drone and missile attack on Saudi Arabia's prized oil facilities in 2019. Tehran denied the allegation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In 2020, Iran launched missile attacks on U.S.-led forces in Iraq, including the al-Asad air base, in retaliation for a U.S. drone strike on an Iranian commander.</p>

<p><strong>Backing For Yemen's Houthis</strong></p>

<p>The United States accuses Iran of arming the Houthis of Yemen, who have been firing on Red Sea shipping and Israel itself during the Gaza war, in a campaign they say is aimed at supporting the Palestinians. Tehran denies arming the Houthis.</p>

<p>On Sept. 24, Reuters reported Iran had brokered secret talks between Russia and the Houthis to transfer anti-ship missiles to the armed group, citing Western and regional sources.</p>

<p>In 2022, the Houthis said they fired ballistic missiles and drones at the United Arab Emirates. This included a missile attack targeting a base hosting the U.S. military in the UAE, which was thwarted by U.S.-built Patriot interceptor missiles.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Support For Hezbollah</strong></p>

<p>Lebanon's Iran-backed Hezbollah group has said it has the ability within Lebanon to convert thousands of rockets into precision missiles and to produce drones. Last year, the late Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah said the group was able to transform standard rockets into precision missiles with the cooperation of Iranian experts.</p>

<p><strong>Syria</strong></p>

<p>Iran has transferred indigenous precision-guided missiles to Syria to support President Bashar al-Assad's fight against rebels, according to Israeli and Western intelligence officials.</p>

<p>It has moved some production capacity to underground compounds in Syria, where Assad's military and other pro-Tehran forces have learned to build their own missiles, those sources say.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The much-anticipated annular solar eclipse is set to grace the skies on October 2. The eclipse will begin at 9:13 pm IST on October 2 and conclude at 3:17 pm IST the next day. During this time, the Moon will appear smaller than the Sun, creating a brilliant <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/feature/ring-of-fire-solar-eclipse-2024-check-timing-visibility-in-india-and-other-details-6671693 ">“ring of fire”</a> effect – a halo of sunlight visible around the darkened centre.</p>

<p><strong>How fast the eclipse will travel</strong></p>

<p>During the upcoming annular solar eclipse, the speed of the Moon's shadow across Earth will vary significantly depending on location. In some areas, it will travel faster than 10 million kmph, while in others, it will slow to about 2,057 kmph, roughly the speed of a fighter jet, reported <a href="https://www.space.com/how-fast-will-the-annular-solar-eclipse-october-2-travel ">Space.com</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Path of the eclipse</strong></p>

<p>The Moon's shadow will move from northwest to southeast, and due to Earth's curvature and the Moon's changing distance and orbital speed, the shadow's velocity will fluctuate dramatically across different regions. The eclipse will start with an eclipsed sunrise, peak at midday and end with an eclipsed sunset.</p>

<p><strong>Where the eclipse will touch and leave Earth</strong></p>

<p>The Moon's shadow will first strike south of Hawaii in the Pacific Ocean, moving at 8.55 million kmph. When it leaves Earth near the island of South Georgia, it will travel at 10 million km/h. However, these extreme speeds occur as the shadow touches and leaves Earth, rendering them less meaningful.</p>

<p><strong>Where can you view the eclipse?</strong></p>

<p>The shadow's speed will be slower when the eclipse is visible at the horizon, around 8,258 kmph at sunrise and 14,312 kmph at sunset. The slowest speed of 2,057 kmph will be observed in the Pacific Ocean northwest of Easter Island, where the ‘ring of fire' will last for 7 minutes and 25 seconds. This slower speed is due to the Moon's shadow being nearly perpendicular to Earth at local midday – the longest duration of the eclipse.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iran's missile offensive against Israel was a "terrible mistake" and Tel Aviv has its greatest opportunity in 50 years to change the face of the Middle East, former Israel Prime Minister Naftali Bennett has said.&nbsp;In a post on X after Tehran fired 108 ballistic missiles targeting Israel last night, the former Prime Minister said Israel must act now and destroy Iran's nuclear programme and energy facilities.</p>

<p>"Israel has now its greatest opportunity in 50 years, to change the face of the Middle East. The leadership of Iran, which used to be good at chess, made a terrible mistake this evening. We must act *now* to destroy Iran's nuclear program, its central energy facilities, and to fatally cripple this terrorist regime," Mr Bennett wrote.</p>

<p>A former commando in Israel's elite Sayeret Matkal unit, Mr Bennett leads the New Right party and served as Prime Minister from June 2021 to June 2022. He succeeded Benjamin Netanyahu after he was ousted as Prime Minister in 2021.</p>

— Naftali Bennett נפתלי בנט (@naftalibennett) <a href="https://twitter.com/naftalibennett/status/1841222685638177225?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 1, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p>Mr Bennett described Iran as the head of the octopus of terror. "To strike the head of the octopus of terror, that, in its cowardice, sent its tentacles (Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis, etc.) to murder us, while the Ayatollahs sat safely in their palaces in Tehran. The octopus's tentacles are temporarily paralysed - now comes the head. We must remove this terrible threat to our children's future," he said in the post. "We can grant the Iranian people an opportunity to rise up and shake off the regime that tyrannizes its women and daughters," the former Prime Minister added.</p>

<p>Iran's missile offensive against Israel followed the killing of Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah and Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Israeli military operations. While Tel Aviv's advanced defence systems intercepted many of the missiles launched by Tehran, many others landed. There have been no casualties in Israel though.</p>

<p>The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps said the attack was "in accordance with the United Nations Charter" and followed "a period of restraint" following an "attack on the sovereignty" of Iran -- a reference to the killing of Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran in late July. The IRGC said the missiles targeted "three military bases" around Tel Aviv as well as air and radar bases.</p>

<p>Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said Iran made a "big mistake" and warned that it "will pay for it".</p>

<p>In his post on X, Mr Bennett said, "We have the justification. We have the tools. Now that Hezbollah and Hamas are paralyzed, Iran stands exposed. Over this last terrible year, Iranian tentacles murdered our families. Raped our daughters. Kidnapped our children. Ransacked our towns. Burned our fields. Fired on our ships. Terrorized children in Kiryat Shmona, Kfar Aza, and Sderot. Emptied out whole regions of our land. Humiliated us."</p>

<p>"Now is the moment. A Nation of Lions has united and proven its strength over the last year. It has yearned for a change, for action, for so very long. There are times when history knocks at our door, and we must open it. This opportunity must not be missed," the former Prime Minister added.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Playing a monotonous sound stimulates the activity of a fungus that promotes plant growth, a study suggested on Wednesday, raising the potential that playing music could be good for crops and gardens.</p>

<p>Whether or not blasting Mozart could help plants grow has long been a matter of scientific debate. The US TV show "MythBusters" even tested it out, finding that plants exposed to death metal and classical music grew a little better than those left in silence, but deeming the results inconclusive.</p>

<p>However, with the plant world facing a raft of human-driven challenges -- including erosion, deforestation, pollution and a burgeoning extinction crisis -- the future of the world's biodiversity and crops are increasingly feared to be under threat.</p>

<p>According to a new study in the journal Biology Letters, "the role of acoustic stimulation in fostering ecosystem recovery and sustainable food systems remains under-explored".</p>

<p>Based on previous work that exposed E. coli bacteria to sound waves, the team of Australian researchers set out to assess the effect sound has on the growth rate and spore production of the fungus Trichoderma harzianum.</p>

<p>This fungus is often used in organic farming for its ability to protect plants from pathogens, improve nutrients in the soil and promote growth.</p>

<p>The researchers built little sound booths to house Petri dishes full of fungi.</p>

<p>Instead of pop bangers, they were played "Tinnitus Flosser Masker at 8 kHz". This was the audio from one of many white noise videos on YouTube which are intended to relieve tinnitus or help babies fall asleep.</p>

<p>"Think of the sound of an old-school radio in between channels," lead study author Jake Robinson of Flinders University told AFP.</p>

<p>"We chose this monotone for controlled, experimental reasons, but it might be that a more diverse or natural soundscape is better," he said.</p>

<p>"This needs further research."</p>

<h3><strong>Sound garden&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>The petri dishes were played with this sound at a level of 80 decibels for half an hour a day.</p>

<p>After five days, the growth and spore production were higher in the fungi that were played the sound, compared to those that sat in silence.</p>

<p>While far from definitive, the researchers suggested some potential reasons this could happen.</p>

<p>The acoustic wave could be converted into a fungi-stimulating electrical charge under what is known as the piezoelectric effect.</p>

<p>Another theory involves tiny receptors on the membranes of the fungi called mechanoreceptors.</p>

<p>These are comparable to the thousands of mechanoreceptors on human skin that play a role in our sense of touch -- which involves reacting to pressure or vibration.</p>

<p>"It might be that sound waves stimulate these mechanoreceptors in the fungi, which then trigger a cascade of biochemical events that lead to genes being switched on or off -- for instance, the kind of genes responsible for growth," Robinson said.</p>

<p>"Our preliminary research suggests the fungi respond to the sound, but we don't know yet if this benefits the plants. So, this is the next step," he added.</p>

<p>"Can we influence soil or plant microbial communities as a whole? Can we speed up the soil restoration process by stimulating the earth with natural soundscapes? What impact might this have on the soil fauna?" he asked.</p>

<p>"There are many important questions to keep us busy."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential candidate, said on Tuesday that Iran was a "dangerous" and "destabilizing" force in the Middle East and Washington was committed to Israel's security.</p>

<h2><strong>Why It's Important</strong></h2>

<p>The comments from Harris, who faces Republican former President Donald Trump in the November 5 US election, came hours after Iran fired ballistic missiles at Israel in retaliation for Israel's military campaign in Lebanon, drawing vows of a sharp response from Israel and the US.</p>

<p>No injuries were reported in Israel and Washington called Iran's attack ineffective.</p>

<h2><strong>Key Quotes</strong></h2>

<p>"I'm clear-eyed Iran is a destabilizing, dangerous force in the Middle East," Harris said. "I will always ensure Israel has the ability to defend itself against Iran and Iran-backed terrorist militias."</p>

<p>"I fully support President (Joe) Biden's order for the U.S. military to shoot down Iranian missiles targeting Israel," Harris said. "Initial indications are that Israel, with our assistance, was able to defeat this attack."</p>

<p>Harris added that Washington will work with its allies to disrupt what she called Iran's "aggressive behavior."</p>

<h2><strong>Context</strong></h2>

<p>Israel has escalated its military campaign in Lebanon in recent days, killing hundreds and displacing more than a million due to operations that Israel says are targeting Lebanese Iran-backed Hezbollah operatives.</p>

<p>Israel's military campaign in Lebanon is in addition to its war in Gaza that followed a deadly October 7 attack on Israel by Palestinian Hamas operatives. Israeli's military assault on Gaza has killed tens of thousands according to Palestinian health authorities, displaced nearly everyone there, caused a hunger crisis and prompted genocide allegations that Israel denies.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iran on Tuesday fired 200 missiles, including hypersonic weapons, at Israel as tensions in the Middle East reach breaking point. Israel has vowed that Iran <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/israel-iran-lebanon-hezbollah-after-irans-missile-attack-on-israel-us-severe-consequences-warning-6696958">will "pay" for the attack</a>. But relations between the two countries were not always sour. Unthinkable as it may sound, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/iran-missile-strike-israel-video-massive-crater-near-mossad-hq-after-irans-big-missile-offensive-6697549#pfrom=home-ndtv_topscroll">Israel and Iran</a> had collaborated, with help from the United States, to fight a common enemy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the 1960s, both Israel and Iran found a mutual adversary in Iraq. While <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/israel-hezbollah-lebanon-as-israel-begins-ground-invasion-of-lebanon-lessons-from-1982-2006-wars-6690081">Israel</a> was locked in a broader struggle against hostile Arab regimes, Iran, under the Shah, viewed Iraq's leadership as a direct threat to its security and regional ambitions. This laid the groundwork for one of the most secretive partnerships of the era, involving the Mossad - Israel's intelligence agency - and SAVAK - Iran's secret police - both of which played key roles in bolstering Kurdish insurgents against the central Iraqi regime. These Kurdish groups, seen as the Achilles' heel of Iraq's Arab nationalist leadership, were crucial to undermining the Iraqi government from within.</p>

<p>The cooperation between Israel and Iran reached new heights with the formation of a trilateral intelligence alliance code-named Trident, which also included Turkey. Beginning in 1958, Trident saw these three non-Arab powers exchange critical intelligence and engage in joint counterintelligence operations. As the relationship matured, Israel and Iran became even closer, forming deep military and intelligence ties that extended well into the Shah's reign.</p>

<h2><strong>The Shah's Ambitions And Israel's Influence</strong></h2>

<p>The Shah of Iran, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, was driven not only by shared geopolitical interests but by a belief in Israel's influence in Washington. The Shah saw Israel as a potential means for enhancing relations with the United States, especially after the Kennedy administration voiced concerns about his authoritarian rule.</p>

<p>The burgeoning Israeli-Iranian relationship became a key feature of Iran's strategy to align itself with the West, resulting in the establishment of a permanent Israeli delegation in Tehran by the mid-1960s, which functioned as a de facto embassy.</p>

</div>

<p>However, the relationship was not without complications. The Shah, aware of the widespread anti-Israeli sentiment across the Arab world, carefully managed the public face of Iran's relationship with Israel. While he became more critical of Israel after the 1967 Six-Day War, his strategic interests continued to outweigh ideological or diplomatic positions.</p>

<h2><strong>Cooperation In The Shadows</strong></h2>

<p>The 1979 Islamic Revolution in Iran drastically changed the country's political landscape, transforming it into an anti-Israel Islamic Republic. Yet, even after Ayatollah Khomeini's rise to power, the new regime found itself quietly collaborating with Israel, driven once again by common enemies. As the Iran-Iraq War (1980-1988) dragged on, both countries recognised the advantage of working together against Saddam Hussein's Iraq.</p>

<p>Israel, too, saw an opportunity in aiding Iran. In particular, it viewed Saddam Hussein's Iraq as a more immediate and dangerous threat to its security, given Baghdad's ambitions for regional dominance and its pursuit of nuclear capabilities. Iraq's formidable military, supplied by both the United States and the Soviet Union, posed a risk, and Israel's shipment of arms to Iran - particularly after Prime Minister Menachem Begin approved the sale of military equipment in 1980 - was a calculated decision to undermine Iraq's strength.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="sraeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin (L) chats to Egyptian President Anwar al-Sadat at his home where the ministers discussed events in Iran in 1979." id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-10/bkf3719g_menachem-begin-anwar-al-sadat-getty_625x300_02_October_24.jpg" title="sraeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin (L) chats to Egyptian President Anwar al-Sadat at his home where the ministers discussed events in Iran in 1979." /></div>

<p>These covert arms deals were conducted despite US policy that barred military support for Iran until the release of American hostages held in Tehran. In exchange for Israeli military aid, Khomeini's regime allowed a significant number of Iranian Jews to emigrate to Israel or the United States, a concession that underscored the pragmatic nature of the relationship.</p>

<h2><strong>The Iran-Contra Affair</strong></h2>

<p>By the mid-1980s, Iran's need for military support reached a critical point. The Iran-Iraq War had drained the country's resources, and its economy was teetering on the brink of collapse. It was against this backdrop that the Iran-Contra affair unfolded - a secretive, high-stakes operation involving arms sales facilitated by Israel, with the backing of senior Ronald Reagan administration officials, to secure the release of American hostages held by Iran-sponsored Hezbollah in Lebanon.</p>

</div>

<p>For Israel, these arms deals were lucrative and strategically valuable, further enhancing its role as a clandestine ally of Iran in its war against Iraq. Iran, desperate for arms and resources, was willing to engage with both Israel and the United States, even as it continued to publicly vilify Israel.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>The Secret Missile Project: Operation Flower</strong></h2>

<p>The Israeli-Iranian partnership extended beyond conventional arms deals. One of the most ambitious projects was Operation Flower, a secret multibillion-dollar initiative that began in 1977 under the Shah's regime. The project involved the modification of surface-to-surface missiles, potentially capable of being fitted with nuclear warheads, for sale to Iran. However, the nuclear aspect of the project was not pursued.</p>

<p>As part of the deal, Iran made a substantial down payment in 1978 by sending $260 million worth of oil to Israel, a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nytimes.com/1986/04/01/world/documents-detail-israeli-missile-deal-with-the-shah.html" name="no outbound">New York Times report</a> from 1986 claimed. Work on the missile program continued until the Islamic Revolution in 1979, after which Khomeini's regime abruptly halted the collaboration.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Spare Tyres For F-4 Fighter Jets</strong></h2>

<p>Israel covertly supplied Iran with 250 spare tyres for American-made F-4 fighter jets in October 1980, as Iran waged war against Iraq, according to a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nytimes.com/1981/08/22/world/israel-is-said-to-have-sold-iran-f-4-tires.html" name="no outbound">New York Times report</a> from 1981.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After Saddam Hussein's invasion of Iran in September 1980, Israel found itself in an unusual position. The Israeli sale of 250 retreaded tires, valued at around $300,000, was a secretive transaction aimed at bolstering Iran's air force. The F-4 Phantom jets, a key component of Iran's military, had been grounded due to wear and tear. With no immediate access to parts due to the embargo placed by the US on Iran, Israel stepped in to fill the gap. According to the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/22/world/isreael-aide-traces-us-iran-dealings.html" name="no outbound">New York Times</a>, retreaded tyres were produced in Israel and then covertly transported to France, where they were flown to Iran on chartered planes.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="The Shah of Iran, in St. Louis to discuss buying F-4 Phantom jets built by McDonnel Douglas aircraft company." id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-10/ndgove7o_iran-shah-f4-jets-getty-_625x300_02_October_24.jpg" title="The Shah of Iran, in St. Louis to discuss buying F-4 Phantom jets built by McDonnel Douglas aircraft company." /></div>

</div>

<p>The transaction occurred during a delicate period for US-Iran relations, with 52 American diplomats still held hostage in Tehran. The Jimmy Carter administration, keen to secure their release, urged Israel to suspend further military deals with Iran until the hostages were freed. According to officials involved, Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin agreed to American pressure and paused all military dealings, despite Israeli strategic interests in preventing an Iraqi victory in the war.</p>

<p>Beyond regional power politics, Israel had a more personal concern: the fate of the Jewish population in Iran. At the time, approximately 60,000 Jews lived in Iran, and there were growing fears in Israel that they could become targets of repression or persecution under the new regime. Maintaining some form of back-channel communication with Iran was seen as a way to protect these Jewish communities.</p>

<h2><strong>Hostility And Rivalry&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p>By the 1990s, the era of cooperation between Israel and Iran had all but evaporated. The geopolitical factors that had once united them -Arab socialism, Soviet influence, and the threat of Iraq - had disappeared, leaving little incentive for continued collaboration. Iran, now firmly under the control of its revolutionary government, embraced an anti-Israel ideology, supporting groups like Hezbollah and Hamas in their conflicts with the Jewish state.</p>

<p>By the early 2000s, the election of Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, whose Holocaust denial and aggressive rhetoric against Israel stoked tensions further, cemented Iran as Israel's most prominent adversary in the region. As Israel fought wars with Hezbollah in 2006 and Hamas in 2008, Iranian support for these non-state actors - collectively termed the '<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/israel-hamas-palestine-gaza-explained-axis-of-resistance-and-irans-proxy-network-across-middle-east-4534061">Axis Of Resistance</a>' - became a central concern in Israel's strategic calculations.</p>

<h2><strong>2024 And Threat Of All-Out War</strong></h2>

<p>Ties between Iran and Israel are now non-existent. The two Middle Eastern countries are now on the brink of all-out war, evidenced by Israel's multi-frontal conflict against Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon and Houthis in Yemen. All three of these armed militant groups are part of Iran's 'Axis Of Resistance'.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US vice-presidential debates traditionally have little effect on the White House race, but with Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Kamala Harris neck-and-neck, the stakes were higher than usual in New York on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Trump's running mate JD Vance and Harris's VP pick Tim Walz both scored points in what is expected to be their only <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-elections-2024-us-veep-candidates-take-on-middle-east-crisis-in-pre-election-debate-6696960">showdown</a>, although the primary goal was always to avoid harming their running mates' chances.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Here are five takeaways from the debate.</p>

<h3><strong>New faces</strong></h3>

<p>Walz, who was virtually unknown on the national stage before the summer, had set expectations low -- comparing Vance's academic record as a "Yale law guy" and is own humble status as a "public school teacher."&nbsp;</p>

<p>He had a shaky start but improved as he relaxed into the conversation. Famously affable, Walz tried to weave in the occasional folksy anecdote but he often came across as defensive, dropping his trademark Midwestern charm.</p>

<p>Vance, who is known for his rhetorical prowess, was under pressure to make up for Trump's dismal debate performance last month, when he was soundly beaten by Harris.</p>

<p>Trump had missed chances to attack Harris on immigration and inflation -- failing to frame her as an incumbent -- but Vance was able to score points where his boss failed.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/tim-walz-jd-vance-shake-hands-before-us-vice-presidential-debate-starts-6696928">Both candidates</a> tackled policy specifics -- the Middle East, climate change, the economy or the fentanyl crisis -- which made for a more wonkish debate than the Trump-Harris showdown.</p>

<h3><strong>Awkward&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Walz was forced to explain claims that he was in Hong Kong for a teaching position in 1989 during the deadly Tiananmen Square pro-democracy protests.</p>

<p>"I got there that summer and misspoke on this," the governor said calling himself a "knucklehead" who "will get caught up in the rhetoric."</p>

<p>Vance, who labelled Trump as "unfit for our nation's highest office" before becoming a supporter and once said Trump "could be America's Hitler" -- was challenged on his remarks.</p>

<p>He said he had been deceived by false stories in the media and was wrong.</p>

<h3><strong>A proxy battle&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>The real contest was between Harris and Trump, with their two stand-ins focusing their sharpest attacks on the top-of-the-ticket contest.</p>

<p>The Minnesota governor went after Trump for ignoring the advice of scientists and economists.</p>

<p>"If you're going to be president, you don't have all the answers. Donald Trump believes he does," he said.</p>

<p>He attacked Trump for bragging about avoiding taxes, and for urging Republicans to vote against a tough bipartisan border security bill.</p>

<p>Vance tore into Harris on <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/why-the-vance-walz-debate-boils-down-to-contrasting-versions-of-masculinity-6683266">immigration</a> and accused her of driving up prices, particularly housing costs, by allowing millions of migrants into the country.</p>

<h3><strong>Fact checks, mic cuts&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Debate fact-checking has made for an unusual controversy during this election cycle.</p>

<p>CBS said it would decline to debunk whoppers live on air but instead directed viewers to a blog offering real-time fact-checking.</p>

<p>There were a couple of on-air fact-checks of Vance -- including one on man-made climate change and another on the legal status of some migrants.</p>

<p>This infuriated Vance, who began pushing back. The candidates' mics were both muted briefly as they launched into a rare heated back-and-forth.</p>

<h3><strong>A gentler tone&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>But, without the bombastic ex-president, proceedings largely resembled election debates that used to take place before the Trump era: policy-focused, lacking personal attacks and cloaked in apparent civility.</p>

<p>There was even a tender, human moment when Walz related a shocking story about his 17-year-old son Gus witnessing a shooting in a community centre.</p>

<p>Vance made a point of turning to Walz to sympathize with him.</p>

<p>The candidates brought up their families on more than one occasion, with Vance talking about his "three beautiful little kids."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Walz and Vance shook hands at the start, and again end of the debate as their wives joined them on stage.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the 180-odd ballistic missiles Iran fired last night landed near the Tel Aviv headquarters of Israeli intelligence service Mossad. A video that has emerged on social media shows a massive crater near the Mossad headquarters after Tehran's missile offensive.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://edition.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-lebanon-war-hezbollah-10-1-24-intl-hnk/index.html">CNN geolocated the video</a> and found it was shot from a high-rise apartment building in Herzliya, less than 3 kilometers from Mossad headquarters.</p>

<p>The video shows the huge crater in what appears to be a parking lot. The missile strike threw up dust and several vehicles parked nearby were covered in soil. This crater is a few hundred metres away from a cinema complex.</p>

<p>Air raid sirens rang through Israeli cities and about 10 million rushed to take refuge in bomb shelters last when after Iran launched a barrage of missiles.</p>

<p>The Israel Defense Forces have said most of the missiles were intercepted by the country's advanced defence systems Iron Dome and Arrow. But some penetrated the shield, leading to minor damage.</p>

<p>The missile offensive was in retaliation to the killing of Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah and Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Israeli military strikes.</p>

<p>Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said Iran made a "big mistake" and warned that it "will pay for it".</p>

<p>Guy Nir, spokesperson for the Israeli embassy in India, told NDTV that Tehran would get an appropriate response. "If he (Iran leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei) plans to initiate a full-scale war with Israel, it will be a mistake for them (Iran). Israel's response is going to be strategic and pin-pointed, and not a full-scale war. I don't think any side wants that."</p>

<p>Iran's Ambassador to India Iraj Elahi has warned that Tehran will strike Israel again if it doesn't de-escalate tensions. "If the Hitler of our time (Netanyahu) stops his brutality and hostility, his country won't have to face the consequences," Mr Elahi told NDTV.</p>

<p>Israel's all-weather ally US has warned Iran, saying that the missile strike marked a "significant escalation". National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan pledged that the US would stand by Israel and support any retaliatory measures.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Texas man was put to death by lethal injection on Tuesday evening for the murders of teenage twin sisters, prison officials said, the sixth death row inmate to be executed in the United States in the past 12 days.</p>

<p>Before he was put to death in the state penitentiary in the city of Huntsville, Garcia White, 61, apologized to his victims' family. He was pronounced dead at 6:56 pm local time.</p>

<p>A former high school football star, White was convicted in 1996 of stabbing Annette and Bernette Edwards to death in December 1989.</p>

<p>According to court and prison records, White killed the mother, Bonita Edwards, of the 16-year-old girls following an argument at their Houston home and then murdered the two sisters.</p>

<p>White was not tried for the death of Bonita Edwards or for two other murders he confessed to committing, one in 1989 and another in 1995.</p>

<p>White's lawyers had filed a last-minute request for a stay of execution with the US Supreme Court, arguing that he was intellectually disabled and therefore not eligible for the death penalty.</p>

<p>"I would like to apologize for all the wrong I have done, and for pain I've caused to the Edwards family," White said before the execution, the Texas Department of Criminal Justice said in a statement. "I regret, I apologize, and I pray that you can find peace."</p>

<p>Texas has carried out four executions this year at the state penitentiary in Huntsville and another inmate, Robert Roberson, 57, is scheduled to be put to death on October 17, despite questions about his guilt.</p>

<p>Lawmakers in Texas, medical experts and the best-selling novelist John Grisham are among those seeking to halt the execution of Roberson, who was convicted of the 2002 death of his two-year-old daughter Nikki.</p>

<p>Roberson, who is autistic, took the girl to a hospital with severe head trauma and the child died the next day.</p>

<p>Roberson's lawyers and advocates have argued that the diagnosis of shaken baby syndrome, made at the hospital where the child died, was erroneous.</p>

<p>In a letter to Texas officials, 34 doctors said the cause of death was in fact severe pneumonia, aggravated by the little girl being prescribed the wrong medication.</p>

<p>Roberson's autism, which was not diagnosed until 2018, was misconstrued at the time as showing indifference to the death of the toddler and this perception weighed heavily in his conviction, according to his lawyers.</p>

<p>Four executions were carried out in the United States last week and one the week before, bringing the total this year to 18.</p>

<p>The death penalty has been abolished in 23 of the 50 US states, while six others -- Arizona, California, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania and Tennessee -- have moratoriums in place.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Brazilian judge on Tuesday ordered the unblocking of the bank accounts of Elon Musk's X in the country after the social media platform agreed to pay more than $5 million in fines. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The ruling by Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes paves the way for the suspension of X to be lifted in Brazil, where it has been off-limits to users since August 31 in a standoff over disinformation between the judge and Musk.</p>

<p>Moraes ordered X shut down in Latin America's biggest country after Musk refused to remove dozens of right-wing accounts and then failed to name a new legal representative in the country as ordered. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>In his latest decision, the judge ordered Brazil's central bank to unblock X's bank accounts so it can receive transfers and "immediately make payment of the fines indicated."&nbsp;</p>

<p>X had informed the court it would pay fines to the tune of some $5.2 million, according to the ruling.&nbsp;</p>

<p>High-profile judge Moraes has been engaged in a long feud with Tesla and SpaceX owner Musk as part of his drive to crack down on disinformation in Brazil. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The clash between the Brazilian court and the billionaire has morphed into a high-stakes tussle testing the limits of both freedom of expression and corporate responsibility in South America's largest country.&nbsp;</p>

<p>X had more than 22 million users in Brazil before the ban, which was put into place on August 31. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The company has in the last week started complying with the Brazilian court's conditions to get reactivated.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Musk has repeatedly hit out at Moraes in social media posts, calling him an "evil dictator" and dubbing him "Voldemort" after the villain from the "Harry Potter" series. &nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US Vice President Kamala Harris and former president Donald Trump are hurtling toward their November election showdown, one of the closest contests in modern American history.</p>

<p>And in the handful of critical states framing the 2024 race, there is little daylight between the rivals with barely a month before Election Day on November 5.</p>

<p>Under the US Constitution, America's founding fathers established that each of the 50 states would hold its own vote for president.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Then, under the complex Electoral College system, each state has a certain number of "electors," based on population. Most states have a winner-take-all system that awards all electors to whoever wins the popular vote.</p>

<p>With candidates needing 270 of the 538 electors to win, elections tend to be decided in the hotly contested "swing states" with a history of alternating between Republican and Democratic candidates.</p>

<p>This year, there are seven such battlegrounds, and virtually everyone is a toss-up. Here is a look:</p>

<h3><strong>Pennsylvania (19 Electoral College votes)</strong></h3>

<p>Pennsylvania was once reliably Democratic, but these days, they don't come much tighter than the Keystone State.</p>

<p>Republican Trump won the most populous battleground, with 13 million residents, by 0.7 percentage points in 2016. Joe Biden claimed it by 1.2 percentage points in 2020.</p>

<p>Known for its "Rust Belt" cities like Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania has been blighted for decades by the steady decline of its industrial manufacturing base.</p>

<p>Trump and Harris have campaigned repeatedly in the eastern state. Trump, who survived an assassination attempt at a July rally there, is courting the rural white population and warning that migrants are overwhelming small towns.</p>

<p>Harris is touting recent infrastructure wins, and in Pittsburgh, she outlined plans to invest $100 billion in manufacturing, a key issue for state residents.</p>

<h3><strong>Georgia (16)</strong></h3>

<p>This southeastern state was an election flashpoint at the end of Trump's first term, and the controversy simmers.</p>

<p>Prosecutors in Georgia indicted Trump in an election interference case after he called state officials urging them to "find" enough votes to overturn Biden's narrow 2020 victory.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But in a boost for Trump, the case is paused until after the election.</p>

<p>Biden was the first Democrat to win the Peach State since 1992. Demographic changes are likely to benefit Harris, who has courted minority voters across Georgia.</p>

<h3><strong>North Carolina (16)&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>The southeastern state has voted Democratic only once since 1980, but Harris believes it's back in play.</p>

<p>The population, now over 10 million, is expanding and growing more diverse, benefiting Democrats.</p>

<p>Complicating matters for Trump, a scandal involving the state's Republican gubernatorial candidate has infuriated party officials who worry it could sink Trump in a close race.</p>

<p>As in neighbouring Georgia, one wild card is how the devastation from storm Helene, which recently laid waste to towns in western North Carolina, might impact the vote.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Michigan (15)</strong></h3>

<p>Trump flipped Michigan, a former Democratic stronghold, on his way to defeating Hillary Clinton in 2016.</p>

<p>Biden returned it to the blue column in 2020, buoyed by unionized workers and a large Black community.</p>

<p>But this time, Harris risks losing the support of a 200,000-strong Arab-American community that has denounced Biden's -- and by extension her -- handling of the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.</p>

<h3><strong>Arizona (11)</strong></h3>

<p>The Grand Canyon state was among 2020's tightest races, with Biden triumphing by just 10,457 votes.</p>

<p>Trump hopes frustrations over the Biden-Harris administration's immigration policy will swing Arizona, which shares a border with Mexico, back in his favour.</p>

<p>Harris visited Arizona's border last week vowing to crack down on migration and work on reviving last year's bipartisan border bill, which she said Trump "tanked" for political purposes.</p>

<p>Of the battlegrounds, Arizona is showing the largest poll advantage: Trump up by two percentage points.</p>

<h3><strong>Wisconsin (10)</strong></h3>

<p>Clinton lost Wisconsin after giving the state a wide berth during the 2016 campaign.</p>

<p>As with Midwestern neighbour Michigan, it was a different story when Trump's opponent was Biden, who turned a 23,000-vote deficit into a winning margin of 21,000 for Democrats.</p>

<p>Trump considers it winnable, and his party held its summer national convention there.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While Trump led early against Biden, Harris has a tiny polling edge.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The two candidates for US president offer starkly different visions of the world, with November's election carrying the potential to dramatically change policy toward Ukraine and other partners.</p>

<p>Vice President Kamala Harris largely offers continuity with President Joe Biden, though she has sought more nuance on the Middle East in particular, while a return of Donald Trump would likely mean a sharp rupture from current US foreign policy.</p>

<h3><strong>Ukraine&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Few issues divide the two candidates as much as Ukraine.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Trump has scoffed at the billions of dollars in US aid to Ukraine, saying that Russia, which invaded its smaller neighbour in February 2022, is destined to win.</p>

<p>The Republican has in the past voiced admiration for Russian strongman Vladimir Putin, comments seized upon by Harris, who in their September debate said, "If Donald Trump were president, Putin would be sitting in Kyiv right now."</p>

<p>Harris has promised to keep up support for Ukraine, while Trump's aides have suggested leveraging US assistance to force Ukraine into territorial concessions to end the war quickly.</p>

<p>Trump has also mocked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky as the "greatest salesman" in a jab at his lobbying for US military aid, although the two recently had a cordial meeting.</p>

<h3><strong>Middle East</strong></h3>

<p>Harris and Trump are both solidly pro-Israel but they diverge on how far to pressure the US ally as war spreads in the Middle East.</p>

<p>Harris, like Biden, has made clear she will keep arming Israel, distancing herself from calls from the left of their Democratic Party for an arms embargo for the sake of sparing civilians.</p>

<p>But Harris has also called for Palestinian "self-determination" and said she will "not be silent" on the suffering in the Gaza Strip.</p>

<p>Trump's Republican base is staunchly pro-Israel and he has repeatedly attacked Biden's record as a failure, including on Tuesday as Iran fired missiles in response to Israel's killings of top Hezbollah militants and Iranian commanders in Lebanon.</p>

<p>Trump as president took a series of landmark actions on Israel's behalf, including moving the US embassy to flash point Jerusalem and giving Arab nations incentives to recognize Israel.</p>

<p>But he also has a complicated history with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whom he criticized for joining other world leaders in recognizing that Biden won the 2020 US election -- an outcome that Trump refused to accept despite overwhelming evidence.</p>

<h3><strong>China and Taiwan&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Policymakers of both US political parties have spoken of China as the top long-term challenger, though they differ on rhetoric and approach.</p>

<p>Trump has relentlessly attacked China in his stump speeches and has vowed to impose massive tariffs on Chinese goods, hoping to boost manufacturing at home. But despite his public statements, he has also indicated he is open to deal-making with President Xi Jinping.</p>

<p>Biden has in some ways gone further than Trump, including by imposing a sweeping ban on high-tech chip exports.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Harris has highlighted Trump's reluctance while he was in office to take similar measures, charging that he "basically sold us out," with China's military benefiting from US technology.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in Taiwan, the self-ruling democracy claimed by Beijing, Trump has caused jitters by suggesting that it pay for its defence, likening the United States to an insurance company.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Harris, as vice president, has pledged to maintain the status quo, stating that "we support Taiwan's self-defence, consistent with our longstanding policy."</p>

<h3><strong>US allies&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>In a sharp break from previous presidents of both parties, Trump has questioned the utility of NATO, the collective defence alliance formed at the start of the Cold War.</p>

<p>Trump even said in February he would encourage the Russians to do "whatever the hell they want" to NATO allies that do not pay more on defence.</p>

<p>Harris has frequently pointed to Trump's remarks as she promises, like Biden, to work with allies and stand by NATO.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Trump in his first term showed he was ready to break with international agreements he does not like, including the Iran nuclear deal.</p>

<p>He would also be expected to champion tough US pressure against leftist leaders in Latin America, particularly Cuba and Venezuela, although neither Biden nor Harris has deviated sharply from his approach.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US vice presidential contenders JD Vance and Tim Walz took on the crisis in the Middle East as they met Tuesday for what could be an unusually important undercard debate, competing for decisive votes weeks before the election.</p>

<p>The <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/tim-walz-jd-vance-shake-hands-before-us-vice-presidential-debate-starts-6696928">showdown</a> between Walz, the Democratic Minnesota governor chosen by Kamala Harris, and Vance, the Republican senator from Ohio who is Donald Trump's running mate, is likely to be the last of the 2024 campaign.</p>

<p>Trump has refused a second debate with Vice President Harris, meaning this could be the final chance to see the two tickets go head to head.</p>

<p>The first question of the night was on Iran's missile attack on Israel and Walz immediately turned his fire on Trump's foreign policy record, slamming the ex-president for his "turn towards" Russia's Vladimir Putin" and his withdrawal of the United States from the 2015 Iran nuclear disarmament deal, known as the JCPOA.</p>

<p>"As much as Governor Walz just accused Donald Trump of being an agent of chaos, Donald Trump actually delivered stability in the world," Vance countered.</p>

<p>"And he did it by establishing effective deterrence. People were afraid of stepping out of line."</p>

<p>Vance, 40, and Walz, 60, each claim to be the true voice of the crucial <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/why-the-vance-walz-debate-boils-down-to-contrasting-versions-of-masculinity-6683266">swing states</a> -- including Michigan and Wisconsin -- that could decide an election that remains on a knife edge with five weeks to go.</p>

<p>History suggests vice-presidential debates rarely move the dial much. But in an election campaign that has seen Harris step in for President Joe Biden unprecedentedly late in the game, Tuesday's contest may have added significance.</p>

<p>Biden offered words of encouragement for Walz, telling him in a post on X ahead of his big night: "Coach, I got your back tonight!"</p>

<p>The race has seen Vance and Trump use increasingly divisive rhetoric and even falsely accuse immigrants of eating people's pets -- meaning the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/the-vance-walz-us-vice-presidential-debate-all-you-need-to-know-6672924">debate</a> could make for fiery television.</p>

<p>"It will whet a lot of people's appetites for November 5," Thomas Whalen, an associate professor of social sciences at Boston University, told AFP.</p>

<p>But the debate itself risked being overshadowed by Mideast tensions, after Iran launched ballistic missiles against Israel, which said it largely repelled the attack.</p>

<p>Trump, visiting swing state Wisconsin on Tuesday, focused on the crisis, insisting that "if I were in charge, today's attack on Israel never would have happened."</p>

<p>Should Harris and Walz win, he warned, "the world goes up in smoke."</p>

<p>Trump told Vance to "have fun" when he was asked what advice he would give, praising his running mate as a "warrior."</p>

<p>Harris for her part pledged her "unwavering" commitment to the security of Israel after Iran launched what she called "a reckless and brazen attack" on America's ally.</p>

<p>The CBS clash comes as several states dig out from enormous storm Helene, which has left at least 150 people dead and brought misery to many thousands more.</p>

<h3><strong>'High drama'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Walz and Vance were each picked by their bosses to reach out to voters in the Midwestern battlegrounds where, thanks to the country's idiosyncratic electoral college system, a few thousand votes could determine who wins the White House race.</p>

<p>Both are military veterans with strong blue-collar credentials. Vance authored the Rust Belt memoir "Hillbilly Elegy" while Walz boasts a folksy persona as a former teacher and football coach.</p>

<p>The similarities end there.</p>

<p>The combative Vance shares Trump's penchant for courting controversy, whether by smearing Democrats as "childless cat ladies" or by boosting false claims that Haitians living in an Ohio town ate residents' pets.</p>

<p>His goal will be to overcome polls that initially had him as one of the least popular VP nominees in history after a series of previous comments on women and abortion were unearthed.</p>

<p>"Vance has to be careful because I think a trap has been laid for him," said Whalen.</p>

<p>The cheery Walz will be seeking to introduce himself to a public that barely knows him, after Harris's swift rise to replace Biden as the Democratic nominee.</p>

<p>He became a hit with Democrats for branding Vance and Trump "weird" and for his progressive politics -- but that will be a target for Vance as he and Trump seek to paint Walz and Harris as "Marxists."</p>

<p>Vance "is going up against a moron, a total moron," Trump said in an interview Monday on Fox Nation.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iran launched a barrage of 181 ballistic missiles at Israel on Tuesday night, triggering nationwide air raid sirens and forcing nearly 10 million Israelis into bomb shelters. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) reported that a large portion of the missiles was intercepted by the country's advanced missile defence systems, including the Iron Dome and Arrow systems. However, several projectiles managed to penetrate the defence shield, leading to minor damage and light injuries.</p>

<h2><strong>Immediate Response</strong></h2>

<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the attack, stating that Iran had made a "big mistake" and warned Tehran that it "will pay for it."</p>

<p>The missile salvo is the second direct attack by Iran on Israel this year, following a similar offensive in April, which was quickly subdued by Israeli and allied defences. Tuesday's strikes, according to Iranian officials, were in retaliation for the recent killing of senior Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Israeli military operations.</p>

<p>Guy Nir, spokesperson of the Israeli embassy in India, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/ndtv-exclusive-will-irans-missile-attack-lead-to-a-full-scale-war-israeli-spokesperson-guy-nir-gives-a-hint-6696110#pfrom=home-ndtv_topscroll">speaking exclusively to NDTV</a>, said an appropriate response will be given to Tehran. "If he (Ayatollah Ali Khamenei) plans to initiate a full-scale war with Israel, it will be a mistake for them (Iran)," Mr Nir told NDTV. "Israel's response is going to be something strategic and pin-pointed, and not a full-scale war. I don't think any side wants that."</p>

<p>Iran's Ambassador to India<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/ndtv-exclusive-iran-ambassador-calls-israel-pm-benjamin-netanyahu-hitler-of-21st-century-says-india-can-help-stop-war-6696604#pfrom=home-ndtv_topscroll"> Iraj Elahi warned that his country will "strike Israel again"</a> if it doesn't de-escalate tensions in the region. "If the Hitler of our time (Netanyahu) stops his brutality and hostility, then his country won't have to face the consequences," Mr Elahi told NDTV.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>US Warning Of Severe Consequences</strong></h2>

<p>In response to the attack, US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan issued a stark warning to Iran, stating that the missile strike represented a "significant escalation" and that there would be "severe consequences." During a press briefing at the White House, Sullivan pledged that the US would stand by Israel and support any retaliatory measures.</p>

<p>US President Joe Biden echoed this sentiment, expressing full support for Israel and indicating that military discussions were underway to determine an appropriate response. Biden assured that the US military would assist in Israel's defence and intercept any further Iranian missile strikes. Asked about the scope of US involvement, Biden commented that discussions on a joint response were "active" and "ongoing."</p>

<h2><strong>The Attack And Aftermath</strong></h2>

<p>Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) claimed responsibility for the missile assault, targeting three Israeli military bases near Tel Aviv. Iranian Foreign Minister Seyed Abbas Araghchi declared the attack concluded unless Israel escalated further. The IRGC warned that any Israeli retaliation would result in "crushing attacks."</p>

<p>Although the majority of missiles were intercepted, there were scattered reports of damage and injuries. In Tel Aviv, two civilians were lightly injured by shrapnel, while in the West Bank city of Jericho, a Palestinian civilian was killed by debris from one of the missiles, news agency AFP reported. The Israeli military quickly announced that the immediate threat had passed, and civilians were allowed to leave bomb shelters after an hour.</p>

<h2><strong>Regional And Global Implications</strong></h2>

<p>Tehran's missile strike comes amid growing fears of a broader regional conflict. In a related escalation, Israeli forces conducted ground raids in southern Lebanon, targeting Hezbollah positions. Lebanese authorities reported that the latest Israeli airstrikes had killed at least 55 people, adding to the mounting casualties since the conflict intensified in early October.</p>

<p>Lebanon's health ministry stated that over 1,800 people had been killed since the conflict began, with hundreds of thousands displaced across the region. The potential for further escalation between Israel and Iranian-backed groups in Lebanon and Gaza has raised alarms across the international community.</p>

<h2><strong>International Reactions</strong></h2>

<p>UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemned the attack, calling for an immediate ceasefire and warning against the broadening conflict in the Middle East. "This must stop. We absolutely need a ceasefire," Guterres said in a statement.</p>

<p>As tensions continued to rise, Jordan, Iraq, and Israel closed their airspace, and flights were suspended at Tehran International Airport, Ben Gurion Airport in Israel, and other regional hubs. Neighbouring countries, including Iraq and Jordan, are bracing for further fallout, with Iran-backed Iraqi militias threatening to target US bases in the region should Washington become involved in the conflict.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Democrat Tim Walz and Republican JD Vance, two sons of America's Midwestern heartland with deeply opposing views on the issues gripping the country, shook hands on Tuesday night to start the only vice presidential debate of the Nov. 5 election.</p>

<p>Walz, 60, the liberal governor of Minnesota and a former high school teacher, and Vance, 40, a bestselling author and conservative firebrand US senator from Ohio, are expected to clash early and often, with each trying to land a lasting blow in an event that has historically had little measurable impact on White House campaigns.</p>

<p>Aides to the two men predicted fireworks during the 90-minute televised debate at the CBS Broadcast Center in New York, as they defended themselves and spoke up for the candidates at the top of each ticket, Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris and Republican former President Donald Trump.</p>

<p>Walz has called his Republican opponents "weird," and Vance came under fire for past comments disparaging some Democrats as "childless cat ladies."</p>

<p>Harris and Trump were expected to watch the debate, which began at 9 p.m. (0100 GMT on Wednesday), and Trump said he would offer a play-by-play commentary of the event on social media.</p>

<p>Harris was widely viewed as the winner of her sole debate with Trump on Sept. 10 in Philadelphia, which was watched by an estimated 67 million people.</p>

<p>That square-off did little to change the trajectory of an extremely close election battle. While Harris has edged ahead in national polls, most surveys show voters remain fairly evenly divided in the seven states that will decide the November election.</p>

<p>Political analysts say vice presidential debates can be fiery but generally do not alter the outcome of an election. That said, even a slight shift in public opinion could prove decisive with the race on a razor's edge five weeks before Election Day.</p>

<p>The main takeaway from the last V.P. debate, the 2020 encounter between then-Senator Harris and then-Vice President Mike Pence, was a fly that landed on Pence's head unbeknownst to Pence himself.</p>

<p>With no more debates planned, the stand-off allows Walz and Vance to make closing arguments on behalf of their campaigns - just as early voting ramps up across the country.</p>

<h3><strong>MUD-SLINGING</strong></h3>

<p>Walz, who has sought to cultivate a homespun image as a former high school football coach, is expected to get Vance to defend his 2021 comments criticizing Harris and other Democrats as "a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Walz is also likely to go after Vance for spreading a fictional story of Haitian immigrants eating household pets in Springfield, Ohio, a false claim that Trump has repeated and that local officials say has drawn bomb threats.</p>

<p>The Democrat will seek to introduce himself to U.S. voters who may not be familiar with him while aiming to keep the conversation focused on Harris' agenda, said a Walz adviser who asked to remain anonymous to discuss strategy.</p>

<p>Trump advisers said Vance will try to force Walz to defend the Biden-Harris administration's policies on immigration and the economy, as well as his own handling of the riots in Minneapolis in 2020 after the death of George Floyd, a Black man, at the hands of a white policeman.</p>

<p>Vance will also bring up questions about Walz's military service, said Tom Behrends, a retired command sergeant major who joined a Trump campaign call about the debate.</p>

<p>Republicans have accused Walz of exaggerating his final rank in the Army National Guard, where he served for 24 years. In the past, Walz described himself as a retired command sergeant major, one of the highest non-commissioned officer positions in the Army.</p>

<p>While he achieved that rank, he did not meet the requirements to retire with that title.</p>

<p>The Harris campaign says also Walz "misspoke" in 2018 during his gubernatorial campaign in Minnesota when he referred to "weapons of war, that I carried in war." Walz was never deployed to a war zone.</p>

<p>Vance is a former Marine who served as a military journalist. He was deployed to Iraq but never saw combat.</p>

<p>Earlier on Tuesday, Minnesota Public Radio reported that Walz was not in China during the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown as he had previously claimed but travelled there months later, another misstatement likely to draw Vance's fire.</p>

<p>Despite Vance's having written "Hillbilly Elegy," a popular 2016 memoir, US voters have a negative view of him, Reuters/Ipsos polling shows, with 51% of registered voters saying they view him unfavourably, compared with 39% who view him favourably. Meanwhile, Walz was viewed favourably by 44% of registered voters, with 43% reporting an unfavourable view in the Sept. 20-23 poll.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>an said early on Wednesday that its missile attack on Israel was finished barring further provocation, while Israel and the U.S. promised to retaliate against Tehran's escalation as fears of a wider war intensified.</p>

<p>Washington said it would work with longtime ally Israel to make sure Iran faced "severe consequences" for Tuesday's attack.</p>

<p>The United Nations Security Council scheduled a meeting about the Middle East for Wednesday, and the European Union called for an immediate ceasefire.</p>

<p>"Our action is concluded unless the Israeli regime decides to invite further retaliation. In that scenario, our response will be stronger and more powerful," Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said in a post on X early on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Israel early on Wednesday renewed its bombardment of Beirut's southern suburbs, a Hezbollah stronghold, with at least three strikes against what it said were targets belonging the group.</p>

<p>Large smoke plumes seen rising from parts of the suburbs. Israel issued new evacuation orders for the area, which have largely emptied after days of heavy strikes.</p>

<p>In its biggest ever military blow against Israel, Iran fired more than 180 ballistic missiles on Tuesday, according to Israel. Sirens sounded across the country and explosions rattled Jerusalem and the Jordan River valley as the entire population was told to seek shelter in bomb shelters.</p>

<p>No injuries were reported in Israel, but one man was killed in the occupied West Bank, authorities there said.</p>

<p>Iran described the campaign as defensive and solely aimed at Israeli military facilities. Iran's state news agency said three Israeli military bases had been targeted.</p>

<p>Tehran said its attack was responding to Israeli killings of militant leaders and aggression in Lebanon against the Iran-backed armed movement Hezbollah and in Gaza.</p>

<p>Israel activated air defences against Iran's bombardment and most missiles were intercepted "by Israel and a defensive coalition led by the United States," Israeli Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said in a video on X, adding: "Iran's attack is a severe and dangerous escalation."</p>

<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to hit back. "Iran made a big mistake tonight - and it will pay for it," Netanyahu said at the outset of an emergency political-security cabinet meeting late on Tuesday, according to a statement.</p>

<p>Any Israeli response to Tuesday's missile attack would be met with "vast destruction" of Israeli infrastructure, Iran's General Staff of the Armed Forces said in a statement carried by state media, also promising to target regional assets of any Israeli ally that got involved.</p>

<p>Fears that Iran and the U.S. would be drawn into a regional war have risen with Israel's growing assault on Lebanon in the past two weeks, including the start of a ground operation there on Monday, and its year-old conflict in the Gaza Strip.</p>

<p>Iran's forces on Tuesday used hypersonic Fattah missiles for the first time, and 90% of its missiles successfully hit their targets in Israel, the Revolutionary Guards said.</p>

<p>Israel's Hagari said central and southern Israel received limited strikes. A video released by the military showed a school in the central city of Gadera heavily damaged by an Iranian missile.</p>

<p>U.S. Navy warships fired about a dozen interceptors against Iranian missiles headed toward Israel, the Pentagon said. Britain said its forces played a part "in attempts to prevent further escalation in the Middle East" without elaborating.</p>

<p>U.S. President Joe Biden expressed full U.S. support for Israel and described Iran's attack as "ineffective." Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic candidate for U.S. president, backed Biden's stance and said the U.S. would not hesitate to defend its interests against Iran.</p>

<p>"We will act. Iran will soon feel the consequences of their actions. The response will be painful," Israel's U.N. Ambassador Danny Danon told reporters.</p>

<p><strong>U.S. DOES NOT URGE RESTRAINT</strong></p>

<p>The White House similarly promised "severe consequences" for Iran and spokesman Jake Sullivan told a Washington briefing the U.S. would "work with Israel to make that the case."</p>

<p>Sullivan did not specify what those consequences might be, but he stopped short of urging restraint by Israel as the U.S. did in April when Iran carried out a drone and missile attack on Israel. The Pentagon said Tuesday's airstrikes by Iran were about twice the size of April's assault.</p>

<p>U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemned what he called "escalation after escalation", saying: "This must stop. We absolutely need a ceasefire."</p>

<p>EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell also called for an immediate regional ceasefire. "The dangerous cycle of attacks and retaliation risks ... spiralling out of control," he posted on X.</p>

<p>British Prime Minister Keir Starmer spoke with the leaders of Germany and France, and they agreed on a need for restraint from all sides, Downing Street said.</p>

<p>Nearly 1,900 people have been killed and more than 9,000 wounded in Lebanon in almost a year of cross-border fighting, most in the past two weeks, according to Lebanese government statistics on Tuesday.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Tuesday survived a second vote of no confidence in as many weeks, brought again by his main Tory rival intent on unseating his beleaguered Liberals.</p>

<p>The 207 to 121 vote was largely a repeat of the Conservatives' failed attempt last week to trigger snap elections, which saw two smaller factions in parliament siding with Trudeau's minority government.</p>

<p>The motion accused the government of failing to address a housing crunch, rising crime and costs of living, and of being "the most centralizing government in Canadian history."</p>

<p>With a 20-point lead in public opinion polling, Tory leader Pierre Poilievre has been itching to go to the polls since the leftist New Democratic Party (NDP) last month tore up a coalition agreement with the Liberals, leaving the Trudeau administration vulnerable to being toppled.</p>

<p>But the NDP and other opposition parties, whose support is needed to bring down the Liberals, have pushed back against his right-wing agenda.</p>

<p>Still, Poilievre has vowed to keep trying.</p>

<p>In Canada's Westminster parliamentary system, a ruling party must hold the confidence of the House of Commons, which means maintaining support from a majority of members.</p>

<p>The Liberals currently have 153 seats, versus 119 for the Conservatives, 33 for the Bloc Quebecois, and the NDP's 25.</p>

<p>Trudeau swept to power in 2015, and has managed to hold on through two ballots in 2019 and 2021.</p>

<p>But his popularity has plunged and he has faced a number of setbacks in recent months, including by-election losses in two of his party's strongholds.</p>

<p>The deal with the New Democratic Party to prop up the Liberals would have kept his government in office until late 2025.</p>

<p>But the NDP, seeing its alignment with the Liberals hurting its own popularity, exited the pact early.</p>

<p>Most analysts have told AFP they do not anticipate Canadians going to the polls before spring 2025, but added that the situation is fluid.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the Liberals have been left weakened as they seek to continue governing in a fractured parliament.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A picture of billionaire Elon Musk with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni at a recent event has gone viral, triggering social media reactions that the two were "dating".</p>

<p>At an award ceremony in New York on Tuesday, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/elon-musk-calls-italy-pm-giorgia-meloni-authentic-honest-at-awards-gala-6636979" target="_blank">Musk also praised Meloni</a>, calling her "authentic, honest and truthful".</p>

<p>Musk, while bestowing the Atlantic Council Global Citizen Award on Meloni, said it was an honour to present the accolade to "someone who is even more beautiful on the inside than she was on the outside."</p>

<p>"Giorgia Meloni is someone I admire, who has done an incredible job as the Prime Minister of Italy," he said.</p>

<p>"She's also someone who is authentic, honest, truthful - and that can't always be said about politicians," Musk added.</p>

<p>She also took to her official X account and thanked Musk for his remarks.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The son of Ryan Routh, who is accused of plotting to assassinate Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump at his golf course, has been arrested on charges of possessing child pornography. Oran Alexander Routh has been charged with one count of receipt of child pornography and another count of possession of child pornography, NBC News reported.</p>

<p>Records at a district court showed Oran Routh was arrested on Tuesday, while there was no attorney listed for him. As per public reports, Oran is the son of Ryan Routh, who is believed to have hatched the plot to target the former US president at his golf club in West Palm Beach, Florida, on September 15.</p>

<p><strong>'Hundreds' of files uncovered</strong></p>

<p>An FBI search was carried out at Oran's home in North Carolina on Saturday in connection with an unrelated case, as per the criminal complaint.&nbsp;An SD card found in a phone in his bedroom allegedly contained "hundreds" of files having child sex abuse images.</p>

<p>The files include videos from a "known" series. It includes videos of an adult man with a "prepubescent" girl, believed to be under the age of 10, the complaint states.</p>

<p>Another handset, recovered from Oran Routh's possession, had a downloaded folder with additional video files. A review of the device uncovered a video of an adult woman with a child, aged around 6-8 years.</p>

<p>Further, investigating officers also uncovered a messaging app on the smartphone which is "commonly used by individuals who distribute and receive child pornography."</p>

<p>According to the complaint, the individual, who sent the messages from the handset asked for a preview of digital content being sold. Later, two files were shared and both included adults engaging in sexual activities with minors.</p>

<p>The warrant for Oran's arrest was filed in the federal court on Monday, the NBC News report states.</p>

<p><strong>Cocaine, MDMA, Ketamine seized</strong></p>

<p>Meanwhile, Oran Routh has also been charged with drug possession as the law enforcement officers seized cocaine, Ketamine and MDMA along with gold and black trays having white powdery substance from his house.</p>

<p>It further prompted two felony and two misdemeanour charges for possession, records show.</p>

<p><strong>Case against Ryan Routh</strong></p>

<p>On Tuesday, US prosecutors charged Ryan Routh with the attempt to kill Donald Trump, according to the US Department of Justice. He has also been charged with possession of a firearm in furtherance of a crime of violence, assaulting a Secret Service agent among others.</p>

<p>He is currently in custody and faces a maximum of life in prison if found convicted in the case.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The 2020 clash between Indian and Chinese troops in Galwan Valley overshadowed the relations between the two countries and New Delhi's focus for the last four years has been disengagement on the border, External Affairs Minister Dr S Jaishankar has said.</p>

<p>Addressing an event titled 'India, Asia and the World' in New York yesterday, Dr Jaishankar said the India-China relationship is key to the future of Asia and would influence the entire world.</p>

<p>"I think the India-China relationship is key to the future of Asia. In a way, you can say that if the world is to be multi-polar, Asia has to be multi-polar. And therefore this relationship will influence not just the future of Asia, but in that way, perhaps the future of the world as well," Dr Jaishankar said, according to news agency PTI. The event was hosted by Asia Society and Asia Society Policy Institute.</p>

<p>The External Affairs Minister said India had a "difficult history" with China. "You have two countries who are neighbours, unique in the sense that they are the only two countries with over a billion people, both rising in the global order and who often have overlapping peripheries, including the fact that they have a common border. So it's really a very complicated issue. I think, if you look today in global politics, the parallel rises of India and China present a very, very unique problem," he said.</p>

<p>He referred to a recent remark that 75 per cent of the disengagement problems with China have been sorted out. "When I said 75 per cent of it has been sorted out - I was asked in a way to quantify - it's only of the disengagement. So that's one part of the problem. The main issue right now is the patrolling. You know, how do we, both of us, patrol up to the Line of Actual Control."</p>

<p>Dr Jaishankar said patrolling arrangements have been disturbed after 2020. "So we've been able to sort out much of the disengagement, the friction points, but some of the patrolling issues need to be resolved." He said that once the disengagement issue is dealt with, "there is the larger issue as both of us have brought a very large number of troops up to the border". "So there is what we call the de-escalation issue, and then there is the larger, the next step is really, how do you deal with the rest of the relationship?"</p>

<p>The minister said the "entire 3500 kilometre-border between India and China is disputed". "And so you make sure the border is peaceful so that other parts of the relationship can move."</p>

<p>Dr Jaishankar said several agreements between the two countries detailed how to ensure the border remained peaceful.</p>

<p>"Now the problem was in 2020, despite these very explicit agreements, we saw that the Chinese - we were all in the middle of Covid at that time - moved a large number of forces in violation of these agreements to the Line of Actual Control. And we responded in kind," he said. "Once troops were deployed very close up, which is 'very dangerous', it was likely a mishap could happen, and it did happen."</p>

<p>Referring to the 2020 Galwan clash, he said, "So there was a clash, and a number of troops died on either side, and that has since, in a sense, overshadowed the relationship. So until we can restore peace and tranquillity on the border and ensure the agreements signed up to are adhered to, it's obviously difficult to carry on with the rest of the relationship."</p>

<p>The External Affairs Minister said the focus for the last four years had been to at least disengage the troops, meaning that they go back to the camp, the military bases from which they traditionally operate.&nbsp;"Because right now, both sides have troops deployed forward," he said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The digital rights group NOYB (None Of Your Business) said Mozilla has enabled a feature that turned the browser into a tracking tool for websites without directly telling its users.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Vienna-based advocacy group NOYB on Wednesday said it has filed a complaint with the Austrian data protection authority against Mozilla accusing the Firefox browser maker of tracking user behaviour on websites without consent. NOYB (None Of Your Business), the digital rights group founded by privacy activist Max Schrems, said Mozilla has enabled a so-called "privacy preserving attribution" feature that turned the browser into a tracking tool for websites without directly telling its users.</p>

<p>Mozilla had defended the feature, saying it wanted to help websites understand how their ads perform without collecting data about individual people. By offering what it called a non-invasive alternative to cross-site tracking, it hoped to significantly reduce collecting individual information.</p>

<p>While this may be less invasive than unlimited tracking, it still interferes with user rights under the EU's privacy laws, NOYB said, adding that Firefox has turned on the feature by default.</p>

<p>"It's a shame that an organisation like Mozilla believes that users are too dumb to say yes or no," said Felix Mikolasch, data protection lawyer at NOYB. "Users should be able to make a choice and the feature should have been turned off by default."</p>

<p>Open-source Firefox was once a top browser choice among users due to its privacy features but now lags market leader Google's Chrome, Apple's Safari and Microsoft's Edge with a low single-digit market share.</p>

<p>NOYB wants Mozilla to inform users about its data processing activities, switch to an opt-in system and delete all unlawfully processed data of millions of affected users.</p>

<p>NOYB, which in June filed a complaint against Alphabet for allegedly tracking users of its Chrome browser, had also filed hundreds of complaints against big tech companies, some leading to big fines.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[In a first, an American woman reportedly died by suicide inside a new 3D-printed "suicide pod", Sarco, in a forest cabin in Merishausen, Switzerland.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a first, an American woman reportedly died by suicide inside a new 3D-printed “suicide pod”, Sarco, in a forest cabin in Merishausen, Switzerland. The 64-year-old woman, who has not been publicly named, entered the Sarco pod on Monday. The machine allegedly encouraged her with a chilling message before her last moments, “If you want to die, press this button,” according to a report by AFP.</p>

<p>The Sarco pod, short for ‘sarcophagus', operates by flooding its chamber with nitrogen gas. That leads to a rapid decrease in oxygen levels due to which the person becomes unconscious within moments. Death typically occurs within ten minutes.</p>

<p>Florian Willet, co-president of the assisted suicide group Exit International's Swiss affiliate, the Last Resort, was the only witness present during the incident. He described the woman's death as “peaceful, fast and dignified,” as reported by the organisation. The woman suffered from “severe immune compromise,” the group said.</p>

<p>Dr Philip Nitschke, director of Exit International was “pleased” by the pod's performance. He stated, “I am pleased that the Sarco had performed exactly as it had been designed… to provide an elective, non-drug, peaceful death at the time of the person's choosing.”</p>

<p>Although the pod is designed with an emergency exit button, the device is not yet legally approved for use. Authorities have since arrested several individuals connected to the woman's death.</p>

<p>Switzerland allows assisted suicide, but individuals must do so without help from a doctor, meaning those who assist cannot act for selfish reasons. Unlike the Netherlands, where euthanasia with medical assistance is legal, Swiss law forbids euthanasia entirely.</p>

<p>Swiss Health Minister Elisabeth Baume-Schneider has voiced scepticism regarding the Sarco pod's potential approval, noting, “It does not fulfil the demands of the product safety law, and as such, must not be brought into circulation.” She added that the use of nitrogen is “not compatible with the article on purpose in the chemicals law.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Longtime foes Hezbollah and Israel have been locked in near-daily exchanges of cross-border fire since Hamas launched an unprecedented attack on Israel on October 7.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli warplanes pounded villages in south Lebanon for a third day, Lebanese media reported Wednesday, while Israel said it intercepted a missile fired after sirens sounded early morning in Tel Aviv. Lebanese officials said hundreds of thousands of civilians have fled their homes in the south this week to avoid <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/decades-of-covert-conflict-the-israel-lebanon-shadow-war-6636815">fighting between Hezbollah and the Israeli military</a>.</p>

<p>Lebanon's official National News Agency said Israeli warplanes launched raids on multiple towns in the south from 5:00 am (0200 GMT), adding "casualties were reported" from other strikes overnight.</p>

<p>The United Nations Security Council said it will hold an emergency meeting on the crisis in New York Wednesday, while UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned the situation was critical.</p>

<p>Hundreds of thousands of people have been displaced since the latest round of fighting began Monday, officials said, some crossing the border to Syria to flee Israeli bombing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thuraya Harb, a 41-year-old housewife at a makeshift centre for displaced families in Beirut, said her family fled "with nothing but the clothes on our backs".</p>

<p>"I didn't want to leave my home, but the children were scared," the mother of four said.</p>

<p>Longtime foes Hezbollah and Israel have been locked in near-daily exchanges of cross-border fire since Palestinian group Hamas launched an unprecedented attack on Israel on October 7.</p>

<p>The Hamas attack sparked a war in Gaza that has drawn in Hezbollah and other Iran-backed militants from across the Middle East, including Yemen and Iraq.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/lebanese-take-refuge-in-shelters-after-long-trips-fleeing-israeli-bombing-6641864">Lebanon</a> said Israeli strikes killed at least 558 people on Monday -- the deadliest day of violence in the country since its 1975-90 civil war.</p>

<p>Lebanese Health Minister Firass Abiad said the "vast majority, if not all" of those killed were unarmed civilians in their homes.</p>

<p>Israel's military said Wednesday it intercepted a missile fired from Lebanon after sirens sounded in Tel Aviv.</p>

<p>"Following the sirens that sounded in the Tel Aviv and Netanya areas, one surface-to-surface missile was identified crossing from Lebanon and was intercepted," a military spokesman said.</p>

<h3><strong>Hezbollah's Rocket Commander Killed</strong></h3>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/lebanon-faces-biggest-israeli-attack-in-4-decades-all-about-the-1982-lebanese-war-6636511">Hezbollah</a> claimed 18 attacks on Israel on Tuesday, while the Israeli military said the Iran-backed group fired about 300 rockets across the border.</p>

<p>Hezbollah also confirmed an Israeli claim that it had killed its rocket forces commander <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/israel-hezbollah-lebanon-hezbollah-missile-chief-killed-in-israeli-airstrike-on-beirut-10-points-6643300#pfrom=home-ndtv_topscroll">Ibrahim Kobeissi</a> in the strike on the Lebanese capital.</p>

<p>Early Wednesday, a Lebanese security source said a new Israeli strike hit the Saadiyat area near Beirut, with a "warehouse" targeted.</p>

<p>At the UN General Assembly in New York, Secretary-General Guterres warned the situation in Lebanon was critical.</p>

<p>"We should all be alarmed by the escalation. Lebanon is at the brink," he said, while cautioning against "the possibility of transforming Lebanon (into) another Gaza".</p>

<p>US President Joe Biden warned against a full-blown war in Lebanon in his speech during the New York gathering.</p>

<p>"Full-scale war is not in anyone's interest. Even though the situation has escalated, a diplomatic solution is still possible," Biden said.</p>

<p>Lebanon's foreign minister, also at the UN assembly, said the number of displaced Lebanese had soared to nearly 500,000 since Israel ramped up its military campaign.</p>

<p>A security official in neighbouring Syria told AFP about 500 people had crossed the border to flee the bombing.</p>

<h3><strong>Defiant Netanyahu</strong></h3>

<p>Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to continue the withering air campaign.</p>

<p>"We will continue to hit Hezbollah... the one who has a missile in his living room and a rocket in his home will not have a home," he said.</p>

<p>Iran, Hezbollah's main backer, condemned the raids, with its president, Masoud Pezeshkian, saying its ally "cannot stand alone" against Israel.</p>

<p>"We must not allow Lebanon to become another Gaza at the hands of Israel," he said.</p>

<p>A US official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Washington opposed an Israeli ground invasion targeting Hezbollah and had "concrete ideas" on how to de-escalate the crisis.</p>

<p>Israel's ambassador to the UN, Danny Danon, said Israel was "not eager to start any ground invasion" in Lebanon.</p>

<p>Britain's foreign ministry said Tuesday that it was sending military teams to Cyprus as it prepares "contingency plans" for its citizens in Lebanon, who it urged to immediately leave the country.</p>

<h3><strong>'New phase'</strong></h3>

<p>The war in Gaza began with Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel, which resulted in the deaths of 1,205 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures that include hostages killed in captivity.</p>

<p>Of the 251 hostages seized by militants, 97 are still held in Gaza, including 33 the Israeli military says are dead.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory military offensive has killed at least 41,467 people in Gaza, most of them civilians, according to figures provided by the Hamas-run territory's health ministry. The UN has described the figures as reliable.</p>

<p>In a statement addressed to the UN chief, Hamas urged "immediate action" to stop the war in Gaza.</p>

<p>Since the start of the Gaza war, clashes along the Lebanon-Israel border have forced tens of thousands of people on both sides to flee their homes.</p>

<p>The violence between Israel and Hezbollah escalated dramatically last week, when coordinated communications device blasts that the militants blamed on Israel killed 39 people and wounded almost 3,000.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Comet C/2023 A3, also known as Tsuchinshan-ATLAS, is returning to Earth. Our ancestors last witnessed this uncommon sight about 80,000 years ago. This comet, which resembles a fuzzy star with a tail, can be seen in the early morning hours of the sky from Friday through Monday. Even a beautiful video of it was taken by NASA astronaut Matthew Dominick, who is presently stationed on the International Space Station.</p>

<p>"So far, Comet Tsuchinshan-ATLAS looks like a fuzzy star to the naked eye looking out the cupola windows. But with a 200mm f/2 lens at 1/8s exposure, you can really start to see it. This comet is going to make for some really cool images as it gets closer to the sun. For now a timelapse preview," Dominick captioned the video in his X post.</p>

By the end of September 2024, it will be a morning object, perhaps shining as brightly as mag. +0.6 but rising just before the sun. Comet C/2023 A3 will reach perihelion-the closest point to the Sun in its orbit-on 28 September 2024. Our best views of A3 will come when it moves up into the evening sky around 10 October. By then it will have faded slightly but is predicted to still be as bright as mag. +0.8, low in the west after sunset."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the driest places on Earth is seeing a surprising burst of greenery, as heavy rainfall has led to vegetation sprouting across the typically barren Sahara Desert.&nbsp;NASA's satellite images reveal patches of plant life emerging in the desert following an extratropical cyclone that drenched parts of northwestern Africa on September 7 and 8. Regions in Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, and Libya, which rarely receive rain, are now showing traces of green, according to <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/153320/a-deluge-for-the-sahara" rel="nofollow, noindex">NASA's Earth Observatory</a></em>.</p>

<p>Shrubs and trees are growing in low-lying areas like riverbeds, explained Sylwia Trzaska, a climate variability researcher at the Columbia Climate School. Peter de Menocal, president of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, noted that while it's rare, plant life does respond quickly to heavy rain events in this part of Africa. When substantial rain falls, dunes transform into lush, green landscapes for a brief time as plants take full advantage of the moisture.</p>

<p>Historically, the Sahara was once covered in vegetation and lakes between 11,000 and 5,000 years ago, de Menocal's past research suggests. Now, even lakes that are typically dry are filling up due to this recent deluge, according to Moshe Armon, a lecturer at the Institute of Earth Sciences, Hebrew University of Jerusalem.</p>

<p>The unusual rainfall event was triggered by the northward movement of the tropical rain belt, known as the Intertropical Convergence Zone, reaching farther north than usual, bringing heavy rains typical of equatorial regions into the Sahara. Some areas saw over half a foot of rain, which far exceeds the typical annual precipitation of just a few inches.</p>

<p>While the rains largely affected sparsely populated areas, devastating floods have killed over 1,000 people and affected around 4 million across 14 African nations, according to the World Food Programme and the Associated Press.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Experts believe the shift in the rain belt is influenced by record-high ocean temperatures and climate change, which could lead to further changes in rainfall patterns across Africa. However, as ocean temperatures balance out globally, the rain belt is expected to shift back south, potentially crossing the equator, according to de Menocal.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake appointed a new Cabinet of Ministers on Tuesday evening, with Prime Minister Harini Amarasuriya, lawmaker Vijitha Herath and himself taking on Cabinet portfolios.</p>

<p>Dissanayake will now oversee defence, finance, economic development, policy formulation, planning, tourism, energy, agriculture, lands, livestock, irrigation, fisheries and aquatic resources, Xinhua news agency reported.</p>

<p>Dissanayake, 55, has taken the key finance portfolio himself as Sri Lanka looks to emerge from its most punishing economic crisis in 70 years and its first debt default, while keeping promises to aid the nation's poor.</p>

<p>The Marxist-leaning firebrand politician will also hold the economic development and tourism jobs in the cabinet.</p>

<p>Dissanayake's intentions to slash taxes and desire to revisit the terms of a $2.9 billion International Monetary Fund bailout have worried investors, who fear that it could delay a crucial $25 billion debt restructuring.</p>

<p>His comments during Monday's inauguration offered few clues as to how hardline his economic approach will be.</p>

<p>"Our politics needs to be cleaner, and the people have called for a different political culture," the 55-year-old said.</p>

<p>"I am ready to commit to that change."</p>

<p>Dissanayake ran in Saturday's presidential election as the candidate for the National People's Power coalition, which includes his Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna Party that traditionally championed Marxist economic policies centred on protectionism and state intervention. In recent years the party has taken more centrist positions.</p>

<p>Earlier, Amarasuriya was sworn in as the Prime Minister, and was appointed as the Minister of justice, public administration, provincial councils, local government, education, science and technology, labour, women, child and youth affairs, sports, trade, commerce, food security, co-operative development, industries and entrepreneur development, and health.</p>

<p>Herath was assigned the Minister of Buddhist affairs, religious and cultural affairs, national integration, social security, mass media, transport, highways, ports and civil aviation, public security, and foreign affairs, environment, wildlife, forest resources, water supply, plantation and community, infrastructure, rural and urban development, housing and construction.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The India-US relationship is “strong and getting stronger”, the White House said, adding that President Joe Biden when looks back at his term will be most proud of deepening the partnership with India, making it more inclusive and broadening.</p>

<p>"I think one word -- well, actually, three words: strong, and getting stronger,” White House National Security Communications Advisor John Kirby said on Tuesday during a press briefing here.</p>

<p>Kirby was responding to a question by Press Trust of India on how he would characterise the trajectory of bilateral relations under Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Biden as his term as the American leader ends soon.</p>

<p>Biden has “invested a lot in our bilateral relationship with India”, Kirby told PTI.</p>

<p>He elevated the Quad group of Australia, Japan, India and the US to the leader level and hosted PM&nbsp;Modi for an official state visit in June last year.</p>

<p>“We've elevated our strategic partnership to the highest level. We are pursuing a defence relationship on various systems that will make not just the Indian people safer, but people safer throughout the Indo-Pacific,” Kirby said.</p>

<p>Kirby said Biden “appreciates” the perspective Modi brings to these discussions.</p>

<p>“I mean, he lives in that neighbourhood; he understands it. And of course, he's the leader of one of the most vibrant democracies in the world.” “So I think as the president looks back at his term, I believe one of the things he'll be most proud of is deepening this partnership with India, but just as critically, making that partnership more inclusive and broadening it so that it is not just a bilateral – it's a strong bilateral relationship," he said.</p>

<p>Biden on September 21 hosted Quad leaders Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese of Australia, and Prime Minister Kishida Fumio of Japan in Wilmington, Delaware, for the fourth Quad Leaders' Summit.</p>

<p>Kirby said India, as witnessed in Wilmington, “a full-on member of this Indo-Pacific Quad, is a real contributing partner. And it's more than just the security. It's on the economic, it's on technology, it's on energy and clean energy transition, and international investments, on so many levels.” Biden addressed world leaders from the podium of the UN General Assembly on Tuesday, delivering his last address as President of the US as his term comes to an end following his decision to pull out from the presidential election.</p>

<p>The US heads into presidential elections in just over a month with Americans set to vote on November 5 and pick either Democratic nominee Vice President Kamala Harris or Republican candidate former president Donald Trump as their next leader.</p>

<p>Biden announced earlier this summer that he would not seek re-election as President of the United States, passing on the baton to Harris, who has made history as the first woman of Indian and Black heritage to be nominated as an American presidential candidate.</p>

<p>“This summer, I faced a decision whether to seek a second term as President. It was a difficult decision. Being president has been the honour of my life. There's so much more I want to get done. As much as I love this job, I love my country more. I decided, after 50 years of public service, it's time for the new generation of leadership to take my nation forward. My fellow leaders, let us never forget that some things are more important than staying in power. It's your people,” Biden said to a round of huge applause from the world leaders in the UNGA hall.</p>

<p>“We are here to serve the people, not the other way around.”&nbsp;</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A new analysis of arrowheads discovered at the Tollense Valley battlefield, Europe's oldest known battlefield, is shedding light on the warriors who clashed there 3,250 years ago, <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/23/science/tollense-valley-bronze-age-battlefield-arrowheads/index.html" rel="nofollow, noindex">CNN </a></em>reported.</p>

<p>Researchers have unearthed a trove of artefacts, including bronze and flint arrowheads, swords, wooden clubs, and human remains. By studying these items, they have determined that the battle involved both local groups and an army from a southern region.</p>

<p>This finding suggests that the Tollense Valley battle was the earliest example of interregional conflict in Europe. Previous studies had hinted at the involvement of outsiders, but the arrowhead analysis provides concrete evidence.</p>

<p>"The arrowheads are a kind of 'smoking gun,'" said lead study author Leif Inselmann, a researcher at the Berlin Graduate School of Ancient Studies within the Free University of Berlin, in a statement. "Just like the murder weapon in a mystery, they give us a clue about the culprit, the fighters of the Tollense Valley battle and where they came from."</p>

<p>The researchers compared the arrowheads to known examples from across Central Europe and found that some were made locally, while others originated from a southern region. This suggests that at least one faction in the battle was from a distant location.</p>

<p>The arrowheads, like a murder weapon in a mystery, offer crucial clues about the participants and the nature of the conflict. This groundbreaking research helps piece together the story behind one of Europe's most ancient and brutal battles.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told the UN Security Council that "we have to prepare" the second peace summit to end the Russia-Ukraine war "altogether" and he has invited India and other countries to join the peace process.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told the UN Security Council that “we have to prepare” the second peace summit to end the Russia-Ukraine war “altogether” and he has invited India and other countries to join the peace process.</p>

<p>“We all know what needs to be done if we honestly look at the situation and truly want to stop Russia's war. Most importantly, act together, of course in unity, without creating new and unnecessary divisions of the world into blocks or regional groups,” Zelenskyy here on Tuesday told a Security Council meeting on the Ukraine conflict.</p>

<p>Zelenskyy said that unity always works for peace and “we have to prepare the second peace summit to end the war altogether. And I invite all of you, all principle nations to join us in this process, all who truly respect the UN Charter. We invite China. We invite Brazil. I have already invited India. We are working with African nations, all of Latin America, the Middle East, Central Asia, Europe, the Pacific region, and North America. All.” Zelenskyy said all are "equally important for peace, all without exceptions. Just as the UN Charter must work without exceptions”.</p>

<p>The Ukrainian president said this process will “lead us to peace, to a just peace, a real peace, a peace that will last. All of us already know how to achieve it. We have the peace formula, we have the UN Charter and we have all the strength needed to make it happen. What's needed is determination.” Zelenskyy on Monday met Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New York before the Indian leader wrapped up his three-day visit to the US.</p>

<p>PM Modi's meeting with Zelenskyy, requested by the Ukrainian side, came at the sidelines of his other engagements, including participating in the Quad Leaders' Summit and his address to the UN's 'Summit of the Future'.</p>

<p>The meeting between PM Modi and Zelenskyy was their third in a little over three months.</p>

<p>PM Modi met the Ukrainian leader in Kyiv last month, just weeks after he had met Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow in July.</p>

<p>In June, PM Modi held a bilateral meeting with Zelenskyy on the sidelines of the G7 Summit in Italy.</p>

<p>“We are committed to implementing the outcomes of my visit to Ukraine last month to strengthen bilateral relations. Reiterated India's support for early resolution of the conflict in Ukraine and restoration of peace and stability,” the prime minister said on X following Monday's meeting with Zelenskyy.</p>

<p>Zelenskyy, noting that this was already the third bilateral meeting this year with PM Modi, said the main focus of their conversation was on “enhancing our interaction on international platforms, particularly at the UN and G20 as well as implementing the peace formula and preparing for the second peace summit. We had a substantive discussion on the available opportunities.” “We are actively developing our relations and working together to strengthen cooperation across various fields,” the Ukrainian president said, adding that he was “grateful for the clear support of our sovereignty and territorial integrity”. Responding to a question during a press briefing on discussions with the Ukrainian leader on a second peace summit, Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri said the discussions covered a lot of issues related to finding a way forward.</p>

<p>Mr Misri said a number of things came up, the peace summit that was held in Switzerland, the ideas that have been floated after that, the efforts that Ukraine is making on its own and the possibility of a second peace summit that Ukraine has been talking.</p>

<p>“But I think we are not right now at a stage where the second peace summit can be discussed in any detail. I think there is a lot of work that remains to be done before that, so there was not a great deal of discussion on that specific issue.” Pavan Kapoor, Secretary (West) at the Ministry of External Affairs, represented India at the 'Summit on Peace in Ukraine' hosted by Switzerland at Burgenstock on June 15-16.</p>

<p>The Indian delegation attended the opening and closing plenary sessions but India did not associate itself with any communique/document emerging from this summit.</p>

<p>“India's participation in the summit and preceding NSA/Political Director-level meetings based on Ukraine's peace formula was in line with our consistent approach to facilitate a lasting and peaceful resolution to the conflict through dialogue and diplomacy. We continue to believe that such a resolution requires a sincere and practical engagement between the two parties to the conflict,” the MEA said.</p>

<p>In this regard, India will continue to remain engaged with all stakeholders and both parties to contribute to all earnest efforts to bring about an early and abiding peace, the MEA added.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Chinese defence ministry said it was a "routine arrangement in our annual training plan" and not directed at any country or target.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>China publicly acknowledged for the first time that it successfully launched an intercontinental ballistic missile into the Pacific Ocean on Wednesday, in a move likely to raise international concerns about the country's nuclear build-up.</p>

<p>The ICBM, carrying a dummy warhead, was launched by the People's Liberation Army Rocket Force at 08:44 a.m. Beijing time (0044 GMT) on Wednesday and "fell into expected sea areas," the Chinese defence ministry said in a statement, adding it was a "routine arrangement in our annual training plan" and not directed at any country or target.</p>

<p>China "informed the countries concerned in advance," according to a separate Xinhua report, which did not clarify the path of the missile or where exactly in the "high seas of the Pacific Ocean" it fell.</p>

<p>The launch "effectively tested the performance of weapons and equipment and the training level of the troops, and achieved the expected goal," Xinhua reported.</p>

<p>The PLA Rocket Force, which oversees the country's conventional and nuclear missiles, has been tasked with modernising China's nuclear forces to deter developments such as improved U.S. missile defences, better surveillance capabilities, and strengthened alliances.</p>

<p>Some analysts, however, argue the speed of China's nuclear build-up goes beyond a credible minimum deterrence.</p>

<p>Beijing says it adheres to a "no first use" policy.</p>

<p>The Chinese military has emphasised that the Central Military Commission, headed by President Xi Jinping, is the only nuclear command authority.</p>

<p>China, which has been frequently criticised by the US for the opacity of its nuclear build-up, scrapped nuclear talks with Washington in July over U.S. arms sales to Taiwan.</p>

<p>China has more than 500 operational nuclear warheads in its arsenal, of which approximately 350 are ICBMs, and will probably have over 1,000 warheads by 2030, the Pentagon estimated last year. China's military is constructing hundreds of secret silos for land-based ICBMs, the Pentagon said in the report.</p>

<p>That compares to 1,770 and 1,710 operational warheads deployed by the U.S. and Russia, respectively. The Pentagon said that by 2030, much of Beijing's weapons will likely be held at higher readiness levels.</p>

<p>Democratically governed Taiwan, which China claims as its own territory, has complained of increased Chinese military activities around the island in the past five years.</p>

<p>Taiwan's defence ministry said on Wednesday it had detected 23 Chinese military aircraft, including J-16 fighters and drones, operating around Taiwan carrying out long-range missions to the southeast and east of the island.</p>

<p>The ministry added it had also recently detected "intensive" Chinese missile firing and other drills, though it did not give details of where that took place.</p>

<p>Taiwan has dispatched its own air and naval forces to keep watch, the ministry said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A massive, fluffy brown furball waddled across his Australian aquarium home, towering over the other penguins.&nbsp;Pesto, a nine-month-old penguin chick, has shot to fame for his massive weight of 22.5 kilograms (49.6 pounds).</p>

<p>He is the largest penguin the Sea Life Melbourne has ever seen. With a healthy diet of 25 fish a day, his fluffy frame may grow yet.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Aquarium keeper Michaela Smale said Pesto's parents, Tango and Hudson, weigh only about 11 kilograms each -- making Pesto more than their combined weight.</p>

<p>"When he hatched, he was 200 grams (0.44 pounds)," Smale told Australia's national broadcaster.&nbsp;</p>

<p>She added that king penguin chicks bulk up to protect themselves against the freezing Antarctic temperatures. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Although podgy Pesto is chunkier than most chicks. &nbsp;</p>

<p>"He is a chunky monkey, but he is healthy," she told the ABC. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Pesto's genetics also account for his massive size -- his ancestors were some of the biggest and oldest penguins the aquarium has housed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As the chicks get older, they shed their fluffy, brown outer layer as their adult feathers develop. &nbsp;</p>

<p>In the wild, king penguins are found in Antarctica and their population remains fairly stable, with about 1.6 million breeding pairs. &nbsp;</p>

<p>During the 19th and 20th centuries, king penguin populations were almost wiped out because they were heavily hunted for their meat, oil and blubber. &nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two men on death row in the United States were executed Tuesday, including a Black man convicted of murder who had maintained his innocence and drawn support from civil rights groups. Marcellus Williams, 55, was sentenced to death in the midwestern state of Missouri for the 1998 killing of Felicia Gayle, a former newspaper reporter.</p>

<p>He was pronounced dead at 6:10 pm local time Tuesday, according to the Missouri Department of Corrections.</p>

<p>Travis Mullis, 38, was also put to death in Huntsville, Texas for stomping his three-month-old son, Alijah Mullis, to death in 2008.</p>

<p>"I do regret the decision to take the life of my son, I apologize to the mother of my son, the victim's family," Mullis said in his last statement.</p>

<p>Both men were executed by lethal injection, raising the total number of US executions this year to 16.</p>

<p>Williams has insisted he is innocent and the NAACP civil rights group had urged Governor Michael Parson to stay his execution.</p>

<p>Parson on Tuesday said that Williams's execution in Missouri would go ahead despite protests.</p>

<p>"No jury nor court, including at the trial, appellate, and Supreme Court levels, have ever found merit in Mr. Williams's innocence claim. At the end of the day, his guilty verdict and sentence of capital punishment were upheld," Parson said in a statement.</p>

<p>The US Supreme Court had also rejected a last-ditch request to stay Williams's execution on Tuesday.</p>

<p>British billionaire Richard Branson, who bought a full-page advert in the Kansas City Star newspaper decrying a "devastating miscarriage of justice," mourned Williams's execution on social media.</p>

<p>"It's a shameful day for Missouri, and a shameful day for Governor Mike Parson," Branson wrote on X.</p>

<p>Felicia Gayle was found dead at her St. Louis home in Missouri, stabbed 43 times by a kitchen knife during what appeared to be a burglary gone wrong.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Williams, who had previous convictions for burglary and robbery, was convicted on the testimony of a former jail cellmate and an ex-girlfriend, though his DNA was not found on the knife or at the crime scene.</p>

<p>His execution was stayed by the Missouri Supreme Court in 2015, and again by the state's then-governor Eric Greitens in 2017, following the discovery of male DNA on the knife that did not match Williams.</p>

<p>This year, local prosecutors initiated proceedings to overturn his conviction. However, on Monday, the state Supreme Court ruled in a unanimous decision that it would not stop Williams's execution.</p>

<p>The death penalty has been abolished in 23 US states, while six others -- Arizona, California, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania and Tennessee -- have moratoriums in place.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A woman from Minnesota, Nicole Hammond, 28, was tragically killed outside her workplace in October 2022 after repeatedly rejecting the sexual advances of a colleague, Michael J. Carpenter. Carpenter, 38, shot Hammond in the neck in the parking lot of Dubow Textile, where they both worked. Last week, Carpenter was sentenced to life without parole after being found guilty of first-degree premeditated murder and second-degree intentional murder, according to Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison.</p>

<p>The murder took place the morning after an argument between the two, in which Ms Hammond had expressed her refusal to be touched or manipulated by Carpenter, as revealed by text messages, the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://people.com/man-sentenced-murdering-coworker-rebuffed-advances-8717319" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>People </em></a>reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ms Hammond's coworkers were reportedly aware of Carpenter's repeated harassment, but no formal complaint had been made to upper management, according to her boss, Rob Dubow.</p>

<p>Ellison released a statement expressing his condolences to Hammond's friends and family, remembering her as a "talented, kind, and caring soul who loved art and nature" and noting that she will be greatly missed. He also expressed hope that Carpenter's sentencing would bring some level of peace to Hammond's loved ones.</p>

<p>"Carpenter approached Hammond before her work shift in the parking lot of Dubow Textile, armed with a 9mm pistol, and fired a single shot through Hammond's neck," the attorney general said in a news release.</p>

<p>"My thoughts are with Nicole Hammond's friends, family, and community today. Nicole was a talented, kind, and caring soul who loved art and nature. She will be missed by many," Ellison added in a statement. "I am pleased that today, the Court held Michael Carpenter fully accountable for the crime he committed. I hope this accountability is eventually able to bring some measure of peace to Nicole's loved ones."</p>

<p>Ms Hammond was in the process of starting her own jewellery business at the time of her death. Her obituary described her as a talented writer who loved working on her car with her father and enjoyed outdoor activities such as hiking, kayaking, and photography. She had dreamed of moving to Fort Myers, Florida, and was deeply cherished by those who knew her.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Saudi Arabia has allegedly issued a warning to Pakistan to take action against the growing number of Pakistani beggars arriving in the country under the guise of religious pilgrimage.</p>

<p>Pakistan's Express Tribune newspaper reported on Tuesday that the Saudi authorities have also warned that if the situation is not controlled, it could negatively affect Pakistani Umrah and Hajj pilgrims.</p>

<p>"The Saudi Ministry of Hajj has issued a warning to Pakistan's Ministry of Religious Affairs, urging action to prevent Pakistani beggars from entering the kingdom under Umrah visas," the newspaper said.</p>

<p>In response, Pakistan's Ministry of Religious Affairs has decided to introduce an "Umrah Act," which aims to regulate travel agencies facilitating Umrah trips, bringing them under legal oversight, the paper said.</p>

<p>The ministry has also asked the Pakistani government to find ways to prevent beggars from travelling to Saudi Arabia under the guise of religious pilgrimage.</p>

<p>In May, the Saudi government issued a fatwa, or edict, prohibiting Hajj without a permit. It fixed a penalty of 10,000 Riyals (around Rs 2.22 lakh) and deportation for the violating visitors.</p>

<p>In September last year, 16 beggars disguised as pilgrims were offloaded from a Saudi Arabia-bound flight and arrested for trying to travel to the Gulf Kingdom to indulge in begging.</p>

<p>According to a report last year, 90 per cent of <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/majority-of-beggars-arrested-abroad-are-from-crisis-hit-pakistan-report-4435362" target="_blank">beggars arrested in foreign countries belong to Pakistan</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[An Israeli airstrike on Beirut on Tuesday killed Ibrahim Qubaisi, the head of Hezbollah's missile division. The cross-border firing between Israel and Hezbollah continued as the Iran-backed militant group fired over 300 rockets towards Israel.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="CetSht_cn">
<ol class="CetSht_ol">
	<li class="CetSht_li">Ibrahim Qubaisi, Hezbollah's commander in charge of its rocket and missile forces, was killed in an Israeli airstrike in the Dahiyeh suburb of Beirut. The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed his death, stating that Qubaisi had been a central figure in Hezbollah's missile capabilities for decades.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">The airstrike followed intense cross-border clashes between Hezbollah and Israel, with the militant group launching approximately 300 rockets at northern Israeli cities including Haifa, Safed, and Nazareth. Israeli air raid sirens were triggered across the Galilee region.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">In addition to Qubaisi, the IDF claimed that at least two other high-ranking Hezbollah commanders were eliminated in the strike. These leaders were involved in Hezbollah's missile operations, which have increasingly posed a threat to Israel.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Hezbollah acknowledged Qubaisi's death, releasing a statement describing him as a martyr "on the road to Jerusalem," a term they use for fighters killed by Israeli forces.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">A veteran of Hezbollah, Qubaisi joined the group in the 1980s. Over the years, he commanded various missile and rocket units, including the precision-guided missile program, and was deeply involved in Hezbollah's military strategy against Israel. He had close ties with senior military leaders within the group.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Qubaisi played a key role in Hezbollah's 2000 Mount Dov operation, which involved the abduction of three Israeli soldiers. The soldiers were later found dead, and their bodies were returned in a 2004 prisoner exchange. His involvement in that high-profile attack cemented his status within Hezbollah's military wing.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">The Lebanese Health Ministry reported that the airstrike on the Dahiyeh suburb also killed six civilians and injured 15 others. This is part of a broader escalation that has claimed hundreds of lives in Lebanon in recent days, mostly due to Israeli airstrikes.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Tuesday's missile exchange follows a surge in violence between Israel and Hezbollah since the outbreak of the Gaza war in October 2023. There are growing concerns that this could spiral into a full-blown war involving multiple fronts in the Middle East, drawing in Iran-backed groups from Yemen and Iraq.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned that Lebanon is on the brink of disaster, while US President Joe Biden urged both sides to avoid escalating the conflict.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu remained defiant, vowing to continue striking Hezbollah's military targets in Lebanon. "We will continue to hit Hezbollah," Netanyahu declared, stating that any home sheltering missiles would be destroyed.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[It took nearly a century to discover a total of 430 figurative Nazca geoglyphs, which offer significant insights into the ancient cultures at the Nazca Pampa.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Scientists have always been perplexed by the Nazca Lines, ancient designs etched into the southern Peruvian desert, since they were found almost a century ago. Researchers have just discovered 303 more of these enigmatic figures, adding even more enigma to the mysterious location, thanks to artificial intelligence.</p>

<p>Among the recently found geoglyphs are a number of interesting patterns. While some might be easily identifiable, others might not seem to be. Researchers discovered that some of the pictures resemble killer whales with knives, cats, camels, and even in the shape of the popular Pixar robot character Wall-E. Some photos only acquire an otherworldly aspect that adds more mystery to these extremely ancient pieces of art.</p>

<p>The Nazca Lines have a purpose and meaning that have puzzled researchers for years now, dating back about 400 BC. In this respect, though the meaning of such is unknown, the recently found geoglyphs contribute to adding evidence on how just artistic and ingenious the people of Nazca were.</p>

<p>A joint effort involving scientists at the IBM Thomas J Watson Research Centre in New York and Yamagata University in Japan revealed the discovery, which was published in the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2407652121"><em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.</em></a> Through the use of artificial intelligence (AI), they were able to decipher patterns concealed beneath the sands of the Nazca Desert that had never been seen before.</p>

<p>According to a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2407652121">release</a>, after training the model on images of existing geoglyphs, the research team used it to look for more. They found 303 that they were able to confirm through site visits by human experts.</p>

<p>As expected, many of the lines comprising the newly found geoglyphs were faint, but the researchers could discern what they depict, mainly humans and domesticated animals, though some were abstract, such as a knife-wielding killer whale. The team plans to continue using the AI app to search for more examples of the ancient art.</p>

<p>Such a discovery is more than sure to reinvigorate interest in the Nazca Lines and encourage further research into the ancient civilisation that created them.</p>

<p><strong>What are Nazca Lines?</strong></p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.livescience.com/archaeology/knife-wielding-orca-and-alien-looking-figures-among-300-nazca-lines-discovered-in-groundbreaking-ai-study"><em>Live Science</em></a>, the Nazca Lines are a group of large human-carved geoglyphs located in a roughly 170-square-mile (440 square kilometres) area of Peru's Nazca Desert. The ancient artworks were likely created between 200 B.C. and A.D. 500 by members of the pre-Incan civilisation, known as the Nazca (or Nasca), who removed the upper layers of the desert's red-tinged surface pebbles to reveal sections of lighter soil in a wide range of different shapes and sizes. Researchers had already found around 430 Nazca Lines since the mysterious shapes were rediscovered by aeroplane passengers in the 1920s. Most of these geoglyphs were identified in the last 20 years with the help of advancements in satellite imagery.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Trump's campaign said that intelligence officials have identified that Iranian threats have "heightened in the past few months".]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump was briefed on Tuesday by US intelligence officials on alleged threats from Iran to assassinate him, Trump's campaign said.</p>

<p>"President Trump was briefed earlier today by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) regarding real and specific threats from Iran to assassinate him in an effort to destabilize and sow chaos in the United States," the campaign said in a statement.</p>

<p>The campaign said that intelligence officials have identified that Iranian threats have "heightened in the past few months" and US government officials were working to protect Trump and ensure the elections were not impacted.</p>

<p>Iran has previously denied US claims of interfering in American affairs. Iran's permanent mission to the United Nations in New York and the ODNI did not immediately respond to requests for comment late on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, a Pakistani man with alleged ties to Iran pleaded not guilty to charges stemming from an alleged plot to assassinate an American politician in retaliation for the 2020 killing by the U.S. of Iranian military commander Qassem Soleimani.</p>

<p>The defendant named Trump as a potential target but had not conceived the scheme as a plan to assassinate the former president, according to a person familiar with the matter.</p>

<p>Federal authorities are separately probing an apparent assassination attempt on Trump at his Florida golf course in mid-September and a July 13 shooting of the Republican presidential candidate at a rally in Pennsylvania. There has been no indication of Iranian involvement in either of those.</p>

<p>US government agencies said last week that Iranian hackers sent emails containing stolen material from the Republican former president's campaign to people involved in Democratic President Joe Biden's then re-election campaign, part of an alleged broader effort by Tehran to influence the US election.</p>

<p>Biden stepped aside as candidate in late July and was replaced by Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris, who faces Trump in a tight race for the November 5 US elections.</p>

<p>In August, the United States accused Iran of launching cyber operations against the campaigns of both US presidential candidates. Iran denied the allegations.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar held "productive and deep" conversations with his United Arab Emirates counterpart Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan on India and UAE's "ever-growing" comprehensive strategic ties and discussed regional and global issues.</p>

<p>Mr Jaishankar, who was in the UAE on Sunday, visited the iconic BAPS Hindu Mandir in Abu Dhabi and participated in the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/universal-practice-s-jaishankar-leads-yoga-day-celebrations-in-abu-dhabi-5954962">10th International Yoga Day celebrations</a> before meeting Al Nahyan.</p>

<p>"Very pleased to meet UAE FM @ABZayed today in Abu Dhabi," he said in a post on X after meeting his UAE counterpart.</p>

<p>"Productive and deep conversations on our ever-growing Comprehensive Strategic Partnership. Appreciated the discussion and his insights on regional and global issues," he said.</p>

<p>Mr Jaishankar visited the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/explained-how-abu-dhabis-baps-hindu-temple-represents-india-uae-ties-5057457">BAPS Hindu Mandir in Abu Dhabi</a>, which was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on February 14 this year.</p>

<p>Taking to X, he called the temple a "visible symbol of India-UAE friendship".</p>

<p>At the temple, the minister interacted with the monks of BAPS, the Bochasanwasi Akshar Purushottam Sansthan, the organisation that built the temple on the land donated by the UAE.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Mr Jaishankar then inaugurated and participated in the 10th International Day of Yoga celebrations organised by the Indian Embassy in UAE, held at the Louvre, Abu Dhabi museum premises.</p>

<p>The session lasted for almost 30 minutes, with participants from a multitude of countries at the museum that regularly holds yoga classes for diverse backgrounds.</p>

<p>Ahead of his day-long visit to Abu Dhabi, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) in New Delhi said that the visit would provide an opportunity to review the entire spectrum of comprehensive strategic partnership between India and the UAE as well as regional and global developments.</p>

<p>"During the visit, the External Affairs Minister will have a meeting with his UAE counterpart on wide-ranging issues of the partnership," the MEA said in a statement.</p>

<p>About a 3.5-million-strong and vibrant Indian community forms the largest expatriate group in the UAE.</p>

<p>Both countries signed a landmark comprehensive economic partnership agreement (CEPA) in February 2022 to boost economic engagement.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[More than 15 people, including policemen and a priest, were killed and several others injured after unidentified gunmen opened fire at a synagogue, a church, and a police post in Russia's North Caucasus region of Dagestan on Sunday.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At least 15 people, including policemen and a priest, were killed and several others injured after unidentified gunmen opened fire at synagogues, churches, and a police post in Russia's North Caucasus region of Dagestan on Sunday, the region's governor said.</p>

<p>The simultaneous attacks occurred in Dagestan's largest city of Makhachkala and in the coastal city of Derbent with Governor Sergei Melikov calling it a "terrorist attack".</p>

<p>Officials said that the police personnel had killed four gunmen in Makhachkala and two in Derbent.</p>

<p>Melikov said that among the dead, in addition to the police officers, were several civilians, including an Orthodox priest who had worked in Derbent for more than 40 years.</p>

<p>"This evening in Derbent and Makhachkala unknown (attackers) made attempts to destabilise the situation in society,"&nbsp;Melikov wrote on Telegram.</p>

<p>"We know who is behind these terrorist attacks and what objective they are pursuing," he added later, without specifying but referring to the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/brazil-china-call-for-russia-ukraine-peace-talks-with-both-countries-5732561" target="_blank">Russia-Ukraine war</a>.</p>

<p>"We must understand that war comes to our homes too. We felt it, but today we face it," he said.</p>

<p>Melikov said the "active phase" of operations in Derbent and Makhachkala had ended and that "six bandits have been liquidated".</p>

<p>The authorities will try to find "all the members of these sleeper cells who prepared (the attacks) and who were prepared, including abroad", he added.</p>

<p>He also said that June 24-26 have been declared days of mourning in Dagestan, with flags lowered to half-staff and all entertainment events cancelled.</p>

<p>Russia's Investigative Committee said it had opened criminal probes over "acts of terror" in Dagestan. There, however, was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attacks.</p>

<p>Russia's state media cited law enforcement as saying that among the attackers had been two sons of the head of central Dagestan's Sergokala district, who had been detained.</p>

<p>In Derbent, authorities were quoted as saying that both the synagogue and church were set on fire.</p>

<p>The incident comes three months after 145 people were killed in an attack claimed by the Islamic State on a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/russia-accuses-ukraine-of-direct-involvement-in-deadly-concert-hall-attack-5734004" target="_blank">concert hall near Moscow</a>, Russia's worst terrorist attack in years.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Two years after the US Supreme Court stripped constitutional protections for abortion, the explosive issue will feature prominently in Thursday's debate between Joe Biden and Donald Trump -- with the Republican under pressure not to alienate voters.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two years after the US Supreme Court stripped constitutional protections for abortion, the explosive issue will feature prominently in Thursday's debate between Joe Biden and Donald Trump -- with the Republican under pressure not to alienate voters.</p>

<p>On June 24, 2022, the high court -- with a super-conservative majority built under Trump's presidency -- overturned the historic ruling in Roe v. Wade that had protected abortion rights, placing the issue in the hands of the states.</p>

<p>That same day, a handful of US states banned abortions, forcing clinics to close in haste or move to more welcoming places.</p>

<p>The nation, already politically polarized, is now split between the states that have banned or significantly restricted access to the procedure -- and the states that have adopted new protections for a woman's right to terminate a pregnancy.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court's decision sent political shockwaves across the country, and had repercussions -- since the ruling, conservatives have lost nearly every referendum or vote revolving around abortion access.</p>

<p>And some of those losses came in states that have recently shifted solidly to the right, such as Ohio, Alabama and Kansas.</p>

<h3><strong>Kamala Harris takes the baton&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Since Roe was overturned, "the abortion rights movement discovered that Americans care more about abortion rights than may have been anticipated," said Mary Ziegler, a professor at the University of California, Davis law school.</p>

<p>"And so they are trying to capitalize on that in ballot initiative fights that have gone mostly the way of the abortion rights movement," she told AFP.</p>

<p>Democrats are making the most of the moment, hoping to win some crucial support from women and young voters.</p>

<p>Biden, a practicing Catholic who was long vexed by the issue, has become a champion of abortion rights and made it a defining part of his re-election bid, winning the backing of several family planning organizations.</p>

<p>Vice President Kamala Harris, the first woman in the job, has crisscrossed the country for months to mobilize her party faithful.</p>

<p>The 59-year-old Harris in March became the first vice president to visit a clinic performing abortions, in Minnesota.</p>

<p>On Monday, she will hold an event in Arizona -- a state seen as a crucial battleground in the November presidential election, and one where the supreme court said a Civil War-era rule banning abortion was valid.</p>

<p>Democratic Governor Katie Hobbs later signed a repeal of the 1864 law.</p>

<p>Across the country, Democrats have also encouraged the organization of mini-referendums on abortion in key states, so that they will coincide with the presidential vote -- and hopefully motivate unenthused voters to cast ballots.</p>

<h3><strong>Trump deliberately vague&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Democrats are right to be confident in their reasoning, if an avalanche of opinion polls are correct.</p>

<p>According to a Fox News poll published Wednesday, 47 percent of voters consider abortion to be "extremely important" in how they decide between Biden and Trump.</p>

<p>The presumptive Republican candidate, who often mentions that he nominated three Supreme Court justices who helped to overturn Roe v. Wade, has lately been decidedly vague on the issue of abortion.</p>

<p>"You must follow your heart on this issue but remember, you must also win elections," Trump said in a video message in early April.</p>

<p>He has not campaigned on any promise to make abortion illegal with federal legislation, as the religious right has lobbied him to do.</p>

<p>"The best you can do if your position is unpopular is to not clarify your position," Ziegler says.</p>

<p>Biden, whose approval rating is less than stellar, will almost certainly attack Trump on the issue when the two take the stage Thursday for their first debate in 2024.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Several buildings, including a police station and a town hall, were set on fire in New Caledonia overnight, authorities said Monday, as the French Pacific territory was hit by a fresh surge of unrest.</p>

<p>"The night was... marked by unrest throughout the mainland and on the island of Pins and Mare, requiring the intervention of numerous reinforcements: with attacks on the police, arson and roadblocks", the High Commission, which represents the French state in the archipelago, said in a press release.</p>

<p>Rioting and looting erupted in New Caledonia in mid-May over an electoral reform plan that Indigenous Kanak people feared would leave them in a permanent minority, putting independence hopes definitively out of reach.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The unrest left nine dead and damage estimated at more than 1.5 billion euros ($1.6 billion).</p>

<p>The French government responded by sending more than 3,000 troops and police to the territory almost 17,000 kilometres (10,600 miles) from Paris.</p>

<p>In Dumbea, north of the capital Noumea, the municipal police station and a garage were set alight. Four armoured vehicles intervened, an AFP journalist said.</p>

<p>Several fires broke out in the Ducos and Magenta districts of Noumea, while police and separatists clashed in Bourail, resulting in one injury, AFP learned.</p>

<p>The High Commission reported "several fires were extinguished", particularly in Ducos and Magenta, adding that "the premises and vehicles of the municipal police and private vehicles" were set on fire.</p>

<p>"Abuses, destruction and attempted fires were also committed in several places in Paita," in the Noumea suburbs, added the High Commission, which said police in Mare had also been attacked.</p>

<p>On Monday morning, many schools were closed due to the renewed unrest.</p>

<p>On Saturday, seven independence activists linked to a group accused of orchestrating the riots last month were indicted and sent to mainland France for pre-trial detention.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin's mutual defence agreement with North Korea has the potential to create friction with China, which has long been the reclusive state's main ally, the top U.S. military officer said on Sunday.</p>

<p>"We've got someone else who's kind of nudging in now, so that may drive a little bit more friction between (China) and Russia," Air Force General C.Q. Brown, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters during an overseas trip.</p>

<p>"So it'll be interesting to see how these three countries -- how this plays out."</p>

<p>Analysts said the pact, signed on Wednesday, could undercut Beijing's leverage over its two neighbors and any heightened instability could be negative for China's global economic and strategic ambitions.</p>

<p>On Thursday, Putin said Russia might supply weapons to North Korea in what he suggested would be a mirror response to the Western arming of Ukraine.</p>

<p>Brown acknowledged U.S. concern about the deal.</p>

<p>But he also tempered those remarks by noting apparent limitations to the accord and expressing doubt Moscow would give North Korea "everything" it wanted.</p>

<p>U.S. officials have said they believe North Korea is keen to acquire fighter aircraft, surface-to-air missiles, armored vehicles, ballistic missile production equipment or materials, and other advanced technologies from Russia.</p>

<p>"The feedback I have on the agreement -- it was a broad agreement that's not overly binding, which gives you an indication (that) they want to work together but they don't want to get their hands tied," Brown said.</p>

<p>The treaty signed by Putin and Kim on Wednesday commits each side to provide immediate military assistance to the other in the event of armed aggression against either one of them.</p>

<p>Putin has said Moscow expected that its cooperation with North Korea would serve as a deterrent to the West, but that there was no need to use North Korean soldiers for the war in Ukraine.</p>

<p>The United States and Ukraine say North Korea has already provided Russia with significant quantities of artillery shells and ballistic missiles, which Moscow and Pyongyang deny.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a tragic incident, a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/32-year-old-man-from-andhra-pradesh-killed-in-us-grocery-store-shooting-5950446">32-year-old Indian man</a> was fatally shot during a robbery at a convenience store in the US state of Texas. Dasari Gopikrishna, who hailed from Bapatla district in Andhra Pradesh, came to the US only eight months ago.</p>

<p>The incident occurred at a gas station convenience store in Pleasant Grove, Dallas on June 21.</p>

<p>Consul General D C Manjunath, who was in Dallas for a Yoga Day event on Sunday, confirmed to news agency PTI that the incident was unrelated to a shooting in Arkansas as previously reported by various sources.</p>

<p>Expressing condolences to Gopikrishna's family, Mr Manjunath said, "We are deeply saddened to learn about the tragic demise of Indian national Gopi Krishna Dasari in a robbery shooting incident at Pleasant Grove, Dallas, TX, and are in touch with local family members."&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Consulate, along with support from Indian associations, is providing all possible assistance to facilitate the repatriation of Mr Gopikrishna's body to India following local formalities, including autopsy and death certificates.</p>

<p>Mr Gopikrishna sustained critical injuries during the robbery and was rushed to a nearby hospital, where he tragically succumbed to his injuries on Sunday morning while undergoing treatment.</p>

<p>The incident has deeply affected the Indian community in Dallas and surrounding areas. Mr Gopikrishna is survived by his wife and son.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russia on Sunday said the United States had responsibility for a Ukrainian missile attack on Russian-annexed Crimea, which it said killed four people, including two children, and wounded over 100.</p>

<p>A missile exploded above a beach area of the city of Sevastopol, firing shrapnel at people relaxing there, Russian-appointed officials said.</p>

<p>Russia's defence ministry said Washington and Kyiv bore "responsibility for a deliberate missile strike on peaceful residents", which it said used US-supplied ATACMS missiles.</p>

<p>Sevastopol governor Mikhail Razvozhayev initially said in a Telegram video the attack had killed three children and two adults, and wounded nearly 120 people.</p>

<p>He later revised the toll to four dead and 151 people requiring medical care, of whom 82 had been hospitalised.</p>

<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin had called to "offer his condolences", Razvozhayev added.</p>

<p>The Black Sea port city and naval base on the Crimean peninsula was annexed by Russia in 2014 but is still internationally recognised as part of Ukraine.</p>

<p>Sevastopol regularly comes under fire from Ukraine but Sunday's attack was unusually deadly. Razvozhayev said the attack hit Uchkuyevka, an area with sandy beaches and hotels.</p>

<p>Videos posted on social media showed people running from the beach as explosions went off and people in swimming outfits carrying a stretcher. AFP could not verify their authenticity.</p>

<p>A local news channel on Telegram, ChP Sevastopol, cited witnesses as saying that an elderly woman was killed as she swam in the sea.</p>

<p>Washington said in April that it had provided longer-range ATACMS missile systems to Kyiv, which had long urged allies for weapons allowing it to strike Russia farther beyond the front lines.</p>

<p>Neither the United States nor Ukraine had commented on the Sevastopol strike.</p>

<h3><strong>'Terrorist act'</strong></h3>

<p>The investigative committee, which probes major crimes, said it was opening an investigation into "a terrorist act".</p>

<p>The governor said Ukraine had launched five missiles that Russian air-defences intercepted over the sea but fragments fell onto the shore, wounding people.</p>

<p>Razvozhayev said shrapnel hit beach areas in the north of the city and set fire to a house and woodland.</p>

<p>A Russian defence ministry statement said Ukraine had committed a "terrorist attack on the civilian infrastructure of Sevastopol with US-supplied ATACMS tactical missiles loaded with cluster warheads".</p>

<p>The ministry said four missiles were downed but a fifth changed trajectory after being intercepted "with its warhead exploding in the air over the city".</p>

<p>It added that "all flight missions for US ATACMS are entered by US specialists based on the US's own satellite reconnaissance data.</p>

<p>"Such actions will not be left without a response," the ministry said.</p>

<p>Ukraine's military has not commented on the attack, which came a day after a Russian guided bomb strike on the city of Kharkiv hit an apartment building, killing two people and wounding more than 50.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Deaths in Belgorod, Russia</strong></h3>

<p>On Sunday, Russian strikes hit a house and a children's educational facility in Kharkiv, killing one person and injuring 10 including two teenagers, regional governor Oleg Synegubov said.</p>

<p>In the Belgorod region on Sunday, three Ukrainian attack drones struck Graivoron, near the border with Ukraine, said governor Vyacheslav Gladkov, with one hitting a car park near a multi-storey block of flats.</p>

<p>"A peaceful civilian was killed. The man died from his wounds at the spot" and three people were wounded, Gladkov wrote on Telegram.</p>

<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a social media post urged supporter countries to help Ukraine step up attacks on Russian soil.</p>

<p>"We have enough determination to destroy terrorists on their territory -- it is only fair -- and we need the same determination from our partners. We can stop Russia," Zelensky wrote.</p>

<p>In his evening address he added: "The recent approval of strikes on Russian territory -- near the border -- made it possible to destroy part of Russia's terrorist potential."</p>

<p>But, he said, "we need more long-range weapons, we need appropriate weapons for Ukrainians".</p>

<p>Ukraine's energy operator Ukrenergo announced that rolling electricity blackouts would be imposed nationwide throughout Monday because of increased Russian attacks on power stations.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A drone attack damaged a merchant ship in the Red Sea near Yemen Sunday, two maritime security agencies said, as Iran-backed Houthi rebels announced naval attacks in the vital trade route.</p>

<p>Vessels in and around the Red Sea have come under repeated attack for months by Yemen's Houthi rebels. They say they are acting in support of Palestinians during the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip.</p>

<p>The latest attack occurred about 65 nautical miles (120 kilometres) west of the Yemeni port city of Hodeida, said the United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO), which is run by Britain's Royal Navy.</p>

<p>"The Master of a merchant vessel reports being hit by uncrewed aerial system (UAS), resulting in damage to the vessel," said a bulletin from the agency.</p>

<p>The "vessel is proceeding to its next port of call" and initially reporting no casualties, it added. "Authorities are investigating."</p>

<p>British maritime security firm Ambrey said the vessel was "a Liberia-flagged, Greece-owned bulk carrier".&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Joint Maritime Information Centre (JMIC), working with a Western-led naval task force in the region, said it was "the second time the vessel was targeted" after missiles were fired at it earlier on its voyage through the Gulf of Aden.</p>

<p>"While transiting in the Red Sea, the vessel reported being hit... Several members of the crew sustained non-life threatening injuries that do not require immediate medical attention," the centre said.</p>

<p>"JMIC has investigated and assessed this vessel was targeted due to other vessels within its company structure making port calls in Israel."</p>

<h3><strong>Flooded vessel abandoned</strong></h3>

<p>Later on Sunday, UKMTO said it received a distress call from a second vessel, this one off Yemen's southeastern coast, that had "suffered flooding that cannot be contained".</p>

<p>UKMTO did not specify what caused the incident.</p>

<p>"This has forced the master and crew to abandon the ship. They have been recovered by an assisting ship," UKMTO said in an incident report, adding that the flooded vessel "remains adrift".</p>

<p>The Houthis' military spokesman Yahya Saree said in a statement on Sunday that the rebel forces had targeted two ships, one in the Red Sea and the other in the Indian Ocean.</p>

<p>He said "a second targeting operation" against a vessel called Transworld Navigator used an UAS and "led to a direct hit".</p>

<p>A second vessel was targeted "with a number of cruise missiles".</p>

<p>On Saturday, United States Central Command, which has carried out retaliatory strikes against Houthi targets over their attacks on shipping, said it had destroyed three nautical drones belonging to the group over the previous 24 hours.</p>

<p>"It was determined these systems presented an imminent threat to US, coalition forces, and merchant vessels in the region," Central Command said.</p>

<p>It also said the rebels had launched three anti-ship missiles into the Gulf of Aden, but no injuries or significant damage were reported.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Mr Jaishankar, along with Indian Ambassador to UAE, Sunjay Sudhir, led the Yoga Day celebrations at the Louvre Abu Dhabi.</p>

<p>In a post on X, Mr Jaishankar stated, "Joined international yoga enthusiasts @LouvreAbuDhabi as we celebrate the #InternationalDayofYoga 2024 in the UAE."</p>

<p>In his remarks before performing Yoga, Mr Jaishankar noted that Yoga is an Indian tradition but it has now become a truly universal practice. He stated that International Day of Yoga has acted as a motivation, as a magnet, as a method of really gathering people, spreading the practice, actually in a way keeping the planet happier, healthier, more connected.</p>

<p>Jaishankar said, "I am really very happy to be able to join so many of you today in Abu Dhabi. I happen to be here today and I heard about the event and I agree with you that Yoga is an Indian tradition but I think it has now become a truly universal practice."</p>

<p>"We are very pleased to see in the last 10 years how the International Day of Yoga has acted as a motivation, as a magnet, as a method of really gathering people, spreading the practice, actually in a way keeping the planet happier, healthier, more connected. So, it's really for me a great pleasure to join you all this evening," he added.</p>

<p>This year marked the 10th anniversary of the International Day of Yoga on June 21. In December 2014, the United Nations unanimously adopted a resolution proposed by India to celebrate the International Day of Yoga on June 21 which is the Summer Solstice, the longest day of the year in the Northern Hemisphere.</p>

<p>Mr Jaishankar, who is on an official visit to the UAE, visited the BAPS Hindu Mandir in Abu Dhabi on Sunday. He said that the temple is a true cultural bridge between India and the UAE.</p>

<p>Following his visit to the temple, Mr Jaishankar in a post on X wrote, "Blessed to visit the BAPS Hindu Mandir in Abu Dhabi today. A visible symbol of India-UAE friendship, it radiates a positive message to the world and is a true cultural bridge between our two countries."</p>

<p>In a statement, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said that "this visit will provide an opportunity to review the entire spectrum of comprehensive strategic partnerships between India and UAE and regional and global developments."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Eight Palestinians were killed on Sunday in an Israeli airstrike on a training college near Gaza City being used to distribute aid, Palestinian witnesses said, as Israeli tanks pushed further into the southern city of Rafah.</p>

<p>The strike hit part of a vocational college run by the U.N. Palestinian refugee agency UNRWA that is now providing aid to displaced families, the witnesses said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Some people were coming to receive coupons and others had been displaced from their houses and they were sheltering here. Some were filling up water, others were receiving coupons, and suddenly we heard something falling. We ran away, those who were carrying water let it spill," said Mohammed Tafesh, one of the witnesses.</p>

<p>A Reuters photographer saw a low-rise building completely demolished and bodies wrapped in blankets laid out beside the road, waiting to be taken away.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We pulled out martyrs (from beneath the rubble), one who used to sell cold drinks and another who used to sell pastries and others who distributed or received coupons," Tafesh said. "There are about four or five martyrs and 10 injured. Thank God, the condition of the injured is good."</p>

<p>The Israeli military said the site, which it said had served in the past as a UNRWA headquarters, has been used by Hamas and Islamic Jihad operatives. It added that precautionary measures were taken before the strike to reduce the risk of harming civilians.</p>

<p>"This morning (Sunday), IAF fighter jets directed by IDF and ISA intelligence struck terrorist infrastructure in which Hamas and Islamic Jihad terrorists were operating," the military said in a statement.</p>

<p>"This is another example of Hamas' systematic exploitation of civilian infrastructure and the civilian population as a human shield for its terrorist activities," it added.</p>

<p>Hamas denies Israeli accusations it uses civilians as human shields or uses civilian facilities for military purposes.</p>

<p>Juliette Touma, UNRWA's Director of Communications, said the agency was looking into the details of the reported attack before providing more information.</p>

<p>"Since the beginning of the war, we have recorded that nearly 190 of our buildings have been hit. This is the vast majority of our buildings in Gaza," she said. A total of 193 UNRWA team members have been killed in the conflict, she added.</p>

<h3><strong>'Intense Phase' Ending</strong></h3>

<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday that the phase of intense fighting against Hamas in the Gaza Strip would end "very soon" but that the war would not end until the Islamist group no longer controls the Palestinian enclave.</p>

<p>"After the intense phase is finished, we will have the possibility to move part of the forces north. And we will do this," Netanyahu said in an interview with Israel's Channel 14.</p>

<p>Israel's fighting against Iran-backed Hezbollah has escalated on the northern border with Lebanon, where many Israeli towns have been evacuated. Netanyahu said a northern deployment would allow residents to come home.</p>

<h3><strong>Advance Into Rafah</strong></h3>

<p>More than eight months into Israel's war in the Hamas-administered Palestinian enclave, its advance is focused on the two areas its forces have yet to seize - Rafah on Gaza's southern tip and the area surrounding Deir al-Balah in the centre.</p>

<p>Israel's ground and air campaign in Gaza was triggered when Hamas stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, killing around 1,200 people and seizing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.</p>

<p>The offensive has killed almost 37,600 people, according to Palestinian health authorities, and left Gaza in ruins .</p>

<p>Residents said Israeli tanks had advanced to the edge of the Mawasi displaced persons' camp in the northwest of Rafah in fierce fighting with Hamas-led fighters, part of a push into western and northern Rafah in which they had blown up dozens of houses in recent days.</p>

<p>"The fighting with the resistance has been intense. The occupation forces are overlooking the Mawasi area now, which forced families there to head for Khan Younis," said one resident, who asked not to be named, on a chat app.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said it was continuing "intelligence-based, targeted operations" in the Rafah area and had located weapons stores and tunnel shafts, and killed Palestinian gunmen.</p>

<p>The armed wings of Hamas and the Islamic Jihad movement said their fighters had attacked Israeli forces in Rafah with anti-tank rockets and mortar bombs and pre-planted explosive devices.</p>

<p>Another strike killed two people in Nuseirat in central Gaza.</p>

<p>In Beit Lahiya in the northern Gaza Strip, health officials at Kamal Adwan Hospital said two babies had died of malnutrition, taking the number of children who have died of malnutrition or dehydration since Oct. 7 to at least 31, a number that health officials say reflects under-recording.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Apple is talking to major rival Meta about integrating the Facebook parent company's generative AI into its products, as it tries to catch up with rivals on artificial intelligence, the Wall Street Journal reported Sunday.</p>

<p>The report comes after Apple also struck a deal with OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, to help equip its Apple Intelligence suite of new AI features for its coveted products.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For months, pressure has been on Apple to persuade doubters on its AI strategy, after Microsoft and Google rolled out products in rapid-fire succession.</p>

<p>It has developed its own, smaller artificial intelligence but said that it will turn to others such as OpenAI to boost its in-house offering.</p>

<p>According to the Journal, which cited sources close to the matter, Meta has held discussions with Apple over integrating its own generative AI model into Apple Intelligence.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Apple senior vice president of software engineering Craig Federighi said in early June that Apple also wanted to integrate capabilities from Google's generative AI system, Gemini, into its devices.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The big challenge for Apple has been how to infuse ChatGPT-style AI -- which voraciously feeds off data -- into its products without weakening its heavily promoted user privacy and security, according to analysts.</p>

<p>Apple Intelligence will enable users to create their own emojis based on a description in everyday language, or to generate brief summaries of e-mails in the mailbox.</p>

<p>Apple said Siri, its voice assistant, will also get an AI-infused upgrade and now will appear as a pulsating light on the edge of your home screen.</p>

<p>Launched over 12 years ago, Siri has long since been seen as a dated feature, overtaken by the new generation of assistants, such as GPT-4o, OpenAI's latest offering.</p>

<p>According to Canalys, 16 percent of smartphones shipped this year will be equipped with generative AI features, a proportion it expects to rise to 54 percent by 2028.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday that the Israeli military's heavy fighting against Hamas in the southern Gaza city of Rafah is nearly over.</p>

<p>"The intense phase of the fighting against Hamas is about to end," he said in an interview with Israel's pro-Netanyahu Channel 14.</p>

<p>"It doesn't mean that the war is about to end, but the war in its intense phase is about to end in Rafah," he said.</p>

<p>"After the end of the intense phase, we will be able to redeploy some forces to the north, and we will do that. Primarily for defensive purposes but also to bring the (displaced) residents back home," Netanyahu said in his first interview with an Israeli network since the start of the war with Hamas on October 7.</p>

<p>Netanyahu said he would not agree to any deal that stipulates an end to the war in Gaza, indicating that he was open to a "partial" deal that would facilitate the return of some hostages still held in Gaza, if not all.</p>

<p>"The goal is to return the kidnapped and uproot the Hamas regime in Gaza," he said.</p>

<p>United States officials have raised doubts over Israel's goal of completely eliminating Hamas, and on Wednesday Israel's top army spokesman, Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, said: "To say that we are going to make Hamas disappear is to throw sand in people's eyes."</p>

<p>He said Hamas is an ideology and "we cannot eliminate an ideology."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Indian missions in Canadian capital Ottawa and Toronto city on Sunday marked the 39th anniversary of the 1985 Kanishka bombing in which 329 persons, including 86 children, on board an Air India lost their lives in one of the most heinous terror-related air disasters in the history of civil aviation.</p>

<p>High Commissioner Sanjay Kumar Verma paid homage to the victims of Air India flight 182 Kanishka on the 39th anniversary of the "cowardly terrorist bombing", the High Commission in Ottawa posted on X along with a series of photographs from the event.</p>

<p>Addressing the gathering, Mr Verma said, "No government in the world should overlook the threat of terrorism emanating from its territories for political gains. Human lives are much more important than the transitory political interests. All terrorist activities should be met with exemplary legal and social actions, before they start harming the larger humanity. Governments, security agencies, and international organisations must work in concert to dismantle terrorist networks, disrupt their financing, and counter their twisted ideologies."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Family members and friends of the victims, Canadian government officials, including Royal Canadian Mounted Police Assistant Commissioner, Ireland envoy and more than 150 members of the Indo-Canadian community attended the solemn occasion, the High Commission said.</p>

<p>"India shares the sorrow and pain of the victims' near &amp; dear ones. India stands at the forefront of countering the menace of terrorism and works closely with all nations to tackle this global threat," it said.</p>

<p>The Montreal-New Delhi Air India 'Kanishka' Flight 182 exploded 45 minutes before it was supposed to land at London's Heathrow Airport on June 23, 1985, killing all 329 people on board, most of them Canadians of Indian descent.</p>

<p>The bombing was blamed on Sikh separatists in retaliation to 'Operation Bluestar' to flush out separatists from the Golden Temple in 1984.</p>

<p>The Indian mission in Toronto also marked the day.</p>

<p>"Consul General Siddhartha Nath laid a wreath at the Air India 182 memorial, Humber Park, Etobicoke in solemn remembrance of the 329 victims of the terrorist bombing of AI 182 on this day, 39 years ago," the Consulate General of India in Toronto posted on X along with a photograph.</p>

<p>In another post on X, the mission said the Consul General also attended the memorial service held at Queen's Park Toronto for the victims and met with the bereaved families.</p>

<p>"In his remarks he highlighted the importance of unified global efforts to combat terrorism and standing firm against its glorification," it said, sharing a series of photographs.</p>

<p>Earlier in the day, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar in a post on X paid his homage to the memory of the 329 victims of AI 182 'Kanishka' who were killed on this day in 1985.</p>

<p>"Today marks the 39th anniversary of one of the worst acts of terrorism in history," he said.</p>

<p>"My thoughts are with their families. The anniversary is a reminder why terrorism should never be tolerated," Mr Jaishankar wrote.</p>

<p>On Friday, the Canadian police said the investigations into the bombing of the Air India Flight 182 remain "active and ongoing", terming it the "longest" and one of the "most complex domestic terrorism" probes.</p>

<p>In a statement, Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) Assistant Commissioner David Teboul called the bombing the "greatest terror-related loss of life involving and affecting Canadians" in the country's history as he offered "deepest sympathies, understanding and support to the families of the victims".</p>

<p>"The Air India investigation is the longest and certainly one of the most complex domestic terrorism investigations that the RCMP has undertaken in our history," Teboul said. "Our investigative efforts remain active and ongoing," he said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Saudi Arabia said Sunday that more than 1,300 faithful died during the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/bodies-on-the-ground-pilgrims-recount-hajj-heat-horrors-5939407">hajj pilgrimage</a> which took place during intense heat and that most of them who died did not have official permits.</p>

<p>"Regrettably, the number of mortalities reached 1,301, with 83 percent being unauthorised to perform hajj and having walked long distances under direct sunlight, without adequate shelter or comfort," the official Saudi Press Agency reported.</p>

<p>An AFP tally last week, based on official statements and reports from diplomats involved in their countries' responses, put the count at more than 1,100.</p>

<p>The dead came from more than 10 countries stretching from the United States to Indonesia, and some governments are continuing to update their totals.</p>

<p>Arab diplomats told AFP last week that Egyptians accounted for 658 deaths -- 630 of them unregistered pilgrims.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The diplomats said the cause of death in most cases was heat-related.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Temperatures in Mecca this year climbed as high as 51.8 degrees Celsius (125 degrees Fahrenheit), according to Saudi Arabia's national meteorological centre.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Riyadh had not publicly commented on the deaths or provided its own count until Sunday.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On Friday, however, a senior Saudi official gave AFP a partial count of 577 deaths for the two busiest days of hajj: June 15, when pilgrims gathered for hours of prayers in the blazing sun on Mount Arafat, and June 16, when they participated in the "stoning of the devil" ritual in Mina.</p>

<p>The official also defended Riyadh's response, saying: "The state did not fail, but there was a misjudgement on the part of people who did not appreciate the risks."</p>

<h3><strong>'Heat stress'</strong></h3>

<p>The Saudi health minister, Fahd Al-Jalajel, on Sunday described management of the hajj this year as "successful", SPA reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He said the health system "provided more than 465,000 specialised treatment services, including 141,000 services to those who didn't obtain official authorisation to perform hajj," according to SPA, which summarised an interview he gave to the state-affiliated Al-Ekhbariya channel.</p>

<p>Jalajel did not specify how many deaths Saudi officials attributed to heat.</p>

<p>"The health system addressed numerous cases of heat stress this year, with some individuals still under care," SPA reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Among the deceased were several elderly and chronically ill individuals."</p>

<p>The hajj is one of the five pillars of Islam that all Muslims with the means must complete at least once in their lives.</p>

<p>Saudi officials have said 1.8 million pilgrims took part this year, a similar number to last year, and that 1.6 million came from abroad.</p>

<p>For the past several years the mainly outdoor rituals have fallen during the sweltering Saudi summer.</p>

<p>The timing of the hajj moves forward about 11 days each year in the Gregorian calendar, meaning that next year it will take place earlier in June, potentially in cooler conditions.</p>

<p>A 2019 study by the journal Geophysical Research Letters said because of climate change, heat stress for hajj pilgrims will exceed the "extreme danger threshold" from 2047 to 2052 and 2079 to 2086, "with increasing frequency and intensity as the century progresses".</p>

<h3><strong>Off-the-books hajj</strong></h3>

<p>Hajj permits are allocated to countries on a quota system and distributed to individuals by lottery.</p>

<p>Even for those who can obtain them, the steep costs spur many to attempt the hajj without a permit, though they risk arrest and deportation if caught.</p>

<p>Saudi authorities said before the hajj that they had cleared hundreds of thousands of unregistered pilgrims from Mecca.</p>

<p>But the Saudi official who spoke to AFP on Friday said around 400,000 unregistered pilgrims took part, and that "almost all of them (were) from one nationality", an apparent reference to Egypt.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On Saturday, Egyptian Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly ordered 16 tourism companies stripped of their licences and referred their managers to the public prosecutor over illegal pilgrimages to Mecca, Egypt's cabinet said.</p>

<p>It said the rise in the number of deaths of unregistered Egyptian pilgrims stemmed from some companies which "organised the hajj programmes using a personal visit visa, which prevents its holders from entering Mecca" via official channels.</p>

<p>Unregistered pilgrims in many cases did not have access to amenities meant to make the pilgrimage more bearable, including air-conditioned tents.</p>

<p>Unregistered Egyptian pilgrims told AFP last week that in some cases they struggled to access hospitals or hail ambulances for loved ones, some of whom ended up dying.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Teenagers across the Gaza Strip should have been taking their final exams this month, a last hurdle before university and lifelong dreams, but the war in the Palestinian territory has crushed those hopes.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Teenagers across the Gaza Strip should have been taking their final exams this month, a last hurdle before university and lifelong dreams, but the war in the Palestinian territory has crushed those hopes.</p>

<p>According to the education ministry in the Hamas-run Gaza Strip, 85 percent of educational facilities in the territory are out of service because of the war.</p>

<p>"I was eagerly awaiting the exams, but the war prevented that and destroyed that joy", said Baraa al-Farra, an 18-year-old student displaced from Khan Yunis in southern Gaza.</p>

<p>"At first we were waiting in the hope that the war would end and we would catch up," he said.</p>

<p>But "we don't know how long it will last or how many years it will deprive us of our educational lives."</p>

<p>Almost nine months of war in Gaza began with an unprecedented October 7 attack on southern Israel by the Islamist militant group Hamas. The attack resulted in the deaths of 1,194 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 37,598 people, also mostly civilians, according to the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza.</p>

<p>The Education Cluster, a UN-backed organisation, estimated in a report this month that more than 75 percent of Gaza's schools would need full reconstruction or major rehabilitation to reopen.</p>

<p>Many have been turned into shelters for Gaza's displaced and others have been damaged in bombardment.</p>

<p><strong>'Books not bombs'</strong></p>

<p>Liliane Nihad, an 18-year-old displaced to Khan Yunis from Gaza City, in the territory's north, said she and her fellow students had "been waiting 12 years to take these exams and pass and feel happy and enter university... but we have been deprived of all that by this damned war".</p>

<p>Nihad said she had been hoping to study English and to get a doctorate, "but all of that has evaporated".</p>

<p>Displaying their anger at the situation, dozens of students and teachers held a protest in Gaza City's Al-Rimal neighbourhood on Saturday.</p>

<p>"We demand our right to take high school exams" and "We want books, not bombs" they chanted, while empty chairs were laid out to symbolise those students killed in the war.</p>

<p>Mediation has failed to bring an end to the fighting, leaving Gaza's young people with deep uncertainty about their futures.</p>

<p>Farra said he wanted to get out of the territory to achieve his dreams.</p>

<p>"I hope that the crossing will be opened so that I can travel in order to complete my education and not waste my years because I am young and want to achieve my ambitions."</p>

<p>For now, he faces the harsh realities of life under siege.</p>

<p>"I wish I could experience the fatigue of staying up late studying now and not the fatigue of queueing for sweet and salty water" in the territory where clean water is scarce, like many other essentials.</p>

<p><strong>'Psychologically exhausted'</strong></p>

<p>Pupils in the Israeli-occupied West Bank will take the exams, as will those Gazans who managed to escape to neighbouring Egypt.</p>

<p>Even for these pupils, however, the war has been hugely disruptive.</p>

<p>"We are psychologically exhausted and not well prepared" said Muhammad Osama, a student from Gaza's southernmost city of Rafah, after completing his religious studies exam in Cairo.</p>

<p>In the West Bank, violence has further escalated since the start of the Gaza war. According to the Palestinian official news agency Wafa, 20 high school students are among the hundreds of Palestinians killed there.</p>

<p>Wafa reported that 89,000 students from Gaza and the West Bank had been expected to take high school exams this year.</p>

<p>Back in Gaza, however, there will be no exams at all.</p>

<p>The UN, citing the Palestinian ministry of education, said about 39,000 high school students in Gaza are unable to take their tests.</p>

<p>Sulaf Mousa, an 18-year-old from Al-Shati Camp west of Gaza City, hit by a deadly air strike on Saturday, said he had hoped to study medicine and become a doctor.</p>

<p>"Now, we hope we will survive the war and not lose more than we have already lost," Mousa said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Gunmen attacked churches and synagogues in Russia's North Caucasus region of Dagestan on Sunday, killing at least eight police and national guard officers and a priest, officials said.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gunmen attacked churches and synagogues in Russia's North Caucasus region of Dagestan on Sunday, killing at least eight police and national guard officers and a priest, officials said.</p>

<p>The unidentified gunmen launched simultaneous attacks in Dagestan's largest city of Makhachkala and in the coastal city of Derbent.</p>

<p>Russia's Investigative Committee said it had opened criminal probes over "acts of terror" in Dagestan, a largely Muslim region of Russia neighbouring Chechnya.</p>

<p>Russian officials said police had killed four gunmen in Makhachkala and two in Derbent.</p>

<p>"This evening in the cities of Derbent and Makhachkala armed attacks were carried out on two Orthodox churches, a synagogue and a police checkpoint," the National Anti-terrorism Committee said in a statement to RIA Novosti news agency.</p>

<p>"As a result of the terrorist attacks, according to preliminary information, a priest from the Russian Orthodox Church and police officers were killed."</p>

<p>The committee later said the "active" phase of the operation against attackers in Derbent had ended.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In all, six officers were killed and 12 wounded in the attacks, the spokeswoman for Dagestan's interior ministry, Gayana Gariyeva, told RIA Novosti.</p>

<p>The ministry later added that a local police chief had died from his wounds.</p>

<p>Russia's National Guard meanwhile said one of its officers had been killed in Derbent and several others wounded.</p>

<p>In a separate attack, the Dagestan interior ministry said that in a village 65 kilometres (40 miles) from Makhachkala, called Sergokal, gunmen had shot at a police car, wounding one officer.</p>

<p>A law enforcement source said Sergokal district chief was being questioned over his sons' possible involvement in the attacks, RIA Novosti reported.</p>

<p>The Russian Orthodox Church said its archpriest Nikolai Kotelnikov was "brutally killed" in Derbent.</p>

<h3><strong>Synagogues on fire</strong></h3>

<p>Sunday is a religious holiday, Pentecost Sunday, in the Russian Orthodox Church.</p>

<p>Dagestan's interior ministry said 19 people took shelter inside a church in Makhachkala and were later led out to safety.</p>

<p>Gunmen also attacked synagogues in both cities.</p>

<p>"The synagogue in Derbent is on fire," the chairman of the public council of Russia's Federation of Jewish Communities, Boruch Gorin, wrote on Telegram.</p>

<p>"The synagogue in Makhachkala has also been set on fire and burnt down," he said.</p>

<p>The rabbi of Makhachkala, Rami Davidov, later told RIA Novosti that no one was killed or injured there.</p>

<p>The Russian Jewish Congress said on its website the Derbent synagogue was attacked about 40 minutes before evening prayers.</p>

<p>Gunmen fired at police and security guards and threw in Molotov cocktails, it said, adding that the attack in Makhachkala was similar.</p>

<p>The leader of Dagestan, Sergei Melikov, wrote on Telegram: "This evening in Derbent and Makhachkala unknown (attackers) made attempts to destabilise the situation in society."</p>

<p>State news agency TASS cited a law enforcement source as saying the "gunmen who carried out attacks in Makhachkala and Derbent are supporters of an international terrorist organisation", without naming it.</p>

<p>Russia's FSB security service in April said it had arrested four people in Dagestan on suspicion of plotting the deadly attack on Moscow's Crocus City Hall concert venue in March, which was claimed by the Islamic State group.</p>

<p>Militants from Dagestan are known to have travelled to join IS in Syria, and in 2015, the group declared it had established a "franchise" in the North Caucasus.</p>

<p>Dagestan lies east of Chechnya, where Russian authorities battled separatists in two brutal wars, first in 1994-1996 and then in 1999-2000.</p>

<p>Since the defeat of Chechen insurgents, Russian authorities have been locked in a simmering conflict with Islamist militants from across the North Caucasus that has killed scores of civilians and police.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thousands of people turned out in France on Sunday for feminist demonstrations against the far right, which is expected to come out on top in June 30 snap elections, as parties sought to shore up support with days to go.</p>

<p>With the far-right National Rally (RN) polling at around 35 percent, "we have to remind people that they're the ones who talked about 'comfort abortions', who are always attacking family planning services," said Morgane Legras, a nuclear engineer and feminist activist taking part in the thousands-strong march in Paris.</p>

<p>Protesters wearing violet marched from the Place de la Republique square in central Paris to Place de la Nation in the east, bearing signs with messages such as "Push back the far right, not our rights".</p>

<p>Other rallies took place in around 50 other cities such as Toulouse.</p>

<p>France's two-round election system makes it difficult to predict which party could ultimately claim a majority in the lower house of parliament, handing them the prime minister's post which is second in power to President Emmanuel Macron.</p>

<p>Since Macron dissolved parliament after a European Parliament election battering, his centrists are badly lagging the RN as well as a reforged left-wing alliance called the New Popular Front (NFP) in surveys of voting intentions.</p>

<p>The RN has garnered unprecedented levels of support after a decades-long "de-demonisation" push to distance its image from its roots, including a co-founder who was a member of the Nazi Waffen-SS paramilitary.</p>

<p>But the core of its message remains hostility to immigration, Islam and the European Union.</p>

<p>Senior RN lawmaker Sebastien Chenu gestured towards Muslim and Jewish voters Sunday by vowing not to ban the ritual slaughter of livestock to produce halal or kosher meat.</p>

<p>"Everyone will be able to keep eating kosher meat if they want," Chenu told Jewish broadcaster Radio J.</p>

<p>He added that a historic far-right policy of barring the kippa in public spaces -- in the footsteps of an existing law forbidding the full-body burka worn by some Muslim women -- was not top of the RN's agenda, saying its priority was to fight "the Islamist threat".</p>

<p><strong>'Do better'</strong></p>

<p>In Macron's camp, Prime Minister Gabriel Attal acknowledged that the European Parliament result -- where they scored just 14 percent -- was "a message to us that we have to do better with our methods, with our governance" of the country.</p>

<p>If his party defies the odds to come top in the legislative polls, he vowed "change", including a turn to "seeking out coalitions with the French public, with civil society" in an interview with broadcaster RTL.</p>

<p>Macron's alliance would open up to "all who want to come, from the conservative right to the social-democratic left", Macron's former prime minister Edouard Philippe told broadcaster France 3.</p>

<p>Attal also hammered the centrists' mantra about the threats from "extremes" on the left and right, saying both promised a "tax bludgeoning... a shredder for the middle classes".</p>

<p>The RN especially is "not ready to govern... it's a party of opposition, not a party of government", Attal said.</p>

<p>In a sign of the disquiet abroad over Macron's snap poll gamble, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz told public broadcaster ARD on Sunday that he was "concerned about the elections in France", though "it's up to the French people to decide".</p>

<p><strong>'Shut up'</strong></p>

<p>The left-wing NFP alliance continued to show strains Sunday, after parties hastily re-knitted ties sundered over differing responses to Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel and the ongoing retaliation by Israeli forces in Gaza.</p>

<p>Divisions are particularly stark over whether their candidate for prime minister should be Jean-Luc Melenchon, head of France Unbowed (LFI) -- the largest party in the grouping, some of whose members have been accused of anti-Semitism.</p>

<p>Melenchon should "shut up", former Socialist president Francois Hollande said Sunday, as "people reject him more strongly" than the RN's leaders Marine Le Pen and Jordan Bardella.</p>

<p>"Do we want the left to win, or do we want to be stoking conflict?" he said.</p>

<p>Melenchon said on Saturday that he aimed "to govern the country".</p>

<p>"I will never give up the honour of being a target" for attacks, Melenchon told a rally in the southern city of Montpellier on Sunday.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Three wolves in a zoo outside Paris attacked a 37-year-old woman leaving her fighting for her life, a source familiar with the case and local prosecutors said.</p>

<p>The woman was bitten "on the neck, the calf and the back" at the Thoiry zoo around 40 kilometres (25 miles) west of the French capital, the source familiar with the case told AFP.</p>

<p>Maryvonne Caillibotte, chief prosecutor in Versailles, said the woman's life was in danger.</p>

<p>The woman is believed to have gone out alone for a jog after spending the night with her family in a safari-style lodge at the zoo, which it advertised on its website at between 220 and 760 euros ($235-810) per night.</p>

<p>Lodges in the wolf zone promise "silence, rest and disconnection", according to the zoo's adverts. They offer "a one-of-a-kind, very intimate experience with the arctic wolves you'll be able to see from the living room".</p>

<p>The woman "ended up in the safari zone, which is supposed to be restricted to cars. That's where she was attacked by three wolves," Caillibotte said.</p>

<p>She added that it was not clear "whether she made a mistake or the trail wasn't clearly marked".</p>

<p>First responders got to the scene "very quickly", the wolves were "moved away, then returned to their area," Caillibotte siad.</p>

<p>The source familiar with the case earlier said the woman must have got through "security systems, a trench and an electric fence supposed to keep the animals in".</p>

<p>Police are investigating the incident.</p>

<p>Thoiry zoo was founded in 1968 by Paul de la Panouse, owner of a local chateau that has been in his family since the 16th Century.</p>

<p>He recalled to regional newspaper L'Independant in April how he initially stocked the zoo with a ship loaded with 120 animals brought from Kenya.</p>

<p>De la Panouse sold the zoo to a group of investors in 2018.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli troops tied a wounded Palestinian to a military vehicle during a raid in the occupied West Bank city of Jenin, the army said Sunday, admitting that soldiers had violated operational procedures.</p>

<p>Footage of the incident, which occurred on Saturday, has gone viral and shows a man strapped horizontally to the bonnet of a military jeep as it passes through a narrow alley.</p>

<p>Medics identified the Palestinian as Mujahid Raed Abbadi, 24, who told AFP he lives in the Jenin refugee camp.</p>

<p>The military said a Palestinian man was wounded during a "counterterrorism operation" to arrest wanted suspects in the area of Wadi Burqin, between the town of Burqin and Jenin.</p>

<p>During an exchange of fire between troops and militants in Burqin's Jabriyat neighbourhood, a Palestinian was wounded and apprehended, the military said in a statement.</p>

<p>The statement referred to him as a "suspect", but did not specify any accusations against Abbadi, who medics told AFP was being treated at Jenin's Ibn Sina hospital, and not in Israeli custody.</p>

<p>The military said: "In violation of orders and standard operating procedures, the suspect was taken by the forces while tied on top of a vehicle."</p>

<p>He was later transferred to the Palestinian Red Crescent for treatment, it said.</p>

<p>"The conduct of the forces in the video of the incident does not conform to the values of the IDF (military)," the statement said.</p>

<p>"The incident will be investigated and dealt with accordingly."</p>

<p>Francesca Albanese, the United Nations special rapporteur on the rights situation in the Palestinian territories, suggested the troops were using Abbadi to shield themselves from gunfire.</p>

<p>"#HumanShielding in action", Albanese wrote on social media platform X, sharing footage of the incident.</p>

<p>At the hospital, Abbadi said he was hit and wounded as he stepped out of his uncle's house in Jabriyat.</p>

<p>"I tried to withdraw and get inside the house, but they started shooting", hitting him in the hand, Abbadi told AFP in his hospital bed.</p>

<p><strong>'Stomped my head'</strong></p>

<p>He said he fell to the ground in an area behind the military jeep and was hit once more, with a bullet penetrating his leg.</p>

<p>According to Abbadi, rescuers or medics were unable to reach him for more than two hours as he lay on the ground.</p>

<p>"I started crawling" trying to escape as fighting continued around him, he said, before the Israeli troops noticed him.</p>

<p>"When they (the soldiers) arrived they stomped on my head and hit my face, my injured leg and hand," Abbadi recalled.</p>

<p>"They were laughing and playing while they hit me."</p>

<p>The soldiers lifted him and threw him on the ground before tying him to the bonnet of the jeep, he said.</p>

<p>Bahaa Abu Hammad, the doctor treating Abbadi at Ibn Sina hospital, told AFP that "he has burns on his back from neck to lower back" from being tied to the military jeep in the scorching summer heat.</p>

<p>Jenin has long been a stronghold for Palestinian militant groups, and the Israeli army routinely carries out raids in the city and an adjacent refugee camp.</p>

<p>Violence in the West Bank, which had already surged before the Israel-Hamas war broke out on October 7, has only escalated since.</p>

<p>At least 553 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank by Israeli troops or settlers since the Gaza war broke out, according to Palestinian officials.</p>

<p>Attacks by Palestinians have killed at least 14 Israelis in the West Bank over the same period, according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures.</p>

<p>The Gaza Strip has been gripped by more than eight months of war since Hamas's unprecedented October 7 attack on Israel, which resulted in the deaths of 1,194 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures.</p>

<p>Militants took 251 hostages, 116 of whom remain in Gaza, including 41 the army says are dead.</p>

<p>Israel's military offensive on Gaza has since killed at least 37,598 people, also mostly civilians, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

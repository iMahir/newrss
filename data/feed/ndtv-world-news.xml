       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Neurodevelopmental and psychiatric diseases (NPD), such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, autism, and depression, have a negative impact on individuals, families, and society. Unfortunately, effective therapies are often lacking.</p>

<p>It's becoming increasingly obvious that genetic mutations in specific genes can raise the likelihood of getting NPD, and hundreds of those "risk genes" have been found to date, but their involvement in NPD remains unknown.</p>

<p>"Very little is known about the basic function of most of these genes, and what we do know often comes from work in cancer cell lines rather than brain cell types," said David Panchision, Chief of the Developmental and Genomic Neuroscience Research Branch at the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), who spearheaded the SSPsyGene programme aiming to tackle this challenge.</p>

<p>"As such, we still don't have a clear understanding of how alterations in these genes may work individually or in combination to contribute to neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders."</p>

<p>To get to the bottom of this, the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) initiated a consortium called SSPsyGene (sspsygene.ucsc.edu) in 2023, uniting research teams from renowned US universities with the joint goal of characterising the genetic origins of NPD, focusing on 250 selected high-risk genes.</p>

<p>Among the contributors are Jubao Duan, Endeavor Health (formerly NorthShore University Health System) and University of Chicago, USA and Zhiping Pang, Rutgers University, USA with their teams, who developed a method for mutating NPD risk genes in human stem cells at large scale.</p>

<p>In the modified cells, a selected NPD risk gene is mutated so that it no longer makes a functional protein. The modified stem cells can subsequently be turned into neurons and other brain cells to model the consequences of risk gene mutations in a simplified, lab-based version of the human brain.</p>

<p>In the initial phase of the project, the teams tested 23 NPD risk genes, reported in work published in a recent article in the journal Stem Cell Reports. The resulting stem cell lines will be made available to other researchers worldwide to facilitate research on those risk genes and their contribution to NPD.</p>

<p>In future works, Pang, Duan and the other members of the consortium will join forces to generate mutated stem cell lines for a much larger number of risk genes, with the ultimate goal of understanding the genetic causes of NPD and generating better treatments.</p>

<p>"The hope is that this collaborative work will generate a highly impactful resource for the neuroscience and psychiatric research community," said Panchision.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NASA astronauts Sunita 'Suni' Williams and Barry 'Butch' Wilmore will put a call to Earth and participate in a press conference aboard the International Space Station in low Earth orbit, the US space agency said.</p>

<p>The space call is scheduled at 2:15 p.m. EDT (local time) on September 13 to the newsroom at NASA's Johnson Space Centre in Houston.</p>

<p>The pair had launched aboard <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/explained-why-helium-leaks-delayed-boeing-starliner-astronauts-return-6509846">Boeing's Starliner</a> spacecraft on June 5 for its first crewed flight, arriving at the space station on June 6.</p>

<p>A decision was made to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/boeings-starliner-spaceship-returns-to-earth-without-astronauts-6509833">return Starliner to Earth without its crew</a> and the spacecraft successfully returned on September 6 after more than three months in space. It made a safe landing at White Sands Space Harbor in New Mexico.</p>

<p>Both astronauts Sunita <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/nasa-says-there-was-tension-with-boeing-over-astronauts-space-rescue-6493860">Williams and Butch Wilmore</a> called down to flight controllers to thank teams for their support before the uncrewed Starliner spacecraft returned to Earth.</p>

<p>"You guys it's time to bring Calypso home. We have your backs and you have got this. Bring her back to Earth," Sunita Williams said in the radio message referring to the spacecrafts nickname.</p>

<p>Both the astronauts will remain on the international space station as part of the Expedition 71/72 crew and return home in February 2025 aboard the SpaceX Dragon spacecraft with two other crew members on NASA's SpaceX Crew-9 mission.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, crew of the Polaris Dawn the Elon Musk-led private charted spaceflight created history when they completed the first commercial spacewalk.</p>

<p>Donning newly-designed SpaceX extravehicular activity (EVA) suits, the crew began their approximately two-hour operation at 3:12 a.m. EDT while traveling at 17,500 miles per hour in an elliptical orbit of 190 x 700 km above the EarthThe spacewalk represents an important milestone of the Polaris Program, a developmental program designed to further the advancement of human spaceflight.</p>

<p>After opening the hatch, the Polaris Dawn crew became the first four astronauts to be exposed to the vacuum of space at the same time, the company said in a statement.</p>

<p>Over approximately twenty minutes, Commander Jared Isaacman and Mission Specialist Sarah Gillis egressed the vehicle, completed a series of tests designed to evaluate the suit's mobility, thermal systems and the Dragon mobility aid "Skywalker" before returning to the cabin and closing the hatch.</p>

<p>Mission Pilot Scott "Kidd" Poteet and Mission Specialist and Medical Officer Anna Menon supported Isaacman and Gillis throughout the entire operation monitoring vital support systems.</p>

<p>Once the hatch was closed, Dragon was re-pressurized, cabin oxygen and pressure levels confirmed.</p>

<p>Reflecting on his experience, mission commander and billionaire Isaacman, who financed the mission reflected on the experience: "SpaceX, back at home we all have a lot of work to do, but from here, Earth sure looks like a perfect world."</p>

<p>NASA Administrator Bill Nelson relayed good wishes to SpaceX and the Polaris Dawn crew in a statement on X. "Congratulations @PolarisProgram and @SpaceX on the first commercial spacewalk in history!" Nelson wrote.</p>

<p>"Today's success represents a giant leap forward for the commercial space industry and @NASA's long-term goal to build a vibrant U.S. space economy."</p>

<p>The Polaris Dawn mission targeted splashdown off the coast of Florida, however SpaceX has not yet released details about the upcoming landing.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A preview version of the model will be available through OpenAI's popular chatbot, ChatGPT, to paid Plus and Team users on Thursday.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>OpenAI is releasing a new artificial intelligence model known internally as "Strawberry" that can perform some human-like reasoning tasks, as it looks to stay at the top of a crowded market of rivals.<br />
The new model, called o1, is designed to spend more time computing the answer before responding to user queries, the company said in a blog post Thursday. With the model, OpenAI's tools should be able to solve multi-step problems, including complicated math and coding questions.</p>

<p>"As an early model, it doesn't yet have many of the features that make ChatGPT useful, like browsing the web for information and uploading files and images," the company said. "But for complex reasoning tasks this is a significant advancement and represents a new level of AI capability. Given this, we are resetting the counter back to 1 and naming this series OpenAI o1."</p>

<p>A preview version of the model will be available through OpenAI's popular chatbot, ChatGPT, to paid Plus and Team users on Thursday. Bloomberg previously reported the company could release the new model as soon as this week.</p>

<p>The model's release comes as San Francisco-based OpenAI is looking to raise billions in funding and faces heightened competition in the race to develop ever more sophisticated artificial intelligence systems. OpenAI isn't the only company working on such capabilities; competitors Anthropic and Google have also touted "reasoning" skills with their advanced AI models.</p>

<p>In its blog post, OpenAI gave examples of the AI model's responses to questions on topics including coding, English, and math, and asked it to solve a simple crossword puzzle. In a series of posts on X, Noam Brown, a research scientist at OpenAI, said the company is releasing the model in preview now in part to get a sense for how people use it, and where it needs to be improved.</p>

<p>The experience of using OpenAI's updated AI system will differ somewhat from what people have come to expect with ChatGPT, the company's chatbot. Before responding to a user's prompt, the new software will pause for a matter of seconds while, behind the scenes and invisible to the user, it considers a number of related prompts and then summarizes what appears to be the best response. This technique is sometimes referred to as "chain of thought" prompting.</p>

<p>OpenAI has been working to get computers to carry out multi-step actions for some time. In May 2023, for instance, the company released a blog post and an accompanying research paper about its efforts to improve AI systems' abilities to solve math problems. According to the paper, the company trained a model by rewarding it for each correct step in the process toward coming up with an answer to a problem, rather than by just rewarding it for generating an accurate answer.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Scott Stein had always admired the Japanese flag that hung in his grandfather's den on Long Island, New York. Passed down after Bernard Stein's death, the flag was a remnant of World War II, brought home as a war trophy by his grandfather, who served in the US Army's 38th Infantry Division. It wasn't until years later that Scott realised its significance, and made the decision to return it to its rightful place.</p>

<p dir="ltr">“I knew it was important to him, but he never spoke of his experiences,” Stein, 55, told the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2024/09/12/japanese-good-luck-flag-wwii/ ">Washington Post</a>, reflecting on the silence that often surrounded his grandfather's combat stories. “We never knew where he got the flag, but we knew it had to have come from some heavy fighting.”</p>

<p dir="ltr">The flag, known as a Yosegaki Hinomaru, or “good luck flag,” bore the name of its original owner, Japanese soldier Yukikazu Hiyama, along with messages of well-wishes from his family and friends. Each Japanese soldier carried such a flag into battle, tucked under their uniforms, as a personal memento.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">After inheriting the flag, Scott Stein displayed it in his own home for years until he began to feel it wasn't appropriate as decor. “I started to realise a while back that maybe it wasn't the best home decor,” he said. Determined to return it to its origins, he learned about the OBON Society, a non-profit dedicated to reuniting families with these personal artefacts of war.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Scott Stein mailed the flag to the OBON Society, which, after years of research, tracked down Hiyama's only surviving child, Tsukasa Hiyama, an 81-year-old man living on the Japanese island of Honshu. Tsukasa never knew his father, who was killed in action in 1945, two years after leaving to serve in the Imperial Army.</p>

<p dir="ltr">For Tsukasa, the return of the flag was a profound moment. “When I held the flag in my hands, it felt as if I could sense my father's warmth for the first time,” he said. He took the flag to his mother's tombstone and unfurled it, bringing a sense of closure to a family that had long wondered about the fate of their loved one.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The OBON Society, founded by Keiko and Rex Ziak, has returned more than 600 such flags to families of fallen soldiers. Keiko Ziak noted that these flags were often the last tangible connection families had to their loved ones, calling them “like a love letter to each soldier.”</p>

<p dir="ltr">For Scott Stein, the act of returning the flag felt like fulfilling a larger purpose. “It feels like good karma to give it back,” he said. “I hope it raises awareness that these flags are still out there, hanging on other walls.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former US President Donald Trump marked the anniversary of the September 11 terrorist attacks with commemorative stops in New York City and Pennsylvania on Wednesday. However, his tributes were overshadowed by the presence of far-right figure Laura Loomer, who has a history of promoting conspiracy theories about the 2001 attacks and posting anti-Muslim content on social media.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Loomer, who was banned from Twitter (now X) for her inflammatory posts before being reinstated by Elon Musk, has previously suggested that the 9/11 attacks were an “inside job.”</p>

<p>When asked why Loomer was part of Trump's entourage, a campaign official sidestepped the question, and told <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/12/politics/laura-loomer-donald-trump-influence/index.html ">CNN</a> that the day was about “the souls no longer with us, their families, and the heroes who courageously stepped up to save their fellow Americans on that fateful day.”</p>

<p>In a phone interview, Loomer defended her presence at the memorial. “I don't understand the issue with me going to a 9/11 memorial,” she told CNN. “People who greeted President Trump were happy to see me and thanked me for coming.” She added that she has never denied the role of Islamic terrorists in the attacks, doubling down on her history of vocalising concerns about “Islamic terrorism in America.”</p>

<p>Laura Loomer's presence around Donald Trump has grown increasingly prominent, with reports indicating she has access to his personal phone number and regularly attends his events.</p>

<p>The controversial figure was also spotted deboarding Trump's private plane in Philadelphia before his debate against Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris. Later that night, Trump referenced a baseless rumour about Haitian migrants, which Loomer had also promoted online.</p>

<p>Some of her other provocative social media posts have even preceded Trump's own public statements, suggesting a possible influence on his rhetoric.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This association is consistent with Trump's history of embracing conspiracy theorists, dating back to his promotion of the “birther” conspiracy about former President Barack Obama's birthplace.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Loomer's potential sway over Trump was also recently seen when Trump questioned Kamala Harris' heritage during an interview, with some sources attributing the talking points to Loomer.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In defence, Loomer told CNN, “I don't think it's racist to mock the fact that Kamala Harris panders to every single group of people who she encounters in an effort to try to convince them that she shares their same identity,” but she did not confirm if she influenced Trump's remarks.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prince Harry was once one of the British royal family's most popular members, but as he celebrates his 40th birthday this weekend he is increasingly distanced from the UK public and his own family.</p>

<p>The younger son of King Charles III, now living in California with his American television actress wife Meghan and their two young children, reaches the landmark on Sunday.</p>

<p>The Duke and Duchess of Sussex, Prince Archie, aged five, and three-year-old Princess Lilibet live in the celebrity enclave of Montecito, near Santa Barbara, on the US West Coast.</p>

<p>But Harry is not only separated by geography.</p>

<p>"He is completely isolated. I don't see him coming back even with a minor role... there's no sign of an official role for him," Pauline Maclaran, from Royal Holloway University of London, told AFP.</p>

<p>"They (the public) don't trust him," added royal commentator Richard Fitzwilliams.</p>

<h3><strong>Fraught ties with royals&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Harry's ties with the royal family have been increasingly fraught since the couple quit royal life and moved to North America in early 2020.</p>

<p>First came an explosive television interview with Oprah Winfrey, in which the couple claimed that senior royals speculated about the colour of their unborn son's skin.</p>

<p>Meghan is of mixed heritage.</p>

<p>Suggestions of racism prompted Harry's brother William, heir to the throne, to declare when asked that the royals were "very much not a racist family".</p>

<p>The brothers' grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II, also politely questioned Harry and Meghan's version of events.</p>

<p>"Recollections may vary," she said in a statement, promising to look into the matter.</p>

<p>A potentially decisive rupture came early last year with the publication of Harry's uncompromising and unfiltered autobiography "Spare".</p>

<p>The book, which is set to be released in paperback in October, was seen as an all-out attack against the centuries-old institution of the royal family, which still plays a central role in British life.</p>

<p>It includes lengthy passages on Harry's strained relationship with his "beloved brother" William, 42, whom he also describes as his "arch-nemesis", and their father.</p>

<p>Experts told AFP they did not see any reconciliation on the horizon.</p>

<p>"His differences from other members of the royal family probably would have been settled by now if any agreement had ever been possible," said Mark Garnett, from the University of Lancaster in northwest England.</p>

<p>"The idea of a divided royal family only increases unwelcome media attention."</p>

<p>Harry told American TV network ABC in February that he was "sure" his father's cancer diagnosis could reunite the family, days after a brief visit to the king.</p>

<p>However, on another visit by the prince to London in May, father and son were at separate events nearby but did not meet.</p>

<p>Harry, who has railed against media intrusion, even reportedly declined an invitation to stay at Buckingham Palace during his visit and instead stayed at a London hotel.</p>

<p>"He is naive about the damage he has caused", said Maclaran.</p>

<h3><strong>'Locked horns'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Relations between William and Harry, whose once-close bond was forged with the death of their mother Princess Diana in 1997, remain publicly frosty.</p>

<p>They were seen together at the late queen's funeral in September 2022 but have pointedly kept their distance at subsequent events, including at their father's coronation in May last year.</p>

<p>Royal author Robert Jobson likened the pair, who are reportedly not on speaking terms, to stags "who have locked horns".&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I can't really see a reconciliation in the near future," he told reporters in London this week.</p>

<p>While Harry and Meghan have more supporters in the United States, the British public has also apparently taken sides in the family feud.</p>

<p>Harry and Meghan languish at the bottom of royal popularity surveys, alongside his disgraced uncle Prince Andrew, whose links to the late US sex offender Jeffrey Epstein have made him persona non grata.</p>

<p>In contrast, William and his wife Catherine, who is recovering from cancer, are hugely popular.</p>

<p>Former British Army captain Harry, meanwhile, is keeping busy with several projects, chief among them the preparation and promotion of the Invictus Games he founded for military veterans with disabilities.</p>

<p>He and Meghan also recently completed a mini-tour in Colombia and Nigeria promoting mental health, equality and inclusion.</p>

<p>If royal tours are a "vehicle for (British) diplomacy", the Sussexes' visits are a way of refining their "branding", said Maclaran, who has written about the royals and consumer culture.</p>

<p>The tours are a way to "stay relevant", she added. It is only "the (royal) titles that make them different from other celebrities", she added.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>More than a year of war between rival generals has killed tens of thousands of people, forced millions more to flee their homes, and left the country's prized antiquities at the mercy of pillagers.</p>

<p>On Thursday, UNESCO, the United Nations's cultural body, said the "threat to culture appears to have reached an unprecedented level, with reports of looting of museums, heritage and archaeological sites and private collections".</p>

<p>In the capital Khartoum, where fighting broke out in April 2023 between the army and paramilitary forces, the recently renovated Sudan National Museum has had prized artefacts stolen, archaeologists and officials say.</p>

<p>The museum houses prehistoric artefacts from the Palaeolithic era and items from the famed site of Kerma in northern Sudan, as well as Pharaonic and Nubian pieces.</p>

<p>First opened in 1971, the museum was founded in part to house objects rescued from an area due to be flooded by the construction of Egypt's massive Aswan dam.</p>

<p>Now, its artefacts are under threat from war.</p>

<p>"The Sudan National Museum has been the subject of major looting," said Ikhlas Abdel Latif, head of museums at the national antiquities authority.</p>

<p>"Archaeological objects stored there have been taken in big lorries and transferred to the west and to border areas, particularly near South Sudan," she told AFP.</p>

<h3><strong>'Refrain' from trade&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>The extent of the looting is hard to determine because the museum is located in an area controlled by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF).</p>

<p>Officials and experts have accused the RSF of looting the site. Contacted by AFP, a spokesman for the force did not comment.</p>

<p>In May, the RSF said it was being "vigilant" in "protecting and preserving the antiquities of the Sudanese people".</p>

<p>Throughout history, fighters have used plunder to fund their war efforts.</p>

<p>UNESCO said it was calling on "the public and the art market... in the region and worldwide to refrain" from trading in Sudanese items.</p>

<p>The agency also said it was planning training in the Egyptian capital Cairo for law enforcement and the judiciary from Sudan's neighbours.</p>

<p>"Because of the war, the museum and the artefacts are not being monitored," said Hassan Hussein, a researcher and former director of the National Antiquities Authority.</p>

<p>The army, led by Sudan's de facto ruler Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, is locked in conflict with the RSF, which is led by his former deputy, Mohamed Hamdan Daglo.</p>

<h3><strong>For sale&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>The Island of Meroe, a UNESCO World Heritage site that is home to the capital of the ancient Kingdom of Kush and dozens of its pyramids, is also under threat.</p>

<p>Artefacts and exhibition accessories have been stolen from the museum in Nyala, the South Darfur state capital, said Abdel Latif.</p>

<p>In Omdurman, just across the River Nile from Khartoum, part of the Khalifa House museum was also destroyed, she said.</p>

<p>Last week, the Association of Friends of Sudanese Museums condemned "in the strongest terms" the looting that is taking place across the country.</p>

<p>Experts voiced alarm after finding looted artefacts offered for sale online.</p>

<p>On the auction site eBay, a user offered items presented as Egyptian antiquities that, according to Sudanese media, were looted from Sudan.</p>

<p>AFP saw the listings, with items offered for a few hundred dollars, but was not able to independently verify the authenticity or origin of the items.</p>

<p>A Sudanese archaeologist, speaking anonymously for security reasons, told AFP that pottery, gold objects and paintings listed for sale appeared to have come from the National Museum in Khartoum -- although at least one statuette was an imitation.</p>

<p>He said he feared for the larger statues, which "must be handled by specialists in a precise manner" and could be damaged if looters were to lay hands on them.</p>

<p>The issue is set to be discussed at an upcoming conference in Germany, which Hussein will attend.</p>

<p>"The current state of the collections is a concern for anyone who cares about humanity's heritage," he said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Colombia's President Gustavo Petro is facing criticism from press freedom groups after some comments made about female reporters, calling them "dolls of the mafia" in one of the most dangerous countries for journalists in South America.</p>

<p>Without a hint of irony, Petro made the statement at the August 30 inauguration of Colombia's new human rights ombud Iris Marin -- the first woman to hold the job.</p>

<p>Petro, the South American country's first-ever leftist president, has often bristled at criticism from the media, which he has accused of conspiring with armed groups, business tycoons or other powerful figures.</p>

<p>Some say he has now gone too far in a country where dozens of threats and attacks of various types are reported against women reporters every year.</p>

<p>In his address, Petro had railed against "the (women) journalists of power, the 'dolls of the mafia,'" who he said had pilloried 2019-2021 protests against the rightwing government that preceded him.</p>

<p>Petro, who was a lawmaker at the time, had supported those demonstrations.</p>

<p>It is not clear why he targeted women reporters specifically.</p>

<p>Criticism was swift, and Petro tried to explain that he had been speaking of "female journalists from the establishment... hired by dark powers" in a statement that did little to quell the outrage.</p>

<p>Marin later said "there is no room for stigmatization" of female journalists in Colombia.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Nothing justifies it."</p>

<h3><strong>'Reinforces gender stereotypes'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Reporters Without Borders (RSF) describes Colombia as "one of the most dangerous countries on the continent for journalists," with two murdered so far this year.</p>

<p>The FLIP Press Freedom Foundation says Petro's statements were being used as a basis for online content "that is violent or reinforces gender stereotypes."</p>

<p>The foundation has reported 171 cases of threats and attacks -- the exact nature of which it did not specify -- against female reporters since last year.</p>

<p>Petro has on occasion singled out journalists with accusations that have included them allying with rightwing paramilitary groups to "unleash a genocide."</p>

<p>"We observe with concern a strained climate for journalistic work in Colombia, exacerbated... by Petro's excessive expressions," said Carlos Jornet of the Inter-American Press Association (IAPA).</p>

<p>Petro is not the only Latin American leader to have an antagonistic relationship with the press.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Other notable examples include Mexico's Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, and past presidents such as Rafael Correa of Ecuador and Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil.</p>

<p>The "dolls" comment was, however, the Colombian leader's first attack on journalists based on their gender.</p>

<p>"Stigmatization kills, shortens lives, shortens dreams, shortens careers..." Colombian journalist and newscaster Claudia Palacios said in a video sent to AFP about Petro's comments.</p>

<p>Several other news figures have condemned the statements which sparked a furious online debate in the country.</p>

<p>Approached by AFP, the presidency insisted it "recognizes the key role women journalists play in strengthening democracy and building public debate."</p>

<p>On Monday, Petro signed a decree -- a first for the Americas -- that would prevent public servants &nbsp;-- including himself -- from "stigmatizing" journalists.</p>

<p>But what could have been a reconciliatory moment was upended when the president used the launch to once again take aim at none other than the media.</p>

<p>In his address, Petro accused journalists of vilifying him for defending himself against media "slander."</p>

<p>"A missed opportunity," reacted FLIP director Jonathan Bock after the event.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, a petition was filed with Colombia's Council of State -- the highest court for administrative matters -- for an order directing Petro to apologize for his "dolls of the mafia" statement.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Illia 'Golem' Yefimchyk, widely recognised as the world's "most monstrous bodybuilder," died aged 36, reportedly due to a heart attack. He was admitted to a hospital on September 6, where he fell into a coma, and passed away on September 11.&nbsp;The Belarusian man&nbsp;earned the nickname "The Mutant" in bodybuilding circles due to his imposing 6-foot frame and 340-pound weight.</p>

<p>Yefimchyk's wife, Anna, performed chest compressions while waiting for an ambulance to arrive, The <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/09/12/sports/bodybuilder-illia-golem-yefimchyk-dead-at-36/" rel="No follow, No Index">New York </a>Post reported.</p>

<p>"I spent every day with him, hoping for recovery. His heart started beating again for two days, but doctors informed me that his brain had stopped functioning," Anna shared with local media.</p>

<p>He maintained 25-inch biceps through a rigorous diet, consuming up to 16,500 calories a day, which reportedly included over five pounds of steak and more than 100 pieces of sushi across seven meals.</p>

<p>Although Yefimchyk never competed in professional bodybuilding events, he shared his training routines online, amassing many followers across social media platforms.</p>

<p>He claimed impressive lifting stats, including a 600-pound bench press, 700-pound deadlift, and 700-pound squats.</p>

<p>His death follows those of British bodybuilder Neil Currey, 34, and Brazilian competitor Antonio Souza, 26. Currey was found dead in September 2023, with his parents attributing it to prolonged steroid use, according to the BBC. Souza died from cardiac arrest on August 3 after placing in the top three at a competition.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The fierce presidential debate between US Vice President Kamala Harris, and former President Donald Trump took social media by storm, generating responses of all kinds ranging from netizens to Taylor Swift and Elon Musk.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The fierce US presidential debate between Vice President Kamala Harris, and former President Donald Trump took social media by storm, generating responses of all kinds ranging from netizens to Taylor Swift and Elon Musk. The debate attracted 67.1 million television viewers, according to Nielsen data.</p>

<p>What followed, is a conspiracy theory, mostly by Trump supporters, who claimed that Kamala Harris had clip-on audio headphones on her throughout the debate, under the guise of her pearl earrings. There were speculations that her earrings were actually Icebach Sound Solutions' Nova H1 Audio Earrings, a Bluetooth device designed to look like jewellery.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a statement fuelling the speculation, Icebach's managing director, Malte Iversen, reportedly said to tech outlet Tom's Guide, "We do not know whether Mrs Harris wore one of our products. The resemblance is striking." He also humorously offered to create a male version of the device for Trump, suggesting that the colour orange posed a design challenge.&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<br />

<br />

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Despite the viral claims, experts and fact-checkers have pointed out that Harris's actual earrings are the Double Pearl Hinged Earrings from Tiffany &amp; Co. which retail for approximately $800. These earrings bear little resemblance to Icebach's Bluetooth devices, which are priced at around $625.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Harris has previously criticized the use of Bluetooth earpieces as a security risk and has been seen using wired earbuds during her campaign. The ongoing speculation surrounding her jewellery highlights the heightened scrutiny and mistrust that often accompany political debates.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Similar conspiracy theories were spotted on social media during the 2020 and 2016 election cycles which claimed that Joe Biden and Hillary Clinton were using earpieces during their debates against Trump.</p>

<p>As reported by the New York Post, Icebach Sound Solutions has also announced plans to address the rumours during an upcoming appearance on "The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon." The company stated on its website that it has received numerous interview requests since the debate and chose Fallon as a "trusted Bavarian in heart" for a live interview.</p>

<p>However, it looks like Donald Trump might not need this offer of similar earpieces as he has already refused to have another debate with Kamala Harris. "THERE WILL BE NO THIRD DEBATE!" the former president wrote on the social media site Truth Social.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Israeli army said on Thursday that the head of an elite intelligence unit will resign over the failure to prevent Hamas's October 7 attack.</p>

<p>"The commander of the 8200 unit, (Brigadier General) Yossi Sariel, has informed his commanders and subordinates of his intention to end his position," the army said in a statement.</p>

<p>"The officer will conclude his role in the near future."</p>

<p>The prestigious and secretive Unit 8200 is in charge of decoding and analysing intercepts and other signals intelligence.</p>

<p>In the wake of October 7, Israel's Military Intelligence Directorate was thrown into a crisis that led to its commander, Major General Aharon Haliva, announcing his resignation in April 2024.</p>

<p>The army said then that Haliva had asked to be relieved of his duties for the directorate's failure to foil the October 7 attack.</p>

<p>Israeli media on Thursday broadcast a copy of Sariel's resignation letter in which he asked for "forgiveness" for "not fulfilling the mission we were entrusted with" on October 7.</p>

<p>In June, public broadcaster Kan disclosed the existence of an intelligence brief prepared by Unit 8200 in September 2023 that warned military officials of Hamas's preparations for the attack.</p>

<p>Kan said the Unit 8200 document included details of elite Hamas fighters training for hostage-taking and plans for raids on military positions and Israeli communities in southern Israel.</p>

<p>The October 7 attack resulted in the deaths of more than 1,205 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.</p>

<p>Included in that count are hostages who were killed in captivity.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory offensive against Hamas has killed at least 41,118 people in Gaza, according to the territory's health ministry. The UN rights office says most of the dead are women and children.</p>

<p>Netanyahu has repeatedly refused to open an official inquiry into October 7 until the war in Gaza is over.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Elon Musk's estranged daughter Vivian Wilson, who came out as transgender in 2022, has attacked her father over his controversial post on X offering to give Taylor Swift a child after she endorsed Democratic nominee Kamala Harris for president.</p>

<p>"The timing for the Taylor Swift endorsement of Kamala Harris honestly could not have been better. Can't wait to see the Swifties at the polls! Vote blue," the 20-year-old wrote on Instagram's Threads, in support of the pop star.</p>

<p>Wilson also addressed her father's post on X responding to Swift's endorsement where she described herself as a "childless cat lady", a term Donald Trump's running mate used to mock women without children.</p>

<p>"Fine Taylor … you win … I will give you a child and guard your cats with my life," the Tesla CEO had said in a post on X, which users in the comments described as "weird" and "creepy".</p>

<p>In a second post on Instagram Threads, she acknowledged seeing the post and labelled it <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.threads.net/@vivllainous/post/C_x7KKQS18u">"heinous incel nonsense".</a></p>

<p>“Also, yes, I saw "the tweet". Heinous incel nonsense is in fact heinous incel nonsense. I don't really have anything to add to it, it's just abhorrent. That much is obvious and if you don't see how then you're part of the problem. I would just like to say to my audience members, don't let people talk to you like that. It's disgusting, it's belittling and incredibly sexist. You deserve better,” she wrote.</p>

<p>The term incel, short for involuntary celibate, is often used to describe men who are hostile towards women who they think consider them unattractive and deny them sex.</p>

<p>“I really am not the biggest fan of this subject. I am my own person with my own name after all. However, I just feel like that had to be said even if it's incredibly self-evident. Cheers," she said.</p>

<p>Wilson is one of Musk's 12 children.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The tech billionaire's relationship strained with his daughter after she petitioned a US court to change her name and gender in June 2022, requesting to take her mother's last name.</p>

<p>Musk is known for his "anti-trans" views and claimed that Wilson, who was assigned male at birth, had been “killed by the woke-mind virus” and alleged that he was “tricked” into allowing her gender reassignment surgeries.</p>

<p>In her petition, Wilson had stated that she “no longer lives with or wishes to be related to [her] biological father in any way, shape or form.”<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Elon Musk, owner of social media platform X, on Friday called Australia's centre-left government "fascists" over proposed legislation to slap fines on social media firms for failing to prevent the spread of misinformation online.</p>

<p>Australia's Labor government on Thursday unveiled legislation in Parliament which could fine internet platforms up to 5% of their global revenue for enabling misinformation, joining a worldwide push to rein in borderless tech giants.</p>

<p>The proposed law would require tech platforms to set codes of conduct to stop dangerous falsehoods spreading and be approved by a regulator. The regulator would set its own standard if a platform failed to do so and fine firms for non-compliance.</p>

<p>Musk, who views himself as a champion of free speech, responded to a post by an X user linking the Reuters story about the misinformation law with one word: "Fascists".</p>

<p>In a previous clash with the Australian government, X in April went to court to challenge a cyber regulator's order for the removal of some posts about the stabbing of a bishop in Sydney, prompting Prime Minister Anthony Albanese to call Musk an "arrogant billionaire".</p>

<p>Musk's latest criticism of the push against misinformation drew rebukes from government lawmakers, with Assistant Treasurer Stephen Jones calling his comment "crackpot stuff".</p>

<p>"This is about sovereignty, and whether it's the Australian government or any other government around the world, we assert our right to pass laws which will keep Australians safe," Jones told ABC television.</p>

<p>Social media platforms should not publish scam content, deepfake materials and livestream violence in the name of free speech, he said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Alaska Airlines 369, with 176 passengers and six crew on board, aborted takeoff due to a potential traffic conflict after it had received clearance for takeoff from air traffic control, the airline said.</p>

<p>The Federal Aviation Administration said Southwest Airlines Flight 2029 had been cleared to cross the end of the same runway and the agency is investigating the incident. The Alaska pilots immediately applied the brakes to prevent the incident from escalating, the carrier added. The plane had been scheduled to fly to Seattle and passengers are being moved to a new plane.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Republican U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump said on Thursday that he will end all taxes on overtime pay as part of a wider tax cut package, if he is elected in the Nov. 5 election.</p>

<p>"As part of our additional tax cuts, we will end all taxes on overtime," Trump said in remarks at a rally in Tucson, Arizona. "Your overtime hours will be tax-free."</p>

<p>Trump, who faces Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris in what polls show to be a tight race, has previously said he would seek legislation to end the taxation of tips to aid service workers. Harris has made a similar pledge.</p>

<p>The subject of overtime has recently become a campaign issue between Trump and Harris.</p>

<p>At a campaign event this month with union workers, Harris accused Trump of "blocking" overtime from millions of workers during his 2017-2021 presidency.</p>

<p>In 2019, the Trump administration issued a rule increasing the eligibility of overtime pay to 1.3 million additional U.S. workers, replacing a more generous proposal that had been introduced by President Barack Obama, Trump's Democratic predecessor.</p>

<p>The Trump administration raised the salary level for exemption from overtime pay to $35,568 a year, up from the long-standing $23,660 threshold. Workers' rights groups criticized the move, saying it covered far fewer workers than the scheme introduced under Obama.</p>

<p>Under Obama, the Labor Department proposed raising the threshold to more than $47,000, which would have made nearly 5 million more workers eligible for overtime. That rule was later struck down in court.</p>

<p>Overtime pay at these income levels overwhelmingly benefits blue-collar workers, such as fast-food workers, nurses, store assistants and other low-income employees.</p>

<p>"The people who work overtime are among the hardest working citizens in our country and for too long no one in Washington has been looking out for them," Trump said on Thursday.</p>

<p>Under Labor Department rules, eligible workers must be paid at least time-and-a-half for hours worked above 40 hours in a single work-week.</p>

<p>As of last month, American factory workers in non-supervisory roles put in an average of 3.7 hours of overtime a week, data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows.</p>

<p>Not taxing overtime would result in less government revenue, at a time when Trump's plan to permanently extend the tax cuts he passed as president would expand the U.S. deficit by $3.5 trillion through 2033, according to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office. The U.S. budget deficit in the first 11 months of this fiscal year is $1.9 trillion.</p>

<p>It's unclear how much revenue the government receives from taxes on overtime pay.</p>

<p>Trump's proposal would be a first for the federal government. Alabama this year became the first state to exclude overtime wages for hourly workers from state taxes as a temporary measure that won legislative support in part to help employers fill jobs in a tight labor market. The exemption is for 18 months only.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Government buildings and an elementary school in Springfield, Ohio were evacuated Thursday after an emailed bomb threat, police said, rattling the small US city at the heart of an anti-migrant conspiracy theory amplified by Donald Trump.</p>

<p>Springfield has been thrust into the spotlight in recent days after an unfounded story of Haitian migrants eating pets went viral on social media, with the Republican ex-president and current White House candidate pushing the narrative despite it being debunked.</p>

<p>Democrats have accused Trump and his running mate, Ohio Senator JD Vance, of fanning racial tensions as they use the Springfield conspiracy theory to elevate immigration as a campaign issue ahead of November's election.</p>

<p>Trump doubled down on the rhetoric during a campaign rally in Tucson, Arizona on Thursday, saying that "migrants are walking off with the town's geese."</p>

<p>Immediately after mentioning Springfield in his speech, Trump added: "I'm angry about young American girls being raped and sodomized and murdered by savage criminal aliens," though provided no specific details.</p>

<p>Springfield authorities said there were no credible reports of pets being harmed by members of the immigrant community -- accusations that Trump also repeated in his Thursday debate against Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris.</p>

<p>The White House condemned the claims on Thursday as "filth" and said they were endangering people's lives.</p>

<p>On Thursday, Springfield police said that City Hall and several other government buildings had been evacuated after a bomb threat sent by email at 8:24 am (1224 GMT).</p>

<p>"Authorities investigated and cleared all facilities listed in the threat with the assistance of explosive detecting canines," the force said in a statement.</p>

<p>Fulton Elementary School and Springfield Academy of Excellence were also listed in the threat and evacuated, according to the statement.</p>

<p>"We are currently partnering with the Dayton office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation to identify the source of the email," it added.</p>

<p><strong>- Tensions in community -</strong></p>

<p>Arriving at the school to retrieve his child, Haitian immigrant Mackenso Roseme told AFP that the current tensions in the community were "worrying."</p>

<p>"I'm a little stressed. I think something might happen," he said.</p>

<p>A sign in English, Spanish and Haitian Creole informed Roseme and other parents that the students had been moved to a high school.</p>

<p>Mayor Rob Rue told the Springfield News-Sun that the person who sent the bomb threat claimed to be from the city and mentioned Haitian immigration issues.</p>

<p>Despite the bomb threats, Trump was still reposting memes related to the conspiracy theory hours later on his Truth Social platform.</p>

<p>He claimed Ohio was being "inundated with illegal migrants, mostly from Haiti, who are taking over Towns and Villages at a level and rate never seen before."</p>

<p>Springfield, with a population of about 58,000, has seen an increase in Haitian immigrants in recent years -- 10,000 to 15,000 according to the Springfield News-Sun.</p>

<p>Social services, schools and housing have been stressed in the city for years, with some pointing to migration as a factor.</p>

<p>Ohio Governor Mike DeWine -- a Republican like Trump -- gave some context to the situation in Springfield during an interview Thursday.</p>

<p>DeWine said 15,000 immigrants from Haiti live in Springfield, "a dramatic change" for the city, and added they were there under Temporary Protected Status (TPS), which allows foreign nationals to live and work in the United States. &nbsp;</p>

<p>"Why did they come? They came for jobs," DeWine told Fox News reporters. "There's nothing wrong with us being welcoming."</p>

<p>A multiracial group of pastors called a press conference Thursday in Springfield, joining hands in prayer and calling on the community to come together.</p>

<p>"Today there were some things that happened, some threats of violence," Wes Babian, a former pastor of First Baptist Church, told AFP.</p>

<p>"That is part of what motivated the quick calling of clergy to come together to express our support for the Haitian community and our concern for the well-being of the entire community."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has called for increasing the number of centrifuges for uranium enrichment in order to increase its nuclear weapons for self-defence, the state media said on Friday.</p>

<p>Kim made the call during a visit to the Nuclear Weapons Institute and the "production base of weapon-grade nuclear materials", according to the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA). The dispatch did not release the location of the facility or date of the visit.</p>

<p>"He went round the control room of the uranium enrichment base to learn about the overall operation of the production lines," the KCNA said, adding that Kim expressed great satisfaction after being briefed that the "base is dynamically producing nuclear materials."</p>

<p>It marks the first time North Korea has publicly revealed details of its uranium enrichment facility, Yonhap news agency reported.</p>

<p>Kim also "stressed the need to further augment the number of centrifuges in order to exponentially increase the nuclear weapons for self-defence true to the Party's line of building up nuclear-armed forces," the KCNA said.</p>

<p>A uranium enrichment facility is used to produce highly enriched uranium by placing uranium in centrifuges and spinning it at high speeds. Highly enriched uranium is essential for the manufacture of nuclear warheads.</p>

<p>South Korean and US intelligence agencies believe North Korea operates uranium enrichment facilities at the Kangson nuclear complex near Pyongyang and at the Yongbyon nuclear site.</p>

<p>In 2010, North Korea invited Siegfried Hecker, a renowned American nuclear scientist, to inspect its uranium enrichment facility at Yongbyon.</p>

<p>Additionally, Kim called for improving the separation capacity of the centrifuges and accelerating the development of a new type of centrifuge to "further solidify the foundation for producing weapons-grade nuclear materials."</p>

<p>The sudden public disclosure of the uranium enrichment facility is seen as a move to flaunt North Korea's nuclear capabilities ahead of the US presidential election in November.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, during a key deterrence dialogue between South Korea and the US, the allies warned of the possibility that North Korea could conduct significant provocations, such as a nuclear test or an intercontinental ballistic missile launch, close to the election.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Fulton County Judge Scott McAfee found that state prosecutors did not have the authority to bring those charges, which related to the alleged filing of false documents in federal court.</p>

<p>McAfee allowed the remainder of the case to move forward, including eight charges against Trump.

       <description><![CDATA[Former President Donald Trump on Thursday said he would not participate in another election debate against his rival Vice President Kamala Harris.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Republican nominee Donald Trump said on Thursday he would not participate in another presidential debate against Kamala Harris ahead of the Nov. 5 election, after several polls showed his Democratic rival won their debate earlier this week.</p>

<p>"THERE WILL BE NO THIRD DEBATE!" the former president wrote on social media site Truth Social. Trump had participated in a debate against President Joe Biden in June before his debate against Harris on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Although Trump touted his performance on Tuesday against Harris, six Republican donors and three Trump advisers who spoke to Reuters earlier this week said they thought Harris had won the debate largely because Trump was unable to stay on message.</p>

<p>The debate attracted 67.1 million television viewers, according to Nielsen data.</p>

<p>Harris, speaking at a rally shortly after Trump's post went live, said: "I believe we owe it to the voters to have another debate."</p>

<p>While Trump said in his post that polls showed he won the debate, several surveys showed that respondents thought Harris did better.</p>

<p>Among voters who said they had heard at least something about Tuesday's debate, 53% said Harris won and 24% said Trump won, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Thursday.</p>

<p>The poll showed that 54% of registered voters believed that the single debate between Trump and Harris was enough, while 46% had wanted a second debate.</p>

<p>A majority of debate watchers said Harris outperformed Trump, according to a CNN flash poll released shortly after the debate. YouGov showed 54% of those surveyed said Harris won while 31% said Trump was the victor.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

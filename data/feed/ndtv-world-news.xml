       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Millions of people in the US East Coast are reporting outage in Verizon Fios internet. According to Down Detector, the reports started coming from early Tuesday morning (local time). The heat map of the United States shows users majorly reporting issues in Boston, New York and Washington. The area covers an area of almost 300 miles or 500 kilometres from Philadelphia and Pennsylvania to Richmond and Virginia. Verizon's wireless network is one of the largest in the United States, covering 70 per cent of the country with its LTE network.</p>

<p>Several users started posting about the outage on X (formerly Twitter).</p>

<p>"Verizon has all of us night owls and insomniacs in a tizzy because there's an apparent outage, nationwide. It's definitely here in DC, MD, and I believe Virginia," commented one user. "This verizon internet outage seems unusual. Annoying also," said another.</p>

<p>"Huge internet outage for Verizon happening overnight. It's already been out over two hours," said a third user.</p>

<p>Responding to one of the users, Verizon said, "There is either an outage or network maintenance impacting your area. We don't have full details just yet. Our apologies for any inconvenience this is causing. We're trying to get all the information from our network team so we can provide you all an update."</p>

<p>Reports of the outages spiked between midnight and 2 am EST, with the network receiving thousands of complaints during this time, according to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://downdetector.com/status/verizon/map/">Down Detector</a>.</p>

<p>Ninety per cent of these complaints relate to the internet services, nine per cent were described as "total blackout" while one per cent affected TV streaming.</p>

<p>Verizon Fios is a fiber-optic internet, TV, and phone service provided by the company.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The couple, together for nine years, had announced the wedding date in January and were eagerly looking forward to their long-awaited special day.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kalina Marie was left devastated after she walked into her wedding venue, only to find most of her friends and family missing as the lavishly decorated hall wore an empty and sad look. Ms Marie had long dreamt of a fairytale wedding, surrounded by her loved ones but what she saw was every newlywed's nightmare. Documenting the incident on social media, Ms Marie, hailing from Oregon, US, posted a video where she alongside the groom, Shane, could be seen walking hand-in-hand into the reception area with long faces as only a handful of people cheered the couple.</p>

<p>The only silver lining was the couple's son who came alongside and walked them down the aisle as Miley Cyrus' "When I Look at You" played in the background as the entry song. According to Marie, she had 'digitally' invited 75 people and personally sent 25 invitations to the masquerade-themed event.</p>

<p>"The Masquerade ball that I have talked excessively about for the last 10 months. The same ball that I not only digitally invited over 75 people to. But also spent money to send 25 beautiful invitations out to," she wrote in the caption of the past, adding that only "FIVE PEOPLE SHOWED UP!!!!".</p>

<p>The couple, together for nine years, had announced the wedding date in January and were eagerly looking forward to their long-awaited special day.</p>

<p>"Like, are you kidding me!?!? As you see in the video, we enter the venue. And no one is there. The invite said 1 pm. My mum messaged me at 1:15 pm that no one was there. My husband and I finally showed up at 2 o'clock, to five people, in a venue planned for 40," she added.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/massachusetts-court-revises-engagement-rules-bride-ordered-to-return-70-000-ring-6977830" rel="noindex, nofollow"><strong>Also read | Bride vs Groom Over $70,000 Engagement Ring: US Court's Landmark Decision</strong></a></p>

<h3><strong>'Little embarrased'</strong></h3>

<p>Feeling low by the disappointing turnout, Ms Marie decided to pick herself up and headed to the dancefloor to have her first dance with Shane. The video clips showed the few people in the venue joining the couple as well to make the best of the situation.</p>

<p>"It just makes me think, like, why? What did we do? Am I that bad of a person? What did my husband ever do to deserve any of this?" she questioned. "Why couldn't we matter enough for people to show up?"</p>

<p>Ms Marie posted an update a few days after the wedding, admitting that she and her husband were "a little embarrassed and still moving through the stages of grief" as well as "still dealing with anger".</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[In a landmark ruling last month, for the first time in South Korea, a court recognised misogyny as a motive for a hate crime.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Aspiring South Korean writer On Ji-goo never considered herself a feminist but changed her mind after being physically attacked by a man for having short hair.</p>

<p>"I know you are a feminist," her attacker yelled as he beat her up at the convenience store where she worked part time.</p>

<p>Her assailant, in his 20s, also severely assaulted an older man who tried to intervene, telling him: "Why aren't you supporting a fellow man?"</p>

<p>On was left with hearing loss and severe trauma but insisted on pressing charges -- resulting in a landmark ruling last month where, for the first time in South Korea, a court recognised misogyny as a motive for a hate crime.</p>

<p>"I now think I'm a feminist," On, who wanted to use her pen name for security reasons, told AFP in an interview.</p>

<p>The Changwon District Court ruling "has historical significance, but it seems to hold even greater meaning for me personally", she said.</p>

<p>The attack generated outrage in South Korea, and On became an inadvertent heroine for the country's women's rights movements.</p>

<p>Short hair has been very loosely associated with feminism in South Korea, which remains socially conservative despite its booming economy and the global popularity of its K-pop and K-drama content.</p>

<p>Same-sex marriage is not recognised, and among advanced economies it has relatively low rates of female workforce participation and one of the worst gender pay gaps.</p>

<p><strong>#MeToo, 4B Moments</strong></p>

<p>As part of the global #MeToo movement that emerged around 2017, South Korean women held enormous rights demonstrations and won victories on issues from abortion access to harsher punishment for spycam crimes.</p>

<p>Some campaigners went viral by destroying makeup products or cutting their hair short on camera to protest against the country's demanding beauty standards.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It also saw the emergence of the extreme 4B movement, which rejects dating, sex, marriage, or childbearing with men.</p>

<p>The movement, which means "Four Nos" in Korean, has been trending since Donald Trump won the US presidential election.</p>

<p>But South Korea has also seen a recent anti-feminism backlash, with President Yoon Suk Yeol courting young men on the campaign trail with denials of institutional discrimination against women and promises to abolish Ministry of Gender Equality, which his supporters claimed was "outdated".</p>

<p>The backlash previously ensnared unsuspecting victims such as triple Olympic archery champion An San, who was bullied online during the 2021 Tokyo Games for her short hair.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Writer On said she followed the furore at the time, even reporting online abuse she saw.&nbsp;"When I first heard that having short hair meant you were a feminist, I found it absurd," On said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Athletes often find it more convenient to have short hair when they are training," she added, noting she had cut her own hair short before being assaulted last year because of the hot weather.</p>

<p>Archer An never officially commented on the online abuse, and her "pride and confidence, along with her ability to simply ignore negativity, were truly impressive," said On.</p>

<p>"Over time, I found myself (inspired by) her sense of dignity and confidence... thinking: 'Is there really anything that I should be ashamed of?'"</p>

<p><strong>Getting Worse?</strong></p>

<p>A spate of high-profile deepfake pornography cases were uncovered this summer, targeting female students and staff at the country's schools and universities.</p>

<p>A Seoul court jailed one perpetrator for 10 years last month for assaulting women who attended the nation's top Seoul National University, saying his actions stemmed from "hatred toward socially successful women".</p>

<p>One victim, whose campaign name is Ruma, told AFP that her assailant "wanted to emphasise that no matter how accomplished a woman is, she can be trampled on and treated like a prank by men."</p>

<p>Activists such as Jung Yun-jung, who supported On through her trial, say the situation could worsen as inequality and competition for jobs increase.</p>

<p>South Korea has one of the world's lowest birthrates as well as a falling marriage rate, with experts pointing to intense competition over jobs and housing a factor, leaving young people despondent for their futures.</p>

<p>On is still on medication to treat the mental and physical wounds of her attack, but she has found purpose in supporting other women who may find themselves victimised in similar circumstances.</p>

<p>Feminism, in the end, is about believing that "women's rights are equally as important", she said.</p>

<p>"In that sense, I had indeed been a feminist even before the incident."</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The prankster claims that as many as seven schools fell prey to his prank and made the hats.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Vladislav Bokhan, an exiled Belarusian blogger and prankster, staunchly against the Kremlin, recently fooled Russian teachers by getting them to wear tinfoil hats and posing for photographs, according to a report in <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.thetimes.com/world/europe/article/russia-teachers-tricked-nato-plot-tinfoil-hats-70vmckpj7" rel="noindex, nofollow"><em>The Times</em></a>. Bokhan wrote letters to teachers in the Voronezh region, pretending to be from President Vladimir Putin's party and urged the teachers to make "Helmets of the Fatherland", claiming they would protect them from a malicious NATO plot. Bokhan said the prank was aimed at showing the absurdity of Putin's claim of liberating Ukraine from Nazis.</p>

<p>The letter declared that the tinfoil hats would provide protection against NATO satellites attempting to "irradiate the Russian people". To make the prank more convincing, Bokhan even referred to "United Russia" in the letter.</p>

<p>"Evil NATO members are planning to irradiate the Russian people physically and biologically. Therefore, our teachers will have to learn to resist this with the help of primitive means of protection, like a tinfoil hat," Bokhan <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://rtvi.com/news/pranker-ubedil-uchitelej-iz-rossii-sdelat-shapochki-iz-folgi-dlya-zashhity-ot-nato/" rel="noindex, nofollow">revealed </a>what he wrote in the letter on his YouTube channel.</p>

<p>"The goal of the master class is to strengthen patriotism, increase awareness and skills of teachers in the field of practical classes in civil defence, the ability to work with improvised materials to make primitive means of protection against the threat of the use of satellite and electronic equipment by NATO, and to develop skills in working with foil," the letter added.</p>

<p>The prankster claims that as many as seven schools fell prey to his prank and made the hats. One of the teachers also made a video, documenting the activity and explained why it was important.</p>

<p>"Making tinfoil hats is not only an interesting and creative activity but also an important patriotic act, symbolising a readiness to defend one's homeland from foreign threats," said the teacher.</p>

<p><strong><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/natos-big-warning-on-north-korea-russia-ties-threat-to-us-security-6964596" rel="noindex, nofollow">Also Read | "Threat To US Security": NATO's Big Warning On North Korea-Russia Ties</a></strong></p>

<h3><strong>Internet reacts</strong></h3>

<p>While some social media users commended the prank for its flawless execution, others sympathised with the teachers and said they were unnecessarily dragged into the issue.</p>

<p>"This is the most epic troll I've ever been lucky enough to see. I'm still wiping tears from my eyes," said one netizen, while another added: "Neat prank and the picture are worthy of being great memes."</p>

<p>A third commented: "Kinda sad tbh, a profession such as being a teacher falling for this just make my heart hurt a little, a lot of teachers from every country deserve better."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[As advisers and allies of Republican President-elect Donald Trump search for personnel to staff his coming administration, one quality is absolutely paramount: unquestioning loyalty.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As advisers and allies of Republican President-elect Donald Trump search for personnel to staff his coming administration, one quality is absolutely paramount: unquestioning loyalty.</p>

<p>During his 2017-2021 term, Trump butted heads with key appointees, particularly those in the intelligence, national security and law enforcement communities, several of whom later recounted slow-walking or trying to talk Trump out of his most controversial plans.</p>

<p>Without people around him who are inclined to push back, the president-elect may find it easier to bend longstanding norms in pursuit of his conservative agenda, both Trump supporters and opponents say.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On Thursday, Trump named his campaign chief, Susie Wiles, as White House chief of staff. And on Saturday, Trump said he would not invite back his former U.N. ambassador, Nikki Haley, nor his former secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, both of whom have criticized elements of Trump's conduct and policy, even as they tried to make amends in recent months.</p>

<p>Just days before the Nov. 5 election, one of Trump's former chiefs of staff, John Kelly, called him a "fascist" in an interview. One of his national security advisers, John Bolton, has repeatedly described Trump as unintelligent. And his second defense secretary, Mark Esper, recounted talking Trump out of bombing drug cartels in Mexico in his 2022 autobiography.</p>

<p>Trump has in return blasted those former cabinet-level officials, going so far as to suggest that his second joint chiefs of staff chairman, Mark Milley, should have been executed for treason. This time around, Trump has said only true believers in him - and in his "Make America Great Again" movement - will be allowed into government.</p>

<p>"President Trump has publicly said that he's learned from his first term," Mike Davis, a conservative attorney who frequently talks to the president-elect, told Reuters. Davis, who helped Trump get his Supreme Court picks through the Senate as a high-ranking Capitol Hill aide, has drawn frequent praise from Trump's most conservative allies.</p>

<p>"Political appointees require both competency and loyalty. You can't have just one or the other. You need both."</p>

<p>On X last week, Davis put it bluntly: "Before asking me for help, I am going to ask you to provide me specific and concrete evidence of your loyalty to Trump," he wrote. "If you cannot provide a lot of that, stop asking me."</p>

<p><strong>A Forensic Look</strong></p>

<p>To keep actors considered disloyal out of Trump's government, his transition team is taking a forensic look at every potential appointee for signs they might turn against their boss, even for lower-level appointees like assistant and deputy secretaries, according to two people involved in the effort.</p>

<p>Researchers contracted by Trump's transition team are sifting through potential appointees' past statements to see if they have ever spoken negatively about Trump, according to one of those people involved in the transition effort, who has direct knowledge of the matter. They are also checking if potential appointees have donated to Democrats - or even to Republicans who have sharply criticized the president-elect, that person said.</p>

<p>While such donations or negative statements are not necessarily disqualifiers, the person added, they are demerits.</p>

<p>Davis singled out the attorney general as a particularly crucial position.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Trump fired his first attorney general, Jeff Sessions, after he declined to shut down inquiries into contacts between Trump's 2016 campaign and Russian officials. Trump later said that hiring Sessions was his "biggest mistake."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Trump also fired his first FBI director, James Comey, under similar circumstances.</p>

<p>With a more loyal attorney general and FBI director, Trump allies say, he would be less likely to face damaging probes. Trump would also likely face less resistance if he tries to make good on campaign trail pledges to investigate opponents, including Democratic President Joe Biden, a matter of serious concern for Democrats and civil servants.</p>

<p>A spokesperson for Trump did not address the dynamics of how potential political appointees were being selected, beyond saying decisions on key appointments were imminent. Three appointments - White House chief of staff, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and border czar - have already been announced.</p>

<p>In a statement, the Democratic National Committee expressed concern that Trump was choosing loyalists they said would put Trump's interests over those of the nation.</p>

<p>"Instead of making sure agencies and law enforcement have the best and the brightest with the resources they need, Trump and his cronies are looking to dole out job offers to loyalists who will put Trump ahead of the American people," said Alex Floyd, a DNC spokesperson.</p>

<p><strong>Loyalty To Police - And The Man</strong></p>

<p>While it is normal for presidents to choose loyal allies for key appointments, the focus on loyalty over subject-matter expertise goes beyond the norm, according to interviews with five Trump advisers and public statements made by the president-elect's associates.</p>

<p>In many cabinets, presidents often reach out to the various wings of their own party so that distinct ideological factions have a seat at the table. Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, said on the trail that she would appoint a Republican to her cabinet.</p>

<p>"We're going to give people the role based on their capacity - and their fidelity and loyalty to the policy, as well as to the man," Howard Lutnick, the co-chair of Trump's transition effort, told the Financial Times last month.</p>

<p>One Trump adviser predicted the president-elect would bring much of his campaign to the White House, many members of whom have proven their loyalty in Trump's eyes by running a disciplined and tight-lipped campaign. Last time around, that adviser noted, Trump hired officials from the Republican National Committee.</p>

<p>"Loyalty is super important," said the Trump adviser, who was not authorized to speak to the media.</p>

<p>"There will be a lot more of the campaign staff that will transition over to the White House. Last time, a lot of party folks ended up in the White House, but their loyalty wasn't to the president. It was to themselves."</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What started with four Chinese students riding nearly 50 kilometres for soup dumplings turned into a night-time cycling trend, with thousands participating in it.</p>

<p>Dubbed the "Night Riding Great Army", the university students travelled on a straight road that connected Zhengzhou, the largest city in Henan province, with Kaifeng, an ancient city famed for its historic sites and soup dumplings.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-media-max-width="560">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">In China, a trend of night bike rides led by university students cycling from Zhengzhou to Kaifeng gained popularity, with over 17,000 students participating. Initially inspired by students seeking Kaifeng's famous soup dumplings.<br />
<br />
However, issues emerged, including traffic… <a href="https://t.co/BTvurkGLyB">pic.twitter.com/BTvurkGLyB</a></p>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>The authorities initially encouraged the trend to promote local tourism but soon scrambled to curb the craze. Police officials were deployed, and bike lanes were shut after its popularity went out of hand and the intercity traffic was brought to a standstill.</p>

<p>In a statement, the Kaifeng city government cited the risk of riders falling and sustaining injuries, or blocking other road users from accessing medical care.</p>

<p>"(You) have demonstrated the wilful whimsy of youth," it said, "but... more and more people are starting to worry about the hidden dangers".</p>

<p>While piles of discarded bikes overwhelmed several streets in Kaifeng, commuters in Zhengzhou struggled to find one for themselves to ride back home.<br />
<br />
Zhengkai Avenue, the main road connecting Zhengzhou with Kaifeng, was crammed with an endless flow of cyclists taking over the five car lanes in some sections.</p>

<p>The authorities in Kaifeng and Zhengzhou then closed bike lanes on Zhengkai Avenue over the weekend to stop the cyclists from entering the ancient city.</p>

<p>On social media, some students even claimed that the colleges and universities in Zhengzhou restricted students from leaving the campus to prevent them from joining the cycling crowd.<br />
<br />
Three major bike-sharing platforms in Zhengzhou issued a joint statement and warned people that their bikes would get locked down automatically if they were taken out of the city.</p>

<p>The trend reportedly started after four women college students from Zhengzhou decided to ride for several hours on shared bikes to reach Kaifeng in search of 'guan tang bao', the city's famous oversized soup dumplings.<br />
<br />
The posts from their journey later gained massive attention on social media, triggering a new trend on the Chinese streets.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[US President-elect Donald Trump has named Mike Waltz, a Congressman from Florida and co-chair of the India Caucus, as the new National Security Adviser.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President-elect Donald Trump has named Mike Waltz, a Congressman from Florida and co-chair of the India Caucus, as the new National Security Adviser. <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/donald-trump-appoints-mike-waltz-india-caucus-head-as-national-security-adviser-6998168">Mr Waltz's appointment</a> to such an important post hints at a positive future for US-India relations under Mr Trump's second presidency.<br />
<br />
<strong>Five key points in Mr Waltz's journey from military service to politics:</strong><br />
<br />
1) Early life and family background: Born in Boynton Beach, Florida, and raised by a single mother in Jacksonville, Mr Waltz grew up in a family with a strong military tradition. His grandfather served as Navy Chief.<br />
<br />
2) Military service: Mr Waltz's military journey began at the Virginia Military Institute from where he graduated before going on to serve as a Green Beret. He served 27 years in the US Army and National Guard, retiring during his second term in Congress. Mr Waltz completed multiple combat tours in Afghanistan, the Middle East and Africa.<br />
<br />
3) Political career: Serving in the US House of Representatives since 2019, Mr Waltz has been a vocal critic of President Joe Biden's foreign policy vis-a-vis China, Afghanistan and Ukraine. He criticised the 2021 US withdrawal from Afghanistan.<br />
<br />
4) Advocacy for strong foreign policy: Mr Waltz has consistently called for a stronger US foreign policy, especially in relation to China and Ukraine. He has urged Europe to increase its support for Ukraine amid the war with Russia, and, in the past, advocated for a US boycott of the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing due to China's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic.<br />
<br />
5) Personal life: Mike Waltz is also a proud family man. He is married to Dr. Julia Nesheiwat, a combat veteran who has served in multiple presidential administrations and was also the Homeland Security Advisor to President Trump. They have a daughter in college and a baby son.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Talks between WHO member states on a landmark global accord on handling future pandemics will roll into 2025 after countries decided Monday there were too many gaps to seal a deal this year.</p>

<p>The key faultlines in the negotiations are between Western nations with major pharmaceutical industry sectors, and poorer countries who do not want to be sidelined when the next pandemic strikes.</p>

<p>The negotiations, which kicked off in February 2022, are being held at the World Health Organization's headquarters in Geneva, between the WHO's 194 member states.</p>

<p>Countries "think they still have work to do", talks co-chair Anne-Claire Amprou told a press conference.</p>

<p>"Today member states agreed we need to conclude the agreement as soon as possible, and continue negotiations into 2025, with the goal of concluding the agreement by the next World Health Assembly scheduled in May.</p>

<p>"We are moving in the right direction," she insisted.</p>

<p>In December 2021, fearing a repeat of the devastation wrought by Covid-19 -- which killed millions of people, crippled health systems and crashed economies -- countries decided to draft a new accord on pandemic prevention, preparedness and response.</p>

<p>While much of the draft text has been agreed, disputes remain over some key provisions, notably over sharing access to pathogens with pandemic potential -- and then equitably sharing the benefits derived from them, such as vaccines, tests and treatments.</p>

<p>In June at the annual World Health Assembly -- the WHO's top decision-making body -- countries agreed to give themselves until the next assembly in May 2025 to conclude and adopt the agreement -- and to get it done by the end of the year if possible.</p>

<p>To finish this year, countries would have had to call the third-ever special session of the assembly in December -- with Monday the last possible day to make the decision.</p>

<p>However, countries accepted Monday they were not in a position to have the agreement's text finished so soon.</p>

<p>And the return of Donald Trump to the US presidency also risks further shaking up the process. In his first term, he began pulling the United States out of the WHO before current President Joe Biden reversed the decision.</p>

<p>The two-week, 12th round of talks began on November 4, but the first week concluded Friday with little progress achieved on agreeing outstanding articles under discussion.</p>

<p>Talks co-chair Precious Matsoso said that all countries want to be better prepared and prevent the next disaster from happening.</p>

<p>"Our biggest fear though is that when the next pandemic happens, it will be more severe than what we experienced with Covid-19," she said.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A nine-year study published last month found that elephants avoided farms with the ferocious bees 86 percent of the time.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>"We used to hate elephants a lot," Kenyan farmer Charity Mwangome says, pausing from her work under the shade of a baobab tree.</p>

<p>The bees humming in the background are part of the reason why her hatred has dimmed.</p>

<p>The diminutive 58-year-old said rapacious elephants would often destroy months of work in her farmland that sits between two parts of Kenya's world-renowned Tsavo National Park.</p>

<p>Beloved by tourists -- who contribute around 10 percent of Kenya's GDP -- the animals are loathed by most local farmers, who form the backbone of the nation's economy.</p>

<p>Elephant conservation has been a roaring success: numbers in Tsavo rose from around 6,000 in the mid-1990s to almost 15,000 elephants in 2021, according to the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS).</p>

<p>But the human population also expanded, encroaching on grazing and migration routes for the herds.</p>

<p>Resulting clashes are becoming the number one cause of elephant deaths, says KWS.</p>

<p>Refused compensation when she lost her crops, Mwangome admits she was mad with the conservationists.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But a long-running project by charity Save the Elephants offered her an unlikely solution -- deterring some of nature's biggest animals with some of its smallest: African honeybees.</p>

<p>Cheery yellow beehive fences now protect several local plots, including Mwangome's.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A nine-year study published last month found that elephants avoided farms with the ferocious bees 86 percent of the time.</p>

<p>"The beehive fences came to our rescue," said Mwangome.</p>

<p><strong>Hacking Nature</strong></p>

<p>The deep humming of 70,000 bees is enough to make many flee, including a six-tonne elephant, but Loise Kawira calmly removes a tray in her apiary to demonstrate the intricate combs of wax and honey.</p>

<p>Kawira, who joined Save the Elephants in 2021 as their consultant beekeeper, trains and monitors farmers in the delicate art.</p>

<p>The project supports 49 farmers, whose plots are surrounded by 15 connected hives.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Each is strung on greased wire a few metres off the ground, which protects them from badgers and insects, but also means they shake when disturbed by a hungry elephant.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Once the elephants hear the sound of the bees and the smell, they run away," Kawira told AFP.</p>

<p>"It hacks the interaction between elephants and bees," added Ewan Brennan, local project coordinator.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It has been effective, but recent droughts, exacerbated by climate change, have raised challenges.</p>

<p>"(In) the total heat, the dryness, bees have absconded," said Kawira.</p>

<p>It is also expensive -- about 150,000 Kenyan shillings ($1,100) to install hives -- well beyond the means of subsistence farmers, though the project organisers say it is still cheaper than electric fences.</p>

<p><strong>'I Was Going To Die'</strong></p>

<p>Just moments after AFP arrived at Mwanajuma Kibula's farm, which abuts one of the Tsavo parks, her beehive fence had seen off an elephant.</p>

<p>The five-tonne animal, its skin caked in red mud, rumbled into the area and then did an abrupt about-face.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I know my crops are protected," Kibula said with palpable relief.</p>

<p>Kibula, 48, also harvests honey twice a year from her hives, making 450 shillings per jar -- enough to pay school fees for her children.</p>

<p>She is fortunate to have protection from the biggest land mammals on Earth.</p>

<p>"An elephant ripped off my roof, I had to hide under the bed because I knew I was going to die," said a less-fortunate neighbour, Hendrita Mwalada, 67.</p>

<p>For those who can't afford bees, Save the Elephants offers other solutions, such as metal-sheet fences that clatter when shaken by approaching elephants, and diesel- or chilli-soaked rags that deter them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is not always enough.&nbsp;"I have tried planting but every time the crops are ready, the elephants come and destroy the crops," Mwalada told AFP.</p>

<p>"That has been the story of my life, a life full of too much struggling."</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Ryanair flight from Tirana, Albania, to Manchester Airport made an emergency landing at London Stansted on Sunday, November 10, after a passenger died onboard. The flight, which had already crossed Switzerland and France, diverted shortly before 8 pm, according to <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://metro.co.uk/2024/11/11/ryanair-flight-manchester-engulfed-chaos-man-suddenly-dies-mid-air-21972642/#:~:text=A%20Ryanair%20flight%20was%20forced,medical%20emergency'%20mid%2Dair." rel="nofollow, noindex">Metro.&nbsp;</a></em>Upon landing, emergency crews, including paramedics, police, and an air ambulance, met the aircraft. Despite their efforts, the man, whose age and identity have not been disclosed, was pronounced dead on the scene.</p>

<p>The incident caused considerable disruption onboard as passengers grappled with the unexpected situation.&nbsp;According to an eyewitness, the man began "having convulsions" before crew members rushed to his aid, moving him to the aisle where CPR was administered in a desperate bid to save his life.</p>

<p>"He stopped breathing and everything went into chaos. A few of us with first aid training jumped in to help and started CPR while the defibrillator was set. Two aircrew members and three passengers managed to keep doing CPR as instructed by the defibrillator for 25 minutes when we finally landed in an emergency in London," he told the&nbsp;<em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/everything-went-chaos-horror-ryanair-30348173" rel="nofollow, noindex">Manchester Evening News</a></em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/everything-went-chaos-horror-ryanair-30348173" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>.&nbsp;</em></a></p>

<p>"The paramedics continued for another 30 minutes when we were all instructed to leave the plane. After about another hour, the ambulance was still there but we boarded again with a new aircrew to continue the trip to Manchester, without the man and his friends. I asked and was told that, unfortunately, the man did not make it. I was devastated to learn the sad news," he added.</p>

<p>A spokesperson for the East of England Ambulance Service said: "One ambulance, one Hazardous Area Response Team vehicle, one paramedic car and Essex and Herts Air Ambulance were called to Stansted Airport on Sunday evening following reports of a man with a medical emergency on an aircraft. Sadly, despite the best efforts of all involved, the man had died at the scene."</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Thai woman has been experiencing nearly two decades of constant, stinging pain after a suture needle was left in her vagina post-childbirth, according to a report in <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scmp.com/news/people-culture/article/3285795/thai-woman-suffers-18-years-pain-after-childbirth-finds-needle-left-vagina-during-suturing" rel="noindex, nofollow">SCMP</a></em>. The 36-year-old woman from the Cho Airong district in the Narathiwat province has been suffering severe abdominal discomfort since then but unable to find any treatment. She approached the village headman Aruman Waenogi, earlier this month, who in turn contacted a non-profit organisation (NGO) named Pavena Foundation for Children and Women for help.</p>

<p>The NGO, dedicated to assisting victims of abuse. rape, harassment and human trafficking took note of the issue and started coordinating with the Narathiwat Provincial Public Health Office.</p>

<p>According to the NGO, 18 years ago, the nurse dropped a needle in the victim's vagina when she was receiving stitches. The doctor attempted to fish it out using his fingers but could not retrieve it. Worried about the excessive bleeding, the doctor opted to close the wound, leaving the needle stuck inside. It wasn't until 2023 that the woman, troubled by the pain, went to have an X-ray at a government hospital and discovered the needle.</p>

<h3><strong>No surgery yet</strong></h3>

<p>As of the last update, the woman had no surgery officially scheduled but was required to visit the hospital four times a month for regular monitoring. "Currently, the young woman still has to travel to the hospital about 3-4 times a month. Even though she uses the gold card for treatment, there are travel expenses," the NGO stated.</p>

<p>The NGO has contacted the local security office to arrange for hospital visits and pledged to continue following up on her care. It is also unclear as to whether she will take legal action against the hospital and doctor who left the needle inside her, leading to lifelong problems.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli researchers and their colleagues from the United States developed an antibody-based treatment that empowers the body's immune system to effectively attack cancer cells and prevent their spread, Israel's Weizmann Institute of Science (WIS) said in a statement on Monday.</p>

<p>WIS-led scientists revealed that a form of breast cancer known as triple-negative breast cancer encourages nearby immune cells to form "molecular bridges." These bridges prevent immune cells from attacking the tumor, resulting in immune suppression.</p>

<p>The research team demonstrated that an antibody treatment blocking the formation of these bridges can revive the immune system's ability to mount a robust attack on cancer cells, halting tumor progression in mouse models. They explained that while the breast cancer cells themselves express very low levels of the protein CD84, which is used to build the bridges, they induce nearby immune cells to produce large quantities of this protein, creating the bridges that suppress the immune response.</p>

<p>The study also found that higher levels of CD84 in patients' tumors were linked to shorter survival times. Experiments with genetically engineered mice lacking CD84 revealed smaller tumor growth, highlighting how CD84 within the tumor environment suppresses T cell activity in the immune system.</p>

<p>Administered twice weekly in mice with developing breast cancer, the antibody significantly slowed tumor growth and, in some cases, led to full recovery.</p>

<p>The team noted that the antibody selectively targets cells with elevated CD84 levels, sparing healthy immune cells, which express this protein at lower levels, Xinhua news agency reported.</p>

<p>The researchers suggested that this treatment approach could be applied to various cancer types byfocusing on the tumor microenvironment rather than the cancer cells themselves.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President-elect Donald Trump on Tuesday said it is time to reclaim America's educational institutions from the radical Left, adding that the accreditation system will be used to achieve this end.</p>

<p>He said that on assuming the Presidential post on January 20 next year, Mr Trump will fire "radical Left" accreditors that have allowed colleges to be dominated by "Marxists, maniacs and lunatics". In an over two-minute-long statement, also shared by SpaceX and Tesla founder Elon Musk, Mr Trump accused academics of being obsessed with indoctrinating America's youth, while tuition fees continue to skyrocket.</p>

<p>The Republican said his administration will appoint new accreditors, who will impose real standards including "defending the American tradition in Western civilization, protecting free speech, eliminating wasteful administrative positions that drive up costs, incredibly, removing all Marxist diversity, equity and inclusion bureaucrats, offering options for accelerated and low cost degrees, providing meaningful job placement and career services, and implementing college entrance and exit exams to prove that students are actually learning".</p>

<p>He went on to reiterate his resolve to get the "anti-American insanity" out of institutions run on hundreds of billions of dollars from hard-working taxpayers.</p>

<p>Mr Trump also said he will direct the Department of Justice to pursue federal civil rights cases against schools that continue to engage in racial discrimination. Further, to penalise schools engaging in unlawful discrimination "under the guise of equity", he said he will bring in a law that will fine institutions up to the entire amount of their endowment.</p>

<p>Mr Trump's Agenda47 mentions closing the Department of Education, while also proposing cutting funding for any school teaching critical race theory or "transgender insanity" and credentialing teachers who "embrace patriotic values and support the American Way of Life".</p>

<p>His statements came months after fierce pro-Palestine protests rocked campuses across the US, including Harvard, New York University, Yale, Emerson College and Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Amidst heightened diplomatic tensions between Canada and India, Elon Musk's reaction to posts on Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has resonated with many social media users in India. In recent days, the billionaire has replied to or quoted several posts on X that criticise Mr Trudeau. Last week, Mr Musk predicted Justin Trudeau's downfall in the upcoming election, which is set to take place on or before October next year. "He will be gone in the upcoming election," Mr Musk wrote on X while responding to a user's request to help Canada get rid of Mr Trudeau.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>The billionaire also reshared another post showing a graph on how Canada's GDP per capita has fallen under the Trudeau government. "Wow," he wrote while reacting to the tweet.</p>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Reacting to Mr Musk's tweets, one Indian X user wrote, "He (Justin Trudeau) is another woke virus run by Khalistani terrorists. He has no respect anywhere." "We agree with you," said another.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Cannot wait! Trudeau is a disaster! commented X user Udayan Mukherjee. "Hope your words turn into reality next yr," said user Shubham Chaudhary.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mr Musk slammed the Justin Trudeau government last year as well for "crushing free speech" in the country. After the Canadian government made it compulsory for online streaming services to formally register with the government for "regulatory controls", Mr Musk called this policy "shameful" and wrote, "Trudeau is trying to crush free speech in Canada".</p>

<p>Before this, in February 2022, when Mr Trudeau invoked emergency powers - for the first time in the country's history - to arm his government with more power to respond to truckers protesting the vaccine mandates at that time, the billionaire compared him to Adolf Hitler.</p>

<p>Responding to an X post describing how Trudeau's government had ordered banks to help cut funding to the protesters, Mr Musk posted a meme of a photo of Hitler, with "Stop comparing me to Justin Trudeau" written above his head and "I had a budget" below it.</p>

<p>These comments by Mr Musk come amidst heightened political and diplomatic tensions between India and Canada. India has raised concerns over extremism and anti-India activities within Canada, calling for action to counter these issues. The strained ties worsened following accusations by Canadian leaders about the killing of Khalistan terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar, leading India to recall its High Commissioner.</p>

<p>Moreover, in the past few months, the Indian community in Canada has also experienced a surge in violence and hostility, with reports ranging from vandalism of temples to verbal and physical assaults on individuals.</p>

<p>These recent events have raised alarm among Indian communities and their supporters. So naturally, Mr Musk's criticism of the Justin Trudeau government has resonated with many Indians, likely giving his popularity a boost in India.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prince Harry and Meghan Markle delivered a message focusing on the urgent need to protect children in today's digital landscape and what they plan to do in this direction through their Archewell Foundation, reported the <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/11/entertainment/prince-harry-and-meghan-markle-share-new-video-message-we-are-at-a-crossroads/">New York Post.</a></p>

<p>They addressed their work on online child safety in a video message shared at a United Nations conference in Colombia.</p>

<p>Harry, 40, expressed the necessity for society to prioritise children's online safety, saying, “We are at a crossroads. The urgency to reassess and redefine our approach to protecting children has become increasingly evident. While the necessity has always been apparent, it's now time to translate that awareness into meaningful action.</p>

<p>He highlighted that while digital platforms offer tools to shield children from harm, they can also introduce “new risks, such as from individuals who exploit gaps in our outdated legal systems, which often don't account for today's digital realities.”</p>

<p>Harry noted the importance of parental support in mitigating digital violence, referencing the Archewell Foundation's initiative. “We know that supporting parents is essential in reducing digital violence against children, that's why earlier this year we launched the Parents' Network,” The New York Post quoted him as saying.</p>

<p>Meghan, 43, reflected on the complex nature of digital connectivity. According to the New York Post, she said, “My husband and I recognise that today's reality is marked by greater connectivity and advanced technology, which, of course, has many positives.” She went on to add, “However, it also compels us to better understand how digital violence against children is manifesting itself in this age.”</p>

<p>Meghan then described Archewell's global engagement with young people, families, and experts, working to understand how the digital world impacts children's lives. “At the Archewell Foundation, we engage with young people, families and experts worldwide, learning about how every aspect of a child's life — from their livelihood to their physical and mental well-being — now operates within an online economy that has both the power to shape and misshape our connections,” she said.</p>

<p>This was the first time the Duke and Duchess of Sussex appeared together publicly since their trip to Colombia in August 2024.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Israeli military has said it struck a rocket launcher in southern Lebanon after a barrage of 90 rockets crossed into the country from Lebanon, injuring three people.</p>

<p>The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement that Hezbollah militants in Lebanon fired approximately 80 projectiles within five minutes at the Krayot, a cluster of towns north of Haifa, and the Galilee region, Xinhua news agency reported.</p>

<p>"Most of the projectiles were intercepted, and fallen projectiles were identified in the area," the military said, adding that two explosive drones from Lebanon were also intercepted in the Galilee area.</p>

<p>A few minutes later, another barrage of 10 rockets targeted the Western Galilee and Krayot, with some landing in open fields, the IDF noted.</p>

<p>Israel's Magen David Adom rescue service reported that strikes were identified in at least nine locations, injuring a 17-year-old boy, a 52-year-old man, and a 75-year-old man. Another man sustained injuries while rushing to a shelter.</p>

<p>Israel's National Fire and Rescue Authority reported that rockets set fire to several vehicles, with one projectile striking an apartment and another hitting a bus stop, causing damage.</p>

<p>Throughout Monday, a total of about 175 rockets have been fired by Hezbollah forces at northern Israel, according to the IDF.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Amid fears of an "extremely high level of violent protests," the Brampton Triveni Mandir and Community Centre has cancelled a Life Certificate Event.</p>

<p>The event, a consular camp, was scheduled to take place on November 17, where Indian-origin Hindus and Sikhs could renew essential life certificates.</p>

<p>The temple administration issued a statement on Monday, saying, "Please be advised that the Life Certificate Event scheduled at Brampton Triveni Mandir by the Indian Consulate on November 17, 2024, has been cancelled. This is due to official intelligence from Peel Regional Police, stating that there is an Extremely High and Imminent Threat Level of violent protests."</p>

<p>The authorities appologized to the community members, stating, "We apologize to all community members who were depending on the event. We are deeply saddened that Canadians now feel unsafe coming to Hindu Temples in Canada."</p>

<p>"We call on Peel Police to address the threats being circulated against Brampton Triveni Mandir and provide security guarantees to the Canadian Hindu Community and the general public," the temple administration added.</p>

<p>Brampton Triveni Mandir and Community Centre is a spiritual place for the gathering of all Hindus and like-minded people gather to participate in Puja, Kirtan, Sewa and Pravachan.</p>

<p>On November 3, an Indian consular camp at the Hindu Sabha Temple in Brampton, near Toronto, witnessed a "violent disruption". The incident sparked widespread criticism in and outside Canada.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi condemned the "deliberate attack" on Hindu temple in Canada and said that "cowardly attempts to intimidate" Indian diplomats were appalling and New Delhi expects Canadian authorities to ensure justice and uphold rule of law.</p>

<p>"I strongly condemn the deliberate attack on a Hindu temple in Canada. Equally appalling are the cowardly attempts to intimidate our diplomats. Such acts of violence will never weaken India's resolve. We expect the Canadian government to ensure justice and uphold the rule of law," PM Modi said on X.</p>

<p>The ties between India and Canada took sharp downturn following Canadian leaders making allegations without providing evidence about an assassination on their soil.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The nomination of the hawkish congressman, who has Cuban heritage, would cap a remarkable turnaround in his relations with Trump.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President-elect Donald Trump is expected to name Florida Senator Marco Rubio as secretary of state, The New York Times reported Monday night. It quoted three people as saying that the decision is not final, but that Trump appears to have settled on Rubio, a loyalist whom Trump passed over as his vice presidential running mate.</p>

<p>Rubio has been consistently named over the last week as one of the frontrunners to head US diplomacy, along with the abrasive former ambassador to Germany, Ric Grenell.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Asked if he was destined for a senior cabinet job, Rubio told CNN last week, "I always am interested in serving this country."&nbsp;</p>

<p>The nomination of the hawkish congressman, who has Cuban heritage, would cap a remarkable turnaround in his relations with Trump.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In 2016, when they were competing for the Republican presidential nomination, Rubio called Trump a "con artist" and the "most vulgar person to ever aspire to the presidency."</p>

<p>Born to Cuban immigrants in Miami, he graduated with a political science degree from the University of Florida in 1993.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He was elected to the US Senate in 2010 with his campaign buoyed by the Tea Party, a far-right contingent of Republicans that coalesced in the aftermath of Barack Obama's election as president.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the most significant appointment yet for India from the incoming administration of President-elect Donald Trump on Monday announced Mike Waltz, a Congressman from Florida who is the co-chair of the India Caucus, as his new National Security Adviser.</p>

<p>Waltz, 50, is a retired Army colonel who served as a Green Beret, an elite special forces unit of the US Army.</p>

<p>He has been a member of the US House of Representatives since 2019. He has been a forceful critic of President Joe Biden's foreign policy and serves on the House Armed Services Committee, House Foreign Affairs Committee, and the House Intelligence Committee this term.</p>

<p>He has called for Europe to do more to support Ukraine and for the US to be more stringent with its support, aligning with a key foreign policy goal of the President-elect. He has also been a staunch critic of the Biden administration's 2021 withdrawal from Afghanistan.</p>

<p>Waltz has praised Trump for pushing Nato allies to spend more on defence, but unlike the President-elect has not suggested the US pull out of the alliance.</p>

<p>"Look we can be allies and friends and have tough conversations," Waltz said last month</p>

<p>Waltz is also on the Republican's China taskforce and has argued the US military is not as prepared as it needs to be if there is conflict in the Indo-Pacific region.</p>

<p>Waltz had been open about his willingness to serve in the administration and was considered a candidate to lead the Pentagon. The role of National Security Adviser does not require Senate confirmation.</p>

<p>Waltz is also a co-chair of the India Caucus in the House, which is the largest country-specific group in the US Congress.</p>

<p>Trump has been moving swiftly to announce key personnel of his incoming administration, including Susan Wiles, his White House Chief of Staff who will be the first woman to hold the position.</p>

<p>Trump's other appointments include Stephen Miller, as a senior adviser, who is a known critic of the H-1b visa programme which he tried to kill in Trump's first administration.</p>

<p>The President-elect has been quickly assembling a roster of senior staff since winning last week's election. He has already announced Tom Homan as his "border czar," Elise Stefanik as US ambassador to the United Nations, and Lee Zeldin as administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;Israel bombed central Beirut in the early hours of Thursday, killing at least six people, after its forces suffered their deadliest day on the Lebanese front in a year of clashes against Iran-backed armed group Hezbollah.</p>

<p>Israel said it conducted a precise air strike on Beirut. Reuters witnesses reported hearing a massive blast, and a security source said it targeted a building in central Beirut's Bachoura neighbourhood close to parliament, the nearest Israeli strikes have come to Lebanon's seat of government.</p>

<p>At least six people were killed and seven wounded, Lebanese health officials said. A photo being circulated on Lebanese WhatsApp groups, which Reuters could not immediately verify, showed a heavily damaged building with its first floor on fire.</p>

<p>Three missiles also hit the southern suburb of Dahiyeh, where Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah was killed last week, and loud explosions were heard, Lebanese security officials said. The southern suburbs came under more than a dozen Israeli strikes on Wednesday.</p>

<p>A day after Iran fired more than 180 missiles into Israel, Israel said on Wednesday eight soldiers were killed in ground combat in south Lebanon as its forces thrust into its northern neighbour.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said regular infantry and armoured units joined its ground operations in Lebanon on Wednesday as Iran's missile attack and Israel's promise of retaliation raised concerns that the oil-producing Middle East could be caught up in a wider conflict.</p>

<p>Hezbollah said its fighters engaged Israeli forces inside Lebanon. The movement reported ground clashes for the first time since Israeli forces pushed over the border on Monday. Hezbollah said it had destroyed three Israeli Merkava tanks with rockets near the border town of Maroun El Ras.</p>

<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in a condolence video, said: "We are at the height of a difficult war against Iran's Axis of Evil, which wants to destroy us.</p>

<p>"This will not happen because we will stand together and with God's help, we will win together," he said.</p>

<p>Lebanon's health ministry said Israeli air raids killed at least 46 people in the south and centre of the country over the past 24 hours.</p>

<p>Iran said on Wednesday its missile volley - its biggest ever assault on Israel - was over barring further provocation, but Israel and the United States promised to hit back hard.</p>

<p>U.S. President Joe Biden said he would not support any Israeli strike on Iran's nuclear sites in response to its ballistic missile attack and urged Israel to act "proportionally" against its regional arch-foe.</p>

<p>Biden joined a call with Group of Seven major power leaders on Wednesday to coordinate a response, including new sanctions against Tehran, the White House said.</p>

<p>G7 leaders voiced "strong concern" over the Middle East crisis but said a diplomatic solution was still viable and a region-wide conflict was in no one's interest, a statement said.</p>

<p>Hezbollah said it repelled Israeli forces near several border towns and also fired rockets at military posts inside Israel.</p>

<p>The paramilitary group's media chief Mohammad Afif said those battles were only "the first round" and that Hezbollah had enough fighters, weapons and ammunition to push back Israel.</p>

<p>Israel's addition of infantry and armoured troops from the 36th Division, including the Golani Brigade, the 188th Armoured Brigade and 6th Infantry Brigade, suggested that the operation might expand beyond limited commando raids.</p>

<p>The military has said its incursion is largely aimed at destroying tunnels and other infrastructure on the border and there were no plans for a wider operation targeting the Lebanese capital Beirut to the north or major cities in the south.</p>

<p><strong>1.2 MILLION LEBANESE DISPLACED</strong></p>

<p>Nevertheless, it issued new evacuation orders for around two dozen towns along the southern border, instructing inhabitants to head north of the Awali River, which flows east to west some 60 km (37 miles) north of the Israeli frontier.</p>

<p>More than 1,900 people have been killed and over 9,000 wounded in Lebanon in almost a year of cross-border fighting, with most of the deaths occurring in the past two weeks, according to Lebanese government statistics.</p>

<p>Caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati said that about 1.2 million Lebanese had been displaced by Israeli attacks.</p>

<p>Malika Joumaa, from Sudan, was forced to take shelter in Saint Joseph's church in Beirut after being forced from her house near Sidon in coastal south Lebanon with her husband and two children.</p>

<p>"It's good that the church offered its help. We were going to stay in the streets; where would we have gone?"</p>

<p>Iran described Tuesday's missile assault as a response to Israeli killings of militant leaders, including Nasrallah, attacks in Lebanon against the group and Israel's war against Palestinian Hamas militants in Gaza.</p>

<p>There were no casualties from the missile onslaught in Israel, but one person was killed in the occupied West Bank.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[One of two doctors charged in connection with the drug overdose death of "Friends" star Matthew Perry pleaded guilty in a US court on Wednesday.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of two doctors charged in connection with the drug overdose death of "Friends" star Matthew Perry pleaded guilty in a US court on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Mark Chavez, 54, faces up to 10 years in prison after admitting to conspiring to distribute ketamine in the weeks before the actor was found dead in the pool of his Los Angeles home.</p>

<p>Appearing before US District Judge Sherilyn Peace Garnett in a Los Angeles court, the bespectacled Chavez answered a series of questions before entering his plea of "Guilty, your honor."</p>

<p>Perry's lengthy struggles with substance addiction were well-documented, but his death in October 2023 sent shockwaves through the global legions of "Friends" fans.</p>

<p>A criminal investigation was launched soon after an autopsy discovered the actor had high levels of ketamine -- an anesthetic -- in his system.</p>

<p>Two others caught in the dragnet -- a live-in assistant and an acquaintance -- have already pleaded guilty to their charges.</p>

<p>Another doctor -- Salvador Plasencia -- allegedly bought ketamine off Chavez and sold it to the desperate star at hugely inflated prices, musing "I wonder how much this moron will pay."</p>

<p>Jasveen Sangha, the alleged "Ketamine Queen" who supplied drugs to high-end clients and celebrities, is charged with selling Perry the dose that killed him.</p>

<p>Both Plasencia and Sangha face one count of conspiracy to distribute ketamine, as well as a raft of other charges, which they have denied.</p>

<p>Their trials have been set for March, and both face lengthy prison terms if found guilty.</p>

<p>Chavez admitted in his plea agreement to selling ketamine to Plasencia, including doses that he had diverted from his former ketamine clinic.</p>

<p>He was released on $50,000 bail on Wednesday and ordered not to practice medicine. He is expected to be sentenced in April.</p>

<p>Perry played Chandler Bing on the hit TV sitcom from 1994 to 2004 and talked openly of his decades-long battles with addiction.</p>

<p>He had been taking ketamine, a controlled drug, as part of supervised therapy.</p>

<p>Doctors and veterinarians use ketamine as an anesthetic, and researchers have explored its use as a treatment for depression.</p>

<p>Underground users take it for its hallucinogenic effects, though it can be addictive and dangerous for people with underlying health problems.</p>

<p>"Friends," which followed the lives of six New Yorkers navigating adulthood, dating and careers, drew a massive global following and made megastars of previously unknown actors.</p>

<p>Perry's role as the sarcastic man-child Chandler brought him fabulous wealth, but hid a dark struggle with addiction to painkillers and alcohol.</p>

<p>In 2018, he suffered a drug-related burst colon and underwent multiple surgeries.</p>

<p>In his 2022 memoir "Friends, Lovers and the Big Terrible Thing," Perry described going through detox dozens of times.</p>

<p>"I have mostly been sober since 2001," he wrote, "save for about sixty or seventy little mishaps."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A U.S. resident from Dearborn, Michigan, has been killed in Lebanon, the American government said on Wednesday, with the man's friend and neighbors saying he died in an Israeli airstrike.</p>

<p>"We are deeply saddened by the death of Kamel Ahmad Jawad and our hearts go out to his family and friends. His death is a tragedy, as are the deaths of many civilians in Lebanon," a White House spokesperson said.</p>

<p>Earlier in the day, a State Department spokesperson, when asked about reports of an American's death in Lebanon, said: "It's our understanding that it was a legal permanent resident, not an American citizen (who got killed in Lebanon) but we obviously offer our sincerest condolences to the family."</p>

<p>Israel's recent military campaign in Lebanon has killed hundreds, wounded thousands and displaced over a million. Israel says it is targeting Iran-backed Hezbollah militants.</p>

<p>Jawad was in Lebanon taking care of his elderly mother, according to the Detroit News. His friend Hamzah Raza and local Dearborn groups said on social media that Jawad was killed in an Israeli air strike and called him "one of the kindest and most generous humans."</p>

<p>Reuters was unable to confirm the circumstances of Jawad's death.</p>

<p>Washington has faced criticism in some quarters for its support of its ally Israel, which is also waging a war in Gaza, including in Dearborn where there is a large Arab American population.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Donald Trump launched a "private criminal effort" to subvert the 2020 US election and should not be shielded by presidential immunity, Special Counsel Jack Smith said in a court filing unsealed on Wednesday.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump launched a "private criminal effort" to subvert the 2020 US election and should not be shielded by presidential immunity, Special Counsel Jack Smith said in a court filing unsealed on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Smith, in a 165-page motion arguing for the historic case against Trump to move forward, also provided new evidence of the former president's efforts to overturn the results of the election won by Democrat Joe Biden.</p>

<p>Trump, the Republican candidate in November's White House election, had been scheduled to go on trial in March but the case was frozen while his lawyers argued that a former president should be immune from criminal prosecution.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court ruled in July that an ex-president has broad immunity from prosecution for official acts conducted while in office, but can be pursued for unofficial acts.</p>

<p>Smith, in the filing unsealed by District Court Judge Tanya Chutkan, who is hearing the case, said Trump should not escape prosecution because "at its core, the defendant's scheme was a private criminal effort."</p>

<p>"The defendant asserts that he is immune from prosecution for his criminal scheme to overturn the 2020 presidential election because, he claims, it entailed official conduct," Smith said. "Not so."</p>

<p>"Although the defendant was the incumbent President during the charged conspiracies, his scheme was fundamentally a private one."</p>

<p>Trump, acting as a candidate and not in his official capacity, "resorted to crimes to try to stay in office," the special counsel said.</p>

<p>"With private co-conspirators, the defendant launched a series of increasingly desperate plans to overturn the legitimate election results in seven states that he had lost," he said.</p>

<p>Trump's efforts allegedly included lying to state officials, manufacturing fraudulent electoral votes and seeking to get Vice President Mike Pence to obstruct Congressional certification of Biden's victory.</p>

<p>"When all else had failed," the special counsel said, Trump directed an "angry crowd" of supporters to the US Capitol on January 6, 2021.</p>

<p><strong>- 'Crazy' -</strong></p>

<p>Smith said there was abundant evidence that Trump knew his claims of electoral fraud were false because close advisers had told him so.</p>

<p>The former president even dismissed some of the most far-fetched fraud claims advanced by his supporters as "crazy," he said.</p>

<p>Smith said Trump -- frustrated with the failure of his election challenges -- engaged "a private attorney who was willing to falsely claim victory and spread knowingly false claims of election fraud."</p>

<p>The attorney, while not named in the filing, appeared to be former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani.</p>

<p>Chutkan has not set a date for a trial but it will not be held before the November 5 election between Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris.</p>

<p>Trump is accused of conspiracy to defraud the United States and conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding -- the session of Congress that was violently attacked by Trump supporters.</p>

<p>The former president is also accused of seeking to disenfranchise US voters with his false claims that he won the 2020 election.</p>

<p>Trump was convicted in New York in May of 34 counts of falsifying business records to cover up hush money payments made to porn star Stormy Daniels.</p>

<p>He also faces charges in Georgia related to efforts to overturn the 2020 election</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Democratic Vice Presidential candidate Tim Walz and his Republican rival JD Vance debated each other on Wednesday as millions of Americans tuned in to the first, and most-likely, only vice-presidential debate before the country votes on November 5.</p>

<p>Unlike the presidential debate, which saw personal attacks by the contenders, the vice presidential debate was calm, structured and surprisingly civil as Mr Vance and Mr Walz engaged in debating mostly policy issues.</p>

<p>Instead of indulging in slander, both candidates stuck to criticism of the opposing presidential candidate. The debate came as a surprise to most, especially after a months-long ugly and divisive election campaign - that saw personal attacks, derogatory language, racist slurs, inflammatory rhetoric and even assassination attempts.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="The US Vice Presidential debate was calm, structured and surprisingly civil." id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-10/t0evepcs_tim-walz-vs-jd-vance-us-vice-presidential-debate-reuters_625x300_03_October_24.jpg" title="The US Vice Presidential debate was calm, structured and surprisingly civil." /></div>

<p class="ins_instory_dv_caption"><small><em>The US Vice Presidential debate between JD Vance and Tim Walz was calm, structured and surprisingly civil.</em></small></p>
</div>

<p>Mr Vance and Mr Walz too, have in the past, attacked each other during the election campaign, but for the vice-presidential debate, they struck a respectful tone.</p>

<h2><strong>THE MOST HEATED EXCHANGE OF THE DEBATE</strong></h2>

<p>The debate was cordial and focused mostly on policy matters but saw some tense moments towards the end when a question was asked to the Republican candidate on whether he agrees that Donald Trump lost the 2020 US election.</p>

<p>During the debate Mr Vance, who has said that he would not have voted to certify the result of the previous presidential election, evaded the question when asked if he would challenge this year's vote if Donald Trump loses the election.</p>

<p>To this Mr Walz responded by blaming Donald Trump's false claims of voter fraud which had instigated a mob attack on the US Capitol in January, 2021, which was an attempt to prevent the certification of Joe Biden's election win in 2020.</p>

<p>Blaming Mr Vance, Mr Walz said, "He is still saying he (Tump) didn't lose the election,". He then directly questioned his rival by asking, "Did he (Trump) lose the 2020 election?" When the Republican candidate again dodged the question and went on to accuse Kamala Harris of pursuing online censorship of opposing views, the debate was at its most intense exchange.</p>

<p>"That's a damning non-answer," Mr Walz exclaimed.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Slamming JD Vance, Tim Walz said, &quot;He is still saying he (Tump) didnt lose the 2020 election&quot;." id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-10/d1ernbhk_tim-walz-vs-jd-vance-us-vice-presidential-debate-reuters_625x300_03_October_24.jpg" title="Slamming JD Vance, Tim Walz said, &quot;He is still saying he (Tump) didnt lose the 2020 election&quot;." /></div>

<p class="ins_instory_dv_caption"><small><em>Slamming JD Vance, Tim Walz said, "He is still saying he (Tump) didn't lose the 2020 election".</em></small></p>
</div>

<p>The two candidates, with vastly divergent views on every subject, debated each other on a series of subjects - from inflation to immigration, from taxes to the economy, from abortion to gender issues, the West Asia crisis and even climate change.</p>

<h3><strong>PUNCHES AND COUNTER-PUNCHES</strong></h3>

<p>Picking on each other's presidential candidate and what they considered their vulnerabilities, both Mr Walz and Mr Vance dodged the verbal punches that came their way and responded with equal measure.</p>

<p>Describing Donald Trump as an "unstable" leader who puts the interest of billionaires before commoners, Mr Walz attacked Donald Trump over his policy on immigration. He slammed the former president for "pressuring the Republicans in Congress" to abandon the bipartisan bill on border security.</p>

<p>"Donald Trump had four years to do this. He promised you, Americans, saying how easy it will be."</p>

<p>Mr Vance took a jab at the Democrats over the problem of inflation and economy, and repeatedly questioned Kamala Harris on why she has not done enough to address these important issues in the four years that she was vice-president in the Biden Administration.</p>

<p>"If Kamala Harris has such great plans for how to address middle-class problems, then she ought to do them now - not when asking for promotion, but in the job the American people gave her 3-1/2 years ago," Mr Vance said.</p>

<p>The two also clashed on pressing global issues, especially the crises in Europe and West Asia. Mr Walz called Donald Trump "too fickle" and "sympathetic" to strongmen like Putin and Netanyahu and said that Trump cannot be trusted to handle the conflict-prone region. Mr Vance rejected these claims and asserted that when Mr Trump was President, he had made the world "a more secure place" during his term in office.</p>

<p>Donald Trump, who was watching the debate live, was posting messages - mostly personal attacks - on his website 'Truth Social' in his trademark style. He attacked the moderators of the debate hosted by US television network CBS. He also called the Democratic vice-presidential candidate Tim Walz a man with "low IQ" and even called him "pathetic".</p>

<p>During the debate, Republican candidate JD Vance, who had once been a strong Trump basher, blamed the media for its reporting on Donald Trump, and tried to set the record straight by saying "I was wrong about Donald Trump".</p>

<p>He went on to explain that "I was wrong, first of all, because I believe some of the media stories that turned out to be dishonest fabrications of his record. But most importantly, Donald Trump delivered for the American people."</p>

<h3><strong>THE 'MINNESOTA NICE' DEBATE</strong></h3>

<p>The Vice Presidential debate was between Democratic candidate Tim Walz, 60, a former high school teacher and current Governor of Minnesota with liberal views, and his Republican rival JD Vance, 40, a former venture capitalist, bestselling author and conservative firebrand US senator from Ohio with some very conservative views on issues like abortion.</p>

<p>Though both candidates portrayed themselves as sons of America's Midwestern heartland, each had deeply opposing views on nearly every major issue that is gripping a vastly polarised United States of America.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="By and large both candidates appeared calm and courteous, demonstrating a Minnesota Nice attitude throughout the debate." id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-10/fl9r9nsc_tim-walz-vs-jd-vance-us-vice-presidential-debate-reuters_625x300_03_October_24.jpg" title="By and large both candidates appeared calm and courteous, demonstrating a Minnesota Nice attitude throughout the debate." /></div>

<p class="ins_instory_dv_caption"><small><em>By and large both candidates appeared calm and courteous, demonstrating a 'Minnesota Nice' attitude throughout the debate.</em></small></p>
</div>

<p>While both candidates tried to outperform one-another while dealing the occasional blow to the rival, by and large both men appeared calm and courteous, demonstrating a 'Minnesota Nice' attitude throughout the debate, occasionally even thanking each other.</p>

<p>At the end of the debate, reports and polls suggested that neither candidate dealt a 'knockout punch' to the other, nor could one outshine the other, resulting in a balanced debate with no clear winner.</p>

<p>Political analysts believe that vice presidential debates generally do not alter the outcome of a presidential election. That said, even a slight shift in public opinion could prove decisive with the race on a razor's edge five weeks before election day.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden said on Wednesday that he would not support any Israeli strike on Iran's nuclear sites in response to its missile attack and urged Israel to act "proportionally."</p>

<p>Biden spoke a day after Iran fired more than 180 ballistic missiles at Israel in a move that he previously described as "ineffective." Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed that Iran would pay for the attack.</p>

<p>"We'll be discussing with the Israelis what they're going to do, but all seven of us (G7 nations) agree that they have a right to respond but they should respond proportionally," Biden told reporters before boarding Air Force One.</p>

<p>Some analysts said Israel's response would likely be sharper than when Iran fired missiles and drones at Israel in April, suggesting this time it could target Tehran's nuclear or oil facilities.</p>

<p>Asked whether the U.S. would back any Israeli strike on Iran's nuclear sites, Biden told reporters: "The answer is no."</p>

<p>Biden said more sanctions would be imposed on Iran and that he would speak soon with Netanyahu.</p>

<p>"Obviously, Iran is way off course," he said.</p>

<p>U.S. Deputy Secretary Kurt Campbell said the administration was seeking to align its position with Israel on any response to Iran's attack but also recognizes the Middle East is on a "knife's edge" and a broader escalation could imperil both Israeli and U.S. interests.</p>

<p>Speaking at a virtual event hosted by Washington-based think tank Carnegie Endowment, Campbell repeated the U.S. view that what Tehran has undertaken was "deeply irresponsible" and that there must be a "return message."</p>

<p>"I think we tried to underscore our support for some of the actions that Israel has taken," he added. "We have real wariness about a extended or substantial ground set of operations in Lebanon," Campbell said.</p>

<p>The Israeli army is locked in combat at its northern border with Lebanon's Iran-backed Hezbollah fighters. On Wednesday, eight Israeli soldiers were killed -- the deadliest suffered by Israel's military on the Lebanon front in the past year of border-area clashes between Israel and Hezbollah.</p>

<p>Iran said on Wednesday its missile volley - its biggest ever assault on Israel - was over, barring further provocation.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Russian troops are in complete control of the town of Vuhledar in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region that has resisted Russian assaults for more than two years, the SHOT Telegram channel and pro-Russian war bloggers said on Wednesday.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russian troops are in complete control of the town of Vuhledar in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region that has resisted Russian assaults for more than two years, the SHOT Telegram channel and pro-Russian war bloggers said on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Here are some key points about the town and the battle.</p>

<p><strong>WHAT IS VUHLEDAR?</strong></p>

<p>Vuhledar - which means "gift of coal" - is a coal mining town in eastern Ukraine's Donetsk region with a pre-war population of around 14,000 people, nearly all of whom have fled. It was built by the Soviet Union in the mid 1960s around a mine. There are two mines there now with significant coal reserves. Russians call the town, which sits on a flat plain and is comprised of high-rise apartment buildings and other structures, Ugledar.</p>

<p><strong>WHY DID RUSSIA WANT TO TAKE IT?</strong></p>

<p>Moscow says the Donetsk region is one of four Ukrainian regions it has annexed since 2022, a claim Kyiv rejects as illegal. Moscow saw taking control of Vuhledar as an important stepping stone to incorporating the entire region into Russia.</p>

<p>Control of the town - which Russians long regarded as one of Ukraine's toughest fortified positions to crack - is considered important by both sides because of its position on elevated ground and because it sits at the intersection of the eastern and southern battlefield fronts giving it added significance when it comes to supplying both sides' forces.</p>

<p>While Ukrainian forces were in full control of Vuhledar, they were able to use the town as a platform to shell Russian military supply lines in the area.</p>

<p>The town sits close to a railway line from Crimea, the Black Sea peninsula which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014, to Ukraine's industrialised Donbas region which comprises Donetsk and the eastern region of Luhansk, most of which Moscow controls.</p>

<p>Taking Vuhledar, which Russia portrays as one of the last Ukrainian strongholds in southern Donetsk, opens the way for Russian forces to advance on other places.</p>

<p><strong>HOW DID RUSSIA TAKE CONTROL OF VUHLEDAR?</strong></p>

<p>Russian forces trapped Ukrainian soldiers in the town in what they called a mini-cauldron, gradually encircling it from all sides and thus making it increasingly difficult for Ukrainian forces to resupply or rotate in and out of the town.</p>

<p>When such a cauldron closes, something Russian military bloggers say has already happened, there is no way in or out for the defenders who in this case were bombarded with devastating aerial glide bombs.</p>

<p>Russian forces had previously launched at least four major attempts to take Vuhledar, but had been repelled with Ukraine's 72nd Separate Mechanised Brigade mounting fierce resistance.</p>

<p>Neither side discloses losses, but Ukrainian officials said Russian losses sustained during previous failed attempts to take the town had been significant. Moscow says Ukraine also paid a high human price when trying to retain Vuhledar.</p>

<p><strong>WHAT DOES VUHLEDAR LOOK LIKE NOW</strong></p>

<p>Fierce fighting since 2022 has left much of the town devastated. Images of Russian forces waving their flag on the roof of an administrative building on Tuesday in the centre showed a structure which had been reduced to rubble in parts and whose blackened windows had all been blown out.</p>

<p>Maksym Verbovsky, the town's deputy mayor, told Ukrainian state media last year that every single building had been damaged along with the entire infrastructure. He said then that fewer than 500 civilians, including three children and many pensioners, remained. All children and most adults have since been evacuated.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President Masoud Pezeshkian insisted Wednesday that Iran was "not looking for war" but pledged a stronger response if Israel retaliates for its missile attack.</p>

<p>"If it (Israel) wants to react, we will have a stronger response, this is what the Islamic Republic is committed to," Pezeshkian said in a joint press conference with Qatar's emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani, in Doha.</p>

<p>"We are not looking for war, it is Israel that forces us to react," he said.</p>

<p>Pezeshkian spoke a day after Iran fired about 200 missiles including hypersonic weapons towards Israel, sending frightened civilians into shelters.</p>

<p>Israel intercepted most of them, while medics reported two people lightly wounded by shrapnel. One of the missiles damaged a school building.</p>

<p>On Wednesday the Israeli military said several Iranian missiles fell inside air force bases without causing any damage.</p>

<p>"The dirty goal of the Zionist regime is to cause insecurity and spread crisis in the region," Pezeshkian said.</p>

<p>"What we want from US and European countries is to tell the entity they have planted in the region (Israel) to stop the bloodshed."</p>

<p>Sheikh Tamim warned that Israel was drawing the region to the "brink of the abyss" with its attacks on Hezbollah in Lebanon.</p>

<p>The emir also condemned ongoing Israeli attacks on the Gaza Strip, saying Doha would press on with efforts to broker a ceasefire between Israel and Palestinian group Hamas, whose October 7 attacks triggered the war.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel's pledge to respond to a massive missile strike from Iran has sent diplomats scrambling for ways to avert a full-blown regional war.</p>

<p>AFP spoke with five experts about Iran's calculations, Israel's choices and fears of escalation.</p>

<p><strong>Why did Iran order missile strike?</strong></p>

<p>The Islamic Republic is seen as having suffered a series of Israeli-inflicted humiliations over the last year which have left its strategy of building up allies across the Middle East in tatters.</p>

<p>An Iran-backed alliance known as "the Axis of Resistance" includes the Palestinian group Hamas, Hezbollah in Lebanon, Yemen's Houthi rebels, and other Shiite Muslim armed groups in Iraq and Syria.</p>

<p>Israel has pressed an offensive against Hamas in Gaza since October last year when Hamas launched an unprecedented attack, while the group's political leader Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated in Tehran in July.</p>

<p>In Lebanon, exploding pagers and air strikes have severely weakened Hezbollah, while its leader Hassan Nasrallah was killed by an Israeli missile in a Beirut suburb last week -- along with an Iranian general.</p>

<p>After an Israeli strike on Iran's consulate in the Syrian capital Damascus in April, Tehran retaliated for the first time, firing 300 missiles and drones at the Jewish state, almost all of which were intercepted.</p>

<p>Tuesday's attack saw another 200 missiles fired, again with little military impact, meaning they were largely "symbolic", according to K. Campbell, a US military intelligence veteran with a history of working on Iran.</p>

<p>"All air defense systems have a saturation point, and Iran seems to have purposely stayed below the Israeli air defense saturation point," Campbell told AFP.</p>

<p>"I don't think Iran wants a big regional war," Jon Alterman, a Middle East expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington-based think-tank, said.</p>

<p><strong>How might Israel react?</strong></p>

<p>James Demmin-De Lise, an author and political analyst who has written a book about Israel and anti-Semitism, said he thought Israel would seek to press home its advantage.</p>

<p>"Iran is now thoroughly weakened, as its proxies have been decimated," he said, predicting a "rather dramatic power shift" with Israel possibly even eyeing regime change in Tehran.</p>

<p>A senior European diplomatic source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said there were real fears of an "extension of the conflict."</p>

<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's "team is a bit euphoric, thinking 'we've got Nasrallah, we're going to change the Middle East,'" the source said.</p>

<p>Former Israeli prime minister Naftali Bennett argued on Wednesday for a more targeted military attack on Iran's nuclear facilities.</p>

<p>But Israel is already fighting on two fronts: in Gaza -- where more than 41,000 Palestinians have died, according to the Hamas-run health ministry -- as well as in southern Lebanon where troops began a ground operation to target Hezbollah on Monday.</p>

<p><strong>Would it risk provoking a third war?</strong></p>

<p>"Israel has had a lot of successes in the last two weeks, which they wouldn't want to jeopardize," Alterman from the Center for Strategic and International Studies said.</p>

<p>He said Israel would have to choose between "two instincts of lock in a gain, or double down on a strategy that's been giving results."</p>

<p><strong>What are the 'off-ramps'?</strong></p>

<p>The UN Security Council is set to hold an emergency meeting on Wednesday to discuss the Middle East, but the global body is widely seen as ineffective and divided.</p>

<p>The only foreign power with potential sway over Israel is the United States but President Joe Biden's adminstration has shown itself to have only relative influence.</p>

<p>In a statement the day after the killing of Nasrallah, Biden reiterated US support for "Israel's right to defend itself against Hezbollah, Hamas, the Huthis, and any other Iranian-supported terrorist groups."</p>

<p>But Biden has also been pushing for a ceasefire in Gaza and had declared himself against any Israeli ground offensive in Lebanon -- to no avail.</p>

<p>"President Biden will most likely step in to negotiate but I doubt he will have much influence," said Jordan Barkin, an Israeli political analyst and former magazine editor.</p>

<p>The US also lacks direct relations with Iran, meaning any diplomatic move to defuse tensions would need European or Middle Eastern involvement.</p>

<p>"Everything will depend on the Israeli reaction and everything will depend on the advice and the efforts made by the American administration which has no interest at this time of becoming embroiled in a regional war," said Hasni Abidi, director of the Geneva-based Centre of Study and Research for the Arab and Mediterranean World (CERMAM).</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 13-year-old girl in the US has been accused of stabbing her 7-year-old sister to death following an argument over flushing the toilet. According to <em>The Independent</em>, the incident took place on Saturday in Michigan when the teenager was babysitting her younger sister. Officers responded to the scene at around 1pm to find the victim in the bathroom, suffering from over 10 stab wounds. She was rushed to the hospital where she was pronounced dead, the prosecutor's office said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/crime/teenager-sister-stabbed-flushing-toilet-michigan-b2622082.html"><em>The Independent</em></a><i>,&nbsp;</i>the cops said that a note had been placed in the bathroom about flushing the toilet and a verbal argument broke between the two. During the argument, the 13-year-old allegedly stabbed her younger sister in the abdomen, head and neck with a butcher's knife and a hunting knife, following which she called 911.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The 13-year-old is now facing several charges including first-degree premeditated murder, felony murder and first-degree child abuse, the Prosecutor's Office said. "She was very calm and just showed no emotion," Detective Zachary Digiacomo said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The identities of both the victim and suspect have not been released due to their ages.</p>

<p>The parents told the police that they had only left their older daughter to babysit her younger sister for two hours when the attack unfolded. They insisted that the siblings had only ever had "normal sibling arguments" before.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Separately, one of the family's neighbours spoke out of their shock at what had happened. "Just last night I was talking to her and now she's gone... she used to walk up and down the street everyday riding her bike, walking up and down the street stopping and talking to neighbors.

<p>The outlet reported that the teen will not be tried as an adult, however, she will be kept in the juvenile system. "Given her young age, the state would have seven years to diagnose, treat, and rehabilitate her until her mandatory release at age 21," Prosecutor Kym Worthy said.&nbsp;</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei warned Hezbollah leader Syyed Hassan Nasrallah to flee Lebanon days before he was killed in an Israeli strike, three Iranian sources said.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei warned Hezbollah leader Syyed Hassan Nasrallah to flee Lebanon days before he was killed in an Israeli strike and is now deeply worried about Israeli infiltration of senior government ranks in Tehran, three Iranian sources said.</p>

<p>In the immediate aftermath of the attack on Hezbollah's booby-trapped pagers on Sept. 17, Khamenei sent a message with an envoy to beseech the Hezbollah secretary general to leave for Iran, citing intelligence reports that suggested Israel had operatives within Hezbollah and was planning to kill him, one of the sources, a senior Iranian official, told Reuters.</p>

<p>The messenger, the official said, was a senior Iranian Revolutionary Guards commander, Brigadier General Abbas Nilforoushan, who was with Nasrallah in his bunker when it was hit by Israeli bombs and was also killed.</p>

<p>Khamenei, who has remained in a secure location inside Iran since Saturday, personally ordered a barrage of around 200 missiles to be fired at Israel on Tuesday, a senior Iranian official said. The attack was retaliation for the deaths of Nasrallah and Nilforoushan, the Revolutionary Guards said in a statement.</p>

<p>The statement also cited the July killing of Hamas Leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, and Israel's attacks on Lebanon. Israel has not claimed responsibility for Haniyeh's death.</p>

<p>Israel on Tuesday began what it labelled as a "limited" ground incursion against Hezbollah in southern Lebanon.</p>

<p>Iran's foreign ministry and the office of Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, which oversees the country's foreign intelligence agency Mossad, did not reply to requests for comment.</p>

<p>Nasrallah's assassination followed two weeks of precise Israeli strikes that have destroyed weapons sites, eliminated half of Hezbollah's leadership council and decimated its top military command.</p>

<p>Iran's fears for the safety of Khamenei and the loss of trust, within both Hezbollah and Iran's establishment and between them, emerged in the conversations with 10 sources for this story, who described a situation that could complicate the effective functioning of Iran's Axis of Resistance alliance of anti-Israel irregular armed groups.</p>

<p>Founded with Iran's backing the 1980s, Hezbollah has long been the most formidable member of the alliance.</p>

<p>The disarray is also making it hard for Hezbollah to choose a new leader, fearing the ongoing infiltration will put the successor at risk, four Lebanese sources said.</p>

<p>"Basically, Iran lost the biggest investment it had for the past decades," said Magnus Ranstorp, a Hezbollah expert at the Swedish Defense University, of the deep damage caused to Hezbollah that he said diminished Iran's capacity to strike at Israel's borders.</p>

<p>"It shook Iran to the core. It shows how Iran is deeply infiltrated also: they not only killed Nasrallah, they killed Nilforoushan," he said, who was a trusted military adviser to Khamenei.</p>

<p>Hezbollah's lost military capacity and leadership cadre might push Iran towards the type of attacks against Israeli embassies and personnel abroad that it engaged in more frequently before the rise of its proxy forces, Ranstorp said.</p>

<p><strong>IRAN MAKES ARRESTS</strong></p>

<p>Nasrallah's death has prompted Iranian authorities to thoroughly investigate possible infiltrations within Iran's own ranks, from the powerful Revolutionary Guards to senior security officials, a second senior Iranian official said. They are especially focused on those who travel abroad or have relatives living outside Iran, the first official said.</p>

<p>Tehran grew suspicious of certain members of the Guards who had been traveling to Lebanon, he said. Concerns were raised when one of these individuals began asking about Nasrallah's whereabouts, particularly inquiring about how long he would remain in specific locations, the official added.</p>

<p>The individual has been arrested along with several others, the first official said, after alarm was raised in Iran's intelligence circles. The suspect's family had relocated outside Iran, the official said, without identifying the suspect or his relatives.</p>

<p>The second official said the assassination has spread mistrust between Tehran and Hezbollah, and within Hezbollah.</p>

<p>"The trust that held everything together has disappeared," the official said.</p>

<p>The Supreme Leader "no longer trusts anyone," said a third source who is close to Iran's establishment.</p>

<p>Alarm bells had already rung within Tehran and Hezbollah about possible Mossad infiltrations after the killing in July of Hezbollah commander Fuad Shukr in an Israeli airstrike on a secretive Beirut location while meeting an IRGC commander, two Hezbollah sources and a Lebanese security official told Reuters at the time. That killing was followed a few hours later by the assassination of Hamas leader Haniyeh in Tehran.</p>

<p>Unlike Haniyeh's death, Israel publicly claimed responsibility for the killing of Shukr, a low-profile figure who Nasrallah nonetheless described, at his funeral, as a central figure in Hezbollah's history who had built its most important capabilities.</p>

<p>Shukr was key to the development of Hezbollah's most advanced weaponary, including precision-guided missiles, and was in charge of the Shi'ite groups operations against Israel over the past year, Israel's military has said.</p>

<p>Iranian fears about Israeli penetration of its upper ranks stretches back years. In 2021, former Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said the head of an Iranian intelligence unit that was supposed to target agents of Mossad had himself been an agent for the Israeli spy agency, telling CNN Turk that Israel obtained sensitive documents on Iran's nuclear programme, a reference to a 2018 raid in which Israel obtained a huge trove of top secret documents about the programme.</p>

<p>Also in 2021, Israel's outgoing spy chief Yossi Cohen gave details about the raid, telling the BBC that 20 non-Israeli Mossad agents were involved in stealing the archive from a warehouse.</p>

<p><strong>PAGER WARNING</strong></p>

<p>Khamenei's invitation to Nasrallah to relocate to Iran came after thousands of pagers and walkie talkies used by Hezbollah blew up in deadly attacks on Sept 17 and 18, the first official said. The attacks have been widely attributed to Israel, although it has not officially claimed responsibility.</p>

<p>Nasrallah, however, was confident in his security and trusted his inner circle completely, the official said, despite Tehran's serious concerns about potential infiltrators within Hezbollah's ranks.</p>

<p>Khamenei tried a second time, relaying another message through Nilforoushan to Nasrallah last week, imploring him to leave Lebanon and relocate to Iran as a safer location. But Nasrallah insisted on staying in Lebanon, the official said.</p>

<p>Several high-level meetings were held in Tehran following the pager blasts to discuss Hezbollah and Nasrallah's safety, the official said, but declined to say who attended those meetings.</p>

<p>Simultaneously, in Lebanon, Hezbollah began conducting a major investigation to purge Israeli spies among them, questioning hundreds of members after the pager detonations, three sources in Lebanon told Reuters.</p>

<p>Sheikh Nabil Kaouk, a senior Hezbollah official, was leading the investigation, a Hezbollah source said. The probe was progressing rapidly, the source said, before an Israeli raid killed him a day after Nasrallah's assassination. Another raid earlier last week had targeted other senior Hezbollah commanders, some of who were involved in the inquiry.</p>

<p>Kaouk had summoned for questioning Hezbollah officials involved in logistics and others "who participated, mediated and received offers on pagers and walkie-talkies," the source said.</p>

<p>A "deeper and comprehensive inquiry" and purge were now needed after the killing of Nasrallah and other commanders, the source said.</p>

<p>Ali al-Amin, the editor-in-chief for Janoubia, a news site based that focuses on the Shi'ite community and Hezbollah said reports indicated that Hezbollah detained hundreds of people for questioning after the pagers saga.</p>

<p>Hezbollah is reeling from Nasrallah's killing in his deep bunker in a command HQ, shocked at how successfully Israel penetrated the group, seven sources said.</p>

<p>Mohanad Hage Ali, deputy research director of the Carnegie Middle East Center in Beirut with a focus on Iran and Hezbollah, described the offensive as "the biggest intelligence infiltration by Israel" since Hezbollah was founded with Iran's backing in the 1980s.</p>

<p>The current Israeli escalation follows almost a year of cross-border fighting after Hezbollah began rocket attacks in support of its ally Hamas. The Palestinian group killed 1,200 people and seized 250 hostages in an attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, according to Israeli tallies.</p>

<p>In Gaza, Israel's retaliation has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza health ministry.</p>

<p><strong>LOSS OF TRUST</strong></p>

<p>The Israeli offensive and fear of more attacks on Hezbollah have also prevented the Iranian-backed group from organizing a nationwide funeral on a scale reflecting Nasrallah's religious and leadership status, according to four sources familiar with the debate within Hezbollah.</p>

<p>"No one can authorize a funeral in these circumstances," one Hezbollah source said, lamenting the situation in which officials and religious leaders could not come forward to properly honor the late leader.</p>

<p>Several commanders killed last week were buried discreetly on Monday, with plans for a proper religious ceremony when the conflict ends.</p>

<p>Hezbollah is mulling the option of securing a religious decree to bury Nasrallah temporarily and hold an official funeral when the situation permits, the four Lebanese sources said.</p>

<p>Hezbollah has refrained from officially appointing a successor to Nasrallah, possibly to avoid making his replacement a target for an Israeli assassination, they said.</p>

<p>"Appointing a new Secretary General could be dangerous if Israel assassinates him right after," said Amin. "The group can't risk more chaos by appointing someone only to see them killed."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russian troops on Wednesday took charge of the eastern Ukrainian town of Vuhledar, a bastion that had resisted intense attacks since Russia launched its full-scale assault in 2022.</p>

<p>The advance of Moscow's forces, which control just under a fifth of Ukraine, has underlined Russia's vast superiority in men and materiel as Ukraine pleads for more weapons from the Western allies that have been supporting it.</p>

<p>Ukraine's eastern military command said it had ordered a pullback from the hilltop coal mining town to avoid encirclement by Russian troops and "preserve personnel and military equipment".</p>

<p>The Russian defence ministry did not mention Vuhledar in its daily battlefield report.</p>

<p>Russian Telegram channels, however, published video of troops waving the Russian tricolour flag over shattered buildings.</p>

<p>The town, which had a population of over 14,000 before the war, has been devastated, with Soviet-era apartment buildings smashed apart and scarred.</p>

<p>The Moskovsky Komsomolets newspaper said the last Ukrainian forces from the 72nd Mechanised Brigade, a unit famous for its resistance, had abandoned the town late on Tuesday.</p>

<p>President Vladimir Putin has said Russia's primary tactical goal is to take the whole of the Donbas region - the provinces of Donetsk and Luhansk - in southeastern Ukraine.</p>

<p>Russia controls about 80% of the Donbas, a heavy industry hub where the conflict began in 2014 when Moscow supported pro-Russian separatist forces after a pro-Russian president was toppled in Kyiv and Moscow seized Crimea from Ukraine.</p>

<p><strong>VUHLEDAR TAKEN IN RAPID RUSSIAN ADVANCE</strong></p>

<p>Since Russia sent its army into Ukraine in February 2022, the war has largely been a story of grinding artillery and drone strikes along a heavily fortified 1,000-km (620-mile) front involving hundreds of thousands of soldiers.</p>

<p>But in August the battlefield became much more dynamic: Ukraine smashed through the border in Russia's Kursk region in a bid to divert Russian forces, and Russian troops began advancing faster than before in eastern Ukraine.</p>

<p>Russian forces have been pushing westwards at key points along some 150 km (95 miles) of the front in the Donetsk region, with the logistics hub of Pokrovsk also a key target.</p>

<p>They captured Ukrainsk on Sept. 17 and then began encircling Vuhledar, about 80 km (50 miles) south of Pokrovsk.</p>

<p>Russia has been using pincer tactics to trap and then constrict Ukrainian strongholds. Images from the area showed intense bombardment of the town with artillery and aerial glide bombs.</p>

<p>Neither side discloses losses, and each said the other had paid a high human price for the town.</p>

<p>Control of Vuhledar, which lies at the intersection of the eastern and southern battlefields, is significant because it will ease Russia's advance as it tries to pierce deeper behind the Ukrainian defensive lines.</p>

<p>Russian bloggers said Russia could now try to push towards Velyka Novosilka, just over 30 km (20 miles) to the west.</p>

<p>Vuhledar also sits close to a railway line connecting Crimea to the Donbas region.</p>

<p>Russian forces currently control 98.5% of the Luhansk region and 60% of the Donetsk region.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Rosh Hashanah means 'head of the year'. It is a two-day celebration that marks the beginning of Jewish High Holy Days each autumn.</p>

<p>In a post on X, PM Modi stated, "Spoke to Prime Minister @netanyahu about recent developments in West Asia. Terrorism has no place in our world. It is crucial to prevent regional escalation and ensure the safe release of all hostages. India is committed to supporting efforts for an early restoration of peace and stability."</p>

<p>In October last year, Israel launched a counter-offensive against Hamas after hundreds of Hamas terrorists burst into Israeli borders, killing over 1200 people and taking over 250 hostages, out of which 100 continue to be in captivity.</p>

<p>The turmoil in West Asia escalated after Iran launched nearly 200 ballistic missiles towards targets in Israel on Tuesday and the United States military coordinated closely with the Israeli Defence Forces to help defend Israel against this attack.</p>

<p>US Naval destroyers joined Israeli air defence units in firing interceptors to shoot down inbound missiles. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described Iran's missile attack on his country as a "big mistake" and said Tehran would pay for it."</p>

<p>A day after Iran targeted Israel with a rocket barrage, the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) called on Lebanese civilians in two dozen villages in southern Lebanon to evacuate immediately. The Israeli military said it will update the civilians when they can return.</p>

<p>"Hezbollah's activity forces the IDF to act against it. The IDF does not wish to harm you. For your safety, you must evacuate your homes immediately. Anyone who is near Hezbollah operatives, their facilities or their weapons, puts themselves at risk," Colonel Avichay Adraee, the IDF's Arabic-language spokesman, said in a statement on X.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Iran's attack on Israel wasn't just a barrage of missiles, it was a barrage of 181 ballistic missiles, each having a warhead payload of between 700-1,000 kilograms. It is unprecedented, Israel's Ambassador told NDTV.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iran's attack on Israel wasn't just a barrage of missiles, it was a barrage of 181 ballistic missiles, each having a warhead payload of between 700-1,000 kilograms, which can destroy entire buildings. This is unprecedented in the history of our warfare, Israel Ambassador to India Reuven Azar said today.</p>

<p>Speaking exclusively to NDTV, the Ambassador described Iran's sharp escalation against Israel "a very serious situation", adding that "fortunately we have the best missile defence systems in the world, so most of the missiles were intercepted and no significant damage was done. The only missiles that hit Israel were in open areas that are not usually protected."</p>

<p>He went on to say that "this is not the first time", explaining that Israel has nothing against the Iranian people, but instead against "the radical regime in Iran", which he said has "tried repeatedly to destroy Israel".</p>

<p>"Iran's regime has been financing various terror groups for the last 30 years. They take the money from their own people and fail them by funding extremists. Israel will defend itself and not let this regime succeed," Mr Azar said.</p>

<h2><strong>THE DAMAGE AND THE RETALIATION</strong></h2>

<p>Quoting the IDF or Israel Defence Forces, the Ambassador said that "Fortunately we have not had any loss of life in Israel and not much damage either. But unfortunately, there was a tragic loss of life of a Palestinian national from Gaza where an Iranian missile hit. Iran's missile killed a Palestinian."</p>

<p>Not giving details of a likely counter-attack, Mr Azar said, "We have a challenge here because these kinds of radical people cannot be deterred. We have seen that time and time again. When Hamas launched a terror attack on us or when Nasrallah decided to attack Israel for 11 months, they do not even care for their own people, putting their lives in danger. We have to give a serious blow to these extremists."</p>

<p>The Ambassador further clarified that Israel is not against the people of Iran, and neither are they in the business of installing regimes in other countries. "Israel only defends itself", he said, adding that "We put our lives on the line to defend our country, not to change political realities in other countries."</p>

<p>He however said that "We have seen in the past how Iranian people have revolted against the radical regime. Change will not come from outside, it will come from within, if it does. As for Israel - we are only going to engage to the level of security of our people"</p>

<p>"People of Israel and Iran have shared friendly ties for thousands of years. Iran is not the enemy of Israel. The Persian people have a rich history, an ancient civilisation, which used to have amazing connect with the people of Israel," Mr Azar said.</p>

<p>"We want a situation where our threat to national security is dealt with effectively, a situation where our people can return to their homes in northern Israel, we want a situation where the UN Security Council resolutions 1701 and 1559 can be effectively implemented. Israel does not want to be an occupying force in Lebanon, neither does Israel want to decide on the political future of Lebanon," the envoy said.</p>

<h3><strong>DISAPPOINTMENT WITH UNITED NATIONS SECRETARY GENERAL</strong></h3>

<p>Speaking about the UN chief, the Ambassador said the United Nations are doing very good work, but "unfortunately there are blocs within the United Nations that are biased. It is unfortunate that there is a rigged system in place at the UN, wherein a majority of the countries can manipulate the functioning of the UN such, that you have a Secretary General of the UN who is not condemning this terrible barrage of missiles, it is very very worrisome."</p>

<p>"The UN should be neutral and unbiased," the envoy further said.</p>

<h3><strong>CAN INDIA PLAY A ROLE IN BRINGING PEACE</strong></h3>

<p>When asked if India can play a diplomatic role to bring peace to the region, the Israeli envoy said "That is for India to decide. Diplomacy can always work. We initially tried to resolve issues after the October 7 attack via diplomatic channels, but that didn;t work. Sometimes when there are extremist regimes, in order to defend oneself, one has to deal with it strongly to be effective."</p>

<p>He went on to say that India is an important player and a friend of Israel's, and New Delhi will definitely help in building back the Middle East as a "corridor of stability - one that connects Asia and Europe". India is a partner of Israel, he said.</p>

<h3><strong>TIES WITH THE ARAB NATIONS</strong></h3>

<p>The Israeli envoy highlighted that in the nearly year-long crisis in West Asia, and Israel's efforts to safeguard itself, "not a single Arab country has broken ties with Israel," he said, adding that "In fact, during this year Israel has been building its security cooperation and its intelligence cooperation across the Middle East. What does that show... that when this conflict is over, all these nations which have an interest in building a peaceful and progressive Middle East will work together to achieve that. It shows that there is an alternative to extremism, to fanaticism."</p>

<p>In his closing remarks, the Ambassador made it clear that "Hamas is no longer a threat to Israel, Hezbollah has faced a serious blow, and Iran will now pay for what it has done."<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At least seven people were killed when two gunmen opened fire and stabbed victims at a light rail station in Israel's Jaffa on Tuesday. One of the victims of the attack was a 33-year-old new mother who lost her life while protecting her 9-month-old baby boy Ari.&nbsp;Israeli officials reported that the brave woman shielded her child from harm, giving her life to protect her infant. ''One of the victims from yesterday's terrorist attack in Tel Aviv, Inbar Segev-Vigder, was murdered while shielding her 9-month-old son Ari. She saved his life. There are no words. Only heartbreak. May the memory of the victims be a blessing,'' the State of Israel wrote on X while sharing a picture of the mother-son.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Notably, Segev-Vigder was a 33-year-old fitness and Pilates studio owner from Tel Aviv. Her husband, Yaari Vigder, serves as an Israeli reservist soldier. The couple got married in 2023 and had their first baby in December, last year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Witnesses reported that Segev-Vigder was gunned down while exiting a train in Jaffa.&nbsp;Just hours before the shooting, she posted a prayer on Instagram for the safety of Israeli soldiers entering Lebanon.</p>

<p>"Ari was in a carrier that covered Inbar's entire upper body during the attack, he was not injured at all. For the rest of his life -- may he feel the same love he received from Inbar," <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/article-822974" rel="nofollow, noindex">Jerusalem Post</a></em> cited Yaari Vigder as telling Israel's Channel 11 news.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There were also other victims identified as Revital Bronstein, 24, Shahar Goldman, 30, Nadia Sokolenko, 40, and&nbsp;Ilya Nozadze, 42.&nbsp;Ms Sokolenko, originally from Moldova, was an office manager and a mother to a 6-year-old daughter. Her family awaited her return from grocery shopping but grew concerned when her phone went unanswered, prompting friends to search area hospitals.</p>

<p>The Israeli police said the attackers were residents of the Palestinian city of Hebron in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. The tragedy unfolded mere minutes before Iran launched a massive barrage of ballistic missiles into Israeli territory. The Iranian retaliation was reportedly in response to the killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and several other high-ranking officials of the terror group earlier that week.</p>

<p>Police said the two men who carried out the attack were subsequently shot dead by a civilian armed with a gun and a security guard. The identities of the men have not been confirmed.</p>

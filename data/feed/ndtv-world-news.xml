       <description><![CDATA[The woman, who wishes to remain anonymous, claims that American Airlines bears responsibility for not ensuring her safety and well-being on board.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A New Jersey woman has filed a lawsuit against American Airlines, alleging that the carrier failed to prevent or stop a sexual assault she experienced at the hands of a stranger seated next to her on a flight. According to the <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/american-airlines-assault-flight-new-jersey-b2602014.html" rel="nofollow, noindex">Independent</a></em>, the incident occurred on August 26, 2022, during a nighttime flight from Charlotte, North Carolina, to Newark Liberty International Airport. The woman, who wishes to remain anonymous, claims that American Airlines bears responsibility for not ensuring her safety and well-being on board.</p>

<p>According to the lawsuit, shortly after takeoff, the woman fell asleep, only to awaken to a horrific discovery. She found the stranger's arm inside her pants and his hand forcing hers onto his p***s. The man had covered them both with his black puffer jacket, "digitally penetrating" her while she slept. The woman was left paralysed in shock and panic upon waking.</p>

<p>The stranger then climbed on top of her, ''attempting to penetrate her with his p***s, which he was partially able to do,'' according to the lawsuit. The woman mustered the strength to push him away, and he promptly returned to his seat, ending the assault.</p>

<p>Later, the attacker attempted to downplay the assault by offering the victim water while forcibly holding her hand, only stopping when he noticed a flight attendant approaching. The victim then woke her friend and reported the incident to a flight attendant, who relocated her to a different seat for the remainder of the flight.</p>

<p>Upon landing, the perpetrator was escorted off the plane, and authorities collected statements from the victim and witnesses. But it is ''unknown whether the Perpetrator was taken into custody and/or ever charged with the sexual assault of Plaintiff,'' the lawsuit claimed.</p>

<p>''As alleged in the complaint, we look forward to seeking justice on behalf of our client to remedy this terrible injustice for all that she has suffered,'' the woman's attorney, Brian Andris, told&nbsp;<em>The Independent.</em></p>

<p></p>

<p>In an email, an American Airlines spokesperson said, “We are reviewing the lawsuit and the details of the flight. The safety and comfort of our customers is a top priority for Americans.”</p>

<p>The lawsuit alleged that the airline industry has been aware of the alarming increase in in-flight sexual assaults, with the FBI reporting 96 related cases in the previous year alone. The suit further emphasised that the victim bore no responsibility for the assault and that American Airlines had a clear duty to ensure her safety during the flight.&nbsp;</p>

<p>''American Airlines breached its duty of care by failing to properly monitor the cabin, failing to prevent the sexual assault, and failing to promptly intervene when the assault occurred,'' the lawsuit claims.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="theconversation-article-title">Imagine a group of young men gathered at a picturesque college campus in New England, in the United States, during the northern summer of 1956.</p>

<div class="theconversation-article-body">
<p>It's a small casual gathering. But the men are not here for campfires and nature hikes in the surrounding mountains and woods. Instead, these pioneers are about to embark on an experimental journey that will spark countless debates for decades to come and change not just the course of technology – but the course of humanity.</p>

<p>Welcome to the Dartmouth Conference – the birthplace of artificial intelligence (AI) as we know it today.</p>

<p>What transpired here would ultimately lead to ChatGPT and the many other kinds of AI which now help us diagnose disease, detect fraud, put together playlists and write articles (well, not this one). But it would also create some of the many problems the field is still trying to overcome. Perhaps by looking back, we can find a better way forward.</p>

<h3><strong>The summer that changed everything</strong></h3>

<p>In the mid-1950s, rock'n'roll was taking the world by storm. Elvis's Heartbreak Hotel was topping the charts, and teenagers started embracing James Dean's rebellious legacy.</p>

<p>But in 1956, in a quiet corner of New Hampshire, a different kind of revolution was happening.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1609/aimag.v27i4.1904">Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence</a>, often remembered as the Dartmouth Conference, kicked off on June 18 and lasted for about eight weeks. It was the brainchild of four American computer scientists – John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, Nathaniel Rochester and Claude Shannon – and brought together some of the brightest minds in computer science, mathematics and cognitive psychology at the time.</p>

<p>These scientists, along with some of the 47 people they invited, set out to tackle an ambitious goal: to make intelligent machines.</p>

<p>As <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1609/aimag.v27i4.1904">McCarthy put it in the conference proposal</a>, they aimed to find out “how to make machines use language, form abstractions and concepts, solve kinds of problems now reserved for humans”.</p>

<p><strong>The birth of a field – and a problematic name</strong></p>

<p>The Dartmouth Conference didn't just coin the term “artificial intelligence”; it coalesced an entire field of study. It's like a mythical Big Bang of AI – everything we know about machine learning, neural networks and deep learning now traces its origins back to that summer in New Hampshire.</p>

<p>But the legacy of that summer is complicated.</p>

<p>Artificial intelligence won out as a name over others proposed or in use at the time. Shannon preferred the term “automata studies”, while two other conference participants (and the soon-to-be creators of the first AI program), Allen Newell and Herbert Simon, continued to use “complex information processing” for a few years still.</p>

<p>But here's the thing: having settled on AI, no matter how much we try, today we can't seem to get away from comparing AI to human intelligence.</p>

<p>This comparison is both a blessing and a curse.</p>

<p>On the one hand, it drives us to create AI systems that can match or exceed human performance in specific tasks. We celebrate when AI outperforms humans in games such as chess or Go, or when it can detect cancer in medical images with greater accuracy than human doctors.</p>

<p>On the other hand, this constant comparison leads to misconceptions.</p>

<p>When a <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/computer-beats-go-champion-for-first-time/">computer beats a human at Go</a>, it is easy to jump to the conclusion that machines are now smarter than us in all aspects – or that we are at least well on our way to creating such intelligence. But AlphaGo is no closer to writing poetry than a calculator.</p>

<p>And when a large language model sounds human, <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/google-engineer-claims-ai-chatbot-is-sentient-why-that-matters/">we start wondering if it is sentient</a>.</p>

<p>But ChatGPT is no more alive than a talking ventriloquist's dummy.</p>

<h3><strong>The overconfidence trap</strong></h3>

<p>The scientists at the Dartmouth Conference were incredibly optimistic about the future of AI. They were convinced they could solve the problem of machine intelligence in a single summer.</p>

<p>This overconfidence has been a recurring theme in AI development, and it has led to several cycles of hype and disappointment.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/20124494">Simon stated in 1965</a> that “machines will be capable, within 20 years, of doing any work a man can do”. <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/151188">Minsky predicted in 1967</a> that “within a generation, […] the problem of creating ‘artificial intelligence' will substantially be solved”.</p>

<p>Popular futurist <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/tech/ai-singularity-date-ray-kurzweil-google-b2511847.html">Ray Kurzweil now predicts</a> it's only five years away: “We're not quite there, but we will be there, and by 2029 it will match any person”.</p>

<h3><strong>Reframing our thinking: new lessons from Dartmouth</strong></h3>

<p>So, how can AI researchers, AI users, governments, employers and the broader public move forward in a more balanced way?</p>

<p>A key step is embracing the differences and utility of machine systems. Instead of focusing on the race to “artificial general intelligence”, we can focus on <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0268401224000720">the unique strengths of the systems we have built</a> – for example, the enormous creative capacity of image models.</p>

<p>Shifting the conversation from automation to augmentation is also important. Rather than pitting humans against machines, let's focus on <a href="https://theconversation.com/ai-chatbots-are-coming-to-your-workplace-but-are-not-necessarily-coming-for-your-job-216433">how AI can assist and augment human capabilities</a>.</p>

<p>Let's also emphasise ethical considerations. The Dartmouth participants didn't spend much time discussing the ethical implications of AI. Today, we know better, and must do better.</p>

<p>We must also refocus research directions. Let's emphasise research into AI interpretability and robustness, interdisciplinary AI research and explore new paradigms of intelligence that aren't modelled on human cognition.</p>

<p>Finally, we must manage our expectations about AI. Sure, we can be excited about its potential. But we must also have realistic expectations so that we can avoid the disappointment cycles of the past.</p>

<p>As we look back at that summer camp 68 years ago, we can celebrate the vision and ambition of the Dartmouth Conference participants. Their work laid the foundation for the AI revolution we're experiencing today.</p>

<p>By reframing our approach to AI – emphasising utility, augmentation, ethics and realistic expectations – we can honour the legacy of Dartmouth while charting a more balanced and beneficial course for the future of AI.</p>

<p>After all, real intelligence lies not just in creating smart machines, but in how wisely we choose to use and develop them.<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Billionaire Jared Isaacman is set to embark on his second space trip in three years on Wednesday on the Polaris Dawn mission backed by Elon Musk's SpaceX. Leaving Cape Canaveral in Florida, the 41-year-old is part of a four-person crew attempting to go further from the planet Earth than any space tourist before them in a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule, the <em>New York Post </em>reported. During the course of the five-day journey, he is also poised to become the first private citizen to complete a "spacewalk".&nbsp;</p>

<p>Joining Mr Isaacman on Polaris Dawn will be two SpaceX engineers, Sarah Gillis and Anna Menon, the first from the company to join a mission to orbit. After takeoff today, the four-person team is expected to travel into an oval-shaped orbit that extends as far as 1,400 kilometres from Earth. The space mission will aim to reach the highest orbit around Earth for a crewed mission. Ms Gillis and Ms Menon would also become the first women to make such a journey.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Polaris Dawn space mission is expected to last about five days. Here's everything about the billionaire who is set to become the first private citizen to complete a spacewalk.&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Jared Isaacman is the founder and chief executive officer of Shift4 Payments, a firm that provides payment processing services and point-of-sale software businesses. According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/conormurray/2024/08/26/what-to-know-about-jared-isaacman-billionaire-heading-to-space-tomorrow-for-first-ever-private-spacewalk/" rel="noindex, nofollow"><em>Forbes</em></a>, he is worth about $1.9 billion.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The 41-year-old took up aviation as a hobby, learning how to fly fighter jets and completing a flight around the world in 61 hours, 51 minutes and 15 seconds. According to the outlet, he also co-founded Draken International, which now owns the world's largest private fleet of military jets and trains Air Force pilots. Mr Isaacman sold his majority stake in Draken for a nine-figure sum to Blackstone in 2019, and became a billionaire the following year after he took Shift4 Payments public.</p>

<p>The 41-year-old is now set to take flight in a SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft. The mission will be the first of three planned Polaris missions funded and executed by Mr Isaacman and SpaceX for space technology development purposes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The upcoming mission will be Mr Isaacman's second trip to space. He first travelled to space in 2021 on a self-funded mission launched by SpaceX called Inspiration4.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>About Polaris Dawn space mission&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p>Polaris Dawn space mission stands out not just for its duration but also for its scientific goals and the risks involved. Mr Isaacman and his three crewmates will travel farther from Earth than any space mission conducted since NASA's Apollo flights in the 1970s. According to the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/08/26/us-news/billionaire-jared-isaacman-blasting-off-on-five-day-space-mission/" rel="noindex, nofollow"><em>New York Post</em></a>, the crew will also conduct research on radiation exposure in space, and valuable data for future missions to the moon and Mars.</p>

<p>On the third day of their journey, Mr Isaacman and Ms Gillis will perform space tourism first by opening the hatch of their SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule. Although described as a spacewalk, this involves leaning out of the capsule while tethered, exposing them to the harsh environment of outer space. The two will each spend about 15 minutes outside the spacecraft to test the spacesuits, connected to the ship by 12-foot long umbilical cords that will provide oxygen.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The crew will pass through Earth's Van Allen radiation belts, where dangerous amounts of radiation will be present, and they will conduct an experiment to determine whether the radiation in space can take X-ray images without an X-ray machine, the Forbes reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Notably, the mission is expected to take off from NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida between 3:38 and 7:09 am ET Wednesday - a 24-hour delay from the company's previous launch target.&nbsp;</p>

<p>SpaceX said in a social media post Monday that it pushed the launch time back in order to take "a closer look at a ground-side helium leak" on a piece a equipment designed to detach from the rocket during takeoff.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pop star Taylor Swift has yet to endorse a candidate for president this election season, but some of her fans are entering their political era by organizing for Vice President Kamala Harris.</p>

<p>Senators Elizabeth Warren and Kirsten Gillibrand, both Democrats, joined singer-songwriter Carole King and about 15,000 others on a video conference Tuesday to kickstart Swifties for Kamala's organizing efforts. All of the speakers mentioned their favourite Swift song on the call, including Senator Ed Markey of Massachusetts, who said "Snow on the Beach" was his.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The call on Zoom raked in more than $113,000, organizers said. Swift said in July that 113 was her "favorite number" at an Eras Tour concert in Zurich. Donations continued to roll in after the call concluded.</p>

<p>The Swifties for Kamala call is the latest example of affinity and identity-based groups organizing online for the vice president in what has turned out to be a truncated campaign period after President Joe Biden dropped out of the race late last month.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Harris campaign and allies have embraced virtual gatherings to quickly mobilize volunteers and raise money.</p>

<p>Harris entered August with $377 million cash on hand compared to $327 million for former President Donald Trump, whose fundraising has lagged behind his Democratic opponents - whether Biden or Harris - for most of the campaign.</p>

<p>King serenaded attendees Tuesday with a brief rendition of "Shake it Off," her favorite Swift song, and she offered some tips for how to effectively knock on doors to convince voters to support Harris.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I've been a political activist for years. I've been a volunteer and I've been a door-knocker, even as a famous person," King said.</p>

<p>"You are resilient and you know how to take on bullies," Warren said on the call. "That's what the Harris campaign is all about. Sticking up to bullies like Donald Trump."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Other speakers on Tuesday's call included Representative Chris Deluzio of Pennsylvnia, Representative Becca Balint of Vermont, and North Carolina Democratic Party chair Anderson Clayton.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Swift is not affiliated with the group and she did not attend the call, but the organizers said on social media that she was "always welcome to show up to our party."</p>

<p>Swift's massive following has grown over the past year as she has toured across the country and internationally, playing to sold-out sports stadiums, and as she began a romantic relationship with Kansas City Chiefs football player Travis Kelce.</p>

<p>The Democratic ticket had been eager to secure Swift's backing. Biden's campaign privately hoped for months to land her endorsement before he stood aside and backed Harris for the top of the ticket. Rumours circulated heavily last week that Swift or Beyonce could perform at the Democratic National Convention, though neither ended up making an appearance.</p>

<p>Trump openly sought Swift's support, earlier this year in a post on Truth Social, the social media platform he owns. Earlier this month, he posted an artificial intelligence-created image of her offering her endorsement, which she never gave.</p>

<p>Swift has signalled she may get politically active this cycle. Last September, the tortured poet of the Millennial generation posted a short message on Instagram encouraging her hundreds of millions of followers to register to vote. Afterwards, the website Swift directed her fans to - the nonpartisan nonprofit Vote.org - recorded more than 35,000 voter registrations, according to the organization.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In 2020, Swift endorsed Biden for president.</p>

<p>The Democratic National Convention last week showcased an array of other pop culture icons - including television executive Oprah Winfrey, musician Stevie Wonder, actress Mindy Kaling and singer John Legend.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A video of a Pakistani woman smiling and appearing unremorseful after being involved in a car accident, killing two people, has sparked outrage on social media. On August 19, Natasha Danish, the wife of prominent businessman Danish Iqbal, was driving a Toyota Land Cruiser on Karsaz Road when she attempted to turn.</p>

<p>The next moment, she rammed multiple vehicles, including motorcycles and a parked car, resulting in the deaths of a father and daughter on the spot. At least four others were injured and rushed to nearby hospitals for treatment. One of the victims is now on a ventilator, his family said, as per <a href="https://mmnews.tv/natasha-danish-iqbals-friends-defend-her-after-deadly-karsaz-accident/ ">MM News</a>.</p>

<p>However, Natasha's behaviour after the accident, captured on videos that have since gone viral on social media, was even more shocking. Footage shared on X shows Natasha, surrounded by an angry mob, smiling and boasting about her family's influence. "Tum mere baap ko nahi jantay (you don't know who my father is)," she's heard saying. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Natasha Danish avoided court appearance after the fatal car accident, citing mental health concerns. Her advocate Amir Mansub claimed Natasha's mental health was "not stable", and that she was receiving treatment at Jinnah Hospital. However, hospital records contradicted this claim, showing Natasha was discharged as fit after medical evaluations. Doctors found no need for immediate psychiatric intervention, as per MM News.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The first-class tickets include access to airport lounges, champagne, a large seat and bedding, a chance to "peruse a pillow menu" and other amenities.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a shocking incident, Qantas Airways mistakenly sold hundreds of first-class flight tickets at a huge discount due to a coding error, as per a report in the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/qantas-mistake-fare-first-class-business-tickets-b2602150.html"><em>Independent</em></a>. They are now planning to offer refunds or downgrade the passengers.</p>

<p>On Thursday, the airline posted flights from Australia to the US on its website, however, due to an error, the flights seemed to be up to 85 per cent less expensive than the regular first-class rates. The cost of a return flight was listed at less than $5,000 (Rs 4 lakh), roughly $15,000 (Rs 12 lakh) cheaper than usual. The exceptionally low costs were on offer for around eight hours, during which time over 300 customers were able to reserve the return flights between Australia and the US.</p>

<p>Notably, the first-class tickets include access to airport lounges, champagne, a large seat and bedding, a chance to "peruse a pillow menu" and other amenities.</p>

<p>However, the cheap first-class tickets ended up being a mistake. According to Qantas' terms and conditions on its website, they are entitled to cancel a booking, issue a refund, or issue a new ticket at the proper fare price if mistakes are made and wrong fares are presented that are "reasonably obvious."</p>

<p>Qantas stated that they would still allow passengers to choose a higher class, but not the first-class experience. According to the airline, a business class passenger would still receive a ticket that is 65 per cent less expensive than usual.</p>

<p>A spokesperson for the Australian airline said, "Unfortunately, this is a case where the fare was actually too good to be true." "As a gesture of goodwill, we're rebooking customers in business class at no additional cost. Customers also have the option of a full refund," they added.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The North Atlantic Ocean has been running a fever for months, with surface temperatures <a href="https://climatereanalyzer.org/clim/sst_daily/" style="font-size: 13px;">at or near record highs</a><span style="font-size: 13px;">. But cooling along the equator in both the Atlantic and eastern Pacific may </span><a href="https://coralreefwatch.noaa.gov/product/5km/index_5km_baa-max-ytd.php" style="font-size: 13px;">finally be starting to bring some relief</a><span style="font-size: 13px;">, particularly for vulnerable coral reef ecosystems.</span></p>

<div class="theconversation-article-body">
<p>This cooling comes from two climate phenomena with similar names: La Nina, which forms in the tropical Pacific, and the less well-known Atlantic Nina.</p>

<p>Both can affect the Atlantic hurricane season. While La Nina&nbsp;<a href="https://www.weather.gov/jan/el_nino_and_la_nina">tends to bring conditions ideal for Atlantic hurricanes</a>, the less powerful Atlantic Nina has the potential to reduce some of the hurricane risk.</p>

<p>We're <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6jEKlrQAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">ocean</a> and <a href="https://handlos.eas.gatech.edu/research/">atmospheric scientists</a> who study this type of climate phenomenon. It's rare to see both Ninas at the same time, yet in August 2024, <a href="https://www.climate.gov/news-features/event-tracker/atlantic-nina-verge-developing-heres-why-we-should-pay-attention">both appeared to be developing</a>. Let's take a closer look at what that means.</p>

<h2><strong>La Nina and its cousin, Atlantic Nina</strong></h2>

<p>La Nina is part of the <a href="https://www.climate.gov/enso">El Nino–Southern Oscillation</a>, a well-known climate phenomenon that has widespread effects on climate and weather around the world.</p>

<p>During La Nina, sea surface temperatures in the tropical Pacific dip below normal. Easterly trade winds then strengthen, allowing more cool water to well up along the equator off South America. That cooling <a href="https://theconversation.com/la-nina-is-coming-raising-the-chances-of-a-dangerous-atlantic-hurricane-season-an-atmospheric-scientist-explains-this-climate-phenomenon-228595">affects the atmosphere in ways that reverberate</a> across the planet. Some areas become stormier and others drier during La Nina, and the wind shear that can tear apart Atlantic hurricanes tends to weaken.</p>

<p>La Nina and its warmer opposite, <a href="https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/ninonina.html">El Nino</a>, oscillate <a href="https://www.pmel.noaa.gov/elnino/lanina-faq">every three to four years or so</a>.</p>

<figcaption><span class="caption">La </span>Nina&nbsp;<span class="caption">and its opposite, El Niño, explained. NOAA.</span></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>A similar climate phenomenon, <a href="https://www.aoml.noaa.gov/atlantic-nina-on-the-verge-of-developing-heres-why-we-should-pay-attention/">Atlantic Nina</a>, occurs in the Atlantic Ocean but at a much smaller scale and amplitude. It typically peaks around July or August and tends to have a shorter duration than its Pacific cousin and much more modest and local impacts. Atlantic Ninas generally have the <a href="https://cpaess.ucar.edu/sites/default/files/meetings/2020/presentations/kim-presentation.pdf">opposite effect</a> of <a href="https://www.climate.gov/news-features/event-tracker/atlantic-nina-verge-developing-heres-why-we-should-pay-attention">Atlantic Ninos, which tend to</a> reduce <a href="https://www.aoml.noaa.gov/the-atlantic-nino-el-ninos-little-brother/">rainfall over Africa's Sahel</a> region and increase rainfall in Brazil and the countries that surround the Gulf of Guinea, such as Ghana, Nigeria, and Cameroon.</p>

<p>While much weaker than their Pacific counterpart, Atlantic Ninas can, however, partially counteract La Ninas by weakening summer winds that help drive the upwelling that cools the eastern Pacific.</p>

<h2><strong>Why are both happening now?</strong></h2>

<p>In July and August 2024, meteorologists <a href="https://www.aoml.noaa.gov/atlantic-nina-on-the-verge-of-developing-heres-why-we-should-pay-attention/">noted cooling</a> that appeared to be the development of an Atlantic Nina along the equator. The winds at the ocean surface had been weak through most of the summer, and sea surface temperatures there were <a href="https://coralreefwatch.noaa.gov/product/5km/index_5km_ssta.php">quite warm until early June</a>, so signs of an Atlantic Nina emerging were a surprise.</p>

<p>At the same time, waters along the equator in the eastern Pacific were also cooling, with <a href="https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/analysis_monitoring/enso_advisory/ensodisc.shtml">La Nina&nbsp;conditions expected</a> there by October or November.</p>

<figcaption><span class="caption">A map of sea surface temperature anomalies shows cooling along the tropical Atlantic and eastern Pacific regions, but much warmer than average temperatures in the Caribbean.</span></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Getting a Pacific-Atlantic Nina combination is <a href="https://www.climate.gov/news-features/event-tracker/atlantic-nina-verge-developing-heres-why-we-should-pay-attention">rare but not impossible</a>. It's like finding two different pendulums that are weakly coupled to swing in opposite directions moving together in time. The combinations of La Nina and Atlantic Niño, or El Niño and Atlantic Nina are more common.</p>

<h2><strong>Good news or bad for hurricane season?</strong></h2>

<p>An Atlantic Nina may initially suggest good news for those living in hurricane-prone areas.</p>

<p>Cooler than average waters off the coast of Africa can suppress the formation of African easterly waves. These are <a href="https://glossarytest.ametsoc.net/wiki/African_Easterly_Wave">clusters of thunderstorm activity</a> that can form into tropical disturbances and eventually tropical storms or hurricanes.</p>

<p>Tropical storms <a href="https://oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/facts/hurricanes.html">draw energy from the process of evaporating water</a> associated with warm sea surface temperatures. So, cooling in the tropical Atlantic could weaken this process. That would leave less energy for the thunderstorms, which would reduce the probability of a tropical cyclone forming.</p>

<p>However, NOAA takes all factors into account when <a href="https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/outlooks/hurricane.shtml">it updates its Atlantic hurricane season outlook</a>, released in early August, and it still anticipates an extremely active 2024 season. <a href="https://climatecenter.fsu.edu/topics/hurricanes">Tropical storm season typically peaks</a> in early to mid-September.</p>

<p><iframe class="tc-infographic-datawrapper" frameborder="0" height="400px" id="lcaEc" scrolling="no" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/lcaEc/2/" style="border: 0;" width="100%"></iframe></p>

<p>Two reasons are behind the busy forecast: The <a href="https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/outlooks/Slide4.JPG">near record-breaking warm</a> sea surface temperatures in much of the North Atlantic can strengthen hurricanes. And the expected development of a La Nina in the Pacific tends to weaken <a href="https://theconversation.com/what-is-wind-shear-an-atmospheric-scientist-explains-how-it-can-disrupt-air-travel-and-tear-apart-hurricanes-213527">wind shear</a> – the change in wind speed with height that can tear apart hurricanes. La Nina's much stronger effects can override any impacts associated with the Atlantic Nina.</p>

<h2><strong>Exacerbating the problem: Global warming</strong></h2>

<p>The past two years have seen <a href="https://climatereanalyzer.org/clim/sst_daily/">exceptionally high ocean temperatures</a> in the Atlantic and around much of the world's oceans. The two Ninas are likely to contribute some cooling relief for certain regions, but it may not last long.</p>

<p>In addition to these cycles, the global warming trend caused by rising greenhouse gas emissions is raising the baseline temperatures and can <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/earth/climate-change/a-force-of-nature-hurricanes-in-a-changing-climate/">fuel major hurricanes</a>.<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>More than 24,000 members of the Indian diaspora have signed up to attend a mega community event that will be addressed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi here next month.</p>

<p>The ‘Modi &amp; US' Progress Together' event will be held on September 22 at the Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum, which has a capacity of 15,000.</p>

<p>The Indo-American Community of USA (IACU) said Tuesday that over 24,000 Indian-Americans have signed up to attend the mega event, a community gathering that will be addressed by Modi.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Modi is scheduled to address the high-level UN General Assembly session here on September 26, according to a provisional list of speakers issued by the UN.</p>

<p>The IACU said in a statement that registrations for the event in Uniondale, Long Island have come through 590 community organisations, all of whom have signed up as ‘Welcome Partners', from across the United States.</p>

<p>While Indian Americans from at least 42 states are expected to attend, the response has been particularly strong from the tri-state area, it said.</p>

<p>"We're committed to ensuring as many people as possible can participate in this historic event," said a key organiser of the event.</p>

<p>"We're going to do our best to expand seating arrangements and coordinate with our Welcome Partners to prioritise final seat allocations to those who will confirm they expect to attend." The IACU said the 'Modi &amp; US' event “promises to be a significant gathering celebrating the interconnected diversity of the Indian-American community.” Attendees and participating organisations will include a wide range of religious communities, including members of the Jewish, Zoroastrian, Jain, Christian, Sikh, Muslim, and Hindu communities. They also represent a significant cross-section of India's diverse languages, including Hindi, Telugu, Punjabi, Tamil, Bengali, Malayalam, Gujarati, and others, IACU said.</p>

<p>In addition to an address by Prime Minister Modi, the event will showcase cultural performances and appearances by prominent Indian-Americans in business, science, entertainment, and the arts.</p>

<p>A not-for-profit organisation, the Indo-American Community of USA (IACU) fosters understanding of and unity within the Indo-American community through cultural events and public programmes.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, sources told PTI that preparations are in full swing for the community event in Long Island, coming 10 years after Modi addressed a massive community gathering at the famed Madison Square Garden in New York in September 2014 just months after he had first taken charge as Prime Minister and visited the city to attend the high-level annual General Assembly session.</p>

<p>In 2019, Modi addressed the mega community event ‘Howdy Modi' at the NRG Stadium in Houston, Texas, where he was joined by former President Donald Trump. This year's visit to the US comes just weeks before the country goes to the presidential polls in November with a race to the top office between Trump and Democratic Presidential nominee Kamala Harris, the first woman of Black and Indian heritage.</p>

<p>This year, the high-level General Debate of the 79th session of the UN General Assembly will take place from September 24-30. As per the provisional list of speakers for the General Debate issued by the UN on Monday, India's “Head of Government” is scheduled to address the high-level session in the afternoon of September 26.</p>

<p>The list is not final and the UN releases updated provisional lists of speakers in the weeks leading up to the high-level session to reflect any modifications in attendance, schedules and speaking slots of leaders, ministers and ambassadors.</p>

<p>Modi took oath in June as India's Prime Minister for a historic third term and last addressed the annual high-level UNGA session in September 2021.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Modi also visited the UN headquarters on June 21 last year, leading the historic Yoga Day commemoration at the North Lawn of the world body's headquarters before heading to Washington DC for a State Visit hosted by former President Joe Biden.</p>

<p>UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres will present his report before the start of the General Debate, followed by an address by the President of the 79th session of the General Assembly.</p>

<p>Guterres is also convening the ambitious Summit of the Future at UN Headquarters during the high-level week, with the action days slated for September 20-21 and the Summit scheduled on September 22-23.</p>

<p>World leaders will convene at the United Nations to adopt the Pact for the Future, which will include a Global Digital Compact and a Declaration on Future Generations as annexes.</p>

<p>“The Summit is a high-level event, bringing world leaders together to forge a new international consensus on how we deliver a better present and safeguard the future,” the UN has said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the cage holding an endangered Formosan black bear swung open conservationists blasted gunshots and air horns to ensure the frightened young bear disappeared quickly into the mountains of central Taiwan, hopefully far from human contact.</p>

<p>Ziman, a one-and-a-half-year-old bear, had finally recovered from the amputation of a paw caused by a hunter's steel noose and now had a second chance in life.</p>

<p>"Please take care of him and help him find his parents safely," Pihao Payen, the leader of a nearby ethnic Atayal community, said in a prayer as Ziman disappeared from sight.</p>

<p>Wearing a traditional tribal tunic and headgear decorated with animal horns, the 74-year-old chief and an experienced hunter also prayed for his ancestors' help to keep Ziman away from traps.</p>

<p>Taiwanese hunters and conservationists are teaming up to protect the Formosan black bear, with only a few hundred estimated still in the wild, by designing new traps which will not amputate limbs if they are accidentally caught in a snare.</p>

<p>While bears are not a target for Indigenous Taiwanese hunters, people in Pihao Payen's village accidentally caught bears twice in recent years when laying traps for prey such as deer and boars, a traditional practice in Indigenous culture.</p>

<p>Since 2014, 18 bears have been captured in traps, with six found dead, according to the non-governmental organisation, the Taiwan Black Bear Conservation Association.</p>

<p>While most of the bears were released, some suffered major injuries caused by old-fashioned hunting tools such as metal snares, which can break bones or sever paws or toes as the bear struggles to break free.</p>

<p>"Steel snares bounce off from the ground and tighten up their limbs when triggered by animals," said Liu Li-wen, an animal caretaker who oversaw Ziman's recovery in a government-run bear shelter in the mountains of Taichung.</p>

<p>"The snares turned tighter and tighter as the animal struggled. When blood circulation stopped, his entire paw turned necrotic," she said, showing pictures of Ziman's swollen left paw. Vets had to cut most of the paw off to save the cub's life after two months of treatment.</p>

<p>"That's why we are seeing many bears with broken paws or toes in the wild. It's likely that they were entangled by traps, broke free by themselves and survived," she said.</p>

<h3><strong>NEW SNARES</strong></h3>

<p>The Formosan black bear is one of seven subspecies of Asiatic black bear which is considered vulnerable to extinction by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.</p>

<p>Indigenous to sub-tropical Taiwan with an iconic V-shaped white mark on the chest, the Formosan black bear is seen as a symbol of Taiwanese identity that champions its diverse culture and freedom. Democratic Taiwan was previously better known internationally as Formosa.</p>

<p>To reduce death or injuries of wildlife, the Forestry and Nature Conservation Agency is now urging hunters and farmers to adopt a new type of animal snare designed to only trap smaller prey and which does not tighten to the point of amputation.</p>

<p>More than 5,600 such traps have been given to hunters and farmers for free across mountainous Taiwan which is 60% covered by forest, while monetary rewards are given to those who report cases of bears caught by traps.</p>

<p>"Because of its small size, and because the bear's palm is very wide, you see that it (the bear paw) will not fall in completely when stepped on like this," explained Pan Wen-ming, an ethnic Amis hunter and guava farmer in central Taiwan, as he demonstrated how to set up the new trap to Reuters reporters.</p>

<p>"It tries to minimise (bear injuries) while letting the elders and hunters of our tribe still hunt for prey," he said.</p>

<p>Chen Yen-long, chief of the Wushikeng Research Centre bear shelter in Taichung, said some hunters killed snared bears for fear of being prosecuted for trapping a protected animal.</p>

<p>Sadly, Ziman, the cub with the amputated paw, was found dead in the central mountains only weeks after his release, with authorities unable to determine the cause of death.</p>

<p>"This is not the end of the story. We will not stop what we are doing," said Lai Chiao Ling, one of Ziman's caretakers. "At least there are still bears in the wild for us to save."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Poland and Ukraine is being construed by pro-West lobbies in India as a new thrust of Indian foreign policy towards Central and East Europe, to re-balance and de-hyphenate its engagement with Russia and Central Europe, and more particularly, its ties with Russia and Ukraine.</p>

<p>The view of this lobby is that India, in defence of its Russia sensitivities, did not engage Ukraine and the erstwhile Warsaw Pact countries so far. Modi's visit to Ukraine is therefore seen in these pro-Western circles as a long overdue correction of India's approach to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.</p>

<p>India, it is argued, has all along stayed silent on Russia's unacceptable actions even when they challenged the core principles of India's worldview - the sanctity of national sovereignty and territorial integrity. The political costs of this silence on Russian aggressions have been mounting and ergo the change in India's approach that we see.</p>

<h2><strong>A Shallow Analysis</strong></h2>

<p>This kind of analysis of India's foreign policy is ill-informed, shallow and ideological. Take the Czech Republic as an example of India's supposed lack of engagement with Central and East Europe. Look at the reality: India's former President, Ram Nath Kovind, made a visit there in 2018; the Czech PM visited India in 2019, when the Czech Republic was a partner country at the Vibrant Gujarat Summit; its Defence Minister came in February 2019, its Foreign Minister in January 2020; former CDS General Rawat visited the Czech Republic in November 2021; India's External Affairs Minister (EAM) went there in June 2022; the Czech Foreign Minister came to India in February 2023; the Czech Prime Minister came to India in January 2024 when the India-Czechia Strategic Partnership On Innovation was adopted. The Czech Foreign Minister visited India again in February 2024. Similarly, Prime Minister Orban of Hungary visited India in 2013, the Hungarian Foreign Minister has visited India three times - in 2020, 2022 and 2024 - while India's EAM visited Hungary in 2019. High-level visits have been exchanged with Slovakia too, as well as Poland.</p>

<p>The Russia-Ukraine conflict has posed serious problems for not only India but the international community as a whole. The US, Europe and the G7 are pitted against Russia. China, which has intensive ties with the West, is supporting Russia, bearing in mind that Beijing is now seen by the US as its biggest adversary. It therefore sees the value of Russia as a partner. India has deepening ties with the West but also has close historical ties with Russia. India is not in a position to either alienate the West or Russia, as it needs both to protect and advance its larger national interest.</p>

<h2><strong>The Russia-Ukraine Issue Is Multilayered</strong></h2>

<p>If Russia has committed aggression against Ukraine, the list of aggressions that the US and its partners in NATO have committed against other countries is incomparably longer. If this has not deterred India from forging close ties with the US and NATO countries, why would it be wrong to preserve our ties with Russia? Should we have double standards too?</p>

<p>More pertinently, an objective analysis of the Ukraine conflict would show that the responsibility for it does not lie on one side only. It is not a simple case of violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of one country. Much larger and complex issues of historical legacies, geopolitics, national security, balance of power, ethnic rights, external interference, regime change, etc., are involved.</p>

<p>India cannot take a simplistic view of the conflict. More so as those who want to promote the interests of the West should recall that on issues of our own sovereignty and territorial integrity, the record of the West has been adverse to our interests, and is not supportive even now.</p>

<h2><strong>Multilateralism Has Collapsed</strong></h2>

<p>Modi's visit to Ukraine should not be seen as India de-hyphenating its engagement with Russia and Ukraine. India, as well as the global south in general, has been impacted by the Russia-Ukraine conflict in many ways. Europe, too, has been hit by this conflict, which is also against our interest at a time when we seek to deepen our ties with Europe, especially on the trade and technology front, not to mention the larger issues of energy security, climate change, critical technologies, etc., which require constructive cooperation with Europe.</p>

<p>The complete breakdown of a dialogue between the US and Russia is against our interests too. The liberal use of sanctions as a political and economic tool disrupts our ties with Russia as well as with others, like Iran. Multilateralism has virtually collapsed. This prevents much-needed international cooperation to address problems that are global in nature. Viewing Modi's visit to Ukraine only in the context of balancing our ties with Russia is missing the larger point.</p>

<p>All the more so as Russia had been taken into confidence about the visit and no doubt felt assured that India would do nothing to harm its interests. Russia has never counselled us not to engage Ukraine, or, for that matter, forge closer relations with the US, including defence ties, an area of prime interest for Moscow in ties with India. The US, on the contrary, openly asks us to dilute ties with Russia, especially in the defence area.</p>

<h2><strong>A Range Of Reasons</strong></h2>

<p>The reasons for Modi visiting Ukraine are diverse. They flow from a developing willingness to play whatever role is feasible in resolving the conflict peacefully. Modi has been saying in many fora that India is willing to be helpful. India's rising stature under Modi's leadership, the success of India's G-20 presidency, the Indian discourse that we seek friendship with all, that we are in a position to talk to countries that may be adversaries of each other, the belief promoted by our Western interlocutors that Modi, after his homily to Putin that "today is not an era of war", could talk peace to the Russian persuasively, may explain why Modi may have felt it was time to carry his message of dialogue and diplomacy to Kyiv.</p>

<p>Beyond this, Modi may have wanted to defuse rising criticism in the US and Ukraine after his visit to Moscow where he embraced Putin in his signature greeting style that Putin too has adopted, by making a balancing visit to Kyiv. During the visit, he consciously embraced Zelenskyy on three occasions, put his arm around his shoulders and held his hand in a gesture of personal empathy and fellow-feeling. The Ukrainian side, keeping in mind that while in Moscow Modi had expressed great anguish to Putin at the killing of children in war, organised a visit to the exhibition in Kyiv on children killed in the ongoing conflict to expose Modi to Russian brutalities. The Ukrainian side had also wanted Modi to visit the hospital allegedly bombed by Russia, but the Indian side would have resisted being drawn into too many anti-Russia elements in the programme.</p>

<h2><strong>India's Position Is Clear</strong></h2>

<p>On substance, India yielded nothing during the visit on the fundamentals of its position on the conflict. India did not endorse Zelenskyy's 10-point peace plan that the Ukrainian president lobbied for. EAM Jaishankar declared in his press briefing that there were multiple ways of approaching the issue of peace talks. India's position is clearly reflected in the joint statement, to the effect that all stakeholders should be engaged to develop innovative solutions that should have broad acceptability. Jaishankar made it a point to draw attention to this para in the joint statement in his press briefing.</p>

<p>It is noteworthy that in the joint statement with Poland and Ukraine, the paragraphs on the Ukraine issue make no mention of Russia by name, just as in the case of the G-20 Delhi Declaration. But there, neither Ukraine nor Poland were present. This was a notable success of Indian diplomacy.<br />
India preserved its equities with Russia while engaging Zelenskyy in Ukraine.</p>

<p>Perhaps the failure to draw India to his side and drive some wedge between India and Russia would explain Zelenskyy's remarks to the Indian press in Kyiv that conveyed his differences with India on substance and altogether lacked diplomatic propriety.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pavel Durov, the founder and chief of Telegram, is set to learn Wednesday whether he will face charges and even be remanded in custody after his weekend arrest by French authorities over alleged violations at the messaging app.</p>

<p>Durov, 39, was arrested at Le Bourget airport outside Paris late Saturday, and while the judicial authorities have repeatedly extended his initial period of detention, it can last a maximum of 96 hours.</p>

<p>As part of a probe that was confidentially opened on July 8, Durov is being investigated on suspicion of 12 offences related to failing to curb extremist content on Telegram, sources close to the investigation have said.</p>

<p>The tech mogul founded Telegram as he was in the process of quitting his native Russia a decade ago. Its growth has been exponential, with the app now boasting over 900 million users.</p>

<p>An enigmatic figure who rarely speaks in public, Durov is a citizen of Russia, France and the United Arab Emirates, where Telegram is based.</p>

<p>Forbes magazine estimates his current fortune at $15.5 billion, though he proudly promotes the virtues of an ascetic life that includes ice baths and not drinking alcohol or coffee.</p>

<p>Numerous questions have been raised about the timing and circumstances of Durov's detention, in particular why he flew into Paris apparently knowing a warrant had been issued against him.</p>

<h3><strong>'In no way political'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>In a post on X to address what he called "false information" concerning the case, French President Emmanuel Macron said Durov's arrest "took place as part of an ongoing judicial investigation".&nbsp;</p>

<p>"It is in no way a political decision. It is up to the judges to rule on the matter," he wrote in a highly unusual comment on a legal case.</p>

<p>In Moscow, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the charges were very serious and thus needed "no less serious evidence".</p>

<p>"Otherwise this would be a direct attempt to restrict freedom of communication, and, I might even say, directly intimidate the head of a large company," he said.</p>

<p>The UAE meanwhile said it was "closely following the case" and had requested consular access for its citizen.</p>

<p>Among those voicing support for Durov is fellow tech tycoon and chief executive of X, Elon Musk, who has posted comments under the hashtag #FreePavel.</p>

<p><strong>'Nothing to hide'&nbsp;</strong><br />
When the initial 96-hour questioning period ends, the investigating magistrate can either free Durov or press charges and remand him in custody.</p>

<p>He could also be freed under judicial control which could include restrictions on his movements.</p>

<p>Durov, who has been based in Dubai in recent years, arrived in Paris from the Azerbaijani capital Baku and was planning to have dinner in the French capital, a source close to the case said.</p>

<p>He was accompanied by a bodyguard and a personal assistant who always travel with him, added the source, asking not to be named.</p>

<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin was in Baku on a state visit to Azerbaijan on August 18 and 19, though Peskov has denied that the two met.</p>

<p>France's OFMIN, an office tasked with preventing violence against minors, issued an arrest warrant for Durov in a preliminary investigation into alleged offences including fraud, drug trafficking, cyberbullying, organised crime and promotion of terrorism.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Telegram said in response that "Durov has nothing to hide and travels frequently in Europe".</p>

<p>"Telegram abides by EU laws, including the Digital Services Act -- its moderation is within industry standards," it added.</p>

<p>"It is absurd to claim that a platform or its owner is responsible for the abuse of that platform."</p>

<p>Telegram has positioned itself as a "neutral" alternative to US-owned platforms, which have been criticised for their commercial exploitation of users' personal data.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It has also played a key role since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, used actively by politicians and commentators on both sides of the war.</p>

<p>But critics accuse it of often hosting illegal content ranging from extreme sexual imagery to disinformation and narcotics services.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prosecutors on Tuesday filed a revised indictment of Donald Trump, pressing ahead with bombshell charges that he tried to overturn the 2020 US election after losing to Joe Biden.</p>

<p>The superseding indictment retains the same four charges against Trump as in an earlier version but takes into account a recent Supreme Court ruling that a former president has broad immunity from criminal prosecution.</p>

<p>The new indictment of the 78-year-old Republican White House candidate is 36 pages long, down from 45 pages previously, and removes material affected by the immunity ruling from the conservative-dominated top court.</p>

<p>It retains the same core, stating that Trump lost in 2020 but "was determined to remain in power" and attempted to subvert the results.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court ruled in July that an ex-president has broad immunity from prosecution for official acts conducted while in office, but can be pursued for unofficial acts.</p>

<p>This threw into doubt the historic prosecution of the ex-president.</p>

<p>Trump referred to the new indictment as an "act of desperation" that was part of a "witch hunt" against him.</p>

<p>"The illegally appointed 'Special Counsel' Deranged Jack Smith, has brought a ridiculous new Indictment against me, which has all the problems of the old Indictment, and should be dismissed IMMEDIATELY," he posted on his Truth Social platform.</p>

<p>The new indictment comes three days before Special Counsel Jack Smith, who brought the charges against Trump, and lawyers for the former president had been set to file a schedule for pre-trial proceedings.</p>

<p>Judge Tanya Chutkan, who is presiding over the case, had also scheduled a status hearing for September 5 in Washington and it was not immediately clear if that would go ahead now, following the filing of the superseding indictment.</p>

<p>Trump's lawyers have been seeking to delay a trial until after November's election between Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential candidate.</p>

<p>Trump is accused of conspiracy to defraud the United States and conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding -- the January 6, 2021 joint session of Congress that was attacked by Trump supporters.</p>

<p>Trump is also accused of seeking to disenfranchise US voters with his campaign of false claims that he won the 2020 election.</p>

<p>He was originally scheduled to go on trial on March 4, but that was put on hold while his lawyers pushed his claim of presidential immunity all the way up to the Supreme Court.</p>

<h3><strong>'Private capacity'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>It will be up to Chutkan, an appointee of former Democratic president Barack Obama, to decide which of Trump's actions regarding the 2020 election were official acts and which were unofficial acts subject to potential prosecution.</p>

<p>That and other pre-trial issues are expected to take months, making it unlikely the case will go to trial before the November 5 presidential vote.</p>

<p>The new indictment drops references to Jeffrey Clark, a former senior Justice Department official who was one of six co-conspirators listed in the original indictment allegedly enlisted by Trump to press his false claims of election fraud.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court, in its immunity ruling, said a president's communications with members of the Justice Department should be considered official acts.</p>

<p>The remaining co-conspirators, who include Trump's former personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, "were acting in a private capacity," the indictment said, "to assist him in his criminal efforts to overturn the legitimate results of the 2020 presidential election and retain power."</p>

<p>Regarding the ruling on Trump's immunity, Supreme Court Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson said that she was "concerned" about the July verdict, according to an interview released by CBS News on Tuesday.</p>

<p>"I was concerned about a system that appeared to provide immunity for one individual under one set of circumstances when we have a criminal justice system that had ordinarily treated everyone the same," she said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Jackson was among three justices who dissented from the court's ruling.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Trump was convicted in New York in May of 34 counts of falsifying business records to cover up hush money payments made to porn star Stormy Daniels.</p>

<p>Sentencing has been scheduled for September 18, but Trump's lawyers have asked for his conviction to be tossed, citing the Supreme Court immunity ruling, and sentencing to be delayed.</p>

<p>Trump also faces charges in Georgia related to efforts to overturn the 2020 election.</p>

<p>Trump was also charged in Florida with mishandling top-secret documents after leaving the White House.</p>

<p>The judge presiding over the documents case, Aileen Cannon, a Trump appointee, dismissed the charges on the grounds that Smith, the special counsel, was unlawfully appointed.</p>

<p>Smith has appealed Cannon's ruling.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[27-year-old Indian was among two telecommunications professionals who recently died in the harsh Rub' al Khali desert in Saudi Arabia.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>27-year-old Indian was among two telecommunications professionals who recently <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/indians-abroad/telangana-man-colleague-die-in-saudi-arabia-desert-after-losing-gps-signal-6412473">died in the harsh Rub' al Khali desert</a> in Saudi Arabia. Mohammad Shehzad Khan, from Telangana, and his Sudanese colleague were on a mission to repair a cellular tower when they got stranded there following a series of unfortunate events.</p>

<p>Their GPS signal failed, their mobile phones had no battery, and their vehicle ran out of fuel, leaving them exposed to the scorching desert conditions. The incident occurred between August 19 and August 21, and despite efforts to survive, the duo succumbed to dehydration. Their bodies are being repatriated to their respective countries.</p>

<p><strong>Rub' al-Khali Desert</strong></p>

<p>The Rub' al-Khali desert, also known as the Empty Quarter, is the world's most dangerous desert, spanning 650 square km across Saudi Arabia, Oman, Yemen, and the UAE. It is a vast expanse of nothingness, with extreme heat, navigation difficulties, and scarce food and water.</p>

<p>The desert is known for its isolated dunes, horned vipers, burrowing snakes, and boas. The notorious sabkhas, or salt flats, pose a massive challenge for drivers, and the absence of internet and help at hand makes it even more daunting. The Rub' al-Khali desert is unforgiving, with temperatures soaring to extreme highs and lows. The lack of landmarks, combined with the harsh weather conditions, makes it a treacherous terrain for travellers.</p>

<p><strong><em>'Arabian Sands' </em>by Wilfred Thesiger</strong></p>

<p>Despite the risks, adventurers and travellers continue to be drawn to the desert. Wilfred Thesiger, a British explorer, crossed the desert in the 1940s, and his book,<em> Arabian Sands</em>, chronicles his journey.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"To return to the Empty Quarter would be to answer a challenge, and to remain there for long would be to test myself to the limit. Much of it was unexplored. It was one of the very few places left where I could satisfy an urge to go where others had not been... The Empty Quarter offered me the chances to win distinction as a traveller," read an excerpt from the book by Wilfred Thesiger. "For this was the real desert where differences of race and colour, of wealth and social standing, are almost meaningless; where coverings of pretence are stripped away and basic truths emerge."</p>

<p>Mr Thesiger's approach to exploration was distinct, as he embraced physical challenges and chose to travel in a way that was unconventional for his time. He walked barefoot in the desert, preferred camels to cars, and spent extended periods with the Bedouin people, despite his privileged upbringing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I pondered on this desert hospitality and compared it with our own. I remembered other encampments where I had slept, small tents on which I had happened in the Syrian desert and where I had spent the night. Gaunt men in rags and hungry-looking children had greeted me, and bade me welcome with the sonorous phrases of the desert," he wrote in <em>Arabian Sands</em>. "In the desert, I had found a freedom unattainable in civilization; a life unhampered by possessions, since everything that was not a necessity was an encumbrance."</p>

<p>Before his journey, only two people had successfully crossed the Empty Quarter: Bertram Thomas in 1931 and Harry St John Philby in 1932.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>'Sabkhas' or salt flats</strong></p>

<p>The Empty Quarter is characterised by its sabkhas, or salt flats, which form when landlocked seas evaporate, leaving behind salt deposits. These salt flats, situated between dunes, pose a significant challenge for drivers due to their soft and expansive nature. Razia Ali, a geophysicist and maths teacher who travelled through the Empty Quarter in February 2023, described her experience with sabkhas as "daunting" and noted the risk of cars becoming stuck in the soft sand.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ms Ali also highlighted the challenges faced by modern-day travellers. In a post on&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/@RaaziaAli/rub-al-khali-where-man-and-nature-are-forced-to-ponder-767cf216b6f9 ">Medium</a>, she described the lack of internet as "like cutting the umbilical cord and leaving you without food and oxygen." She pointed out how deeply modern society was tied to social media and digital communication, saying, "People of this century are slaves of social media. We can't go to sleep without surfing through social media, we can't get out of bed without browsing through WhatsApp, Instagram, TikTok, Snapchat, YouTube and other apps."</p>

<p>The Rub' al-Khali remains an unforgiving environment, with extreme heat, navigation difficulties, isolation, and scarce resources. Despite technological advancements, travellers in the region remain vulnerable to the harsh conditions, where a single GPS malfunction can have severe consequences, even death.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Kentucky man who was the first rioter to enter the US Capitol during the January 6, 2021, attack on Congress by Donald Trump supporters was sentenced to 53 months in prison on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Michael Sparks, 46, a factory supervisor, was convicted in March of civil disorder and disorderly and disruptive conduct in a restricted building.</p>

<p>Prosecutors had sought a sentence of 57 months while Sparks's defense attorneys asked that he be given 12 months of home detention.</p>

<p>District Judge Timothy Kelly sentenced Sparks to 53 months in prison and a $2,000 fine.</p>

<p>In their sentencing memorandum, prosecutors said Sparks was "the very first rioter to enter the United States Capitol building" and "helped light the fire that day."</p>

<p>Sparks jumped through a broken window, they said, "ignoring the warnings of the rioters behind him and the pepper spray (from US Capitol police) that hit him squarely in the face."</p>

<p>Capitol police sergeant Victor Nichols, testifying at Sparks's trial in Washington, said he "acted like a green light for everybody behind him, and everyone followed right behind him."</p>

<p>Nearly 1,500 people have been charged for their roles in the storming of Congress by supporters of former Republican president Trump.</p>

<p>David Dempsey, 37, of Santa Ana, California, described by prosecutors as one of the "most violent" members of the mob, was sentenced to 20 years in prison this month.</p>

<p>The sentence was the second longest handed down so far.</p>

<p>Enrique Tarrio, the former leader of the far-right Proud Boys group, was convicted of seditious conspiracy and sentenced to 22 years in prison.</p>

<p>The assault on the Capitol left at least five people dead and 140 police officers injured.</p>

<p>It followed a fiery speech by Trump to supporters near the White House in which he repeated his false claims that he won the 2020 election.</p>

<p>Trump faces four federal felony charges in Washington related to efforts to overturn the election results, but the case is unlikely to reach trial before the November presidential vote, in which he is once again the Republican candidate.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said on Tuesday an agreement has been reached to have closed microphones at the Sept. 10 U.S. presidential debate with Democratic rival Kamala Harris.</p>

<p>The Harris campaign did not immediately return a request for confirmation about the ABC-hosted debate.</p>

<p>The candidates campaigns clashed on Monday over the previously agreed-upon debate, with the vice president's team seeking a return to open microphones while Trump threatened to pull out entirely after suggesting the network was biased.</p>

<p>In a social media post on Tuesday, Trump said the rules for next month's debate will be the same as they were for the June CNN debate he had with President Joe Biden, whose poor performance led him to drop out of the 2024 race.</p>

<p>"The Debate will be 'stand up,' and Candidates cannot bring notes, or 'cheat sheets.' We have also been given assurance by ABC that this will be a 'fair and equitable' Debate, and that neither side will be given the questions in advance," Trump wrote.</p>

<p>The CNN debate did not have a live audience. Trump's post did not mention that.</p>

<p>Harris' campaign had said it wanted the broadcaster to keep the candidates' microphones on throughout the event, not muted when their opponent was speaking as in the last presidential debate. So-called "hot mics" can help or hurt political candidates, catching offhand comments that sometimes were not meant for the public.</p>

<p>While Trump's team said it had already agreed to have closed microphones, Trump later told reporters that he preferred to have his microphone kept on.</p>

<p>Trump's campaign has floated an additional debate on Sept. 4 on Fox News network but the Harris team rejected that.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ukrainian troops have seized 100 settlements in Russia since they broke into bordering Russia's Kursk region on August 6, Oleksandr Syrsky, Commander-in-Chief of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, said.</p>

<p>"We continue to advance forward, inflicting significant losses on the Russian troops in manpower and equipment," Syrsky was cited as saying by the Interfax-Ukraine news agency on Tuesday.</p>

<p>According to Syrsky, Russia has redeployed about 30,000 troops from other areas to the Kursk region and is now trying to form "a defensive ring" around the Ukrainian forces, Xinhua news agency reported.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Russia's Defence Ministry said in a statement on Tuesday that its Akhmat special forces had carried out a reconnaissance operation, securing a commanding height in the Sudzha district in the Kursk region, previously held by Ukraine.</p>

<p>The height was located 400-500 metres away from Ukrainian forward positions.</p>

<p>The Russian troops can now monitor Ukrainian military movements, TASS reported citing a source at the scene.</p>

<p>Syrsky said that Ukraine launched an operation in Kursk with the aim of creating a buffer zone to prevent shelling in Ukraine's adjacent Sumy region, adding that his troops continue to advance and have captured 594 Russian servicemen.</p>

<p>According to Syrskyi, Russia is trying to oppose Ukraine by withdrawing troops from other fronts.</p>

<p>He said that Russia is not withdrawing forces from the Pokrovsk front in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region, where he said the situation remained "difficult".</p>

<p>The Kursk region has been the site of an offensive since the night of August 5-6, when Ukrainian forces entered the region near the town of Sudzha, about 10 km (6.2 miles) from the border.</p>

<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin accused Kyiv of carrying out a "large-scale provocation" and "indiscriminate shooting," defining the incursion as a "terrorist attack".</p>

<p>Days later, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky admitted it was an "operation" by Ukraine's troops, specifying that the goal is to create a "buffer zone" against Russian attacks.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ahead of the presidential elections in the United States, former US President and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump accepted the debate with Vice President Kamala Harris, outlining specific conditions and rules for the face-off.</p>

<p>Sharing a post on the social media platform Truth, Trump said, "I have reached an agreement with the Radical Left Democrats for a debate with Comrade Kamala Harris. It will be broadcast live on ABC FAKE NEWS, by far the nastiest and most unfair newscaster in the business, on Tuesday, September 10th, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."</p>

<p>This comes after Trump suggested over the weekend he might cancel the debate amid a feud between the campaigns over the rules.</p>

<p>Trump said on Truth Social he and Harris had reached an agreement to follow the same set of rules he and President Joe Biden did during the June 27 CNN debate, including no live audience and muted microphones when the candidates aren't speaking.</p>

<p>"The rules will be the same as the last CNN debate, which seemed to work out well for everyone except, perhaps, Crooked Joe Biden. The debate will be "stand up," and candidates cannot bring notes, or "cheat sheets." We have also been given assurance by ABC that this will be a "fair and equitable" debate and that neither side will be given the questions in advance (No Donna Brazile!)."</p>

<p>The Republican presidential candidate further stated that a third debate has not been agreed upon by the Radical Left. The post said, "Harris would not agree to the FoxNews debate on September 4th, but that date will be held open in case she changes her mind or, Flip Flops, as she has done on every single one of her long-held and cherished policy beliefs. A possible third debate, which would go to NBC FAKE NEWS, has not been agreed to by the Radical Left. GOD BLESS AMERICA!"</p>

<p>Notably, Biden's halting and disjointed performance in his June debate with Trump at CNN ultimately led him to drop out of the presidential race.</p>

<p>Harris entered the fray for the presidential ticket after US President Joe Biden announced in July that he was withdrawing from the election bid.</p>

<p>If elected president, the 59-year-old Harris would become the first woman in history to become the US president. The vice president is only the second woman ever nominated for the presidency by a major political party.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[The World Health Organization (WHO) said today that droplets were a "minor" route of transmission for mpox compared to physical contact, saying that more research is required to understand how the virus spreads.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The World Health Organization (WHO) said today that droplets were a "minor" route of transmission for mpox compared to physical contact, adding that more research is required to understand how the virus spreads.</p>

<p>The UN health agency declared mpox a public health emergency of international concern on August 14 amid a surge of cases across the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and its neighbouring countries.</p>

<p>Mainly, two distinct clades of the virus, Ia and Ib, are causing significant concern in the DRC. A third variant, Clade II, originated in Nigeria and has been responsible for the global outbreak that began in 2022.</p>

<h3><strong>What is Mpox?</strong></h3>

<p>The mpox virus is an orthopoxvirus that causes mpox (monkeypox), a disease with symptoms similar to smallpox, although less severe, according to the WHO website.&nbsp;</p>

<p>What are the symptoms of Mpox?</p>

<ol>
	<li>Fever</li>
	<li>Extensive characteristic rash&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Swollen lymph nodes</li>
	<li>Headache</li>
	<li>Back pain and muscle ache</li>
	<li>Lack of energy</li>
</ol>

<p>The incubation period of mpox can range from 5 to 21 days. The febrile stage of illness (when fever persists) usually lasts 1 to 3 days, according to WHO. This is followed by the skin eruption stage, which can last for 2 to 4 weeks.</p>

<h3><strong>How does Mpox spread?</strong></h3>

<p>WHO has said that mpox spreads between people mainly through close physical contact with someone who has the virus. "Close contact includes skin-to-skin (such as touching or sex) and mouth-to-mouth, or mouth-to-skin contact (such as kissing)," it said.</p>

<p>However, WHO spokeswoman Margaret Harris said today that if a person with the virus had lesions, "if you're talking closely to someone, breathing on them, physically close, face-to-face, there is a possibility" of viral spread, "but this is a minor source".</p>

<p>"When you're talking to somebody, you're spitting out droplets," but "it's not a very major form of transmission -- and it's not a... through-the-air, long-distance sort of transmission," she added.</p>

<p>The WHO recommends the use of facemasks for those with mpox, their close contacts and health workers treating them.</p>

<h3><strong>Does mpox have a vaccine?</strong></h3>

<p>Yes, there are vaccines recommended by WHO for use against mpox. However, only people who are at risk should get the vaccine. WHO has not recommended mass vaccination against mpox.</p>

<h3><strong>How has India prepared for a possible mpox outbreak?</strong></h3>

<p>India currently has no active mpox cases. The government had ordered the authorities in airports, ports and borders with Bangladesh and Pakistan to remain alert about incoming international passengers who show mpox symptoms.</p>

<p>The All India Institute for Medical Sciences (AIIMS) had issued protocols for handling suspected mpox cases in India. Various government hospitals were directed to set up isolation rooms for suspected and confirmed cases of mpox.</p>

<p>The institute has recommended setting up a screening process in the triage area wherein, upon arrival, patients with fever, rash, or a history of contact with confirmed mpox cases should be flagged for immediate assessment.</p>

<p>According to an assessment, the risk of a large outbreak with sustained transmission is low, officials had said.<br />

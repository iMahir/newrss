       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mount Fuji's summer climbing season began on Monday with new crowd control measures to combat over-tourism on the Japanese volcano's most popular trail.</p>

<p>An entry fee of 2,000 yen ($13) plus an optional donation is being charged for those taking on the Yoshida Trail, and numbers are capped at 4,000 per day.</p>

<p>Online reservations have also been introduced this year by authorities concerned about safety and environmental damage on Japan's highest mountain.</p>

<p>"I really like the idea because if you respect the mountain, you have to limit the people," hiker Chetna Joshi told AFP at the trail's Fifth Station -- a busy starting point for hikers that is reachable by car.</p>

<p>The 47-year-old from India compared the crowds seen at Fuji in recent years to the "traffic jam" of climbers at the peak of Mount Everest.</p>

<p>Although windy and drizzly weather on Monday prevented hikers from reaching the summit, Joshi said ascending part way was still a "great experience".</p>

<p>"I love mountains. I think it is not giving me permission this time, that's OK. I accept it," she said.</p>

<p>Record tourist crowds are flocking to Japan post-pandemic, with many wanting to see or scale Mount Fuji.</p>

<p>The mountain is covered in snow most of the year but draws more than 220,000 visitors each July-September climbing period.</p>

<p>Many trudge through the night to see the sunrise from the 3,776-metre (12,388-foot) summit.</p>

<p>Some sleep on the trail or start fires for heat, while others attempt to complete the hike without breaks, becoming sick or injured as a result.</p>

<h3><strong>&nbsp;'Crazy adventure'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>The once-peaceful pilgrimage site has three other main routes that will remain free to climb.</p>

<p>But the Yoshida Trail -- accessed from Tokyo relatively easily -- is the preferred option for most holidaymakers, with around 60 per cent of climbers choosing that route.</p>

<p>Each summer, reports in Japanese media describe tourists climbing Mount Fuji with insufficient mountaineering equipment.</p>

<p>The new measures were introduced "first and foremost to protect lives", governor Kotaro Nagasaki of Yamanashi prefecture has said.</p>

<p>In a reminder of the dangers, last week four bodies were found near the summit, according to local media reports.</p>

<p>"I personally feel like I've over-prepared," Geoffrey Kula, a climber from the United States, told AFP.</p>

<p>"Having looked at the forecast, being ready to swap out multiple outfits if clothes get wet and things like that. Yeah, it just seems like another crazy adventure."</p>

<h3><strong>Tourist hotspot&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Monthly visitors to Japan exceeded three million for the first time in March, and then again in April and May.</p>

<p>The tourism chief has deemed the country's ambitious goal of attracting 60 million foreign tourists well within reach, having last year welcomed more than 25 million.</p>

<p>Mount Fuji is about two hours from central Tokyo by train and can be seen for miles around.</p>

<p>The mountain is a symbol of Japan that has been immortalised in countless artworks, including Hokusai's "Great Wave".</p>

<p>But as in other tourist hotspots, such as Venice -- which recently launched a trial of entry fees for day visitors -- the influx has not been universally welcomed.</p>

<p>In May, a town near Mount Fuji mounted a large barrier at a popular viewing spot for the volcano in an attempt to deter photo-taking by an ever-growing number of tourists.</p>

<p>Residents were fed up with streams of mostly foreign visitors littering, trespassing and breaking traffic rules in their hunt for a photo to share on social media.</p>

<p>Similar woes have befallen the country's ancient capital of Kyoto, where locals have complained of tourists harassing the city's famed geisha.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Eminent Indian-American physician Dr Sampat Shivangi has been elected as an official delegate to the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee this month that would formally nominate former US president Donald Trump as the party's presidential candidate.</p>

<p>Trump, 78, is the presumptive Republican Party candidate for the presidential election.</p>

<p>An influential Indian-American community leader, Dr Shivangi, has been elected as a National Delegate at the convention for the sixth time.</p>

<p>"It is a great pleasure and honour to share the news that I have been nominated and elected as (an) official delegate at the upcoming Republican National Convention to be held in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, from July 13 to July 19, 2024," Dr Shivangi said.</p>

<p>The four-day Republican National Convention (RNC) in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, would formally nominate Trump as the party's candidate for the November 5 presidential election.</p>

<p>The nomination process would be completed by Republican delegates from across the country.</p>

<p>Dr Shivangi, a lifelong member of the Republican Party and a founding member of the Republican Indian Council and the Republican Indian National Council, has been nominated as RNC delegate six consecutive times.</p>

<p>"This will be my sixth time serving as a National Delegate at the Republican National Convention to nominate the Republican Party nominee to contest the national presidential election," he said.</p>

<p>"My nomination began as early as when President George W Bush was nominated in New York, then-Senator George McCain, Governor Mitt Romney, (and) President Donald Trump in 2016 and 2020. Now again to re-elect President Donald Trump in 2024 in Milwaukee," he said.</p>

<p>He is the national president of the Indian American Forum for Political Education, one of the oldest Indian American Associations.</p>

<p>Over the past three decades, he has lobbied for several bills in the US Congress on behalf of India through his enormous contacts with US Senators and Congressmen.</p>

<p>"I feel this is a unique honour and an opportunity for an Indian American to represent the community at the national level," he said.</p>

<p>Dr Shivangi said he would be part of the luncheon hosted by Governor Tate Reeves of Mississippi in honour of the delegates at Northern Lights in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on July 16, for the Mississippi delegates</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Ashwin Ramaswami, the first Gen-Z Indian-American candidate to run for a US state legislature, has been endorsed by US Senator Jon Ossoff for the Georgia state Senate seat.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ashwin Ramaswami, the first Gen-Z Indian-American candidate to run for a US state legislature, has been endorsed by US Senator Jon Ossoff for the Georgia state Senate seat.</p>

<p>Ramaswami, 24, is contesting in the Democratic Party for State Senate in District 48 in the US state of Georgia.</p>

<p>The endorsement is seen as a big boost to his maiden campaign against incumbent State Senator Shawn Still, a Republican, who has been indicted for trying to overturn the 2020 election results in Georgia.</p>

<p>Still was indicted with former president Donald Trump for the January 6, 2021, insurrection at the US Capitol.</p>

<p>"Ashwin Ramaswami would be a tireless advocate for democracy and his constituents in the Georgia State Senate," said Senator Ossoff.</p>

<p>"The contrast could not be clearer: Ashwin is a former election security expert, and he is running against a MAGA (Make American Great Again) politician alleged to have participated in an effort to steal the 2020 election when Raphael Warnock and I were on the ballot," he said.</p>

<p>"It's not an exaggeration to say that democracy is on the ballot in Senate District 48. We need Ashwin in the State Senate - and I'm proud to stand behind him in this race," Ossoff said.</p>

<p>Thanking the Senator for the endorsement, Ramaswami said, "From delivering billions in Georgia infrastructure upgrades to tackling climate change to strengthening our cybersecurity - Senator Ossoff has been a champion for Georgia." "But those successes only go so far if they're eroded by far-right Republicans like my opponent at the state level," he said.</p>

<p>"I'm so grateful to earn Senator Ossoff's support, and I look forward to working with him in the fight to expand healthcare access, invest in housing options, and protect our elections from extremists who seek to undermine them," he added.</p>

<p>Senator Ossoff is a member of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs (HSGAC), which oversees the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA).</p>

<p>Ramaswami left his job in election security at CISA to run against Still.</p>

<p>According to the latest finance report, he has outraised his opponent, raising more than USD 280,000 in his grassroots campaign.</p>

<p>Ramaswamy graduated from Georgetown University in May. If elected, he would be the youngest ever elected representative in the State of Georgia and the first Indian American to win this position in Georgia.</p>

<p>Ramaswami's parents immigrated to the US from Tamil Nadu in 1990. Generation Z (also known as Zoomers) encompasses those born between 1997 and 2012.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US Justice Department is offering Boeing a plea deal that will allow it to avoid a trial related to two deadly 737 MAX crashes, a lawyer for the victims' families said Sunday, expressing outrage.</p>

<p>Details of the deal, which requires Boeing to pay a fine and submit to an outside supervisor, were given to the families in a two-hour presentation by the Department of Justice (DOJ) on Sunday, said Paul Cassell, a University of Utah law professor who represents the families.</p>

<p>He said the families "will strenuously object" to the agreement if Boeing ultimately accepts and it is presented to a judge.</p>

<p>Contacted by AFP, Boeing declined to comment.</p>

<p>The New York Times reported over a week ago that prosecutors were eying such an alternative settlement, known as a deferred prosecution agreement, or DPA, but the DOJ said it had not yet made a decision.</p>

<p>In May, the DOJ concluded that Boeing could be prosecuted for violating a previous DPA reached following the two fatal 737 MAX crashes in 2018 and 2019, which claimed 346 lives.</p>

<p>Under that three-year deal, Boeing agreed to pay $2.5 billion to settle fraud charges related to the certification of the 737 MAX.</p>

<p>But the aviation giant came under renewed scrutiny early this year after a 737 MAX operated by Alaska Airlines was forced to make an emergency landing after a fuselage panel blew out mid-flight.</p>

<p>The January 5 incident brought Boeing's manufacturing processes back into the spotlight, prompting regulator scrutiny and congressional investigations.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the victims' families have repeatedly urged federal prosecutors to bring Boeing to court versus reaching another settlement.</p>

<p>But prosecutors also faced pressure not to further damage Boeing, a company seen as critical to the US aviation industry as well as national security.</p>

<p>In his presentation on Sunday, the lead US prosecutor "admitted there is 'a strong interest' by the families to go to trial, but he repeatedly said that the DOJ couldn't prove charges by a reasonable doubt," Cassell said.</p>

<p>"Families argued over and over for a trial and to allow a jury to make that decision," he said.</p>

<p>Boeing contested the DOJ's conclusions in mid-June but has recognized the gravity of the safety crisis.</p>

<p>CEO Dave Calhoun, who has agreed to step down later in the year, told a recent congressional hearing that the company is "taking action and making progress."</p>

<p>Ultimately, it will be up to the federal judge in Texas who is overseeing the case to decide if the new DPA goes through.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A woman prison officer in the UK has been charged following the discovery of a social media video allegedly showing her having sex with an inmate at HMP Wandsworth, a prison in southwest London, a<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c72v3338v0qo"> report</a> said.</p>

<p>Linda De Sousa Abreu, 30, from Fulham, west London, faces charges of misconduct in public office. She is scheduled to appear at Uxbridge Magistrates' Court today.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Metropolitan Police launched an investigation on Friday after the video, allegedly filmed within the prison, surfaced online. The footage reportedly shows the officer initially in full uniform before engaging in the alleged act.</p>

<p>HMP Wandsworth, a Victorian-era prison built in 1851, has been grappling with severe overcrowding and deteriorating conditions. Recent inspections revealed troubling issues, including rampant violence, vermin, and severe staffing challenges. The facility, designed for significantly fewer inmates, currently operates at 163 per cent of its intended capacity, housing over 1,500 prisoners.</p>

<p>The situation at the prison has prompted urgent calls for reform. In May, Chief Inspector of Prisons Charlie Taylor issued an "urgent notification" to Justice Secretary Alex Chalk, highlighting the dire state of the prison and the need for immediate improvements. Taylor's report described the prison's wings as "chaotic" and noted the inability of staff to manage or account for prisoners effectively. This led to the resignation of the prison's governor, Katie Price, amid the inspection.</p>

<p>A spokesperson for Scotland Yard <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/article/2024/jun/29/woman-arrested-after-video-apparently-shows-uk-prison-officer-having-sex-with-inmate">confirmed</a> the ongoing investigation. "Staff corruption is not tolerated, and the former prison officer allegedly featured in this video has been reported to the police," said a Prison Service representative. They refrained from further comments due to the active investigation.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[The United Kingdom heads to the polls on Thursday in a general election that is expected to see the main opposition Labour Party return to power after 14 years.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United Kingdom heads to the polls on Thursday in a general election that is expected to see the main opposition Labour Party return to power after 14 years.</p>

<p>Here are the main players in the nationwide vote.</p>

<h3><strong>Keir Starmer&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Labour leader Keir Starmer is a former human rights lawyer and chief public prosecutor tipped by pollsters to win the election and become prime minister.</p>

<p>Starmer, 61, has been credited with moving his party back to the centre ground and rooting out anti-Semitism since succeeding left-winger Jeremy Corbyn as leader in April 2020.</p>

<p>Supporters see him as a pragmatic, safe pair of hands, ideally suited to managing Britain back from economic decline.</p>

<p>Critics accuse him of being an uninspiring flip-flopper who has failed to spell out a clear vision for the country during a cautious campaign.</p>

<p>Starmer was born in London to a toolmaker father and a nurse mother. His unusual first name was his socialist parents' tribute to Labour's founding father -- Keir Hardie.</p>

<p>The keen footballer and Arsenal fan was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II for services to criminal justice but rarely uses the prefix "Sir" before his name.</p>

<h3><strong>Rishi Sunak&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Sunak, 44, is seeking his own mandate from the British public having been installed as Conservative leader, and therefore prime minister, by his own MPs in October 2022.</p>

<p>He succeeded Liz Truss, who was ousted following just 49 days in power after her tax-cutting economic agenda spooked markets and lost her the support of her party.</p>

<p>Sunak, who is of Indian descent, is the UK's first British Asian and Hindu prime minister.</p>

<p>The ex-financier has been credited with steadying government following the chaos of the Truss and Boris Johnson premierships and for slashing inflation.</p>

<p>He has failed though to meet several promises, including cutting health waiting lists, stopping irregular immigration, and sending migrants to Rwanda.</p>

<p>Sunak has run a lacklustre and mishap-strewn campaign, which started with his rain-sodden announcement of the election date and included criticism for skipping the main D-Day anniversary event.</p>

<p>Opinion polls give him some of the lowest approval ratings of any prime minister ever.</p>

<h3><strong>Nigel Farage&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>The 60-year-old beer-loving, cigarette-smoking ex-member of the European Parliament is one of the most divisive personalities in UK politics.</p>

<p>He gained the nickname "Mr Brexit" from former US president Donald Trump after helping to persuade a majority of Britons in 2016 to vote to leave the European Union.</p>

<p>The arch-Eurosceptic is a perennial loser at Westminster though and is seeking to become an MP at the eighth time of asking.</p>

<p>He heads the hard-right Reform UK party, whose poll numbers indicate it could deprive the Conservatives of several key seats needed to win re-election.</p>

<p>Farage has become engulfed in a racism scandal after several Reform activists were filmed making racist and homophobic remarks.</p>

<p>Reform, which Farage co-founded in 2018, disowned three candidates over the weekend due to offensive comments.</p>

<p>Farage also faced criticism for saying that the West "provoked" Russia into invading Ukraine.</p>

<h3><strong>Swinney, Davey and Denyer&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Neither Ed Davey's Liberal Democrats nor John Swinney's Scottish National Party (SNP) will win the election -- but they could have a say in who does.</p>

<p>Davey, 58, hopes his party can stop a Conservative victory by winning several seats in southern England as it eyes overtaking the SNP to regain its position as the third-largest party in parliament.</p>

<p>He has mixed campaigning on serious issues such as adult social care and polluted waterways with irreverent stunts like falling off a paddleboard and tackling an obstacle course.</p>

<p>Swinney, 60, does not sit in the UK parliament but is first minister in the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh, having taken over the leadership of the SNP in May following Humza Yousaf's resignation.</p>

<p>His SNP is struggling to fend off a Labour resurgence in Scotland, which could kill off its independence hopes for a generation.</p>

<p>Green Party co-leader Carla Denyer, 38, is hoping to win the new seat of Bristol Central as the fringe outfit targets increasing its representation from one to four MPs.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US Supreme Court is expected to rule Monday on the most highly anticipated decision of its term -- a ruling "for the ages" on whether Donald Trump, as a former president, is immune from prosecution.</p>

<p>Even if the ruling is likely to reject Trump's claim he should enjoy absolute immunity, the decision will be key in whether his trial for conspiring to overturn his 2020 election loss can go ahead before this year's election, in which he is the Republican candidate.</p>

<p>"We are writing a rule for the ages," said conservative justice Neil Gorsuch, who was appointed by Trump, as arguments were heard in April.</p>

<p>"This case has huge implications for the presidency, for the future of the presidency, for the future of the country," added Justice Brett Kavanaugh, another Trump appointee.</p>

<p>Trump's original trial date in the election case had been March 4, well before his November rematch with President Joe Biden.</p>

<p>But the Supreme Court -- dominated by conservatives, including the three appointed by Trump during his term in office -- agreed in February to hear his argument for presidential immunity, putting the case on hold while they considered the matter in April.</p>

<p>That means the trial has already been considerably delayed.</p>

<p>The court is unlikely to rule that Trump has complete immunity. During the April arguments, the justices appeared largely sceptical of his claims, with some questioning whether it meant a president could "commit crimes with abandon."</p>

<p>However, the scope and wording of the decision could further postpone the trial -- shrinking the odds that Trump will face prosecutors before the November 5 vote.</p>

<p>For instance, justices could send the case back to lower courts to sort out which of the special counsel's allegations against 78-year-old Trump concern official acts, and thus could be immune from prosecution.</p>

<p>That would inevitably further push back the trial, a complicated undertaking which, regardless of the ruling, will take months of preparation to get back on track.</p>

<p>Facing four criminal cases, Trump has been doing everything in his power to delay the trials at least until after the election.</p>

<p>On May 30, a New York court convicted Trump on 34 felony charges of falsifying business records to cover up a sex scandal in the final stages of the 2016 presidential campaign, making Trump the first former US president ever convicted of a crime. His sentencing will take place on July 11.</p>

<p>The New York hush money case was considered the weakest of the four cases by many legal experts, but likely the only one that will see trial before the vote.</p>

<p>By filing many pre-trial motions, Trump's lawyers have managed to put on hold the three other trials, which deal with his attempts to overturn the 2020 election results and hoarding top-secret documents at his home in Florida.</p>

<p>If re-elected, Trump could, once sworn in as president in January 2025, order the federal trials against him closed.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli forces advanced further on Sunday into the Shejaia neighbourhood of northern Gaza and also pushed deeper into western and central Rafah in the south, killing at least six Palestinians and destroying several homes, residents said.</p>

<p>Israeli tanks, which moved back into Shejaia four days ago, fired shells towards several houses, leaving families trapped inside and unable to leave, the residents said.</p>

<p>Speaking at a weekly cabinet meeting on Sunday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu repeated his stance that there is no substitute for victory in the war against the Islamist operative Hamas.</p>

<p>"We are committed to fighting until we achieve all of our objectives: Eliminating Hamas, returning all of our hostages, ensuring that Gaza never again constitutes a threat to Israel and returning our residents securely to their homes in the south and the north," he said.</p>

<p>While the offensive focused on Gaza, in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, one man was killed and five were wounded in an Israeli strike near the city of Tulkarm, according to the Palestinian health ministry. The dead man was a member of an operative Islamic Jihad, the group said. The Israeli military issued no comment.</p>

<p>Hours after Netanyahu's comments about Gaza, the armed wing of Hamas released a video purporting to show weapons-making, in a show of defiance.</p>

<p>The video, which was not immediately verified by Reuters, showed fighters preparing anti-tank rocket warheads. In the background, a large TV screen showed recent news events to indicate the video was recent.</p>

<p>"Our preparation is continuing," said writing at the end of the short film.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said forces operating in Shejaia had killed several Palestinian gunmen over the past day and found military infrastructure inside a United Nations school as well as dozens of weapons and "valuable intelligence documents".</p>

<p>On Saturday the military announced the death of two Israeli soldiers in northern Gaza.</p>

<p>In another raid in Shejaia, the forces located a "terrorist war room" at a clinic, said the military, which again accused Hamas of "embedding itself in civilian structures for terror purposes".</p>

<p>Hamas denies using civilian sites such as schools and hospitals for military purposes.</p>

<p>The armed wing of Hamas and the allied Islamic Jihad reported fierce fighting in both Shejaia and Rafah, saying their fighters had fired anti-tank rockets and mortar bombs against Israeli forces operating there.</p>

<p>More than eight months into Israel's air and ground war in Gaza, operatives continue to stage attacks on Israeli forces, operating in areas that the Israeli army said it had gained control over months ago.</p>

<h3><strong>STALLED CEASEFIRE EFFORTS</strong></h3>

<p>Arab mediators' efforts, backed by the United States, have stalled. Hamas says any deal must end the war and bring a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. Israel says it will accept only temporary pauses in the fighting until Hamas, which has governed Gaza since 2007, is eradicated.</p>

<p>The war began when Hamas-led operatives stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, killing around 1,200 people and seizing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory offensive has so far killed nearly 38,000 people, according to the Gaza health ministry, and has left the heavily built-up coastal enclave in ruins.</p>

<p>The ministry does not distinguish between combatants and non-combatants but officials say most of the dead are civilians. More than 300 Israeli soldiers have been killed in Gaza and Israel says at least a third of the Palestinian dead are fighters.</p>

<p>Israeli tanks pushed deeper into several districts in the east, west and centre of Rafah, near the border with Egypt, on Sunday, and medics said six people had been killed in an Israeli strike on a house in Shaboura, in the heart of the city.</p>

<p>The six bodies from the Zurub family were transferred to Nasser Hospital in the nearby city of Khan Younis, where dozens of relatives paid their respects.</p>

<p>Residents said the Israeli army had torched the Al-Awda mosque in the centre of Rafah, one of the city's best-known.</p>

<p>Israel has said its military operations in Rafah are aimed at eradicating the last armed battalions of Hamas.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>France's far right was on Sunday eyeing a historic chance to form a government and claim the post of prime minister after winning the first round of legislative elections with the centrist forces of President Emmanuel Macron coming in only third.</p>

<p>But it remained unclear if the far-right National Rally (RN) party of Marine Le Pen would win the absolute majority of seats in the new National Assembly in the July 7 second round. That is what it would need to be certain of taking power and for Le Pen's protege Jordan Bardella, 28, to become prime minister.</p>

<p>Macron had stunned the nation and baffled even some allies by calling snap polls after the RN trounced his centrist forces in European Parliament elections this month.</p>

<p>But that gamble risks backfiring, with Macron's alliance now expected to win a far smaller minority contingent in parliament. That would make the president a far less powerful figure for the remaining three years of his term.</p>

<p>Projections from prominent French polling firms gave the RN 33.2-33.5 percent of the vote, compared to 28.1-28.5 percent for the left-wing New Popular Front alliance, and 21.0-22.1 percent for Macron's centrist camp.</p>

<p>The polling agencies projected this would give the RN a majority of seats in the 577-seat National Assembly after the second round. But it was far from clear the party would garner the 289 seats needed for an absolute majority.</p>

<p>The projections varied sharply, with Ipsos forecasting 230-280 seats, Ifop 240-270 and Elabe the only organisation to put it in the range of an absolute majority on 260-310 seats.</p>

<p>In a statement, Macron called for a "broad" alliance against the far right in the second round, which will see run-off votes where there was no outright winner in the first round.</p>

<p>The leftwing alliance and the president's camp will be hoping that tactical voting to prevent RN candidates winning seats will leave it short of the absolute majority.</p>

<p>French Prime Minister Gabriel Attal, who is likely to be forced to resign after the second round, warned the far right was now at the "gates of power". The RN should not get a "single vote" in the second round, he said.</p>

<p>"We have seven days to spare France from catastrophe," said Raphael Glucksmann, a key figure in the left-wing alliance.</p>

<h3><strong>'Prime minister of all French'</strong></h3>

<p>With the French facing their most polarising choices in recent history, turnout soared to 65 percent, way above the turnout in 2022 polls of just 47.5 percent.</p>

<p>Macron said the high turnout in the first round spoke of "the importance of this vote for all our compatriots and the desire to clarify the political situation".</p>

<p>The arrival of anti-immigration and eurosceptic RN in government would be a turning point in French modern history and be the first time a far-right force has taken power in the country since World War II when it was occupied by Nazi Germany.</p>

<p>"Nothing is won and the second round is decisive," Le Pen, who has long worked to distance the party from its extremist origins, told supporters.</p>

<p>"We need an absolute majority so that Jordan Bardella is in eight days named prime minister by Emmanuel Macron."</p>

<p>Bardella said he wanted to be the "prime minister of all French".</p>

<p>This would create a tense period of "cohabitation" with Macron, who has vowed to serve out his term until 2027.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bardella has said he will only form a government if the RN wins an absolute majority in the elections.</p>

<h3><strong>'Heavy defeat'</strong></h3>

<p>The alternative is months of political paralysis and negotiations to find a solution for a sustainable government that can survive no-confidence votes.</p>

<p>Hard-left leader Jean-Luc Melenchon said Macron's centrist alliance had suffered a "heavy and undisputable" defeat in the snap polls.</p>

<p>Risk analysis firm Eurasia Group said the RN now looked "likely" to fall short of an absolute majority. France was facing "at least 12 months with a rancorously blocked National Assembly and -- at best -- a technocratic government of 'national unity' with limited capacity to govern", it added.</p>

<p>Macron's decision to call the snap vote sparked uncertainty in Europe's second-biggest economy. The Paris stock exchange suffered its biggest monthly decline in two years in June, dropping by 6.4 percent, according to figures released on Friday.</p>

<p>The turmoil also risks undermining Macron's stature as an international leader taking a prime role in helping Ukraine fight the Russian invasion. In the immediate aftermath of the second round he is due to attend the NATO summit in Washington.</p>

<p>French daily Liberation urged voters to unite to halt the march of the far-right. "After the shock, form a block," the newspaper said on its Monday front page.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p>

<p>While President Joe Biden was away at Camp David for a long-planned family get-together, key US Democratic leaders stood firmly behind his back, rejecting the notion that he should end his 2024 campaign for a second four-year term in the White House because of his halting and disjointed debate performance last week against former President Donald Trump, reported Voice of America (VOA).</p>

<p>The Democratic allies of Biden readily acknowledged the 81-year-old Biden's shortcomings in the nationally televised 90-minute debate in which he struggled at times to complete sentences and at one point mistakenly said he had killed off Medicare, the government's health insurance program for older Americans.</p>

<p>According to a new CBS-YouGov poll, Americans, by a 72-27 per cent margin, do not think that Biden has the "mental and cognitive health to serve as president," a reading that was seven percentage points worse on the same question compared to three weeks ago, VOA reported.</p>

<p>However, national polling between Biden and Trump still showed the contest remains a dead heat.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the key Democratic officials rejected the suggestion of some rank-and-file Democrats and editorials in The New York Times and The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that he drop out of the race for a younger candidate.</p>

<p>"The unfortunate truth is that Biden should withdraw from the race, for the good of the nation he has served so admirably for half a century," the Atlanta Journal-Constitution said.</p>

<p>The Atlanta Journal-Constitution is the leading newspaper in the key southern political battleground state of Georgia.</p>

<p>"The shade of retirement is now necessary for President Biden," it added, according to VOA.</p>

<p>"Oh, absolutely not," Georgia Democratic Senator Raphael Warnock told NBC's "Meet the Press" program. "Bad debates happen. The question is, 'Who has Donald Trump ever shown up for other than himself and people like himself?' I'm with Joe Biden, and it's our assignment to make sure that he gets over the finish line come November."</p>

<p>Representative Jim Clyburn of South Carolina, a prominent Biden supporter, told CNN's "State of the Union" show, "I do not believe that Joe Biden has a problem leading for the next four years because he's done a great job of leading for the last three-and-a-half years. I always say that the best predictor of future behaviour is past performance."</p>

<p>He contended that what happened at the debate was "preparation overload", reported VOA.</p>

<p>Governor Wes Moore of Maryland said on CBS's "Face the Nation," that "the president had a difficult night just like every single one of us do" but that it should not force him out of the November 5 election.</p>

<p>"Joe Biden is not going to take himself out of this race, nor should he." Biden's campaign, in a Saturday night fundraising appeal, says replacing him as the Democratic standard-bearer would lead to weeks of chaos before the August national party convention to pick a new nominee and be "a highway to losing" the national election.</p>

<p>Kate Bedingfield, a former Biden White House communications aide, told CNN that the Biden campaign had raised USD 33 million since the debate.</p>

<p>Reince Priebus, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee and once Trump's White House chief of staff, called Biden staying in the race "just all downside for Joe Biden."</p>

<p>"This is not a bad debate night," he said on ABC's "This Week" show. "This was an incoherent, almost impossible mess."</p>

<p>Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, said, "He's (Biden) a decent man. He's a failed president. He is compromised. That's the storyline here. That's what the world saw, a compromised president."</p>

<p>Biden, after spending the weekend at campaign fundraising events in New York and New Jersey, went to Camp David, the presidential retreat outside Washington, for a long-planned family get-together, according to VOA.</p>

<p>Joe Biden has not indicated that he plans to drop out of the race and, in fact, voiced just the opposite.</p>

<p>On Friday, the day after the debate, Biden told supporters, "I know I'm not a young man. I don't walk as easily as I used to. I don't speak as smoothly as I used to. I don't debate as well as I used to, but I know what I do know: I know how to tell the truth!"</p>

<p>Biden added that he would not be running for a second term if he did not believe "with all my heart and soul I can do this."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Passengers and crew of a British Airways flight who were taken hostage in Kuwait in 1990 have launched legal action against the UK government and the airline, a law firm said Monday.</p>

<p>People on BA flight 149 were taken off the Kuala Lumpur-bound plane when it landed in the Gulf state on August 2 that year, hours after Iraq's then leader Saddam Hussein invaded the country.</p>

<p>Some of the 367 passengers and crew spent more than four months in captivity, including as human shields against Western attacks on the Iraqi dictator's troops during the first Gulf war.</p>

<p>Ninety-four of them have filed a civil claim at the High Court in London, accusing Britain's government and BA of "deliberately endangering" civilians, said McCue Jury &amp; Partners.</p>

<p>"All of the claimants suffered severe physical and psychiatric harm during their ordeal, the consequences of which are still felt today," the law firm added.</p>

<p>The action claims that the UK government and the airline "knew the invasion had started" but allowed the flight to land anyway.</p>

<p>They did so because the flight was used to "insert a covert special ops team into occupied Kuwait", the firm added.</p>

<p>"We were not treated as citizens but as expendable pawns for commercial and political gain," said Barry Manners, who was on the flight and is taking part in the claim.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"A victory over years of cover-up and bare-faced denial will help restore trust in our political and judicial process," he added.</p>

<p>British government files released in November 2021 revealed that the UK ambassador to Kuwait informed London about reports of an Iraqi incursion before the flight landed but the message was not passed on to BA.</p>

<p>There have also been claims, denied by the government, that London knowingly put passengers at risk by using the flight to deploy undercover operatives and delayed take-off to allow them to board.</p>

<p>The UK government refused to comment on ongoing legal matters.</p>

<p>British Airways has always denied accusations of negligence, conspiracy and a cover-up.</p>

<p>The airline did not respond to a request for comment from AFP but said last year that the records released in 2021 "confirmed British Airways was not warned about the invasion".&nbsp;</p>

<p>McCue Jury &amp; Partners had announced in September its intention to file the suit, saying then that the hostages "may claim an estimated average of £170,000 ($213,000) each in damages".&nbsp;</p>

<p>In 2003, a French court ordered BA to pay 1.67 million euros to the flight's French hostages, saying it had "seriously failed in its obligations" to them by landing the plane.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>North Korea on Monday launched two ballistic missiles, South Korea's military confirmed -- the latest in a series of weapons tests by Pyongyang that have soured relations with Seoul.</p>

<p>A short-range ballistic missile was launched in the early morning hours, the South's military Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement. About 10 minutes later, a second missile, this one as yet unidentified, was detected, it added.</p>

<p>"Our military has strengthened surveillance and vigilance in preparation for further launches," the JCS said, adding it had shared information about the incidents with the United States and Japan.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The North's official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) did not offer immediate confirmation of the launches.</p>

<p>Last week, North Korea claimed to have successfully tested a multiple warhead missile, but the South said that launch ended in a mid-air explosion.</p>

<p>Relations between the two Koreas are at one of their lowest points in years, with the North ramping up weapons testing while bombarding the South with balloons full of trash.</p>

<p>Pyongyang says those missives are in retaliation for balloons loaded with anti-regime propaganda leaflets sent northwards by activists in the South.</p>

<p>In response to the North's repeated launches, South Korea has fully suspended a tension-reducing military treaty. It also resumed propaganda loudspeaker broadcasts and live-fire drills near the border.</p>

<p>South Korea also has grown anxious over the North's warming relations with its isolated neighbour Russia.</p>

<p>North Korea is accused of breaching arms control measures by supplying weapons to Russia to use in its war in Ukraine, and Russian President Vladimir Putin held a summit with leader Kim Jong Un in Pyongyang in June in a show of unity.</p>

<p>On Sunday, Pyongyang condemned joint military drills by South Korea, Japan and the United States, calling them an "Asian version of NATO" and warning of "fatal consequences".</p>

<p>The three-day "Freedom Edge" exercises included preparation in ballistic missile and air defences, anti-submarine warfare and defensive cyber training.</p>

<p>Pyongyang has always decried similar combined exercises as rehearsals for an invasion, but Seoul said Sunday the latest exercises were a continuation of defensive drills held regularly for years.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President Joe Biden's train-wreck debate with Republican opponent Donald Trump followed a series of decisions by his most senior advisers that critics now point to as wrong-headed, interviews with Democratic allies, donors and former and current aides show.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Trump, 78, repeated a series of well-worn, glaring falsehoods during the 90-minute debate on Thursday, including claims that he actually won the 2020 election.</p>

<p>Biden, 81, failed to refute them and his fumbling, halting performance has sparked calls from Democrats for him to end his quest for a second term and for "soul-searching" or resignations among top aides.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"My only request was make sure he's rested before the debate, but he was exhausted. He was unwell," said one person who said they appealed to Biden's top aides in the days before, to no avail. "What a bad decision to send him out looking sick and exhausted."</p>

<p>Others were even more pointed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"It is my belief that he was over-coached, over-practiced. And I believe [senior aide] Anita Dunn... put him in a venue that was conducive for Trump and not for him,” said John Morgan, a Florida-based attorney and major Biden fundraiser.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Morgan suggested Dunn and other aides "be fired forever and never let back anywhere near the campaign."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Biden's debate strategy was signed off on by campaign chair Jen O'Malley Dillon, who helped him win in 2020 and was appointed in January to boost an uneven reelection campaign. Dunn, a longtime Biden aide and former Barack Obama campaign strategist, backed that strategy.</p>

<p>Confidence going into the event was high. Trump was convicted of falsifying documents by a jury in New York on May 31, while Biden held back-to-back visits in Europe.</p>

<p>To the surprise of some Biden aides, his stubbornly low poll numbers began to inch up nationally in the weeks that followed.</p>

<p>Advisers set up a rigorous debate prep calendar, with Biden sequestered at Camp David for six days.&nbsp;</p>

<p>An inner circle, some close to Biden for decades, were involved: Ron Klain, his first White House chief of staff, Dunn, former White House counsel and Dunn's husband Bob Bauer and long-time adviser Mike Donilon, as well as about a dozen other policy and political experts.</p>

<p>Biden's campaign said on Friday that no staff shake-up was under consideration. A spokesman for Dunn said multiple aides were involved in the preparation, and noted that Morgan was not there.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In an email to supporters Saturday, O'Malley Dillon said internal polls and focus groups showed no change in voters' opinions in battleground states after the debate. She warned "overblown media narratives" may drive "temporary dips in the polls," but said she was confident Biden would win in November.&nbsp;</p>

<p>FACTS AND ZINGERS&nbsp;</p>

<p>Biden's trips abroad, especially to France earlier this month, generated Republican social media clips poking fun at his age but, his team believed, it also showed him as a strong leader on an international stage.</p>

<p>White House aides who traveled with the president were in a good mood as he headed to Camp David on June 21. They believed Biden was going into the debate with the most precious political asset: momentum, the wind at his back.</p>

<p>Biden had flown to France, back to the United States, to Italy, and to the West Coast, among other travels, over a 14-day period before taking just a few days to rest at his vacation home in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He was dragging, according to several people who observed him during this period.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As Biden and his aides settled in at Camp David six days before the debate, aides figured he had a lot to accomplish, more than his opponent. Trump could just complain about the present administration - and Biden would need the facts and some zingers at his fingertips.</p>

<p>They expected Trump would be far more disciplined and prepared than he had been in 2020 and believed that they would need to counter a string of rapid-fire lies.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In lengthy prep sessions, they peppered Biden with details, then followed them up with mock debates.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Critics say now that the preparation should have focused on the bigger vision he needs to sell to the country, and that Biden had insufficient rest headed into the debate.</p>

<p>Run down, Biden would also catch a small cold, White House aides said, as he has regularly during his term after long stretches of time zone-bending work.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The result, critics say, was candidate Biden at his worst: He appeared on stage with his face wan, his hair straggly at his collar and his voice hoarse. He was frequently incoherent.</p>

<p>"I've never seen him perform that way before," said Michael LaRosa, former special assistant to President Biden and press secretary for first lady Jill Biden.</p>

<p>"He can run circles around most people on matters of complex policy," LaRosa said. "This was always going to be a matter of presentation and cosmetics, and superficial judgments that were going to be made about his performance. And he wasn't able to clear the bar."&nbsp;</p>

<p>NEW DEBATE FORUM&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Earlier this year, some Biden aides discussed whether he should debate Trump at all, arguing that it could give Trump a broad public platform that would disadvantage Biden.</p>

<p>Then Biden himself, in an April interview with shock jock Howard Stern, delivered a decision on debating Trump that was a surprise to some advisers. "I am, somewhere," he said.</p>

<p>The triumphant memory of his State of the Union address in March fresh in their minds, Biden's team geared up to debate but took radical steps to control the terms.</p>

<p>They decided to reject three long-scheduled presidential debates in September and October organized by the Commission on Presidential Debates, still smarting over the group's handling of the 2020 debates.</p>

<p>Trump repeatedly violated the rules of what would be a chaotic first debate in 2020, showing up despite having tested positive for COVID-19, and talking over Biden relentlessly.</p>

<p>His team tried to set the contest on their own terms, with what they saw as a more pliant host in CNN. No audience cheering Trump's invective. Networks and moderators inclined to challenge Trump. No Robert F. Kennedy Jr. A mute button.</p>

<p>The day after the debate, Biden bounced back with a forceful speech in North Carolina, and a pledge to keep going. Many donors and Democrats are rallying around him.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But the damage has been done.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Asked on Sunday whether the Democratic Party was discussing a new 2024 candidate, Maryland Congressman Jamie Raskin told MSNBC: "There are very honest and serious and rigorous conversations taking place at every level of our party, because it is a political party and we have differences in point of view."</p>

<p>Raskin added: "Whether he's the candidate or someone else is the candidate, he's going to be the keynote speaker at our convention."&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>South African president Cyril Ramaphosa announced his new government on Sunday with the opposition receiving 12 out of 32 portfolios following tough coalition negotiations after the ruling ANC lost its outright parliamentary majority.</p>

<p>The African National Congress, which has governed the country since the advent of democracy in 1994, retained 20 out of 32 cabinet positions, including key ministries such as foreign affairs, finance, defence, justice and police.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The largest coalition partner, the Democratic Alliance (DA), will hold six portfolios including home affairs, environment and public works.</p>

<p>The DA's leader John Steenhuisen, 48, was appointed Minister of Agriculture.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Zulu nationalist Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) and other smaller parties scored six in total including land reform, correctional services, sports, tourism and public service.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The establishment of the Government of National Unity in its current form is unprecedented in the history of our democracy," the 71-year-old Ramaphosa said, speaking from Pretoria in a televised speech.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He was re-elected for a second full term last week, to lead what his humbled ANC calls a government of national unity (GNU) after losing its outright majority in the May 29 general election.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The incoming government will prioritise rapid, inclusive and sustainable economic growth and a creation of a more just society by tackling poverty and inequality as well as unemployment," he said.</p>

<p>Adding that he had to "ensure all the parties are able to participate meaningfully in the national executive as well as various parliamentary positions".</p>

<p>The only other time South Africa has opted for a national unity government was at the end of apartheid, with Nelson Mandela and FW de Klerk, the former leader of the government, overseeing the transition to democracy as executive deputy presidents.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Tough negotiations</h2>

<p>The ANC's fall from grace came against a backdrop of high violent crime rates, a lacklustre economy and a crippling energy crisis.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ramaphosa's highly anticipated announcement comes after weeks of tough negotiations between the ANC and the DA, which won 87 parliamentary seats (22 percent of the popular vote) compared to the ANC's 159 (40 percent).&nbsp;</p>

<p>The turbulent build-up to the country's new government was met with criticism from the country's leftist parties, including the uMkhonto weSizwe (MK) party, a new grouping formed a few months ahead of the poll by the country's former president Jacob Zuma, 82.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The MK party came out of nowhere to win more than 14 percent of votes nationwide in the tense poll and now well be the country's official opposition after refusing to join the ANC's broad coalition.</p>

<p>Along with the leftist firebrand party the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), it shunned the ANC's broad coalition with the DA as a "white-led unholy alliance".&nbsp;</p>

<p>The ANC had previously accused the DA of making "outrageous demands" for key cabinet positions in documents leaked to the press following weeks of closed-doors negotiations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ramaphosa has called for the opening of the new parliament on July 18 to address MPs and outline guidelines of how his new coalition government, involving 11 parties, will work.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Here's how the second round of France's parliamentary election on July 7 will work and the possible scenarios after exit polls showed Marine Le Pen's far-right National Rally (RN) party had won Sunday's first round.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here's how the second round of France's parliamentary election on July 7 will work and the possible scenarios after exit polls showed Marine Le Pen's far-right National Rally (RN) party had won Sunday's first round.</p>

<p>HOW DOES IT WORK?</p>

<p>Elections for the 577 seats in France's National Assembly are a two-round process.</p>

<p>In constituencies where no candidate won outright in the first round, the top two candidates, as well as any candidate with more than 12.5% of the total number of registered voters in that constituency, move to a second round.</p>

<p>Whoever gets the most votes in the second round wins the seat.</p>

<p>The high turnout on Sunday means some 300 constituencies are now facing potential three-way run-offs which, in theory, favour the RN.</p>

<p>To prevent these three-way run-offs and block the RN, France's centre-right and centre-left politicians have long practiced what they call a "republican front," whereby the third-placed candidate drops out of the race and urges voters to rally behind the second-placed candidate.</p>

<p>All candidates through to the run-off have until Tuesday evening to decide whether to stand down or run the second round.</p>

<p>HOW IS IT LOOKING THIS TIME?</p>

<p>Many political leaders gave guidance to candidates and voters on Sunday evening.</p>

<p>President Emmanuel Macron urged a "wide-ranging rally behind republican and democratic" candidates for the second round, effectively guiding against both the far-right Nationaly Rally and the hard-left France Unbowed (LFI) party.</p>

<p>His former Prime Minister, Edouard Philippe, explicity called on the candidates from his party to drop out if they were in third position and rally behind candidates from the centre-left to the centre-right, excluding the RN and LFI.</p>

<p>On the left, the Socialist and LFI leaders also called on their third-placed candidates to drop out to block the RN.</p>

<p>The conservative Republicans party, which split ahead of the vote with a small number of its lawmakers joining forces with the RN, gave no guidance.</p>

<p>WHAT WILL HAPPEN NOW?</p>

<p>The effectiveness of the "republican front" has weakened over the years, and many voters no longer heed the advice of party leaders.</p>

<p>It is also possible that candidates will refuse to drop out despite guidance from political HQs in Paris.</p>

<p>But talks over the next 48 hours will be crucial and could swing the results significantly, potentially deciding whether the RN reaches an outright majority in parliament or not.</p>

<p>That makes the result of the second round extraordinarily hard to predict. Even pollsters have urged caution on their own seat projections.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Emmanuel Macron has taken many risks in a political career marked by countless crises but his decision to call snap elections may be one too many, marring his legacy and ushering in an era of extremes.</p>

<p>The tremors from Macron dissolving the National Assembly after his centrist party suffered a drubbing in European polls remain strong, with even figures close to the president acknowledging unease over the political turmoil.</p>

<p>The far-right National Rally (RN) on Sunday won the first round of legislative elections.</p>

<p>Next week's second-round results on July 7 could give the party of Macron's longtime rival Marine Le Pen the post of prime minister for the first time, forcing a tense "cohabitation".</p>

<p>Macron's popularity has sunk to the extent that allies suggested he take a back seat in the campaign, with Prime Minister Gabriel Attal leading the way.</p>

<p>For one of Macron's most loyal supporters, some of the resentment stems from his unexpected rise to the presidency.</p>

<p>"There's a desire for revenge on the part of politicians who resent his success," said Francois Patriat, head of the pro-Macron deputies in the upper house Senate.</p>

<p>Always defiant, Macron insisted in a statement as the first results were published on "the importance of this vote for all our compatriots and the desire to clarify the political situation".</p>

<h2>'Hopeless optimist'</h2>

<p>Born in Amiens to two doctors, Macron met his future wife Brigitte when she was his teacher and 25 years his senior.</p>

<p>"He fell in love with his drama teacher when he was 16, and he said he was going to marry her, and then he married her. That's pretty strong stuff," said a former classmate from the elite graduate school ENA.</p>

<p>With that same self-confidence, he quit the government of former president Francois Hollande in August 2016 to prepare his run for the presidency, a risky move at the time.</p>

<p>He went on to create En Marche (On the Move), a political movement with the same initials as its leader and won the presidential election in 2017 at the age of 39.</p>

<p>Calling himself a "hopeless optimist," Macron later said he was able to break through "because France was unhappy and worried".&nbsp;</p>

<p>Optimism over the former Rothschild investment banker, who once promoted "Revolution" in his book, quickly soured over his economic policies once in office.</p>

<p>The former economy minister under a Socialist government earned the reputation as "president of the rich" after announcing early in his tenure that he would abolish a tax on high earners.</p>

<p>Then, last year, his move to raise the retirement age from 62 to 64 sparked mass protests and reinforced the perception that Macron is out of touch with public opinion.</p>

<p>"There are a lot of people who think I'm haughty," he said. Early quips haunted him, including one when he said the unemployed only needed to "cross the street" to find a job.</p>

<p>The now 46-year-old is convinced that his economic track record speaks for itself, with France considered Europe's most attractive country for foreign investment and an end to mass unemployment.</p>

<p>But for many, Macron's promise of centrism has not withstood pressure from a wave of domestic and international crises -- or from the far right.</p>

<h2>'Lack of humility'</h2>

<p>The anti-government "yellow vest" movement, the Covid-19 pandemic, and the war in Ukraine are just a few of the challenges Macron has faced during his tenure.</p>

<p>Even as his support buckles at home, Macron has remained a key voice in European politics.</p>

<p>"We shouldn't quibble. He's the great European of his time," said Franco-German ecologist Daniel Cohn-Bendit, while adding that Macron's problem was that he was "convinced of being right".</p>

<p>Macron aligned with allies offering support to Ukraine after Russia's 2022 invasion, but he irritated many by continuing to engage with Russian President Vladimir Putin.</p>

<p>Two years later however, some criticise him for his hawkish stance. Macron refuses to rule out sending troops to Ukraine, a move criticised by other Western countries as unnecessarily inflammatory.</p>

<p>The late Gerard Collomb, former mayor of Lyon, was more direct in his criticism, calling out Macron's "hubris" and a "lack of humility" in the government.</p>

<p>The perception that Macron is increasingly isolated is part of the problem, said one former advisor.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"He has no grassroots network... the people around him are the same, they don't express the mood of the times," they added.</p>

<p>While the first lady is seen as a moderating figure, Macron has shifted rightward, with some accusing the president of opportunism.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>'Shifting opinion'</h2>

<p>On the evening of his 2017 victory, Macron pledged in front of the Louvre museum to do "everything" in his power to ensure the French "no longer have any reason to vote for the extremes".</p>

<p>For many, though, the young centrist whom they voted for has shifted further and further right, opening the door for other extremes to take hold.</p>

<p>The same man who drew inspiration from an anti-capitalist party slogan to win re-election in 2022 later adopted the words of extreme right-wing figure Eric Zemmour "so that France remains France".&nbsp;</p>

<p>For Le Pen, who senses a chance to take the presidency in 2027, Macron has "a plasticity, an incredible self-confidence which is both his strength and his weakness".</p>

<p>A former special advisor sees that plasticity differently.</p>

<p>"He's turning his back on ... 2017 and humanist values," said Philippe Grangeon. "There is no right-wing turn... the president is adapting to shifting opinion."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Macron dismisses these criticisms, saying he ultimately relies on himself. "You make the toughest decisions on your own," he said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Marine Le Pen's far-right National Rally (RN) party emerged ahead in the first round of France's parliamentary elections on Sunday, exit polls showed, but the unpredictable final result will depend on days of horsetrading before next week's run-off.</p>

<p>The RN was seen winning around 34% of the vote, exit polls from Ipsos, Ifop, OpinionWay and Elabe showed.</p>

<p>That was ahead of leftist and centrist rivals, including President Emmanuel Macron's Together alliance, whose bloc was seen winning 20.5%-23%. The New Popular Front, a hastily assembled left-wing coalition, was projected to win around 29% of the vote, the exit polls showed.</p>

<p>The results from the high-turnout vote, which were in line with polls ahead of the election, provided little clarity on whether the anti-immigrant, eurosceptic RN will be able to form a government alongside the pro-EU Macron.</p>

<p>A week of political bargaining now lies ahead of the July 7 run-off. The final result will depend on how parties decide to join forces in each of France's 577 constituencies for the second round. In the past, France's centre-right and centre-left parties have teamed up to keep the RN from taking power, but that dynamic, called the "republican front" in France, is less certain than ever.</p>

<p>The French president's decision this month to call snap elections plunged his country into political uncertainty, sent shockwaves around Europe and prompted a sell-off of French assets on financial markets.</p>

<p>Participation in Sunday's vote was high, underlining how France's rumbling political crisis has energised the electorate.</p>

<p>By 1500 GMT, turnout was nearly 60%, compared with 39.42% two years ago - the highest comparable turnout figures since the 1986 legislative vote, Ipsos France's research director Mathieu Gallard said.</p>

<p>A longtime pariah, the RN is now closer to power than it has ever been. Le Pen has sought to detoxify a party known for racism and antisemitism, a tactic that has worked amid voter anger at Macron, the high cost of living and growing concerns over immigration.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A fired-up Joe Biden came out swinging Friday as he tried to make up for a disastrous debate performance against Donald Trump, insisting he was the right man to win November's US presidential election.</p>

<p>Biden's appearance at a campaign rally in the battleground state of North Carolina came amid rumblings in his alarmed Democratic Party about replacing the 81-year-old as their nominee -- and shortly before the nation's most influential newspaper urged him to step aside.</p>

<p>"I don't walk as easy as I used to. I don't speak as smoothly as I used to. I don't debate as well as I used to," Biden admitted to supporters in unusually confessional remarks.</p>

<p>"But I know how to tell the truth. I know how to do this job," he said to huge cheers, vowing "when you get knocked down, you get back up."</p>

<p>Biden's team was in damage-control mode after Thursday's debate when he often hesitated, tripped over words and lost his train of thought -- exacerbating fears about his ability to serve another term.</p>

<p>He had hoped to allay qualms about his advanced age, and to expose Trump as a habitual liar.</p>

<p>But the president failed to counter his bombastic rival, who offered up a largely unchallenged reel of false or misleading statements about everything from the economy to immigration.</p>

<p>On Friday, Biden delivered the lines Democrats wished they had heard in the televised debate.</p>

<p>"Did you see Trump last night? My guess is he set -- and I mean this sincerely -- a new record for the most lies told in a single debate," Biden said.</p>

<p>"Donald Trump is a genuine threat to this nation. He's a threat to our freedom. He's a threat to our democracy. He's literally a threat for everything America stands for."</p>

<p>Trump also returned to the campaign trail Friday, speaking at a rally in Virginia and launching his familiar attacks on Biden in a rambling speech.</p>

<p>"It's not his age, it's his competence," Trump said.</p>

<p>"The question every voter should be asking themselves today is not whether Joe Biden can survive a 90-minute debate performance, but whether America can survive four more years of crooked Joe Biden."</p>

<h3><strong>A new Democrat?</strong></h3>

<p>Trump addressed the chances of Biden being replaced by another candidate, saying "I don't really believe that because he does better in polls than any of the (other) Democrats."</p>

<p>So far, no senior Democratic figure has publicly called on Biden to withdraw, with most toeing a party line about sticking with the existing ticket.</p>

<p>"I will never turn my back on President Biden," California Governor Gavin Newsom, who has figured prominently on lists of possible replacement candidates, said immediately after the debate.</p>

<p>Forcing a change in the ticket would be politically fraught, and Biden would have to decide himself to withdraw to make way for another nominee before the party convention next month.</p>

<p>Biden overwhelmingly won the primary votes, and the party's 3,900 delegates heading to the convention in Chicago are beholden to him.</p>

<p>If he exits, the delegates would have to find a replacement.</p>

<p>"Bad debate nights happen," Biden's former boss, Barack Obama, wrote on X.</p>

<p>But the election is "still a choice between someone who has fought for ordinary folks his entire life and someone who only cares about himself."</p>

<p>A logical -- but not automatic -- candidate to take Biden's place would be his vice president, Kamala Harris, who also loyally defended his debate performance.</p>

<p>The show of Democratic loyalty and Biden's defiance in North Carolina were not enough for The New York Times, however.</p>

<p>The daily newspaper slammed Biden's campaign as a "reckless gamble" in the face of the threat posed by Trump, with its editorial board -- which is separate from the newsroom -- calling for the president to stand aside.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The "greatest public service Mr. Biden can now perform is to announce that he will not continue to run for re-election," it said.</p>

<p>Many election bettors, too, abandoned Biden, preferring to bet on Trump or other Democratic leaders.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Before the debate, bettors on the platform Smarkets were giving Biden a 35 percent chance of winning in November, but on Friday that figure dropped to below 20 percent.</p>

<p>A second debate is scheduled for September 10.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Much of the southeast Caribbean was on alert Sunday as Beryl strengthened into the first hurricane of the 2024 Atlantic season, with forecasters warning of an "extremely dangerous" Category 4 storm.</p>

<p>The US National Hurricane Center (NHC) said Beryl -- currently churning in the Atlantic Ocean about 465 miles (750 kilometers) east of Barbados -- was expected to bring "life-threatening winds and storm surge" when it reaches the Windward Islands early Monday.</p>

<p>Warning the storm is "continuing to rapidly intensify," the NHC forecast it would become an "extremely dangerous Category 4 hurricane" by the time it hit Caribbean communities.</p>

<p>Barbados, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, and Grenada were all under hurricane warnings, while tropical storm warnings or watches were in effect for Martinique, Tobago and Dominica, the NHC said in its latest advisory.</p>

<p>Cars were seen lined up at gas stations Saturday in the Barbadian capital Bridgetown, while supermarkets and grocery stores were crowded with shoppers buying food, water and other supplies. Some households were already boarding up their properties.</p>

<p>A Category 3 or higher on the Saffir-Simpson scale is considered a major hurricane, and a Category 4 storm packs sustained winds of at least 130 miles per hour (209 kilometers per hour).</p>

<p>The NHC said that by around 5:00 am (0900 GMT) Sunday, Beryl's maximum sustained winds had increased to nearly 100 mph, with higher gusts.</p>

<p>Such a powerful storm forming this early in the Atlantic hurricane season -- which runs from early June to late November -- is extremely rare, experts said.</p>

<p>"Only five major (Category 3+) hurricanes have been recorded in the Atlantic before the first week of July. Beryl would be the sixth and earliest this far east in the tropical Atlantic," hurricane expert Michael Lowry posted on social media platform X.</p>

<p>"Hurricane conditions are expected in the hurricane warning area beginning early on Monday," the NHC said, warning of heavy rain, flooding and storm surge that could raise water levels as much as nine feet (2.7 meters) above normal.</p>

<p>"Devastating wind damage is expected where the eyewall of Beryl moves through portions of the Windward Islands," the NHC said, indicating wind speeds in some locations could be 30 percent stronger than those listed in their advisory.</p>

<p>The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said in late May that it expects this year to be an "extraordinary" hurricane season, with up to seven storms of Category 3 or higher.</p>

<p>The agency cited warm Atlantic ocean temperatures and conditions related to the weather phenomenon La Nina in the Pacific for the expected increase in storms.</p>

<p>Extreme weather events including hurricanes have become more frequent and more devastating in recent years as a result of climate change.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Security experts said CrowdStrike's routine update of its widely used cybersecurity software, which caused clients' computer systems to crash globally on Friday, apparently did not undergo adequate quality checks before it was deployed.</p>

<p>The latest version of its Falcon sensor software was meant to make CrowdStrike clients' systems more secure against hacking by updating the threats it defends against. But faulty code in the update files resulted in one of the most widespread tech outages in recent years for companies using Microsoft's Windows operating system.</p>

<p>Global banks, airlines, hospitals and government offices were disrupted. CrowdStrike released information to fix affected systems, but experts said getting them back online would take time as it required manually weeding out the flawed code.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"What it looks like is, potentially, the vetting or the sandboxing they do when they look at code, maybe somehow this file was not included in that or slipped through," said Steve Cobb, chief security officer at Security Scorecard, which also had some systems impacted by the issue.</p>

<p>Problems came to light quickly after the update was rolled out on Friday, and users posted pictures on social media of computers with blue screens displaying error messages. These are known in the industry as "blue screens of death."</p>

<p>Patrick Wardle, a security researcher who specialises in studying threats against operating systems, said his analysis identified the code responsible for the outage.</p>

<p>The update's problem was "in a file that contains either configuration information or signatures," he said. Such signatures are code that detects specific types of malicious code or malware.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"It's very common that security products update their signatures, like once a day... because they're continually monitoring for new malware and because they want to make sure that their customers are protected from the latest threats," he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The frequency of updates "is probably the reason why (CrowdStrike) didn't test it as much," he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It's unclear how that faulty code got into the update and why it wasn't detected before being released to customers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Ideally, this would have been rolled out to a limited pool first," said John Hammond, principal security researcher at Huntress Labs. "That is a safer approach to avoid a big mess like this."</p>

<p>Other security companies have had similar episodes in the past. McAfee's buggy antivirus update in 2010 stalled hundreds of thousands of computers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But the global impact of this outage reflects CrowdStrike's dominance. Over half of Fortune 500 companies and many government bodies such as the top U.S. cybersecurity agency itself, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, use the company's software.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US Vice President Kamala Harris will headline a fundraiser in Massachusetts on Saturday as President Joe Biden faces continued pressure from fellow Democrats and big money donors to end his floundering campaign.</p>

<p>Biden and top aides on Friday vowed to continue with the campaign, even as major donors signaled they were unwilling to open their checkbooks unless the 81-year-old president stepped aside.</p>

<p>The crisis of confidence in Biden's ability to win the Nov. 5 election has placed a huge spotlight on Harris, widely believed to be the most likely replacement if he steps down.</p>

<p>Her fundraising events, including the one on Saturday in Provincetown, Massachusetts, are getting added interest from donors who want to signal they are willing to coalesce around her potential bid for the White House, according to three Democratic fundraisers.</p>

<p>The fundraiser, expected to fetch $2 million, is being hosted by celebrity wedding planner Bryan Rafanelli and is expected to draw some 800 people, according to a source familiar with the planning.</p>

<p>Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg is expected to speak at the event, with celebrities and singers such as Jennifer Coolidge, Billy Porter and Darren Criss among the guests, the source said.</p>

<p>Thirty-five congressional Democrats, representing more than 10% of the party's members in Congress, have now publicly called on Biden, who is isolating at his Delaware home with a case of COVID-19, to drop out following a disastrous debate last month against Republican former President Donald Trump that raised questions about the incumbent's ability to win the election or carry out his duties for another four years.</p>

<p>Biden's doctor on Saturday said the president still has mild COVID-19 symptoms, such as a cough and hoarse voice, but his vital signs are normal and he continues to perform his duties.</p>

<p>Democratic former President Bill Clinton and former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton have privately been supportive of Biden's decision to stay in the race and have been actively encouraging donors to stay with him, NBC News reported on Saturday, citing two sources familiar with the matter.</p>

<p>Separately, US Representative Mark Takano of California on Saturday became the latest Democratic congressman to call on Biden to step aside as a presidential candidate.</p>

<h3><strong>More Fundraisers Scheduled</strong></h3>

<p>Biden's campaign hoped to raise some $50 million in big-dollar donations in July for the Biden Victory Fund but was on track for less than half that figure as of Friday, according to two sources familiar with the fundraising efforts.</p>

<p>The campaign called reports of a July fundraising slump overstated, noting that it anticipated a drop-off in large donations due to vacations. It said the campaign still has 10 fundraisers on the schedule this month.</p>

<p>Harris assured major Democratic donors on Friday that the party would prevail in the presidential election as more lawmakers called for Biden to stand down.</p>

<p>"We are going to win this election," she said on a call arranged on short notice to calm donors, according to a person on the call. "We know which candidate in this election puts the American people first: Our president, Joe Biden."</p>

<p>Harris attended the call "at the direct request of senior advisers to the president," one of the people said, an account confirmed by another person familiar with the matter.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli forces pounded several areas across the Gaza Strip on Saturday, killing at least 39 Palestinians, according to health officials, as tanks advanced deeper into western and northern Rafah.</p>

<p>Among those killed on Saturday were local journalist Mohammad Abu Jasser, his wife and two children in an Israeli strike on their home in the northern Gaza Strip, a medic said.</p>

<p>Gaza's Hamas-run government media office said Abu Jasser's death raised to 161 the number of Palestinian media personnel killed by Israeli fire since Oct 7.</p>

<p>Just before midnight, an Israeli air strike on an encampment housing displaced Palestinian families killed at least 10 people, medics and Hamas media said.</p>

<p>In Al-Nuseirat camp in the central Gaza Strip, an Israeli air strike on a house on Saturday killed three people and wounded eight others, medics said.</p>

<p>Earlier in the day an Israeli missile struck a multi-floor building in the camp, and wounded several people, including two local journalists, rescue workers said.</p>

<p>In Rafah, where Israel said it aimed to dismantle the last battalions of Hamas' armed wing, residents said tanks advanced deeper into northern areas of the city and took control of a hilltop in the west, amid fierce gun battles with Hamas-led fighters.</p>

<p>The army said troops continued operations in Rafah, eliminating many gunmen over the past day in the area of Tel Al-Sultan on the western side of the city. In central Gaza, the military said it conducted raids on Hamas' infrastructure.</p>

<p>The military also said it hit a structure used by Palestinian groups in Deir Al-Balah in central Gaza Strip, saying gunmen were operating from a humanitarian area, and accused Gaza operatives of exploiting civilian structures and population for military purposes, an allegation Hamas and other groups reject as false to justify such attacks.</p>

<p>A ceasefire effort led by Qatar and Egypt and backed by the United States has so far failed due to disputes between the combatants, who blame each other for the impasse.</p>

<p>Israel vowed to eradicate Hamas after its fighters killed 1,200 people and took more than 250 hostage in an Oct. 7 attack, according to Israeli tallies. At least 38,919 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's retaliatory offensive since then, Gaza health authorities say.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, Israel said it had eliminated half the leadership of Hamas' military wing and killed or captured about 14,000 fighters since the start of the war.</p>

<p>Israel says 326 of its soldiers have been killed in Gaza.</p>

<p>Hamas does not release casualty figures and said Israel exaggerates its reports to give the impression of a "fake victory".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump's former physician said Saturday that the Republican presidential candidate sustained a two-centimeter (almost one inch) gunshot wound during last week's attempted assassination, but that his ear is starting to heal.</p>

<p>The memo from former White House physician Ronny Jackson, now a hardline right-wing lawmaker from Texas, is one of the first detailed accounts of the injury Trump sustained when a young gunman opened fire at a rally in Pennsylvania one week ago, killing one bystander and wounding two others.</p>

<p>"The bullet passed, coming less than a quarter of an inch from entering his head, and struck the top of his right ear," wrote Jackson, who said he flew to see Trump in New Jersey late on the evening of the rally, and had been treating his ear ever since.</p>

<p>"The bullet track produced a 2cm wide wound that extended down to the cartilaginous surface of the ear. There was initially significant bleeding, following by a marked swelling of the entire upper ear," he continued.</p>

<p>The swelling has since gone down, and the wound "is beginning to granulate and heal properly," he wrote in the memo, published by Trump on his Truth Social network.</p>

<p>There is still some bleeding requiring a bandage, but "given the broad and blunt nature of the wound itself, no sutures were required," Jackson wrote.</p>

<p>Trump also underwent a CT scan of his head as he was treated for the wound by doctors at the hospital in Butler, Pennsylvania, he said.</p>

<p>"He will have further evaluations, including a comprehensive hearing exam, as needed," Jackson said.</p>

<p>Jackson, who retired from the Navy as a rear admiral last year, was first appointed to the White House medical unit under former president George W. Bush, then became the president's doctor in 2013, under Barack Obama.</p>

<p>But he gained national fame after effusively praising Trump's health and "great genes" in 2018, declaring: "I told the president that if he had a healthier diet over the last 20 years, he might live to be 200 years old."</p>

<p>Soon after, Trump nominated him to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs, but Jackson withdrew his name from consideration following allegations he had improperly handed out drugs and was sometimes drunk at work.</p>

<p>During his campaign for Congress, Jackson positioned himself as a close Trump supporter, endorsing the narrative that Obama had "weaponized" the government to spy on Trump.</p>

<p>He also broke ranks with public health officials on the coronavirus, saying that mask wearing should be a "personal choice," and he questioned Joe Biden's cognitive capacity to run for president.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli strikes late on Saturday targeted a depot storing ammunition belonging to Lebanese armed group Hezbollah in southern Lebanon, three security sources told Reuters.</p>

<p>The strikes on the town of Adloun, about 40 km (25 miles) north of Lebanon's border with Israel, set off a string of loud explosions heard by witnesses across the south of Lebanon.</p>

<p>At least four civilians in Adloun were wounded in the strikes, a medical source and a security source told Reuters.</p>

<p>The strikes on South Lebanon were on the same day that Israeli fighter jets struck Houthi military targets in the area of Yemen's port city of Hodeidah, which Hezbollah said will mark a "new and dangerous phase" in the region.</p>

<p>Israel launched the strikes on Yemen a day after a drone launched by the Iranian-backed Houthis hit Israel's economic hub Tel Aviv</p>

<p>Israel and Hezbollah have been trading fire since Hezbollah announced a "support front" with Palestinians shortly after its ally Hamas attacked southern Israeli border communities on Oct. 7, triggering Israel's military offensive in Gaza.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Flash floods in northern and southwest China have killed at least 20 people and left dozens missing, state media said Saturday, after a week of deadly downpours across the country.</p>

<p>Several vehicles in northwestern Shaanxi province plunged into a swollen river late Friday after a bridge collapsed, with at least 12 people killed and over 30 missing, state news agency Xinhua reported.</p>

<p>Initial investigations indicated that 17 cars and eight trucks had fallen into the river in the city of Shangluo, Xinhua said.</p>

<p>Images on state television showed a partially submerged section of the bridge with the river rushing over it.</p>

<p>One witness told local media that he had approached the bridge but that other drivers started "yelling at me to brake and stop the car".</p>

<p>"A truck in front of me didn't stop" and plunged into the water, the witness, surnamed Meng, said.</p>

<p>Chinese President Xi Jinping has urged "all-out rescue and relief efforts" to find those still missing, Xinhua said.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in southwestern Sichuan province more than 30 people were reported missing Saturday after a violent thunderstorm caused flash flooding overnight in the town of Ya'an, according to Xinhua.</p>

<p>Eight bodies had been recovered as of Saturday evening, while four people were rescued without serious injuries, it added.</p>

<p>On Friday, state media had reported at least five people dead and eight missing after the rains sparked flooding and mudslides in Shaanxi's Baoji city.</p>

<p>State television broadcast images of neighbourhoods completely flooded by muddy water, with excavators and residents attempting to clear the damage.</p>

<h3><strong>Extreme weather</strong></h3>

<p>The semi-desert province of Gansu, which neighbours Shaanxi, and Henan in central China were also hit by heavy rains this week.</p>

<p>In Henan's Nanyang city, the equivalent of a year's worth of rain fell at the start of the week, CCTV said.</p>

<p>And in Sichuan province, two people were reported killed and seven others missing Friday after heavy rain triggered landslides, Xinhua said.</p>

<p>China is enduring a summer of extreme weather, with heavy rains across the east and south coming as much of the north has sweltered under successive heatwaves.</p>

<p>Climate change, which scientists say is exacerbated by greenhouse gas emissions, is making such extreme weather phenomena more frequent and more intense.</p>

<p>In May, a highway in southern China collapsed after days of rain, leaving 48 dead.</p>

<p>This month, a tornado passed through a town in eastern China, killing one, injuring 79 and causing major damage.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hezbollah and its Palestinian ally Hamas said they fired rockets and explosive-laden drones at Israeli positions Saturday to avenge strikes on civilians in Lebanon and Gaza fatalities.</p>

<p>Hezbollah has traded near-daily fire with Israeli forces in support of Hamas since the Palestinian group's October 7 attack on southern Israel triggered war in the Gaza Strip.</p>

<p>Earlier Saturday, Lebanon's state-run National News Agency said Syrian nationals, including children, had been injured after an "enemy drone targeted an empty four-wheel drive" near their tent, near the border.</p>

<p>Doctor Mouenes Kalakesh who heads the Marjayoun government hospital said a woman and her three children, two of them minors, had been admitted for shrapnel injuries after the strike outside Burj al-Muluk.</p>

<p>Among them was an 11-year-old boy in critical condition after he sustained shrapnel injuries and a head wound, Kalakesh told AFP.</p>

<p>Hezbollah said it launched "dozens of Katyusha rockets" on Dafna, an area in Israel's north that the group said it was targeting for the first time, "in response to the attack on civilians".</p>

<p>Hamas's armed wing, the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades, said they also fired a rocket salvo from south Lebanon towards an Israeli military position in the Upper Galilee "in response to the Zionist massacres against civilians in the Gaza Strip".</p>

<p>Later on Saturday, the Iran-backed Hezbollah said it also had launched "explosive-laden drones" targeting "artillery and missile positions" and Israeli troops at a site in the Golan Heights as well as Iron Dome platforms.</p>

<p>Before the drone attack, the Israeli army said a total of 45 "projectiles" had been fired from Lebanon Saturday afternoon, towards the occupied Golan Heights and the Galilee, reporting no casualties.</p>

<p>The army said it struck "the launcher... in southern Lebanon from which the projectiles were launched toward the Golan Heights," also targeting "an additional Hezbollah launcher".</p>

<p>Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah had warned his Iran-backed group would hit new targets in Israel if more civilians were killed in Israeli strikes.</p>

<p>Israeli strikes on Thursday killed at least five people in Lebanon, including the commander of a Hamas-allied group, a security source and operatives groups said.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, Lebanese official media said Israeli strikes on south Lebanon killed five Syrians, three of them children, with Hezbollah announcing rocket fire at Israel in retaliation.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The U.S. criticized "the breadth" of the top U.N. court's opinion that Israel's occupation of Palestinian territories is illegal, with Washington saying it would complicate efforts to resolve the conflict.</p>

<p>"We have been clear that Israel's program of government support for settlements is both inconsistent with international law and obstructs the cause of peace," a U.S. State Department spokesperson said on Saturday in an email.</p>

<p>"However, we are concerned that the breadth of the court's opinion will complicate efforts to resolve the conflict," the State Department added.</p>

<p>The International Court of Justice, or the World Court, said on Friday that Israel's occupation of Palestinian territories and settlements was illegal and should be ended as soon as possible, delivering its strongest findings to date on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p>

<p>The State Department said the ICJ opinion that Israel must withdraw as soon as possible from the Palestinian territories was "inconsistent with the established framework" for resolving the conflict.</p>

<p>Washington said that framework took into account Israel's security needs, which it says were highlighted by the Oct. 7 attacks on Israel by Palestinian Islamist group Hamas. Those attacks killed 1,200, with around 250 people taken as hostages, according to Israeli tallies.</p>

<h3><strong>Two-State Solution</strong></h3>

<p>The advisory opinion by ICJ judges is not binding but carries weight under international law and may weaken support for Israel.</p>

<p>The State Department said the way forward was through direct negotiations.</p>

<p>"Israeli settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, and the regime associated with them, have been established and are being maintained in violation of international law," ICJ President Nawaf Salam said on Friday while reading the findings of a 15-judge panel.</p>

<p>The court said Israel's obligations include paying restitution for harm and "the evacuation of all settlers from existing settlements".</p>

<p>Israel rejected the opinion and said a political settlement can only be reached through negotiations. The office of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas welcomed the opinion, which it called historic.</p>

<p>The State Department said it "strongly discourages" parties from using the ICJ opinion "as a pretext for further unilateral actions that deepen divisions or for supplanting a negotiated two-state solution."</p>

<p>The ICJ case stems from a 2022 request for a legal opinion from the United Nations General Assembly. It predates Israel's war in Gaza, which began after the Oct. 7 attacks and has killed almost 39,000, according to the health ministry in Gaza, which has been under Hamas rule, while causing a hunger crisis, displacing Gaza's nearly entire 2.3 million people and spurring genocide allegations that Israel denies.</p>

<p>The ICJ opinion said the U.N. Security Council, the General Assembly and all states have an obligation not to recognize the occupation as legal nor "render aid or assistance" toward maintaining Israel's presence in the Palestinian territories.</p>

<p>Israel captured the West Bank, Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem - which the Palestinians want for a state - in the Six-Day War in 1967 and has since built and expanded settlements in the West Bank.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Planes were gradually taking off again Saturday after global airlines, banks and media were thrown into turmoil by one of the biggest IT crashes in recent years, caused by an update to an antivirus program.</p>

<p>Passenger crowds had swelled at airports on Friday as dozens of flights were cancelled after an update to a program operating on Microsoft Windows crashed systems worldwide.</p>

<p>By Saturday, officials said the situation had returned virtually to normal in airports across Germany and France, as Paris prepared to welcome millions for the Olympic Games starting on Friday.</p>

<p>Multiple US airlines and airports across Asia said they had resumed operations, with check-in services restored in Hong Kong, South Korea and Thailand, and mostly back to normal in India, Indonesia and at Singapore's Changi Airport as of Saturday afternoon.</p>

<h3><strong>CrowdStrike apologises</strong></h3>

<p>Microsoft estimated Saturday that 8.5 million Windows devices were affected in the global IT crash, adding that the number amounted to less than one percent of all Windows machines.</p>

<p>"While the percentage was small, the broad economic and societal impacts reflect the use of CrowdStrike by enterprises that run many critical services", it said.</p>

<p>Microsoft said the issue began at 1900 GMT on Thursday, affecting Windows users running the CrowdStrike Falcon cybersecurity software.</p>

<p>In a Saturday blog post, CrowdStrike said it had released an update on Thursday night that caused a system crash and the infamous "blue screen of death" fatal error message.</p>

<p>CrowdStrike said it had rolled out a fix for the problem, and the company's boss, George Kurtz, told US news channel CNBC he wanted to "personally apologise to every organisation, every group and every person who has been impacted".</p>

<p>The company also said it could take a few days for a full return to normal.</p>

<p>Reports from the Netherlands and Britain suggested health services might have been affected by the disruption, meaning the full impact might not yet be known.</p>

<p>Media companies were also hit, with Britain's Sky News saying the glitch had ended its Friday morning news broadcasts, and Australia's ABC similarly reporting major difficulties.</p>

<p>Australian, British and German authorities warned of an increase in scam and phishing attempts following the outage, including people offering to help reboot computers and asking for personal information or credit card details.</p>

<p>Banks in Kenya and Ukraine reported issues with their digital services, while some mobile phone carriers were disrupted and customer services in a number of companies went down.</p>

<p>"The scale of this outage is unprecedented, and will no doubt go down in history," said Junade Ali of Britain's Institution of Engineering and Technology, adding that the last incident approaching the same scale was in 2017.</p>

<h3><strong>Flight chaos</strong></h3>

<p>While some airports halted all flights, in others airline staff resorted to manual check-ins for passengers, leading to long lines and frustrated travellers.</p>

<p>Thousands of US flights were grounded, although airlines later said they were re-establishing their services and working through the backlog.</p>

<p>A senior US administration official said Friday that "our understanding is that flight operations have resumed across the country, although some congestion remains".</p>

<p>India's largest airline Indigo said Saturday that operations had been "resolved", adding in a statement on X that the process of resuming normal operations would "extend into the weekend".</p>

<p>Low-cost carrier AirAsia said it was still trying to get back online and had been "working around the clock towards recovering its departure control systems".</p>

<p>Chinese state media said Beijing's airports had not been affected.</p>

<h3><strong>Common cause</strong></h3>

<p>Companies were left patching up their systems and trying to assess the damage, even as officials tried to tamp down panic by ruling out foul play.</p>

<p>According to CrowdStrike's Saturday blog, the issue was "not the result of or related to a cyberattack".</p>

<p>Although CrowdStrike had rolled out a fix, many experts questioned the ease of such a process.</p>

<p>"While experienced users can implement the workaround, expecting millions to do so is impractical," said Oli Buckley, a professor at Britain's Loughborough University.</p>

<p>Other experts said the incident should prompt a widespread reconsideration of how reliant societies are on a handful of tech companies.</p>

<p>"We need to be aware that such software can be a common cause of failure for multiple systems at the same time," said John McDermid, a professor at York University in Britain.</p>

<p>He said infrastructure should be designed "to be resilient against such common cause problems".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A global tech outage that was related to a software update by cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike affected nearly 8.5 million Microsoft devices, Microsoft said in a blog post on Saturday.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We currently estimate that CrowdStrike's update affected 8.5 million Windows devices, or less than one percent of all Windows machines," it said in the blog.</p>

<p>A software update by global cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, one of the largest operators in the industry, triggered systems problems that grounded flights, forced broadcasters off air and left customers without access to services such as healthcare or banking.</p>

<p>"While the percentage was small, the broad economic and societal impacts reflect the use of CrowdStrike by enterprises that run many critical services," Microsoft said in its blog post.</p>

<p>CrowdStrike has helped develop a solution that will help Microsoft's Azure infrastructure accelerate a fix, Microsoft said, adding that it was working with Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform, sharing information about the effects Microsoft was seeing across the industry.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The air travel industry was recovering on Saturday from the outage that caused thousands of flights to be cancelled, leaving passengers stranded or grappling with hours of delays as airports and airlines were caught up in the IT outage.</p>

<p>Delta Air Lines, one of the hardest-hit airlines, said that as of 10 a.m EDT (1400 GMT) on Saturday, more than 600 flights had been canceled, adding that additional cancellations were expected.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Expressing concern, Imran Khan's wife Bushra Bibi has alleged that the former Prime Minister's life is in danger in Adiala Jail, citing previous incidents when he was shot at, and reportedly poisoned, The Express Tribune reported.</p>

<p>In an informal conversation with the journalists at the prison on Saturday, she revealed her fears not only regarding Imran Khan's life but also about her own as well.</p>

<p>She also mentioned that the court has not yet responded to their plea for an investigation into the poisoning. Bushra Bibi claimed that Imran Khan was kept in filthy circumstances and fed tainted food when describing the conditions at the jail.</p>

<p>She said that Imran Khan looked malnourished when they met at Attock Jail and that he spent the whole night picking insects out of his hair.</p>

<p>The treatment of political prisoners in contrast to convicted criminals was also condemned by Bushra Bibi. She emphasised that, whereas Imran Khan suffered without even the most basic amenities, other detainees were treated like royalty.</p>

<p>When a journalist questioned Bushra Bibi about claims of adding toilet cleaner to food and her accusations against the authorities, she responded by saying that, the 'claims were true', according to The Express Tribune.</p>

<p>As the meeting came to an end, Bushra Bibi emphasised her and Imran Khan's readiness to take an oath, stating that the charges made against them were fabricated.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Israeli warplanes struck the Houthi-controlled Yemeni port of Hodeida Saturday, a day after a drone attack by the Houthi rebels killed a civilian in Tel Aviv, both sides said.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli warplanes struck the Huthi-controlled Yemeni port of Hodeida Saturday, a day after a drone attack by the Iran-backed rebels killed a civilian in Tel Aviv, both sides said.</p>

<p>The strikes, which triggered a raging fire and plumes of black smoke, are the first claimed by Israel in the Arabian peninsula's poorest country, some 1,800 kilometres (1,100 miles) away, analysts said.</p>

<p>"The blood of Israeli citizens has a price," Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said, adding more operations against the Huthis would follow "if they dare to attack us".</p>

<p>Gallant said the Hodeida strikes were also a warning to other Iran-backed armed groups around the Middle East that have claimed attacks on Israel during the Gaza war.</p>

<p>"The fire that is currently burning in Hodeida, is seen across the Middle East and the significance is clear," he said.</p>

<p>Just hours after Friday's strike in Tel Aviv, Gallant had vowed Israel would retaliate against the Huthis, who control swathes of Yemen, including much of its Red Sea coast.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said "fighter jets struck military targets of the Huthi terrorist regime in the area of Hodeida port in Yemen in response to the hundreds of attacks carried out against the state of Israel in recent months".</p>

<p>The Huthis have previously claimed attacks on Israeli cities including Ashdod, Haifa and Eilat, but Friday's strike on Tel Aviv appears to have been the first to breach Israel's vaunted air defences.</p>

<h3><strong>'Brutal aggression'</strong></h3>

<p>In a statement on social media, top Huthi official Mohammed Abdulsalam reported a "brutal Israel aggression against Yemen."</p>

<p>The attack targeted "fuel storage facilities and a power plant" in Hodeida "to pressure Yemen to stop supporting" Palestinians in the Gaza war, he said.</p>

<p>The Huthi-run health ministry said there were deaths and injuries in the Hodeida strikes, but it did not give a toll.</p>

<p>In a statement carried by the Huthi-run Al Masirah television, it said several people suffered "serious burns".</p>

<p>Footage aired by Al Masirah, which AFP could not independently verify, showed a massive blaze on the seafront, with a large plume of black smoke rising into the sky.</p>

<p>The channel also broadcast images of casualties being treated in hospital, many of them bandaged and lying on stretchers in packed rooms.</p>

<p>A man interviewed by the broadcaster said many of the wounded were port employees.</p>

<p>An AFP correspondent in Hodeida reported hearing several large explosions and seeing smoke over the port.</p>

<p>"The city is dark, people are on the streets, petrol stations are closed and seeing long queues," said a Hodeida resident, who spoke on condition of anonymity citing safety concerns.</p>

<p>Maritime security firm Ambrey said it observed four merchant vessels in the port at the time of the air strike and another eight in the anchorage.</p>

<p>"No damage to merchant vessels has been reported at this time," it said.</p>

<h3><strong>Yemen aid lifeline fears</strong></h3>

<p>The United States, which along with Britain has carried out several rounds of air strikes against the Huthis in an attempt to put an end to their attacks on shipping in the Red Sea, said it played no part in Saturday's strikes.</p>

<p>"The United States was not involved in today's strikes in Yemen, and we did not coordinate or assist Israel with the strikes," a US National Security Council spokesman said.</p>

<p>"We've been in regular and ongoing contact with the Israelis following the strike in Tel Aviv that killed an Israeli civilian on Friday morning. We fully recognise and acknowledge Israel's right to self-defence."</p>

<p>UN chief Antonio Guterres had appealed for "maximum restraint" after the Tel Aviv drone strike to avoid "further escalation in the region".</p>

<p>But Huthi politburo member Mohammed al-Bukhaiti swiftly threatened revenge for the Hodeida strikes.</p>

<p>"The Zionist entity will pay the price for targeting civilian facilities, and we will meet escalation with escalation," he said in a post on social media.</p>

<p>The Huthis' Supreme Political Council vowed the "aggression will not pass without an effective response."</p>

<p>Hodeida port, a critical entry point for imports and international aid for rebel-held areas of Yemen, had remained largely untouched through the decade-long war between the rebels and the internationally recognised government propped up by neighbouring Saudi Arabia.</p>

<p>"Traders now fear that this will exacerbate the already critical food security and humanitarian situation in northern Yemen, as the majority of trade flows through this port," said Mohammed Albasha, senior Middle East analyst for the US-based Navanti Group.</p>

<p>He said the Israeli strikes "would likely be perceived by many Yemenis as an attack on their homeland, which could bolster Huthi recruitment and funding."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[US President Joe Biden hit out at Donald Trump on Saturday for his "dark vision" for the country and said he will resume campaign next week to expose his Republican rival's Project 2025 agenda amidst Democrats' calls for him to quit the race.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden hit out at Donald Trump on Saturday for his "dark vision" for the country and said he will resume campaign next week to expose his Republican rival's Project 2025 agenda amidst Democrats' calls for him to quit the race.</p>

<p>In a thread of 13 posts on X, Biden, 81, said he had the “distinct misfortune of watching” Trump's speech, which he fact-checked and tore down the latter's claims one by one, at times, supporting it by what his government did on that issue late on Friday night local time.</p>

<p>Biden, who tested positive for COVID-19 a few days ago, is in isolation at his home in Delaware. After this week's rest, he is expected to hit the campaign trail next week as he aims to seek re-election.</p>

<p>“I'm stuck at home with COVID, so I had the distinct misfortune of watching Donald Trump's speech to the RNC. What the hell was he talking about?” Biden started with this post on X while poking fun at the keynote speech of the opposition party's presidential nominee for the November 5 election at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee on Thursday.</p>

<p>Biden then added 11 other posts each fact-checking issues, including what Trump, 78, did with COVID-19, his claim about Social Security and Medical, tax cuts, inflation, and Project 2025 agenda where Trump wants “to throw immigrants into mass detention camps.” The post which said, “He praised Hannibal Lecter. Donald, Hannibal Lecter is not real. And he is a cannibal,” almost went viral garnering the most retweets and likes among other posts in the thread.</p>

<p>The thread ended with: “And if you're with me, pitch in to our campaign” and had a poster showing Trump and his running mate J D Vance and a caption: ‘Protect Democracy. Defeat Trump-Vance.' Meanwhile, in a statement issued by his campaign, Biden said: “Donald Trump's dark vision for the future is not who we are as Americans. Together, as a party and as a country, we can and will defeat him at the ballot box.” “I look forward to getting back on the campaign trail next week to continue exposing the threat of Donald Trump's Project 2025 agenda while making the case for my own record and the vision that I have for America: one where we save our democracy, protect our rights and freedoms and create opportunity for everyone,” he said.</p>

<p>“For over 90 minutes, he focused on his own grievances, with no plan to unite us and no plan to make life better for working people,” said the president referring to Trump's speech.</p>

<p>“He avoided mentioning his Project 2025 agenda, but still proudly flaunted the worst of MAGA (Make America Great Again) extremism," Biden said, referring to Trump's mention of immigrants. “Americans know exactly where he wants to take this country.” One of the priorities of Project 2025, published by the Heritage Foundation, is to create a roadmap for the first 180 days of the new Trump administration to quickly reorient every federal agency around its conservative vision. It also aims to recruit and train thousands of people loyal to the conservative movement to fill federal government positions, according to CNN.</p>

<p>The Biden-Harris campaign alleged: “Trump is still the same twice-impeached, 34-time convicted felon consumed by revenge and hell-bent on seeking retribution in a second term.” Days after Biden's disastrous performance against Trump in the first presidential debate, Democrats remained split on whether he can beat the former president in November and as of Friday at least 10 Democrats had joined the chorus calling on him to step back.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Gaza hospital said Saturday it saved a baby boy from his mother's womb after she died from wounds sustained in an Israeli strike.</p>

<p>Ola Adnan Harb al-Kurd, who was nine months pregnant, barely survived a punishing night of missile strikes that rescue services across the Hamas-run territory said killed more than 24 people, including six members of the same family.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But by the time Kurd reached Al-Awda Hospital, she was "almost dead", according to surgeon Akram Hussein.</p>

<p>Doctors were unable to save the mother, but performed an ultrasound that detected the baby's heartbeat.</p>

<p>They quickly staged an emergency cesarean section "and extracted the fetus," the surgeon told AFP.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The newborn was initially in critical condition, but after receiving oxygen and medical attention was stabilised, said Raed al-Saudi, head of the hospital's obstetrics and gynaecology department.</p>

<p>He was placed in an incubator and transferred to Al-Aqsa Hospital in Deir el-Balah.</p>

<p>Kurd was among three women and a child killed by an Israeli missile fired on the Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza, according to a medical official at Al-Awda Hospital. Her husband was also wounded in the strike on the family home.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Israel has not confirmed individual strikes, but a military statement said troops were "conducting targeted raids on terrorist infrastructure sites" in central Gaza.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Israel has stepped up its offensive in several parts of the territory in line with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's order to increase pressure on Hamas following the Palestinian militants' attacks on southern Israel on October 7.&nbsp;</p>

<p>One man was killed in a drone hit while riding a bicycle on a street near the southern city of Khan Yunis, the Palestinian Red Crescent said.</p>

<p>Air strikes on two homes in Gaza City in the north each left six dead, according to the civil defence agency and paramedics.</p>

<p>Israel's military statement said "troops eliminated a number of terrorists in several different encounters" and had launched an operation on the Tal al-Sultan refugee camp near the southern city of Rafah.</p>

<p>The war in Gaza has made childbirth increasingly perilous, with pregnant women facing not only near-daily strikes that hamper access to health facilities, but also widespread food insecurity, degrading sanitary conditions and water scarcity.</p>

<p>The few hospitals that are still working have been stretched to breaking point, according to humanitarian groups.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pre-term deliveries and maternal complications, including eclampsia, haemorrhage and sepsis, have been rising, Doctors Without Borders said this week.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>French authorities have recalled Olympics-branded water bottles for children containing excessive levels of endocrine disruptor Bisphenol A, a week ahead of the Paris Games' opening.</p>

<p>The reusable bottles made by the Vilac company have "levels of Bisphenol A not in line with regulations" on products designed for contact with foods, government website Rappel Conso (Consumer Recall) said Friday.</p>

<p>The white-coloured flasks with beige, blue or red tops are branded with the Olympic rings, the Paris 2024 mascot or the Olympic flame.</p>

<p>People who have bought them should return them to the place of purchase, authorities said.</p>

<p>The bottles were sold in France from late August last year until the beginning of June.</p>

<p>Bisphenol A, once widely used in making food containers, has been banned in France since 2015.</p>

<p>Labelled an endocrine disruptor by France's food safety agency Anses, it is believed to be linked to health problems including breast cancer and infertility.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A former teacher&nbsp;at Saint Mary Magdalen School in Wilmington, Delaware, has been accused of sending explicit photos to a former student.&nbsp;According to the <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/07/19/us-news/catholic-school-teacher-accused-of-sending-sexually-explicit-photos-to-14-year-old/">New York Post, </a></em>Alanis Pinion, a 24-year-old eighth-grade teacher,&nbsp;was arrested on&nbsp;Thursday by the New Castle County Police.</p>

<p>&nbsp;According to the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nccpdnews.com/2024/07/19/detectives-arrest-teacher-distributing-explicit-photographs-alanis-pinion/">New Castle County Police</a>, Pinion regularly communicated with her students on Snapchat and allegedly engaged in inappropriate behaviour by sending explicit images to one of them.</p>

<p>She was charged with sexual solicitation of a child, endangering the welfare of a child, and indecent exposure.&nbsp;Pinion was arraigned and committed to the Baylor Women's Correctional Institution after failing to pay $46,000 cash bail.</p>

<p>A spokesperson for the Saint Mary Magdalen School told <em>NBC10</em>&nbsp;that Pinion was a part-time contractor and is no longer associated with the school.</p>

<p>"Earlier this week, the school was contacted by the New Castle County Police to notify us of an investigation and ultimately an arrest of a former part-time contract employee regarding allegations of an exchange of inappropriate images electronically with a former student," the school wrote.</p>

<p>"The contractor had successfully completed the required background check process prior to her employment. The school, parish and our Diocese officials supported the police as they conducted their investigation. Please be assured that all of us at Saint Mary Magdalen Parish and School, along with our partners at the Diocese of Wilmington, always keep the safety of our children and youth as a primary goal,''&nbsp; the school continued.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Division of Police is worried that there might be other victims who have not yet come forward, according to their statement.&nbsp;Anyone with information about the investigation is urged to reach out to Detective Daniel Watson.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Last month, a special education teacher at an intermediate school in New Jersey was arrested for an alleged sexual relationship with a student, according to authorities.&nbsp;43-year-old&nbsp;Allison Havemann-Niedrach&nbsp;at Freehold Intermediate School was charged with first-degree aggravated sexual assault and endangering the welfare of a child, Monmouth County&nbsp;<a href="https://mcponj.org/2024/06/29/intermediate-school-teacher-charged-with-engaging-in-sexual-relationship-with-student/">Prosecutor Raymond S.

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bangladesh soldiers patrolled the deserted streets of the capital Dhaka on Saturday and set up roadblocks during a curfew meant to quell deadly students-led protests against government job quotas that have killed at least 110 people this week.</p>

<p>Internet and text message services have been suspended since Thursday, cutting the nation off from the rest of the world as police cracked down on protests that have continued despite a ban on public gatherings.</p>

<p>Overseas telephone calls mostly failed to connect while websites of Bangladesh-based media organisations did not update and their social media handles remained inactive.</p>

<p>"To take a country of nearly 170 million people off the Internet is a drastic step, one we haven't seen the likes of since the Egyptian revolution of 2011," said John Heidemann, chief scientist of the networking and cybersecurity division at USC Viterbi's Information Sciences Institute.</p>

<p>In addition to the deaths, the clashes have injured thousands, according to data from hospitals across Bangladesh. The Dhaka Medical College Hospital received 27 dead bodies between 5 p.m. and 7 p.m. (1100-1200 GMT) on Friday.</p>

<p>For five days police have fired tear gas and hurled sound grenades to scatter protesters as demonstrators clashed with security personnel, throwing bricks and igniting vehicles.</p>

<p>The demonstrations - the biggest since Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina was re-elected for a fourth successive term this year - have also been fuelled by high unemployment among young people, who make up nearly a fifth of the South Asian nation's 170 million people.</p>

<p>With the death count climbing and police and other security forces unable to contain the protests, Hasina's government imposed a national curfew and deployed the military.</p>

<p>The curfew was eased for two hours from noon on Saturday to allow people to shop for supplies and complete other chores, television channels reported. It will last until 10 a.m. (0400 GMT) on Sunday, when the government will assess the situation and decide the next course of action, the reports added.</p>

<p>Those venturing out on the streets had their identification cards inspected by army personnel at different check points, TV footage showed. Troops set up roadblocks and bunkers using sandbags across strategic locations of Dhaka, the centre of the anti-quota protests.</p>

<p>The nationwide unrest broke out over student anger against the controversial quotas for government jobs, including 30% for the families of those who fought for independence from Pakistan.</p>

<p>Hasina's government had scrapped the quota system in 2018, but a court reinstated it last month. The state appealed against the reinstatement and the Supreme Court suspended it for a month, pending a hearing on Aug. 7.</p>

<p>In the central Dhaka district of Narsingdi, protesters stormed a jail on Friday, freeing over 850 inmates and setting fire to the facility, TV channels reported, citing police. Scattered incidents of arson were also reported on Saturday in some parts of the country.</p>

<p>Hasina dropped plans to leave on Sunday for diplomatic visits to Spain and Brazil due to the protests, the office of Foreign Minister Hasan Mahmud said.</p>

<p>Many opposition party leaders, activists and student protesters had been arrested, said Tarique Rahman, the exiled acting chairman of the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party. Police arrested Nahid Islam, a leading coordinator of the students' agitation, at 2 a.m. on Saturday, the protesters said in a text message.</p>

<p>Reuters could not independently confirm the arrests.</p>

<p>Neighbouring India said nearly 1,000 Indian students have returned home through various land ports and flights since the violence began.</p>

<p>International rights groups have criticised the internet suspension and actions of security forces. The European Union said it is deeply concerned by the violence and loss of life.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The towering, 11-foot-high behemoth, dubbed "Apex," was excavated just outside present-day Dinosaur, Colorado, in May 2022.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Billionaire investor Ken Griffin, founder and CEO of hedge fund Citadel, has shattered auction records by splurging $44.6 million for a dinosaur skeleton.&nbsp;According to the <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/07/18/us-news/stegosaurus-skeleton-sold-to-citadels-ken-griffin-for-44-6m/">New York Post</a></em>,&nbsp;Mr Griffin purchased the largest and the most intact stegosaurus&nbsp;skeleton at Sotheby's on Wednesday, making it the most valuable fossil ever sold at auction.</p>

<p>Estimated to be 150 million years old, the behemoth dubbed "Apex," was excavated just outside present-day Dinosaur, Colorado, in May 2022 by&nbsp;palaeontologist Jason Cooper. According to Sotheby's, the Apex stegosaurus is the largest ever discovered, standing at an impressive 11 feet (3.3 meters) in height and 27 feet (8.2 meters) in length, with a remarkable 254 out of an estimated 319 bones preserved, making it nearly complete.</p>

<p>Mr Griffin secured the skeleton by outbidding six other participants in an auction that lasted 15 minutes. The skeleton, initially anticipated to sell for around $6 million, was purchased for $44.6 million, 11 times its lower estimate, marking a new record for dinosaur fossils.&nbsp;</p>

<p>''Apex' lived up to its name today, inspiring bidders globally to become the most valuable fossil ever sold at auction. This sale has been years in the making, and at every turn, we have worked closely with Jason Cooper, from the moment of its discovery in Dinosaur, Colorado, to its sale in New York,'' said Cassandra Hatton, Sotheby's global head of science and popular culture in a statement.</p>

<p>According to Forbes, the hedge fund chief is a regular donor to the Republican party and has a net worth of approximately $37.8 billion. He now plans to loan the skeleton to institutions across the United States instead of keeping it for his private collection.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump will hold his first campaign rally on Saturday since he narrowly escaped an assassination attempt one week ago and fresh from his nominating convention where his takeover of the Republican Party was cemented.</p>

<p>Trump will appear in Grand Rapids, in the battleground state of Michigan, along with his new vice presidential pick, Ohio U.S. Senator J.D. Vance. It will be their first campaign event together as the now official Republican presidential ticket.</p>

<p>Republican Party officials said during Trump's nominating convention in Milwaukee this week that his brush with death last Saturday had changed him, and that when he made his acceptance speech on Thursday night he would call for national unity.</p>

<p>While Trump began the address with a call for unity and national healing, much of his speech was his well-known list of grievances and attacks on opponents.</p>

<p>It is unclear what type of a speech Trump will deliver on Saturday, but his diehard supporters typically flock to such events to hear Trump's more traditional inflammatory rhetoric.</p>

<p>Trump and Vance will take the stage in Grand Rapids with the Republican Party unified behind them after this week's nominating convention. In contrast, the Democrats are in turmoil and it is no longer certain that President Joe Biden will be the Democratic nominee facing Trump in the Nov. 5 election.</p>

<p>Biden is facing mounting calls from many elected officials in his own party to step aside as the party's White House candidate and to end his re-election bid, after his poor debate performance against Trump last month.</p>

<p>Biden is trailing in opinion polls and is behind in every swing state against Trump. Many Democrats fear he may have virtually no path to victory and that the party needs a new presidential candidate to take on Trump.</p>

<p>The rally in Grand Rapids will be in an indoor arena, unlike the event in Butler, Pennsylvania last weekend, which was outdoors. At that event, the gunman was able to scale the roof of a building outside the Secret Service perimeter before opening fire on Trump, clipping his ear, killing a rally-goer and wounding several others.</p>

<p>The U.S. Secret Service, which is responsible for protecting Trump, declined to comment on security for the Grand Rapids event. An investigation is under way into the security failures at the Butler rally.</p>

<p>"The Secret Service does not discuss the means and methods used for our protective operations," the agency said in a statement.</p>

<p>Trump gave a detailed account of his narrow brush with death in his convention speech on Thursday, telling the audience that he was only talking to them "by the grace of Almighty God."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

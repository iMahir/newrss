       <description><![CDATA[Israel's killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah has given Iran a serious dilemma -- how to cope with the loss of a crucial ally and still maintain its regional influence.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel's killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah has given Iran a serious dilemma -- how to cope with the loss of a crucial ally and still maintain its regional influence.</p>

<p>Lebanon's Hezbollah group, which has long been armed and financed by Iran, on Saturday confirmed Nasrallah's death after Israel said it had "eliminated" him in an air strike on Beirut's southern suburbs.</p>

<p>His death was a sharp escalation in nearly a year of tit-for-tat cross-border exchanges between Hezbollah and Israel since the Gaza conflict began, and risks plunging the entire region into a wider war.</p>

<p>Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei vowed Nasrallah's death "will not be in vain", and First Vice President Mohammad Reza Aref said it would bring about Israel's "destruction".</p>

<p>Iran also vowed to avenge the killing of Revolutionary Guards General Abbas Nilforoushan, who died alongside the Hezbollah leader.</p>

<p>"Nasrallah has been crucial to Iran's power expansion," said Karim Sadjadpour of the Carnegie Endowment, noting that Hezbollah remains "the crown jewel" of the Islamic republic's regional allies.</p>

<p>His killing "has not altered the fact that Iran still does not want to get directly engaged" in the ongoing conflict, said Ali Vaez of the International Crisis group.</p>

<p>But it left Iran with "a serious dilemma", said Vaez, especially that the group's deterrence regarding Israel was now "in complete disarray".</p>

<p>Economic crisis</p>

<p>For Tehran-based international relations professor Mehdi Zakerian, developments have shown that the Iran-aligned resistance front "was not only unable to contain Israel, it also suffered serious blows".</p>

<p>Nasrallah's death came around two months after Palestinian group Hamas's political chief Ismail Haniyeh was killed in late July in Tehran where he had attended President Masoud Pezeshkian's inauguration.</p>

<p>Iran blamed Israel for his death and vowed to retaliate.</p>

<p>Zakerian says rebuilding Hezbollah will be no small feat for Tehran amid its mounting economic challenges.</p>

<p>"If the government wants to get involved in reconstructing Lebanon or re-equipping Hezbollah, it will aggravate Iran's economic crisis," he said.</p>

<p>Iran has been reeling from the economic impact of international sanctions, which have contributed to soaring inflation, high unemployment and a record low rate for the Iranian rial against the US dollar.</p>

<p>Pezeshkian's government has boosted efforts to help ease the crippling sanctions and revive a 2015 landmark nuclear deal which collapsed when the United States unilaterally withdrew from the accord three years later.</p>

<p>Analysts have said Iran has been treading carefully since the outbreak of the Gaza conflict, trying to project power without provoking a US response.</p>

<p>Even during its first-ever direct attack on Israel in April -- retaliation for an air strike on Tehran's embassy annex in Damascus -- most projectiles were intercepted by Israeli defences or allied forces.</p>

<p>Iran said at the time it had informed the United States and given neighbouring nations a 72-hour warning before what it called its "limited" attack on Israel.</p>

<p>Still, Vaez said Iran "has every interest in trying to preserve whatever remains of Hezbollah. Hezbollah is Iran's shield."</p>

<p>"I don't think Iranians would give up on almost 40 years of investment in this project overnight because a dozen people were eliminated," he added.</p>

<p>'Weak and meagre'</p>

<p>And "Iran cannot abandon Hezbollah, because in that case it would also lose its other allies", said Zakerian.</p>

<p>Iran-backed militant groups in Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, and Yemen have all become involved in rising regional tensions since the Israel's war against Hamas erupted.</p>

<p>Another strong dilemma Iran may face is communicating with Hezbollah and the transfer of weapons, analysts say.</p>

<p>On Friday, Israel's military vowed to prevent Iran from supplying Hezbollah with weapons via Beirut airport, saying its fighters were patrolling the skies above.</p>

<p>"It is too late now for Iran to support Hezbollah with weapons," said political commentator Mossadegh Mossadeghpour.</p>

<p>But he said he believes the group "will repair itself as it has done in the past".</p>

<p>Hezbollah's internal communications were also dealt a heavy blow when sabotage attacks this month targeted members' pagers and walkie-talkies.</p>

<p>Vaez believes it would be "very difficult" for the Iranians to communicate now with their allies, unlike during the 33-day war in 2006 between Israel and Hezbollah.</p>

<p>He said Hezbollah's "weak and meagre" responses have been noted as the violence with Israel has escalated.</p>

<p>"The question is whether they are unwilling or unable to take action," he said.</p>

<p>Vaez maintains that Iran appears to be hoping that Hezbollah will "get its act together ... and mount a significant attack on Israel to demonstrate it's still standing."</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In an effort to minimise administrative expenditures, cash-strapped Pakistan on Sunday announced to abolish about 150,000 government posts, close six ministries, and merge two others, as part of reforms agreed upon with the IMF under USD 7 billion loan deal.</p>

<p>The International Monetary Fund on September 26 finally gave a nod to the assistance package and also released over USD 1 billion as the first tranche after Pakistan committed to cut expenditures, increase tax-to GDP ratio, tax non-traditional sectors like agriculture and real estate, limit subsidies and transfer some fiscal responsibilities to provinces.</p>

<p>Addressing the media on his return from the US, Minister for Finance Muhammad Aurangzeb said that a programme had been finalised with the IMF, which would be the last programme for Pakistan.</p>

<p>"We need to implement our policies to prove that it will be the last programme," he said, and emphasised that in order to join the G20, the economy must be formalised.</p>

<p>The minister said right-sizing within ministries was going on and the decision to close six ministries is set to be implemented, while two ministries will be merged. "Additionally, 150,000 posts across various ministries will be eliminated," Mr Aurangzeb said.</p>

<p>He dwelt at length on increasing tax revenues, noting that there were approximately 300,000 new taxpayers last year, and so far this year, 732,000 new taxpayers have registered, increasing the total number of taxpayers in the country from 1.6 million to 3.2 million.</p>

<p>Mr Aurangzeb also said that the non-filers category will be abolished and those not paying taxes will no longer be able to purchase property or vehicles.</p>

<p>The minister claimed that the economy was moving in the right direction and the country's foreign exchange reserves had increased, reaching their highest level. He highlighted significant growth in both national exports and IT exports, and stated that investor confidence regarding the strength of the economy is a major success.</p>

<p>Mr Aurangzeb stated that the policy rate has been reduced by 4.5 per cent by the government after coming to power, and expressed optimism that the exchange rate and policy rate will remain as expected.</p>

<p>"Our claim that the economy is improving is not a hollow claim because inflation has decreased due to government policies. Inflation has dropped to single digits," he said.</p>

<p>Pakistan has been struggling to fix its economy for the last many years and it was close to default in 2023 but a timely loan of USD 3 billion by the IMF saved the situation.</p>

<p>Pakistan has negotiated a long-term loan with the global lender with the hope and commitment that it would be the last loan. However, many doubt this claim as the country has already secured about two dozen loans from the Fund but failed to address the economy on a permanent basis.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The two frontrunners in the race to replace Rishi Sunak as Conservative Party leader have thrown the spotlight on cutting immigration into the UK, with visas for Indians being singled out in heated debates.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The two frontrunners in the race to replace Rishi Sunak as Conservative Party leader and take his place in the House of Commons as Leader of the Opposition have thrown the spotlight on cutting immigration into the UK, with visas for Indians being singled out in heated debates.</p>

<p>Against the backdrop of the launch of the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham on Sunday, former immigration minister Robert Jenrick singled out India as one of the countries that should be subjected to tough visa restrictions across all categories unless it takes back its nationals who enter Britain illegally.</p>

<p>His closest contender, shadow housing secretary Kemi Badenoch, has also zeroed in on the same issue and condemned new migrants bringing their disputes from India to cause unrest on the streets of the country.</p>

<p>"It is quite clear that there are many people who have recently come to this country who have brought views from their countries of origin that have no place here,” Badenoch told the BBC.</p>

<p>"I saw as equalities minister people bringing cultural disputes from India to the streets of Leicester… we need to make sure that when people come to this country, they leave their previous differences behind. This is not a controversial thing to say,” she said.</p>

<p>Nigerian-heritage Badenoch, considered among the favourites to win the ongoing Tory leadership election, was apparently referencing the clashes that broke out in Leicester in September 2022 in the wake of an India-Pakistan Asia Cup cricket match.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, her former ministerial colleague Robert Jenrick who has notched up an early lead in the contest told ‘The Daily Telegraph' earlier this week that while India benefited from 250,000 visas in the past year, there were as many as 100,000 Indian nationals estimated to be illegally residing in the UK.</p>

<p>He lamented that deportations or removals to India remain stuck in the hundreds despite an India-UK Migration and Mobility Partnership which is designed to cover such returns of illegal migrants.</p>

<p>"The government must stop other countries exploiting our generosity by imposing severe visa restrictions and restricting foreign aid to countries that do not take back their nationals here illegally,” said Jenrick.</p>

<p>Over the four-day Tory conference starting on Sunday, Jenrick and Badenoch will go head-to-head with two other party colleagues – former Cabinet ministers James Cleverly and Tom Tugendhat – as they make their leadership pitches before MPs vote in the next round. This time the field will be whittled down to the final two candidates who will then fight it out for the online ballot of the wider Conservative Party membership, many of whom will be making up their minds during the party conference. The new Conservative Party chief and Opposition Leader is then scheduled to be declared on November 2 after the voting closes.</p>

<p>The election follows the resignation of Sunak as Tory leader in the wake of the party's bruising general election defeat in July under his leadership. The British Indian politician, who was re-elected member of Parliament from Richmond and Northallerton in northern England, has meanwhile been serving as interim leader until his successor is elected.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel carried out a fresh attack Sunday on Hezbollah's southern Beirut bastion, a Lebanese security official told AFP, with the Israeli military announcing a "precise strike".</p>

<p>The latest attack came days after a similar strike killed the group's powerful leader Hassan Nasrallah, sending tensions soaring amid intensive Israeli strikes on the country's east, south and south Beirut.</p>

<p>"Israel carried out an air strike on Beirut's southern suburb," said the Lebanese official, requesting anonymity to discuss sensitive matters.</p>

<p>AFP correspondents heard a loud explosion and saw smoke billowing from the area.</p>

<p>Lebanon's state-run National News Agency reported a "violent raid carried out by Israeli warplanes", adding that ambulances had rushed to the area of Beirut's southern suburbs.</p>

<p>A witness told AFP a rocket hit a building, which instantly collapsed.</p>

<p>In recent days, Israel has shifted the focus of its military operations from Gaza to Lebanon, after nearly a year of low-level cross-border fire with Hezbollah, killing hundreds in Lebanon and displacing scores more.</p>

<p>The group began exchanging cross-border fire with Israel in support of ally Hamas a day after the Palestinian militant group's unprecedented October 7 attack on Israel, which triggered war in the Gaza Strip.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said Sunday that the death of a senior Iranian general, killed alongside Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah in an Israeli strike on Beirut, "will not go unanswered".</p>

<p>Araghchi's remarks came two days after the Friday strike on Iran-backed Hezbollah's bastion in the Lebanese capital that killed General Abbas Nilforoushan, a top commander of the Quds Force, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps foreign operations arm.</p>

<p>"This horrible crime of the aggressor Zionist regime will not go unanswered," the top diplomat said according to a foreign ministry statement.</p>

<p>"The diplomatic apparatus will also use all its political, diplomatic, legal and international capacities to pursue the criminals and their supporters," he added.</p>

<p>Iranian officials have strongly condemned the killing of Hezbollah chief Nasrallah, whose powerful Lebanese movement has been armed and financed by the Islamic republic for years.</p>

<p>On Sunday, Iran's vice president for strategic affairs, Javad Zarif, said a response "will occur at the appropriate time and at Iran's choice, and decisions will definitely be made at the leadership level, at the highest level of the state," official news agency IRNA reported.</p>

<p>Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has the final say in all matters of state, has offered his condolences for Nasrallah's "martyrdom" and declared five days of public mourning.</p>

<p>Iranians on Sunday took to the streets of several cities across the country to express their anger at the killings of the Guards' Nilforoushan as well as Hezbollah's Nasrallah.</p>

<p>The secretary of Iran's Guardian Council, Ahmad Jannati, said Israel will "receive a forceful answer", threatening with "the destruction of the Zionist regime," according to Fars news agency.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lebanon's army on Sunday warned Lebanese against actions that would disturb public order in the crisis-hit country after Israel's killing of Hassan Nasrallah, leader of the powerful Iran-backed group Hezbollah.</p>

<p>The army in a statement said it "calls on citizens to preserve national unity and not to be drawn into actions that may affect civil peace at this dangerous and delicate stage", following the massive Friday strike that killed Nasrallah and as Israeli attacks continue.</p>

<p>"The Israeli enemy is working to implement its destructive plans and sow division among Lebanese," the army statement added.</p>

<p>Tiny Lebanon has long been divided along sectarian lines and witnessed a devastating 1975-1990 civil war.</p>

<p>Hezbollah, the Shiite Muslim movement that wields great power in Lebanon and whose military might is widely believed to dwarf Lebanon's armed forces, has drawn criticism from some Lebanese politicians over its decision to open a "support front" against Israel over the Gaza war nearly a year ago.</p>

<p>A Lebanese army official told AFP troops had been deployed since Saturday in Beirut, where thousands have sought refuge from intense Israeli raids on Lebanon's south and east and on Hezbollah's south Beirut bastion.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Najib Mikati urged Lebanese "to come together" to preserve civil order.</p>

<p>"Our national responsibility at this historic and exceptional moment requires setting aside political differences," he said on Saturday, after cutting short a New York trip.</p>

<p><strong>'Radio silent'</strong></p>

<p>United Nations special coordinator for Lebanon Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert also called for unity in a statement on X on Sunday.</p>

<p>"At this critical moment for Lebanon when uncertainty is rife, now is the time for the country to focus on the common interest that unites its people," she said.</p>

<p>Even the parties traditionally opposed to the powerful Iran-backed group have refrained from making fiery statements following Nasrallah's killing.</p>

<p>The Lebanese Forces, a Christian party widely viewed as one of Hezbollah's fiercest critics, even ordered supporters to go "radio silent" on social media in a message circulated on their groups, a source close to the party told AFP.</p>

<p>On Saturday, former prime minister Saad Hariri called on Lebanese to "rise above differences", adding that Nasrallah's killing "has plunged Lebanon and the region into a new phase of violence".</p>

<p>An international court had found that Hezbollah operatives were behind the 2005 killing of his father Rafic Hariri, also a former Lebanese premier.</p>

<p>Hezbollah began exchanging cross-border fire with Israel in support of ally Hamas a day after the Palestinian group's unprecedented October 7 attack on Israel, which triggered war in Gaza.</p>

<p>Israel has over the past days shifted the focus of its operation from Gaza to Lebanon, where heavy bombing since Monday has killed hundreds of people and displaced tens of thousands.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Intense Israeli attacks may have forced up to a million people to flee parts of Lebanon in possibly the worst displacement crisis in the tiny country's history, Prime Minister Najib Mikati said Sunday.</p>

<p>Mikati told reports that "the estimated number is very high and may reach one million" -- which would amount to roughly a sixth of Lebanon's population.</p>

<p>"It is the largest displacement movement that may have happened... in Lebanon," he said.</p>

<p>On Friday, Israel killed Hezbollah's powerful leader Hassan Nasrallah in a move many fear risks destabilising Lebanon and the wider region.</p>

<p>Since Monday, intense Israeli attacks across Lebanon's east, south and on southern Beirut have killed hundreds of people and forced many to flee their homes.</p>

<p>Earlier this week, UN refugee chief Filippo Grandi said "well over 200,000 people are displaced inside Lebanon" and more than 50,000 had fled to neighbouring Syria.</p>

<p>The intensive strikes come as Israel shifted the focus of its operation from Gaza to Lebanon, after nearly a year of cross-border fire with Hezbollah over the Gaza war, with the group saying it is acting in support of ally Hamas.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Israeli military said on Sunday it had killed a senior Hezbollah official in an air strike on a Beirut suburb the day before, as it continued to target the Lebanese armed group.</p>

<p>The military said Nabil Qaouq, a member of Hezbollah's central council, was "struck and eliminated" on Saturday, just a day after the group's chief Hassan Nasrallah was killed in a similar strike.</p>

<p>A source close to Hezbollah confirmed to AFP that Qaouq was killed in a strike on Saturday and identified him as a member of Hezbollah's central council in charge of security in the group.</p>

<p>"Qaouq was considered to be close to Hezbollah's senior commanders, and directly engaged in terrorist attacks against the state of Israel and its citizens, even in recent days," the military said in a statement.</p>

<p>He joined Hezbollah in the 1980s and was "regarded as an important source of expertise in his field", the military added.</p>

<p>In recent weeks, Israel has launched widespread strikes targeting senior Hezbollah commanders and the group's weapons sites in southern and eastern Lebanon and in its south Beirut bastion.</p>

<p>On Friday, it killed the group's chief Nasrallah in a strike that sent shock waves across the Middle East.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Princess Theodora of Greece tied the knot with her fiance, Matthew Kumar, in a stunning royal wedding at the Athens Cathedral on Saturday. The traditional Greek Orthodox ceremony brought together esteemed guests and marked the culmination of a love story that began years ago. Notably, Mr Kumar, an LA-based lawyer, proposed to Princess Theodora in 2018, but their special day was delayed twice due to unforeseen circumstances. The COVID-19 pandemic initially pushed back their plans, and later, the death of Theodora's father, Prince Michael of Greece and Denmark, in January 2023, further postponed the wedding.</p>

<p>Princess Theodora, goddaughter of the late Queen Elizabeth II, is the daughter of the late King of Greece and Queen Anne-Marie. Born in London, Theodora pursued her passion for the arts, graduating with a degree in Theatre Arts. She later relocated to Los Angeles in 2010 to embark on an acting career, making her television debut in the popular soap opera "The Bold and the Beautiful" in 2011. Meanwhile, Theodora's husband, Matthew Kumar, is a 34-year-old attorney born and raised in Southern California.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On the eve of their nuptials, the couple hosted an intimate gathering at the Byzantine Museum, surrounded by close family and friends. Notable attendees included Crown Prince Pavlos and Crown Princess Marie-Chantal. The bride-to-be dazzled in a chic white mini-dress adorned with a delicate bow.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The following day, the wedding took place at Athens' majestic Metropolitan Cathedral of the Annunciation. Princess Theodora was elegantly escorted down the aisle by her brother, Crown Prince Pavlos. His Eminence Metropolitan of Syros, Dorotheos II, officiated the traditional Greek Orthodox ceremony, blessing the union of Princess Theodora and Matthew Kumar.</p>

<p>In the days leading up to her death, many fans noted that Aykut's final posts on social media seemed increasingly concerning. Just hours before her death, she sent a heartbreaking letter on her social media account about her weight gain experience. She expressed in her last post, ''I've gathered my energy, but I can't seem to gain weight. I lose a kilogram every day. I don't know what to do; I urgently need to gain weight.'' In her last TikTok video, she was seen cleaning her apartment shortly before her tragic fall.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Notably, she gained widespread recognition on TikTok in 2023 with her unconventional and empowering "Wedding without a Groom" series. In a bold statement, she symbolically "married" herself, wearing a stunning white gown and tiara, declaring, "I can't find a worthy groom for myself." She was also seen driving away in a car while carrying her bouquet and cheering.&nbsp;Another viral clip featured her humorously enjoying a burger in her wedding attire, referring to herself as a "nervous bride."</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The NASA-SpaceX spacecraft, carrying Crew-9 members NASA astronaut Nick Hague (commander) and Roscosmos cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov (mission specialist), was on its way to the International Space Station (ISS) on Sunday, in a mission that aims to bring stranded Indian-origin astronaut Sunita Williams back to Earth in February next year.</p>

<p>The NASA-SpaceX mission safely reached orbit, after it was successfully launched from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida. This mission is significant as it marks the first human spaceflight to launch from Space Launch Complex 40.</p>

<p>"SpaceX Dragon spacecraft is on its way to the International Space Station (ISS). The new crew arrives at the orbiting lab Sunday, Sept. 29, for a five-month science mission," NASA posted on X social media platform.</p>

<p>The targeted docking time is approximately 5:30 p.m. Sunday (3.30 am Monday India time), according to NASA.</p>

<p>The Crew-9 members will have two empty seats for NASA astronauts Barry Wilmore and Sunita Williams will fill when the spacecraft returns next year.</p>

<p>The Crew-9 was initially expected to launch on Thursday but was postponed due to poor weather conditions due to hurricane Helene, currently impacting the Gulf Coast of Florida.</p>

<p>Williams and Willmore travelled to the ISS on an eight-day sojourn on the faulty Boeing's Starliner. While the Starliner was declared unfit for human travel by NASA, and it returned safely to Earth, the astronaut duo are stuck in space.</p>

<p>For the first time since the May 2020 test flight, SpaceX launched two astronauts to the ISS on a Dragon spacecraft.</p>

<p>In a bid to make room for Williams and Willmore in the orbiting lab, NASA had pulled out two other Crew-9 members -- commander Zena Cardman and three-time shuttle flier Stephanie Wilson.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Hezbollah's leader Hassan Nasrallah was killed on Saturday in an Israeli airstrike targeting an underground bunker in Beirut.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hezbollah's leader Hassan Nasrallah was killed on Friday in an Israeli airstrike targeting an underground bunker in Beirut. The meticulously planned attack, carried out by the Israeli Air Force, involved the collaboration of multiple intelligence agencies and resulted in the death of several senior Hezbollah officials alongside Nasrallah.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The strike took place in southern Beirut and targeted a heavily fortified bunker located over 60 feet underground. Nasrallah and other high-ranking members of the Iran-backed group had gathered to discuss strategies against Israel, amidst mounting pressure from Tehran to avoid immediate retaliatory actions, according to a report by the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.wsj.com/world/middle-east/how-israel-killed-hezbollahs-leader-in-underground-bunker-52946d6d" rel="nofollow,noindex">Wall Street Journal</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In what is being described as one of the largest strikes on an urban centre in recent history, the Israeli military used nearly 80 tons of explosives, including approximately 85 specialised “bunker-buster” bombs designed to penetrate deep into fortified structures. These munitions, capable of piercing through up to 30 metres of earth or six metres of reinforced concrete, were used to breach the bunker's defences and ensure the precision of the strike.</p>

<p>“Everything we planned was executed precisely, with no errors, both in intelligence, the planning, with the planes and the operation itself. Everything went smooth,” the commander of the IAF's 69th Squadron told reporters, as per the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-knew-of-nasrallahs-location-for-months-some-ministers-opposed-hit-reports/" rel="nofollow,noindex">Times of Israel</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The bunker-buster bombs weigh between 907 kg and 1,814 kg. The design of bombs traces back to advanced artillery developed during World War II, specifically the Rochling shells.</p>

<p>Israel's military campaign had intensified, with over 2,000 airstrikes in Lebanon leading up to the attack. The attack also targeted Hezbollah's military assets, destroying crucial electronic equipment and a cache of missiles. Israeli military officials indicated that months of planning had gone into the operation, with real-time intelligence confirming Nasrallah's presence in the bunker at the time of the strike. Israeli spokesperson Nadav Shoshani told the WSJ, “We had intelligence that Nasrallah was meeting with senior terrorists, and we acted accordingly.”</p>

<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu authorised the strike while addressing the United Nations General Assembly in New York. During his speech, Netanyahu condemned terrorism and stressed Israel's commitment to securing its borders. In his first public remarks following the attack, Netanyahu referred to Nasrallah as “the terrorist,” saying, “His removal is essential to achieving our goals.”</p>

<p>The conflict has already displaced tens of thousands of people on both sides of the Israel-Lebanon border. The United Nations reported that over 2,00,000 Lebanese civilians have been displaced in the last week alone, with many more expected to flee as the fighting intensifies.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Israel has vowed to continue its military operations against Hezbollah until the group ceases its attacks.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p>

<p>Hours before Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah was killed in an airstrike in Lebanon's Beirut, an Iranian mole informed Israeli authorities of his location, French newspaper Le Parisien has reported.</p>

<p>Citing a security source in Lebanon, the report said the mole had informed Israeli authorities that Nasrallah would be at Hezbollah's underground headquarters in Beirut's southern suburbs to attend a meeting with several top members of the organisation.</p>

<p>Around 1.30 pm IST yesterday (11 am Lebanon time), Israel Defence Forces said in a post on X, "Hassan Nasrallah will no longer be able to terrorize the world." Later in the day, Hezbollah confirmed the news. "Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah... has joined his great, immortal martyr comrades whom he led for about 30 years," it said in a statement.</p>

<p><strong>How Israel Boosted Spies In Fight Against Hezbollah</strong></p>

<p>According to a report in The New York Times, Israel's recent successes against Hezbollah are a direct result of the country's decision to devote far more intelligence resources to target Hezbollah after the 2006 war with the Iran-backed group. The Israeli army and the intelligence agencies, the report said, failed to score a decisive victory in that 34-day conflict. The war ended with a UN-brokered cease-fire and allowed Hezbollah, despite losses, to regroup and prepare for the next war.</p>

<p>In the years that followed, Israel deployed a lot of resources to collect information about Hezbollah's leadership and strategy. Unit 8200, Israel's signals intelligence agency, built cutting-edge cyber tools to better intercept Hezbollah's cellphones and other communications, the NYT report said. New teams were created within combat ranks to ensure that valuable information was quickly passed on to soldiers and the air force, it added.</p>

<p><strong>The Pager Bombs And Nasrallah's Admission</strong></p>

<p>In a recent televised speech, Nasrallah had said Hezbollah suffered an "unprecedented blow" after Israel detonated explosive-laden pagers and hand-held radios. The attacks killed 37 people and wounded nearly 3,000 people in two days. Nasrallah had then warned Israel of "tough retribution and just punishment, where it expects it and where it does not".</p>

<p>A Lebanese investigation found that the pagers had been booby-trapped, AFP reported.</p>

<p>Hezbollah members had started communicating via pagers and walkie-talkies after Israel penetrated cellphones. But that did not protect them.</p>

<p>The Mossad, the NYT report said, appears to have created a shell company in Budapest and made the pagers under license from a company in Taiwan. Before the pagers arrived in Lebanon, Israeli operatives installed explosives inside them. The operation was scaled to produce thousands of pagers, requiring sophisticated manufacturing, it said.</p>

<p><strong>Top Hezbollah Leaders Targeted</strong></p>

<p>According to the NYT report, Israel's investment in greater intelligence gathering first paid off in 2008 when Mossad worked with the CIA to kill top Hezbollah operative, Imad Mugniyah, in Syria. In 2020, Qassim Suleimani, who headed Iran's Quds Force, flew to Syria's Damascus and drove in a convoy to Beirut to meet Nasrallah. Israel did not try to kill Nasrallah then for fear of starting a war. It passed on the information to the US and Suleimani was killed in a drone strike at Baghdad airport, the report said.</p>

<p>The October 7 attacks by Hamas on Israeli cities set off the ongoing conflict in the Middle East. As Israel's counterstrike set off a war in Gaza, Hezbollah started targeting Israel.</p>

<p>Over the past couple of months, Tel Aviv went all-out against Hezbollah. A strike on July 30 killed Fuad Shukr, one of the group's top military commanders. About three weeks later, a strike killed Ibrahim Aqil, head of Hezbollah's elite Radwan Force, and 15 other commanders. Days later, another strike killed Ibrahim Mohammed Kobeissi, who commanded several Hezbollah units, including a guided missiles unit. The next day, Mohammed Srur, the head of Hezbollah's drone unit, was killed in a strike.</p>

<p>Chip Usher, a former CIA analyst who has worked with Israeli intelligence, has told NYT, "The secrets of their success come down to a couple of factors. They have a fairly defined target deck. That makes it easier for them to bring a tremendous amount of focus to what they do. They're in a shadow war with Hezbollah and Iran. And they're extraordinarily patient."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A mystery dating back over three millennia is being unravelled in the Tollense River Valley of northeast Germany. What seems like a peaceful landscape today was once the site of a fierce and bloody confrontation that archaeologists now identify as Europe's oldest-known battlefield.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It all began in 1996 when an amateur archaeologist stumbled upon a human bone protruding from the riverbank. This small discovery sparked a much larger investigation, and excavations that began in 2008 have since revealed thousands of skeletal remains and hundreds of weapons, preserved by the valley's pristine environment. Experts now estimate that these remnants belonged to a large-scale battle that took place around 1,250 BCE, during the late Bronze Age.</p>

<p>While much of the ancient conflict remains a puzzle, the meticulous analysis of newly uncovered artefacts has brought researchers closer to understanding who fought in this brutal clash and why. One of the most intriguing discoveries is the presence of arrowheads – some locally produced, and others from regions far to the south.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A recent analysis of dozens of arrowheads found at the site, some still embedded in human bones, has provided critical new insights. The comparison of the shapes and materials of the weapons reveals that while many were made locally, others bore distinctly southern characteristics, originating from regions as far away as present-day Bavaria and Moravia.</p>

<p>The discovery of these southern arrowheads suggests that an army from the south clashed with local northern tribes in the valley. Researchers believe this battle could have occurred near a key landmark along the Tollense River, a place that might have been strategically significant for control over trade or territory.</p>

<p>Though the exact motivations behind the battle remain elusive, the presence of distant armies in what was once considered a local tribal skirmish indicates a much larger, organised conflict. This may rewrite the history of inter-regional relations in Bronze Age Europe.</p>

<p>The Tollense Valley battlefield offers an unprecedented glimpse into a period when organised warfare was becoming more common in Europe. With thousands of bodies scattered across the site, the scale of the conflict is far greater than what was previously thought possible for the time. Archaeologists have uncovered evidence of brutal injuries, including skull fractures and stab wounds, as well as the remains of horses and military equipment.</p>

<p>While excavations continue at the Tollense site, the power of modern technology is helping archaeologists make even more groundbreaking discoveries. Tools like artificial intelligence (AI) and satellite imagery are being employed to scan the valley and surrounding areas, searching for hidden sites that might provide further clues to the nature of the conflict.</p>

<p>The discovery of southern arrowheads at the Tollense site raises more questions than it answers. Why would warriors travel hundreds of kilometres to engage in battle here? What were they fighting for? And why was this battle so significant that it left behind such a vast number of dead?</p>

<p>Researchers continue to study the remains and artefacts from the battlefield in hopes of piecing together a more complete picture. One hypothesis is that the battle may have been part of a broader struggle for control over trade routes that passed through the region. The Tollense River, after all, could have been a key artery for transporting goods, making it a valuable prize for any power looking to expand its influence.</p>

<p>For now, the arrowheads and bones scattered across the valley are silent witnesses to a forgotten war.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A farmer in northern Thailand was forced to cull more than 100 crocodiles from his farm as heavy floods raised fears that they could escape and pose a threat to human lives. Natthapak Khumkad, the owner of a crocodile farm in Lamphun, explained that days of relentless rain had severely damaged the enclosures holding his Siamese crocodiles.</p>

<p>With the animals at risk of escaping, he decided to kill 125 crocodiles, which measured up to three meters long. Mr Khumkad was particularly concerned that the reptiles might roam the flooded countryside, potentially attacking locals and animals.</p>

<p>The incident, reported by CNN on Friday, took place in the Lamphun province following devastating monsoon rains that have swept across the region. In September, northern Thailand was hit by intense monsoon rains, which resulted in landslides and floods that killed over 20 people.</p>

<p>"I had to make the most difficult decision of my life to kill them all. My family and I discussed if the wall collapsed the damage to people's lives would be far bigger than we can control. It would involve people's lives and public safety," the farmer told CNN.</p>

<p>In a Facebook post, Natthapak Khumkad showed the eroded walls of the crocodile pond and explained, "This was the primary reason that forced me to make an urgent decision. On that day, it rained heavily non-stop. The underwater wall collapsed, which was very close to reaching the outer wall."</p>

<p>He clarified that although his staff attempted to block off the area to fix the pond as soon as possible, the unceasing rain made the situation dangerous.</p>

<p>"It was a crisis that required an extremely urgent decision. I had to use the last resort, which was to remove the crocodiles from the farm by slaughtering them. If it wasn't absolutely necessary, we wouldn't have used this method. It was the best, fastest, and safest method in that situation, with the rain still pouring incessantly. Thank you for all the encouragement and understanding.,"&nbsp;Natthapak added.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Indian-origin doctor and former COVID-19 czar of New York City, Jay Varma is facing severe criticism for lying under oath by testifying that vaccination is the sole means of stopping the spread of coronavirus. This comes after hidden-camera footage surfaced, revealing Mr Varma, the&nbsp;former COVID czar of New York City, boasting about attending drug-fuelled sex parties during the pandemic.</p>

<p>Jay Varma, who was a senior health advisor to ex-Mayor Bill de Blasio during the height of the pandemic, confessed in newly released footage that natural immunity to the virus is equally effective as vaccination. “It doesn't make any difference at all... Everybody's been exposed to the virus. Whether you're exposed to the virus because it's breathed on you or because you got injected into you. It's the same immune response,” he said, as per the NY Post.&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DulLO6C0Dik?si=PED24gIrguT2TC58" title="YouTube video player" width="560"></iframe></p>

<p>However, during multiple lawsuits against COVID mandates, Mr Varma provided contradictory testimony, in which he said, “The COVID-19 vaccine has been shown to offer those persons with a prior COVID-19 infection greater protection against reinfection.”</p>

<p>The controversy arose after the footage, filmed by a hidden camera and released by podcaster Steven Crowder, showed Mr Varma discussing the limitations of vaccine mandates. Critics have since accused him of providing false testimony, leading to a growing call for legal action.</p>

<p>Councilwoman Joann Ariola (R-Queens) has accused Mr Varma of perjury, or, lying under oath, and emphasised that his misleading testimony led to vaccination mandates that harmed many New Yorkers. Ms Ariola said, “Dr. Varma swore under oath that the vaccine was the most effective way to prevent the spread of new COVID strains, but in captured footage, he privately acknowledges that there was, in reality, no difference between vaccinations and natural immunity,” Ariola said. “This is outright perjury . . . perjury that cost thousands their livelihoods – and he must be held accountable for his actions.”</p>

<p>Jay Varma has not publicly responded to the allegations, though he previously described the hidden-camera footage as “spliced, diced, and taken out of context.” He was also recently <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/indians-abroad/dr-jay-varma-fired-from-job-after-revelations-of-pandemic-era-sex-parties-6644220 ">fired from SIGA Technologies</a>&nbsp;after revelations of his involvement in drug-fuelled sex parties during the pandemic.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In what would become his final speech on September 19, Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah denounced Israel's deadly attacks across Lebanon and framed the situation as a potential “declaration of war.” The chief of the Iran-backed group vowed retaliation, asserting that the Israeli aggressions would be met with “a just punishment.”</p>

<p>This speech came just days before Israeli forces targeted Hezbollah's central headquarters in an airstrike, killing Nasrallah and senior Hezbollah commander Ibrahim Aqil.</p>

<p>During his address, Nasrallah reflected on the recent Israeli strikes that killed 32 people and destroyed Hezbollah's communication networks, including radios and pagers across Lebanon. He described the situation as “big tests” and said that “the important thing is to not let the blow knock you down.” He also added that with faith in God, Hezbollah would emerge from this crisis “with heads raised high.”</p>

<p>“The important thing is to not let the blow knock you down, no matter how big and strong it is, and I tell you with all reassurance, confidence and reliance on God that this big, strong and unprecedented bow did not knock us down and will not knock us down, God willing,” Nasrallah said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Nasrallah's rhetoric was aimed not only at Israel but also in support of Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank. “We say to the enemy's government, army and society, that the Lebanese front will not stop before the aggression on Gaza stops,” he said. “We have been saying this for 11 months.”</p>

<p>Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah's speech came amid escalating violence along the Israel-Lebanon border, where Israeli and Hezbollah forces have been clashing since the start of the war in Gaza.</p>

<p>On Friday, September 20, Israel carried out a targeted strike, killing Ibrahim Aqil, the commander of Hezbollah's elite Radwan unit, along with 12 others in Beirut. Aqil had been a senior figure in the organisation and was also wanted by the US for his involvement in the 1983 bombing of the American embassy in Beirut.</p>

<p>The Israeli military described the operation as part of its broader efforts to weaken Hezbollah. As both sides escalated their attacks, fears of a broader war between Israel and Hezbollah intensified, leaving civilians on both sides caught in the crossfire. Residents of border towns in southern Lebanon recounted that the bombardments were the most intense they had witnessed since hostilities began.</p>

<p>International mediators, including US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, have called for restraint to prevent the conflict from spiralling into a full-blown regional war. However, Nasrallah's last speech made clear that Hezbollah would not back down, with the leader's words echoing even after his death: “Whatever the sacrifices, whatever the consequences, the resistance in Lebanon will not stop supporting the people of Gaza and the West Bank who are oppressed in that holy land.”</p>

<p>Israeli airstrikes on Lebanon have killed over 1,000 people and displaced nearly half a million since Monday. Meanwhile, in Gaza, the death count has now risen to nearly 42,000, with almost the entire population of the region displaced due to relentless bombardment. The humanitarian crisis has deepened, with food, water and medical supplies dwindling under the continuous siege.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The alleged crime occurred at a campground in Rogers, where the 21-year-old father, 20-year-old mother, and their baby have been living for approximately three months.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A couple from Northwest Arkansas is accused of attempting to sell their baby boy for $1,000 and beer, according to court documents in the felony case.&nbsp;As detailed in a Benton County Sheriff's Office arrest affidavit, the alleged crime occurred at a campground in Rogers, where Darien Urban, 21, and Shalene Ehlers, and their baby have been living for approximately three months. Rogers is situated in the Ozarks near the borders of Oklahoma and Missouri.</p>

<p>The condition of the baby was not immediately known as of Thursday.</p>

<p>According to the affidavit obtained by<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/09/26/arkansas-couple-sell-baby-for-money-beer-allegations/75393884007/" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em> USA TODAY</em></a>, deputies were called to Beaver Lake Hide Away Campground on September 21 after a report from someone in the manager's office claimed the couple was attempting to give their baby away in exchange for money and beer. The caller also informed authorities that the baby required medical attention due to observed rashes and blisters around the child's buttocks and genitals.</p>

<p>When deputies arrived, a detective noted in the affidavit that the couple was not present, and the baby was taken to a children's hospital.</p>

<p>The affidavit states that one witness approached the couple's camper, asked to take the baby overnight, and provided the couple with beers. The man told deputies that the couple agreed, so he took the baby out of concern for his welfare.</p>

<p>Another witness, a woman at the campground, also took the baby, changed his diaper, and bathed him. She captured photos of the blisters and rash to present to authorities.</p>

<p>On-site, deputies found a letter allegedly signed by the couple, agreeing to accept a cashier's check for $1,000 on Monday in exchange for the child. The letter stated, "I, Darien Urban and Shalene Ehlers are signing our rights over to Cody Nathaniel Martin of our baby boy [redacted] for $1,000 on 09/21/2024," the letter reads. "Disclaimer: After signing this there will be no changing yall two's minds and to never contact again."</p>

<p>Detectives also obtained cellphone video of both parents signing the letter.</p>

<p>During their interview with detectives, the couple claimed their baby "was undergoing an adoption" and stated they recorded the video because they planned to finalize the adoption on Monday, according to the affidavit.</p>

<p>Deputies arrested the couple and booked them into local jail on charges of felony endangering the welfare of a child and attempted relinquishment of a minor for adoption. A judge set their bond at $50,000 each.</p>

<p>Court and jail records indicated that both defendants were released on Thursday.</p>

<p>The parents are scheduled to appear in court on October 29.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A "partial peace" with Armenia is not a possibility, Azerbaijan's foreign minister said Saturday at the UN General Assembly's annual gathering, after Yerevan offered a more optimistic message.</p>

<p>The two former Soviet republics had seen decades of war and tension over Nagorno-Karabakh, a breakaway ethnic Armenian region in Azerbaijan.</p>

<p>After a series of slow-moving negotiations, Azerbaijan rushed in troops last year and swiftly seized back the area, whose entire population of nearly 120,000 people fled to Armenia.</p>

<p>"Partial peace is not an option after so much pain and suffering inflicted by... territorial claims against neighbors," Jeyhun Bayramov told the gathering, insisting in particular on a change to Armenia's constitution, which refers to "reunification" with Nagorno-Karabakh.</p>

<p>Azerbaijan's lightning offensive last year unfolded during the high-level UN meetings in New York, sparking disbelief and chagrin among Western diplomats, especially US and French officials who had been deeply involved in mediation efforts.</p>

<p>On Thursday, Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan said peace with Azerbaijan "not only is possible, but is within reach."</p>

<p>Azerbaijan and Armenia both say that 80 percent of a treaty is ready, including border delineation, but Azerbaijan first wants a resolution of all issues.</p>

<p>In his UN address, Pashinyan said he was ready to meet the Baku government's key demand of allowing transportation access across Armenian soil to the exclave of Nakhchivan, letting Azerbaijan connect its main territory with its traditional ally Turkey.</p>

<p>Pashinyan insisted that Azerbaijan and Armenia should sign the draft treaty immediately, explaining, "There is no precedent of a peace agreement or any agreement that would regulate and solve everything."</p>

<p>But on Saturday, Bayramov said any finalization of a deal would require Armenia to "legally abandon territorial claims against Azerbaijan once and for all through implementing constitutional amendments" so Baku's territorial integrity would not be in "legal limbo."</p>

<p>He also accused Yerevan of making a "dramatic increase" in its military budget and acquiring a "large amount of offensive weaponry from both traditional and new suppliers."</p>

<p>Bayramov nevertheless acknowledged "significant progress" in efforts by the neighbors to normalize relations, calling for "expeditious steps" to complete the process "at this critical moment."</p>

<p>Any changes to Armenia's constitution must be done through a referendum, a long and uncertain process. Western diplomats said they saw the request as a way for Baku to ask for the impossible to avoid signing a deal.</p>

<p>Potentially adding to momentum for a deal is COP29, the annual UN climate change talks that bring together officials from across the world, which will take place in the Azerbaijani capital Baku in November.</p>

<p>The international community is applying added pressure on Baku to reach an agreement before COP29.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

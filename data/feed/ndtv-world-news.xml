       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The attempted assassination of former US president Donald Trump with a semi-automatic rifle illustrates once again how easy it is for shooters in the US to get their hands on inexpensive, easy-to-use, military-style weapons.</p>

<p>The AR-15-style rifle is one of the most popular guns in the US. It has also been a common denominator in some of the country's worst mass shootings.</p>

<p>Here are some key facts about the weapon:</p>

<p><strong>Why Are AR-15s So Lethal?</strong></p>

<p>The AR-15 is a semi-automatic weapon, meaning a user can fire multiple shots in quick succession.</p>

<p>Its cousin, the M-16, has been used by the US military since Vietnam. While some military assault rifles are fully automatic, civilians are prohibited from owning such weapons in most circumstances.</p>

<p>AR-15s fire high-velocity bullets that travel at triple the speed of a handgun round, are accurate over long distances, and cause expansive, devastating wounds to soft tissue and internal organs.</p>

<p>While handguns account for more deaths per year in the United States, AR-15s have frequently been used in high-profile mass shootings.</p>

<p>In May 2022, a former student used an AR-15 to shoot dead nineteen children and two teachers at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas.</p>

<p>The weapon was also used in October 2017 in Las Vegas, where a gunman massacred 60 people at a music festival.</p>

<p><strong>Cheap And Easy</strong></p>

<p>Buying an AR-15 is easy. Depending on the state of residence, a prospective owner can walk into a gun shop and, after presenting a valid ID, buy a rifle or shotgun provided they can pass a federal background check.</p>

<p>This process looks at a buyer's criminal history or whether they have ever been committed to a mental institution. But even this cursory check can be flouted in the case of private sales.</p>

<p>The National Rifle Association (NRA) touts the rifles for recreational target practice and home defense, but critics say their lethality means they do not belong in civilian hands.</p>

<p>Part of the reason for the popularity of AR-15s in America is that they are widely customizable, with owners able to add scopes, large-capacity magazines and a plethora of other accessories.</p>

<p>The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives does not know how many assault weapons there are in America -- they are prohibited by federal law from keeping a gun registry database.</p>

<p>A Washington Post poll in 2023 estimated that one in 20 American adults own at least one AR-15.</p>

<p><strong>Banned In Several States</strong></p>

<p>Assault weapons were banned in 1994 under president Bill Clinton, but the restriction lapsed in 2004 amid pressure from the powerful NRA.</p>

<p>Federal efforts at reforms to gun laws have been stymied ever since, with critics arguing that they infringe the constitutional right to own a firearm, enshrined in the Second Amendment.</p>

<p>Several states, like California, Illinois, Maryland, New Jersey and Washington DC, have however banned ownership of assault weapons.</p>

<p>California claims its gun safety laws have helped save 19,000 lives in a decade.</p>

<p>In May, President Joe Biden's administration moved to crack down on firearm sales at gun shows and online that evade federal background checks.</p>

<p>But several Republican-led states quickly sued to block the measure.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>American actor Shannen Doherty, best known for her role as high school student Brenda Walsh on the hit 1990s television drama "Beverly Hills, 90210," has died after years of living with cancer, People magazine reported on Sunday. She was 53.</p>

<p>"It is with a heavy heart that I confirm the passing of actress Shannen Doherty. On Saturday, July 13, she lost her battle with cancer after many years of fighting the disease," the magazine cited Doherty's publicist Leslie Sloane as saying.</p>

<p>Doherty had been public about her battle with breast cancer, disclosing in 2015 that she was undergoing treatment for the disease. In 2023, she had a brain tumor removed and revealed that the cancer had spread to her bones.</p>

<p>The actress, who had previously starred in the movie "Heathers," gained widespread popularity on "90210" for her portrayal of Brenda, an honor roll student from Minnesota who struggled to fit in with her classmates in the wealthy zip code.</p>

<p>Her character on the show became entwined in a love triangle with Dylan McKay (Luke Perry) and Kelly Taylor (Jennie Garth). In real life, Doherty clashed with Garth and other castmates and left "90210" during its fourth season in 1994. The show continued through 2000 without her.</p>

<p>In 1998, "90210" producer Aaron Spelling cast Doherty in the supernatural series "Charmed" as Prue Halliwell, the oldest of three sisters with magical abilities. The show was a hit, but also subject to reports of behind-the-scenes turmoil.</p>

<p>People magazine called Doherty "the iconic 'bad girl' of the nineties," citing her reputation for partying, turning up late on sets, and feuding with actors - and her bosses.</p>

<p>In 2023, on a podcast called "Let's Be Clear with Shannen Doherty," the actor said she took "full responsibility for her actions" and acknowledged her behavior "would get a little carried away" when she was frequenting nightclubs in her early 20s.</p>

<p>She also said she spoke up more than other women working in television at the time, telling Spelling and others when she thought a script needed improvement.</p>

<p>"I was raised to have an opinion, and that my opinion should be valued, so I just kept on pressing up against that machine, up against men who didn't really want to hear my opinion," she said on the podcast.</p>

<p>Later, "I learned the simple art of diplomacy. I learned that there might be a nicer way to say some things," she said.</p>

<p>The actor reprised the role of Brenda for "90210" reboots in 2008 and 2019 and said she and Garth had reconciled after the two became adults and left their teenage conflicts behind.</p>

<p>Doherty was born in Memphis, Tennessee, on April 12, 1971, and began acting as a child. At age 11, she played Jenny Wilder in the final season of TV classic "Little House on the Prairie."</p>

<p>In 1988, Doherty was cast in the dark comedy film "Heathers," which went on to become a cult classic.</p>

<p>Doherty was married three times, most recently to photographer Kurt Iswarienko. She filed for divorce from him in 2023.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Catherine, Princess of Wales, attended the Wimbledon Men's final in London on Sunday as she continues her cancer recovery, waving to the cheering Centre Court crowd as she took her seat.</p>

<p>The princess is also due to present the trophy to the winner of the final, which sees Serbian all-time great Novak Djokovic going up against defending Spanish champion Carlos Alcaraz.</p>

<p>The 42-year-old, wearing a purple dress, was accompanied by her 9-year-old daughter Charlotte as she talked to players before the match.</p>

<p>She was then cheered on by onlookers as she made her way to the world-famous Centre Court.</p>

</div>

<p>The crowd took to its feet as the princess entered the arena, applauding for around 30 seconds. Catherine waved back as she took her seat in the royal box, close to actors Tom Cruise, Zendaya, and Hugh Jackman.</p>

<p>Catherine last month tentatively returned to UK public life for the first time since her diagnosis, attending a military parade in London to mark King Charles III's official birthday.</p>

<p>It came nearly three months after the princess revealed she was receiving chemotherapy treatment. She had not been seen at a public engagement since a Christmas Day service last year.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The woman, who reportedly cares for five more children, was detained and charged with child abuse by negligence, which resulted in death.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A five-year-old boy in the United States died on Wednesday after his foster mother left him in a hot car for seven hours in extreme heat, as per the police officials. The boy was trapped in 89-degree Fahrenheit (31-degree Celsius) heat, making it the 10th hot car incident in the country, according to a report in the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/07/13/us-news/5-year-old-boy-dies-after-foster-mom-leaves-him-in-hot-car-for-7-hours-police/"><em>New York Post</em></a>.</p>

<p>Juanita Pinon, aged 40, is accused of abandoning her foster son Dionicio Perez inside a burning SUV in a parking lot outside the beauty salon where she is employed in Omaha, Nebraska, resulting in a tragic incident. Ms Pinon, who has a criminal history that dates back to 2016, according to the prosecution, parked her car and then left for work. However, it remains unclear whether Perez's death was a result of an accident or deliberate action.</p>

<p>Dionicio was declared dead at a nearby hospital when his body temperature rose to 105 degrees. The woman, who reportedly cares for five more children, was detained and charged with child abuse by negligence, which resulted in death. Notably, she could spend up to 20 years in jail if found guilty.</p>

<p>The local NBC affiliate reported that her bond was set at $2 million. Pinon had already been convicted of theft by deception in 2016 after defrauding non-English speaking renters out of $12,000. According to the report, the state government officials told the boy's biological father, Pablo Lopez, and stepmother, Jenny, that their son was in capable hands despite their pursuit of custody.</p>

<p>The five-year-old's twin sister, who turned five in June, is also under Lopez's custody, according to a GoFundMe page set up to raise money for a lawyer and to get "his sister safely home." "The twins were placed in foster care, despite their dad and step mom's efforts to bring the twins home. Their financial situation greatly limited them. The person who was supposed to care for him in foster care, had a criminal history," the GoFundMe page said.</p>

<p>"Dionicio's young life was cut short is the most horrendous way. The world lost such a bright, beautiful, young life far too soon," it added.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump said Sunday it was divine intervention that helped him survive an assassination attempt during a campaign rally in Pennsylvania, and called on Americans to unite.</p>

<p>"It was God alone who prevented the unthinkable from happening," the former US president and White House hopeful said on social media, urging fellow Americans to unite in "not allowing Evil to Win."</p>

<p>Trump was hit in the ear in an assassination attempt by a gunman at a campaign rally Saturday, in a chaotic and shocking incident set to supercharge political tensions ahead of the US presidential election.</p>

<p>The 78-year-old former president was rushed off stage with blood streaked across his face after the shooting in Butler, Pennsylvania, while the shooter and a bystander were killed and two spectators were critically injured.</p>

<p>President Joe Biden, who is set to face Trump in November's deeply polarized presidential election, said there was "no place in America for this kind of violence."</p>

<p>"In this moment, it is more important than ever that we stand United, and show our True Character as Americans, remaining Strong and Determined, and not allowing Evil to Win," Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform Sunday morning, confirming that he would attend the Republican National Convention, which begins on Monday in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Kremlin said on Sunday it did not believe the US administration was responsible for Saturday's assassination attempt on US presidential candidate Donald Trump, but that it had created an atmosphere that provoked the attack.</p>

<p>Trump was shot in the ear during a rally in Pennsylvania, in an attack now being investigated as an assassination attempt. The attacker was shot dead and law enforcement officials said they had not yet identified a motive.</p>

<p>"We do not believe that the attempt to eliminate and assassinate Trump was organised by the current authorities," Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.</p>

<p>"But the atmosphere around candidate Trump ... provoked what America is confronting today."</p>

<p>U.S. President Joe Biden condemned the attack, saying there was no place for that kind of violence in America. Peskov said Russia condemned any violence in the course of the political struggle.</p>

<p>His comments echoed those of some of Trump's Republican allies, who immediately pinned the blame on Biden.</p>

<p>"After numerous attempts to remove candidate Trump from the political arena - using first legal tools, the courts, prosecutors, attempts to politically discredit and compromise the candidate - it was obvious to all outside observers that his life was in danger," Peskov said.</p>

<p>He added that there were no plans for Putin to call Trump in light of the incident.</p>

<p>World leaders, including Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, rapidly condemned Saturday's attack, expressing shock, denouncing political violence, and wishing Trump a quick recovery.</p>

<p>Russia's foreign ministry used the shooting to urge Washington to stop funding Ukraine's military and concentrate on improving domestic law enforcement instead.</p>

<p>Foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova, writing on Telegram, responded to remarks made by independent presidential candidate Robert Kennedy Jr following the shooting.</p>

<p>"Dear Bobby and all those who vote in the United States to supply Zelenskiy with arms," Zakharova said.</p>

<p>"Wouldn't it be better for this money to finance the American police and other services that are supposed to ensure law and order within the United States?"</p>

<p>Moscow's invasion of Ukraine in 2022 has brought Russia's ties with the West to their lowest ebb since the height of the Cold War.</p>

<p>Asked whether the Trump attack could affect the legitimacy of the United States' upcoming election, Peskov said: "It is not for us to judge. We have not the slightest desire to interfere. This is a U.S. matter."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A gunman lays on his stomach on a rooftop with a rifle in hand, then screams ring out, a video published by US outlet TMZ on Saturday shows.</p>

<p>US presidential candidate Donald Trump was shot in the ear in an assassination attempt by a gunman at a campaign rally Saturday in Butler, Pennsylvania.</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">?BREAKING: CLEAREST VIDEO OF THOMAS MATTHEW CROOKS SHOOTING AT PRESIDENT TRUMP‼️<br />
<br />
A newly obtained video from TMZ shows the shooter, identified as 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks, firing at former President Donald Trump before being shot. In the background, a woman is heard… <a href="https://t.co/UxQTwPOMIU">pic.twitter.com/UxQTwPOMIU</a></p>

<p>The FBI identified the gunman, who was shot dead by the US Secret Service, as Thomas Matthew Crooks, a 20-year-old from the US state's Bethel Park, according to US media.</p>

<p>The video published by TMZ shows the alleged shooter laying on his belly on a rooftop and aiming a rifle.</p>

<p>"The guy has longer brown hair, and he seems to be wearing a grey shirt/khaki pants -- and as you can see, he's carefully trying to pinpoint a target from afar before pulling the trigger," TMZ reported.</p>

<p>The man is not shown firing in the published footage. But a quick succession of gunshots is heard followed by screams from people off-camera.</p>

<p>"He's turning this way, be careful guys," a man is heard saying.</p>

<p>"Somebody got shot," another voice says. "He's right there, laying down."</p>

<p>"Dude, that's exactly why we need... Trump here," another man is heard saying.</p>

<p>"Secret Service don't (mess) around," another man says.</p>

<p>A second video published by TMZ shows shaky footage of the same rooftop and a blurred body.</p>

<p>"You can see the guy there," a person off-camera says. "I think they hit him because the guy, he looks dead."</p>

<p>Another video posted by a TikTok user shows Trump touching his right ear just after multiple bangs are heard.</p>

<p>In the same frame, a security force sniper, positioned on a roof behind the Republican presidential candidate, is seen taking aim with a rifle mounted on a stand.</p>

<p>AFP did not independently verify the videos, and it is unclear whether the sniper fired the weapon.</p>

<p>Trump then crouches down behind the lectern as Secret Service agents move in around him. Screams are heard in the crowd.</p>

<p>He is later escorted off stage by agents.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump dodged a bullet, literally. The 78-year-old had just started his speech during a Saturday campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania when the shots rang out and <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/video-moment-donald-trump-was-attacked-at-pennsylvania-rally-6100971">one of the bullets grazed his ear.</a></p>

<p>Several video clips showed how Trump was swarmed and covered up by his Secret Service agents moments after the shooting. But now, a slow-motion video establishes how a simple head tilt saved Trump from the assassination attempt. It shows Trump tilting his head just seconds before the shot was fired.</p>

<p>He grabbed his right ear and brought his hand down to look at it before dropping to his knees behind the podium. He emerged about a minute later, his face streaked with blood. Fight! Fight! Fight!" he said, pumping his fist in the air.</p>

<p>One person who attended the rally was killed and two other spectators were critically wounded, the Secret Service said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The attack will likely reshape this year's US presidential race while raising sharp questions about the security provided to the Republican candidate.</p>

<p>Trump left the Butler area under Secret Service protection and later arrived at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey.</p>

<p>He was "doing well" and appeared to have suffered no major injury besides a wound on his upper right ear, the Trump campaign said.</p>

<p>20-year-old <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/fbi-identifies-shooter-in-donald-trump-assassination-attempt-as-20-year-old-thomas-matthew-crooks-news-agency-reuters-6102245#pfrom=home-ndtv_topscroll_Imagetopscroll">Thomas Matthew Crooks</a> has been identified by the FBI as the "subject involved" in what it termed an attempted assassination. He was a registered Republican, according to state voter records. He was shot dead by Secret Service agents after he opened fire from the roof of a building about 140 metres from the stage where Trump was speaking. An AR-15-style semiautomatic rifle was recovered near his body.</p>

<p>"I was shot with a bullet that pierced the upper part of my right ear. "Much bleeding took place," Trump said later on his Truth Social platform following the shooting in Butler, Pennsylvania, about 30 miles (50 km) north of Pittsburgh.</p>

<p>The attack was the first shooting of a US president or major party candidate since the 1981 attempted assassination of Republican President Ronald Reagan.</p>

<p>The shooting occurred less than four months before the November 5 election, when Trump faces an election rematch with Democratic President Joe Biden. Most opinion polls including those by Reuters/Ipsos show the two locked in a close contest.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Four people, including the shooter, died late Saturday when a man opened fire on a birthday party in a village in France, authorities said.</p>

<p>The man approached a neighbouring house where a 20-year-old was celebrating his birthday with his family in Espinasse-Vozelle, a central French village of around 1,000 inhabitants about 60 kilometres (37 miles) north of Clermont-Ferrand.</p>

<p>He fired shots at the party guests, killing three of them, and then himself, the local prefecture said.</p>

<p>The young man celebrating his birthday and his father were both killed.</p>

<p>Police were still piecing together the "how and the why" of the attack, authorities said. The man appears to have shot at passing motorists before the deadly assault.</p>

<p>Jerome Piques, a local prosecutor, told AFP that the man, who was not among the party guests, approached the neighbouring house via a path linking both properties at around 9:30 pm (1930 GMT) before firing his gun loaded with lead bullets.</p>

<p>Four people were in hospital after being wounded in the shooting, but their injuries were not life-threatening, he said.</p>

<p>Fifteen others, who witnessed the shooting, were under observation by psychologists.</p>

<p>"It's a shock," Michel Marien, the mayor of Espinasse-Vozelle, told AFP. "We don't know what triggered this, how a person loses control and does something like this."</p>

<p>Police said the shooter, in his early 50s, appeared to have no prior convictions. The only trace of any irregularity were documents relating to unpaid family support payments, a source close to the case said.</p>

<p>"The exact sequence of events still needs to be checked," the source said.</p>

<p>A large number of police and emergency services were on site Sunday.</p>

<p>Participants at the village's Bastille Day celebration that was going on nearby were not harmed as police cordoned off the area.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a country already on edge, the assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump has enraged his supporters, paused the Democratic campaign, and raised fears of further political violence in the run-up to November's election.</p>

<p>Trump's Republican allies painted him as a hero on Saturday, seizing on the image of him with his ear bloodied and fist raised, appearing to mouth the words "Fight! Fight! Fight!"</p>

<p>Whereas Trump has regularly used violent language with his followers, advisers and allies of the former president flipped the script on his Democratic opponent President Joe Biden, saying it was the demonization of the Republican presidential candidate that led to the assassination attempt.</p>

<p>"Today is not just some isolated incident. The central premise of the Biden campaign is that President Donald Trump is an authoritarian fascist who must be stopped at all costs. That rhetoric led directly to President Trump's attempted assassination," US Senator J.D. Vance of Ohio, a top candidate to be Trump's running mate, said on X.</p>

<p>Biden moved quickly to try to defuse the situation, denouncing the attack as unacceptable political violence and pulling election ads attacking Trump.</p>

<p>"There's no place in America for this kind of violence. It's sick," Biden told reporters.</p>

<p>The motivation of the shooter is not yet known. The suspect, 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks of Bethel Park, Pennsylvania, was a registered Republican, according to state voter records. He previously made a $15 donation to a political action committee that raises money for left-leaning and Democratic politicians.</p>

<p>In the short term, the attack will likely boost Trump's appearances in Milwaukee this week at the Republican National Convention as he accepts his party's presidential nomination, fortifying the sense of grievance and estrangement his supporters already feel toward the nation's political class.</p>

<p>Within hours of the shooting, Trump's campaign sent out a text asking voters to contribute to the campaign. "They're not after me, they're after you," the message read.</p>

<p>Billionaires Elon Musk and Bill Ackman also swiftly endorsed Trump. "I fully endorse President Trump and hope for his rapid recovery," Musk said on X, the social media site he owns.</p>

<p>Chris LaCivita, the co-manager of Trump's campaign, said on X that "for years and even today, leftist activists, Democrat donors and now even Joe Biden have made disgusting remarks and descriptions of shooting Donald Trump ... it's high time they be held accountable for it ... the best way is through the ballot box."</p>

<p>LaCivita was apparently referring to recent remarks by Biden made in the context of asking his supporters to focus on beating Trump rather than his own performance. "So, we're done talking about the debate, it's time to put Trump in a bullseye," said Biden, who has always condemned any political violence.</p>

<p><strong>Political Attacks</strong></p>

<p>The U.S. is grappling with the biggest and most sustained increase in political violence since the 1970s. Of 14 fatal political attacks since supporters of Trump stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, in which the perpetrator or suspect had a clear partisan leaning, 13 were right-wing assailants. One was on the left.</p>

<p>Despite being a former president, Trump has campaigned as an outsider insurgent, complaining that he has long been targeted by the federal "deep state" and Biden's administration to prevent him from reclaiming power.</p>

<p>He has typically employed violent, degrading, and even apocalyptic rhetoric while doing so, warning of a "bloodbath" if he is not elected and saying immigrants in the United States illegally are "poisoning the blood of our country".</p>

<p>Some Republicans were already agitated by his continued stoking of the fire.</p>

<p>"If the country wasn't a powder keg before, it is now," said Chip Felkel, a Republican operative in South Carolina who has opposed Trump.</p>

<p>Brad Bannon, a Democratic strategist, said the shooting could benefit Trump politically because it feeds into his campaign narrative that the country is off-track.</p>

<p>"The attempted assassination creates sympathy for Trump," Bannon said. "It also confirms the idea to voters that something is fundamentally wrong in this nation, which is an idea that drives support for him."</p>

<p>Trump in May was found guilty of engaging in a scheme to cover up an affair with a porn star, a conviction that did little to alter the race and suggested supporters of both sides remain entrenched in their positions.</p>

<p>Biden has dealt with a debate within his own party over whether he should step down as the Democratic candidate because of concerns that he is no longer fit for the job. He says his doctors have told him he is in good shape. Trump has benefited in some polls from Biden's disastrous debate performance last month, but others show the race to be even.</p>

<p>Many voters have already been alienated by both Biden and Trump. The chaos that surrounds the candidates may contribute to voters feeling that the nation's problems are unfixable and the gulf between the parties cannot be bridged.</p>

<p>U.S. Representative Steve Scalise, a Republican who was shot by a gunman in 2017, told Fox News that violent election rhetoric needed to stop.</p>

<p>"All it takes is one person who is just unhinged to hear that and go out and act on it and think that's their signal to go take somebody out," he said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">The final hearing for the case involving zoologist Adam Britton, a British crocodile expert, was adjourned on Thursday after his lawyer produced a fresh report to the judge. The court will now hear the case in August.</p>

<p dir="ltr">As per <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/brit-crocodile-expert-who-raped-33224802">Mirror,</a>&nbsp;Britton –&nbsp; charged with rape, torture and death of dozens of dogs — faces 249 years in prison in Australia.&nbsp; Last year, Britton had pleaded guilty to over 60 charges of animal cruelty.</p>

<p dir="ltr">On Thursday, the NT Supreme Court judge Michael Grant requested his staff and animal rights activists to leave the room before the beginning of the hearing, the report added.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">"In my assessment, the material has the potential to cause nervous shock or some other psychological disturbance," he was quoted as saying by <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-07-11/adam-britton-sentencing-delayed-nt-supreme-court/104084334">ABC</a>. The judge called the offending as “grotesque cruelty to animals".</p>

<p dir="ltr">While people were waiting for the final verdict, his lawyer presented a new report and requested the judge to consider it. The report in question talked about his current state of mind after he took "nearly 30 hours of treatment by a psychologist" in prison, the report added.</p>

<p dir="ltr">“Remorse is considered evidence of rehabilitative prospects, as is insight. Those are things that may not be present the first time that someone speaks to someone in a professional capacity. They are things that often evolve with treatment. They're not fixed in stone," Britton's lawyer was quoted as saying.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Requesting for a reduction in his client's sentence, the lawyer added, “This is a human being who has been afflicted by a condition since very early childhood … It is not his fault. It's of significance, your honour, that this particular condition is exceptionally taboo in most societies, and the court can, I hope, accept that that would have been a very difficult thing to grow up with and learn to manage into adulthood.”</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>What is the case?</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">As per an <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-07-11/adam-britton-sentencing-delayed-nt-supreme-court/104084334">ABC</a> report, he used to torture dogs and beat them to death at his place in Darwin, Australia. He also used to record the act of cruelty.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The report added that Britton had a “torture room” –&nbsp; a shipping container — where he used to sexually assault the dogs.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The shooter was identified as 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks. He has been killed. A spectator was also killed in the shooting and two others were "critically" injured, officials said.</p>

<p>The 78-year-old Republican presidential contender, whose team claimed he was "fine," was attacked shortly as he began his speech.&nbsp; "I knew immediately that something was wrong in that I heard a whizzing sound, shots, and immediately felt the bullet ripping through the skin," Mr Trump said on his Truth Social account.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Wishing former US President Donald Trump a swift recovery after he survived an assassination attempt yesterday, Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma has said right-wing leaders across the globe "are now active targets of the radical left".

<p>"Physical or otherwise, right-wing leaders across the globe are now active targets of the radical left. However, these attacks will not be able to defeat the "nation first" ideology. This is rooted in deep spirituality and inspired by the Sanatan philosophy of 'Janani Janmabhoomi cha Swargadapi Gariyasi'. My best wishes to Donald Trump as he stands strong," Mr Sarma posted on X, adding "StandWithTrump" and "NationFirst" as hashtags.</p>

<p>Republican leader and former US President Trump was injured in an assassination attempt at Pennsylvania's Butler yesterday. One person in the audience was killed, and two others injured as a 20-year-old shooter fired multiple rounds targeting the former US President. The shooter, Thomas Matthew Crooks, was gunned down. Trump has said a bullet pierced the upper part of his right ear.</p>

<p>US President Joe Biden has strongly condemned the incident. White House officials said he has also spoken to Trump, his biggest opponent in the US election due later this year.</p>

<p>"There's no place in America for this kind of violence. It's sick. It's sick. It's one of the reasons why we have to unite this country... We cannot be like this, we cannot condone this," Biden told reporters in an emergency briefing after the attack on Trump.</p>

<p>"The idea that there's political violence, or violence in America like this, is just unheard of. It's just not appropriate. Everybody, everybody must condemn it. Everybody," Biden said.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi has condemned the assassination attempt and said violence has no place in politics and democracies.</p>

<p>"Deeply concerned by the attack on my friend, former President Donald Trump. Strongly condemn the incident. Violence has no place in politics and democracies. Wish him speedy recovery," Prime Minister Modi posted on X.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An Italian sports journalist said on Sunday he would take legal action after being falsely identified on social media as the suspected shooter in an assassination attempt against US presidential candidate Donald Trump.</p>

<p>A message shared widely on the X platform reads: "Per the Butler Police Department the Trump shooter has been arrested at the scene and has been identified as Mark Violets, an Antifa member."</p>

<p>It was accompanied by a picture of Italian journalist Marco Violi. He is the editor of romagiallorossa.it, a fan website for the Italian soccer club AS Roma.</p>

<p>The FBI said early on Sunday it had identified 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks of Bethel Park, Pennsylvania, as the "subject involved" in Saturday's shooting. The Secret Service said the suspect was shot dead by agents.</p>

<p>"I categorically deny that I am involved in this situation," Rome-based Violi wrote in an Instagram story, saying he had been woken up in the middle of the night by Instagram and X notifications related to the post.</p>

<p>Violi blamed two Italian X users for spreading the false information against him, and said that he would go to the police on Monday to report them and the media who picked up on their message.</p>

<p>Calling the X users "stalkers," Violi said he had been their target for years, and that criminal proceedings against them are ongoing. "I kindly ask to be left in peace because I have been a victim of this since 2018," he wrote.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Actor Alec Baldwin has broken his silence following the dismissal of involuntary manslaughter charges against him by a New Mexico judge in connection with the tragic shooting incident on the set of the film 'Rust'.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Actor <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/alec-baldwin-cries-in-court-after-judge-dismisses-rust-shooting-trial-6094839">Alec Baldwin</a> has broken his silence following the dismissal of involuntary manslaughter charges against him by a New Mexico judge in connection with the tragic shooting incident on the set of the film 'Rust'. In a statement obtained by Deadline, Baldwin expressed gratitude amidst a tumultuous legal battle.</p>

<p>"I am grateful for the tremendous support I have received during this challenging time," he said.</p>

<p>He also shared a photo of him taken inside the courtroom on Instagram.</p>

<p>Alongside the picture, he wrote, "There are too many people who have supported me to thank just now. To all of you, you will never know how much I appreciate your kindness toward my family."</p>

<p>The decision, announced on Friday by Judge Marlowe Sommer, not only dismissed the charges against Baldwin but also barred any possibility of retrial, effectively concluding the criminal proceedings against him, according to The Hollywood Reporter.</p>

<p>The ruling followed a day-long hearing filled with heated arguments regarding alleged mishandling of evidence by authorities.</p>

<p>Judge Marlowe Sommer underscored the impact of procedural errors on the fairness of the trial, stating unequivocally, "The late discovery of this evidence has compromised the fundamental fairness of these proceedings. There is no remedy but to dismiss the charges."</p>

<p>During the hearing, the judge personally inspected a bag of ammunition central to the case, which Baldwin's legal team asserted had been withheld from them until recently.</p>

<p>This development triggered significant repercussions, including the resignation of a special prosecutor and the testimony of another, as per The Hollywood Reporter.</p>

<p>Initially projected to span two weeks, the trial abruptly ended on its third day, leaving Baldwin visibly moved but choosing to remain silent as he departed the courthouse.</p>

<p>Prosecutor Kari Morrissey acknowledged the judge's decision while maintaining that there was no conclusive evidence linking the discovered ammunition to the tragic incident involving cinematographer Halyna Hutchins.</p>

<p>The motion for dismissal, filed by Baldwin's defense team, highlighted critical evidence that emerged post-trial of the film's armorer, Hannah Gutierrez-Reed.</p>

<p>This included ammunition allegedly matching the fatal bullet, disclosed belatedly to authorities by retired officer Troy Teske in March but not presented to the defense during trial preparations, according to The Hollywood Reporter.</p>

<p>The fatal incident occurred during a rehearsal at a New Mexico church set, where Baldwin inadvertently discharged a loaded revolver he was assured was unloaded.</p>

<p>The incident resulted in the death of Halyna Hutchins and injured director Joel Souza, sparking widespread scrutiny over safety protocols on film sets.</p>

<p>Legal proceedings against Baldwin have been turbulent, marked by conflicting forensic reports and witness testimonies since charges were first filed in January 2023, dropped, and later reinstated.</p>

<p>Following the dismissal, attorney Brian Panish, representing Matthew Hutchins, Halyna's widower, expressed disappointment while reaffirming their commitment to holding Baldwin accountable.</p>

<p>"We respect the court's decision. We look forward to presenting all the evidence to a jury and holding Mr. Baldwin accountable for his actions in the senseless death of Halyna Hutchins," Panish stated in an official statement obtained by The Hollywood Reporter.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The FBI identified 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks of Bethel Park, Pennsylvania as the suspect in Saturday's attempted assassination of former US President Donald Trump at a campaign rally. The suspect was shot and killed by the Secret Service seconds after he allegedly fired shots toward a stage where Trump and was speaking in Butler, Pennsylvania. The FBI said it was working to determine a motive for the attack, in which one rally attendee died and two other spectators were critically injured. Trump was shot in the ear.</p>

<p>State voter records show that Crooks was a registered Republican. The upcoming Nov. 5 election would have been the first time Crooks had been old enough to vote in a presidential race.</p>

<p>Crooks lived about an hour away from where the shooting took place in Butler. The Federal Aviation Administration said on Sunday that it closed the airspace over Bethel Park for "special security reasons."</p>

<p>When Crooks was 17 he made a $15 donation to ActBlue, a political action committee that raises money for left-leaning and Democratic politicians, according to a 2021 Federal Election Commission filing. The donation was earmarked for the Progressive Turnout Project, a national group that rallies Democrats to vote. The groups did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.</p>

<p>Crooks' father, Matthew Crooks, 53, told CNN that he was trying to figure out what happened and would wait until he spoke to law enforcement before speaking about his son.</p>

<p>Thomas Crooks graduated in 2022 from Bethel Park High School, according to the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review. He received a $500 "star award" from the National Math and Science Initiative, according to the newspaper.</p>

<p>A 2022 graduation ceremony video cited by the New York Times shows Crooks receiving his high school diploma to some applause. Video from that ceremony posted online shows Crooks with glasses in a black graduation gown and posing with a school official. Reuters could not immediately verify the authenticity of the video. Law enforcement officials said on Saturday that Crooks carried no identification to the site of the shooting and had to be identified using other methods.</p>

<p>"We're looking at photographs right now and we're trying to run his DNA and get biometric confirmation," Kevin Rojek, FBI special agent in charge, said during a press briefing.</p>

<p>USA Today reported that dozens of law enforcement vehicles were stationed outside a residence listed at the address on Crooks' voter registration record. Agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives were on the scene and a bomb squad was at the residence, USA Today reported. The perimeter of the residence of the suspect was guarded on Sunday by yellow police caution tape. An Alleghany County Police vehicle was parked outside.</p>

<p>"It's insanity that anyone would do this," Dan Maloney, a 30-year-old resident from the area was quoted as saying by USA Today.Reuters could not immediately identify social media accounts or other online postings by Crooks. Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, did not immediately respond to questions on whether the platforms had removed any accounts related to the suspect.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Indian-American entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy today condemned the attack on former US President <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/fbi-identifies-shooter-in-donald-trump-assassination-attempt-as-20-year-old-thomas-matthew-crooks-news-agency-reuters-6102245#pfrom=home-ndtv_topscroll" target="_blank">Donald Trump</a>, who got hit on his ear during an attempt on his life at an election rally in Butler, Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>"We believe the fact that Trump is safe right now is nothing short of an act of God," Ramaswamy, who challenged the 78-year-old politician for the Republican presidential nomination at the primaries, wrote in a long post on X.</p>

<p>"My heart tells me God intervened not just for Trump, but for our nation.</p>

<p>"Today, the future survival of the United States of America came down to less than a hair's width in the path of a bullet," Ramaswamy said.</p>

<p>He continued his praise for <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/bullet-pierced-upper-part-of-my-right-ear-donald-trump-on-shooting-at-rally-6101088#pfrom=home-ndtv_topscroll" target="_blank">Trump</a> and said Americans just had the chance to see "our next President's true character, unvarnished".&nbsp;</p>

<p>"He took the fire, he took the hit, he felt the blood, and then he stood right back up for the people he was put here to lead," Ramaswamy added.</p>

<p>He, however, attacked US President Joe Biden and said, "First they sued him. Then they prosecuted him. Then they tried to take him off the ballot. The only thing more tragic than what just happened is that, if we're being honest, it wasn't totally a shock.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Biden's inevitable ritual condemnation of political violence today (when it comes) will be insufficient and irrelevant. No amount of verbiage today changes the toxic national climate that led to this tragedy," he said.</p>

<p>Regardless of who you vote for, let's unite around the truth that what happened today is "unacceptable, now and forever", he said.</p>

<p>His long post drew a reaction from billionaire <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/donald-trump-rally-shooting-elon-musk-fully-endorses-donald-trump-after-rally-shooting-6101736" target="_blank">Elon Musk</a>, who earlier reacted to the shocking shooting by quickly endorsing Trump.</p>

<p>"You very much predicted this," Musk said. "I badly hoped I would be wrong," Ramaswamy responded.</p>

<p>Trump had just started speaking at the packed outdoor election rally in Butler town when bullets started flying.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Video footage showed him grabbing his ear as shots were fired. With his face streaked with blood, Trump was quickly rescued by the US Secret Service agents.</p>

<p>Shortly after the incident, he said, "I was shot with a bullet that pierced the upper part of my right ear."</p>

<p>The attacker, identified as 20-year-old <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/donald-trump-rally-shooting-who-was-thomas-matthew-crooks-man-who-tried-to-assassinate-donald-trump-6102487#pfrom=home-ndtv_topstories" target="_blank">Thomas Matthew Crooks</a> of Bethel Park, Pennsylvania, was also shot and killed by a member of the Secret Service.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Italy's parliament made it illegal on Wednesday for couples to go abroad to have a baby via surrogacy -- a pet project of Prime Minister's Giorgia Meloni party which activists say is meant to target same-sex partners.</p>

<p>Since taking office in 2022 Meloni has pursued a highly conservative social agenda, looking to promote what she sees as traditional family values, making it progressively harder for LGBTQ couples to become legal parents.</p>

<p>The upper house Senate voted into law a bill proposed by Meloni's Brothers of Italy party by 84 votes to 58. The bill was already approved by the lower house last year.</p>

<p>The legislation extends a surrogacy ban already in place in Italy since 2004 to those who go to countries such as the United States or Canada, where it is legal, imposing jail terms of up to two years and fines of up to 1 million euros ($1.09 million).</p>

<p>"Motherhood is absolutely unique, it absolutely cannot be surrogated, and it is the foundation of our civilisation," Brothers of Italy senator Lavinia Mennuni said during the parliamentary debate.</p>

<p>"We want to uproot the phenomenon of surrogacy tourism."</p>

<p>Earlier this year, Meloni called surrogacy an 'inhuman' practice that treated children as supermarket products, echoing a position expressed by the Catholic Church.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, demonstrators gathered near the Senate voicing their outrage at the bill, saying the government was lashing out at LGBTQ people and damaging those who wanted to have children despite the fact Italy has a sharply declining birth rate.</p>

<p>"If someone has a baby, they should be given a medal. Here instead you are sent to jail... if you don't have children in the traditional way," Franco Grillini, a long-time activist for LGBTQ rights in Italy, told Reuters at the demonstration.</p>

<p>Rainbow Families President Alessia Crocini said 90% of Italians who choose surrogacy are heterosexual couples but they mostly do so in secret, meaning the new ban would de facto affect only gay couples who cannot hide it.</p>

<p>The clampdown on surrogacy comes against the backdrop of falling birthrates, with national statistics institute ISTAT saying in March that births had dropped to a record low in 2023 -- the 15th consecutive annual decline.</p>

<p>"This is a monstrous law. No country in the world has such a thing," said Grillini, referring to the government's move to prevent Italians from taking advantage of practices that are perfectly legal in some countries.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[In addition to military pressure, China is reportedly using hackers and celebrities to undermine Taiwan's commitment to self-rule.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few days ago, Taiwan detected a record 153 Chinese military aircraft flying over the self-ruled island following a day of large-scale drills. The aircraft were seen on Tuesday (2200 GMT Monday), the defence ministry said in a statement, the most in a single day.</p>

<p>Beijing deployed fighter jets, drones, warships, and coast guard boats to encircle Taiwan on Monday, with Taiwan responding by dispatching "appropriate forces" and placing its outlying islands on heightened alert. Taiwan condemned China's actions as "irrational and provocative," and the US called them "unwarranted."</p>

<p>Now, in addition to military pressure, China has now adopted a new tactic by employing hackers and celebrities to influence public opinion in Taiwan and undermine its commitment to self-rule, according to the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.wsj.com/world/asia/china-employs-hackers-and-celebrities-to-undermine-taiwan-435a3fd5"><em>Wall Street Journal </em></a>report.</p>

<p>As per the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.wsj.com/world/asia/china-employs-hackers-and-celebrities-to-undermine-taiwan-435a3fd5"><em>WSJ report,</em></a> more than 90,000 cyberattack attempts on Taiwan were detected in August, with targets including government infrastructure. It was the highest number since a surge two years earlier during a controversial visit to the island by then-US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.</p>

<p>Taiwan officials say China has gone so far as to enlist Taiwanese celebrities in its cause.</p>

<p>"One of the ways they do this is by inviting well-known Taiwanese figures-whether they're from the arts, entertainment, or politics-to share pro-unification views," said Tsai Ming-yen, the head of Taiwan's National Security Bureau, after some celebrities posted maps of the Monday drills and expressed support for Beijing's "One China" policy.</p>

<p>According to a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.wsj.com/world/asia/china-employs-hackers-and-celebrities-to-undermine-taiwan-435a3fd5"><em>WSJ report,</em></a> officials in Taiwan say China's media campaign includes spreading disinformation designed to weaken U.S. confidence in the island's ability to defend itself. One message that circulated online during Monday's drills alleged that a Taiwanese naval captain had been drinking all night on Sunday. The investigation bureau of Taiwan's Justice Ministry said the claim was false.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Music mogul Sean “Diddy” Combs, who is in federal custody following multiple charges of racketeering and sex trafficking, has now been accused of raping a woman as "payback" after she suggested his involvement in rapper Tupac Shakur's murder. The woman, in her lawsuit filed in California on Tuesday, claimed that Combs even threatened to slash her face with a knife over the comments, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y5m53g1ejo">BBC</a> reported.</p>

<p>In her lawsuit, the woman claimed she came on Combs' radar after meeting one of his friends at a bar in 2018. At the venue, the person was "attempting to impress" people by reportedly making video calls to Combs. But the woman refrained from taking part because she believed Combs "had something to do with" Shakur's murder.</p>

<p>She claimed he overheard her comment at the bar and said she would have to "pay" for it. Nearly a month later, Combs' friend asked her to help with his cancer drugs and she later visited him at his residence. However, the music mogul unexpectedly turned up there and then approached her with a knife. Holding it on the right side of her face, he threatened her to give a "'Glasgow smile' in retaliation for her previous statements".<br />
<br />
He tore her clothes and "violently" raped her using a TV remote control, as per the court documents. Further, she stated that Combs told her that her life was in his hands and that she would never be seen again if he wished.</p>

<p>This didn't stop there. The woman claimed she was raped by multiple people until she "had no control over her body nor could she move her body".</p>

<p>Eventually, when she tried to escape, the woman got confronted by Combs, who allegedly offered her money to mention that whatever happened was consensual and she was not raped. When he ran towards the neighbours' houses to seek help, gunshots were fired towards her, the lawsuit states.</p>

<p>Since the neighbours had already called the police after hearing the disturbance next door, the woman said she informed the Contra Costa Sheriff's Department how she was gang-raped by Combs and others. However, she alleged that no further action was taken in this matter.<br />
<br />
Three weeks after the incident, she went to the hospital where the staff called police officials. The victim said none of her reports led to any investigation.</p>

<p>Besides Combs, she sued six other people over sexual assault, kidnapping, and false imprisonment and is demanding a trial in the case.</p>

<p>Combs has denied all the charges against him. He earlier claimed that he did not have any involvement in the shooting incident that took the life of Shakur in Las Vegas in 1996. The case remains a mystery to date. However, a person named Duane "Keffe D" Davis -- a former gang member -- was charged with the murder in 2023. Previously, Davis alleged that he was offered $1 million by Combs for a hit on the late rapper.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>After generating days of excitement in the media, the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit finally concluded with External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar making a quick visit to Islamabad. For all the speculation about India and Pakistan, in the end, what the 23rd meeting of the Council of Heads of Government (CHG) of the SCO will likely be remembered for is perhaps Jaishankar's sunglasses. In this age of intense social media scrutiny, a small clip, now viral, of Jaishankar sporting his sunglasses in style became symbolic of India's confidence in dealing with Pakistan. Hilarious though this might seem, all that is left of Pakistan in Indian foreign policy imagination today is decoding our diplomats' style and body language.</p>

<p>But, of course, in sending Jaishankar to Islamabad for the SCO summit, New Delhi was also sending out a message about keeping its engagement with its SCO partners intact. Last year, when Bilawal Bhutto Zardari visited Goa to participate in the SCO meeting, he became the first Pakistani foreign minister to visit India since 2011. And now, Jaishankar was the first Indian foreign minister to visit Pakistan in around a decade. These visits though were largely inconsequential in the wider scheme of bilateral ties between the two neighbours.</p>

<h2><strong>Terrorism Continues To Upset Things</strong></h2>

<p>Established in 2001 and including Russia, China, India, Pakistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Iran, the SCO is a Eurasian grouping that started out as a platform to deal with regional security challenges like extremism and terrorism. It later expanded to facilitating trade and investment and strengthening economic ties.</p>

<p>Since its inception, the SCO has prioritised the fight against terrorism, separatism, and extremism, as stated in Article 1 of its charter. India has focused on eliminating terrorism and terrorist groups along its northwest border while also promoting connectivity and socio-economic development across Eurasia. However, despite the SCO's goals, some member states have leveraged terrorism as an instrument of foreign policy, exacerbating tensions in Eurasia and against India.</p>

<p>Shifting geopolitical interests among the member countries have hindered the SCO's effectiveness in tackling state-sponsored terrorism. New Delhi has consistently advocated for greater cooperation on counterterrorism and has raised concerns about state-sponsored terrorism, particularly regarding Pakistan-based groups. But this has seen limited success. Furthermore, the differing views on achieving a peaceful, prosperous, and stable Afghanistan underscore the challenges faced by this Eurasian organisation, as member states often prioritise their own interests over a collective vision for peace in the region.</p>

<h2><strong>The 'Three Evils'</strong></h2>

<p>At the meeting in Islamabad, Jaishankar reminded the SCO about its original mandate and the need to adhere to the fundamentals. "It is axiomatic that development and growth require peace and stability. And as the Charter spelt out, this means being firm and uncompromising in countering the 'three evils'. If activities across borders are characterised by terrorism, extremism and separatism, they are hardly likely to encourage trade, energy flows, connectivity and people-to-people exchanges in parallel," Jaishankar underlined for the gathering.</p>

<p>If Pakistan was the target above, China was also not spared when he stated, "...Cooperation must be based on mutual respect and sovereign equality, recognise territorial integrity and sovereignty and be built on genuine partnerships, not unilateral agendas. SCO cannot progress if we cherry-pick global practices, especially of trade and transit." In line with its stated policy, India refused to endorse China's "One Belt One Road" initiative, thereby standing out in the SCO, where other members reaffirmed their support for China's connectivity initiative.</p>

<h2><strong>SCO Meet Was About Central Asia, Not Pakistan</strong></h2>

<p>Challenges from Pakistan and China notwithstanding, Central Asia remains an important foreign policy priority for India. Jaishankar's visit to Islamabad was a testament to that. Since becoming a full member in 2017, India has prioritised combating terrorism, and it continues to advocate for stronger counterterrorism measures and greater cooperation among member states to address this pressing issue. India's approach also focuses on connectivity and socio-economic development across Eurasia, aligning with its broader foreign policy objectives. Initiatives like the International North-South Transport Corridor and the Chabahar Port project demonstrate New Delhi's commitment to enhancing trade and connectivity within the region.</p>

<p>But the relationship with Pakistan is unlikely to change any time soon. It was only months back that Jaishankar had declared that the "era of uninterrupted dialogue" with Pakistan was over. "Actions have consequences, and as far as Jammu and Kashmir is concerned, Article 370 is done [away with]. The issue now is what kind of relationship we can contemplate with Pakistan. We are not passive; whether events take a positive or negative direction, we will react," he had suggested. For the Modi government, there is neither any incentive nor any interlocutor on the other side to merit a change in its approach. By visiting Islamabad, Jaishankar was signalling to the SCO members that New Delhi remains committed to the regional grouping despite the challenges it faces within. Pakistan was merely a sideshow.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The pattern of domestic airlines receiving bomb threats to their flights continued for the fourth day as two international flights, one each of Vistara and IndiGo, were targeted in the similar manner on Thursday.</p>

<p>Earlier on Wednesday, seven flights of IndiGo, SpiceJet and Akasa received similar bomb threats.</p>

<p>Prior to that, nearly a dozen flights operated by Indian carriers received similar threats on Monday and Tuesday.</p>

<p>On Thursday a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/vistara-frankfurt-mumbai-flight-makes-emergency-landing-after-bomb-threat-6808170">Mumbai-bound Vistara flight</a> with 147 persons on board was immediately taken to security checks on its arrival from Frankfurt following the Boeing 787 aircraft receiving a bomb threat, according to the airline.</p>

<p>At the same time, an IndiGo flight operating from Istanbul in Turkiye for Mumbai also received a bomb threat and was taken to an isolation bay here for the security agencies to carry out a comprehensive security check.</p>

<p>"The Vistara flight UK 028 operating from Frankfurt to Mumbai on October 16, 2024 was subject to a security threat received on social media," the airline said.</p>

<p>As per the protocol, all relevant authorities were immediately informed, it said, adding the aircraft safely landed at the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport, Mumbai.</p>

<p>"It was taken to the isolation bay where all customers were disembarked. We are fully cooperating with the security agencies to complete the mandatory security checks," Vistara said in the statement.</p>

<p>There were 134 passengers and 13 crew on board the aircraft, a source said.</p>

<p>The aircraft, which departed for Mumbai from Frankfurt on Wednesday at 8.20 pm (local time), made an emergency landing here at around 7.45 am on Thursday, the source said.</p>

<p>IndiGo in a statement said, "Flight 6E 18, operating from Istanbul to Mumbai, received a security-related alert. Upon landing, the aircraft was isolated, and all passengers were safely disembarked." The airline worked closely with the relevant authorities, and standard operating procedures were followed, it said.</p>

<p>IndiGo, however, did not share other details.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cricket featured as a talking point between S Jaishankar and his Pakistani counterpart Ishaq Dar during an official lunch hosted by Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif in Islamabad, sources said.</p>

<p>Mr Jaishankar and Mr Dar, who sat next to each other during the lunch, held only informal talks over cricket and there was no formal discussion over resumption of cricketing ties, sources added. This was the first direct conversation since 2015 between the two countries' foreign ministers.</p>

<p>Pakistan Cricket Board chief Mohsin Naqvi was also present at the dinner meet, sources said.</p>

<p>While the exact content of the talks is not known, sources said that Pakistan wants India to send its team for the ICC Champions Trophy, set to be hosted by the neighbouring nation next February. Top officials of the England and Wales Cricket Board had recently told the PCB that organising the Champions Trophy without India will be meaningless since it will impact the ICC's revenue.</p>

<p>India has not played any match in Pakistan since the 2008 Asia Cup due to tensions between the two countries arising out of the Mumbai terror attacks. Pakistan has made three tours to India since 2008 but India hasn't sent its team to Pakistan due to security concerns.</p>

<p>Mr Jaishankar was in Islamabad for the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) meeting of Heads of Governments, which marked the first Pakistan visit by an Indian foreign minister since 2015.</p>

<p>During his visit, Mr Jaishankar met Prime Minister Sharif at the multilateral event but did not hold any bilateral with Pakistan. Mr Jaishankar had clarified that India-Pakistan ties won't feature during his Islamabad visit since it was for the SCO summit.</p>

<p>At the SCO summit, he delivered a strong and veiled message aimed at Pakistan, stating that cooperation in areas like trade is unlikely to flourish if cross-border activities are characterised by terrorism.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Bangladeshi court on Thursday ordered an arrest warrant for exiled ex-leader Sheikh Hasina, who fled to India in August after she was toppled from power by a student-led revolution.</p>

<p>"The court has... ordered the arrest of former prime minister Sheikh Hasina and to produce her in court on November 18," Mohammad Tajul Islam, chief prosecutor of Bangladesh's International Crimes Tribunal, told reporters on Thursday.</p>

<p>Hasina's 15-year rule saw widespread human rights <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/bangladesh-violence-quota-protests-5-more-murder-cases-filed-against-sheikh-hasina-total-cases-now-71-report-6430267">abuses</a>, including the mass detention and extrajudicial killings of her political opponents.</p>

<p>"Sheikh Hasina was at the helm of those who committed massacres, killings and crimes against humanity from July to August", Islam said, calling it a "remarkable day".</p>

<p>Hasina, 77, has not been seen in public since fleeing Bangladesh, and her last official whereabouts are at a military airbase near India's capital New Delhi.</p>

<p>Her presence in India has infuriated Bangladesh.</p>

<p>Dhaka has revoked her diplomatic passport, and the countries have a bilateral extradition treaty which would permit her to return to face criminal trial.</p>

<p>A clause in the treaty, however, says extradition might be refused if the offence is of a "political character".</p>

<p>Hasina's government created the deeply contentious ICT in 2010 to probe atrocities during the 1971 independence war from Pakistan.</p>

<p>The United Nations and rights groups criticised its procedural shortcomings, and it became widely seen as a means for Hasina to eliminate political opponents.</p>

<p>Several cases accusing Hasina of orchestrating the "mass murder" of protesters are being probed by the court.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump on Wednesday stood by debunked claims that immigrants in Ohio were eating pets, telling Latino voters during a town hall he was "just saying what was reported."</p>

<p>Trump in recent weeks has amplified a false claim that has gone viral that Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, were stealing residents' pets or taking wildlife from parks for food.</p>

<p>There have been no credible reports of Haitians eating pets, and officials in Ohio - including Republicans - have repeatedly said the story is untrue.</p>

<p>At a town hall hosted by Univision, an undecided Latino Republican voter from Arizona, a battleground state, asked Trump whether he truly believed that immigrants were eating pets.</p>

<p>"I was just saying what was reported. All I do is report," Trump replied during the event held in Miami. "I was there, I'm going to be there and we're going to take a look."</p>

<p>Trump added that "newspapers" had also reported on the claim, without naming any or providing any details.</p>

<p>Trump, who has not yet travelled to Springfield, has previously said he would conduct mass deportations of Haitian immigrants from the Ohio city, even though the majority of them are in the US legally.</p>

<p>The city has faced bomb threats since Trump began repeating the false accusations about Haitians.</p>

<p>In the final weeks before the Nov. 5 election, Trump is increasingly resorting to darker and more violent language about illegal immigration, an issue that opinion polls show resonates with many voters, especially Republicans.</p>

<p>He is competing against Democrat Kamala Harris for key votes from the growing Latino population. Latino voters have typically backed Democrats, but the Trump campaign is hoping to win over more Latino voters, especially men, on the back of economic discontent.</p>

<p>Harris led Trump by eight percentage points - 47% to 39% - among Hispanic voters in Reuters/Ipsos polling conducted between Sept. 11 and Oct. 7.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Texas pardons board rejected a clemency appeal on Wednesday from an autistic man on death row whose murder conviction was based on what his lawyers say was a misdiagnosis of "shaken baby syndrome."</p>

<p>Robert Roberson, 57, is scheduled to die by lethal injection at the state penitentiary in Huntsville on Thursday for the February 2002 death of his two-year-old daughter, Nikki.</p>

<p>The Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles took up Roberson's case on Wednesday and declined by a 6-0 vote to recommend that Texas Governor Greg Abbott grant clemency.</p>

<p>Abbott is unable to grant clemency without a recommendation from the board, but he can grant a 30-day reprieve of Roberson's death sentence.</p>

<p>Gretchen Sween, one of Roberson's attorneys, urged the governor to grant the reprieve "so we can continue to pursue Mr Roberson's innocence claim."</p>

<p>"We pray that Governor Abbott does everything in his power to prevent the tragic, irreversible mistake of executing an innocent man," Sween said.</p>

<p>Roberson's case has drawn the attention of the Innocence Project, which works to reverse wrongful convictions, as well as best-selling American novelist John Grisham, Texas lawmakers and medical experts.</p>

<p>Also among those seeking to halt his execution is the man who put him behind bars -- Brian Wharton, the former chief detective in the town of Palestine.</p>

<p>"Knowing everything that I know now, I am firmly convinced that Robert is an innocent man," Wharton said at a recent press conference organized by Roberson's supporters. "The system failed Robert."</p>

<p>Grisham, author of the legal thrillers "The Firm" and "A Time to Kill," also appeared at the event and said: "What's amazing about Robert's case is that there was no crime."</p>

<p>Roberson's lawyers say the diagnosis of shaken baby syndrome, made at the hospital where his chronically ill daughter died, was erroneous and the cause of death was in fact pneumonia, which was aggravated when doctors prescribed improper medication.</p>

<p>Sween, Roberson's attorney, said there is "overwhelming new medical and scientific evidence" that shows that the little girl died of "natural and accidental causes, not abuse."</p>

<p>According to his lawyers, Roberson would be the first person executed in the United States based on a conviction of shaken baby syndrome.</p>

<h3><strong>'Unscientific'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>According to Kate Judson of the Center for Integrity in Forensic Sciences, more than 30 parents and caregivers in 18 US states have been exonerated after being wrongfully convicted using "unscientific" shaken baby testimony.</p>

<p>Sween said Roberson's autism spectrum disorder, which was not diagnosed until 2018, contributed to his arrest and conviction.</p>

<p>"It is quite possible that Mr Roberson would not be on death row today, but for his autism," she said.</p>

<p>Sween said staff at the hospital where his daughter was admitted did not know he had autism and "judged his flat affect as a sign of guilt."</p>

<p>A bipartisan group of 86 Texas state lawmakers has also urged clemency for Roberson, citing the "voluminous new scientific evidence" that casts doubt on his guilt.</p>

<p>There have been 19 executions in the United States this year.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United States launched a series of airstrikes on Wednesday evening targeting key underground weapons storage facilities controlled by Iran-backed <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/houthis-saudi-arabia-israel-explained-who-are-houthis-the-group-that-hijacked-an-india-bound-ship-4588672">Houthi rebels</a> in Yemen. The strikes, carried out by B-2 Spirit stealth bombers, marked the first-ever use of these advanced aircraft against Houthi targets since the beginning of US involvement in the Yemen conflict.</p>

<p>The US Department of Defense confirmed that five Houthi weapons storage sites, deeply buried underground, were struck in the mission. According to US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, these facilities housed advanced conventional weapons used by the Houthis to threaten civilian and military vessels operating in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden.</p>

<h3><strong>Deployment Of B-2 Bombers</strong></h3>

<p>The B-2 Spirit bomber, known for its stealth capabilities and heavy payload, is capable of delivering a far greater volume of ordnance compared to fighter jets. The B-2 offers the US military an unparalleled ability to strike high-value targets that are either deeply fortified or well-concealed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mr Austin explained that the strikes were authorised at the direction of President Joe Biden. "This was a unique demonstration of the United States' ability to target facilities that our adversaries seek to keep out of reach, no matter how deeply buried or fortified," Mr Austin stated.</p>

<h3><strong>Growing Regional Tensions</strong></h3>

<p>The timing of the strikes comes amid heightened tensions in the Middle East, with US allies, particularly Israel, facing ongoing threats from Iran and its various regional proxies. The Houthis, operating from Yemen, have consistently launched attacks on commercial shipping and military vessels, disrupting one of the world's most critical maritime trade routes. In recent months, these attacks have escalated, with the group claiming responsibility for launching ballistic and cruise missiles as well as drones against US Navy ships and international vessels.</p>

<p>The Houthis' activities in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, targeting vessels with weaponry that originated from these underground storage sites, have raised alarms about the security of global trade routes and the potential for environmental catastrophes. In August, a Greek-flagged vessel came under attack, leading to an oil spill and serious environmental concerns.</p>

<p>In September, the Houthis escalated their campaign, launching approximately two dozen ballistic and cruise missiles, as well as drones, aimed at three US Navy destroyers. Although none of these missiles struck their targets, the attacks prompted increased military activity from US forces in the region.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Houthi Attacks Tied To Regional Conflicts</strong></h3>

<p>The Iran-backed Houthis have framed their actions as part of a broader alignment with groups like Hamas and Hezbollah, who are actively engaged in ongoing conflicts with Israel. Following an attempted missile strike deep inside Israel in September, the Houthis have openly declared their support for these groups. While the missile ultimately fragmented in mid-air and caused no injuries, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned the Houthis would "pay a heavy price" for their actions. In retaliation, Israeli airstrikes targeted Houthi positions in Yemen shortly after the incident.</p>

<p>In the following weeks, the Houthis have continued launching missiles and drones toward Israel, further complicating the regional security landscape. These actions, combined with continued Houthi assaults on international shipping, have drawn significant military responses from the United States and its allies.</p>

<p>Wednesday's strike on Houthi facilities adds to a series of US military actions aimed at curbing the Houthis' growing arsenal and degrading their operational capabilities. US Central Command (CENTCOM) confirmed that there were no immediate civilian casualties from the latest strikes. Over the past year, the US has increased its military presence in the region, including the deployment of advanced naval assets such as carrier strike groups, amphibious ready groups, and guided missile destroyers, along with air support in the form of fighter jets and attack aircraft.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>More than one billion people are living in acute poverty across the globe, a UN Development Program report said Thursday, with children accounting for over half of those affected.</p>

<p>The paper published with the Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative (OPHI) highlighted that poverty rates were three times higher in countries at war, as 2023 saw the most conflicts around the world since the Second World War.</p>

<p>The UNDP and the OPHI have published their Multidimensional Poverty Index annually since 2010, harvesting data from 112 countries with a combined population of 6.3 billion people.</p>

<p>It uses indicators such as a lack of adequate housing, sanitation, electricity, cooking fuel, nutrition and school attendance.</p>

<p>"The 2024 MPI paints a sobering picture: 1.1 billion people endure multidimensional poverty, of which 455 million live in the shadow of conflict," said Yanchun Zhang, chief statistician at the UNDP.</p>

<p>"For the poor in conflict-affected countries, the struggle for basic needs is a far harsher and more desperate battle," Zhang told AFP.</p>

<p>The report echoed last year's findings that 1.1 billion out of 6.1 billion people across 110 countries were facing extreme multidimensional poverty.</p>

<p>Thursday's paper showed that some 584 million people under 18 were experiencing extreme poverty, accounting for 27.9 percent of children worldwide, compared with 13.5 percent of adults.</p>

<p>It also showed that 83.2 percent of the world's poorest people live in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia.</p>

<p>Sabina Alkire, director of the OPHI, told AFP that conflicts were hindering efforts for poverty reduction.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"At some level, these findings are intuitive. But what shocked us was the sheer magnitude of people who are struggling to live a decent life and at the same time fearing for their safety –- 455 million," she said.</p>

<p>"This points to a stark but unavoidable challenge to the international community to both zero in on poverty reduction and foster peace, so that any ensuing peace actually endures," Alkire added.</p>

<p>India was the country with the largest number of people in extreme poverty, which impacts 234 million of its 1.4 billion population.</p>

<p>It was followed by Pakistan, Ethiopia, Nigeria and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The five countries accounted for nearly half of the 1.1 billion poor people.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The World Health Organization (WHO) urged Israel to grant access to Gaza, where escalating violence has blocked humanitarian missions from delivering critical food and medical supplies.</p>

<p>Amid the chaos, WHO and its partners launched the second round of a polio vaccination campaign on Monday, aiming to immunise over half a million children, Xinhua news agency reported.</p>

<p>"The total number of children who received a second dose of polio vaccine in Gaza after two days of vaccination is 156,943," WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus wrote on X on Wednesday.</p>

<p></p>

<p>However, ongoing violence threatens the campaign's goal of vaccinating at least 90 per cent of the children, a critical target to halt the virus's spread. In addition to polio vaccines, children are receiving vitamin A supplements to strengthen their immunity.</p>

<p>WHO highlighted the severity of the situation, reporting that out of 54 scheduled United Nations missions to Gaza in October, only one has been completed, with the rest either cancelled or obstructed due to the conflict.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>"We're not so different, you and I. We've both spent our lives looking for the weakness in one another's systems. Don't you think it's time to recognize there is as little worth on your side as there is on mine?"</p>

<p>Those who've been rooting for Gary Oldman playing Jackson Lamb, the instantly unlikeable boss of the good-for-nothings of MI5, the British intelligence agency, in Apple's <em>Slow Horses</em>, may not even remember this line the actor delivered playing another spy boss in another spy thriller: as George Smiley in<em> Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy,</em> a 2011 film based on John la Carre's book.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Addressed to Smiley's Russian counterpart, Karla, this line, emblematic of the film's politics, was celebrated and decried in equal measure for creating an equivalence between the US and the USSR during the Cold War. Going by the recent media stories and diplomatic activity, George Smiley could have very well said it about India and Canada today.</p>

<h2><strong>Blow Hot, Blow Cold</strong></h2>

<p>New Delhi and Ottawa have expelled each other's top diplomats, following the Canadian Prime Minister's latest accusation of the Indian establishment being directly involved in the assassination of a Sikh separatist on Canadian soil. India, on the other hand, has not only denied it but also mounted a counterattack on Canada for nurturing anti-India groups within its territory.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Fall is not fair weather for India-Canada relations. Exactly one year ago, the two countries were engaged in similar diplomatic acrimony over the same assassination. Khalistan, after nuclear proliferation, has been their proverbial bee in the bonnet for several decades. With the exception of the lull during the turn of the millennium, the issue has stayed alive and volatile. It is not going anywhere in a hurry.</p>

<p>Canada's soft approach towards anti-India outfits was once attributed solely to its domestic politics: the country is home to the largest Sikh diaspora, with around 7,70,000 of them living there. The current strain in the relationship, however, may not just be about Canada's vote bank politics or India's internal affairs involving resistance from a sect of Sikhs. There is, quite clearly, an emergence of bilateral antagonism now. Are the rapprochement personnel doing their job well? Or, more provocatively, are the spies doing theirs?</p>

<h2><strong>Flashbacks From 1975</strong></h2>

<p>Realistically speaking, assassinations on foreign soil are not a no-go zone, even with declared enemies, if the assassins are smart. The morality and legality of such actions is another story. What, then, has compelled Canada, a limited ally, to make public its investigations in the Nijjar assassination case and hold India responsible? Has there been a slight or a breach of trust, intended or otherwise, behind the scenes that a public show is to be put up? Are there bad-faith actors at work on either side, or is it sheer incompetence? It could be either or both, but as venerable Canadian writer Margaret Atwood reminds us, "Stupidity is the same as evil if you judge by the results". Therefore, it's the breakdown of bilateral ties that matters, much more than the nitty-gritty of what caused it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This escalation of diplomatic tensions between India and Canada is beginning to loosely resemble another controversial diplomatic event that occurred half a century ago: the breakdown of the then newly forged Australia-North Korea relations. On October 30, 1975, Pyongyang recalled its diplomats from Canberra, citing the host country's 'unfriendly attitude' and 'intolerable provocative acts' in a communication sent via commercial mail. Less than ten days later, Australian diplomats were ousted from Pyongyang on November 8 on account of 'unfriendly behaviour' and 'abuse of diplomatic immunity'.</p>

<p>The actors and the times are different, but the problem is the same. This inability to smoothen out the rough edges time and again reflects poorly on the political and diplomatic leaders of India and Canada. What are long bilateral ties worth if they cannot withstand such events? Both Ottawa and New Delhi have engaged in the game of provocation and reconciliation. The classic blow-hot, blow-cold approach. To what end, though?&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>A Lesson From<em> Bridge Of Spies</em></strong></h2>

<p>Coming back to George Smiley's wisdom, looking for weaknesses in the other is a zero-sum game. This isn't the Cold War yet, but as India grows in stature, the chances of this game intensifying will increase correspondingly. India and Canada are not directly engaged in any military-territorial jostling, so these flare-ups have an even more limited scope. Both are citing long-term national security concerns, and other countries like the UK and the US are trying to broker 'peace' by urging India to cooperate in the investigation.</p>

<p>Diplomacy is an exercise in sifting fact from fiction but addressing both because both matter, even if unequally. Another popular culture reference to demonstrate it comes from <em>Bridge of Spies</em>, a 2014 film about the famous spy exchange between the US and USSR. James Donovan (Tom Hanks), a lawyer representing a Russian spy called Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance), tells him, "The case against you matters. Making them prove it matters. The fiction is: whether you did it or not doesn't matter. The state has to prove it, that you're a spy".</p>

<p>Before anyone condescends about taking lessons from fiction, remember, apart from John la Carre, celebrated writers like Ian Fleming and Graham Greene once served in MI6.&nbsp;</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Relatives of Lyle and Erik Menendez on Wednesday pleaded for the release of the long-imprisoned brothers as US prosecutors review new evidence concerning the infamous 1989 murder of their parents.</p>

<p>The grisly shotgun slayings of wealthy music mogul Jose Menendez and his wife Kitty in their Beverly Hills home -- and their sons' subsequent, televised murder trials -- became the subject of a media frenzy. A hit Netflix series has recently sparked fresh interest in the case.</p>

<p>The brothers, aged 21 and 18 at the time of the murders, tearfully testified they killed their parents for fear of their own lives after years of sexual abuse by their father.&nbsp;</p>

<p>They were convicted of first-degree murder and have been serving life sentences in prison without possibility of parole since their sentencing in 1996.</p>

<p>"As details of Lyle and Eric's abuse came to light, it became clear that their actions, while tragic, were the desperate response of two boys trying to survive the unspeakable cruel(ty) of their father," their 92-year-old aunt Joan VanderMolen said Wednesday.</p>

<p>"Lyle and Erik have already paid a heavy price, discarded by a system that failed to recognize their pain," she told a news conference attended by some 30 relatives.</p>

<p>Their initial trial, starting in 1993, was one of the first televised murder cases to make daily headlines around the world. It ended in a mistrial due to a deadlocked jury, but they were found guilty in a second trial.</p>

<p>Prosecutors argued they conspired to murder their parents in order to inherit their $14 million fortune.</p>

<p>Last year, the brothers' attorneys filed a court petition setting out new evidence which they said demonstrates Jose Menendez's history of sexual abuse.</p>

<p>Among the new evidence is a letter Erik wrote to a cousin months before the murders, saying "I've been trying to avoid dad. It's still happening... Every night I stay up thinking he might come in."</p>

<p>Former Latino boy band member Roy Rossello said in a documentary series released last year that he was drugged and raped by Jose Menendez in the 1980s.</p>

<p>The brothers' attorneys have called for a resentencing, which could see their clients released from prison given the lengthy time already spent behind bars.</p>

<p>Prosecutors said in a statement Wednesday that Los Angeles's criminal justice system "has developed a more modern understanding of sexual violence since the Menendez brothers first faced prosecution."&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Today, our office acknowledges that sexual violence is a pervasive issue affecting countless individuals -- of all gender identities," they wrote, confirming the case is being reviewed on multiple fronts.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, Los Angeles district attorney George Gascon told reporters he had "a moral and an ethical obligation to review what is being presented to us."</p>

<p>His comments came two weeks after the release on Netflix of the crime drama "Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story." The streaming giant also put out a documentary film, "The Menendez Brothers," last week.</p>

<p>Gascon, who is running for re-election on a criminal reform platform, acknowledged the initial Netflix show resulted in a large number of calls to his office about the case.</p>

<p>A hearing is scheduled for November 26.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On the eve of King Charles III's landmark tour Down Under, many of his antipodean subjects are unaware or uninterested -- a sign, experts say, of a more diverse and less Anglo-centric Australia.</p>

<p>There is no red-white-and-blue bunting around Sydney Harbour, no posters on the city's streets and aside from cries from ardent monarchists and republicans, little chatter about the first visit of a sitting Australian monarch in 13 years.</p>

<p>"I'd forgotten they were even coming," said 73-year-old Sydneysider Trevor Reeves summing up the mood in Australia's largest city.</p>

<p>This six-day royal visit to Sydney and Canberra will undoubtedly bring pomp, ceremony and plenty of media coverage.</p>

<p>Even with the schedule skimmed back because of Charles' cancer diagnosis, there will be extravagant mass gatherings, including an event in front of the Opera House and a sprawling community barbecue.</p>

<p>But few expect Charles and Camilla's visit to match the buzz of nation-stopping royal visits past -- including Charles and his first wife Diana's trip in 1983.</p>

<p>Today Aussies appear more preoccupied with war in the Middle East, the US election, or another group of British visitors -- rock group Oasis -- who will tour next year.</p>

<p>"I'm not excited, but I don't begrudge them coming out," said 72-year-old Susanne Lowire. "They don't have much impact over here."</p>

<p>"Some people just love it as they love movie stars," said Lowire, likening the royals to musical brothers Liam and Noel Gallagher.</p>

<p>"Are they going to fight again? Do they sound terrible? It's the same with the king and the queen coming over," she said.</p>

<p>University of Sydney historian Cindy McCreery believes the lack of attention being paid to the royal visit is understandable amid worries about war, climate change and the cost of living.</p>

<p>"We live in a complex moment with all the global issues," she said. It is "natural to expect a more varied response to the monarchy".&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, decades-long demographic trends are also shaping perceptions.</p>

<h3><strong>A changing nation</strong>&nbsp;</h3>

<p>About 36 per cent of Australians still identify as "English", the country's largest ancestry, according to a 2021 census.</p>

<p>That figure was 10 points higher when the census first asked that question in 1986.</p>

<p>About a third of Australians today were born overseas, and the population is steadily becoming more Italian, Greek, Lebanese, Indian or Chinese.</p>

<p>"That impacts how Australians connect or do not connect," McCreery said.</p>

<p>"In previous royal visits, people may have had a stronger connection to Britain, but a growing number of people may not necessarily have that immediate connection."</p>

<p>Polls show about a third of Australians would like to ditch the monarchy, a third would keep it, and a third are ambivalent.</p>

<p>So no sweeping constitutional change is on the cards, and the issue is a political dead rubber.</p>

<p>While Australia voted against becoming a republic in 1999, the movement remains active, but in political purgatory.</p>

<p>Australia's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese is a lifelong Republican and even created a minister for the republic when he came to office.</p>

<p>The post was quietly scrapped earlier this year and Albanese, having heavily lost a referendum on Indigenous rights, has ruled out going back to the voters about the royals.</p>

<h3><strong>Royal collectors&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>The royals are not without Australian fans.</p>

<p>Still, even Jan Hugo, one of the largest royal memorabilia collectors in the Southern Hemisphere, will not travel two hours to Sydney to see the king and queen, when they visit.</p>

<p>Her home in rural New South Wales could be mistaken for a museum. Every corner is bursting with more than 10,000 pieces of royal memorabilia.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hugo admits she has given up counting how many items she has.</p>

<p>"It's probably worth a fortune to me and nothing to somebody else," she said.</p>

<p>It all started 40 years ago when she was given a commemorative coin for the engagement of Charles and Diana.</p>

<p>Now, most of Hugo's home is dedicated to the royal family, with unusual trinkets lining the walls.</p>

<p>A large statue of Queen Elizabeth II sits on a throne surrounded by her beloved corgis.</p>

<p>Hugo said the republic debate rears its head every time the royals visit, but whatever Australia decides she just hopes to get her hands on some memorabilia.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A new report calls for urgent action to conserve resources and protect ecosystems critical to maintaining the global freshwater supply.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For the first time in recorded human history, the global water cycle is under severe stress due to a combination of human activity and climate change, according to a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://economicsofwater.watercommission.org/report/executive-summary-economics-of-water.pdf" rel="nofollow,noindex">new report</a> published by the Global Commission on the Economics of Water, a group of international leaders and experts.<br />
<br />
The report says that decades of collective mismanagement and undervaluation of water around the world have damaged freshwater and land ecosystems and allowed for the continuing contamination of water resources. "We can no longer count on freshwater availability for our collective future," it added.<br />
<br />
Johan Rockstrom, co-chair of the commission and one of the authors, said, “For the first time in human history, we are pushing the global water cycle out of balance. Precipitation, the source of all freshwater, can no longer be relied upon.”<br />
<br />
The water cycle, the natural process through which water moves between the earth and the atmosphere, is essential for life on the planet. It involves the evaporation of water from the ground and other bodies, rising to form clouds and eventually falling to earth as rain or snow. However, disruptions to this delicate balance are already being felt around the globe.<br />
<br />
“Nearly 3 billion people and more than half of the world's food production are now in areas where total water storage is projected to decline,” stated the report, adding that the situation will worsen significantly. It warns that more than 50% of the world's food production is at risk, and economic damage could see countries losing an average of 8% of their GDP by 2050, with poorer nations potentially facing losses of up to 15%.<br />
<br />
The report distinguishes between “blue water,” or the liquid found in lakes, rivers and underground aquifers, and “green water,” which is moisture held within plants and soils. Although blue water has traditionally been the focus of water management efforts, the report stresses that green water is equally critical, as it contributes to about half of all rainfall on land through the process of plant transpiration.<br />
<br />
In addition to these concerns, the report underlines that water cycle disruptions are tightly linked to the accelerating climate crisis. The loss of ecosystems like wetlands and forests, which act as carbon sinks, is contributing to further warming of the planet. This, in turn, leads to drier landscapes and a greater risk of fires, perpetuating the cycle of environmental degradation.<br />
<br />
One of the most alarming statistics highlighted by the commission is the sheer volume of water required for human well-being. The report estimates that people need around 4,000 litres of water per day to maintain a “dignified life,” far exceeding the 50 to 100 litres deemed necessary for basic survival by the United Nations.<br />
<br />
The severity of the situation was echoed by Richard Allan, a climate science professor from the University of Reading, who told CNN that the report painted “a grim picture of human-caused disruption to the global water cycle, the most precious natural resource that ultimately sustains our livelihoods.”<br />
<br />
One of the key recommendations of the report is to reform the economic approach to water, urging governments to implement policies that promote sustainable use. This includes better pricing strategies that reflect water scarcity and discourage wasteful practices, such as growing water-intensive crops in drought-prone areas or establishing data centres in regions already facing water stress.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lifeguards declared Sydney's famed Bondi beach and several other strands closed Thursday, as more mysterious black "tar ball" globules washed up along the city's shores.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For days, thousands of black spheres -- ranging from the size of peas to tennis balls -- have appeared on the sand, puzzling locals and tourists alike.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Chemical testing has identified them as hydrocarbon-based tar balls, local officials said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Tar balls can form when slicks of spilled oil are battered by wind and waves, mixing to form a sticky seawater emulsion that eventually breaks into smaller pieces or "balls". &nbsp;</p>

<p>The source is still unknown.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"As a precaution, all Waverley Beaches will be closed until further investigation has been carried out," a local council that includes Bondi said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The mayor of another beachside council, Dylan Parker, said three other beaches were also closed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Our beaches will remain closed and we are investigating," he said. "We are still waiting for the tides to come in."&nbsp;</p>

<p>While formally closed, access to the beaches has not been forcibly restricted, so some brave surfers and swimmers could still be seen in the water.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is common for authorities to declare beaches closed during large swells.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 69-year-old American man died when his home was destroyed by fire. According to <em>The New York Post,</em> an e-scooter in the Brooklyn apartment caught fire due to a faulty lithium-ion battery.</p>

<p>The massive fire that killed the old man and injured two others broke out inside the second-floor apartment on Brighton 3rd Street near Brightwater Court in Brighton Beach. The flames and the heat created by it were so intense that it blocked the exit from the house, resulting in the death of the 69-year-old, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/10/16/us-news/e-scooter-sparks-deadly-nyc-fire-killing-69-year-old-resident-trapped-in-his-apartment-fdny/?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=nypost&amp;utm_source=twitter"><em>as per the news report.</em></a></p>

<p>A 32-year-old woman and 35-year-old man who were also home at the time were hospitalised after they tried to douse the flames-aa risky move when dealing with a battery fire, according to Flynn and police.</p>

<p>"So they attempted to extinguish the fire [and] they were able to escape with minor injuries," FDNY Chief Fire Marshal Daniel Flynn said. "There were two children as well that self-evacuated and did not sustain injuries.</p>

<p>"I strongly recommend you do not attempt to extinguish these on your own," the FDNY official added. "Your conventional fire extinguishers will really not be as effective as they would be in other fires."</p>

<p>A dozen FDNY units, including 60 firefighters and EMS workers, responded to the scene.</p>

<p>"When lithium-ion batteries ignite, it's a much more serious, much more involved fire," FDNY Chief of Department John Esposito said. "Thankfully, our firefighters were quickly able to stretch hose lines and extinguish the fire before it spread to additional apartments and throughout."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[While Israel's plans for retaliation are not directly tied to the upcoming election, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is reportedly aware of the potential impact on American politics. ]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>American officials expect Israel to retaliate against Iran before the November 5 Presidential polls in the United States, <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/10/16/politics/israel-iran-conflict-election-day/index.html ">CNN</a> has learnt from sources. It comes after Iran launched at least 200 ballistic missiles targeting Israel earlier this month. The Iranian aerial attack came after Israel targeted Southern Lebanon, killing nearly 2,500 people,&nbsp;including some key Hezbollah leaders.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
<br />
While Israel's plans for retaliation are not directly tied to the upcoming election, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is reportedly aware of the potential impact on American politics. The growing unrest in the Middle East is adding further complexities to Vice-President Kamala Harris' campaign. Their handling of Israel's year-long war in Gaza has drawn sharp criticism from both sides of the political spectrum. Progressives demand stronger humanitarian efforts in Gaza, while Republicans accuse the administration of failing to manage the situation effectively.<br />
<br />
The Biden administration has recently intensified its calls for Israel to improve humanitarian conditions in Gaza. In a letter from Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, the US warned that continued military assistance could be at risk if Israel failed to increase aid to Gaza. The letter, however, lacked Biden or Harris's signatures.<br />
<br />
The deadline for Israel to meet humanitarian benchmarks extends beyond the election. Meanwhile, the US has bolstered Israel's defences with an advanced air defence system called THAAD.<br />
<br />
For Biden and Harris, the timing of Israel's counter-strike could pose significant challenges, particularly in key swing states like Michigan, home to a large Arab-American community. As the election nears, Harris has been campaigning in the state where the Israeli war has become a sensitive topic. Biden has urged Israel to avoid targeting Iran's nuclear or oil sites, but Netanyahu said that Israel will act based on its national interests. Some US officials believe Netanyahu's actions could impact the election, possibly helping former President and Republican candidate Donald Trump, though there is no direct evidence.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The US remains focused on preventing a larger regional war. While it is unclear how Israel will attack, both military and cyber options are possible.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Ahead of the iPhone 16 series launch, a throwback video of Apple CEO Tim Cook has gone viral on social media where he addresses the common misconceptions about why the US-based company invested in China for manufacturing of its products.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Apple, the Cupertino tech giant, relies on the vast manufacturing network in China for the mass production of its iPhone and other devices. In recent times, the company has also shifted focus to other key markets, including India, to diversify its manufacturing base.<br />
<br />
Now, days ahead of the highly-anticipated launch of the iPhone 16 series, an old video of Apple CEO Tim Cook has gained significant attention on social media. In the viral video, Cook is seen addressing the common misconception about why the US-based company has invested heavily in China for its product manufacturing.<br />
<br />
Debunking the common belief that companies flock to China for cheap labour, Mr Cook said, "There is a confusion about China. And let me at least give you my opinion. The popular conception is that companies come to China because of low labour costs. I am not sure what part of China they go to, but the truth is China stopped being a low labour cost country many years ago."<br />
<br />
The Apple CEO elaborated on the advanced tooling and precision required to produce the products and highlighted China's vocational expertise in these areas.<br />
<br />
"The reason is because of the skill, the quantity of skill in one location, and the type of skill it is," he said.<br />
<br />
Mr Cook noted that the product it makes requires "really advanced tooling and the precision that you have to have in tooling and working with the materials that we do are state of the art."&nbsp;<br />
<br />
"And the tooling skill is very deep here. You know, in the US, you could have a meeting of tooling engineers, and I am not sure we could fill the room. In China, you could fill multiple football fields. It's that vocational expertise is very, very deep here," he added.<br />
<br />
The throwback clip of Tim Cook was shared on social media site X and has garnered six million views so far. It also caught the attention of Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, who agreed with his views.<br />
<br />
In the comments section, Mr Musk wrote, "True".</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p><br />
Mr Musk's comment on the Chinese manufacturing sector came just months after his surprise visit to the Asian country where he plans to introduce Tesla's self-driving technology to a market with ferocious competition.<br />
<br />
On his trip, he met with Chinese Premier Li Qiang, who praised Tesla as a “successful model” for US-China collaboration.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Apple is currently gearing up for its mega event, 'It's Glowtime'. The tech giant will roll out its all-new iPhone 16 series, besides setting the stage for a new artificial intelligence platform.<br />
<br />
The event will take place at 10:30 PM on September 9 in India.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A gunman crossing from Jordan killed three Israeli civilians at the Allenby Bridge border in the occupied West Bank before security forces shot him dead on Sunday, Israeli authorities said. It was the first attack of its kind along the border with Jordan since October 7, when Palestinian group Hamas carried out an assault on southern Israel, sparking the war in Gaza that has since escalated throughout the region.</p>

<p>The attack took place in a commercial cargo area under Israeli control where Jordanian trucks offload cargo entering the West Bank, officials said. The crossing, also known as the King Hussein Bridge, lies about midway between Amman and Jerusalem just north of the Dead Sea.</p>

<p>"A terrorist approached the area of the Allenby Bridge from Jordan in a truck, exited the truck, and opened fire at the Israeli security forces operating at the bridge," the Israeli military said.</p>

<p>"The terrorist was eliminated by the security forces, and three Israeli civilians were pronounced dead as a result of the attack," it said.</p>

<p>Jordan was investigating the shooting and a Jordanian official said the crossing has been closed.</p>

<p>The Israeli manager of the crossing said three workers were shot dead at close range by the driver crossing from Jordan.</p>

<p>Israel and Jordan signed a peace treaty in 1994 and have close security ties. Dozens of trailers cross daily from Jordan, with goods from Jordan and the Gulf that supply both the West Bank and Israeli markets.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>"India and the GCC enjoy a deep and multifaceted relationship, in areas including political, trade &amp; investment, energy cooperation, cultural and people - to - people ties. The GCC region has emerged as a major trading partner for India and is home to a large Indian expatriate community, numbering around 8.9 million. The Foreign Ministers meeting will be an opportunity to review and deepen institutional cooperation between India and the GCC across various sectors," the MEA said.</p>

<p>Mr Jaishankar will thereafter visit Berlin, Germany, for a two-day trip from September 10 to 11. This will be his third visit as Minister to Berlin. "Both India and Germany share a robust Strategic Partnership and Germany is one of India's prominent trading partners and among the largest Foreign Direct Investors," the MEA said.</p>

<p>He will also travel to Geneva, Switzerland for an official visit from September 12 to 13. During the visit, he will meet heads and representatives of international organisations with whom India is actively engaged.</p>

<p>Notably, the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi, Sheikh Khaled bin Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, will come to India for a two-day official visit from September 9 to 10. The Crown Prince will meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi to hold discussions on bilateral cooperation.</p>

<p>Mr Jaishankar on Friday spoke about revitalising the connections between India and the Mediterranean region.</p>

<p>"It is vital that as we move forward, we embrace this collaborative spirit, uphold open communication, and commit to shared goals. Together we can address today's challenges, unlock new opportunities and build a resilient and connected future," he said at the CII India Mediterranean Business Conclave.</p>

<p>He underscored the need for strengthening security and defence cooperation between India and the Mediterranean region, given the high volatility and uncertainty in the global economy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Mediterranean region has a vast green hydrogen and green ammonia potential. Highlighting this, Mr Jaishankar talked about energy cooperation as another important dimension of collaboration.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The 14-year-old student who shot dead two students and two teachers at his school in US' Georgia had sent an apology text to his mother before he opened fire, his grandfather told the New York Post.</p>

<p>The text prompted frantic calls by the mother to the school in an apparent bid to stop the tragedy, he said.</p>

<p>Charles Polhamus said his daughter Marcee Gray was at his house when she received a text from her son Colt Gray. "I'm sorry, mom," it read.</p>

<p>After she read the message, she made desperate calls to the school, trying to warn them of an "extreme emergency," her relative told The Washington Post.</p>

<p>"I was the one that notified the school counselor at the high school. I told them it was an extreme emergency and for them to go immediately and find [my son] to check on him," she had told her sister.</p>

<p>Fearing the worst, she began driving to the school and was half way there when she learned that four people had been killed, her father said.</p>

<p>"It's horrible. It's absolutely horrible," Marcee told The New York Post.</p>

<p>After receiving her panicked call, the school authorities tried to avert the disaster. A school official also went to Colt's classroom but he entered minutes after he had left the room.</p>

<p>Both Colt and his father are now facing charges of murder in connection to the shooting. Authorities said the father gifted him the AR-15-style rifle used in the shooting as a Christmas gift.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The virus was first identified in a 61-year-old patient in Jinzhou city in June 2019, who fell ill five days after being bitten by ticks in Inner Mongolia's wetlands]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A new virus, dubbed wetland virus (WELV), has been discovered in China that can spread to humans through tick bites, causing neurological disease in some cases, according to media reports.</p>

<p>The virus was first identified in a 61-year-old patient in Jinzhou city in June 2019, who fell ill five days after being bitten by ticks in Inner Mongolia's wetlands. The patient experienced fever, headache and vomiting, with symptoms resistant to antibiotics, according to a report published in <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2313722" rel="nofollow,noindex">The New England Journal of Medicine</a>.</p>

<p>WELV belongs to a group of viruses known for being transmitted by ticks, similar to the Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus, which can cause severe illness in humans. Following the initial discovery, researchers conducted a thorough investigation in northern China, where they collected nearly 14,600 ticks from various locations. About 2 per cent of these tested positive for WELV genetic material, primarily from the species Haemaphysalis concinna.</p>

<p>WELV RNA was also found in sheep, horses, pigs and rodents called Transbaikal zokor. The virus showed cytopathic effects in human umbilical-vein endothelial cells and caused lethal infections in animal models.</p>

<p>The researchers also analysed blood samples from forest rangers in the region, finding antibodies to WELV in 12 out of 640 individuals. Further tests on patients with tick bites revealed that 20 individuals tested positive for the virus, with symptoms ranging from fever, dizziness and headache to nausea and diarrhoea. One patient even fell into a coma due to high white blood cell counts in the brain and spinal fluid.</p>

<p>Although all patients recovered after treatment, lab experiments on mice showed that WELV can cause lethal infections and potentially affect the nervous system. This suggests that while WELV can be mild in some cases, it has the potential to cause severe health issues, particularly involving the brain.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The Duke of Sussex will be eligible to receive a substantial sum on September 15 from a trust established by Queen Elizabeth.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prince Harry is reportedly set to receive millions from the late Queen Mother on his 40th birthday next week, according to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/harry-charles-meghan-william-royal-family-latest-news-b2608721.html?page=3" rel="noindex, nofollow"><em>The Independent</em></a>. The media outlet states that the Duke of Sussex will be eligible to receive a substantial sum on September 15 from a trust established by Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother when he was ten years old.</p>

<p>At that time, the Queen Mother, who was then 94, is said to have set aside a tax-free $40.4 million for her great-grandchildren, as reported by <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.thetimes.com/uk/royal-family/article/prince-harry-to-get-millions-from-queen-mother-on-40th-birthday-mcvqt339f" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>The Times</em></a>.</p>

<p>The newspaper further explains that the inheritances were divided into two instalments-one to be given to Princes William and Harry when they turned 21, and another on their 40th birthdays.</p>

<p>A former palace aide told The Times: "There was a trust fund set up at the time. It was a way for the Queen Mother to set aside money for her great-grandchildren when they were older, and a way of passing a portion of her estate down in a tax-efficient manner. It allowed some of her estate to be safeguarded for them."</p>

<p>Sources suggest that Harry may have received a larger portion of the inheritance than his older brother William, 42. Insiders believe this is because the Queen Mother anticipated that William, as Britain's future heir, would inherit a more substantial fortune from the Duchy of Cornwall.</p>

<p>William became Duke of Cornwall when he was named Prince of Wales after King Charles' coronation, inheriting an estimated $50.2 million from the estate.</p>

<p>When the Queen Mother passed away in 2002 at the age of 101, Buckingham Palace released a statement saying, "Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother has bequeathed her entire estate (which mainly comprises the contents of her houses) to the Queen."</p>

<p>"In her will, she requested that the Queen make certain bequests to members of her staff, and these bequests will be subject to inheritance tax as usual. The Queen has decided that the most important of Queen Elizabeth's pictures and works of art should be transferred to the Royal Collection."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Volcanoes were erupting on the Moon as recently as 120 million years ago, evidence collected by a Chinese spacecraft suggests. Until the last few years, scientists had thought volcanic activity ended on the Moon around 2 billion years ago.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="theconversation-article-title">Volcanoes were erupting on the Moon as recently as 120 million years ago, evidence collected by a Chinese spacecraft suggests. Until the last few years, scientists had thought volcanic activity ended on the Moon around 2 billion years ago.</p>

<div class="theconversation-article-body">
<p>The findings, <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adk6635">published in Science</a>, come from analysis of lunar rock and soil delivered to Earth by China's Chang'e 5 spacecraft in 2020. While these results are difficult to reconcile with the accepted history of lunar volcanism, it's possible some areas of the Moon's interior were more enriched in radioactive elements that generate the heat that drives volcanic activity.</p>

<p>The region where Chang'e 5 landed, called Oceanus Procellarum, may be one such area where rocks were enriched in these heat-producing elements.</p>

<p>Volcanism is a major way in which all rocky planetary bodies <a href="https://www.lpi.usra.edu/education/explore/shaping_the_planets/volcanism/">lose their heat</a>. The rocky bodies in our Solar System are Earth, Venus, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter's satellite Io, and Earth's satellite, the Moon.</p>

<p>All available evidence suggests that Venus is <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-024-02272-1">currently volcanically active</a>. On Mars, we can date the ages of formation of large lava flows by counting the numbers of impact craters on these flows.</p>

<p>This crater-counting technique relies on the fact that craters form randomly and uniformly across planetary surfaces, so highly cratered terrains are considered older. The results suggest that Mars, which is half the size of Earth, is volcanically active <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/17545">every few million years</a>.</p>

<p>This is expected, because larger bodies conserve heat better than smaller ones. On this basis Mercury, which is a third of Earth's size, and our Moon, a quarter the size of Earth, should have been volcanically dead for about 2 billion years.</p>

<p>The same should be true of Io, which is similar in size to our Moon. However, tidal forces generated by gravitational interactions with Jupiter give Io an additional, strong heat source. Io is very volcanically active as a result.</p>

<h2>The Moon's dark areas</h2>

<p>Most eruptions on the Moon took place near the edges of giant depressions formed early in the Moon's history by asteroid impacts. Lava flooded the interiors of these basins <a href="https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/gsabulletin/article-abstract/80/5/735/6545/Origin-of-Lunar-Maria">to form the dark areas</a> on the Moon's near side. These areas are call maria (singular mare), the Latin for seas, because the flat sheets of lava were mistaken for expanses of water by early observers.</p>

<p>Analyses of the composition and age of samples returned from these mare areas by the six Apollo missions and three Soviet robotic probes were consistent with the belief there had been no geologically recent volcanic activity on the Moon.</p>

<p>This understanding persisted until very high-resolution images of the lunar surface from the US <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/mission/lro/">Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter mission</a> became available following the mission's launch in 2009. Counts of the numbers of very small impact craters revealed a lack of craters in some volcanic areas with unusual surface textures, named <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2019JE006362">irregular mare patches (IMPs)</a>.</p>

<p>The simplest explanation for this was that these IMPs were young, typically about 100 million years old. This is 20 times younger than the 2 billion-year youngest age that had been expected.</p>

<p>In an attempt to reconcile these observations with the accepted history of lunar volcanism, it was pointed out that the lack of any atmosphere on the Moon would make eruptions there significantly different from those on Earth. The lack of confining pressure would have allowed erupting lavas to release almost all of the gaseous compounds dissolved in them, allowing some lava flows to contain very large numbers of gas bubbles – <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0377027316303705">to the extent of being a foam</a>.</p>

<p>Meteoroid impacts into this soft foam would produce much smaller craters than in solid rock, thus causing the crater-counting method to give ages that were too young.</p>

<p>This issue has seen much debate, and the best way to resolve it is the return of samples to Earth for detailed laboratory analysis. Chang'e 5 brought back samples from a very large lava flow which was already known, from crater-counting, to be relatively young in geological terms.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-04100-2">Initial analyses</a> of many fragments of the lava were consistent with the long-accepted theory that lunar volcanism stopped 2 billion years ago. However, closer examination of the Chinese samples, as described in the new <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adk6635">Science paper</a>, focused on some of the smallest fragments – the majority from rock shattered and melted into droplets by meteoroid impacts.</p>

<p>Three of these 3,000 droplets were identified from their detailed chemistry as volcanic in origin, and are only 120 million years old – very similar to the young ages inferred for IMPs elsewhere on the Moon.</p>

<h2>Lunar eruptions</h2>

<p>Lunar eruptions should have involved high lava fountains like those commonly seen erupting in Hawaii, for example. While most of these droplets would have accumulated into lava flows, some would have been thrown out for tens of kilometres to other parts of the Moon's surface.</p>

<p>The three “volcanic droplets” identified in the Chang'e 5 sample were probably not erupted from the same vent as the bulk of the rock and soil delivered to Earth. This would explain why these droplets are much younger than the lava flow at Chang'e 5's landing site.</p>

<p>These three glassy droplets are the first physical evidence we have for anomalously recent volcanic activity on the Moon. There would have to have been much higher concentrations of heat-producing radioactive elements in some areas than others for volcanic activity to have occurred as recently as the new results imply. So, these findings could prompt a major revision in our understanding of how the Moon developed.<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi's historic visit to Ukraine, India finds itself in a position to play peacemaker in the years-long Russia-Ukraine war. National Security Adviser Ajit Doval will be travelling to Moscow this week to hold crucial discussions in this regard.</p>

<p>In July, PM Modi had also travelled to Russia on an official visit and held detailed discussions with Russian President Vladimir Putin.</p>

<p>India, because of its independent foreign policy, finds itself in a unique position to be able to broker peace between Russia and Ukraine. With Europe and its western allies (NATO allies) finding themselves in a stalemate with Russia, backed by China, India, which has maintained friendly ties with most nations, opens a thrid axis in a largely bipolar world.</p>

<p>"We (India) are not neutral. From the very beginning, we have taken sides. And we have chosen the side of peace. We have come from the land of Buddha where there is no place for war," PM Modi had said during his recent visit to Ukraine.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">

<p class="ins_instory_dv_caption">PM Modi was received warmly both by Putin and Zelenskyy during his recent visits to Russia and Ukraine.</p>
</div>

<p>In his talks with Mr Zelensky that took place under the shadow of the conflict, PM Modi said India is ever ready to play an "active role" in every effort to restore peace in Ukraine and he would even like to contribute personally in ending the conflict.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Modi, who had already visited Russia earlier, followed up his Ukraine visit with a phone call to President Putin. "Spoke with President Putin today," he had written on social media site X on August 27, adding that the two leaders "Exchanged perspectives on the Russia-Ukraine conflict and my insights from the recent visit to Ukraine. Reiterated India's firm commitment to support an early, abiding and peaceful resolution of the conflict."</p>

<p>Earlier, PM Modi's Office in the joint India-Ukraine statement said both leaders reiterated their readiness for further cooperation in upholding principles of international law, including the UN Charter.</p>

<p>While Russia had described PM Modi's visit as "historic, game-changing", Ukraine too had called the Prime Minister's visit "historic", saying India is "key" in the global diplomatic efforts to end the war. The United States too, praised India's efforts, with President Biden saying, "I spoke with Prime Minister Modi to discuss his recent trip to Poland and Ukraine, and commended him for his message of peace and ongoing humanitarian support for Ukraine."</p>

<p><strong>NSA AJIT DOVAL'S RUSSIA VISIT</strong></p>

<p>National Security Adviser Ajit Doval's visit to Moscow comes days after PM Modi's visit to Kyiv where he spoke with President Zelenskyy, and subsequent phone calls with both Russian President Vladimir Putin and his US President Joe Biden.</p>

<p>During the PM's phone call with President Putin, the leaders decided that Ajit Doval would visit Moscow for peace talks, sources said. No other details regarding the schedule of this visit is known yet.</p>

<p>Speaking about the phone call, the Russian Embassy said, "Vladimir Putin shared his principled assessment of the destructive policies of the Kiev authorities and their Western patrons, and went on to highlight Russia's approaches to resolving this conflict."</p>

<p>Sources also said that Mr Doval will be carrying PM Modi's peace plan which he will deliver to President Putin and discuss in detail with top Kremlin officials.</p>

<p>President Putin's phone call with PM Modi and now a visit by Ajit Doval indicates that Russia is open to peace talks, signalling the end of the years-long war. President Putin had said earlier that, "We (Russia) seek negotiations based on agreed documents, not on fleeting demands (by Ukraine)."</p>

<p><strong>INDIA'S RISING ROLE IN GLOBAL DIPLOMACY</strong></p>

<p>Calling India a "Major geopolitical actor" in a recent interview to NDTV, former United Nations Security Council chief and ex-Singapore diplomat Kishore Mahbubani said, "How many leaders in the world can comfortably visit both Russia and Ukraine and be received warmly by both countries. Very few countries in the world. And the fact that Prime Minister Modi can do that is a sign of how India has arrived as a major geopolitical actor."</p>

<p>Itaian PM Georgia Meloni said on Saturday that <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/india-can-help-resolve-russia-ukraine-conflict-italian-pm-giorgia-meloni-6514363" target="_blank">India can help resolve</a> the Russia-Ukraine conflict.</p>

<p>The White House too described PM Modi's visits to Russia and then Ukraine as "potentially helpful."</p>

<p>The ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine began on February 24, 2022.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[A six-year-old girl from UK has climbed a 13,600-foot mountain to raise money for the hospital that saved her life as a baby.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A six-year-old girl from the UK has climbed a 13,600-foot mountain to raise money for the hospital that saved her life as a baby.</p>

<p>A resident of Wales, Seren Price, became the youngest person to climb Mount Toubkal in the Atlas Mountains in Morocco.</p>

<p>The six-year-old now plans to climb Mont Blanc, the highest mountain in Western Europe, in an effort to raise money for Birmingham Children's Hospital.</p>

<p>Seren said that when she was a baby she had a "lump in my neck" and the hospital helped treat her condition which is why she is now raising money for it. Her father said the hospital saved her life when she was young as she was born prematurely with a haemangioma on her neck that affected her breathing.</p>

<p>Seren and her father Glyn Price flew to Morocco in August. With their guide, they walked for eight hours to Mount Toubkal base camp even as temperatures topped 40 degrees.</p>

<p>Mr Price said they reached the summit the next day. "It was a tough hike with narrow paths on slippy vertical scree," he told BBC.</p>

<p>"The heat was the biggest challenge... but once we got to the top it was brilliant. There were about 20 people there who had followed her story on social media, and they were giving her a big round of applause," he added.</p>

<p>On her training for the daunting climb, Seren confidently said she trained only for a week, her father laughed and corrected her saying it was much longer than that.</p>

<p>The father-daughter duo had been training for about a year which also included nighttime walks in a nearby national park. "We were able to replicate some of the tracks. Obviously, the weather wasn't the same, but the terrain was," Mr Price said.</p>

<p>This is not the first time the young mountaineer has broken a record. In 2022, she became the youngest person to complete the UK's three peaks challenge -- climbing the three highest peaks of Scotland, England and Wales -- in under 48 hours.</p>

<p>Now, the young climber has her eyes set on Mount Blac which she says she is excited to scale to "see the snow".</p>

<p>Mr Price, who also has a son said one cannot force children's passions. "I have a boy and I've tried to take him up the mountains, he's not interested - but Seren loves it."</p>

<p>When asked what makes her love climbing, Seren said: "I like spending time with my dad - and seeing the nice things when I'm at the top of the mountain."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The Iran-backed Hezbollah has exchanged near-daily fire with Israeli forces in support of ally Hamas since the group's October 7 attack on Israel.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hezbollah fighters in Lebanon and Israeli forces traded cross-border attacks, both sides said early Sunday, a day after the Lebanese health ministry reported three rescuers killed in an Israeli attack.</p>

<p>The Iran-backed Lebanese movement has exchanged near-daily fire with Israeli forces in support of ally Hamas since the Palestinian group's October 7 attack on Israel triggered the war in the Gaza Strip, with repeated escalations during 11 months of the cross-border violence.</p>

<p>Hezbollah said it had bombarded the northern Israeli town of "Kiryat Shmona with a volley of Falaq rockets" early Sunday "in response to the enemy attacks... and particularly the attack" that killed the emergency workers in the Lebanese village of Froun.</p>

<p>On Saturday, Lebanon's health ministry said three emergency responders were killed and two others wounded, one of them critically, in an Israeli strike on Froun.</p>

<p>The ministry said the attack had targeted "a Lebanese civil defence team that was putting out fires sparked by the recent Israeli strikes", while the Israeli military said it had "eliminated terrorists" from the Hezbollah-allied Amal movement in Froun.</p>

<p>Lebanon's civil defence agency said three of its employees were killed in "an Israeli strike that targeted a firefighting vehicle after they had finished a firefighting mission".</p>

<p>Prime Minister Najib Mikati condemned the attack, saying in a statement that "this new aggression against Lebanon is a blatant violation of international laws... and human values".</p>

<p>Separately on Sunday, Hezbollah said that its fighters had also fired rockets at the Israeli community of Shamir, near Kiryat Shmona.</p>

<p>Hezbollah usually says it targets military positions in northern Israel, while Israel has said it targets Hezbollah infrastructure and fighters in south and east Lebanon.</p>

<p>The Israeli military on Sunday morning announced it had carried out a series of air strikes on "Hezbollah military structures" and intercepted projectiles launched from Lebanon during the night.</p>

<p>In Froun on Saturday, a military statement said Israeli forces "struck and eliminated" Amal members who "operated within a Hezbollah military structure".</p>

<p>Hezbollah ally the Amal movement said two of its members were among the dead in Saturday's strike. It said they were killed "while carrying out their humanitarian and national duty defending Lebanon and the south".</p>

<p>The Lebanese health ministry statement condemned the "blatant Israeli attack that targeted a team from an official body of the Lebanese state".</p>

<p>It added that the attack was "the second of its kind against an emergency team in less than 12 hours".</p>

<p>Earlier Saturday, the ministry said two emergency personnel from the Hezbollah-affiliated Islamic Health Committee were wounded when "the Israeli enemy deliberately targeted" near a fire they were heading to extinguish in south Lebanon's Qabrikha, causing their vehicle to swerve.</p>

<p>Several militant groups operate health centres and emergency response operations in south Lebanon.</p>

<p>Hezbollah had announced a string of attacks on Israeli troops and positions near the border on Saturday, including with Katyusha rockets and "explosives-laden drones", some in a stated response to "Israeli enemy attacks" on south Lebanon.</p>

<p>The cross-border violence has killed some 614 people in Lebanon, mostly fighters but also including 138 civilians, according to an AFP tally.</p>

<p>On the Israeli side, including in the annexed Golan Heights, authorities have announced the deaths of at least 24 soldiers and 26 civilians.</p>

<p>A statement from Lebanese Health Minister Firass Abiad said that "due to the (Israeli) aggression", 27 emergency personnel and health workers have been killed and 94 others wounded since October.</p>

<p>Two hospitals and 21 health centres have been "targeted", while 32 fire or ambulance vehicles have been "put out of service or partially damaged", the statement said, urging an end to the "repeated and deliberate targeting of health workers and civilians".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Prince Harry was recently spotted attending the funeral of Lord Robert Fellowes, the husband of Lady Jane Fellowes, and is believed to have "secretly" stayed with his uncle Charles Spencer at Althorp House, the childhood home of Princess Diana.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prince Harry, who has been estranged from several members of the British royal family, including his brother Prince William and father King Charles, is reportedly still in close contact with his mother's relatives.</p>

<p>According to former BBC Royal correspondent Jennie Bond, the Duke of Sussex has maintained a strong connection with his aunts and uncle, Lady Sarah McCorquodale, Lady Jane Fellowes, and Charles Spencer, 9th Earl Spencer, who are the siblings of his late mother, Princess Diana.</p>

<p>"Quietly, behind the scenes, it is obvious that the Spencer family have kept the communication channels open with Harry and that their affection for him is reciprocated," Ms Bond told <a href="https://www.ok.co.uk/royal/prince-harry-communication-family-expert-33611483 ">OK!</a>&nbsp;“I'm sure Harry feels it's important that he still has some kind of anchor here in the UK and, for now at least, it seems that it is with his aunts and uncle. And that has to be a positive thing.”</p>

<p>Prince Harry was recently spotted attending the funeral of Lord Robert Fellowes, the husband of Lady Jane Fellowes, and is believed to have "secretly" stayed with his uncle Charles Spencer at Althorp House, the childhood home of Princess Diana.</p>

<p>The Spencer family has been a constant source of support for Harry, who has faced scrutiny and criticism since stepping back from royal duties. His late mother, Princess Diana, was laid to rest on the grounds of Althorp House, which holds sentimental value for Harry.</p>

<p>The news comes as Prince Harry's relationship with his brother, Prince William, and father, King Charles, remains tense.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"It's much better that Harry has some links with his UK family, even if reconciliation with the Windsor side may be a long way off, if indeed it is possible,” said the royal expert.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Duke of Sussex has also reportedly remained on good terms with his paternal cousin, Princess Beatrice, who may hold the key to "initiating peace" in the ongoing feud between Harry and William, according to a former palace staffer.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Congress leader Rahul Gandhi began his three-day visit to the US, arriving in Dallas, Texas, on Sunday, where he was warmly welcomed by members of the Indian diaspora and the Indian Overseas Congress (IOC).]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Congress leader Rahul Gandhi began his three-day visit to the US, arriving in Dallas, Texas, on Sunday, where he was warmly welcomed by members of the Indian diaspora and the Indian Overseas Congress (IOC).</p>

<p>Taking to his social media, the Congress leader shared the pictures of his welcome and wrote, "I am truly delighted by the warm welcome I've received in Dallas, Texas, USA, from the Indian Diaspora and members of the Indian Overseas Congress."</p>

<p>"I eagerly look forward to engaging in meaningful discussions and insightful conversations that will further strengthen the bond between our two nations during this visit," he added.</p>

<p>This is Rahul Gandhi's first trip to America since the 2024 Lok Sabha elections.</p>

<p>The Congress leader will be in Dallas, Texas, on September 8 and in Washington, DC, on September 9-10.</p>

<p>Earlier, announcing Rahul Gandhi's visit, IOC chief Sam Pitroda said that the Indian diaspora, including NRI residents, technocrats, business leaders, students, media fraternity and even political leaders, are eager to welcome the Congress MP and are looking forward to having an interaction with him.</p>

<p>"There are lots of events planned with a variety of people because they also have interest in the states where Congress party runs governments, particularly the tech cities like Bangalore, Hyderabad, Mumbai and Pune. We see great interest in conversation with business and technological community," he further informed.</p>

<p>"We look forward to a very successful visit and look forward to welcoming Rahul Gandhi to the US," Pitroda said on a concluding note.</p>

<p>He also said that he was 'bombarded' with questions about Rahul Gandhi's US visit from various quarters, and this video message was apparently to inform them about the Congress leader's short but highly anticipated trip to the US.</p>

<p>Notably, Rahul Gandhi, after the 2024 Lok Sabha results, has been creating good momentum and garnering people's support with his views on many issues of public interest. Political watchers anticipate his US visit to be more newsworthy and stir larger controversy back home this time.</p>

<p>Rahul won elections from two Lok Sabha constituencies – Rae Bareli and Wayanad, however, he chose to retain the former and leave the latter for his sister, Priyanka Gandhi.</p>

<p>In June this year, he was appointed the Leader of the Opposition (LoP) in the Lok Sabha after getting a nod from the Congress Working Committee (CWC).</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Venezuela's former presidential opposition candidate Edmundo Gonzalez has left for Spain in the wake of the South American country's contested election, Venezuelan and Spanish officials said on Saturday.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Venezuela's former presidential opposition candidate Edmundo Gonzalez has left for Spain in the wake of the South American country's contested election, Venezuelan and Spanish officials said on Saturday night after a day of rising diplomatic tensions.</p>

<p>Gonzalez, 75, who ran against President Nicolas Maduro in July, left after "voluntarily seeking refuge in the Spanish embassy in Caracas several days ago," Venezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodriguez posted on Instagram.</p>

<p>"Edmundo Gonzalez has taken off from Caracas heading to Spain on a Spanish Air Force plane," Spain's Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Albares posted on X, saying Madrid was responding to a request from Gonzalez.</p>

<p>Gonzalez's exit from Venezuela is the latest political development since the country's election on July 28. Democracies around the world have criticized the Venezuelan government's handling of the vote, which election officials and its top court say was won by Maduro.</p>

<p>Venezuela's opposition say the election resulted in a resounding victory for Gonzalez, and published vote tallies online that they say show he won.</p>

<p>This week prosecutors issued an arrest warrant for Gonzalez in connection to the online publication of the tallies, accusing him of usurping functions, falsifying public documents and conspiracy, among other charges.</p>

<p>Earlier on Saturday, Venezuela's government revoked Brazil's authorization to represent Argentine interests in the country, including administering the embassy where six opposition figures are sheltering.</p>

<p>Venezuela broke relations with Argentina after the presidential election. Brazil, like Colombia and Mexico, has asked the Venezuelan government to publish the full results of the vote.</p>

<p>The government has not done so and the country's electoral authority said Maduro won re-election for a third term.</p>

<p>In a statement, Venezuela said the decision, effective immediately, was due to proof that the embassy was being used to plan assassination attempts against Maduro and Rodriguez.</p>

<p>Brazil said it had received the communication that its authorization had been revoked "with surprise." Argentina said it rejected the "unilateral" decision. Both countries urged Maduro to respect the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations.</p>

<p>"Any attempt to invade or kidnap asylum seekers who remain in our official residence will be harshly condemned by the international community," Argentina said in a statement. "Actions like these reinforce the conviction that in Maduro's Venezuela, fundamental human rights are not respected."</p>

<p>A Brazilian diplomatic source said on Saturday afternoon that Venezuela had assured Brazil it would not invade the embassy.</p>

<p>In its statement, Brazil insisted it would remain in custody and defense of Argentine interests until Argentina indicated another state acceptable to Venezuela to do so.</p>

<p>"The Brazilian government highlights in this context, under the terms of the Vienna Conventions, the inviolability of the facilities of the Argentine diplomatic mission," it said, adding that it housed six Venezuelan asylum seekers, assets and archives.</p>

<p>The escalation in the spat between the South American countries was first reported by Reuters.</p>

<p>In March, six people sought asylum in the Argentine embassy in Caracas after a prosecutor ordered their arrest on charges including conspiracy. Opposition leader Maria Corina Machado has denied the allegations against her collaborators.</p>

<p>On Friday night, some opposition members in the Argentine residence reported on their X accounts that the building was under surveillance and had no electricity. They posted videos showing men dressed in black and patrols from the government intelligence agency, SEBIN.</p>

<p>Argentina's Foreign Ministry asked the International Criminal Court on Friday to issue an arrest warrant against Maduro and other senior government officials for events that occurred after the elections.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Amina Sohail veers through heavy traffic to pick up her next passenger -- the sight of a woman riding a motorcycle drawing stares in Pakistan's megacity of Karachi. The 28-year-old is the first woman in her family to enter the workforce, a pattern emerging in urban households coming under increasing financial pressure in Pakistan.</p>

<p>"I don't focus on people, I don't speak to anyone or respond to the hooting, I do my work," said Sohail, who joined a local ride-hailing service at the start of the year, transporting women through the dusty back streets of the city.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Before, we would be hungry, now we get to eat at least two to three meals a day," she added.</p>

<p>The South Asian nation is locked in a cycle of political and economic crises, dependent on IMF bailouts and loans from friendly countries to service its debt.</p>

<p>Prolonged inflation has forced up the price of basic groceries such as tomatoes by 100 per cent. Electricity and gas bills have risen by 300 per cent compared to July last year, according to official data.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sohail used to help her mother with cooking, cleaning and looking after her younger siblings, until her father, the family's sole earner, fell sick.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The atmosphere in the house was stressful," she said, with the family dependent on other relatives for money. "That's when I thought I must work." &nbsp;</p>

<p>"My vision has changed. I will work openly like any man, no matter what anyone thinks."</p>

<h3><strong>'Get her married'</strong></h3>

<p>Pakistan was the first Muslim nation to be led by a woman prime minister in the 1980s, women CEOs grace power lists in Forbes magazine, and they now make up the ranks of the police and military.</p>

<p>However, much of Pakistani society operates under a traditional code that requires women to have permission from their family to work outside of the home.</p>

<p>According to the United Nations, just 21 percent of women participate in Pakistan's work force, most of them in the informal sector and almost half in rural areas working in the fields.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I am the first girl in the family to work, from both my paternal and maternal side," said Hina Saleem, a 24-year-old telephone operator at a leather factory in Korangi, Karachi's largest industrial area.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The move, supported by her mother after her father died, was met with resistance from her extended family.</p>

<p>Her younger brother was warned that working could lead to socially unacceptable behaviour, such as finding a husband of her choice.</p>

<p>"My uncles said 'get her married'," she told AFP. "There was lots of pressure on my mother."</p>

<p>At the changeover of shifts outside the leather factory, workers arrive in painted buses decorated with chinking bells, with a handful of women stepping out amid the crowd of men.</p>

<p>Nineteen-year-old Anum Shahzadi, who works in the same factory inputting data, was encouraged by her parents to enter the workforce after completing high school, unlike generations before her.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"What is the point of education if a girl can't be independent," said Shahzadi, who now contributes to the household alongside her brother.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bushra Khaliq, executive director for Women In Struggle for Empowerment (WISE) which advocates for political and economic rights for women, said that Pakistan was "witnessing a shift" among urban middle class women.</p>

<p>"Up until this point, they had been told by society that taking care of their homes and marriage were the ultimate objective," she told AFP.</p>

<p>"But an economic crunch and any social and economic crises bring with them a lot of opportunities."&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>'We are companions'</strong></h3>

<p>Farzana Augustine, from Pakistan's minority Christian community, earned her first salary last year at the age of 43 after her husband lost his job during the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>"My wife had to take over," Augustine Saddique explained to AFP.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"But it is nothing to be sad about, we are companions and are running our house together."&nbsp;</p>

<p>The sprawling port metropolis of Karachi, officially home to 20 million people but likely many millions more, is the business centre of Pakistan.</p>

<p>It pulls in migrants and entrepreneurs from across the country with the promise of employment and often acts as a bellwether for social change.</p>

<p>Nineteen-year-old Zahra Afzal moved to Karachi to live with her uncle four years ago, after the death of her parents, leaving her small village in central-eastern Pakistan to work as a childminder.</p>

<p>"If Zahra was taken by other relatives, she would have been married off by now," her uncle Kamran Aziz told AFP, from their typical one room home where bedding is folded away in the morning and cooking is done on the balcony.</p>

<p>"My wife and I decided we would go against the grain and raise our girls to survive in the world before settling them down."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Afzal beams that she is now an example for her sister and cousin: "My mind has become fresh."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden has spent a significant amount of time on vacation during his term in office, revealed a recent analysis by the Republican National Committee. According to the data, the 81-year-old has taken 532 vacation days in less than four years, which accounts for approximately 40 per cent of his time in office.</p>

<p><meta charset="utf-8" /></p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Biden spent today — his 16th straight day on vacation — lounging on the beach.<br />
<br />
He has spent a total of 532 days (40.3% of his presidency) on vacation.<br />
<br />
Who's running the country? <a href="https://t.co/YIStPQR3Vl">pic.twitter.com/YIStPQR3Vl</a></p>
— RNC Research (@RNCResearch) <a href="https://twitter.com/RNCResearch/status/1830025501190373610?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 31, 2024</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>This means that President Biden has accumulated more vacation days in a shorter period than the average American worker would in nearly five decades. The average American receives 11 days of vacation per year, making President Biden's vacation time equivalent to about 48 years' worth of vacation days for the average citizen.</p>

<p>Critics argue that the President's extensive vacation time is inappropriate, especially during a time of global uncertainty and domestic challenges. Mark Paoletta, former general counsel of the White House budget office under President Donald Trump, stated, “The image of Biden fast asleep and lying flat on his back in his chair at the beach while America and the world is on fire will define the Biden presidency,” as per the <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/09/07/us-news/biden-took-48-years-worth-of-vacation-while-president/ ">NY Post</a>.</p>

<p>Critics have also pointed to issues such as inflation, border security and international conflicts, suggesting that the President should be more focused on addressing these concerns.</p>

<p>However, presidential aides maintain that President Biden, like his predecessors, works remotely and remains on call even when on vacation. Despite this, some have questioned the frequency and duration of his breaks, with Rep. Nicole Malliotakis (R-Staten Island/Brooklyn) jokingly suggesting that he should take more time off.</p>

<p>A comparison of President Biden's vacation time to that of previous presidents reveals that he has taken more time off than his predecessors. While former US President Donald Trump spent 26 per cent of his presidency on personal trips, President Biden's 40 per cent out-of-office ratio surpasses that. In contrast, Ronald Reagan and Barack Obama vacationed for just 11 per cent of their two-term presidencies, and Jimmy Carter took only 79 days' worth of breaks during his single term.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Aysenur Ezgi Eygi, 26, was shot and killed by Israeli troops when she was taking part in a protest against settlement expansion in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli troops shot and killed a Turkish-American woman who had been taking part in a protest against settlement expansion in the Israeli-occupied West Bank on Friday, Palestinian and Turkish officials said.</p>

<p>The White House said it was deeply disturbed by the death of Aysenur Ezgi Eygi and called on Israel to investigate. Turkey's foreign ministry said she was shot in the head, and blamed Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government for her death.</p>

<p>Palestinian officials described her as a 26-year-old activist from Seattle who held US and Turkish citizenship.</p>

<p>Eygi had recently graduated from the University of Washington in Seattle, the school's president, Ana Mari Cauce, said in a statement describing the news of her death as "awful" and saying Eygi had a "positive influence" on other students.</p>

<p>She studied psychology and Middle Eastern languages and cultures at the university, her family said in a statement late on Friday that was shared by the pro-Palestinian organization Institute of Middle East Understanding.</p>

<p>Israel's military said its troops had fired toward a male "main instigator" who posed a threat by hurling rocks at soldiers.</p>

<p>The military was looking into reports that a female foreign national "was killed as a result of shots fired in the area. The details of the incident and the circumstances in which she was hit are under review."</p>

<p>There was no immediate comment on the incident from Netanyahu's office.</p>

<p>Fouad Nafaa, head of Rafidia Hospital in Nablus, told Reuters that Eygi had arrived there in critical condition with a serious head injury.</p>

<p>"We tried to perform a resuscitation operation on her, but unfortunately she died," he said.</p>

<p>The Palestinian Authority's official news agency, WAFA, said the incident occurred during a regular protest march by activists in Beita, a village near Nablus that has seen repeated attacks on Palestinians by Jewish settlers.</p>

<p>Eygi's family described her as a "fiercely passionate human rights activist" who had recently participated in college campus protests against U.S. support for Israel's war in Gaza. The statement called on President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris to pursue an independent U.S. probe into her killing.</p>

<p>"I begged her not to go (to the West Bank), but she had this deep conviction that she wanted to participate in the tradition of bearing witness to the oppression of people and their dignified resilience," Aria Fani, an assistant professor of Middle Eastern languages and cultures at the University of Washington, told the Guardian.</p>

<p>The university president said, "Aysenur was a peer mentor in psychology who helped welcome new students to the department and provided a positive influence in their lives."</p>

<h3><strong>'DEEPLY DISTURBED'</strong></h3>

<p>White House's National Security Council spokesperson Sean Savett said Washington was "deeply disturbed by the tragic death of an American citizen" in the West Bank on Friday.</p>

<p>"We have reached out to the Government of Israel to ask for more information and request an investigation into the incident," Savett said in a statement.</p>

<p>U.S. Senator Chris Van Hollen said Eygi was the third American killed in the West Bank since October 7, when Hamas attack on Israel sparked the war in Gaza and a resurgence of West Bank violence.</p>

<p>The "Biden Administration has not been doing enough to pursue justice and accountability on their behalf", said Van Hollen, a Democrat like Biden and Harris, who sits on the Senate's Foreign Relations Committee. "If the Netanyahu Government will not pursue justice for Americans, the U.S. Department of Justice must."</p>

<p>Turkey's President Tayyip Erdogan condemned Eygi's death, saying in a post on social media that Turkey "will continue to work in every platform to halt Israel's policy of occupation and genocide". Israel denies its actions in occupied Palestinian territories amount to genocide.</p>

<p>In a separate incident on Friday near Beita, in the village of Qaryut, a 13-year-old girl was killed by Israeli gunfire, Palestinian health officials said, after settlers attacked the village.</p>

<p>WAFA quoted the girl's father as saying she was in their home when it was hit by gunfire. The Israeli military said it was investigating after its troops had fired in the air to disperse what it described as violent confrontations between dozens of settlers and Palestinians in the area.</p>

<p>A rise in violent attacks by Israeli settlers on Palestinians in the West Bank has stirred anger among Western allies of Israel, including the United States, which has imposed sanctions on some Israelis involved in the settler movement.</p>

<p>Several weeks ago around 100 settlers attacked the village of Jit in the northern West Bank, drawing worldwide condemnation and an Israeli government promise of swift action against anyone found guilty of violence.</p>

<p>Since the 1967 Middle East war, Israel has occupied the West Bank of the Jordan River, which Palestinians want as the core of an independent state. Israel has built settlements there that most countries deem illegal, which Israel disputes citing historical and biblical ties to the land.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A top Iranian military commander has said his country had, some time ago, hit 12 Israeli vessels north of the Indian Ocean and elsewhere in response to Israel's attacks on 14 Iranian ships, according to state media. Hossein Salami, chief commander of Iran's Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC), made the remarks on Saturday during a meeting in the capital Tehran between Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian and commanders of the Khatam al-Anbiya Construction Headquarters, an Iranian firm controlled by the IRGC.</p>

<p>He was detailing a maritime battle between Iran and Israel that occurred sometime after the reimposition of US sanctions on Tehran in 2018, though he did not specify the exact dates of the battle or related events, Xinhua news agency reported.</p>

<p>According to Salami, Israel hit 14 Iranian ships to disrupt Iran's oil exports.</p>

<p>"Initially, we did not realise who or which country was targeting the ships, but we eventually found out that it was Israel that had done it in a secretive and vague manner."</p>

<p>"North of the Indian Ocean and in different places, we hit 12 Israeli ships. After hitting the fifth vessel, they raised their hands in surrender and said they would cease the war between the ships," he said.</p>

<p>"When we struck (captured) the fifth Israeli ship, they raised their hands (in surrender) and agreed to cease the naval confrontation," Salami said during a visit to the Khatam al-Anbiya Construction Headquarters.</p>

<p>"They targeted 14 of our ships to prevent our oil from being exported. We didn't know who was behind it at first because it was done so covertly, but we eventually figured it out: the Zionist regime. We targeted 12 of their ships, and when we had the fifth, they raised their hands (in surrender) and declared the naval confrontation over."</p>

<p>He further said, "The British seized our ship in Gibraltar, and we seized the Stena Impero ship in exchange, prompting their surrender. They seized two of our ships in Greece, we took two of theirs, and they eventually surrendered."</p>

<p>General Salami reflected on the past six years, marked by sanctions, the Covid-19 pandemic, and political isolation attempts.</p>

<p>"Our enemy placed us at the crossroads of sanctions, the Covid-19 pandemic, (former US President Donald) Trump (who was no less harmful than Covid-19), the threat of military operations, and pressure for political isolation," Salami said, recounting challenges such as the assassination of Lietenant General Qassem Soleimani and the impact of economic sanctions.</p>

<p>"They tried to politically isolate us. We needed to create deterrence against these threats in multiple directions. First, we needed to secure the shipping lanes. When the Americans attempted to seize one of our ships, our forces prevented it, and the Americans were left humiliated. Following this, the enforcement of sanctions began to deteriorate," he added.</p>

<p>Additionally, he praised the IRGC's success in countering extremist threats abroad and safeguarding Iranian oil tankers, noting that American threats failed to materialise after the IRGC simulated an operation to capture a US tanker.</p>

<p>"We succeeded in closing off all the paths the enemy had opened against us, and today the safest shipping routes are those used by Iranian ships. The Americans threatened to seize two of our oil tankers as they headed to Venezuela. I went out with General Tangsiri and simulated an operation to capture an American tanker, which we announced over the radio. When the Americans saw this, our tankers arrived safely," he said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>National Security Advisor Ajit Doval will be travelling to Moscow this week to hold discussions aimed at resolving the Russia-Ukraine conflict, sources have said. This comes after Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited both Russia and Ukraine in the past two months and met its leaders Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelensky.</p>

<p>Shortly after his trip to Ukraine and his meeting with President Zelensky, the Prime Minister spoke to President Putin over the phone on August 27. A Russian Embassy statement said that during the phone call, Prime Minister Modi informed President Putin about his recent visit to Kiev and stressed India's commitment to bring about a settlement for Ukraine by political and diplomatic means.</p>

<p>According to sources, it was during this phone call that the leaders decided that NSA Doval would travel to Moscow for peace talks. No details regarding the schedule of this visit are currently available.</p>

<p>"Vladimir Putin shared his principled assessment of the destructive policies of the Kiev authorities and their Western patrons, and went on to highlight Russia's approaches to resolving this conflict," the Russian Embassy said about the phone call.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister's Office said the two leaders exchanged views on the Russia-Ukraine conflict. "The PM shared insights from his recent visit to Ukraine. He underlined the importance of dialogue and diplomacy as well as sincere and practical engagement between all stakeholders to achieve an abiding and peaceful resolution of the conflict," a PMO release said.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister reiterated India's firm commitment to support an "early, abiding and peaceful resolution of the conflict" on his official handle on X.</p>

<p>Last month, the Prime Minister was in Ukraine and met its President Volodymyr Zelensky. During the meeting, the two sides discussed the Russia-Ukraine conflict and Prime Minister Modi said, "India was never neutral, we have always been on the side of peace."</p>

<p>President Putin has named India among the three countries Russia is in touch with over the Ukraine conflict. "We respect our friends and partners, who, I believe, sincerely seek to resolve all issues surrounding this conflict, primarily China, Brazil and India. I constantly keep in touch with our colleagues on this issue," Putin said.</p>

<p>Other world leaders, too, are of the view that India can play a key role in finding a resolution to the Ukraine conflict. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni yesterday held talks with Ukraine President Zelensky. "China and India have a role to play in resolving the conflict. What must not happen is to think that the conflict can be resolved by abandoning Ukraine to its fate," she said, according to reports in Italian media.</p>

<p>The Russia-Ukraine conflict has sharply divided the world and most global powers have taken sides. New Delhi, however, has constantly called for peace, with Prime Minister Modi stressing that "this is not an era of war".</p>

<p>When Prime Minister Modi travelled to Russia in July and hugged President Putin, President Zelensky had referred to a Russian missile strike that killed 37 people, three of them children. He had said it is "a devastating blow to peace efforts to see the leader of the world's largest democracy hug the world's most bloody criminal in Moscow on such a day". On his recent visit to Ukraine, Prime Minister Modi embraced President Zelensky and the Ukraine leader said he and Prime Minister Modi had "honoured the memory of children whose lives were taken by Russian aggression". "Children of every country deserve to be safe. We must make it possible," he said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From Gerald Ford's catastrophic Soviet gaffe to Ronald Reagan's witty remark about his age and Joe Biden's infamous implosion, US presidential debates have featured jaw-dropping moments.</p>

<p>Here are some of the most memorable in modern US politics.</p>

<h3><strong>Kennedy-Nixon, September 26, 1960</strong></h3>

<p>It was the first televised debate of its kind, when broadcasts were in black-and-white, and it established the importance of a politician's public image. Republican Richard Nixon looked poised to win the election, having served two terms as vice president under Dwight Eisenhower.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-media-max-width="560">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">"I'm Bill Shadel ABC News...The 2 candidates will not be sharing same platform. In NY John F Kennedy. Separated by 3,000 miles in L.A. studio, Richard Nixon. Joined for discussion by network of electronic facilities which permits each candidate to see &amp; hear the other"<br />
10/13/1960 <a href="https://t.co/9GottJMbPP">pic.twitter.com/9GottJMbPP</a></p>
— Howard Mortman (@HowardMortman) <a href="https://twitter.com/HowardMortman/status/1314194594737926146?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 8, 2020</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>But the debate did not go well for him. Nixon refused to wear makeup and appeared pale and sweaty in front of more than 66 million viewers, while young Massachusetts senator John F Kennedy looked tanned and relaxed. While Nixon addressed the moderator, Kennedy looked at the camera, speaking directly to his voters.&nbsp;</p>

<p>How much the debate visuals pushed the needle is disputed, but Kennedy went on to defeat Nixon at the polls.</p>

<h3><strong>Ford-Carter, October 6, 1976</strong></h3>

<p>The first debate between Republican president Gerald Ford and Democratic challenger Jimmy Carter was marked by a 27-minute loss of audio. The second debate didn't go well for Ford either when he made a gaffe that arguably cost him the presidency.</p>

<p>At the height of the Cold War, Ford uttered that "there is no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe, and there never will be under a Ford administration," even though the Soviet Union had troops deployed across the Eastern bloc.</p>

<p>Six days passed before Ford explained himself, saying he spoke not of the literal military presence but meant that people's spirits there hadn't been crushed.</p>

<h3><strong>Reagan-Mondale, October 21, 1984</strong></h3>

<p>Republican president Ronald Reagan was 73 when he ran for a second term against 56-year-old Walter Mondale. But he turned his age into his strength with a witty answer that went down in history.</p>

<p>"I will not make age an issue of this campaign," Reagan said when asked whether he was fit for office. "I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent's youth and inexperience."</p>

<h3><strong>Bush-Clinton-Perot, October 15, 1992</strong></h3>

<p>The second presidential debate in the 1992 race pitted incumbent president George Bush against both his future successor Bill Clinton and Ross Perot, an independent candidate.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bush was caught on camera looking at his watch while Clinton talked to an audience member during a town hall debate, a move that cost Bush dearly.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Years later, Bush admitted he hated debates. "Maybe that's why I was looking at it -- 'Only 10 more minutes of this crap.'"</p>

<h2><strong>Obama-Romney, October 22, 2012</strong></h2>

<p>During a debate against president Barack Obama, Republican challenger Mitt Romney lamented that the US Navy had fewer ships presently than it did in 1916.</p>

<p>"Governor, we also have fewer horses and bayonets, because the nature of our military's changed," Obama retorted.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We have these things called aircraft carriers, where planes land on them. We have these ships that go under water, nuclear submarines."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Obama's comments went viral.</p>

<h3><strong>Trump-Clinton, October 9, 2016</strong></h3>

<p>The second debate of the 2016 US presidential election pitting Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump was particularly vicious.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Coming shortly after the release of a video in which Trump was heard boasting that his fame allowed him to grope women, the Republican billionaire went after his opponent's husband, former president Bill Clinton, accusing him of being "so abusive to women."</p>

<p>Trump also vowed to have Hillary Clinton investigated over her use of a private email account when she was secretary of state.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"It's just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country," Clinton said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Trump shot back: "Because you'd be in jail."</p>

<h3><strong>Trump-Biden, September 29, 2020</strong></h3>

<p>The first debate of the 2020 presidential election, featuring Trump and Democrat Joe Biden, devolved into shouting and insults.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With Trump constantly interrupting him, Biden snapped, saying, "Will you shut up, man?"&nbsp;</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="The then US President Donald Trump (L) and Democratic Presidential candidate Joe Biden exchange arguments during the first presidential debate at Case Western Reserve University and Cleveland Clinic in Cleveland, Ohio, on September 29, 2020" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-09/agq0qis_donald-trump-joe-biden_625x300_08_September_24.jpg?im=FaceCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=1200,height=738" title="The then US President Donald Trump (L) and Democratic Presidential candidate Joe Biden exchange arguments during the first presidential debate at Case Western Reserve University and Cleveland Clinic in Cleveland, Ohio, on September 29, 2020" /></div>

<p>The Democrat also called his opponent a "clown" and "Putin's puppy."</p>

<p>Trump for his part kept evading the question of whether he would recognize the results of the election.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Powerless to control the two candidates, the debate moderator, Fox News journalist Chris Wallace, later described feeling "desperation."</p>

<h3><strong>Trump-Biden, June 27, 2024</strong></h3>

<p>Organized an unprecedented four months ahead of this year's November vote, the June debate was supposed to give Biden, 81, a chance to shore up concerns about his age.</p>

<p>But it was a debacle for the Democrat, who repeatedly lost his train of thought, stared blankly and spoke at times incoherently and with a raspy voice.</p>

<p>The dismal performance set the stage for Biden to eventually drop out of the race -- passing the torch to Trump's new challenger, Vice President Kamala Harris.</p>

<p>Harris and Trump will now debate on Tuesday.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US Vice President Kamala Harris and former president Donald Trump will face off in a debate for the first time on Tuesday, each seeking an edge in what has become a neck-and-neck race for the White House. After weeks of back-and-forth on the where, when and how of the debate, US broadcaster ABC -- which is hosting the event -- announced the final rules of the contest, as agreed to by the two campaigns, this week.</p>

<p>Here are the major takeaways.</p>

<h3><strong>When and where to watch Trump vs Harris debate</strong></h3>

<p>The debate between <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-presidential-elections-2024-donald-trump-sounds-dark-tone-at-rally-kamala-harris-says-ready-for-debate-6514936" target="_blank">Donald Trump and Kamala Harris</a> will take place at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia at 9:00 pm local time Tuesday (0100 GMT Wednesday,) and will be aired live. There will be no audience present in the room.</p>

<p>The event will be moderated by ABC anchors David Muir and Linsey Davis, and will run for 90 minutes of debate time, with two commercial breaks.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Muted mics in Donald Trump vs Kamala Harris debate</strong><strong>?</strong></h3>

<p>The issue of whether <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/donald-trump-vs-kamala-harris-the-battle-over-hot-mics-heats-up-ahead-of-key-debate-6435273" target="_blank">microphones would be muted</a> -- as they were during a previous debate between US President Joe Biden and Trump -- was a contentious one, with each side accusing the other of cowardice over the question.</p>

<p>ABC has announced that each candidate's microphone will only be live for when it is their turn to speak, and muted when the time belongs to the other candidate.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Only moderators will be allowed to ask questions, and no topics or questions will be shared in advance with the candidates.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Who speaks when?</strong></h3>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/im-going-to-let-her-talk-donald-trump-on-debate-with-kamala-harris-6494910" target="_blank">Donald Trump</a> and <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/donald-trump-agrees-to-debate-with-kamala-harris-outlines-specific-rules-6432983" target="_blank">Kamala Harris</a> will not offer opening statements. They will be allotted two minutes to answer each question, with two minutes granted to their opponent for a rebuttal.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There will be an additional minute for "a follow-up, clarification, or response," according to the rules.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At the end of the debate, each candidate will offer a two-minute closing statement, with Trump to go last, as per the results of a virtual coin toss.</p>

<h3><strong>No props</strong></h3>

<p>Candidates will stand behind podiums through the entire length of the debate, with no props or pre-written notes allowed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Trump and Harris will each be given a pen, a pad of paper, and a bottle of water.</p>

<p>Campaign staff will not be allowed to speak or interact with the candidates during the commercial breaks.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is to deliver a landmark speech to the US Congress this week as he fights off intense pressure to cut a Gaza war ceasefire deal with Hamas.</p>

<p>Israel's longest-serving premier will on Wednesday become the first foreign leader to address a joint meeting of the two chambers four times -- pulling ahead of Britain's Winston Churchill on three.</p>

<p>But analysts say the Gaza war since the October 7 Hamas attacks has created worrying tensions between Israel and the United States, its main military and diplomatic backer. Netanyauhu's office announced that he will meet US President Joe Biden on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Washington fears a backlash from the mounting civilian toll in the Gaza Strip, while protests in Israel by families of hostages taken by Hamas are also causing headaches for Netanyahu.</p>

<p>Biden and some Israeli ministers say a deal negotiated through Qatar, Egyptian and US mediators is possible. A plan outlined in May proposed a six-week ceasefire when some Israeli hostages would be swapped for Palestinians held in Israeli prisons.&nbsp;</p>

<p>US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Friday that negotiators were "inside the 10 yard line and driving toward the goal line".</p>

<p>Hamas has accused Netanyahu of seeking to block a deal however and Blinken said he wants to "bring the agreement over the finish line" when Netanyahu is in Washington.</p>

<h2>Double pressure</h2>

<p>Israel has intensified its attacks on Gaza in recent weeks and Netanyahu has insisted that only piling on military pressure can free the hostages and beat Hamas.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"This double pressure is not delaying the deal -– it is advancing it," Netanyahu told troops in Gaza on Thursday.</p>

<p>The October 7 attack on Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,195 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures. Hamas militants also seized 251 hostages, 116 of whom are still in Gaza, including 42 the Israeli military says are dead.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory campaign has killed at least 38,919 people in Gaza, also mostly civilians, according to data from the health ministry in the Hamas-ruled territory.</p>

<p>Publicly, Biden has voiced strong support for Israel. But he expressed concern over an offensive on the southern city of Rafah in May and for a while suspended deliveries of heavy bombs to Israel. Supplies of 2,000-pound bombs remain embargoed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Never before has the atmosphere been so fraught," said Council on Foreign Relations Middle East specialist Steven Cook.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"There is clearly tension in the relationship, especially between the White House and the Israeli prime minister," Cook said in a commentary.</p>

<h2>'Political rhetoric'</h2>

<p>While US Republicans pressed to invite Netanyahu to address Congress, he has lost support among Democrats.</p>

<p>One Jewish senator, Democrat Brian Schatz of Hawaii, announced he would boycott Wednesday's speech, saying he would not listen to "political rhetoric that will do nothing to bring peace in the region".</p>

<p>Netanyahu said after being invited to Congress again that he would "present the truth about our just war against those who seek to destroy us".</p>

<p>Cook said that Netanyahu has two aims for his Washington trip.</p>

<p>First, to show that he has not "undermined" Israel's relations with the United States.</p>

<p>Netanyahu also "will endeavour to shift the conversation away from the conflict in Gaza toward the threat that Iran and its proxies pose" to Israel and the United States, Cook added.</p>

<p>Much attention will be focused on whether Netanyahu meets with Donald Trump or a figure close to the Republican presidential candidate.</p>

<p>Despite the tensions, the United States has defended Israeli interests while taking a key role in mediation efforts, and the military relationship remains strong, according to officials.</p>

<p>Washington's support could prove crucial as Israel faces increasing international criticism over the growing humanitarian toll from nearly 300 days of war.</p>

<p>The International Criminal Court's prosecutor in May asked judges to issue arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant. Warrants for three Hamas leaders have also been requested.</p>

<p>The Republican majority in the House of Representatives has called for sanctions against the ICC.</p>

<p>The International Court of Justice found Israel's occupation of Palestinian territories illegal on Friday, and in February called for the country to prevent any acts of genocide in its Gaza offensive.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iraq said Sunday a new power line will bring electricity from Turkey to its northern provinces as authorities aim to diversify the country's energy sources to ease chronic power outages.</p>

<p>The 115-kilometre line connects to Kisik power plant west of Mosul and will provide 300 megawatts from Turkey to Iraq's northern provinces of Nineveh, Salah al-Din and Kirkuk, according to a statement by the prime minister's office.</p>

<p>PM Mohamed Shia al-Sudani said the new line is a "strategic" step to link Iraq with neighbouring countries.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The line started operating today," Ahmed Moussa, spokesperson for the electricity ministry, told AFP.</p>

<p>Decades of war have left Iraq's infrastructure in a pitiful state, with power cuts worsening the blistering summer when temperatures often reach 50 Celsius (122 Fahrenheit).</p>

<p>Many households have just a few hours of mains electricity per day, and those who can afford it use private generators to keep fridges and air conditioners running.</p>

<p>Despite its vast oil reserves, Iraq remains dependent on imports to meet its energy needs, especially from neighbouring Iran, which regularly cuts supplies.</p>

<p>Sudani has repeatedly stressed the need for Iraq to diversify energy sources to ease the chronic outages.</p>

<p>To reduce its dependence on Iranian gas, Baghdad has been exploring several possibilities including imports from Gulf countries.</p>

<p>In March, a 340-kilometre (210-mile) power line started operating to bring electricity from Jordan to Al-Rutbah in Iraq's southwest.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russia said Sunday that it scrambled fighter jets to prevent two US strategic bomber planes from crossing its border over the Barents Sea in the Arctic.</p>

<p>The US military routinely carries out flights over international waters, operations that it says are conducted in neutral airspace and in accordance with international law.</p>

<p>But Moscow has responded more aggressively to the exercises in recent months, warning in June that US drone flights over the Black Sea risked leading to a "direct" military clash.</p>

<p>The Russian defence ministry said it had scrambled fighter jets to intercept an "air target approaching the state border of the Russian Federation".</p>

<p>"The crews of the Russian fighters identified the aerial target as a pair of US Air Force B-52H strategic bombers," it said.</p>

<p>"As the Russian fighters approached, the American strategic bombers corrected their flight course, moving away and then turning away from Russia's state border," it said.</p>

<p>In June, Moscow accused the United States of using its reconnaissance drone flights over neutral waters in the Black Sea to help Ukraine strike the Russian-annexed Crimean peninsula.</p>

<p>It said that the flights increased the risk of a "direct confrontation" between NATO and Russia, and that its army had been instructed to prepare an "operational response".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A pram carrying twin two-year-old girls rolled into the path of an oncoming train in Sydney on Sunday, police said, in an accident that killed one of the children and the "heroic" father who dashed to their rescue.</p>

<p>One of the little girls survived only "through good luck" after she landed between the rails when the pram fell off a platform at southern Sydney's Carlton railway station, police said.</p>

<p>She was "largely untouched" by the train that apparently passed above her on its way to central Sydney in the early afternoon, police said.</p>

<p>The parents had taken a lift down to the station platform and as they exited, they took "their hands off the pram for a very, very short period of time", New South Wales police superintendent Paul Dunstan said.</p>

<p>"Whether it's a gust of wind or -- we're not quite sure -- but it appears that the pram has instantly started to roll in the direction of the train lines," he told a news conference.</p>

<p>Police and emergency services arrived within a few minutes of being alerted and were able to see the pram under the train, which had slowed on approach but was not scheduled to stop at the station.</p>

<p>"You could hear crying coming from underneath the train," the police superintendent said.</p>

<p>Though one of the children was unharmed, the other girl and her 40-year-old father had been killed.</p>

<p>The father had "just gone into parent mode" and tried to save his daughters, Dunstan said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"In doing so it's cost him his life, but it's an incredibly brave and heroic act by the dad."</p>

<p>The mother and her surviving daughter were taken to the local St. George Hospital, and were said to be in a stable condition.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The 39-year-old mother was "in a state of shock and struggling with what's happened" while being supported by family and friends in their local Indian community, Dunstan said.</p>

<p>New South Wales Premier Chris Minns said the local community would be pained by the accident.</p>

<p>"I hope over time they can gain some small solace knowing that the father died from an extraordinary, instinctive act of bravery," Minns said.</p>

<p>"In the face of a terrible, terrible accident, he gave his own life to try and save his children."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Bangladesh Supreme Court today asked protesting students to "return to class" after issuing its verdict on contentious civil service hiring rules that led to deadly unrest.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bangladesh's top court on Sunday pared back, but fell short of public demands to abolish, contentious civil service hiring rules that sparked nationwide clashes between police and university students that have killed 151 people.</p>

<p>What began as a protest against politicised admission quotas for sought-after government jobs snowballed this week into some of the worst unrest of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's tenure.</p>

<p>Soldiers are patrolling cities across Bangladesh after riot police failed to restore order, while a nationwide internet blackout since Thursday has drastically restricted the flow of information to the outside world.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court was due to decide next month on the legality of the recently reintroduced scheme that reserves more than half of government jobs for select applicants, but brought forward its verdict as the civil strife intensified.</p>

<p>It decided that a lower bench's order last month to reintroduce the scheme was "illegal", Bangladeshi Attorney General A.M. Amin Uddin told AFP.</p>

<p>Shah Monjurul Hoque, a lawyer involved in the case, told AFP that the court had also asked protesting students "to return to class" after issuing its verdict.</p>

<p>The ruling curtailed the number of reserved jobs, from 56 percent of all positions to seven percent, but fell short of meeting protester demands.</p>

<p>It reserved five percent of all government jobs for the children of "freedom fighters" from Bangladesh's 1971 liberation war against Pakistan, down from 30 percent.</p>

<p>One percent were reserved for tribal communities, and another one percent for people with disabilities or identifying as third gender under Bangladeshi law.</p>

<p>The remaining 93 percent of positions would be decided on merit, the court ruled.</p>

<p>The "freedom fighter" category in particular is a point of resentment for young graduates, with critics saying it is used to stack public jobs with loyalists to Hasina's ruling Awami League.</p>

<p>Students had called for the complete abolition of that category, along with other quotas for women and specific districts of the country.</p>

<p><strong>'Our demand is one point'</strong></p>

<p>Opponents accuse Hasina's government of bending the judiciary to its will, and the premier had already hinted to the public this week that the court would issue a ruling favourable to student demands.</p>

<p>Hasina, 76, has ruled the country since 2009 and won her fourth consecutive election in January after a vote without genuine opposition.</p>

<p>Her government is accused by rights groups of misusing state institutions to entrench its hold on power and stamp out dissent, including by the extrajudicial killing of opposition activists.</p>

<p>But after the mounting crackdown and a rising death toll, it remains to be seen whether the court's verdict would mollify white-hot public anger.</p>

<p>"It's not about the rights of the students anymore," business owner Hasibul Sheikh, 24, told AFP at the scene of a Saturday street protest, held in the capital Dhaka in defiance of a nationwide curfew.</p>

<p>"Our demand is one point now, and that's the resignation of the government.</p>

<p><strong>'Made the situation worse</strong></p>

<p>With some 18 million young people in Bangladesh out of work, according to government figures, the quota scheme's reintroduction deeply upset graduates facing an acute jobs crisis.</p>

<p>Hasina inflamed tensions this month by likening protesters to the Bangladeshis who had collaborated with Pakistan during the country's independence war.</p>

<p>"Rather than try to address the protesters' grievances, the government's actions have made the situation worse," Crisis Group's Asia director Pierre Prakash told AFP.</p>

<p>Since Tuesday, at least 151 people, including several police officers, have been killed in clashes around the country, according to an AFP count of victims reported by police and hospitals.</p>

<p><strong>Curfew extended</strong></p>

<p>Police have arrested several members of the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and Students Against Discrimination, the main protest organising group.</p>

<p>Bangladesh home minister Asaduzzaman Khan told AFP that the curfew imposed on Saturday would continue "until the situation improves".</p>

<p>He said that in addition to the torching of government buildings and police posts by protesters, arson attacks had left Dhaka's metro rail network inoperable.</p>

<p>"They are carrying out destructive activities targeting the government," Khan said, blaming the BNP and the Islamist party Jamaat for stoking the violence.</p>

<p>The US State Department warned Americans on Saturday not to travel to Bangladesh and said it would begin removing some diplomats and their families from the country due to the civil unrest.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Malena Galletto, 17, has received acceptance letters from all eight Ivy League Schools. Not just that, the young sensation, from Washington Heights, has also received positive outcomes from the other 20 colleges and universities she applied to, reported the <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/07/20/us-news/bronx-science-hs-graduate-accepted-into-all-28-colleges-she-applies-to-including-the-eight-ivy-leagues/">NY Post.</a></p>

<p dir="ltr">“When I was about to open [an admissions] letter, I would prepare myself for it to be the first rejection letter. And then I would open them and it would always say, ‘Congratulations on being accepted!” Ms Galletto was quoted as saying.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">Ms Galletto, who got a 97% GPA, said that she got her first acceptance from the University of Albany.</p>

<p dir="ltr">She added, “For as long as I can remember, school has always been my number one priority. Even in elementary school, I remember always wanting to be at the top of my class,” she said, crediting her parents, both of whom teach tango and immigrated from their native Argentina to Washington Heights in 2000. They instilled in her that “education was the most important thing.”</p>

<p dir="ltr">Recalling the moment when she received the letter from Harvard University, Ms Galletto said, “The first one I opened was from Cornell [University], and when that was a ‘Yes,' it was life-changing…But when I opened Harvard [University], I was absolutely screaming. Deep down, it was always Harvard for me.”</p>

<p dir="ltr">Ms Galletto's mother Karina Romero also expressed her excitement about her daughter's achievements. “I am so incredibly proud. She's always studying and doing her very best, and I'm so happy she got what she worked so hard to achieve,” she said.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Ms Galletto has also received a shout-out from City Department of Education spokeswoman Nicole Brownstein. As per Ms Brownstein, the result is a “testament to her [Malena Galletto] hard work and dedication.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One person has died after a plane, used for skydiving, crashed in Niagara County, New York on Saturday, reported CNN. Following the incident, New York officials launched an investigation on Saturday.</p>

<p>The single-engine Cessna 208B, a plane that was used for skydiving, crashed near Lake Road near Youngstown, New York, shortly before 1 pm, the Federal Aviation Administration said in a statement.</p>

<p>The aeroplane from the Skydive the Falls skydiving centre had released all divers and was heading back to land when it crashed, according to a news release from the Niagara County Sheriff's Office on Saturday, as reported by CNN.</p>

<p>A spokesperson for the FAA, Tammy L. Jones, said that the pilot, who was the only person on board, was conducting parachute operations prior to the crash.</p>

<p>However, it is still unclear how many divers were on board before the crash, Niagara County Sheriff Michael Filicetti said at a news conference on Saturday.</p>

<p>Later, a brush fire also reportedly began around the crash site, according to the release.</p>

<p>The initial responding crew had to put out "a significant fire at that point," Filicetti said.</p>

<p>The sheriff called the plane crash "an unfortunate incident" and added that local and federal law enforcement partners are working to determine what led to the crash.</p>

<p>"Well, I think this is like any other emergency-type incident...You get here, you want to try to preserve life. Unfortunately, in this case, we couldn't do that," Filicetti said.</p>

<p>A National Transportation Safety Board investigator is expected to be travelling to the crash site on Saturday, NTSB spokesperson Peter Knudson told CNN.</p>

<p>The investigator will further document the aeroplane wreckage, which will then be moved to a secure facility for further evaluation, Knudson mentioned.</p>

<p>The investigation will involve three primary areas, including, the pilot, the aircraft and the operating environment, CNN reported.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>North Korea on Sunday floated balloons carrying trash towards South Korea, South Korea's military said, declaring it would respond with "full-scale" loudspeaker broadcasts.</p>

<p>The South Korean military said the North's actions raising tensions near the heavily armed border could have fatal consequences, adding the North Korean regime would be solely responsible.</p>

<p>"As we warned several times, the military will carry out loudspeaker broadcasts in full scale and on all fronts starting 1 p.m. today," the South's Joint Chiefs of Staff said, calling the North's launch of balloons vulgar and shameful.</p>

<p>Activists and defectors in South Korea have for years sent their own balloons carrying propaganda leaflets and other items into North Korea, angering Pyongyang.</p>

<p>Earlier this week, South Korea's military decided to resume its round-the-clock loudspeaker broadcast campaign targeting North Korea in response to what it called the despicable launch of balloons by Pyongyang carrying trash across the border.</p>

<p>Since May, North Korea has been floating thousands of balloons with bags of trash attached to them, which have become a new source of tension between the two Koreas.</p>

<p>Blaring propaganda, world news and K-pop music, South Korea's broadcasts are considered by military officials and activists as an effective form of psychological warfare.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli warplanes today struck targets around the Houthi-held Red Sea port of Yemen's Hudaydah, retaliating for a drone attack on Tel Aviv by the Iran-backed rebels that killed a man and exposed a vulnerability in Israeli air defences. The rebels claimed that three people had been killed in the strikes, which triggered a raging fire and plumes of black smoke.</p>

<p>Called Operation 'Outstretched Arm', these strikes are the furthest from the Israel territory ever conducted by their Air Force, the country said. This is the first attack claimed by Israel in the Arabian peninsula's poorest country.</p>

<p>"This operation struck targets 1,800 kilometres from our borders," Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a video statement. "It clarifies to our enemies that there is no place where the long arm of the State of Israel won't reach."</p>

<p>Explaining the strikes, the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) in a statement said that it struck targets around the Yemen port as it serves as an "entryway of Iranian weapons for the Houthi terrorist regime and as a significant economic source for them."</p>

<p>"Over the past few months, the Houthis have been operating in order to destabilise the Middle East. The Houthi terror attacks are funded and directed by Iran, harming the maritime freedom in the area, regional ports, the Suez Canal and global trade as a whole," the IDF added.</p>

<p>The Israeli strikes killed three people and wounded 87, the rebel-run health ministry said in a statement carried by Huthi media. The ministry said earlier that most of the wounded had severe burns.</p>

<p>Footage aired by the rebels' Al-Masirah television showed casualties being treated in hospital, many of them bandaged and lying on stretchers in packed rooms. &nbsp;</p>

<p>A man interviewed by the broadcaster said many of the wounded were port employees. "The city is dark, people are on the streets, petrol stations are closed and seeing long queues," he said.</p>

<p>The Houthis started targeting Israel with drones and missiles shortly after the war between Israeli forces and Hamas in Gaza began in October. None of those attacks are believed to have caused significant damage in Israel until now, with most projectiles being intercepted or failing to reach the country.</p>

<p>Houthi rebels say they're acting in solidarity with Palestinians and will continue the attacks until there's a ceasefire in Gaza.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>South Korea's First Lady Kim Keon Hee has been questioned over allegations of stock manipulation and graft involving a $2,200 luxury handbag, the prosecution said on Sunday.</p>

<p>The questioning comes as the opposition calls for a special probe into the first lady, who has been under scrutiny for accepting a Dior bag in violation of government ethics rules, and for her alleged role in a stock manipulation scheme.</p>

<p>Prosecutors conducted "face-to-face questioning" of Kim on Saturday, the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office said in a statement.</p>

<p>Hidden camera footage released last year appeared to show Kim accepting a $2,200 luxury designer handbag, an act that was later dubbed the "Dior bag scandal" by local papers.</p>

<p>The scandal-hit President Yoon Suk Yeol's already-low approval ratings, contributed to a stinging defeat for his party in general elections in April as it failed to win back a parliamentary majority.</p>

<p>Such a gift would violate South Korean law, which bans public officials and their spouses from accepting anything worth more than $750.</p>

<p>Kim's aide told investigators earlier this month that the first lady told her to return the bag on the same day she had received it, but she had forgotten to, according to Yonhap news agency.</p>

<p>In his first remarks on the bag scandal in February, Yoon dismissed it as a "political scheme" and said his wife had accepted the bag only because it was difficult for her to refuse it.</p>

<p>But he later apologised in a rare press conference in May, describing his wife's acceptance of the bag as "unwise".</p>

<p>It is not the first time Kim has faced public scrutiny. During Yoon's presidential campaign, she was forced to apologise over falsified credentials.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[In the midst of a blazing summer, some social media influencers are offering potentially dangerous advice on sun protection, despite stepped-up warnings from health experts about over-exposure amid rising rates of skin cancer.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dismissively tossing a tube of sunscreen over his shoulder, a bare-chested TikTok influencer declares that the cream causes cancer. He instead promotes "regular sun exposure" to his 400,000 followers -- contradicting US dermatologists fighting a surge in such dubious misinformation.</p>

<p>In the midst of a blazing summer, some social media influencers are offering potentially dangerous advice on sun protection, despite stepped-up warnings from health experts about over-exposure amid rising rates of skin cancer.</p>

<p>Further undermining public health, videos -- some garnering millions of views -- share "homemade" recipes that use ingredients such as beef tallow, avocado butter and beeswax for what is claimed to provide effective skin protection.</p>

<p>In one viral TikTok video, "transformation coach" Jerome Tan discards a commercial cream and tells his followers that eating natural foods will allow the body to make its "own sunscreen."</p>

<p>He offers no scientific evidence for this.</p>

<p>Such online misinformation is increasingly causing real-world harm, experts say.</p>

<p>One in seven American adults under 35 think daily sunscreen use is more harmful than direct sun exposure, and nearly a quarter believe staying hydrated can prevent a sunburn, according to a survey this year by Ipsos for the Orlando Health Cancer Institute.</p>

<p>"People buy into a lot of really dangerous ideas that put them at added risk," warned Rajesh Nair, an oncology surgeon with the institute.</p>

<h3><strong>'No safe tan'</strong></h3>

<p>As influencers increasingly cast doubt on commercial sunscreen products, another US survey showed a dip in their use, with some 75 percent of Americans using sunscreen regularly, down from 79 percent in 2022.</p>

<p>The findings coincide with other trends showing rising public mistrust of established medical guidance -- including on Covid-19 and other vaccines -- and increasing reliance on influencers with little or no scientific knowledge.</p>

<p>Dermatologists are scrambling to disabuse people of the increasingly popular perception that higher levels of sun exposure are good for the skin.</p>

<p>"There is no safe tan," Daniel Bennett, a dermatologist and professor at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, told AFP.</p>

<p>"The evidence that ultraviolet light exposure is the primary preventable driver of skin cancer is overwhelming," he added.</p>

<p>Many of the misleading or false claims come from influencers seeking to monetize their content on social media platforms, an echo chamber where sensational and false claims often drive engagement, experts say.</p>

<p>Some content creators are leveraging "sunscreen skepticism" to "sell their own supplements or endorse alternative all-natural sunscreens," Eric Dahan, founder of the influencer marketing agency Mighty Joy, told AFP.</p>

<h3><strong>'Sun paranoia'</strong></h3>

<p>Dahan pointed out one Instagram post that advised against "wearing sunscreen constantly" while promoting a range of skincare products.</p>

<p>"Say goodbye to sun paranoia," the emoji-laden post said. "Catch some (guilt-free) rays this summer."</p>

<p>Clutching a surfboard on a beach, another bare-chested Instagram influencer says he rejects sunscreen.</p>

<p>"Do I worry about skin cancer? I do not," he posted, while promoting "animal-based sunscreen" made from beef tallow.</p>

<p>Tallow -- essentially rendered, purified beef fat -- alone has no ability to block ultraviolet radiation, said Megan Poynot Couvillion, a dermatologist practicing in Texas.</p>

<p>"I don't see a problem with using it on the skin as an emollient, but absolutely not as a sunscreen," she told AFP.</p>

<p>The US Food and Drug Administration has called for more research into the ingredients in commercial sunscreens, but it does recommend their use, noting that excessive sun exposure is a major contributor to skin cancer.</p>

<p>Homemade sunscreens "lack effective sun protection," leaving users vulnerable to sunburn, premature skin aging and skin cancer, the American Academy of Dermatology warns.</p>

<p>Some influencers' recipes include zinc oxide, a known sun protector. But concocting sunscreen at home that will effectively block UV radiation is unrealistic, said Adam Friedman, professor at the George Washington University School of Medicine and Health Sciences.</p>

<p>"There's no way you're making this in your basement," Friedman told AFP.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Violence in Bangladesh has left over 130 dead as students demand reforms to a quota system governing the allocation of government jobs in the country.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Violence in Bangladesh has left over 130 dead as students demand reforms to a quota system governing the allocation of government jobs in the country. The protests intensified following Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's controversial remarks, where she labelled the protestors as "Razakars". This term, historically loaded and carrying a negative connotation, harks back to the East Pakistani volunteer force that opposed the creation of Bangladesh as a sovereign nation during its 1971 War of Independence.</p>

<h3><strong>The Spark</strong></h3>

<p>The protests, which began late last month, reached a boiling point earlier this week when student activists at Dhaka University, the largest university in the country, engaged in violent clashes with police and counter-protesters aligned with the ruling Awami League.</p>

<p>The controversial quota system reserves up to 30 per cent of government jobs for family members of veterans who fought in Bangladesh's 1971 war of independence against Pakistan. Protesters argue that this system is discriminatory and disproportionately benefits supporters of Prime Minister Hasina's Awami League party. They advocate for a merit-based system to replace the existing quota. Prime Minister Hasina's fiery remarks at a public gathering ignited further protests.</p>

<p>"If not the grandchildren of the freedom fighters, then who will get quota benefits? The grandchildren of the 'Razakars'?" the Bangladeshi PM asked. "This is my question. I want to ask the people of the nation. If the protesters don't comply, I can do nothing. They can continue their protest. If protesters damage properties or attack cops, the law will take its course. We can't help."</p>

<p>PM Hasina's intent was to highlight the importance of preserving benefits for the descendants of those who fought for Bangladesh's independence. However, the term "Razakar" struck a raw nerve. It is a term that conjures up memories of widespread violence from the 1971 War of Independence, during which the "Razakars" collaborated with the Pakistani army against the Bengali nationalist movement.</p>

<h3><strong>Historical Context Of The Term "Razakar"</strong></h3>

<p>The "Razakars" were a paramilitary force recruited by the Pakistani army during the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War. Comprised primarily of pro-Pakistani Bengalis and Urdu-speaking Biharis, the "Razakars" were involved in numerous atrocities, including mass killings, rapes, and torture. The 1971 war saw immense suffering, with estimates of civilian deaths ranging from 300,000 to 3 million. The scars of these events are still evident in the national psyche.</p>

<p>In 2010, Prime Minister Hasina's government established the International Crimes Tribunal to prosecute those accused of war crimes during the 1971 conflict. This move was part of her strategy to address historical injustices and was widely seen as a fulfilment of her party's electoral promises. The tribunal has since convicted several individuals, predominantly from the now-banned Jamaat-e-Islami party.</p>

<p>In December 2019, the government published a list of 10,789 individuals identified as "Razakars", marking the first official recognition of these collaborators. This list included prominent figures and was intended to ensure that future generations understand the historical context of their actions.</p>

<h3><strong>The Contentious Quota System</strong></h3>

<p>The current protests are rooted in the quota system for government jobs, which allocates significant portions to descendants of freedom fighters. This system, established in 1972 and abolished briefly in 2018 before being reinstated, has been a source of contention. Critics argue that it disproportionately benefits Awami League supporters and limits opportunities for other qualified candidates.</p>

<p>"They are protesting against the repressive nature of the state," said Mubashar Hasan, a Bangladesh expert at the University of Oslo in Norway, as quoted by news agency AFP. "Protesters are questioning Hasina's leadership, accusing her of clinging onto power by force. The students are in fact calling her a dictator."</p>

<p>Student protests against the quota system have a history in Bangladesh. The latest wave began after the decision to reinstate the system, which was followed by the Supreme Court suspending the order pending a government appeal. This legal limbo has left many students frustrated, feeling that their demands for a merit-based system are being ignored.</p>

<p>The students' grievances extend beyond the quota system. High youth unemployment and a stagnant economy have all contributed to a sense of frustration and despair. Public sector jobs, with their regular wages and benefits, are highly coveted in a country where economic opportunities are limited.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[What began as a protest against politicised admission quotas for sought-after government jobs snowballed this week into some of the worst unrest of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's tenure.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bangladesh's top court was due to rule Sunday on the future of civil service hiring rules that sparked <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/bangladesh-cops-given-shoot-on-sight-orders-amid-curfew-to-quell-student-protests-6151870">nationwide clashes</a> between police and university students, killing 133 people.&nbsp;</p>

<p>What began as a protest against politicised admission quotas for sought-after government jobs snowballed this week into some of the worst unrest of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's tenure.</p>

<p>Soldiers are patrolling cities across Bangladesh after riot police failed to restore order, while a nationwide internet blackout since Thursday has drastically restricted the flow of information to the outside world.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court was meeting later Sunday to issue a verdict on whether to abolish the contentious job quotas.</p>

<p>Hasina, whose opponents accuse her government of bending the judiciary to her will, hinted to the public this week that the scheme would be scrapped.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But after the mounting crackdown and a rising death count, a favourable verdict is unlikely to mollify white-hot public anger.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"It's not about the rights of the students anymore," business owner Hasibul Sheikh, 24, told AFP at the scene of a Saturday street protest, held in the capital Dhaka in defiance of a nationwide curfew.</p>

<p>"Our demand is one point now, and that's the resignation of the government."</p>

<p>The catalyst for this month's unrest is a system that reserves more than half of civil service posts for specific groups, including children of veterans from the country's 1971 liberation war against Pakistan.</p>

<p>Critics say the scheme benefits families loyal to Hasina, 76, who has ruled the country since 2009 and won her fourth consecutive election in January after a vote without genuine opposition.</p>

<p>Hasina's government is accused by rights groups of misusing state institutions to entrench its hold on power and stamp out dissent, including by the extrajudicial killing of opposition activists.</p>

<h3><strong>'Made the situation worse'</strong></h3>

<p>With Bangladesh unable to provide adequate employment opportunities for its 170 million people, the quota scheme is a pronounced source of resentment among young graduates facing an acute jobs crisis.</p>

<p>Hasina inflamed tensions this month by likening protesters to the Bangladeshis who had collaborated with Pakistan during the country's independence war.</p>

<p>"Rather than try to address the protesters' grievances, the government's actions have made the situation worse," Crisis Group's Asia director Pierre Prakash told AFP.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hasina had been due to leave the country on Sunday for a diplomatic tour to Spain and Brazil but abandoned her plans after a week of escalating violence.</p>

<p>Since Tuesday at least 133 people, including several police officers, have been killed in clashes around the country, according to an AFP count of victims reported by police and hospitals.</p>

<p>The US State Department warned Americans on Saturday not to travel to Bangladesh and said it would begin removing some diplomats and their families from the country due to the civil unrest.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>"I have a simple message for Israel's enemies: Do not doubt Israel's determination to defend itself on every front. All those who seek to harm us will pay a very heavy price for their aggression," Netanyahu said in a televised address.</p>

<p>He also said the port that was targeted was not an "innocent port". &nbsp;</p>

<p>"It was used as their (Houthis) entry point for weapons that are supplied by Iran to its Houthi terrorist proxies. The Houthis have used those weapons to attack Israel, to attack Arab states in the region, to attack many others," Netanyahu said.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-media-max-width="560">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this evening:<br />
<br />
“From the beginning of the war, I made it clear that Israel will act against all those who attack us.<br />
<br />
This is why earlier today, I asked the Israeli cabinet to back my decision to strike against the Houthi targets in Yemen. <a href="https://t.co/xWE3KXQaeV">pic.twitter.com/xWE3KXQaeV</a></p>
— Prime Minister of Israel (@IsraeliPM) <a href="https://twitter.com/IsraeliPM/status/1814763306264957160?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 20, 2024</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>"This strike comes in direct response to the killer drone attack that killed one person and injured several others, a hundred yards from the US Consulate in Tel Aviv. But the aggression of the Houthis goes well beyond that single attack. For the past eight months, the Houthis have launched hundreds of ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, and drones against Israel," he said.</p>

<p>Netanyahu also said the "only reason those attacks have not caused a greater loss of life has been the defensive measures taken by Israel and its allies, which together have intercepted hundreds of projectiles".</p>

<p>"But the drone attack that struck Israel on Friday shows that more than defensive action is needed to curtail the Houthis. Offensive action is also needed. It's needed to ensure that Iran's terror proxies pay a price for their brazen aggression," he added</p>

<p>He thanked the United States, Britain, France, and other members of the international maritime coalition that was formed to repel Houthi attacks.</p>

<h3><strong>Israeli Jets Strike Yemen Rebels At Hodeida Port</strong></h3>

<p>The Israeli strikes killed three people and wounded 87 at <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/series-of-strikes-hit-fuel-depot-in-yemens-port-city-casualties-feared-6149828" target="_blank">Hodeida port</a>. The attack targeted "fuel storage facilities and a power plant" in Hodeida "to pressure Yemen to stop supporting" Palestinians in Gaza, top Houthi official Mohammed Abdulsalam said while referring to the Israel-Hamas war.</p>

<p>Hodeida port, which is a vital entry point for imports and international aid for rebel-held areas of Yemen, had remained largely untouched through the decade-long war between the Houthis and the internationally recognised government propped up by neighbouring Saudi Arabia.</p>

<p>The Houthis' Lebanese ally, Hezbollah, has now warned that the Israeli strikes on Hodeida marked a dangerous turn nine months into the war in Gaza.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Soldiers patrolled the streets of Bangladesh to quell growing civil unrest sparked by student demonstrations, with the police being granted "shoot-on-sight" orders for those defying curfew.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<ol>
	<li>This week's violence has killed at least 133 people so far, posing a monumental challenge to Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's autocratic government after 15 years in office. Ms Hasina had been due to leave the country on Sunday for a planned diplomatic tour but abandoned her plans amid protests.</li>
	<li>With the death count climbing and police unable to contain the violent protests, the Bangladesh government on Friday imposed a national curfew and deployed the military.</li>
	<li>The curfew was lifted briefly on Saturday afternoon to allow people to run essential errands, but otherwise people have been ordered to remain at home and all gatherings and demonstrations have been banned.</li>
	<li>Authorities also imposed a nationwide internet shutdown on Thursday that remains in effect, severely hampering communication in and out of Bangladesh. Government websites remain offline and major newspapers including the Dhaka Tribune and Daily Star have been unable to update their social media platforms.</li>
	<li>&nbsp;The Supreme Court is set to meet later today to issue a verdict on whether to abolish the contentious job quotas.</li>
	<li>Nearly 1,000 Indian students have returned to India from Bangladesh through various land transit points or by flight. External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar said the Foreign Ministry is fully focused on ensuring safety and well-being of the Indians in Bangladesh.</li>
	<li>The US State Department has warned Americans not to travel to Bangladesh and said it would begin removing some diplomats and their families from the country roiled by deadly civil unrest.</li>
	<li>Violence escalated in Bangladesh's capital Dhaka and elsewhere&nbsp;over protests by students, demanding reforms to the quota system for government jobs.</li>
	<li>The protesters are demanding an end to a quota system that reserves up to 30% of government jobs for relatives of veterans who fought in Bangladesh's war of independence in 1971 against Pakistan.</li>
	<li>The quotas have caused anger among students who face high youth unemployment rates, with nearly 32 million young Bangladeshis not in work or education out of a total population of 170 million people.</li>

       <description><![CDATA[Collins Jumaisi Khalusha, 33, has been described as a "psychopathic serial killer who has no respect for human life." Khalusha's horrific acts have come to light amidst political turmoil and a rising wave of gender-based violence in the country.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When his house was searched, police found a machete, industrial rubber gloves, rolls of Sellotape, and nylon sacks, among other things. The man to whom this house belonged has confessed to killing 42 women, including his wife, and mutilating many of his victims, stuffing the body parts in sacks and dumping them in a scrapyard in Kenya's capital Nairobi.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/20/world/africa/nairobi-kenya-serial-killer.html">Collins Jumaisi Khalusha</a>, 33, has been described as a "vampire" and a "psychopathic serial killer who has no respect for human life." Khalusha's horrific acts have come to light amidst political turmoil and a rising wave of gender-based violence in the country.</p>

<h3><strong>The Discovery</strong></h3>

<p>The grisly discovery began when dismembered bodies of nine women were found at an abandoned quarry used as a rubbish dump in Nairobi's Mukuru slums. This site, a dumping ground for local residents, became the final resting place for many of Khalusha's alleged victims.</p>

<p>The suspect, who lived in a nearby decrepit room, confessed to luring, killing, and disposing of his victims on the ground.</p>

<h3><strong>The Arrest</strong></h3>

<p>The Kenyan police arrested Khalusha days after the discovery. Prosecutors confirmed that Khalusha had confessed to the murders, including that of his wife. The victims were killed between 2022 and the date of Khalusha's arrest.</p>

<p>At Khalusha's residence, detectives found several mobile phones, identity cards, and nylon sacks similar to those used to wrap the victims' bodies. This evidence pointed to a methodical and premeditated series of killings, which has prompted some to dub him the "Kenyan Ted Bundy".&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>The Victims</strong></h3>

<p>Among the victims was Josephine Owino, a 26-year-old hair braider from Mukuru Kwa Njenga. Owino disappeared after receiving a phone call one morning. Her sister, Peris Keya, searched for her, eventually reaching the dumping ground, where she convinced local men to search for bodies. Their efforts uncovered sacks containing mutilated remains.</p>

<p>Forensic examination of the bodies revealed shocking details. According to Dr Johansen Oduor, a government pathologist, most sacks contained amputated limbs and torsos. Only one intact body was found, and none of the corpses bore bullet wounds. One victim had been strangled. DNA analysis has identified two of the bodies, though many remain unidentified due to advanced decomposition.</p>

<h3><strong>Police Scrutiny And A Big Allegation</strong></h3>

<p>The Kenyan police force has been criticised for failing to act on reports of missing women. The fact that the dumping ground is situated near a police station has raised questions about police oversight and competence.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The revelation of these murders has rattled Kenya, a country already dealing with political unrest and economic challenges. Protests against tax hikes and government corruption have been widespread, with many fearing that the authorities are using Khalusha's case to divert attention from political issues. This skepticism is fueled by Khalusha's lawyer, John Maina Ndegwa, who claims that his client was abused by officers and coerced into confessing.</p>

<p>During his first court appearance, his lawyer demanded that Khalusha receive medical attention, alleging mistreatment by the police. The court has granted an extension for Khalusha's detention, allowing investigators more time to build their case.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden, who tested positive for COVID-19 last week, has been "tolerating" treatment well and continuing his presidential duties, according to the White House physician.</p>

<p>In a memorandum to White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on Saturday, Dr Kevin C. O'Connor, the physician to the president, said genomic sequencing has determined that Biden has been afflicted by the KP .2.3 variant that accounts for around 33.3 per cent of new infections in the United States.</p>

<p>"President Biden completed his sixth dose of PAXLOVID this morning. He is still experiencing a loose, non-productive cough and hoarseness, but his symptoms continue to improve steadily," Dr O'Connor said.</p>

<p>His pulse, blood pressure, respiratory rate and temperature remain absolutely normal, his oxygen saturation continues to be excellent on room air and his lungs remain clear, Dr O'Connor said.</p>

<p>"The president continues to tolerate treatment well and will continue PAXLOVID (anti-Covid pill) as planned. He continues to perform all of his presidential duties," the doctor said.</p>

<p>Biden tested positive for COVID-19 on July 17 which led to halting his campaign at a critical juncture in the presidential election when he was facing increasing pressure about his health and concerns about his viability as a candidate. He returned to his home in Delaware and isolated himself.</p>

<p>It's unclear where and when the president contracted COVID-19. But the sudden diagnosis has placed him behind closed doors at a time when Democratic lawmakers have been clamouring to see him out front.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The US homeland security chief hit back Saturday at misogynistic attacks on the women Secret Service agents who threw themselves into the line of fire to protect Donald Trump from a would-be assassin.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US homeland security chief hit back Saturday at <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/women-shouldnt-be-in-secret-service-says-us-right-wing-post-donald-trump-shooting-6124419">misogynistic attacks on the women Secret Service agents</a> who threw themselves into the line of fire to protect Donald Trump from a would-be assassin.</p>

<p>"These assertions are baseless and insulting," Alejandro Mayorkas said in a statement after the some on the US political right accused the Secret Service of "woke" hiring practices they say nearly got the former president killed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He praised the "highly skilled and trained" women serving at every level of law enforcement across the country for risking "their lives on the front lines for the safety and security of others."</p>

<p>"They are brave and selfless patriots who deserve our gratitude and respect," he wrote.</p>

<p>The Department of Homeland Security will "with great pride, focus and devotion to mission, continue to recruit, retain and elevate women in our law enforcement ranks. Our Department will be the better for it, and our country more secure," he continued.</p>

<p>In the week since a gunman opened fire during a Trump rally in Pennsylvania, killing one bystander, wounding two others and leaving the Republican bloodied but alive, right-wingers have unleashed a torrent of criticism on the Secret Service for having women in its ranks.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Several women can be seen among the black-suited, sunglasses-clad agents racing to shield Trump with their bodies as the gunshots ring out at the rally, before hustling him from the stage and into a waiting car and safety.</p>

<p>But they, along with their boss Kimberly Cheatle -- only the second-ever woman director of the federal agency tasked with protecting presidents current, former and would-be -- are now caught in the intense scrutiny over the nearly catastrophic attack.</p>

<p>"There should not be any women in the Secret Service. These are supposed to be the very best, and none of the very best at this job are women," right-wing activist Matt Walsh wrote on X, in one typical post.</p>

<p>Many of the attacks cited DEI -- diversity, equity and inclusivity -- hiring practices that some Republicans have long criticized as discriminating against white people, white men in particular.</p>

<p>"The results of DEI. DEI got someone killed," read one post on the popular Libs of TikTok account.</p>

<p>The Secret Service has defended itself against such accusations in the past, with a spokesman telling US media just weeks before the assassination attempt that agents "are held to the highest professional standards... at no time has the agency lowered these standards."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump held his first campaign rally on Saturday since he narrowly escaped an assassination attempt one week ago, mocking Democrats and at one point comparing former Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to a "dog."</p>

<p>Trump, who called for national unity in a speech on Thursday as he accepted his party's presidential nomination at the Republican National Convention, made no mention of that in his remarks before a raucous crowd of supporters in Grand Rapids.</p>

<p>He frequently mocked Democratic President Joe Biden as feeble. He derided senior Democrats, including Pelosi, for trying to persuade Biden to end his re-election bid.</p>

<p>Referring to Pelosi, Trump said: "She's turned on him like a dog. She's as crazy as a bed bug."</p>

<p>The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Trump comparing Pelosi to a dog.</p>

<p>Fresh from his nominating convention where his takeover of the Republican Party was cemented, Trump appeared in Grand Rapids with his new vice presidential pick, Senator J.D. Vance from Ohio. They took the stage in their first campaign event together with the Republican Party unified behind them.</p>

<p>In contrast, it is no longer certain that President Joe Biden will be the Democratic Party's nominee facing Trump in the Nov. 5 election.</p>

<p>Biden has faced calls from some senior Democrats to end his re-election bid after his poor debate performance last month raised concerns over whether he could beat Trump or complete another four-year term.</p>

<p>Trump attacked Democrats, saying they wanted to kick Biden off the ticket after he won their presidential nominating contest.</p>

<p>"They have a couple of problems. No. 1, they have no idea who their candidate is," Trump said to laughter and jeers. "This guy goes and he gets the votes and now they want to take it away."</p>

<p>"As you're seeing, the Democrat Party is not the party of democracy. They're really the enemies of democracy."</p>

<p>He added: "And they keep saying, 'He's a threat to democracy.' I'm saying, 'What the hell did I do for democracy?'</p>

<p>Last week, I took a bullet for democracy."</p>

<p>Trump referred to the assassination attempt several times on Saturday. "I hope I don't have to go through that again. It was so horrible," Trump said.</p>

<p>Opinion polls show a tight race between the Trump and Biden at a national level but Biden trailing Trump in the battleground states that will likely determine the winner.</p>

<p>Many Democrats fear he may not have a realistic path to victory and that the party needs a new candidate to take on Trump.</p>

<p>There was a heavy police presence at Trump's rally in Grand Rapids on Saturday, with police on every street corner for several blocks.</p>

<p>U.S. Secret Service officers were positioned on the top balconies in the Van Andel Arena, giving them a bird's eye view of the crowd inside.</p>

<p>Bag searches for those entering the indoor arena earlier in the day were long and thorough, and the Secret Service sweep of the building took about an hour longer than usual.</p>

<p>The rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, last weekend was outdoors. At that event, the gunman was able to scale the roof of a building outside the Secret Service perimeter before opening fire on Trump, clipping his ear, killing a rally-goer and wounding several others.</p>

<p>The Secret Service, which is responsible for protecting Trump, declined to comment on security for the Grand Rapids event. An investigation is under way into the security failures at the Butler rally.</p>

<p>Trump gave a detailed account of his narrow brush with death in his convention speech on Thursday, telling the audience that he was only talking to them "by the grace of Almighty God."</p>

<p>Trump's former physician, Ronny Jackson, said on Saturday that the former president is recovering as expected from the gunshot wound to his right ear, but noted intermittent bleeding and said Trump may require a hearing exam.</p>

<p>The bullet fired by the would-be assassin at the July 13 rally in Pennsylvania came "less than a quarter of an inch from entering his head," said Jackson, a Republican congressman from Texas who had served as physician to Presidents Trump and Barack Obama.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

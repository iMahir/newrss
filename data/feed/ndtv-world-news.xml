       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A tech entrepreneur from Utah finds himself coming to terms with the ramifications of a decision he made back in 2008. Chris Willson purchased a historic cruise ship after discovering a listing on Craigslist. This purchase led to a 15-year journey of passionate restoration, transforming the 293-foot vessel into a treasure that boasted 85 cabins, a swimming pool, and a theatre. However, despite his efforts and dreams of establishing a museum aboard, Mr Willson was forced to sell the ship in October 2023 - a decision that continues to "haunt" him.</p>

<p>The ship, originally named Wappen von Hamburg and built in 1955, had a storied history as one of Germany's first post-World War II passenger liners. Feeling inspired, Mr Willson bought the vessel and 'sank' his life savings - over $1 million - into the project.</p>

<p>Renaming it Aurora, he relocated it to California and moved aboard with his partner, Jin Li. He dedicated years to its renovation. With the help of volunteers, he made substantial progress, restoring 10 major areas of the ship. Mr Willson's goal was to turn Aurora into a floating museum.</p>

<p>However, Chris Willson's dream of transforming the vessel into a museum met with resistance from locals. His restoration project did not sit right with residents, particularly after another nearby ship, the Canadian minesweeper HMCS Chaleur, sank in 2021.</p>

<p>In January 2023, a military tugboat docked near the Aurora also sank, sparking a pollution issue that attracted the attention of local authorities. With the pressure mounting, Mr Willson and his partner realised they could no longer sustain the project.</p>

<p>"Maybe Aurora wasn't in the right place," Ms Li told CNN. "Maybe if Aurora was in a different state, or a different country it would have been different."</p>

<p>In late 2023, Mr Willson made the difficult decision to sell the ship. While he believed the buyer shared his passion for preserving the Aurora, disaster struck just seven months later.</p>

<p>In May 2024, the San Joaquin County Sheriff's Office reported that the Aurora was sinking. A hole in the vessel caused it to take on water, leaking diesel fuel and oil into the Delta Waterway. Contractors hired by the US Coast Guard managed to refloat the ship, but it was clear the vessel's future was bleak.</p>

<p>"I meticulously maintained that ship," Mr Willson told CNN, shocked over the sinking. "We had it for 15 years, and we had no problem with it."</p>

<p>"It haunts me, and I lose sleep over it," he said.</p>

<p>Today, the city of Stockton is managing the operation to remove the Aurora, though no clear ownership of the ship exists. Chris Willson, who built a large following on YouTube around the restoration project, continues to reflect on his time with the ship, describing it as one of the most fulfilling experiences of his life despite the unfortunate outcome. "I don't have any regrets on what I've done," he said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli forces today began "ground raids" in southern Lebanese villages, targeting Hezbollah strongholds. As the Israeli invasion begins, the ghost of past incursions into the Levantine nation is still fresh in the minds of its citizens. The last invasion, the 2006 Lebanon War, was a 34-day conflict that exposed military, political, and strategic gaps on both sides. The Israeli forces, initially confident in their superiority, were soon bogged down by Hezbollah's guerilla tactics, leading to heavy losses and a stalemate that both sides declared as a victory.</p>

<p>Now, nearly two decades later, Israel's military appears to have internalised the lessons from that conflict, preparing for what may be the most decisive military engagement in its history with Hezbollah, whose leader Hassan Nasrallah was killed in an airstrike in Beirut two days ago.</p>

<h2><strong>1982: The First Invasion</strong></h2>

<p>Israel's invasion of Lebanon in 1982 which gave birth to Hezbollah, was born out of the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982. With Israel pushing into Lebanese territory, particularly in the country's eastern Bekaa region, Hezbollah emerged as a resistance force with the backing of Iran's Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC). Over time, Hezbollah would become one of the most formidable non-state actors in the Middle East and a persistent thorn in Israel's side.</p>

<p>Three years later, in 1985, Hezbollah took a more formal shape with the establishment of its military arm, the Islamic Resistance in Lebanon. Early operations focused on suicide bombings and guerrilla warfare, particularly targeting Israeli forces in the south, often in coordination with the South Lebanon Army (SLA), a mostly Christian militia allied with Israel.</p>

<h2><strong>The 2006 Lebanon War</strong></h2>

<p>The 2006 Lebanon War began on July 12, when Hezbollah fighters staged a cross-border raid, capturing two Israeli soldiers and killing three others. What followed was an escalation of military conflict that saw Israeli forces pushing into southern Lebanon to confront Hezbollah. However, from the outset, Israel's military faced unexpected resistance.</p>

<p>Less than a mile into Lebanese territory, Israeli soldiers found themselves entangled in fierce battles with Hezbollah. The 34-day conflict witnessed the deaths of 121 Israeli soldiers, the destruction of several tanks by shoulder-fired missiles, and Hezbollah's continued ability to launch rocket attacks into Israel.</p>

<p>Former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, who led the country during the war, later reflected on the conflict's shortcomings, stating that the Israeli army had been unprepared for a comprehensive ground operation. The Winograd Commission, a government-appointed body tasked with evaluating the war's outcome, accused the Israeli leadership of rushing into a poorly planned operation. Intelligence failures, logistical missteps, and underestimating Hezbollah's capabilities led to what the commission described as a "serious, missed opportunity" to deal a more decisive blow to the militant group.</p>

<p>Despite these setbacks, the war officially ended with both Israel and Hezbollah claiming victory. Israel's military had inflicted significant damage on Hezbollah, while Hezbollah managed to withstand the assault and continue launching attacks until the ceasefire brokered by the United Nations took effect.</p>

<h2><strong>Learning From The Past</strong></h2>

<p>Today, as Israeli forces prepare for another potential invasion of Lebanon, the lessons of 2006 are key to their strategy. In recent weeks, Israel has employed a pre-emptive approach, targeting Hezbollah's logistics and communication infrastructure. Key weapons depots have been destroyed, and senior Hezbollah commanders, including Nasrallah, have been eliminated. This decapitation of Hezbollah's leadership has shocked the organisation, which had built its identity around resisting Israeli incursions.</p>

</div>

<p>These attacks are the culmination of years of intelligence gathering and military planning. Unlike in 2006, when Israeli forces struggled to locate and target Hezbollah's positions, Israel today appears to have built a robust intelligence network capable of pinpointing key Hezbollah assets. Military exercises, refined battle plans, and a multilayered air defence system now form the backbone of Israel's defensive and offensive might.</p>

<p>Hezbollah, which has amassed an arsenal of an estimated 150,000 rockets and missiles, has been significantly weakened in recent weeks. With its leadership in disarray and hundreds of its fighters either killed or wounded, it is unclear how effectively the group can mount a challenge.</p>

<h2><strong>Risk Of Regional Escalation</strong></h2>

<p>While Israel's military might has grown significantly since 2006, the landscape of the region has also changed. One of the most pressing concerns for Israel is the possibility of the conflict expanding beyond Lebanon's borders. Hezbollah's ties to Iran, and the growing coordination between Iran-backed militias in Iraq, Syria, and Yemen, present a real risk of the war becoming a regionwide conflagration. Iran's Axis Of Resistance - a collective of armed Shia militias around the Middle East - is capable of launching ballistic missiles into Israel.</p>

<p>Tehran, which has invested heavily in Hezbollah's military infrastructure over the past two decades, may not sit idly by if Israel continues its offensive. In such a scenario, the risk of Iranian forces or their proxies becoming directly involved in the conflict increases, potentially drawing the United States and other regional powers into the fray.</p>

<h2><strong>Challenges Of A Ground Invasion</strong></h2>

<p>A ground invasion of Lebanon comes with significant risks. Hezbollah, while weakened, still poses a threat to Israeli forces, particularly in close-quarters combat. Over the years, Hezbollah has developed extensive defensive infrastructure, including tunnels, bunkers, and fortified positions, which could turn any ground operation into a prolonged and bloody conflict - as evident from Israel's ongoing war in Gaza where they have faced similar threats.</p>

</div>

<p>Hezbollah's fighters are also battle-hardened from their involvement in Syria's civil war, where they fought alongside Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's forces against a variety of rebel groups.</p>

<p>Adding to these challenges is the terrain of southern Lebanon, a region that Hezbollah knows intimately. The dense urban and mountainous landscapes provide ample cover for guerrilla fighters, making it difficult for Israeli forces to engage Hezbollah without suffering significant casualties.</p>

<h2><strong>Hezbollah's Response</strong></h2>

<p>Hezbollah, for its part, has also learned from its past encounters with Israel. Following the 2006 conflict, former Hezbollah leader Hasan Nasrallah admitted that the group had miscalculated Israel's response to its cross-border raid. In the years since, with the backing of Iran, Hezbollah has bolstered its military capabilities. It has amassed a vast arsenal of rockets, missiles, and drones, while also constructing elaborate defences in southern Lebanon.</p>

<p>However, with Nasrallah and other senior Hezbollah commanders now dead, the organisation's ability to coordinate a coherent response to Israel's strikes is in question. The extent to which Hezbollah can resist Israel's military onslaught may ultimately depend on Iran's role in the conflict. Tehran has long used Hezbollah as a proxy to exert influence in the region and challenge Israeli power. With Hezbollah now reeling from Israel's recent attacks, Iran may seek to provide additional support to prevent the collapse of its most important ally in the Levant.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Wanted for alleged money laundering charges, controversial Islamic preacher Zakir Naik has arrived in Pakistan on Monday morning at the invitation of the Government of Pakistan, amid tight security for his lecture series at Islamabad, Karachi and Lahore.</p>

<p>According to the Express Tribune, he is set to have public interactions across the country. He is accompanied by his son, Fariq Naik, who is an Islamic scholar and will tour the country with him for the lectures.</p>

<p>Upon his arrival at the New Islamabad Airport, he was received by leaders from the top echelons of the Pakistan government, which included the Chairman of the Pakistan Prime Minister's Youth Program, Rana Mashhood and Additional Secretary of the Ministry of Religious Affairs, Syed Atta-ur-Rehman, as reported by the Tribune.</p>

<p>Official sources note that his month-long tour will include meetings with senior government officials and involve participation in various public events.</p>

<p>In a post on X, Zakir Naik's team announced," On the invitation of the Government of Pakistan Dr Zakir Naik &amp; Shaikh Fariq Naik's Pakistan Tour 2024 Public Talks: Karachi - 5th &amp; 6th Oct Lahore - 12th &amp; 13th Oct Islamabad - 19th &amp; 20th Oct."</p>

<p>Earlier on August 20, while on a visit to India, Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said that if sufficient evidence is presented in the case related to fugitive preacher Zakir Naik then the country will 'not condone terrorism'.</p>

<p>Addressing the 50th Sapru House Lecture the Malaysian Prime Minister said, "I am talking about sentiment of extremism, of compelling case, evidence that suggest that atrocities committed by an individual, group or factions or parties. These are of concern to us."</p>

<p>Zakir Naik is known for his inflammatory speeches and is currently wanted by the National Investigation Agency of the Government of India under a 2016 money laundering case. He is also alleged to have incited people by his hate speech.</p>

<p>Naik runs a channel by the name PeaceTV, which is banned across India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka due to its controversial nature and he has also been denied entry into Canada and the United Kingdom because of it.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Google plans to invest $1 billion to build digital infrastructure in Thailand, including a new data centre, the US tech giant has announced, saying the move would support 14,000 jobs in the kingdom.</p>

<p>The new hubs in Bangkok and the industrial area of Chonburi are intended to help meet the growing demand for cloud computing in Southeast Asia, the company said in a Monday statement.</p>

<p>Google's investment comes after Microsoft announced in May that it would create Thailand's first data centre region to boost cloud and artificial intelligence infrastructure.</p>

<p>"These investments will empower Thai businesses, innovators, and communities to harness the power of cloud and AI technology," Ruth Porat, president and chief investment officer of Google and its parent company Alphabet, said.</p>

<p>The investment's details were unveiled after a Bangkok meeting between Porat and Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra, who hailed the move as proof Thailand was becoming a major digital hub in Southeast Asia.</p>

<p>The data centre will be located in Chonburi, a major industrial area southeast of Bangkok, while the cloud facilities will be in the capital itself.</p>

<p>Google's expansion in Thailand will add $4 billion to the kingdom's GDP by 2029 and support 14,000 jobs between 2025 and 2029, the company said, citing a report from consultancy Deloitte.</p>

<p>The announcement comes a year after Shinawatra's predecessor Srettha Thavisin made a major push for investment from US tech giants during a trip to New York, seeking finance from Google, Microsoft and Elon Musk's Tesla.</p>

<p>Thailand is Southeast Asia's second-largest economy, but its tech sector has lagged behind the likes of Singapore and Indonesia.</p>

<p>The Thai economy, long focused on traditional manufacturing, agriculture and tourism, has struggled to bounce back from the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>The government hopes investment from Google, Microsoft and their ilk will diversify and modernise the kingdom's economy.</p>

<p>Thailand's Office of the National Digital Economy and Society Commission has said the digital economy could contribute as much as 30 per cent of GDP by 2027.</p>

<p>Across the region, governments are vying for US tech dollars, with Vietnam making a drive to move up the value chain from its traditional base as a hub for producing shoes, clothes and furniture.</p>

<p>Vietnam hopes to cash in on the US move to become less dependent on China for key resources including high-tech chips.</p>

<p>And last week, Vietnamese state media reported that Musk's SpaceX plans to invest $1.5 billion in the communist country.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[After centuries of decline, concerted conservation efforts have led to a remarkable resurgence of the Northern Bald Ibis in Europe.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After over three centuries of absence in Europe, the northern bald ibis, once thought to exist only in drawings, has made a comeback. This bird, with its glossy plumage and distinctive curved beak, once thrived across three continents and held symbolic significance in ancient cultures, where it even had its own hieroglyph symbolising the word "spirit."</p>

<p>However, by the late 20th century, the species dwindled to just 59 breeding pairs, all confined to Morocco. Human activities, including hunting, habitat destruction and pesticide use, drove the bird to the edge of extinction. Yet, through dedicated conservation efforts, the northern bald ibis is now clawing its way back from near oblivion, according to a report in CNN.</p>

<h3><strong>Conservation success in Morocco</strong></h3>

<p>The remaining wild population of northern bald ibises is primarily found in Morocco, where conservation initiatives have stabilised their numbers. In 1991, the establishment of the Souss-Massa National Park on Morocco's west coast provided much-needed protection for the bird's breeding and feeding habitats. A research programme launched in 1994 helped monitor the population, leading to a significant recovery. Today, there are over 500 individuals in the wild, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has downgraded the species' status from "critically endangered" to "endangered."</p>

<p>These birds, which prefer to nest in cliffs, rocky outcrops and even urban ruins, are adaptive foragers. Their diet consists mainly of insects and larvae, though they are forced to adapt to the remote and changing nature of their habitats.</p>

<h3><strong>Comeback in Europe</strong></h3>

<p>Though the Moroccan population was always thriving, the species long disappeared from its European range. Projects to reintroduce the northern bald ibis to Europe have now begun yielding results, stated the CNN report. One of the most notable efforts is underway in Spain, where a programme in Andalusia has successfully reintroduced birds into the wild. Hand-reared by human 'parents,' the chicks are gradually released into their natural habitat. This initiative, which began in 2004, has helped re-establish the species in southern Europe.</p>

<p>In Austria and Germany, a programme led by Austrian biologist Johannes Fritz is taking a unique approach to reintroducing a migratory population. The birds, raised in captivity and lacking the knowledge of migratory routes, are taught to migrate by following a tiny aircraft. As the ultralight aircraft soars through the sky, human foster parents cheer and wave from the back, offering encouragement to the birds in flight, reported The Guardian.</p>

<p>At the controls is Fritz, piloting the aircraft equipped with a small fan motor at the rear and a yellow parachute to keep it airborne. Since 2003, Fritz and his team have guided northern bald ibises from Germany to southern Europe in this manner. The birds now follow a route that has recently been adjusted to end in Spain due to environmental changes.</p>

<h3><strong>Challenges and threats</strong></h3>

<p>While conservation efforts have brought some success, the northern bald ibis still faces a few challenges. Threats such as poaching, pesticides and climate change continue to jeopardise their survival. In 2023, poaching alone accounted for the loss of 17 per cent&nbsp;of migrating birds in Europe. The changing climate is also forcing the ibises to adjust their migration patterns, and the timing of their journeys has had to shift to account for altered environmental conditions.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An 80-year-old South Korean model has made history, becoming the oldest contestant in the Miss Universe Korea pageant. Choi Soon-hwa, with her white hair and youthful spirit, stands out among her fellow contestants -- many decades younger -- but she is determined to prove age is just a number.</p>

<p>Born in 1943, nearly a decade before the first Miss Universe pageant in 1952, Ms Choi is set to make history if she wins the title and represents South Korea at the Miss Universe final in Mexico this November. She will compete against 31 other women for the crown on Monday.</p>

<p>Despite her age, Ms Choi is confident in her abilities and excited for the upcoming contest. "I want to stun the world, like, 'How is an 80-year-old lady so healthy? How did she maintain that body? What's your diet?'" Ms Choi told CNN.</p>

<p>Ms Choi's participation comes after the Miss Universe Organisation, responding to calls for modernisation, lifted the upper age limit, previously capped at 28. "Now that the age restriction has been lifted, I said, 'I should give it a try,'" she said.</p>

<p>Ms Choi's late entry into pageantry follows a successful career in modelling. After facing financial difficulties in her 50s, she worked as a hospital carer before pursuing modelling at the age of 72. Encouraged by a patient, she began training and eventually made her runway debut at Seoul Fashion Week when she was 74. Since then, Ms Choi has appeared in magazines like Harper's Bazaar and Elle and even starred in commercials for popular South Korean brands.</p>

<p>"Becoming a model was like opening a door to a new path for me," Ms Choi told CNN.</p>

<p>The Miss Universe Korea pageant, which takes place on Monday, will include a variety of performances, with Ms Choi participating in a singing contest. The competition will be judged on both outer and inner beauty, with online voting also factoring into the final decision.</p>

<p>Should she win, Choi Soon-hwa would become the oldest contestant ever to compete in the global Miss Universe pageant.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The military flyover is ready, the songs have been rehearsed: Plains, Georgia is waiting to celebrate Jimmy Carter's 100th birthday on Tuesday when its hometown hero becomes the only ever US president to reach the centennial mark.</p>

<p>Carter's longevity -- he announced he was going into hospice care more than 19 months ago -- has defied all expectations.</p>

<p>The former peanut farmer and onetime Georgia governor, known for a strong sense of modest decency, returned post-presidency to the rural hamlet -- with a population of approximately 600 -- and has remained a steady and celebrated presence here since.</p>

<p>No longer regularly appearing in public -- his last trip out was to see Independence Day fireworks in July -- the Democratic ex-president will spend his birthday in the home he and his late wife Rosalynn had built in Plains in the 1960s.</p>

<p>It will include a lunch with some 20 members of his extended family, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.</p>

<p>"We are thrilled that the president from this little town is going to be the only president to ever live to be 100 years old," Jill Stuckey, superintendent of the National Park Service's Jimmy Carter historical site and longtime family friend, told AFP.</p>

<p>She spoke from Plains High School, where Carter graduated in 1941 and which now serves as the visitors centre for the national park that features sites from his early life, such as the nearby peanut farm where he grew up.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, the school will hold not just an evening concert featuring local and other musicians but also a naturalization ceremony for 100 new US citizens.</p>

<p>The flyover, which includes four Navy F-18s, according to Stuckey, is particularly fitting since Carter worked on the Navy's nuclear submarine program, rising to the rank of lieutenant. He should be able to see it from home.</p>

<p>Tributes for the former US leader have already begun pouring in, with President Joe Biden calling Carter "a moral force for our nation and the world" in a video statement on CBS over the weekend.</p>

<p>"Your commitment to a better world, and your unwavering belief in the power of human goodness continues to be a guiding light for all of us," Biden said.</p>

<p>Beyond serving as president for a single term from 1977 to 1981, Carter worked as a global mediator, rights activist and elder statesman, founding the well-respected Carter Center in 1982 to pursue his vision of world diplomacy.</p>

<p>His presidency included the 1978 Camp David Accords between Israel and Egypt, the establishment of diplomatic relations with China following a rapprochement initiated by President Richard Nixon, and the return of control of the Panama Canal to Panama.</p>

<p>But his administration hit numerous snags, including the Iran hostage crisis and a renewed oil crisis in 1979-1980.</p>

<p>A devout Baptist and self-described "born-again" Christian, Carter is remembered for a moralistic streak, but also civility admired even by detractors across the aisle.</p>

<p>"Healthy habits and his faith are a lot of the reasons why he is still with it today," Stuckey said, referencing Carter's penchant for fresh food and exercise.</p>

<h3><strong>'Always' political&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>According to family, Carter remains keenly interested in politics and was highly motivated to make it to 100 to vote in the November election for fellow Democrat Kamala Harris.</p>

<p>"He will be voting by mail-in ballot," Stuckey told AFP, adding "he's always been very politically active, and nothing has changed with that respect."</p>

<p>In Plains, like in many rural places with strong evangelical Christian leanings, far more yard signs support Republican Donald Trump than Harris.</p>

<p>However, it is also not uncommon to see a sign celebrating Carter's centennial birthday next to one supporting Trump.</p>

<p>Carl Lowell, who has lived in Plains since infancy, said he tries not to get involved in politics because it is "so divisive" right now.</p>

<p>Like most residents of Plains, he is linked to Carter in various ways -- he says his grandfather helped build the Carters' house and that he himself even went dove hunting with him once.</p>

<p>"Jimmy's a good man, he's a godly man, and that's what people like about him," the 59-year-old retired firefighter said.</p>

<p>For 72-year-old Inez Battle, Carter's work establishing the Boys and Girls Club in Plains was particularly meaningful.</p>

<p>He did it, she said, specifically for the community's African American children "to have somewhere to go and learn after school."</p>

<p>The battle, a board member of the organization, remembers fondly how he would attend meetings: "Instead of him saying we'll do this, he would ask your opinion," she told AFP.</p>

<p>As for his 100th birthday, Battle said, "It's a blessing."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sean 'Diddy' Combs' attorney plans to file an appeal to get him released from prison, according to court documents obtained by 'People' on Monday.</p>

<p>Combs' lawyer, Alexandra Shapiro, filed a notice on Monday stating their intent to appeal after Combs was denied bail twice. A source close to Combs told 'People' that the official appeal brief will be submitted soon.</p>

<p>The music mogul was arrested at a Manhattan hotel on September 16 at 8:25 pm. The next day, a 14-page indictment was unsealed, revealing the charges against him. He is accused of allegedly organizing several "freak offs," which prosecutors described as "elaborate and produced sex performances." He also allegedly drugged and sexually assaulted his victims.</p>

<p>On September 18, Combs was denied bail for the second time and is currently being held at Brooklyn's Metropolitan Detention Center.</p>

<p>Judge Robyn F. Tarnofsky, who denied his bail on September 17, cited concerns about his alleged "substance abuse and what seems like anger issues. I don't know that you can trust yourself" not to harm others," she said.</p>

<p>According to PEOPLE, Combs is reportedly no longer on suicide watch.</p>

<p>"He is focused and very strong. He is concentrating on his defence and preparing for his trial," a lawyer for Combs told PEOPLE.</p>

<p>Combs' next court appearance is scheduled for early October.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An Idaho high school teacher has been sentenced to a minimum of two years and up to 20 years in prison after pleading guilty to sexual battery of a minor. Jessica Lawson, 36, admitted to two counts of sexual battery as part of a plea agreement, according to court records. As part of the deal, additional charges for providing alcohol to a minor and delivering a controlled substance were dismissed, the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/09/30/us-news/idaho-teacher-sentenced-for-sexual-battery-rape-of-teen-adopted-by-a-local-family-days-prior/" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>New York Post </em></a>reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Lawson was arrested in St. Anthony, Idaho, in November 2023 when police stopped a car driven by a teenage boy with Lawson in the passenger seat. According to reports from the Idaho State Journal, East Idaho News, and Local News 8, police said Lawson had instructed the boy to drive because she was too "drunk".</p>

<p>The car was initially pulled over for a broken taillight, and the boy reportedly confessed to possessing marijuana. The boy's parents later informed police that Lawson had picked him up the previous night, and he admitted to receiving alcohol and marijuana from her before they engaged in sexual activity.</p>

<p>Lawson, a former teacher at South Fremont High School, will serve at least two years in prison. She was also issued a 20-year no-contact order with the victim, according to East Idaho News.</p>

<p>"It takes a village to raise a young man, especially a young man that has been in and out of foster care, that has never known what it's like to have a mom and a dad," the father told the court, according to East Idaho News.</p>

<p>"My son is going to take a long time to heal and he doesn't even know the wounds that he has yet. He's not going to understand those wounds until he's a parent and he's sending his daughter or son ... to the house of a parent that he trusts."</p>

<p>The teen's mother said that struggles to differentiate between safe and unsafe situations because of his time in the foster home.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We brought [my son] in because he needed somebody, and he didn't have anybody ... It was pretty quick that we realized this is a really great kid, and he's wonderful and he should be in our family," the mother told the court.</p>

<p>"He's got a lot of problems because he didn't have a mom and dad that taught him how to recognize safe people. And you took advantage of that ... she knew she could get something from him."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Despite US calls to avert a ground offensive in Lebanon, Israel has begun "targeted" raids on the country -- more proof that Washington has been unable to rein in its ally, amid fears of a wider Middle East conflict.</p>

<p>The US president indicated Monday that he was opposed to Israeli ground operations in Lebanon, calling for a ceasefire as tensions spiralled after the assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah.</p>

<p>"I'm more aware than you might know and I'm comfortable with them stopping. We should have a ceasefire now," Biden told reporters when asked if he was aware of Israeli plans for a limited operation on Lebanese soil.</p>

<p>A few hours later, State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said Israel had informed Washington that it was currently conducting "limited operations targeting Hezbollah infrastructure near the border."</p>

<p>And the Israeli military confirmed early Tuesday that it had indeed launched "ground raids" on villages in southern Lebanon.</p>

<p>It felt like deja vu all over again.</p>

<p>Every time the United States calls for a negotiated solution or a ceasefire, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu seems to respond by ramping up his military offensive.</p>

<p>Last week, with the ink barely dry on a joint US-French statement on the sidelines of a top-level UN summit for a three-week ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah, Netanyahu announced fresh air strikes against the Iran-backed militant group the very next day.</p>

<p>"The Biden administration has largely been a bystander to these events -- one that has supplied Israel with the military means to conduct these operations but has been repeatedly caught by surprise by its actions," wrote Brian Katulis, a senior fellow for US foreign policy at the Middle East Institute.</p>

<p>On Friday at the United Nations, the contrast was jarring: as Netanyahu authorized a strike against Nasrallah, risking a broader regional conflict, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken again called for all sides to choose diplomacy.</p>

<p>"The question is not, does Israel have a right to deal with existential threats to its security and enemies across its borders with the avowed intent to destroy Israel? Of course, it does.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"But the question is what is the best way to achieve its objectives," Blinken said, echoing the US position expressed shortly after Hamas attacked Israel on October 7 last year.</p>

<h3><strong>Israel seeks to capitalize</strong></h3>

<p>Of course, there are no tears in Washington over Nasrallah's demise. Blinken called him a "brutal terrorist" on Monday.</p>

<p>But the United States has been at pains to say it was neither consulted nor aware of Israel's plans to target him ahead of time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It made a similar statement after Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh was killed in Iran in late July in an attack blamed on Israel.</p>

<p>Now, Israel clearly appears to be seeking to capitalize on its position, having done significant damage to Hezbollah in a series of attacks, and sending Hamas reeling in Gaza, diplomats say.</p>

<p>Washington meanwhile is still hoping that diplomacy will prevail, both in Gaza and Lebanon.</p>

<p>Diplomacy remains "the best and only path to achieving greater stability in the Middle East," and Washington is "committed to urgently driving these efforts forward," Blinken said Monday.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Blinken spoke Sunday with his French counterpart Jean-Noel Barrot, who called on Israel to avoid any ground operation -- a call that apparently went unheeded.</p>

<p>The US secretary of state also talked to Britain's David Lammy on Monday and held talks with counterparts from Arab states on the sidelines of a ministerial meeting in Washington of the international coalition battling the Islamic State group.</p>

<p>Aides to Blinken have long insisted that Washington respects Israel's sovereignty, and tacitly acknowledge that US influence on Netanyahu is limited.</p>

<p>Events on the ground appear to be unfolding at a more rapid pace, and the United States is effectively unable to intercede, meaning Israel's top military and diplomatic ally is on the back foot, merely reacting to the crisis.</p>

<p>Until now, Biden has refused to play the military aid card to force Netanyahu's hand, other than the suspension of one delivery of bombs in May.</p>

<p>The US election calendar has complicated matters, as Vice President Kamala Harris, Biden's heir apparent, is battling for the White House with Republican former president Donald Trump.</p>

<p>The Biden administration hopes to see a Middle East peace deal reached before the election, but few observers believe it is ready to change its strategy so close to Election Day on November 5.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A man killed three people and wounded 15 in a knife attack at a supermarket in the Chinese megacity of Shanghai, police said Tuesday.</p>

<p>The suspected attacker, a 37-year-old man surnamed Lin, was arrested at the supermarket shortly after the incident on Monday night, local police said in a statement.</p>

<p>Police said the man went on the rampage in anger caused by a "personal financial dispute".</p>

<p>The other 15 did not sustain life-threatening wounds.</p>

<p>A Japanese schoolboy in September was stabbed in the southern city of Shenzhen and died of his injuries, prompting outrage from Tokyo.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[In a direct address to the people of Iran, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sent a clear and forceful message on Monday.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a direct address to the people of Iran, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sent a clear and forceful message on Monday. The Israeli leader's speech, delivered in English and subtitled in Persian, conveyed both a warning to the Iranian regime and an assurance to its citizens. The message comes amidst Israel's escalating actions against Iranian-backed groups in the Middle East.</p>

<p>Netanyahu condemned Iran's leadership for allegedly prioritising regional conflicts over its own people's welfare. "Every day, you see a regime that subjugates you make fiery speeches about defending Lebanon, defending Gaza," Netanyahu said, adding that the Iranian government was "plunging the region deeper into darkness and deeper into war."</p>

<p>Referring to Iran's support for Hezbollah and Hamas, groups that have been engaged in violent conflicts with Israel, Netanyahu said that Iran's proxies were being systematically targeted. "Iran's puppets are being eliminated," he said. adding that there was "nowhere we will not go to protect our people."</p>

<p>"With every passing moment, the regime is bringing you - the noble Persian people - closer to the abyss," he said. "The vast majority of Iranians know their regime doesn't care a whit about them. If it did care, if it cared about you, it would stop wasting billions of dollars on futile wars across the Middle East. It would start improving your lives.</p>

<p>"Imagine if all the vast money the regime wasted on nuclear weapons and foreign wars were invested in your children's education, in improving your health care, in building your nation's infrastructure, water, sewage, all the other things that you need. Imagine that."</p>

<p>Netanyahu predicted a future where Iran is free from theocratic rule, envisioning a new era of peace between Israel and Iran. He expressed confidence that change would come "a lot sooner than people think." According to Netanyahu, a post-regime Iran would enjoy prosperity through global investments, tourism, and technological advancements.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"When Iran is finally free - and that moment will come a lot sooner than people think - everything will be different," he said. "Our two ancient peoples, the Jewish people and the Persian people, will finally be at peace. Our two countries, Israel and Iran, will be at peace.</p>

<p>"When that day comes, the terror network that the regime built in five continents will be bankrupt, dismantled. Iran will thrive as never before: Global investment; massive tourism; brilliant technological innovation based on the tremendous talents that exist inside Iran. Doesn't that sound better than endless poverty, repression and war?"</p>

<p>This direct message comes in the wake of Israel's intensified operations against Iranian proxies. Days before Netanyahu's statement, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) executed a major airstrike that killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah at the group's headquarters in Beirut. The strike also reportedly took the life of a senior Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) official. Nasrallah's death has been met with celebration by anti-regime Iranians worldwide.</p>

<p>"You deserve better. Your children deserve better. The entire world deserves better. I know you don't support the rapists and murderers of Hamas and Hezbollah, but your leaders do. You deserve more. The people of Iran should know - Israel stands with you. May we together know a future of prosperity and peace," Netanyahu added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Following Nasrallah's assassination, reports surfaced that Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, was moved to a secure location amid fears of further Israeli action.</p>

<p>The tension between Israel and Iran reached new heights earlier this year when Iran launched over 300 missiles and drones at Israel in retaliation for an alleged Israeli strike in Syria that killed several high-ranking IRGC officers. The vast majority of those missiles were intercepted by Israeli defence systems, with the support of a US-led coalition. Israel responded to Iran's actions with a limited drone strike targeting a nuclear research centre in Isfahan.</p>

<p>Nasrallah's assassination also came amid Israel's campaign against Hezbollah in Lebanon, which has seen frequent cross-border attacks against Israel, allegedly in solidarity with Hamas during its ongoing war with Israel in Gaza. Israel has steadily escalated its strikes on Hezbollah targets, leading to significant losses within the group's leadership. Earlier in the month, mysterious explosions attributed to Israel destroyed Hezbollah's communication devices, injuring thousands and intensifying the ongoing conflict.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A man who tried to breed enormous hybrid sheep using genetic material from endangered animals so he could sell them to trophy hunting ranches has been sentenced to six months in prison, the US Department of Justice said Monday.</p>

<p>Arthur Schubarth, 81, illegally imported parts of the world's largest species of sheep from Kyrgyzstan, which he used to create cloned embryos in the United States.</p>

<p>The resulting embryos were then implanted in ewes on his Montana ranch, resulting in the birth of a genetically pure Marco Polo argali, an endangered species that can weigh more than 300 pounds (135 kilograms) and has horns more than five feet (1.5 meters) wide.</p>

<p>Schubarth then used semen from this specimen to impregnate various species of sheep in an effort to create never-before-seen hybrids, with the goal of breeding even larger sheep.</p>

<p>He hoped to sell the resulting animals to "canned" hunting ranches, facilities where customers pay to shoot captive animals, and where bigger animals can command higher prices.</p>

<p>"Schubarth's criminal conduct is not how Montanans treat our wildlife population," said US Attorney Jesse Laslovich.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Indeed, his actions threatened Montana's native wildlife species for no other reason than he and his co-conspirators wanted to make more money.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Schubarth's greed drove their conspiracy to bring to Montana parts of the largest sheep in the world from Kyrgyzstan.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Such actions to create hybrid animals are as unnatural as they are illegal."</p>

<p>Schubarth, whose ranch breeds and sells mountain sheep, mountain goats and other ungulates primarily for game ranches, admitted one count of conspiracy to violate the Lacey Act, and one of substantively violating the Lacey Act at an earlier hearing.</p>

<p>The Lacey Act prohibits interstate trade in certain wildlife and is used by authorities to combat wildlife trafficking.</p>

<p>In addition to his prison sentence, Schubarth was ordered to pay a $20,000 fine to the Lacey Act Reward Fund, a $4,000 payment to the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation and a $200 special assessment.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Israeli forces have begun "limited, localized, and targeted" ground raids in Lebanon two days after it killed the group's chief Hassan Nasrallah in an airstrike, threatening to worsen the Middle East crisis.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="CetSht_cn">
<ol class="CetSht_ol">
	<li class="CetSht_li">The ground raids target Hezbollah infrastructure in villages in south Lebanon, close to the border, which pose&nbsp;an immediate threat to Israeli communities in northern Israel, said the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF), asserting that&nbsp;Operation "Northern Arrows"&nbsp;will continue in parallel to the fighting in Gaza and in other arenas.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Israel conducted at least six strikes on south Beirut after ordering the residents to evacuate, according to a Lebanese official. A Palestinian camp in south Lebanon was among those hit by the airstrikes, said an official.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Hezbollah's deputy leader Naim Qassem, in his first televised speech since Nasrallah's death, said they were ready if Israel "decides to enter by land". The group has said in a statement they "targeted" Israeli troops in orchards near the Lebanese border.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">World leaders, including the United Nations Secretary-General and US President Joe Biden, had opposed a ground invasion into Lebanon and called for a ceasefire.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Israel and Hezbollah, which runs Lebanon, have been defiant and ignoring global calls for a ceasefire. Israel has been pounding Beirut with airstrikes, killing hundreds of people over the past week and forcing thousands to flee, according to Lebanese officials.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Israeli army ordered people in southern Beirut to evacuate last evening. "You are located near interests and facilities belonging to the terrorist Hezbollah group. For your safety and the safety of your family members, you must evacuate the buildings immediately and stay away from them," said the group's military spokesman Avichay Adraee.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Hassan Nasrallah, who was the chief of Hezbollah, was killed in a massive&nbsp;airstrike on Beirut on Friday. But Israel had vowed the battle was still on. The killing of Nasrallah was "an important step, but not the final one," their defence minister had said.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant had also warned they will use "all the means that may be required" to fight the battle in northern Israel, which shares border with Lebanon - "from the air, from the sea, and on land".</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Meanwhile, three civilians have been killed in Israeli airstrikes on Damascus, according to the state media. The official SANA agency said Israeli warplanes and drones launched attacks from the direction of the Syrian Golan, targeting several points in Damascus.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Israel's war with Hezbollah marks a shift in focus from Gaza, where Hamas operatives have been fighting an Israeli ground operation for months. Iran-backed Hezbollah in Lebanon supports the Palestinian Hamas group.</li>

       <description><![CDATA[The Israeli military said Tuesday troops have started "targeted ground raids" in villages of southern Lebanon.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Israeli military said Tuesday that troops have started "ground raids" in villages in southern Lebanon, after militant group Hezbollah said it had targeted "enemy soldiers" at the countries' border.</p>

<p>A Lebanese security official said Israel had also conducted at least six strikes on south Beirut after Israel's army ordered residents in the Hezbollah stronghold to evacuate.</p>

<p>Despite international calls for de-escalation, Israel earlier vowed to keep fighting Hezbollah and sealed part of the border after killing the Iran-backed group's leader.</p>

<p>Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant warned the battle was not over even after the massive strike on Beirut that killed Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah on Friday, dealing the group a seismic blow.</p>

<p>The military said troops backed by airstrikes and artillery launched ground raids "a few hours ago" targeting militant group Hezbollah "in villages close to the border".</p>

<p>Israel informed its main weapons supplier Washington of the incursions, US State Department spokesman Matthew Miller told journalists.</p>

<p>US President Joe Biden earlier on Monday indicated he opposed an Israeli ground operation.</p>

<p>"We should have a ceasefire now," he said.</p>

<p>Hezbollah fighters were "ready if Israel decides to enter by land", the group's deputy leader Naim Qassem said in a first televised address since Nasrallah's death.</p>

<p>In a statement, Hezbollah said it "targeted" Israeli troops carrying out "movements" in orchards near the border, with a source close to the group saying the soldiers were "right on the border".</p>

<p>There was no immediate comment from Hezbollah following the Israeli army's announcement of the ground raids, but the group's al-Manar television reported the Israeli statement announcing the raids on its Telegram channel.</p>

<p>Lebanon's national army, dwarfed by Hezbollah's military power, was "repositioning" troops farther from the border, a military official told AFP.</p>

<p>World leaders have urged de-escalation, with United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres's spokesman Stephane Dujarric saying: "We do not want any sort of ground invasion."</p>

<p><strong>- Hezbollah 'targets' troops -</strong></p>

<p>Earlier this month, Israel launched a wave of deadly air strikes aimed at Hezbollah across Lebanon, the latest of which killed 95 people on Monday, according to Lebanon's health ministry.</p>

<p>On Monday evening, the Israeli military called on people in three districts of southern Beirut to evacuate.</p>

<p>"You are located near interests and facilities belonging to the terrorist Hezbollah group," Israeli military spokesman Avichay Adraee said.</p>

<p>"For your safety and the safety of your family members, you must evacuate the buildings immediately and stay away from them."</p>

<p>AFP correspondents in the capital heard explosions and saw a flash around ground level.</p>

<p>As Israel announced its ground raids, Syria's official news agency SANA said the country's air defence systems were intercepting "hostile targets" in the Damascus area.</p>

<p>There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military, which has carried out hundreds of strikes on Syria in recent years.</p>

<p><strong>- 'Everyone is afraid' -</strong></p>

<p>He said the killing of Nasrallah was "an important step, but it is not the final one".</p>

<p>Hezbollah began low-intensity strikes on Israeli troops a day after its Palestinian ally Hamas staged its unprecedented attack on Israel on October 7, which triggered Israel's devastating assault on the Gaza Strip.</p>

<p>The border clashes rapidly escalated this month.</p>

<p>On Monday, the Israeli army declared an area of the border strip a "closed military zone".</p>

<p>Israel's strikes on Lebanon have killed hundreds of people over the past week and forced up to a million to flee their homes, according to Lebanese officials.</p>

<p>Hezbollah and other groups launched rockets, drones and some missiles at Israel over the same period, causing some injuries but no deaths.</p>

<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused Iran, which backs Hamas, Hezbollah and other armed groups, of plunging "our region deeper... into war".</p>

<p>"There is nowhere in the Middle East Israel cannot reach," Netanyahu warned.</p>

<p>Iran has said Nasrallah's killing would bring about Israel's "destruction", though the foreign ministry said Monday that Tehran would not deploy any fighters to confront Israel.</p>

<p>Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati called for a ceasefire based on a recent US-French proposal, urging "an end to the Israeli aggression against Lebanon".</p>

<p>Earlier on Monday, an Israeli strike hit a building in central Beirut, with an armed Palestinian group saying it had killed three of its members.</p>

<p>The strike, the first in the city centre in years, sparked panic.</p>

<p>Central Beirut resident Kahier Bannout, 42, said it was "supposed to be a safe area -- not a war zone".</p>

<p><strong>"Everyone is afraid."</strong></p>

<p>Lebanon's Health Minister Firass Abiad said more than 1,000 people have been killed since September 17.</p>

<p>UN refugee agency chief Filippo Grandi said: "Well over 200,000 people are displaced inside Lebanon", while more than 100,000 have fled to neighbouring Syria.</p>

<p>- 'Little time' -</p>

<p>France on Monday evening said it was deploying a naval ship to Lebanon as a "precaution" in case it decided to evacuate French citizens.</p>

<p>Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot, the first high-level diplomat to visit Beirut since the Israeli strikes intensified, said "there is still hope" for a ceasefire, "but there is little time".</p>

<p>US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said diplomacy was the best path forward for the region.</p>

<p>Washington "will continue to work... to advance a diplomatic resolution" for the Israel-Lebanon border, and for a Gaza ceasefire and hostage-release deal, he said.</p>

<p>The United States, Qatar and Egypt tried for months to broker such a deal, which Netanyahu's domestic critics accused him of obstructing.</p>

<p>In Gaza, AFP journalists said the number of Israeli air strikes has dropped significantly in recent days.</p>

<p>A UN Satellite Centre assessment issued Monday said "two-thirds of the total structures in the Gaza Strip have sustained damage" in nearly a year of war.</p>

<p>Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,205 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures that include hostages killed in captivity.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory military offensive has killed at least 41,615 people in Gaza, most of them civilians, according to figures provided by the Hamas-run territory's health ministry. The UN has described the figures as reliable.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hezbollah said it "targeted" Israeli troops carrying out "movements" near the Lebanese border Tuesday, with a source close to the group saying the soldiers were "right on the border" as fears of an incursion grow.</p>

<p>The militant group said it targeted "enemy soldiers' movements in the orchards opposite Adaisseh and Kfarkila" near the border.</p>

<p>The US State Department had earlier said Israel was conducting limited operations targeting Hezbollah inside Lebanon.</p>

<p>A Lebanese security official reported "Israeli army movements on the southern Lebanese border".</p>

<p>Israeli troops are "launching artillery shells from areas that it declared as closed military zones" earlier on Monday," the official said, requesting anonymity to discuss sensitive matters.</p>

<p>Fears of an incursion also prompted Lebanon's army to move troops away from its southern border, a Lebanese military official told AFP Monday.</p>

<p>The Lebanese army is "repositioning and regrouping forces" from the southern border, the official said, requesting anonymity to discuss sensitive matters.</p>

<p>Lebanon's national army is dwarfed by the military power of the Iran-backed Hezbollah movement.</p>

<p>On Monday evening, Hezbollah's Al-Manar television channel reported "Zionist artillery shelling" near the border areas of Wazzani, the Khiam valley, Alma Al-Shaab and Naqura.</p>

<p>Wazzani and Khiam are right across from Metula in the north of Israel, where the military on Monday declared a closed military zone in Metula, Misgav Am, and Kfar Giladi.</p>

<p>Lebanon's state-run National News Agency reported "continued artillery shelling" on border areas including Wazzani and the nearby Marjayoun plain and Khiam.</p>

<p>Last Friday, the Israeli army killed Hezbollah's powerful leader Hassan Nasrallah in a strike on the group's southern Beirut bastion.</p>

<p>For the past week, Israel has launched an intense bombing campaign on the country's east, south and southern Beirut suburbs, killing hundreds of people and displacing up to one million, according to Lebanese officials.</p>

<p>The war follows nearly one year of cross-border exchanges of fire between Israel and Hezbollah that the Lebanese group said were in support of Palestinian ally Hamas, whose October 7 attack on Israel triggered war in Gaza.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a targeted airstrike on Saturday, the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) struck Beirut, resulting in the death of Eid Hassan Nashar, a high-ranking commander of Hezbollah's Medium-Range Rocket Unit.</p>

<p>Sharing a post on X, the IDF wrote, "Dismantled: Hezbollah's Missiles and Rockets Force. IAF fighter jets struck and eliminated commanders and infrastructure over the last week." It added, "During an airstrike in Beirut on Saturday, Eid Hassan Nashar, the Commander of Hezbollah's Medium-Range Rocket Unit, was eliminated."</p>

<p>According to the IDF, Eid Hassan Nashar held key leadership roles within Hezbollah. He served as the Commander of the Surface-to-Surface Rocket Unit, overseeing the organisation's day-to-day operations. The IDF stated, "Eid was a veteran commander in Hezbollah and played a significant role in the unit's day-to-day operations. In the past, he served as the Commander of the Surface-to-Surface Rocket Unit and Deputy Commander of the Badr Unit."</p>

<p>"Additionally, the commander, deputy commander and other commanders of Hezbollah's Precision Missile Unit were eliminated. Just last week, this unit was responsible for firing towards central Israel," the IDF added.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in a precision strike, the IDF dismantled a Hezbollah surface-to-air missile launcher storage facility, located approximately 1.5 kilometres from Beirut's international airport.</p>

<p>In a post on X, the IDF said, "A surface-to-air missile launcher storage facility that Hezbollah had positioned approximately 1.5 km from Beirut's international airport was dismantled in a precise IDF strike."</p>

<p>The IDF further asserted that the facility posed a threat to Lebanese and international airspace. "This infrastructure poses a threat to both Lebanese and international airspace. The IDF will continue to degrade Hezbollah's military capabilities in Lebanon," the IDF stated.</p>

<p>A day earlier, the IDF had announced the deaths of the head of the Lebanon branch of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), Nidal Abdel-Aal, and the head of the PFLP's military office in Lebanon, Imad Odeh, in an intelligence-based strike.</p>

<p>The IDF also reported that Hamas' Lebanon branch chief, Fateh Sherif, was killed in an airstrike. According to the IDF, Nidal Abdel-Aal took part in planning and executing terror attacks against Israel and directed terror activities in Judea and Samaria. He was responsible for the bus bombing attack in Beitar Illit and the shooting attack from a passing vehicle at the Huwara Junction in 2023.</p>

<p>In a post on X, the IDF stated, "Head of the Lebanon Branch of the PFLP terrorist organisation, Nidal Abdel-Aal, and Head of the PFLP's Military Office in Lebanon, Imad Odeh, were eliminated in a joint IDF and ISA intelligence-based strike. Abdel-Aal took part in planning and carrying out terror attacks against Israel and directed terror activities in Judea and Samaria, operating to establish terror infrastructure for attacks on Israeli civilians. Abdel-Aal directed the bus bombing attack in Beitar Illit on March 9, 2023, and the shooting attack from a passing vehicle at the Huwara Junction on March 25, 2023, during which two IDF soldiers were injured."</p>

<p>According to the IDF, Sherif was responsible for coordinating Hamas' terror activities in Lebanon with Hezbollah operatives, as well as Hamas' efforts in Lebanon to recruit operatives and acquire weapons.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel has told the United States it is conducting limited ground operations focused on Hezbollah infrastructure in Lebanon near the border with Israel, the State Department said on Monday.</p>

<p>"This is what they have informed us that they are currently conducting, which are limited operations targeting Hezbollah infrastructure near the border," State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller told reporters.</p>

<p>Asked to confirm they were limited ground operations, he said: "That is our understanding."</p>

<p>Indications grew on Monday that Israel was on the verge of sending ground troops into Lebanon, two weeks into an assault on the Iranian-backed Hezbollah militia that culminated in the assassination of its leader, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah.</p>

<p>A U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity told Reuters the positioning of Israeli troops suggested a ground incursion could be imminent.</p>

<p>After two weeks of intensive airstrikes and a string of assassinations of Hezbollah commanders, Israel has suggested ever more strongly that a land invasion is looming.</p>

<p>The Israeli attacks on militant targets in Lebanon are part of a conflict stretching from the Palestinian territories of Gaza and the occupied West Bank to Iranian-backed groups in Yemen and Iraq. The escalation has raised fears that the United States and Iran will be sucked into the conflict.</p>

<p>Miller said that the United States continues to support a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah but added that military pressure can at times enable diplomacy. He cautioned that military pressure can also lead to miscalculation and unintended consequences.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden called for a ceasefire in Lebanon on Monday but a US official said Israeli troop deployments suggested a ground incursion against Hezbollah militants could be imminent.</p>

<p>Asked about reports that Israeli ground troops were preparing to move into southern Lebanon, Biden told reporters that he was "comfortable with them (Israel) stopping."</p>

<p>Several top aides reinforced Biden's call for a ceasefire by urging a diplomatic resolution to the violence to allow tens of thousands of displaced Israelis and Lebanese to return to their homes along the border.</p>

<p>Washington "will continue to work with our partners in the region and around the world to advance a diplomatic resolution," Secretary of State Antony Blinken told a State Department conference.</p>

<p>But a U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that the positioning of Israeli troops as observed by the United States suggested a ground incursion into Lebanon could be imminent.</p>

<p>The official declined to comment further or to provide details on the posture of Israeli forces.</p>

<p>The US call for de-escalation follows two weeks of Israeli airstrikes and assassinations of Hezbollah commanders, including the Iran-backed group's leader, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, on Friday.</p>

<p>Israeli officials say they will do what is necessary to return some 70,000 citizens evacuated from northern Israeli communities after Hezbollah on Oct. 8 began rocket strikes in support of a Hamas assault on Israel from Gaza the previous day.</p>

<p>Speaking to troops deployed along Israel's northern border, Defence Minister Yoav Gallant hinted at a looming ground incursion.</p>

<p>"We will use all the means that may be required - your forces, other forces, from the air, from the sea, and on land. Good luck," Gallant said.</p>

<p>The Biden administration fears the killing of Nasrallah and further Israeli military action could ignite a wider regional conflict.</p>

<p>The U.S. envoy to the United Nations urged continued diplomacy to halt the violence in Lebanon and Gaza.</p>

<p>"We want to find a path to peace, so that Palestinians and Israelis have safety and Lebanese and Israelis living on the northern border find security and safety as well," U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Linda Thomas-Greenfield told reporters.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Labour Party candidate's landslide victory in the UK general elections sparked celebrations thousands of kilometres away in Uttar Pradesh's Kanpur and Gorakhpur.</p>

<p>Navendu Mishra, elected to the House of Commons for a second consecutive term from the Stockport constituency, was born in Kanpur in 1989. His mother's paternal home is in Gorakhpur.</p>

<p>Mr Mishra's maternal uncle Nilendar Pandey, a social worker and businessman who now lives in Lucknow, told PTI that some people in Gorakhpur, Lucknow and Kanpur celebrated his victory by distributing sweets and setting off crackers.</p>

<p>Mr Pandey said Mr Mishra left for the UK with his parents when he was four years old. His father was a marketing manager for Indian Petrochemicals Corporation Limited and moved to the UK after taking charge of a British company.</p>

<p>Mr Mishra grew up in the UK with his brother and a sister.</p>

<p>He entered politics after completing his studies in London and was elected to the House of Commons in the 2019 elections on a Labour Party ticket from Stockport.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">It's an honour to be officially nominated as the Labour candidate for Stockport constituency.<br />
<br />
Since 2019, I have always put the priorities of local residents first. If re-elected, I will continue to work hard for Brinnington, Edgeley, Davenport, the Heatons and Reddish. <a href="https://t.co/Ctv1CHn58F">pic.twitter.com/Ctv1CHn58F</a></p>
— Navendu Mishra (@NavPMishra) <a href="https://twitter.com/NavPMishra/status/1798363908820079061?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 5, 2024</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Mr Pandey said Mr Mishra entered politics through the trade union movement.</p>

<p>Mr Mishra is very close to him, Mr Pandey said and added that his nephew called him after winning the election to seek his blessings.</p>

<p>Mr Pandey said, "He (Mishra) likes coming to India. He is always keen on doing something for his country." "He visits India once every year or two and makes it a point to visit relatives from Gorakhpur to Delhi. He is a vegetarian and loves home-cooked food common in eastern Uttar Pradesh," he said.</p>

<p>Praising his nephew, Pandey said, "You can guess his popularity by his victory margin. In the UK, where elections are won by margins of only 1,000-2,000 votes, Mishra won by about 16,000 votes."</p>

<p>Mr Mishra secured 21,787 of the votes cast. His closest contender, Reform UK candidate Lynn Schofield, got 6,517 votes.</p>

<p>Mr Pandey said Mr Mishra returned to India for the first time after about seven years in the UK and spent time at the home of his maternal grandparents in Gorakhpur.</p>

<p>"Mishra used to fly kites and play cricket in the streets with the children of locals, including my two sons and daughter. My children are also ecstatic over his victory," he added.</p>

<p>During a recent visit to India, Mr Mishra led a delegation to meet Gujarat Chief Minister Bhupendra Patel. The delegation also met External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar in Delhi.</p>

<p>Following this, he spent time with his family in Delhi and Lucknow, Mr Pandey said.</p>

<p>Political experts claimed that Mr Mishra's victory and his connection with India would strengthen bilateral relations and cultural, political and social ties between the two nations.</p>

<p>Mr Pandey said Mr Mishra had also planned to visit the Ram temple in Ayodhya but that programme did not materialise.</p>

<p>Ishwar Singh, an associate of Mr Pandey in Gorakhpur, told PTI, "Mishra was inspired to join politics and social service by his maternal uncle Nilendar Pandey."</p>

<p>"When he visited Gorakhpur at a young age, he used to see the crowds gathering to meet Pandey and got inspired," he added.</p>

<p>Mr Mishra's paternal home in Kanpur's Arya Nagar was also teeming with locals, gathered to congratulated the family on his second successive election victory.</p>

<p>Mr Mishra last visited his family home in Arya Nagar about two years ago.</p>

<p>On Friday, Keir Starmer became the UK's new prime minister after his Labour Party secured a landslide victory in a general election in which weary voters inflicted a "sobering verdict" on Rishi Sunak-led Conservatives.</p>

<p>The Labour Party secured 412 seats in the 650-member House of Commons. Mr Sunak's Conservatives won just 121 seats.</p>

<p>Discussing plans to invite his nephew to India, Mr Pandey said, "We have invited Mishra to come here soon and a welcome ceremony will be organised in Lucknow after his arrival."&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hamas has accepted a US proposal to begin talks on releasing Israeli hostages, including soldiers and men, 16 days after the first phase of an agreement aimed at ending the Gaza war, a senior Hamas source told Reuters on Saturday.</p>

<p>The Hamas group has dropped a demand that Israel first commit to a permanent ceasefire before signing the agreement, and would allow negotiations to achieve that throughout the six-week first phase, the source told Reuters on condition of anonymity because the talks are private.</p>

<p>A Palestinian official close to the internationally mediated peace efforts had said the proposal could lead to a framework agreement if embraced by Israel and would end the nine-month-old war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.</p>

<p>A source in Israel's negotiating team, speaking on condition of anonymity, said on Friday there was now a real chance of achieving agreement. That was in sharp contrast to past instances in the nine-month-old war in Gaza, when Israel said conditions attached by Hamas were unacceptable.</p>

<p>A spokesperson for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Saturday, the Jewish Sabbath. On Friday his office said talks would continue next week and emphasised that gaps between the sides still remained.</p>

<p>The conflict has claimed the lives of more than 38,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza health officials, since Hamas attacked southern Israeli cities on Oct. 7, killing 1,200 people and taking some 250 hostages, according to official Israeli figures.</p>

<p>The new proposal ensures that mediators would guarantee a temporary ceasefire, aid delivery and the withdrawal of Israeli troops as long as indirect talks continue to implement the second phase of the agreement, the Hamas source said.</p>

<p>Efforts to secure a ceasefire and hostage release in Gaza have intensified over the past few days with active shuttle diplomacy among Washington, Israel and Qatar, which is leading mediation efforts from Doha, where the exiled Hamas leadership is based.</p>

<p>A regional source said the US administration was trying hard to secure a deal before the presidential election in November.</p>

<p>Netanyahu said on Friday that the head of Israel's Mossad intelligence agency had returned from an initial meeting with mediators in Qatar and that negotiations would continue next week.</p>

<p>Some families of hostages on Saturday gave a statement to reporters ahead of a weekly hostage rally in Tel Aviv, in which they called on Netanyahu to go through with the deal.</p>

<p>"For the first time in many months, we feel hope," said Einav Zangauker, the mother of Matan Zangauker, 24, who was abducted from his kibbutz home on Oct. 7. "This is an opportunity that cannot be missed," she said.</p>

<p><strong>Fighting Rages</strong></p>

<p>Meanwhile, Israeli forces stepped up military strikes across the enclave, killing at least 29 Palestinians in the past 24 hours, and wounding 100 others, the territory's health officials said.</p>

<p>Among those killed in separate air strikes were five local journalists, raising the death count of journalists since Oct 7 to 158, according to the Hamas-led Gaza government media office.</p>

<p>Israeli forces, which have deepened their incursions into Rafah, near the border with Egypt, killed four Palestinian policemen and wounded eight others, in an air strike on their vehicle on Saturday, health officials said.</p>

<p>A statement issued by the Hamas-run interior ministry said the four included Fares Abdel-Al, the head of the police force in western Rafah neighbourhood of Tel Al-Sultan.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said forces continued "intelligence-base operations" in Rafah, destroyed several underground structures, seized weapons and equipment, and killed several Palestinian gunmen.</p>

<p>Israel said its operations in Rafah aimed to eradicate the last Hamas armed wing battalions.</p>

<p>In the central Al-Nuseirat camp, one of the enclave's eight historic refugee camps, an Israeli air strike on a house killed 10 Palestinians, medics said.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said it eliminated a Hamas rocket cell that operated from inside a humanitarian-designated area. It said it carried out a precise strike after taking measures to ensure civilians were unharmed. Hamas denies Israeli accusations it uses civilian properties for military purposes.</p>

<p>The armed wings of Hamas and the Islamic Jihad said fighters attacked Israeli forces in several areas of the enclave by anti-tank rockets and mortar bombs.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Britain's Conservative Party, thrashed by Labour at the general election, on Saturday faced the task of rebuilding as leading right wingers warned it could face extinction unless it starts listening to its core voters.</p>

<p>A record number of ex-prime minister Rishi Sunak's top team and other prominent Tories lost their seats in Thursday's electoral drubbing.</p>

<p>The anti-immigration Reform UK party led by Brexit firebrand Nigel Farage maximised the damage by splitting the right-wing vote and picking up former Tory supporters in key constituencies.</p>

<p>Even before campaigning had ended, one ex-minister had launched an excoriating attack on the party for not grasping that "our failure to unite the right would destroy us".</p>

<p>Former interior minister Suella Braverman, seen as a leadership contender, correctly predicted the Tories would haemorrhage votes to Reform.</p>

<p>"Why? Because we failed to cut immigration or tax or deal with the net-zero and woke policies we have presided over for 14 years," she wrote in the Daily Telegraph.</p>

<p>Conceding inevitable defeat, she called for a "searingly honest post-match analysis", adding that it would "decide whether our party continues to exist at all".</p>

<p>Major British political parties have seen dramatic downturns in their fortunes before.</p>

<p>In the years after World War I, a divided Liberal Party found itself supplanted by the Labour Party as the main opposition.</p>

<p>The party of 19th century political giant William Gladstone and World War I leader David Lloyd George never again regained its earlier status as a party of government.</p>

<p><strong>'New movement'</strong></p>

<p>Other senior party voices to deliver an early diagnosis of the Conservatives' current predicament included David Frost, chief Brexit negotiator under ex-PM Boris Johnson.</p>

<p>David Frost resigned from government in December 2021, citing Johnson's tax hikes and net zero commitments among other complaints.</p>

<p>To revive traditional Conservative values and electability "after the cataclysm", he called for the creation of a "new movement for "reformed conservatism".</p>

<p>Sunak has said he will stay on as party leader until arrangements are put in place to choose a successor amid fears the party will now descend into bitter infighting.</p>

<p>Potential leadership candidates who managed to hang on to their seats include former home secretaries Braverman and Priti Patel. Former finance minister Jeremy Hunt became the first to rule himself out on Saturday telling GB News that "the time had passed".</p>

<p>"There's going to be a very immediate issue around how to relate to Nigel Farage," Michael Kenny, director of the Bennett Institue for Public Policy at the University of Cambridge, told AFP.</p>

<p>He said there would be a push to find a leadership candidate who could unite the party but "not provide an opening to Farage".</p>

<p>Others may look for someone potentially "more open to the idea of fusing with Reform".</p>

<p>Kenny said what had been unusual about this election was the way the "battle for the soul of the party" had been started before a single vote was cast.</p>

<p>With the Conservatives scoring a record low of just 121 seats, handing Starmer's government a majority in parliament of more than 170, some have predicted Labour could be in power for a generation.</p>

<p><strong>'Civil war'</strong></p>

<p>However, Philip Cowley, professor of politics at Queen Mary University of London, cautioned against too much pessimism.</p>

<p>He said people had been "writing off" one or more of the main parties ever since the early 1960s, when it was claimed demographics meant Labour could never win again "only for them to do so in 1964", he told AFP.</p>

<p>In 1992, after the Conservatives won their fourth consecutive victory, there was again "lots of talk about how Britain was now a one-party state, only for Labour to go on to win their greatest ever landslide five years later", Cowley added.</p>

<p>More recently, he noted, commentators suggested the Conservatives could never win again during the tenures of former Labour leaders Tony Blair and Gordon Brown.</p>

<p>"And yet they did," in 2010 with David Cameron.</p>

<p>London School of Economics political expert Tony Travers said the Conservative Party was the "world's most durable political party" in many ways but that the result was still a "disaster".</p>

<p>While "not a massive amount of difference" stood between Labour and the Conservatives on many policies, Labour had managed to look more centrist and moderate to the electorate, he added.</p>

<p>And divisions that had beset the party could prove a major obstacle to reinventing itself, Travers said.</p>

<p>"They were split after Brexit... there's a civil war going on all the time, which is going to make their life difficult in the coming parliament."</p>

<p>Offering his own analysis in the Daily Mail on Saturday, Tory ex-prime minister Boris Johnson highlighted that Labour's landslide majority was built on fewer votes than it secured in 2019 when the Conservatives under Johnson won an 80-seat majority.</p>

<p>"We are capable of endless regeneration," he said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The death count from floods in Bangladesh this week has risen to eight, leaving more than two million affected after heavy rains caused major rivers to burst their banks, officials confirmed Saturday.</p>

<p>The South Asian nation of 170 million people, crisscrossed by hundreds of rivers, has seen more frequent floods in recent decades.</p>

<p>Climate change has made rainfall more erratic and melting glaciers upstream in the Himalayan mountains.</p>

<p>Two teenage boys were killed when a boat capsized in flood waters in Shahjadur, the northern rural town's police chief Sabuj Rana told AFP.</p>

<p>"There were nine people in the small boat. Seven swam to safety. Two boys did not know how to swim. They drowned," he said.</p>

<p>Bishwadeb Roy, a police chief in Kurigram, told AFP that three others had been killed in two separate electrocution incidents after their boats became entangled with live electricity wires in flood water.</p>

<p>Another three died in separate flood-related incidents around the country, officials told AFP earlier this week.</p>

<p>The government said it has opened hundreds of shelters for people displaced by the waters and sent food and relief to hard-hit districts in the country's north region.</p>

<p>"More than two million people have been affected by the floods. Seventeen of the country's 64 districts have been affected," Kamrul Hasan, the secretary of the country's disaster management ministry, told AFP.</p>

<p>Hasan said the flood situation may worsen in the north over the coming days with the Brahmaputra, one of Bangladesh's main waterways, flowing above danger levels in some areas.</p>

<p>In the worst-hit Kurigram district, eight out of nine rural towns have been marooned by flood water, local disaster and relief official Abdul Hye told AFP.</p>

<p>"We live with floods here. But this year the water was very high. In three days, Brahmaputra rose by six to eight feet (2-2.5 metres)," Abdul Gafur, a local councillor in the district, told AFP.</p>

<p>"Flood water has inundated more than 80 percent of homes in my area. We are trying to deliver food, especially rice and edible oil. But there is a drinking water crisis."</p>

<p>Bangladesh is in the middle of the annual summer monsoon, which brings South Asia 70-80 percent of its annual rainfall, as well as regular deaths and destruction due to flooding and landslides.</p>

<p>The rainfall is hard to forecast and varies considerably, but scientists say climate change is making the monsoon stronger and more erratic.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Describing it as "a project for posterity," India on Saturday donated digital equipment, including 2,000 Tabs, worth Rs 300 million for use to 200 schools in the southern province of Sri Lanka.</p>

<p>A ceremony in the southern district of Galle, attended by President Ranil Wickremesinghe and Indian High Commissioner Santosh Jha, marked a significant step towards educational modernisation, with the provision of 200 Smart Classrooms and 2,000 Tabs to 200 schools in the Southern Province.</p>

<p>"Following a request by the Minister of Health and Industry, Dr Ramesh Pathirana, the Government of India allocated Rs 300 million to the Southern Provincial Council for this project. Of the 200 selected schools, 150 are in the Galle district, while the remaining 50 are in the Hambantota and Matara districts," a statement from the President's Media Division (PMD) said.</p>

<p>Additionally, 2,000 Tabs were distributed, with each of the 200 classrooms receiving 10 Tabs, the statement said.</p>

<p>"We deeply appreciate the support extended by neighbouring India in advancing modern technology. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has expressed interest in establishing an Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) campus in Sri Lanka, which is highly appreciated," Mr Wickremesinghe said.</p>

<p>"Additionally, negotiations to enhance cooperation in the energy sector with India are progressing successfully," he said.</p>

<p>Pathirana and Minister of Education Dr Susil Premajayantha, both appreciated India's assistance in their respective speeches.</p>

<p>Mr Premajayantha also said, "Today, 200 schools in the Southern Province have been equipped with comfortable classrooms and 2,000 Tabs. Moving forward, the schools will undergo digitisation, with 1,250 schools already being connected."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mr Jha reciprocated by saying: "As India's neighbour, we consistently extend support to Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka holds a crucial position in our foreign policy. India remains steadfast in its commitment to providing essential infrastructure and technical knowledge support to Sri Lanka."&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Labour leader on Friday won a landslide election victory bringing to a close 14 years of Conservative rule.</p>

<p>He said he was "restless for change" and that his party had received a "mandate to do politics differently".</p>

<p>Keir Starmer started the day with a first meeting of his cabinet including Britain's first woman finance minister Rachel Reeves and new foreign minister David Lammy.</p>

<p>"We have a huge amount of work to do, so now we get on with our work," he told his top team to applause and smiles around the cabinet table.</p>

<p>At a news conference afterwards he said he would not be proceeding with former Conservative prime minister Rishi Sunak's controversial scheme to tackle rising small boat arrivals on England's southern coast by deporting migrants to Rwanda.</p>

<p>"The Rwanda scheme was dead and buried before it started... I'm not prepared to continue with gimmicks that don't act as a deterrent," he told reporters at his 10 Downing Street office.</p>

<p><strong>'Driving growth'</strong></p>

<p>Keir Starmer spent his first hours in Downing Street on Friday appointing his ministerial team, hours after securing his centre-left party's return to power with a whopping 174-seat majority in the UK parliament.</p>

<p>Notable lower-ranking appointments included Patrick Vallance, chief scientific government adviser during the Covid-19 pandemic, who has been made a science minister.</p>

<p>James Timpson, whose shoe repair company employs ex-offenders, was also made a prisons minister.</p>

<p>Keir Starmer said both new ministers were people "associated with change" and illustrated his determination to deliver concrete improvements to people's lives.</p>

<p>Work on "driving growth" had already begun, he said, adding that he had told his ministers "exactly what I expect of them in terms of standards, delivery, and the trust that the country has put in them".</p>

<p><strong>NATO support 'unshakable'</strong></p>

<p>Flag-waving crowds of cheering Labour activists on Friday welcomed Keir Starmer to Downing Street hours after his victory.</p>

<p>But daunting challenges await his government, including a stagnating economy, creaking public services and households suffering from a years-long cost-of-living crisis.</p>

<p>World leaders lined up to congratulate the new British premier.</p>

<p>Keir Starmer spoke by telephone with US President Joe Biden and "discussed their shared commitment to the special relationship between the UK and US and their aligned ambitions for greater economic growth", according to London.</p>

<p>He also spoke to President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky, and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.</p>

<p>However, former -- and potentially future -- US president Donald Trump ignored Keir Starmer, instead hailing the five-seat electoral breakthrough of his ally Nigel Farage's far-right Reform UK party.</p>

<p>Keir Starmer will make his debut on the international stage as leader when he flies to Washington next week for a NATO summit.</p>

<p>"It is for me to be absolutely clear that the first duty of my government is security and defence, to make clear our unshakable support of Nato," he said.</p>

<p>He added that he had reiterated the support of the UK and its allies for Ukraine to Zelensky.</p>

<p><strong>Infighting fears</strong></p>

<p>The election saw Labour near its record of 418 seats under ex-leader Tony Blair in 1997 by winning 412.</p>

<p>The Conservatives suffered their worst-ever defeat, capturing just 121 constituencies, prompting Rishi Sunak to apologise to the nation and confirm that he will resign as Tory leader once arrangements are in place to select a successor.</p>

<p>A record 12 senior ex-government ministers lost their seats, alongside former prime minister Liz Truss, whose economically calamitous short-lived tenure in 2022 wounded the party irreparably ahead of the election.</p>

<p>It is now poised for another period of infighting between a moderate wing eager for a centrist leader and those who may even be willing to court Farage as a new figurehead.</p>

<p>The election also saw the centrist Liberal Democrats make their biggest gains in around a century, claiming more than 70 seats.</p>

<p>But it was a dismal contest for the pro-independence Scottish National Party, which was virtually obliterated in Scotland. It dropped from 48 seats to just nine.</p>

<p>The Green Party had its best general election, quadrupling its MPs count to four.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, an unprecedented six independent lawmakers were elected -- four of them defeating Labour candidates in districts with large Muslim populations and campaigns centred around the Israel-Hamas conflict.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Indian-origin former Conservative Party member of Parliament Alok Sharma, who had chosen not to seek re-election in this weeks general election, will now take his seat in the House of Lords.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Indian-origin former Conservative Party member of Parliament Alok Sharma, who had chosen not to seek re-election in this week's general election, will now take his seat in the House of Lords after being conferred a peerage by King Charles III.</p>

<p>The 56-year-old Agra-born MP, who was knighted as Sir Alok in the King's New Year's Honours list last year for his contribution to tackling climate change through his leadership as president of the COP26 climate summit over two years ago, now becomes Lord Sharma.</p>

<p>Sharma was among seven nominations made by outgoing prime minister Rishi Sunak for his customary “Dissolution Peerages,” which also saw former Prime Minister Theresa May become a peer in the Upper House of the UK Parliament.</p>

<p>“Humbled to have been appointed to the House of Lords but so sorry to see many fine Conservative candidates lose, including in Reading West &amp; Mid Berkshire,” said Sharma in a post on X on Friday, as his party's disastrous general election results became evident.</p>

<p>His former constituency was won by Labour's Olivia Bailey, who Sharma described as a “decent person who I feel will serve the area diligently.” Sharma's Reading West constituency, like several others across the UK, had undergone a boundary change to become Reading West &amp; Mid Berkshire.</p>

<p>“This has not been an easy decision for me. It has been the honour of my life to serve as the MP for a constituency in the town where I grew up and a privilege to serve in government and represent the UK on the international stage,” Sharma said, when he announced his decision in September last year to not contest the next general election.</p>

<p>“I will continue to support my Conservative colleagues and serve my constituents diligently for the remainder of my time as an MP, as well as champion in Parliament the causes I care deeply about, especially climate action,” he added.</p>

<p>Sharma was selected as a parliamentary candidate in 2006 and has served as a Tory MP since 2010. In his role as Cabinet minister since then, he has been appointed Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy and International Development until he was conferred a Cabinet-level role as COP26 president by former PM Boris Johnson in January 2021.</p>

<p>Under Rishi Sunak as prime minister, he was on the House of Commons back benches and often spoke out to express his concerns about the government's delay in certain targets towards meeting the country's climate action Net Zero pledge by 2050.</p>

<p>“Chopping and changing policies creates uncertainty for businesses and the public. Ultimately this makes it more difficult to attract investment and pushes up costs for consumers,” he said.</p>

<p>Sharma was among a series of high-profile Tory colleagues, including former defence secretary Ben Wallace, who had decided not to seek re-election in the 2024 polls.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>India-Iran partnership in various sectors, including connectivity, has expanded tremendously in recent times, especially during the tenure of Iran's late President Seyyed Ebrahim Raisi who passed away in a helicopter crash in May this year.</p>

<p>India had also observed a day's state mourning as a mark of respect to the late Iranian President and other eight people, including the country's Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, who lost their lives in the tragic accident.</p>

<p>It was also under India's presidency that Iran joined the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO).</p>

<p>Both countries have fast-tracked infrastructure cooperation, focusing especially on the Chabahar project and the International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC) - the 7,200 km-long multimodal trade corridor linking Russia with India via the ports of Iran.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As a mark of reverence on the 89th birthday of His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama, an icon of ahimsa (non-violence) and karuna (compassion), on Saturday, 'Never Forget Tibet: The Dalai Lama's Untold Story' was released worldwide.</p>

<p>The documentary, directed by Jean-Paul Mertinez, explores details of the Nobel Peace Laureate's incredible escape into exile for the first time on film in his own words, with the Indian political officer who led him to safety -- late Havildar Mander Singh.</p>

<p>Featuring the Tibetan community in exile and those with historic ties to Tibet, the film explores the Dalai Lama's compassion for a world seemingly in crisis today and seeks to find out what can be learnt from his inspirational life story, Tibetan culture and its ancient spirituality.</p>

<p>Inspired by the book 'An Officer and His Holiness' by Rani Singh, the film is narrated by British acting legend Hugh Bonneville (Downton Abbey, Paddington) and features music from Grammy-nominated artist Anoushka Shankar.</p>

<p>The film is produced by Compassionate Films and the Executive Producers are Templeheart Films, Lyndon Baldock, Gavin Patterson and Rani Singh.</p>

<p>The worldwide digital release has been made possible with the collaboration of The Italian Buddhist Union, Rome, Italy.</p>

<p>The feature-length documentary will be available on world's leading streaming platforms, including Apple TV , Amazon and Google Play.</p>

<p>In 1959, the occupying Chinese troops suppressed the Tibetan national uprising in Lhasa and forced the 14th Dalai Lama and over 80,000 Tibetans into exile in India and neighbouring countries.</p>

<p>On reaching India after a three-week-long and treacherous journey, the Dalai Lama first took up residence for about a year in Mussoorie in Uttarakhand.</p>

<p>On March 10, 1960, just before moving to Dharamsala, which also serves as the headquarters of the exiled Tibetan establishment, the Dalai Lama said: "For those of us in exile, I said that our priority must be resettlement and the continuity of our cultural traditions. We, Tibetans, would eventually prevail in regaining freedom for Tibet."</p>

<p>Currently, the government-in-exile is based in Dharamsala, a town in Himalayan foothills where a community of Tibetans lives in exile with the Dalai Lama, hoping to sustain their struggle to secure complete autonomy in their Chinese-ruled homeland, Tibet.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Britain's newly-elected Prime Minister Keir Starmer spoke to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday morning and said he stood ready to conclude a Free Trade Agreement that worked for both sides, Downing Street said.</p>

<p>India and the UK have been negotiating a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) for over two years with a Conservative Party-led government but the talks were stalled in the 14th round amidst the general election cycles in both countries.</p>

<p>It is now expected to be picked up by the new Starmer-led Labour government, which was voted in with a landslide this week.</p>

<p>According to the Downing Street readout of the newly-elected UK Prime Minister's Indo-Pacific-related international calls on Saturday, the call with Modi seems to have been the first followed by Japan and Australia.</p>

<p>"The leaders exchanged congratulations on their respective election wins, and reflected on the strength of the relationship between the UK and India," a Downing Street spokesperson said.</p>

<p>"Discussing the Free Trade Agreement, the Prime Minister said he stood ready to conclude a deal that worked for both sides. The leaders hoped to meet at the earliest opportunity," the spokesperson added.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Pleased to speak with <a href="https://twitter.com/Keir_Starmer?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Keir_Starmer</a>. Congratulated him on being elected as the Prime Minister of the UK.

<p>Both sides have been working towards clinching a pact to enhance the GBP 38.1 billion bilateral trading partnership since January 2022, when Boris Johnson was the British prime minister.</p>

<p>The talks have since had to contend with political turmoil in the UK that first led to a short-lived Liz Truss premiership followed by Rishi Sunak as Britain's first prime minister of Indian heritage.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The world organisation has warned of a “heightened risk of a full-scale war” along the Lebanon-Israel border where 901 Indian peacekeepers are deployed.</p>

<p>“The UN is deeply concerned at the increase in the intensity of exchanges of fire across the Blue Line yesterday, which heightens the risk of a full-scale war”, Secretary-General Antonio Guterres's spokesperson's office said on Friday.</p>

<p>“Escalation can and must be avoided. We reiterate that the danger of miscalculation leading to a sudden and wider conflagration is real,” it added.</p>

<p>After an Israeli drone killed a senior commander of the Hezbollah in Southern Lebanon on Wednesday, the militia responded by sending a barrage of 100 rockets into Israel.</p>

<p>The well-entrenched Hezbollah, which has the backing of Iran has threatened to continue attacks on Israel in solidarity with Hamas under Israeli assault in Gaza.</p>

<p>The decades-long tensions in the area have intensified since October 7 when Hamas attacked Israel, which launched a retribution on Gaza that it controls.</p>

<p>In solidarity with Hamas, Hezbollah said attacks on Israel till there is a ceasefire in Gaza, raising fears of a wider regional conflict.</p>

<p>Civilians have suffered the most from the volley of attacks between Hezbollah and Israel.</p>

<p>About 60,000 Lebanese have reportedly been displaced, and, according to United States Secretary of State Antony Blinken, about 20,000 Israelis have also been forced to flee the border areas because of the attacks.</p>

<p>“Israel has effectively lost its sovereignty in the northern quadrant of its country because people don't safe to go to their homes,” he said on Monday underscoring the risk of war.</p>

<p>He added that an agreement reached through diplomacy was needed to end the security risks and ensure that “forces are pulled back.”</p>

<p>The spokesperson's office also emphasised that a “political and diplomatic solution is the only viable way forward.”</p>

<p>The Indian peacekeepers are a part of the 10,000-strong 49-nation UN Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) charged by the Security Council to work with Lebanese national forces to keep order in the volatile section known as the Blue Line that separates Lebanon and Israel.</p>

<p>In effect, the mission also acts as a buffer between the two countries at times caught in the crossfire between Israel and Hezbollah.</p>

<p>The spokesperson's office said that the Foreign Affairs Committee of Lebanon's Parliament visited UNIFIL to express support for the mission and its mandate on Thursday.</p>

<p>Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert, the UN special coordinator for Lebanon met with Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri and caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati to emphasise “the need for de-escalation across the Blue Line,” it added.</p>

<p>Lebanon's writ is weak in the region where Hezbollah controls vast tracts of territory.</p>

<p>Mohammad Naameh Nasser, who Israel blamed for rockets into the country, was the second Hezbollah commander killed in less than a month.</p>

<p>Last month another Hezbollah commander, Taleb Abdallah, was killed by Israel in Southern Lebanon.</p>

<p>Hezbollah retaliated with about 150 rockets and drones, but international diplomacy kept it from further escalation.</p>

<p>At another peacekeeping mission in the region, the UN Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) charged with maintaining the ceasefire between Israel and Syria, 202 Indian troops are deployed.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Dalai Lama said on Saturday he is recovering from a knee surgery and feels "physically fit", brushing aside rumours of ill health on his 89th birthday.</p>

<p>"Recently I had surgery on my knee, which has given me some problem. However, I am recovering and have no problem at all now," the exiled spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhism said in a video message from the United States, where he is recuperating.</p>

<p>"There may be people trying to confuse you about my health, saying that the Dalai Lama has gone to a hospital and is undergoing treatments, and so on, making my condition sound grave. You don't need to trust such misinformation," he said.</p>

<p>A charismatic figure who popularised Buddhism internationally, the Dalai Lama won a Nobel Peace Prize in 1989 for keeping alive the Tibetan cause in exile. He fled to India in 1959, nine years after China sent troops into the Himalayan region in 1950, saying it was liberating Tibetan "serfs".</p>

<p>As the spiritual leader ages and battles health problems, the appointment of his successor has become a looming issue for Tibetans struggling for more autonomy in China or outright independence. Tibetan Buddhists believe that learned monastics are reincarnated after death as newborns.</p>

<p>The Dalai Lama has said he will clarify questions about succession - including whether and where he would be reincarnated - around his 90th birthday.</p>

<p>"I am nearly 90 now but I don't feel unhealthy, except for the slight discomfort in my legs. I would like to thank all my fellow Tibetans in and outside Tibet for your prayers on my birthday," he said, adding that some issues are part of ageing.</p>

<p>On Saturday, tens of thousands of Buddhists and well-wishers around the world are to gather to celebrate and pray for the long life of a leader who for them represents the strongest hope of an eventual return to Tibet.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Joe Biden fended off questions about his mental fitness and electability on Friday in a TV interview meant to draw a line under a disastrous debate performance that triggered calls for him to quit his re-election bid.</p>

<p>With rebellion brewing among some nervous Democratic voters, lawmakers and donors, the one-to-one with the ABC network was hyped as the most consequential of the 81-year-old president's long career.</p>

<p>But the 22-minute sit-down appeared to provide little reassurance, as Biden blamed sickness for his sub-par performance and repeatedly dismissed polling and fears within his party that the debate had gravely wounded his prospects.</p>

<p>"I was sick, I was feeling terrible... I just had a really bad cold," said the president, in his first unscripted remarks of any length since last week's showdown with Republican rival Donald Trump.</p>

<p>The interview was intended to help Biden weather the storm, but his hoarse voice and meandering answers drew immediate Democratic fire for appearing "out of touch."</p>

<p>Asked if staying in the race might jeopardize Democrats holding on to the White House, Biden said: "I don't think anybody's more qualified to be president or win this race than me."</p>

<p>He dodged calls to have doctors assess his mental acuity, saying that the duties of the presidency mean "I have a cognitive test every single day. Every day I have that test, everything I do."</p>

<p>The Trump campaign mockingly posted on social media that "Biden sounds great" as the broadcast went out, before concluding the president "is in denial and in decline."</p>

<p>The interview came after Biden was hesitant and often incoherent during the debate against Trump in Atlanta, leading to panic within his party and calls for him to pull out of the race.</p>

<p>- 'I'll beat Trump' -</p>

<p>The Biden campaign has pushed back hard on any suggestion he may withdraw and, just hours before the ABC interview, released an aggressive campaign travel schedule for the rest of July.</p>

<p>Appearing at a campaign rally in Madison, Wisconsin, the president delivered an energetic stump speech, unequivocally declaring, "I'm staying in the race. I'll beat Donald Trump."</p>

<p>Post-debate polls have shown a widening deficit in Trump's favor, and at least four Democrats in Congress have called on Biden to step aside, as have major newspapers, donors and a raft of Democratic-supporting political commentators.</p>

<p>Senate Intelligence Committee chairman Mark Warner and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries were both planning crisis talks with lawmakers in the coming days, US media reported.</p>

<p>In Friday's interview, ABC host George Stephanopoulos repeatedly referenced the growing Democratic clamor for a conversation on picking a new candidate, asking Biden if he would step down if convinced he couldn't beat Trump.</p>

<p>"Well, it depends. If the Lord Almighty comes down and tells me that, I might do that," he said.</p>

<p>Biden added that he had not watched the debate afterward, saying "I don't think I did, no."</p>

<p>And he dismissed the idea that his poor performance was a sign of a more serious health problem.</p>

<p>"It was a bad episode, no indication of any serious condition. I was exhausted. I didn't listen to my instincts in terms of preparing and -- and I had a bad night," Biden said.</p>

<p>David Axelrod, a top aide in Barack Obama's White House and an occasional thorn in the side of the Biden administration, said the interview showed a president "dangerously out of touch" with concerns over his fitness for office.</p>

<p>"Four years ago at this time, he was 10 points ahead of Trump (in polls). Today, he is six points behind," Axelrod posted on X.</p>

<p>The White House has announced Biden will visit Pennsylvania this weekend before holding a press conference during the NATO summit in Washington next week.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif will decide the fate of social media platforms such as YouTube, WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram and TikTok during the Muharram festival as Pak's Punjab government sought a ban on them, citing need to control "hate material.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif would decide the fate of social media platforms such as YouTube, WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram and TikTok during the Muharram festival as the Punjab government sought a ban on them, citing the need to control "hate material".</p>

<p>Shia Muslims hold large gatherings during the festival to observe the martyrdom of the grandson of the prophet of Islam.</p>

<p>The Muslims generally observe his martyrdom as a symbol of resistance to tyranny, and the Shia Muslims take out rallies during the first ten days of Muharram which culminate into huge processions on the 9th and 10th of the month.</p>

<p>The Sunni Muslims have a historic theological rivalry with the Shias, and Pakistan's extremist Sunni groups brand them as heretics and target them through bombings, with Pakistan witnessing numerous such attacks in the past.</p>

<p>To disrupt communication among the militants, governments in Pakistan traditionally undertake elaborate security measures during Muharram, including suspension of internet, cell phone and social media services to avoid acts of terrorism.</p>

<p>The Punjab government had asked the federal government to suspend access to social media from July 6 to 11 to control the spread of misinformation and hate material to prevent sectarian violence.</p>

<p>This week, the provincial home department, through a letter to the Interior Ministry, recommended suspending "Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, YouTube, X, TikTok, etc. across the province".</p>

<p>The Ministry of Interior after a meeting held on Friday deferred a decision on the Punjab government's request, according to an overnight statement.</p>

<p>It stated that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif would make the final decision on the matter, adding that the requests of the provinces had "neither been rejected nor accepted".</p>

<p>The statement did not reveal which provinces other than Punjab had made such requests but indicated that Punjab was not the only one to have sought this.</p>

<p>Muharram is expected to begin on Sunday or Monday on the condition of the sighting of the moon.</p>

<p>Separately, a body of clerics tasked to sight the moon is meeting this evening to decide the beginning of Muharram.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[Gelsenkirchen, a city in western Germany, is temporarily renaming itself "Swiftkirchen" in honour of Taylor Swift's upcoming Eras Tour shows.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Gelsenkirchen, a city in western Germany, is temporarily renaming itself "Swiftkirchen" in honour of Taylor Swift's upcoming Eras Tour shows. The city's mayor, Karin Welge, approved the proposal ahead of the popstar's performances from July 17-19.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">Taylor Swift is set to perform at three concerts in Gelsenkirchen, and thousands of her fans, known as 'Swifties,' are expected to attend. The city is preparing for the events by putting up signs with the new name, which translates to “Swift's Church.”&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">The decision to temporarily change the city's name was taken after Aleshanee Westhoff from Emmerich, a fan of Taylor, started a petition and even wrote to Mayor Welge about this.</p>

<p dir="ltr">"It's a great idea to temporarily rename Gelsenkirchen to 'Swiftkirchen', which is why I'm particularly pleased that you can experience the short-term 'renaming' of Gelsenkirchen live and up close in Gelsenkirchen today," Mr Welge said in a letter to Westhoff, according to an official release.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Also, the first signage that marks the entrance to "Swiftkirchen" has also been installed by Westhoff on Ebertstrasse, the release stated.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Markus Schwardtmann, the head of the city's public relations department, said, "Today is the starting signal. We will be installing many more signs in highly frequented places in Gelsenkirchen in the coming days".</p>

<p dir="ltr">Besides, a "Taylor Swift tram" from Bogestra is already said to be on the road and will be making an attractive selfie motif, the release said, while highlighting the red frames that have been set up all over the city.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Taylor Swift will also receive her own stone on the Gelsenkirchen Walk of Fame, alongside local notables like soccer coach Rudi Assauer and writer Ilse Kibgis.</p>

<p dir="ltr">"There will be many small and large surprises so that the Swifties in Gelsenkirchen have a lot to discover," Mr Schwardtmann said.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Not just that, the German city will even be hosting a "big open-air Taylor Swift party,” which has been named “Taylor Town”. It will feature “lots of offers (swap market, karaoke, tattoos) related to the star."</p>

<p dir="ltr">"As mayor, I am of course very happy that Taylor Swift, currently the most successful singer in the world, will be performing three times in Gelsenkirchen. International attention will therefore be back on our city immediately after EURO 2024," Mayor Welge said in the official statement.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Taylor Swift is used to such adulation. At the beginning of the Eras Tour in March last year, Arizona's Glendale was temporarily renamed as “Swift City” in honour of the singer's tour stop in the city.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) said on Saturday that China's largest coastguard vessel has anchored in Manila's exclusive economic zone (EEZ) in the South China Sea, and is meant to intimidate its smaller Asian neighbour.</p>

<p>The China coastguard's 165-meter 'monster ship' entered Manila's 200-nautical mile EEZ on July 2, spokesperson for the PCG Jay Tarriela told a news forum.</p>

<p>The PCG warned the Chinese vessel it was in the Philippine's EEZ and asked about their intentions, he said.</p>

<p>"It's an intimidation on the part of the China Coast Guard," Tarriela said. "We're not going to pull out and we're not going to be intimidated."</p>

<p>China's embassy in Manila and the Chinese foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. China's coast guard has no publicly available contact information.</p>

<p>The Chinese ship, which has also deployed a small boat, was anchored 800 yards away from the PCG's vessel, Tarriela said.</p>

<p>In May, the PCG deployed a ship to the Sabina shoal to deter small-scale reclamation by China, which denied the claim. China has carried out extensive land reclamation on some islands in the South China Sea, building air force and other military facilities, causing concern in Washington and around the region.</p>

<p>China claims most of the South China Sea, a key conduit for $3 trillion of annual ship-borne trade, as its own territory. Beijing rejects the 2016 ruling by The Hague-based Permanent Court of Arbitration which said its expansive maritime claims had no legal basis.</p>

<p>Following a high-level dialogue, the Philippines and China agreed on Tuesday for the need to "restore trust" and "rebuild confidence" to better manage maritime disputes.</p>

<p>The Philippines has turned down offers from the United States, its treaty ally, to assist operations in the South China Sea, despite a flare-up with China over routing resupply missions to Filipino troops on a contested shoal.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Reformist Masoud Pezeshkian won Iran's presidential runoff election on Saturday, defeating hardliner Saeed Jalili by a margin of around 2.8 million votes.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The 69-year-old president-elect aims to improve relations with the West and ease the mandatory headscarf law. While Pezeshkian respects Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's authority and seeks no major changes to Iran's government, he faces significant challenges – opposition from hardliners, the Israel-Hamas conflict, and Western concerns about Iran's nuclear program.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Here are some facts about Masoud Pezeshkian:</strong></h2>

<ol>
	<li dir="ltr">
	<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Masoud Pezeshkian was born on September 29, 1954, in Mahabad, West Azerbaijan, to an Azeri father and a Kurdish mother. He speaks Azeri and focuses&nbsp;on the affairs of Iran's minority ethnic groups. Mr Pezeshkian lost his wife Fatemeh Majidi and one of his daughters in a car accident in 1994. He chose not to remarry and raised his two other sons and daughter alone.</p>
	</li>
	<li dir="ltr">
	<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">He is a heart surgeon and has served as the head of the Tabriz University of Medical Sciences. He became a combatant and physician during the Iran-Iraq War (1980-1988), dispatching medical teams to the front lines.</p>
	</li>
	<li dir="ltr">
	<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Masoud Pezeshkian served as the Minister of Health, Treatment, and Medical Education under President Mohammad Khatami's administration. He has been a member of the Iranian Parliament, representing Tabriz, Azarshahr, and Osku across multiple terms (8th to 12th).&nbsp;He served as the first Deputy Speaker from 2016 to 2020.</p>
	</li>
	<li dir="ltr">
	<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">The 69-year-old had registered for presidential elections in 2011 and 2021. He withdrew in 2011 and was disqualified in 2021. In the 2024 presidential run, Pezeshkian campaigned with the slogan "For Iran," aiming to contrast his policies with those of his opponent Saeed Jalili.</p>
	</li>
	<li dir="ltr">
	<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Masoud Pezeshkian has been involved in several controversies. He attended the autopsy of Iranian-Canadian photojournalist Zahra Kazemi in 2003, who was detained, tortured, and died in custody. He cited intracranial hemorrhaging as the cause of death but claimed there were no signs of bruising or cuts, contradicting international outcry and demands for an investigation.</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">In 2017, Pezeshkian admitted to being among the first to prohibit women not wearing hijab from entering universities and hospitals in 1978, even before the mandatory hijab policy was officially introduced. In 2022, after Mahsa Amini's death, he said it was “unacceptable in the Islamic Republic” to arrest a girl for not wearing a hijab and then return her dead body to her family.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Akshata Murty stood by her husband Rishi Sunak as he delivered his final speech outside 10 Downing Street following a crushing loss to the Labour Party in the UK elections. While the results and the Conservative Party's future were the primary topics of discussion, social media couldn't help but fixate on Ms Murty's dress.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">Her red, white and blue chevron gown, identified as the 395 pound (Rs 42,000) Lina Dress from designer Omi Na Na, drew significant attention. Comments ranged from the colour scheme to the design, and even to the price tag. Although she was in the background, her outfit sparked speculation, with some wondering if her bold fashion choice – featuring the colours of the UK flag – was a tactical move to make a subtle statement amid the country's changing political dynamics.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">“Akshata Murty's dress is absolutely perfect for the occasion. The multi-layered symbolism is *chef's kiss*,” a user wrote on social media platform X.&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p dir="ltr">Rishi Sunak holds the distinction of being the richest person to have served as the Prime Minister of the UK. His wife Akshata Murty adds to their financial status as the daughter of Narayana Murthy, the billionaire founder of Infosys. According to the <a href="http:// https://www.thetimes.com/sunday-times-rich-list/profile/article/rishi-sunak-and-akshata-murty-net-worth-sunday-times-rich-list-blp6mk660 ">Sunday Times' 2024 Rich List</a>, the couple's combined fortune is estimated at an impressive 651 million pounds. This immense wealth makes them the wealthiest inhabitants of 10 Downing Street to date.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>People in the UK woke to a new dawn on Friday, with the Labour Party winning a landslide victory under its leader, Keir Starmer. The first Prime Minister of Indian origin, Rishi Sunak led his Conservative Party to its worst defeat in modern times. Its vote share fell to just 25.8% - worse than the previous lowest of 29.25% recorded by the Duke of Wellington in the 1832 election.</p>

<p>Although Sunak retained his own seat - Richmond and Northallerton in Yorkshire - about a dozen of his cabinet ministers lost theirs, including Penny Mordaunt, who was tipped as a future leader of the Conservative Party, and Defence Minister Grant Shapps. Some of the seats the party lost in Thursday's election had been Conservative for over a century.</p>

<p>The former prime minister, Liz Truss, whose unfunded tax cuts crashed the British economy in 2022 and forced her to resign in just 45 days in office, also lost. It was her resignation that had brought Sunak to power, seen in the Conservative Party then as the only person who could be trusted to fix the broken economy.</p>

<h2><strong>People Wanted Change</strong></h2>

<p>The main reason for the Conservatives' defeat was that people were crying for change after 14 years of rule. Although Sunak was able to immediately stabilise the economy, it was not an easy task to fix something that had been badly hit by Brexit, Covid, and the Russia-Ukraine war. It was during this time that India replaced Britain as the fifth-largest economy.</p>

<p>Sunak may have known a thing or two about business and economics, but he was never a popular politician. He lacked charisma and sound political judgment and was often accused of being a weak leader. Despite his promises and efforts, he could not improve the National Health Service and stop the small boats of illegal migrants reaching UK shores.</p>

<p>Although a former Brexiteer and right-of-centre politician, Sunak was regularly attacked by supporters of former Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who blamed him for his forced resignation. He also remained under fire during his time as prime minister from a group of ambitious right-wing fellow MPs, including Suella Braverman, another Indian-origin MP, who had been sacked by Sunak as Home Minister.</p>

<h2><strong>The Reform Juggernaut</strong></h2>

<p>But the most crucial factor that hit Sunak and his Conservative Party in this election was a right-wing party: Reform. Led by a firebrand veteran anti-immigration politician, Nigel Farage, Reform took sizable chunks of Conservative votes across the country, costing them at least a hundred seats. Farage himself got elected this time to parliament after seven failed attempts previously. Three other members of his party have also been elected.</p>

<p>It is a spectacular victory for Labour in Britain, a left-of-centre party. This is even more remarkable considering how much of Europe is tilting towards the far-right, with six countries in the continent having hard-right governments. Labour's victory is close to the one it achieved under the 43-year-old Tony Blair, when it won 418 seats with 43% of the vote. In this election, Labour under Starmer has won 412 seats with only 35% vote.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So, why is Labour's vote share in this election not that remarkable? Firstly, like Sunak, Starmer is also not a charismatic politician. Coming from a working-class background, he is a former human rights lawyer but not a popular person outside his own party. Many traditional Labour voters were angry with him for bringing the party to the centre and abandoning its socialist principles, and for his support for Israel. It lost a few seats to independents in sizable Muslim areas who successfully fought a pro-Palestinian campaign.</p>

<p>Some Labour supporters unhappy with Starmer's environment policy defected to the Greens, who won four seats in the parliament for the first time.</p>

<p>Jeremy Corbyn, the former leader of the Labour Party and a critic of India, won as an independent as he was expelled from Labour over his remarks about anti-Semitism.</p>

<h2><strong>How Indians Voted</strong></h2>

<p>A sizable number of Indians also voted against Labour and helped overturn a traditional Labour seat in Leicester in middle England in favour of the Conservatives. Shivani Raja's victory in Leicester East was one of the few good things in this election for Sunak's party. Bob Blackman, a vocal supporter of India in the British parliament, also retained his Harrow East seat by a big margin. It also indicated that at least some Indians have remained loyal to the Conservatives.</p>

<p>Although India got independence from Britain under a Labour government, in recent times, India's relations have been better under the Conservatives. Within the Labour Party, there is a strong pro-Pakistan lobby that tries to influence policy, though not very successfully. This has alienated many Indians.</p>

<p>But Keir Starmer is a pragmatic politician. As prime minister, he will try to retain good relations with India, though one would expect a Labour government to criticise India for its human rights violations and any unfair treatment of minorities.</p>

<p>One of Starmer's priorities will be to conclude a free trade agreement with India, on which the previous government already had done a lot of groundwork. Indian students, health workers, financial and computer experts play a key role in the British economy and the wider society. That is unlikely to change under the new government in Britain.</p>

<h2><strong>The Rocky Road Ahead</strong></h2>

<p>Like the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in India, Conservatives have a formidable election machine. So, after a postmortem and some recriminations, the party is expected to reorganise, as it has done in the past. But the scale of defeat will take them much longer this time to fully recover.</p>

<p>Rishi Sunak is expected to resign from the party leadership, but he will stay a little longer until a new leader is elected. He has already promised to stay in parliament despite reports that he may return to the US to take a lucrative job in the corporate world. The election of a new leader will show where the party intends to head. The challenge of Nigel Farage's Reform Party will tempt the Conservatives to push to the right. But there are others in the party who will argue that it needs to get back to the centre if it wants to defeat Labour in the next election.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As Masoud Pezeshkian emerges victorious from Iran's presidential election, defeating hardliner Saeed Jalili, his presidency promises a shift towards more pragmatic and reformist policies. But how will Mr Pezeshkian's presidency reshape Iran-India relations?</p>

<p>Mr Pezeshkian, a seasoned lawmaker and cardiac surgeon, has long supported both domestic and international reforms in Iran. His win is viewed as a call for change since it follows a general unhappiness with the hardline policies of his predecessors. But the dynamics of Iranian politics, where hardliners still control the majority and the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei retains ultimate authority, will put Mr Pezeshkian's ability to carry out his vision to the test.</p>

<p><strong>READ </strong>| <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/iran-reformist-masoud-pezeshkian-leads-in-runoff-vote-against-hardline-candidate-saeed-jalili-6044941">Iran Reformist Pezeshkian Defeats Hardliner Jalili In Presidential Polls</a></p>

<p>"Today, we are holding the second round of the presidential election. More than 700 polling centres are accepting the vote of Iranians. We hope that by tomorrow morning we will have a new president. There will be no changes in Iranian foreign policy and internal policy. Both discourses emphasise strengthening Iranian power internally and externally," said Iran's ambassador to India, Iraj Elahi.</p>

<h3><strong>India-Iran Ties</strong></h3>

<p>India and Iran have historically enjoyed strong economic ties. Under Pezeshkian's presidency, these ties are likely to deepen.</p>

<p>The focus will be especially on the strategic Chabahar Port, a project to which India has already committed heavy investments. It is an important transit point for trade with Afghanistan and Central Asia, bypassing Pakistan. India has pledged $120 million for the development of the Shahid-Beheshti Port terminal and offered a $250 million credit line for infrastructure projects in Iran. Experts believe that Iran's general foreign policy is unlikely to change whoever takes over next; modus operandi and details may, however, be different.</p>

<p>Iran is one of India's key sources of crude oil. With Iran eyeing an increase in the exports of oil against the backdrop of ongoing Western sanctions, India could be looking at a reliable and arguably cheaper source of crude oil.</p>

<p>The Pezeshkian approach to regional security will be closely watched in New Delhi. His stand related to keeping up the Axis of Resistance" against Israel and strategic regional siding with forces against what he calls "the Zionist regime" could continue to impact India's tightrope diplomacy in the region.</p>

<p>Another platform for close cooperation between India and Iran is the International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC), a multi-modal transportation route connecting India to Russia via Iran. This corridor increases connectivity in terms of trade and bilateral ties for regional stability.</p>

<h3><strong>Iran Elections</strong></h3>

<p>The presidential election in Iran takes place in the backdrop of former President Ebrahim Raisi passing away in a helicopter crash on May 19. The polls saw the lowest turnout of voters since the 1979 Islamic Revolution as only 39.92 per cent of eligible voters took part.</p>

<p>The Iranian government had predicted, and Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei forecasted a higher turnout. State television showed modest lines at polling centres, while online videos depicted empty polls and light traffic at some sites in the capital, Tehran, reportedly with a heavy security presence.</p>

<p>The elections were held amid heightened regional tensions. In April, for instance, Iran launched its first direct attack on Israel amid the latter's ongoing aggression in Gaza. This was then followed by an intensification of attacks by militant groups, including Lebanon's Hezbollah and the Houthis of Yemen, both armed by Tehran.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While Ayatollah Khamenei has the last word on state affairs, it remains to be seen if the Middle Eastern nation adopts a change in its foreign policy in light of recent events.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At least 80 people were killed in an attack by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) on a village in Sinnar state in central Sudan, a volunteer group said.</p>

<p>"The RSF launched a bloody attack yesterday (Thursday) on the Jalqni village of (Abu Hujar locality) in Sinnar state, after a five-day siege, killing at least 80 people," the Sinnar Youth Gathering said on Friday in a statement.</p>

<p>"The attack came after the RSF tried to kidnap girls from the village, which the residents resisted, leading to this massacre," the statement said.</p>

<p>It added that the "RSF militia" responded to the citizens' resistance by opening fire indiscriminately and storming homes, Xinhua news agency reported.</p>

<p>The RSF has not yet issued any comment on the incident.</p>

<p>Since June, the RSF has controlled large parts of Sinnar state, including the state's capital city of Singa, while the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) controls the eastern Sinnar area.</p>

<p>According to the International Organisation for Migration, the fighting in Sinnar state has displaced more than 725,000 people.</p>

<p>Sudan has been witnessing a deadly conflict between the SAF and the RSF since April 15, 2023, which has resulted in the loss of at least 16,650 lives.</p>

<p>An estimated 10.7 million people are now internally displaced in Sudan, with nearly 2.2 million others seeking refuge in neighbouring countries, according to recent UN data.</p>

<p>Ceasefire talks began on Wednesday in Switzerland, hosted by US, Saudi and Swiss mediators, though the Sudanese army refused to take part.</p>

<p>Previous rounds of negotiations in Jeddah in Saudi Arabia have failed to produce an agreement to end the fighting.</p>

<p>The RSF, which since April 2023 has been battling Sudan's regular army, captured the Sennar state capital of Sinja in June.</p>

<p>The state connects central Sudan to the army-controlled southeast, where hundreds of thousands of people have sought refuge.</p>

<p>The RSF controls most of the capital Khartoum, the central state of Al-Jazira, the vast western Darfur region and large swathes of Kordofan in the south.</p>

<p>The war pits Army Chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan against the RSF led by his former deputy Mohamed Hamdan Daglo.</p>

<p>It has pushed the country of 48 million to the brink of famine, according to the United Nations, and killed tens of thousands of people, with some estimates of up to 150,000, according to US envoy to Sudan Tom Perriello.</p>

<p>More than 10 million people are currently displaced across Sudan, most in areas facing worsening humanitarian conditions as fighting spreads.</p>

<p>Both sides have been accused of war crimes, including deliberately targeting civilians and blocking humanitarian aid.</p>

<p>Despite the Sudanese army's no-show at the Switzerland negotiations, Perriello told AFP the talks were having some success, simply by casting international focus on Sudan at a time "when the world was turning its attention away".</p>

<p>Burhan's authorities have announced that the western Adre border crossing with Chad was set to reopen for humanitarian deliveries.</p>

<p>Opening the crossing "has been an essential demand for months now, to move humanitarian aid into some of the parts of Darfur that have had the most acute starvation and hunger," Perriello said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>OpenAI said on Friday it had taken down accounts of an Iranian group for using its ChatGPT chatbot to generate content meant for influencing the U.S. presidential election and other issues.</p>

<p>The operation, identified as Storm-2035, used ChatGPT to generate content focused on topics such as commentary on the candidates on both sides in the U.S. elections, the conflict in Gaza and Israel's presence at the Olympic Games and then shared it via social media accounts and websites.</p>

<p>Investigation by the Microsoft-backed AI company showed that ChatGPT was used for generating long-form articles and shorter social media comments.</p>

<p>OpenAI said the operation did not appear to have achieved meaningful audience engagement.</p>

<p>Majority of the identified social media posts received few or no likes, shares or comments and the company did not see indications of web articles being shared across social media.</p>

<p>The accounts have been banned from using OpenAI's services and the company continues to monitor activities for any further attempts to violate policies, it said.</p>

<p>Earlier in August, a Microsoft threat-intelligence report said Iranian network Storm-2035, comprising four websites masquerading as news outlets, is actively engaging U.S. voter groups on opposing ends of the political spectrum.</p>

<p>The engagement was being built with "polarizing messaging on issues such as the U.S. presidential candidates, LGBTQ rights, and the Israel-Hamas conflict," the report stated.</p>

<p>Democratic candidate Kamala Harris and Republican rival Donald Trump are locked in a tight race, ahead of the Nov. 5 presidential election.</p>

<p>The AI firm said in May it had disrupted five covert influence operations that sought to use its models for "deceptive activity" across the internet.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US Secretary of State Antony Blinken will travel to Israel this weekend to push forward a Gaza ceasefire deal as the United States tries to bridge the gaps in talks in the region, the State Department said.</p>

<p>Blinken will leave Saturday and seek to "conclude the agreement for a ceasefire and release of hostages and detainees through the bridging proposal" presented Friday during talks in Doha by the United States, a State Department statement said.</p>

<p>President Joe Biden earlier Friday said that "we are closer than we have ever been" to a ceasefire in the 10-month-old Gaza war after two days of talks in the Qatari capital Doha.</p>

<p>"We're not there yet. It's much, much closer than it was three days ago. So keep your fingers crossed," Biden said.</p>

<p>Biden spoke by telephone with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani to discuss the "significant progress" in the talks, National Security Council spokesman Sean Savett said.</p>

<p>Biden and the two key Arab leaders had publicly urged Hamas and Israel to join the talks.</p>

<p>The White House said diplomats will keep working on details with a hope to conclude the accord later next week in Cairo.</p>

<p>"This is kind of the final stage -- the end game of the process," a senior US official told reporters on customary condition of anonymity.</p>

<p>The diplomats are setting up an "implementation cell" so that an agreement will "be implemented rapidly once deal is included," he said.</p>

<p>The State Department statement said the proposal "would achieve a ceasefire in Gaza, secure the release of all hostages, ensure humanitarian assistance is distributed throughout Gaza and create the conditions for broader regional stability."</p>

<p>"Secretary Blinken will underscore the critical need for all parties in the region to avoid escalation or any other actions that could undermine the ability to finalize an agreement," it said.</p>

<p>It will be the ninth trip by Blinken to the Middle East since Hamas on October 7 carried out the deadliest-ever attack on Israel, which has responded with a relentless military campaign in Gaza.</p>

<p>The State Department did not immediately announce any stops after Israel. Blinken has met with key Arab allies on previous trips.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United Nations said Friday there were strong indications that the Bangladeshi security forces used unnecessary force in tackling the student-led uprising that ousted premier Sheikh Hasina.</p>

<p>Sheikh Hasina, 76, fled to neighbouring India by helicopter last week as demonstrators flooded Dhaka's streets in a dramatic end to her iron-fisted rule of 15 years.</p>

<p>More than 450 people were killed in the weeks of protests leading up to her ousting on August 5.</p>

<p>"There are strong indications, warranting further independent investigation, that the security forces used unnecessary and disproportionate force in their response to the situation," the UN human rights office said in a preliminary report.</p>

<p>"Alleged violations included extrajudicial killings, arbitrary arrests and detention, enforced disappearances, torture and ill-treatment, and severe restrictions on exercise of freedoms of expression and peaceful assembly."</p>

<p>The report stressed the need for a rapid restoration of law and order, and the need to prevent further loss of life, violence and acts of reprisals.</p>

<p>The interim government replacing Sheikh Hasina, led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, has invited UN investigators to probe the violent "atrocities" that accompanied her ousting.</p>

<p>Yunus, 84, returned from Europe last week to head a temporary administration that faces the monumental challenge of steering democratic reforms.</p>

<p>UN human rights chief Volker Turk said the transition in Bangladesh was a chance to ensure governance is anchored in rights and the rule of law.</p>

<p>"The transition ahead presents an historic opportunity to reform and revitalise the country's institutions, to restore fundamental freedoms and civic space, and to give all in Bangladesh a part in building the future," he said.</p>

<p>"Accountability for violations and justice for the victims are key for the way forward, and will need to be accompanied by a national healing process," he said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A small aerobatic plane crashed into the sea Friday during an airshow off the coast of southeast France with the pilot trapped inside, officials said.</p>

<p>The Fouga Magister aircraft was performing at Le Lavandou just before a demonstration by the French air force's elite acrobatic flying team, a French air force spokesman told AFP.</p>

<p>Built after World War II, the Fouga Magister was for many years used by the French army as a trainer jet and aerobatic plane. It has no ejection seat.</p>

<p>A rescue operation quickly found the body of the 65-year-old pilot, the prefecture and officials said.</p>

<p>The show was cancelled due to the "tragic circumstances", military officials said.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, two French pilots died after two Rafale fighter jets collided in mid-air in eastern France, in a rare accident involving the country's leading military jet.</p>

<p>A third pilot ejected following the crash over Colombey-les-Belles, a town in northeastern France.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A coalition using NASA-developed technology and backed by philanthropists including former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg will launch the first in a series of satellites on Friday to pinpoint leaks of the planet-warming gas methane from space.</p>

<p><strong>Why it's important</strong></p>

<p>The launch, aboard the SpaceX Transporter-11 Rideshare mission, is a milestone for the Carbon Mapper Coalition, which was formed in 2021. The partnership includes NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, satellite firm Planet Labs, RMI and Arizona State University, with financial backing from High Tide Foundation, Bloomberg Philanthropies, Grantham Foundation for the Protection of the Environment, Zegar Family Foundation and Children's Investment Fund Foundation.</p>

<p>The satellite, called Tanager-1, will be able to spot methane leaks from individual facilities such as oil refineries and landfills. The technology is meant to help polluting industries find and plug leaks, and data will be available through a public online portal.</p>

<p>Carbon Mapper plans to launch additional satellites that, combined, will be able to track up to 90% of the world's large methane plumes daily.</p>

<p>Scientists say identifying methane sources is crucial to making the drastic emissions cuts needed to avoid the worst impacts of climate change.</p>

<p><strong>Key Quote</strong>&nbsp;</p>

<p>"There is more momentum than ever to act on climate. But a lack of public and private investment in global methane and CO2 monitoring has left gaps that leave many emissions untracked and unaddressed," Richard Lawrence, founder of High Tide Foundation, said in a statement.</p>

<p><strong>By the numbers</strong></p>

<p>Methane is more than 80 times more powerful than carbon dioxide in its first 20 years in the atmosphere.</p>

<p>"Super-emitters," or sources that emit more than 100 kilograms (220 lb) of methane per hour, contribute up to 20% to 60% of a region's total emissions in some sectors, Carbon Mapper Chief Executive Riley Duren said.</p>

<p>SpaceX will launch the satellite from Vandenberg Space Force Baser in California. The 53-minute window for launch opens at 11:20 am local time (1820 GMT).</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The World Health Organization declared mpox a global public health emergency for the second time in two years, following an outbreak of the viral infection in the Democratic Republic of Congo that has spread to neighbouring countries.</p>

<p>A new form of the virus, clade Ib, triggered global concern as it seems to be spreading quickly and little is known about the strain. The disease transmits through close contact.</p>

<p>The following are the countries that have reported cases of clade Ib mpox:</p>

<p><strong>Democratic Republic Of Congo</strong></p>

<p>Two strains of mpox are spreading in the Democratic Republic of Congo - the endemic clade I and the new clade Ib, which spreads more easily through close contact, including sexual.</p>

<p>The current outbreak has seen 27,000 cases and more than 1,100 deaths since January 2023, largely among children.</p>

<p><strong>Sweden</strong></p>

<p>Global health officials on August 15 confirmed an infection with a new strain of the mpox virus in Sweden, the first sign of its spread outside the African continent.</p>

<p>Swedish health officials said at a press conference that the person was infected while in Africa with the clade Ib type of mpox involved in the recent outbreak. The person is receiving treatment.</p>

<p><strong>Burundi</strong></p>

<p>Burundi's Ministry of Health has investigated and confirmed 61 cases of clade Ib mpox distributed across several districts as of August 9. No deaths had been documented at the time of reporting, according to WHO data.</p>

<p><strong>Kenya</strong></p>

<p>On July 29, Kenya's health ministry confirmed one case of clade Ib mpox, the first-ever case of mpox identified in the country. No deaths had been reported as of August 8, according to WHO data.</p>

<p><strong>Rwanda</strong></p>

<p>As of August 7, four confirmed clade Ib mpox cases and zero deaths had cumulatively been reported by the country, according to WHO data.</p>

<p><strong>Uganda</strong></p>

<p>Uganda identified two cases of clade Ib mpox, the first confirmed mpox cases identified in the country. Investigations revealed that transmission occurred outside Uganda and no secondary transmission had been linked to the two cases as of August 2.</p>

<p>No deaths have been reported as of August 8, according to WHO data.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Spain has just emerged from a 21-day heatwave that engulfed Madrid, Barcelona and Zaragoza, posing a health threat which extends far beyond the actual temperature, according to Julio Diaz, a researcher at Madrid's Carlos III Health Institute.</p>

<p><strong>Isn't heat what kills during a heatwave?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>"The impact of heat on health is far more than just temperature... its effect can be felt across income levels, age groups, socio-economic conditions, healthcare, and different cultural approaches to heat," says Diaz.</p>

<p>"We divided Spain into 182 regions... and in each one, we worked out the temperature at which people start to die as a result of the heat. In Seville, 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) is not even classed as a heatwave, whereas in A Coruna (in northwestern Spain), the temperature which defines a heatwave is 26 degrees.</p>

<p>"When there is a heatwave, only 3.0 percent of mortality is due to heat stroke. Heat kills by aggravating other illnesses."</p>

<p><strong>Why are the first heatwaves the most deadly?</strong></p>

<p>"In the first heatwave (of the year) much more people are likely to be susceptible (to death) than the second because it claims the frailest, leaving fewer susceptible people in the second and fewer still in the third... That's why the first heatwave always has a greater impact on mortality. This is what in epidemiology we call the 'harvest effect'."</p>

<p><strong>Why are living standards a factor?</strong></p>

<p>"It's clear that the impact of heat is much greater in poorer neighbourhoods.</p>

<p>"It is not the same thing to experience a heatwave in a room with three people and one window and no air conditioning or fan, than going through the same thing in a villa with a swimming pool.</p>

<p>It's not even a question of having air conditioning or not, but about being able to turn it on. During this heatwave, the price of electricity in Spain skyrocketed."</p>

<p><strong>What is heatstroke?</strong></p>

<p>"Heatstroke happens when a person is exposed to high temperatures... and their body is not able to regulate that temperature. If you go out in the sun at 42C or exercise at those temperatures, your body is unable -- no matter how much it sweats, which is the main mechanism for regulating heat -- to lower and maintain its temperature at 37C.</p>

<p>When your body is no longer at 37C... your organs stop working properly, including your brain. Then hyperthermia sets in and the person can die."</p>

<p><strong>What is 'heat culture'?</strong></p>

<p>"In 2003, Europe suffered a brutal heatwave and 70,000 people died in 15 days. People were not prepared, and there were no prevention plans, which meant it had a brutal impact on mortality. Now nobody doubts that heat kills.</p>

<p>But people adapt. Between 1983 to 2003, for every degree above the temperature classed as a heatwave, the mortality in Spain increased by 14 percent. But after 2003, it barely increased by three percent.</p>

<p>In a city like Madrid, you never used to see older people wearing shorts but nowadays they all wear them -- you see them going out for a walk wearing a hat and with a bottle of water.</p>

<p>In places where they are used to having heatwaves, there are now much more air conditioning units and secondly, homes are much more adapted to cope with this heat.</p>

<p>People don't go out from 3:00 pm, that's why the siesta exists in Spain. And in the southern Andalusia region, the villages are painted white and the streets are wide so the wind can freely circulate."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Undertakers are working like bricklayers in a Gaza cemetery, piling cinder blocks into tight rectangles, side by side, for freshly dug graves.</p>

<p>More than 10 months into the Gaza war, so many bodies are arriving at the cemetery in Deir el-Balah that the men, working in the hot sun, hardly have space to bury them.</p>

<p>"The cemetery is so full that we now dig graves on top of other graves, we've piled the dead in levels," says Saadi Hassan Barakeh, leading his team of gravediggers.</p>

<p>Barakeh, 63, has been burying the dead for 28 years. In "all the wars in Gaza", he says he has "never seen this".</p>

<p>Previously, Barakeh also oversaw burials at the nearby Ansar cemetery, which covers 3.5 hectares (8.6 acres).</p>

<p>But now "the Ansar cemetery is completely full. There were too many dead", he says, his clothes smeared in dirt from digging graves.</p>

<p>He now handles just the Al-Soueid cemetery, with its 5.5 hectares of graves. Yet even with one cemetery instead of two, he works "every day, from six in the morning to six in the evening".</p>

<p>"Before the war, we had one or two funerals per week, maximum five," he says, wearing a white prayer cap that matches his long beard.</p>

<p>"Now, there are weeks when I bury 200 to 300 people. It's unbelievable."</p>

<p><strong>'I can't sleep'</strong></p>

<p>Gaza's death count of just over 40,000 in more than 10 months of war, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry, is straining its people as well as its cemeteries.</p>

<p>Barakeh bears daily witness to the tragedies. Hoe in hand, he gives encouragement to his 12 workers as they prepare and close dozens of graves every day.</p>

<p>At night, however, some images are hard to forget.</p>

<p>"I can't sleep after seeing so many mangled children's bodies and dead women," he said, adding: "I buried 47 women from one family."</p>

<p>The October 7 Hamas attack which triggered the war resulted in the deaths of 1,198 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures.</p>

<p>Hamas operatives also seized 251 people, 111 of whom are still held in Gaza, including 39 the military says are dead.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory military offensive has killed at least 40,005 people in Gaza, according to the health ministry, which does not provide a breakdown of civilian and militant deaths.</p>

<p>"I buried a lot of women and children, and only two or three guys from Hamas," says Barakeh.</p>

<p><strong>'Why the children?'</strong></p>

<p>If Israelis "have a problem with (Yahya) Sinwar, why do they harm children?" he adds, referring to the alleged October 7 attacks mastermind who is now Hamas's overall leader.</p>

<p>"Let them kill Sinwar and all the others, but why the women and children?"</p>

<p>Mounds of freshly dug soil are reminders of recent burials. Graves with white headstones fill nearly all the available space, while men dig new holes in the few vacant areas.</p>

<p>The team forms a human chain to carry the cinder blocks, whose price has soared since Gaza's factories closed due to a lack of fuel and raw materials.</p>

<p>"One shekel ($0.27) before the war, 10 or 12 today," he lamented.</p>

<p>Besides gravediggers and the workers carrying cinder blocks, hardly anyone comes to funerals anymore, Barakeh says.</p>

<p>"Before the war, there were sometimes 1,000 people at one funeral; today there are days when we bury 100 people and there aren't even 20 to lay them to rest."</p>

<p>High above his head, the constant hum of an Israeli surveillance drone serves as a reminder of the aerial threat creating a steady stream of bodies.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Elon Musk's microblogging site X has been ordered to pay compensation to a former employee in an unfair dismissal case.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Elon Musk's microblogging site X has been ordered to pay compensation to a former employee in an unfair dismissal case. According to <em>Fortune</em>, the social media platform, formerly known as Twitter, was ordered to pay over $602,640 (approximately Rs 5 crore) to Gary Rooney, who was fired in December 2022 after Mr Musk's takeover of the company. Mr Rooney held a senior procurement role at the time of his dismissal. He had been employed by X since September 2013.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On Tuesday, Ireland's Workplace Relations Commission held Mr Rooney had been unfairly dismissed in 2022 and ordered X to pay him a huge amount - the largest sum the agency has ever awarded, per the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://fortune.com/europe/2024/08/14/x-ordered-to-pay-550000-to-irish-employee-fired-for-not-replying-to-elon-musk-yes-or-resign-extremely-hardcore-ultimatum/">outlet</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In November 2022, shortly after Mr Musk's takeover of X, the billionaire sent a company-wide email demanding employees commit to working "long hours at high intensity" or receive a big payout. Employees, including Mr Rooney, were given a day to click "yes" on the email to accept the new working conditions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Commission heard that X maintained that the employee had resigned voluntarily after he failed to tick a box committing to new unspecified working arrangements in an email from the company's new owner Elon Musk.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Also Read |&nbsp;<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/bill-gates-escaped-tightly-scheduled-life-by-visiting-warren-buffett-reveals-new-book-6351408">Bill Gates Escaped Tightly Scheduled Life By Visiting Warren Buffett, Reveals New Book</a></strong></p>

<p>However, the Irish Workplace Relations Commission refused to buy this argument and ruled that not clicking "yes" in response to the email did not constitute an act of resignation. "It is not OK for Mr. Musk, or indeed any large company to treat employees in such a manner in this country or jurisdiction. The record award reflects the seriousness and the gravity of the case," the complainant's solicitor Barry Kenny said, per the outlet.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, this is one of the cases that sprung up since Mr Musk purchased the micro-blogging site. Multiple lawsuits have already alleged that X employees did not receive their promised severance benefits.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Elon Musk acquired Twitter in October 2022 in a $44 billion deal. He laid off almost half the employees shortly after his takeover of the company and sent a hardcore ultimatum to the remaining staff.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Hamas will not accept "new conditions" from Israel in a proposal put forward during talks in Doha aimed at sealing a ceasefire and hostage release in the Gaza war, officials told AFP on Friday.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hamas said Friday the Palestinian group rejected "new conditions" in a Gaza ceasefire plan the United States presented after two days of talks with Israeli negotiators in Qatar.</p>

<p>As international pressure mounted for a ceasefire after more than 10 months of war between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip, US President Joe Biden said: "We are closer than we have ever been."</p>

<p>Washington has joined its European allies in pushing for a swift ceasefire in Gaza since the July 31 killing of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in an attack in Iran blamed on Israel prompted threats of retaliation and fears of a wider Middle East war.</p>

<p>Egyptian, Qatari and US mediators have been seeking to finalise details of a framework initially outlined by Biden in May, and which he said Israel had proposed.</p>

<p>But months of talks have so far failed to pin down the details of a truce and hostage release deal.</p>

<p>The mediators said that the two days of talks in Doha were "serious and constructive".</p>

<p>In a joint statement, they said the United States had presented a "bridging proposal" that sought to secure a rapid deal at a new round of talks in Cairo next week.</p>

<p>Hamas swiftly announced its opposition to what it called "new conditions" from Israel in the latest plan.</p>

<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu meanwhile called on the mediators to put "pressure" on Hamas "to accept the May 27 principles", referring to Biden's framework.</p>

<p><strong>'Need for calm'</strong></p>

<p>An informed source told AFP that the conditions Hamas objected to included keeping Israeli troops inside Gaza along the territory's border with Egypt, veto rights for Israel on the Palestinian prisoners to be exchanged for Israeli hostages, and the ability to deport some prisoners rather than send them back to Gaza.</p>

<p>Qatar's lead mediator, Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani spoke with Iran's acting foreign minister Ali Bagheri to brief him about the talks, the foreign ministry in Doha said.</p>

<p>"During the call, they reviewed ... the latest developments in the joint mediation efforts to end the war on the Strip, and stressed the need for calm and de-escalation in the region," the Qatari statement said.</p>

<p>Diplomatic pressure on Israel to agree a truce has increased in recent weeks.</p>

<p>Hamas officials, some analysts and protesters in Israel have accused Netanyahu of prolonging the war.</p>

<p>Ahead of a visit to Israel on Friday with French Foreign Minister Stephane Sejourne, British Foreign Secretary David Lammy said: "The risk of the situation spiralling out of control is rising."</p>

<p>Britain's foreign ministry said the two ministers would "stress there is no time for delays or excuses from all parties on a ceasefire deal" in Gaza.</p>

<p>Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz told his visiting counterparts he expects foreign support "in attacking" Iran if it strikes Israel in revenge for Haniyeh's killing.</p>

<p>Sejourne replied that it would be "inappropriate" to discuss responding to any attack while diplomacy is in high gear to stop it happening.</p>

<p><strong>'Abhorrent' settler attack</strong></p>

<p>A deadly attack by Israeli settlers in the occupied West Bank late Thursday drew international condemnation and calls for sanctions against those within the Israeli government who had enabled the upsurge in settler violence against Palestinians, particularly since the Gaza war began.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said "dozens of Israeli civilians, some of them masked", entered the village of Jit, west of Nablus, and "set fire to vehicles and structures in the area, hurled rocks and Molotov cocktails". A Palestinian man was shot dead.</p>

<p>Villager Hassan Arman said the settlers were armed with knives, a machine gun and a silencer.</p>

<p>"It was horrific," said UN human rights office spokeswoman Ravina Shamdasani.</p>

<p>"What is striking and important to remember is that yesterday's killing in Jit is not an isolated attack, and it is the direct consequence of Israel's policy of settlement in the West Bank," she added.</p>

<p>The Palestinian foreign ministry described the attack as "organised state terrorism".</p>

<p>The British foreign minister called the attack "abhorrent". The French minister said it was "unacceptable".</p>

<p>The EU's top diplomat Josep Borrell said he would propose sanctions against Israeli government "enablers" of Jewish settler violence.</p>

<p>"Day after day, in an almost total impunity, Israeli settlers fuel violence in the occupied West Bank, contributing to endanger any chance of peace," Borrell posted on X.</p>

<p>"The Israeli government must stop these unacceptable actions immediately," he wrote, vowing to "table a proposal for EU sanctions against violent settlers' enablers, including some Israeli government members".</p>

<p>The last was an apparent allusion to far-right ministers in the Israeli government.</p>

<p>One of them, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, was quick to join other Israeli leaders in condemning Thursday night's attack by "criminals".</p>

<p><strong>'We are being killed'</strong></p>

<p>Hamas's unprecedented October 7 attack on Israel triggered the war that resulted in the deaths of 1,198 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures.</p>

<p>Militants also seized 251 hostages, 111 of whom are still held in Gaza, including 39 the military says are dead. More than 100 were freed during a one-week truce in November.</p>

<p>On Thursday, the toll from Israel's retaliatory military campaign in Gaza topped 40,000, according to the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza, which does not provide a breakdown of civilian and militant casualties.</p>

<p>As the Gaza truce talks drag on, bombs have continued to fall in the Palestinian territory.</p>

<p>"Why did Netanyahu send a delegation to the talks while we are being killed here?" in Jabalia, Mohammed al-Balwi asked among the concrete debris left from a deadly air strike Thursday in north Gaza.</p>

<p>They had found "limbs on the ground", he said.</p>

<p>Witnesses reported air raids on Friday in central Gaza and near the southern city of Khan Yunis.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[The World Health Organization has declared that an outbreak of mpox, a viral infection that spreads through close contact, represents a global health emergency for the second time in two years. Mpox causes flu-like symptoms and pus-filled lesions.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<ol>
	<li>While usually mild, mpox can kill. Children, pregnant women and people with weakened immune systems, such as those with HIV, are all at higher risk of complications. The WHO declared the recent outbreak of the disease a public health emergency after a new offshoot of the mpox virus, first identified in Democratic Republic of Congo, began spreading to other neighbouring countries.</li>
	<li>Mpox transmits through close physical contact, including sexual contact, but there is no evidence that it spreads easily through the air. The new offshoot has caused global alarm because it appears to spread more easily between people.</li>
	<li>Two years ago, the WHO declared mpox was an emergency when a form of the disease, 'clade IIb', began to spread globally, largely among men who have sex with men. That outbreak was brought under control after behaviour change and safe sex practices, plus vaccines, helped people at risk protect themselves in many countries.</li>
	<li>But mpox has been a public health problem in parts of Africa for decades. The first ever human case was in Congo in 1970, and it has had outbreaks ever since. The current outbreak, Congo's worst ever, has seen 27,000 cases and more than 1,100 deaths since January 2023, largely among children.</li>
	<li>Two strains of mpox are now spreading in Congo - the endemic form of the virus, 'clade I', and a new offshoot called 'clade Ib', with the term 'clade' referring to a form of the virus. The new offshoot has now moved from eastern Congo to Rwanda, Uganda, Burundi and Kenya.</li>
	<li>Sweden reported the first case of the new form, 'clade Ib', outside Africa on Thursday. A WHO spokesperson said the case reiterated the need for partnership, and the agency continues to advise against travel restrictions to stop the spread of mpox. Pakistan on Friday also confirmed a case of the mpox virus in a patient who had returned from a Gulf country, though it was unclear whether it was of the new variant or of the clade that has been spreading globally since 2022.</li>
	<li>But in 2022, a WHO appeal for $34 million to fight mpox got no take-up from donors, and there was huge inequity in who had access to vaccine doses. African countries had no access to the two shots used in the global outbreak, made by Bavarian Nordic and KM Biologics.</li>
	<li>Two years later that remains the case, although there are efforts to change that, the WHO said on Wednesday as it appealed for dose donations from countries with stockpiles. Africa CDC said it has a plan to secure doses, without elaborating further, but stocks are currently limited.</li>
	<li>Fatality rates vary, and depend heavily on the healthcare available to the sickest patients. In Congo in this outbreak, the rate across both 'clade I' and 'clade Ib' has been around 4 per cent. 'Clade II', which spread globally, was much less deadly.</li>
	<li>However, mpox is not COVID-19. There are tools that are proven to work to stop the spread and help those at risk, and it does not spread as easily. The challenge now, which the emergency declarations aim to highlight, is making sure those tools reach those who need them most, in Congo and neighbouring countries.</li>
</ol>

       <description><![CDATA[While traditional media was squabbling over whether the live interaction between Elon Musk and Donald Trump was a conversation, a conversational interview or an interview, the chat crossed 200 million views, and 1 billion by the next morning.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-08/dugdl13_legacy-media_625x300_16_August_24.jpg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>Once again, social media has reminded the editors and managers of traditional media that when it comes to live events or disseminating news worldwide in real time, they cannot compete. While traditional media was squabbling over whether the live interaction on X between tech billionaire Elon Musk and Grand Old Party (GOP) nominee Donald Trump was a conversation, a conversational interview or an interview, the chat between the world's two most unavoidable men crossed 200 million views, as per Musk's claim in a post. The morning after, Musk tweeted again, saying the conversation had garnered one billion combined views - a jaw-dropping number for legacy media.</p>

<p>I was keeping a close eye on the event's coverage by traditional media. It was disappointing to see that much of it was mostly negative; the slew of headlines both in the UK and the US painted the two-hour interaction in a dark light. One headline screamed: "Trump's interview with Musk devolves into yet another X catastrophe". Legacy print media published a number of articles on the event. <em>USA Today</em> said it was an "unmitigated disaster", <em>The New York Times</em> called it a "two-hour ramble", and the <em>Washington Post </em>called it "softballs". Other traditional media outlets were no different: <em>CNN </em>compared the event to watching "Grumpy Old Men", and <em>MSNBC </em>called it a "failed" interview. Some focused more on the delay caused by a technical glitch. A <em>Guardian</em>&nbsp;analysis was headlined: "Elon Musk's X suffers tech failure at start of Donald Trump interview", while BBC said, "Musk's X talk with Trump hit by tech glitches".&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>UK Riots And Social Media&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p>In the hours after three young girls were brutally stabbed to death in the UK's Southport town on July 29, news and reactions began to flow on social platforms, such as TikTok, Instagram, Facebook and YouTube. There were real-time updates on the horrific incident on these platforms. On the other hand, many felt that the mainstream media offered a lukewarm coverage of the incident until all hell broke loose and widespread violent protests swept across towns and cities in England. The news of the three girls being killed was initially treated by the legacy media as a routine crime story after it emerged that there was no terror link. It was only after fake videos and unverified news began circulating widely and getting millions of views that established media woke up from its slumber. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The vacuum was filled by some notorious far-right people on social media who were accused of posting inflammatory material.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The British government named Elon Musk as one of those who were "stirring the pot". Reacting to the riots, Musk suggested in a post that "civil war is inevitable" in the UK. Responding to Prime Minister Keith Starmer's comments on the attacks on the Muslim community he asked, "Shouldn't you be concerned about attacks on all communities?". He also accused the police of being biased against protesters&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Billionaire Knows What He's Doing</strong></h2>

<p>Elon Musk appears to have learnt something from the fall of traditional media, which has been accused of lacking in innovation and stagnating; it desperately depends on social media platforms to amplify its content.</p>

<p>Musk has 194.4 million followers on X. He is the most followed man on the platform. The CEO of X, Linda Yaccarini, says the platform has 500 million active users a month. Surely, Musk is aware of this reach, and he is using it strategically to his advantage with a view to weaken the legacy media. One can see his strategy at play by the way he was able to pull off a two-hour interview with Trump and in the run-up to it how he drummed it up.</p>

<p>That was not an isolated incident. Musk came to Donald Trump's defence in March too when the latter said at a rally in Ohio that there would be a "blood bath" in the US if he lost the November election. He fired a series of posts on X in response to the coverage and urged the people to use his platform to share news instead of reading or watching it on traditional outlets. He accused the legacy media of lying about Trump's comment, saying his comment was taken out of context.</p>

<h2><strong>Open Challenge&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p>Elon Musk, described variously as a genius and innovator, besides being one of the richest men in the world, appears to have openly challenged the traditional media's established 200-year hegemony over news and current affairs. In one of his posts, he said, "Citizen journalism from actual domain experts and people actually on the ground is much faster, more accurate and has less bias than the legacy media". The claim of being "more accurate" and "less biased" can be contested, but not social media being "much faster" than the legacy media.</p>

<p>Social platforms, such as &nbsp;TikTok, YouTube, Instagram and Facebook, are officially still tech companies, but they have daily news capsules, real-time coverage of events and timeline postings, which cannot be matched by mainstream media. These have emerged as a big challenge to the established, legacy media.</p>

<p>Needless to say, many political parties and popular leaders of the world have robust social media strategies. They too have grasped the importance of speed and reach and often bypass the legacy media to reach out to their followers and voters of their countries, because they believe they interact more closely with their supporters through these platforms.</p>

<h2><strong>Will Legislation Help?</strong></h2>

<p>Europe has already passed a law to hold social media accountable. Now it's the British government's turn. Its Online Safety Bill aims to regulate social media platforms and protect users from harmful content. The Bill asks companies to remove fake and illegal content and establishes Ofcom (media regulators) as the regulator with the power to fine companies up to £18 million or 10% of annual global turnover for non-compliance. The legislation is expected to come into force by 2025. Some anti-far-right organisations have urged the government to implement it as early as possible. &nbsp;</p>

<p>But will that in some way curb the growing popularity of social media? Will it slow them down in terms of the speed with which they churn out news? Will the erosion of trust and threat to democracy argument hold good?&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>What Should The Legacy Media Do?</strong></h2>

<p>I can say with the authority of my 30 years of experience in mainstream Western media that they are still slow to innovate, as they were slow to embrace digital transformation and shy of collaborating with social media.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Digital transformation" is the buzzword in the <em>BBC </em>today. They are being bold in their leap to digitisation at the cost of traditional media, such as TV and radio. Also, it may sound bizarre, but <em>BBC News</em> is quite new to TikTok. It dawned on them only last year that they had lost out on the young audiences of TikTok who, they learnt, consumed news in bulk.</p>

<p>But it's a strategy full of risks. A balance between legacy and social media, along with innovation and speed, could be the key to surviving and staying stable. &nbsp;</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>UN agencies on Friday called for two seven-day breaks in the fighting in Gaza to vaccinate more than 640,000 children against polio, which has been detected in the wastewater.</p>

<p>The UN's health and children's agencies said they had drawn up detailed plans to reach children across the besieged Palestinian territory, starting later this month.</p>

<p>But that would require pauses in the fighting between Israel and Hamas, the World Health Organization and UNICEF said.</p>

<p>They said they were planning two rounds of a vaccination campaign across the Gaza Strip, starting in late August, against type 2 poliovirus (cVDPV2).</p>

<p>Last month, it was announced that type 2 poliovirus had been detected in environmental surveillance samples collected in Gaza on June 23.</p>

<p>"WHO and UNICEF request all parties to the conflict to implement humanitarian pauses in the Gaza Strip for seven days to allow for two rounds of vaccination campaigns to take place," they said.</p>

<p>A WHO spokeswoman said they were asking for seven days during each round.</p>

<p>"These pauses in fighting would allow children and families to safely reach health facilities and community outreach workers to get to children who cannot access health facilities for polio vaccination," the statement said.</p>

<p>"Without the humanitarian pauses, the delivery of the campaign will not be possible."</p>

<p>"The Gaza Strip has been polio-free for the last 25 years," said the WHO and UNICEF.</p>

<p>"Its re-emergence, which the humanitarian community has warned about for the last 10 months, represents yet another threat to the children in the Gaza Strip and neighbouring countries.</p>

<p>"A ceasefire is the only way to ensure public health security in the Gaza Strip and the region."</p>

<p>During each round of the campaign, the health ministry in Gaza, alongside UN agencies, would provide "two drops of novel oral polio vaccine type 2 (nOPV2) to more than 640,000 children under 10 years of age".</p>

<p>More than 1.6 million doses of nOPV2 were expected to transit through Israel's Ben Gurion Airport "by the end of August", the statement added.</p>

<p>Poliovirus, most often spread through sewage and contaminated water, is highly infectious. It can cause deformities and paralysis, and is potentially fatal. It mainly affects children under the age of five.</p>

<p>Hamas's unprecedented October 7 attack on Israel triggered the war that resulted in the deaths of 1,198 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures.</p>

<p>On Thursday the toll from Israel's retaliatory military campaign in Gaza passed 40,000, according to the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza, which does not provide a breakdown of civilian and militant casualties.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Despite his busy work schedule, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates used his meetings with Warren Buffett as an escape from work pressure, a new book, written by New York Times correspondent Anupreeta Das, revealed. In her book, titled <em>'Billionaire, Nerd, Savior, King: Bill Gates and his Quest to Shape the World'</em>, Ms Das wrote that every moment of the 68-year-old billionaire's workday was meticulously planned. His schedule, even down to his free time, was broken down into five-minute increments. But despite his demanding work schedule of back-to-back meetings, there were days when Mr Gates visited Mr Buffet to escape his responsibilities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.businessinsider.in/tech/news/bill-gatess-visits-to-warren-buffett-were-an-escape-from-a-jam-packed-schedule-new-book-says/amp_articleshow/112504250.cms"><em>Business Insider</em></a>, Ms Das in her book wrote that Mr Gates would take his private jet to Omaha just to visit Mr Buffett and get away from a "tightly scheduled life, including personal time, largely organised and arranged by" his then-wife Melinda French Gates.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"When Buffett asked Gates why he couldn't control his life and live it in a way he wanted to, Gates would simply shrug. 'Bill likes to have a schedule; I don't,' Buffett said in an email," Ms Das wrote.</p>

<p>The author also revealed that Mr Buffet, the chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, would even pick Mr Gates up from the airport sometimes, and the pair would have "freewheeling conversations". And when Mr Gates couldn't make it to Omaha, they'd play bridge together online, the book said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mr Buffett resigned from the Gates Foundation in 2021 and since then their friendship has cooled over the years. In May, the 68-year-old praised Mr Buffett's more relaxed approach to scheduling.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"It took far too long for me to realize that you don't have to fill every second of your schedule to be successful," Mr Gates wrote in a Threads post. "In hindsight, it's a lesson I could have learned a lot sooner had I taken more peeks at Warren Buffett's intentionally light calendar," he added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Notably, the friendship between the two began in 1991, when Bill Gates' mother, Mary Gates, invited him to spend the Fourth of July at their family retreat, the <em>New York Times </em>reported. Among the guests was Mr Buffett, whom Mr Gates initially dismissed as just a "stockbroker". However, once, they sat down, they connected instantly. This marked the beginning of their friendship that has lasted decades despite their very different personalities.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Carmaker BMW will recall 1.4 million vehicles in China due to faulty airbags, the country's market regulator announced on Friday.</p>

<p>Cars that have had steering wheel refits may have defective airbags from Japan's Takata Corporation that could rupture and "cause fragments to fly out and potentially injure occupants", the State Administration for Market Regulation said.</p>

<p>The affected cars include models manufactured from 2003 to 2017. Nearly 600,000 domestically produced cars, manufactured by the joint venture BMW Brilliance Automotive, and around 760,000 imported cars will be recalled.</p>

<p>For cars confirmed to have defects, the German automaker will replace the front airbag free of charge.</p>

<p>Millions of cars fitted with Takata airbags have been recalled since 2014, and the company went bankrupt three years later. Ford recalled three million vehicles containing Takata airbags in 2021.</p>

<p>In July this year, BMW recalled nearly 400,000 cars in the United States for the same reason.</p>

<p>China is the world's largest automotive market. Last month, hybrid and electric vehicles accounted for more than half of sales, marking a first in the highly competitive segment dominated by local brands.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 40-year-old Pakistani Sikh woman who was subjected to gang rape by her two kidnapper for nine months in Punjab province of Pakistan has been rescued, police said on Friday.</p>

<p>The incident took place in Faisalabad district of Punjab, some 130 kms from Lahore.</p>

<p>The police claim to have rescued both the Sikh woman and her minor son and arrested the alleged kidnapper/rapists.</p>

<p>According to Gender-Based Violence Unit head (Faisalabad) ASP Zainab Khalid, the Sikh woman, a resident of Nankana Sahib, was illegally confined by two brothers -- Khurram Shahzad and Kizar Shahzad -- of Faisalabad who repeatedly raped her for nine months.</p>

<p>The police officer said the woman, a divorcee, was introduced to suspect Khurrum by her friend Saima in Nankana Sahib a few years ago.</p>

<p>"In December last year, she asked Khurrum to drop her minor son at her sister's house in Faisalabad from Nankana Sahib. Instead, he took the boy hostage and forced the woman to come to her house in Sohailabad where he confined them both and raped her repeatedly along with his brother for nine months," the ASP said and added the police launched an investigation on the complaint of her relative and on August 14 raided the house of Khurrum and recovered her and her son.</p>

<p>ASP Khalid further said that the police team also managed to arrest both suspects.</p>

<p>The Sikh woman said that she was subjected to torture when she resisted rape.</p>

<p>A case has been registered against both arrested suspects of the Pakistan Penal Code.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The EU on Friday formally requested that Meta detail steps it is taking on transparency after the Facebook and Instagram owner scrapped a widely-used tool for tracking disinformation online.</p>

<p>Meta has been criticised on both sides of the Atlantic over the decision to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/meta-just-shut-a-vital-online-tool-its-bad-news-for-fight-against-misinformation-6348537">shut down CrowdTangle</a> -- a feature considered vital by researchers tracking viral falsehoods -- in a year of major election contests in the United States and elsewhere.</p>

<p>Unavailable since August 14, CrowdTangle is to be replaced with Meta's Content Library -- a technology researchers say offers nowhere near the same functionality.</p>

<p>The European Commission's request to Meta was sent under the bloc's Digital Services Act, a landmark new law that cracks down on illegal content online.</p>

<p>Brussels launched a formal investigation into Meta's Facebook and Instagram in late April, five weeks before bloc-wide elections in June, over concerns the platforms were failing to counter disinformation.</p>

<p>It raised the alarm in particular at plans to scrap CrowdTangle without an adequate alternative in place.</p>

<p>In its latest request, the commission asked Meta to provide details by September 6 on how it intends to give researchers access to publicly accessible data on its platforms, and how it plans to update its election monitoring functionalities.</p>

<p>"Specifically, the Commission is requesting information about Meta's Content Library and application programming interface (API), including their eligibility criteria, the application process, and the data that can be accessed and functionalities," said a commission statement.</p>

<p>CrowdTangle has been relied on for years by researchers and journalists seeking to track in real-time the spread of conspiracies and hate speech on Meta-owned platforms.</p>

<p>Organisations that debunk misinformation as part of Meta's third-party fact-checking program, including AFP, will have access to the Content Library instead -- but the new tool will not be accessible to for-profit media.</p>

<p>Killing off CrowdTangle is seen as a major blow in a year when dozens of countries are heading to the polls.</p>

<p>In an open letter earlier this year, the global nonprofit Mozilla Foundation warned that decommissioning CrowdTangle would be a "direct threat" to the integrity of elections, urging Meta to retain it at least until January 2025.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Authorities in the Kenyan city of Eldoret have removed the statues of three athletes after they were widely ridiculed and described as shoddy. According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/aug/15/a-violation-kenyan-town-removes-athlete-statues-after-uproar-about-unrecognisable-features"><em>The Guardian</em></a>, the statues were unveiled earlier this week to showcase the town's agricultural and sports heritage. The sculptures included statues of athletes and one of a maize cob next to a wheat stalk. However, the pictures of the statues attracted uproar on social media. Local residents and Kenyans poked fun at the statues online and criticised the town's administration and sculptors.&nbsp;</p>

<p>One particular statue that faced ridicule depicted a woman athlete running while holding a miniature Kenyan flag in her left hand. Sharing the picture of the statue on X (formerly Twitter), one user said that the works represented "our collective mediocrity as a country". "Eldoret City launch. Who is this? This is a violation," wrote another user. "This is shoddy and lousy to say the least. We can do better than this," commented a third.&nbsp;</p>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Another statue that caught the attention of social media users was of marathon legend Eliud Kipchoge. One user shared a picture of the sculpture and described it as a "joke". "Whoever did this will not see heaven," the user wrote.&nbsp;</p>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>After criticism, authorities in the Kenyan city removed the sculptures at night. The <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyxd93w4y2o"><em>BBC </em></a>reported that the county official removed three statues - two representing female athletes and one of a male. All the sculptures have been taken to an unknown location, officials said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Kenyans online welcomed the removal of the status. It is not clear whether the sculptures would be replaced, or when.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Eldoret was conferred city status earlier this week. At the same time, Kenyan President William Ruto honoured Kenyan medalists from the Paris Olympics at an event at Eldoret state lodge. The athletes later had an open-car parade, attracting cheers from thousands of residents who lined the city's streets to celebrate them.</p>

<p>Kenya was the highest-ranked African country at the Paris Olympics, coming 17th on the medal table with four golds, two silver and five bronze medals.&nbsp;</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The CEO of a private equity firm in the US has been arrested for allegedly strangling a 15-year-old boy who splashed a woman with water at an In-N-Out restaurant. According to <em>The Independent,</em> the incident took place on August 4. Lucas Kalisher, the 55-year-old CEO of Summit Source Funding LLC, was taken into custody by the Loveland Police Department (LPD) after he attacked the teenager and tossed him onto the floor of the restaurant. The boy had accidentally spilled water on the man's wife while he was messing around with his friends, cops said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The juvenile male approached her table to apologize when an adult male accompanying the woman suddenly grabbed him, placed both hands around the front and back of his neck, pulled him down to the table and threw him backward onto the floor," Loveland police said in an arrest report, per <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/crime/lucas-kalisher-in-n-out-burger-colorado-b2597066.html"><em>The Independent</em></a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Witnesses at the In-N-Out Burger watched the incident in shock. In a video posted on Facebook, one witness can be heard objecting, noting that the older and larger man was "picking on a kid".&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" height="476" scrolling="no" src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?height=476&amp;href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fniqquethe1%2Fvideos%2F412523701798393%2F&amp;show_text=false&amp;width=267&amp;t=0" style="border:none;overflow:hidden" width="267"></iframe></p>

<p>According to cops, the man and his wife left the restaurant before police arrived at the scene. However, witnesses identified the man, following which police issued a no-bond arrest warrant. The 55-year-old CEO then turned himself in to police on August 13.&nbsp;</p>

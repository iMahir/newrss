       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hong Kong's police force is taking on a campaign to install thousands of surveillance cameras across the city to ramp up their crime-fighting capabilities. The Chinese city, consistently ranked among the world's safest, plans to introduce facial recognition and artificial intelligence tools to enhance law enforcement. Critics, however, warn that this could come at the cost of privacy and freedom.</p>

<p>Hong Kong has close to 55,000&nbsp;public CCTV cameras, with plans to add 2,000 more this year, announced security Chief Chris Tang in July. The police force is considering equipping these cameras with facial recognition technology and AI tools to help identify suspects. “The police will definitely comply with relevant laws,” said the force in a statement to <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/10/05/asia/hong-kong-police-cameras-facial-recognition-intl-hnk-dst/index.html ">CNN</a>, though details on when these technologies might be deployed remain vague.</p>

<p>Experts are raising alarms about the repressive potential of surveillance technology, especially in Hong Kong. They draw parallels to mainland China's extensive surveillance systems, highlighting the heightened concern in Hong Kong, where political dissent has been severely limited since the national security law was introduced after the 2019 anti-government protests.</p>

<p>Hong Kong already has more than 54,500 public CCTV cameras, equating to about seven cameras per 1,000 people. That number puts it on par with major cities like New York, though far behind China's urban centres, where an average of 440 cameras per 1,000 people is commonplace.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mr Tang highlighted that countries like the UK have also started using facial recognition cameras. However, experts warn that even in these democracies, the implementation of such technology has raised significant concerns about privacy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Normann Witzleb, a professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said, “It's important to design guidelines for those systems that take proper recognition of the potential benefits that they have, but that also acknowledge they're not foolproof, and that they have the potential to interfere with (people's) rights in serious ways,” he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Steve Tsang, director of the SOAS China Institute, warned that the new cameras could be used for political repression under the guise of fighting crime. “This is likely to be a further step in making Hong Kong law enforcement closer to how it is done on the Chinese mainland,” he said.</p>

<p>Samantha Hoffman, a nonresident fellow at the National Bureau of Asian Research, noted, “The difference is how the technology is being used.” While Western democracies face their challenges with surveillance technology, she argues that the situation in Hong Kong is fundamentally different due to the legal framework supporting the government's authority. She remarked, “When you feel like you're being monitored, that affects your behaviour and your feelings of freedom,” as per CNN.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Typing this essay on a MacBook Air, tethered to an iPhone Pro (not the latest model) for accessing the internet, reeks of hypocrisy. Yet, certain issues need to be highlighted using all resources at hand. The news cycle around the sale of iPhone 16 across India is yet another reminder of how the industrially produced concoction of glamour, envy, and cultural imperialism continues to define most markets in the Global South.</p>

<p>Economics perceives envy-an essentially negative emotion - as a powerful driver for economic growth. It is said to positively impact "consumers' achievement motivation and raising their purchasing and spending rates". The more you envy, the more you intend to earn and spend. Owning an iPhone has been an envy-induced and inducing activity for many consumers ever since its launch in 2007. The sleek iPhone was the new Onida television, minus the devil hissing "neighbour's envy, owner's pride".</p>

<h2><strong>Simulation Is Supreme&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p>The iPhone is a curious gadget - it is both a product and a platform in the industrial production of glamour. Was it always intended to be so? Let's go to what experts were saying about the telecom revolution and the advent of the smartphone at the beginning of the 21st century. Thomas Elsaesser's 2005 observation is worth quoting in some detail:&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Will it be the sheer everyday usefulness, the universal popularity, and - lest we forget - the ruinous sums telecom firms have invested in licenses for "third-generation" cellphones that win the day, or kids playing computer-games that simulate ever more sophisticated parallel worlds? Whatever redefines the function of sound-and-images combinations in our culture, the entrepreneurial risks and the profitable stakes are equally high."</p>

<p>A quarter of a century later, the answer is clear. Simulation has squarely trumped any and all utility functions. Smartphone has become the space where people curate worlds for influence and clout.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>The World Of Influencers And Aspirations</strong></h2>

<p>Most discussions around social media obsession focus on the behaviour of the weak and the vulnerable: children/adolescents or the economically marginalised. How social media fuels aspirations, how the world of influencers prey on these aspirations, how children and other vulnerable groups see social media as empowering with all its possibilities, and such. What needs to be examined more, however, is how the adult 'haves' of society are vitiating it for the 'have-nots' by getting on an envy-horse and indulging in a reckless production of a sense of fascination. Posing with a high-end luxury shopping bag - even if it's empty-is not necessarily directed at the slum-dwellers. It's purely for the peers to consume and, hopefully, be envious of. The slum dwellers are mere collaterals of this glamour.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Kiran V Bhatia, while assessing children's digital experiences in Indian slums, notes that digitally produced glamour "allows users to compensate for the "lack" in their lives resulting from the socio-economic and cultural constraints they face". The slum children, for example, gain "liminal access to experiences they aspire to participate in" through social media images. Bhatia notes that this access and participation seldom result in actual upward mobility in class. This makes one thing clear: Though impacted perhaps the most, these children are not the intended audience for the garden variety glamour posters. Yes, they are important as "followers"-data.</p>

<h2><strong>'Curation' Is The Keyword</strong></h2>

<p>It must be added here that not all glamour is created around expensive commodities and experiences. There is enough pontificating about a new book - because one wants to signal intellectual moorings without possessing any. Or long posts around a newly acquired cultural signifier like wine because, finally, one has arrived. Curation is the keyword.</p>

<p>This curation, unbeknownst to the curator, is the first step towards iSlavery that scholars like Jack Linchuan Qiu want to be acknowledged and, consequently, abolished. Qiu argues, "Digital objects such as smartphones have not only failed to deliver their emancipatory promise, but have created instead new conditions of enslavement". The impact of this digital enslavement is for everyone to see: brain imaging has revealed that screen obsession is causing neurological disorders in children and adolescents, medical science research has established. What it is doing to adults is perhaps even more dangerous-adults are choosing to be enslaved to their life on the screen, unlike the children. They are the 'ultimate slaves', borrowing Orlando Patterson's phrase. Seemingly empowered, wealthy, controllers of narratives, but utterly vulnerable. Standing in a queue for more than twenty hours to buy the latest iPhone, or the inability to be one's authentic self, unless it's for another hey-look-at-me-this-is-the-real-me social media post - if this is not the vulnerability of the ultimate slaves, what is?</p>

<h2><strong>iSlavery</strong></h2>

<p>The cultural imperialism of the United States of America hinges on this digital ultimate slavery. The rapid global penetration in the global mobile sector&nbsp;of Apple's iPhone is incumbent mainly not so much on the end users marvelling at its technological leaps but on their ability to flaunt it as a possession. The possession that allows them to flaunt other possessions. Slavery exploits the body, whole or parts, in an abnormal labour-capital transaction, as Christian Fuchs puts it. What is being exploited in this case is the human brain-the site of ideas, emotions, and more.</p>

<p>And one day, it is bound to lead to anomie-nothingness.&nbsp;</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Imran Khan's party leaders have been staging protests, claiming that the Pakistan government should adhere to the constitution.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A leader of jailed former premier Imran Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf has said that the party plans to "invite" External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar to join its protests here, triggering a sharp response from the ruling coalition on Saturday. Mr Jaishankar will attend the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation's Council of Heads of Government (SCO-CHG) meeting in Pakistan on October 15 and 16.</p>

<p>Muhammad Ali Saif, an advisor on information to the chief minister of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province ruled by Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party, invited <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/1-member-of-saarc-practising-cross-border-terrorism-s-jaishankar-6725111">Mr Jaishankar</a> to participate in the ongoing protests while speaking on a Geo News programme late on Friday night.</p>

<p>"PTI will invite Jaishankar, Indian External Affairs Minister, to come and join PTI's protest and speak to our people and see that Pakistan is a strong democracy where everyone has a right to protest," Mr&nbsp;Saif said sarcastically in response to a question.</p>

<p>Reacting strongly, Attaullah Tarar, Federal Minister for Information and Broadcast and a leader of the major ruling partner Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), said Mr&nbsp;Saif's invitation to the Indian foreign minister is "highly irresponsible" and amounts to "enmity towards Pakistan."</p>

<p>Sarjeel Memon, Sindh province's Information Minister and a leader of another ruling partner Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), said: "Today the PTI is inviting Jaishankar to its protest and tomorrow it will call Israeli premier for the purpose. This party is anti-Pakistan and wants to sabotage the SCO summit through its protest."</p>

<p>Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said the PTI's invitation to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/not-going-there-to-discuss-india-pakistan-relations-jaishankar-on-his-upcoming-islamabad-visit-for-sco-summit-6721390">Mr&nbsp;Jaishankar</a> "put a question mark on the credibility of Khan's party."</p>

<p>However, after the government ministers' sharp reactions, Mr&nbsp;Saif said his statement about Mr Jaishankar was taken out of context.</p>

<p>The <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/pak-capital-locked-down-as-imran-khans-supporters-try-to-seize-the-streets-6722928">PTI has been staging protests</a>, claiming that the government should adhere to the constitution, pressing for the judiciary's independence, against rising inflation apart from demanding the release of its 72-year-old founder.</p>

<p>Currently incarcerated at the Adilala Jail in Rawalpindi, Khan was arrested on August 5, 2023. Facing dozens of cases, he has been convicted in a few of them.</p>

<p>On Saturday, Pakistan Army troops were deployed in Islamabad to ensure security ahead of the PTI's protest rally at the D-Chowk. The army would remain in the city from October 5-17 to maintain law and order for the upcoming SCO, the government had announced.</p>

<p>The authorities have taken strict measures to stop the PTI from entering Islamabad, blocking all highways leading to the city, banning pillion riding and suspending mobile phone services.</p>

<p>Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which bans public gatherings, political assemblies, and demonstrations, has also been imposed in the twin cities of Rawalpindi and Islamabad to outlaw any political assembly or protest.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thailand has found an unlikely star in Moo Deng, a temperamental yet lovable pygmy hippopotamus. Known for her attention-seeking antics, Moo Deng has now captivated international audiences with her latest viral performance: a "moonwalk" reminiscent of American singer-dancer Michael Jackson's iconic dance move.</p>

<p>A video circulating on X, formerly Twitter, shows the spirited hippo taking several smooth steps backward inside her enclosure, much to the amazement of onlookers. Her imitation of the King of Pop's legendary move has only cemented her status as a global sensation. “Whoa stop everything ... .Moo Deng doing the moonwalk,” the caption read.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/moo-deng-the-two-month-old-pygmy-hippo-who-has-become-viral-internet-sensation-6615610 ">Moo Deng</a>, the two-month-old pygmy hippo from Khao Kheow Open Zoo, is a viral sensation on platforms like TikTok and Instagram, amassing millions of views. Visitors flock to the zoo to see Moo Deng, who remains close to her mother, Jona.</p>

<p>In September, Moo Deng's popularity led to a <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/thai-zoo-that-homes-viral-pygmy-hippo-moo-deng-earns-4-times-more-now-6657099 ">4-fold increase in the zoo's revenue</a>. Fans from around the world queued for hours to see her, which resulted in the zoo to limit viewing time and set up a livestream.</p>

<p>Known as “bouncy pork” in Thai, Moo Deng has also become a symbol for raising awareness about the endangered pygmy hippo species.</p>

<p>The zoo also launched hippo-themed merchandise, with the profits aimed at improving animal facilities. However, the animal rights group PETA criticised the captivity of endangered animals like Moo Deng.</p>

<p>Despite being labelled as a “problematic pygmy” by some due to her feisty personality – most notably for playfully biting her trainer's leg – Moo Deng's fans remain loyal.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Elon Musk's endorsement, while notable, is not entirely unexpected. He has been a vocal supporter of Trump in the past and <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/elon-musk-donald-trump-pennsylvania-butler-assassination-site-2024-us-presidential-elections-6726322 ">recently attended a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania</a> – the same venue where the former president was nearly assassinated in July. He was seen wearing the same cap that he posted on his X account. During the event, Donald Trump acknowledged Elon Musk's presence by inviting him on stage and referred to him as an “incredible guy.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>In his speech, Elon Musk took a dig at US President Joe Biden, saying, “We had one president who couldn't climb a flight of stairs and another who is fist pumping after getting shot.” He went on to emphasise Trump's importance in the upcoming election, declaring, “Trump must win to preserve democracy in America.”</p>

<p>Donald Trump, speaking behind bulletproof glass at the rally, recalled the assassination attempt from July 13, where a bullet grazed his ear. He called the would-be assassin a “vicious monster.” Elon Musk, referencing the incident, said the 2024 election was the “most important election of our lifetime,” urging the crowd to rally behind Trump.</p>

<p>Elon Musk also encouraged supporters to take action, saying, “Get everyone you know, and everyone you don't know, drag them to register to vote. If they don't, this will be the last election. That's my prediction.”</p>

<p>Following the rally, Elon Musk took to <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1842706955497766939">his X account</a>, warning of a potential shift in the political landscape if Trump doesn't win, writing, “The Democratic Party will legalize so many illegals that there will be no swing states. America will become a single-party socialist state, just like what happened to California, where they just made requiring voter ID illegal.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Roasted by summer temperatures too hot for the beach, Dubai has turned to an innovative solution: opening them at night, complete with floodlights and lifeguards carrying night-vision binoculars.</p>

<p>The idea, in one of the world's hottest regions, with temperatures climbing ever higher through climate change, has proved popular -- more than one million people have visited the night beaches since last year, an official said.</p>

<p>Even with much of the region preoccupied with the widening conflict that pits Israel against Hamas, Hezbollah and Iran, the United Arab Emirates' giant neighbour, the night beaches remain busy on weekend evenings.</p>

<p>"The temperature drops down in the evening after the sun sets. So, yeah, it's amazing," said Mohammed, 32, from Pakistan, who brought his children to enjoy the sea without having to worry about the burning Gulf sun.</p>

<p>For residents of Dubai, a coast-hugging, desert metropolis of about 3.7 million people, the hot season from June to October is an annual trial.</p>

<p>With temperatures regularly topping 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit), often with high humidity, outdoor activities are severely limited.</p>

<p>The city now has more than 800 metres (yards) of designated night beaches fitted with shark nets and illuminated by giant, bright floodlights.</p>

<p>"While you're... bathing inside the water, you can see the sand even on your foot and your hands and everything," said Mohammed, who has lived in Dubai for a decade.</p>

<p>Lifeguards are posted 24 hours a day and, beyond the floodlights' glare, they use the night-vision binoculars to keep an eye on swimmers or kayakers further out in the water.</p>

<p>Officials are also testing an artificial intelligence camera system meant to detect when people are in distress.</p>

<p><strong>'Feels like a bath'</strong></p>

<p>At nearly midnight on a recent Friday, with temperatures still above 30C (86F), Umm Suqeim beach was packed with people -- mainly expatriates, who make up about 90 percent of the UAE's population.</p>

<p>Mary Bayarka, a 38-year-old fitness coach from Belarus, was enjoying being outside after a "long, hot day", even if the Gulf seawater was a little warm.</p>

<p>"It feels like (I'm) in a bath," she said.</p>

<p>Nearby, Filipina saleswoman Laya Manko was burying her body in the sand. The beach is an escape for the 36-year-old, one of the hundreds of thousands of migrant workers who keep Dubai's economy ticking.</p>

<p>"Every weekend we come here to have fun," she said. "Sometimes we sleep here with my friends.</p>

<p>"Because you work hard in Dubai, you feel you need to relax. Yes, this is my stress reliever," said Manko.</p>

<p>For the authorities, the night beaches are another way to tempt tourists, especially in summer when the stifling heat usually keeps them indoors.</p>

<p>"I believe we are one of the only cities in the world to have such infrastructure on public beaches at night," said Hamad Shaker, an official from the Dubai municipality.</p>

<p><strong>Extreme weather</strong></p>

<p>Dubai used to empty out in summer as expats fled the heat in droves, said Manuela Gutberlet, a tourism researcher at the University of Breda in the Netherlands.</p>

<p>But with attractions such as the world's tallest building, giant malls and indoor amusement parks, it has become "a year-round urban destination", attracting more than 17 million visitors last year, she said.</p>

<p>However, climate change could limit its ambitions, Gutberlet warned, citing the unprecedented rains that paralysed the city for several days in April.</p>

<p>Extreme weather events and a further rise in temperatures could discourage some visitors, she said, highlighting the need to "adapt quickly to new risks".</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Frenchman Laziz Ahmed, 77, found himself on the night beach during his first holiday in Dubai, where he was visiting relatives.</p>

<p>"During the day, I don't go out much," he said, adding that in the evening "I make up for it".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Supporters knelt and others bowed their heads as Donald Trump led a moment of silence at 6:11 pm, the time when shots rang out at a rally in the same rural Pennsylvania showground exactly 12 weeks earlier.</p>

<p>An opera singer belted out "Ave Maria" as a Secret Service sniper scanned the horizon with binoculars and a surveillance drone hovered above the tens of thousands of rallygoers. Heavily armed officers patrolled behind the stage.</p>

<p>The crowd in Butler periodically erupted into chants of "fight, fight, fight" -- echoing Trump's rallying cry just after the July 13 shooting that grazed his ear and briefly upended the campaign for November's election.</p>

<p>"I love the fact that he came back... He said he'd come back to finish his speech, and to me (that takes) guts," said Robert Dupain, 53, a local construction worker who was at the July rally.</p>

<p>"That's what (these) 50,000 people stand for," said Dupain, who described having "nervous excitement all week" about attending.</p>

<p>Though there was no official count, Saturday's rally was significantly better attended than the previous one.</p>

<p>Trump's return to Butler, a deeply conservative community in the key swing state of Pennsylvania, was marked by noticeably tighter security.</p>

<p>"As I was saying," Trump said to laughter from behind bulletproof glass as he began his speech, riffing on the violent interruption to his July monologue.</p>

<p>The same chart towards which Trump turned his head at the moment the would-be assassin open fired three months ago was also flashed up on a big screen Saturday, to cheers.</p>

<p>In a typically meandering speech, Trump repeated lies about immigration, transgender athletes and his political opponents.</p>

<p>The would-be assassin had fired from a complex of buildings left outside the security perimeter, despite its proximity to Trump's podium. It was ringed by state police on Saturday.</p>

<p>Trucks were also parked around the venue, blocking potential sightlines.</p>

<p>'Unnerving'</p>

<p>"There's a lot going on that's unnerving," said Heather Hughes, 43, who had traveled from New Castle in Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>"Do I think he's safe? No, I think there's going to be another attempt. But I think he's going to make it through."</p>

<p>Trump on Saturday suggested his opponents had "maybe even tried to kill me."</p>

<p>The gunman in July was quickly shot dead by a countersniper, but not before he killed rallygoer Corey Comperatore, a firefighter, and wounded two others.</p>

<p>The sound of a bell ringing four times was played at the beginning of Trump's speech, once for each victim including the former president.</p>

<p>An artist created a memorial of Comperatore, complete with his firefighter's helmet, while a singer performed a song about the shooting.</p>

<p>The July attempt, and a September incident at Trump's golf course in Florida that the FBI said was another attempted assassination, raised fears the campaign and the November vote could be marred by more violence.</p>

<p>Retiree Glen Scheirer, who along with five relatives were wearing identical "By the grace of God" T-shirts, described the 20-year-old gunman as "mentally ill," but suggested he could have been influenced by rhetoric calling Trump a threat to democracy.</p>

<p>'Fight, fight, fight'</p>

<p>The crowd chanted Comperatore's name when the mayor of nearby Slippery Rock, Jondavid Longo, paid tribute to the victims of July 13.</p>

<p>"We're glad to welcome president Trump back to Butler," he said.</p>

<p>"His return is not just political -- it signifies our refusal to be defined by tragedy."</p>

<p>James Sweetland, a doctor who ran to Comperatore in the wake of the shooting, told the crowd that "an assassin's bullet should not decide our election."</p>

<p>He was called on once again Saturday when a rallygoer was taken ill in the grandstand alongside the stage.</p>

<p>Sally Sherry, a first responder at Butler Memorial Hospital who treated Trump, said he was not the hard character "like you see on TV."</p>

<p>"I wasn't supposed to make it," Trump reflected. "I'm a little bit embarrassed to say it, but fight, fight, fight!"</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Israeli airstrikes hit southern Beirut late Saturday night, with Lebanese media reporting particularly violent strikes lasting into early Sunday morning.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="CetSht_cn">
<ol class="CetSht_ol">
	<li class="CetSht_li">Explosions were heard for over two hours across southern Beirut, with news agency AFP reporting balls of flame and plumes of smoke rising from the targeted sites. In one particularly severe strike, thick smoke filled the air, and flares lit up the night sky for almost an hour. Residents fled the scene in panic, some on foot, others on motorbikes, as explosions echoed in the background.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed the operation, claiming on their Telegram channel that they were targeting Hezbollah's infrastructure. The strikes came after an earlier call by the Israeli army for residents of southern Beirut to evacuate, warning civilians to move at least 500 meters away from designated buildings.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">This latest escalation comes amid ongoing hostilities between Hezbollah and Israel. The two sides have exchanged fire nearly daily over the past year, following the outbreak of the Gaza war.&nbsp;</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Since September 23, Israel has launched a series of airstrikes in Lebanon, killing over 1,110 people and displacing over a million. Just last week, Israeli forces killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in an airstrike on southern Beirut.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">A high-ranking Hezbollah source told news agency AFP that communication had been lost with Hashem Safieddine, a senior Hezbollah figure expected to succeed Nasrallah, following Israeli airstrikes earlier in the week.&nbsp;</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">While Hezbollah has not officially confirmed the loss of contact, two sources close to the organisation said attempts to reach Safieddine were being impeded by continued Israeli bombardments. It was reported that Safieddine had been with Hezbollah's head of intelligence, Hajj Murtada, at the time of the attack.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">The recent strikes are among the most significant in Israel's campaign against Hezbollah, with 11 consecutive airstrikes on Hezbollah strongholds in southern Beirut recorded early Friday. Israel's military claimed to have hit Hezbollah's intelligence headquarters in Beirut during these attacks.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">In addition to the escalating conflict in Lebanon, Israel is preparing for further tensions related to the anniversary of the Hamas attack on October 7. The Israeli military has increased forces and heightened alert, anticipating possible retaliatory strikes from Hezbollah or its Iranian backers. Iran has already launched missile attacks in response to Israeli operations.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Since Monday, Israeli forces have reportedly killed 440 Hezbollah fighters in ground and air operations in Lebanon. The strikes aim to neutralise Hezbollah's rocket fire, which has targeted northern Israel for nearly a year, displacing tens of thousands of Israeli civilians.&nbsp;</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">The United States has evacuated 600 citizens from Lebanon since the escalation began, with 145 passengers leaving on flights organised by the US State Department on Saturday alone.</li>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Massive consecutive strikes hit Beirut's southern suburbs from late Saturday into Sunday, Reuters eyewitnesses said, sending booms across the city and sparking flashes of red and white for nearly 30 minutes visible from several kilometers away.</p>

<p>The strikes came after days of bombing by Israel of Beirut suburbs considered strongholds for Iran-backed armed group Hezbollah, killing its leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, and possibly his potential successor.</p>

<p>A Lebanese security source said on Saturday that Hashem Safieddine, the potential successor, had been out of contact since Friday, after an Israeli airstrike near the city's international airport that was reported to have targeted him.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said it eliminated Nasrallah in a strike on the group's central command headquarters in Beirut on Sept. 27. Hezbollah confirmed he had been killed.</p>

<p>Lebanese security sources said Israeli strikes since Friday on Dahiyeh, a residential area and Hezbollah stronghold south of central Beirut, have kept rescue workers from scouring the site of Thursday night's attack.</p>

<p>Hezbollah has made no comment so far on Safieddine.</p>

<p>His loss would be another blow to the group and its patron Iran. Israeli strikes across the region in the past year, sharply accelerated in the past few weeks, have decimated Hezbollah's leadership.</p>

<p>Israel has been expanding its actions in Lebanon. On Saturday, it made its first strike in the northern city of Tripoli, a Lebanese security official said, and Israeli troops launched raids in the south.</p>

<p>At least eight strikes rocked Beirut's southern suburbs late on Saturday including close to the airport, according to Reuters witnesses, after the Israeli military warned some residents to flee.</p>

<p>Before the recent upsurge, exchanges of fire between Israel and Hezbollah had been mostly limited to the Israel-Lebanon border area, in parallel to Israel's year-old war in Gaza against Palestinian group Hamas.</p>

<p>Israeli military spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said on Saturday that Israel had killed 440 Hezbollah fighters in its ground operations in southern Lebanon and destroyed 2,000 Hezbollah targets. Hezbollah has not released death tolls.</p>

<p>Israel says it stepped up its assault on Hezbollah to enable the safe return of tens of thousands of citizens to homes in northern Israel, bombarded by the group since last Oct. 8.</p>

<p>Israeli authorities said on Saturday that nine Israeli soldiers had been killed in southern Lebanon so far.</p>

<p><strong>Civilian Deaths, Displacement</strong></p>

<p>The Israeli assault has also killed hundreds of ordinary Lebanese, Lebanese officials say, and forced 1.2 million people - almost a quarter of the population - from their homes.</p>

<p>The Lebanese security official told Reuters that Saturday's strike on a Palestinian refugee camp in Tripoli killed a member of Hamas, his wife and two children. Media affiliated with the Palestinian group said the strike killed a leader of its armed wing, naming him as Saeed Atallah.</p>

<p>The Israeli said in a statement that it had killed two Hamas members operating in Lebanon, but did not say whether they had been in Tripoli, a Sunni Muslim-majority port city also targeted during a 2006 war with Hezbollah.</p>

<p>There was no immediate comment from Hamas.</p>

<p>In northern Israel, air raid sirens on Saturday sent people running for shelters amid rocket fire from Lebanon.</p>

<p>Hezbollah said it had fired missiles at what it called "ATA company for military industries near Sakhnin base," close to Haifa. It was not immediately clear what Hezbollah was referring to.</p>

<p>The Israeli army said two projectiles had crossed from Lebanon, one of which was intercepted while the other landed but caused no damage.</p>

<p><strong>Anniversary Of October 7</strong></p>

<p>The violence came as the anniversary approached of Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel, in which 1,200 people were killed and about 250 taken hostage, according to Israeli tallies.</p>

<p>Israel's subsequent assault on Gaza has killed nearly 42,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's health ministry, and displaced nearly all of the enclave's population of 2.3 million.</p>

<p>The impact on civilians has prompted widespread protests internationally. Thousands of demonstrators took to the streets in major cities around the world on Saturday as the anniversary approached.</p>

<p>Iran, which backs both Hezbollah and Hamas, and which has lost key commanders of its elite Revolutionary Guards Corps to Israeli airstrikes this year, launched ballistic missiles at Israel on Tuesday. The strikes did little damage.</p>

<p>Israel has been weighing options for its response.</p>

<p>Oil prices have risen on the possibility of an Israeli attack on Iranian oil facilities. U.S. President Joe Biden on Friday urged Israel to consider alternatives to striking Iranian oil infrastructure.</p>

<p>The top U.S. general for the region, Army General Michael "Eric" Kurilla, is traveling in the Middle East, a U.S. defense official said on Saturday, declining to specify which country or to confirm Israeli media reports that he had arrived in Israel for consultations with Israeli military officials.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A burglar broke into a woman's home in the UK and decided to feel at home and finish several household chores including cooking, cleaning and hanging out washed clothes. He left the house with a note, “Don't worry, be happy, eat up and scratch.”</p>

<p>Damian Wojnilowicz, 36, conducted an unusual burglary in Monmouthshire on July 16. Cardiff Crown Court sentenced him to 22 months of jail on Thursday, reported <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czeg6xk6rkko">BBC</a>.</p>

<p>This left the victim too scared to stay in her home. “Two weeks after the crime until he was caught, I was living in a state of heightened anxiety I had never experienced before,” said the woman in a personal statement. “I wondered if it was somebody who knew me, if it was going to turn into a stalking incident, if he knew I lived alone and if I had been targeted,” she added.</p>

<p>“I was too scared to stay in my own home and stayed with a friend.”</p>

<p><strong>Burglar's To-Do</strong></p>

<p>Damian Wojnilowicz unpacked a pair of shoes and discarded the packaging in the recycling bin. Similarly, he replaced toothbrush heads and kitchen utensils.</p>

<p>Wojnilowicz took grocery shopping out of bags and put them in the refrigerator. He went on to rearrange the fridge. He also refilled bird feeders, removed plant pots, moped the floor and kept an empty bottle of wine in a rack.</p>

<p>Before leaving, Wojnilowicz cooked a meal using ingredients from the woman's cupboard.</p>

<p>When the woman returned home, she saw a bottle of red wine had been left out, next to a glass and bottle opener, and a bowl of sweets was lying on the living room table.</p>

<p>She spoke to her neighbour who described seeing someone hanging out washing.</p>

<p><strong>Burglar Gets Caught</strong></p>

<p>Wojnilowicz carried out a second burglary at another home on July 29, following which he was arrested. He was caught when the homeowner received a CCTV alert on his phone which showed Wojnilowicz walking on his driveway.</p>

<p>This time he used the shower in a summerhouse to wash and clean his clothes. He consumed food and drink and left the hot tub dirty.</p>

<p>When the homeowner asked his son-in-law to attend to the property, Wojnilowicz was found holding a glass and appeared to be drunk. He left the house upon asking.</p>

<p>The homeowner said he felt "sick, horrified, and useless" when he became aware of the burglary, reported <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czeg6xk6rkko">BBC</a>.</p>

<p>Wojnilowicz was homeless and was undergoing several difficulties during that time, said Tabitha Walker, the defendant.</p>

<p>Sentencing, Recorder Christian Jowett said: "This was a significant intrusion in their homes."</p>

<p>The court heard he has four previous convictions for offences including common assault, public order offences, and failing to surrender.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA["I think that today, the priority is that we return to a political solution, that we stop delivering weapons to fight in Gaza," Emmanuel Macron told French broadcaster France Inter.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>French President Emmanuel Macron called Saturday for a halt on arms deliveries to Israel for use in Gaza, provoking a sharp response from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.</p>

<p>Macron also criticised Netanyahu's decision to send troops into ground operations in Lebanon.</p>

<p>"I think that today, the priority is that we return to a political solution, that we stop delivering weapons to fight in Gaza," Macron told French broadcaster France Inter.</p>

<p>"France is not delivering any," he added during the interview, which was recorded Tuesday.</p>

<p>Macron reiterated his concern over the conflict in Gaza that is continuing despite repeated calls for a ceasefire.</p>

<p>"I think we are not being heard," he said. "I think it is a mistake, including for the security of Israel," he said, adding that the war was leading to "hatred".</p>

<p>His comments brought a swift response from Netanyahu.</p>

<p>"As Israel fights the forces of barbarism led by Iran, all civilised countries should be standing firmly by Israel's side," Netanyahu said in a statement issued by his office.</p>

<p>"Yet, President Macron and other Western leaders are now calling for arms embargoes against Israel. Shame on them."</p>

<p>Israel was fighting a war on several fronts against groups backed by arch-foe Iran, the statement added.</p>

<p>Macron' office responded with a statement of its own later Saturday.</p>

<p>France is a "steadfast friend of Israel", it said, describing Netanyahu's reaction as "excessive and detached from the friendship between France and Israel".</p>

<p>Qatar, a key mediator in Gaza ceasefire talks, said Macron's statement was "an important and appreciated step towards stopping the war".</p>

<p>Jordan welcomed the French leader's remarks and stressed "the importance of imposing a complete ban on the export of weapons to Israel" and "real consequences" for the country's actions.</p>

<p><strong>Ceasefire call</strong></p>

<p>In his interview, Macron also said avoiding an escalation in Lebanon was a "priority."</p>

<p>"Lebanon cannot become a new Gaza," he added.</p>

<p>And he returned to the subject Saturday in a speech to a conference of French-speaking nations in Paris.</p>

<p>While both Paris and Washington had called for a ceasefire, said Macron, "I regret that Prime Minister Netanyahu has made another choice, has taken this responsibility, in particular, for ground operations on Lebanese soil."</p>

<p>The 88 members of the International Organisation of La Francophonie (OIF), including France and Canada, have called for an "immediate and lasting" ceasefire in Lebanon, he added.</p>

<p>But Macron reaffirmed Israel's right to self-defence and said that on Monday he would be meeting relatives of Franco-Israelis held hostage in Gaza.</p>

<p>On Monday, Israel marks the first anniversary of the October 7 Hamas attack that sparked the Gaza war and has now engulfed neighbouring Lebanon, creating a perilous regional crisis.</p>

<p>The attack resulted in the deaths of 1,205 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures that include hostages killed in captivity.

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The UN secretary-general denounced Hamas and called for an immediate end to the "shocking violence and bloodshed" in Gaza and Lebanon in a statement Saturday ahead of the anniversary of the Palestinian group's October 7 attack.</p>

<p>Monday marks one year since the devastating assault on Israel that sparked the ongoing war in Gaza, with Lebanon now also pulled into the fray and world leaders warning of a potential all-out regional crisis.</p>

<p>"This is a day for the global community to repeat in the loudest voice our utter condemnation of the abhorrent acts of Hamas, including the taking of hostages," UN chief Antonio Guterres said in an anniversary message released Saturday evening.</p>

<p>While demanding the hostages' "immediate and unconditional release," Guterres also implored Hamas to allow the hostages to be visited by Red Cross personnel.</p>

<p>Hamas militants abducted 251 people on October 7, 97 of whom are still captive in Gaza, including 33 the Israeli military has said are dead.</p>

<p>Guterres additionally voiced concern over the conflict spreading to Lebanon, where Israel in recent days has pounded the Hamas-allied group Hezbollah, killing over a thousand people and forcing more than a million to flee their homes.</p>

<p>"The war that has followed the terrible attacks of one year ago continues to shatter lives and inflict profound human suffering for Palestinians in Gaza, and now the people of Lebanon," Guterres said.</p>

<p>The October 7 attack on Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,205 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures that include hostages killed in captivity.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory offensive on Gaza has so far killed at least 41,825 people, a majority of them civilians, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run Palestinian territory. The UN has said those figures are reliable.</p>

<p>"Since October 7th, a wave of shocking violence and bloodshed has erupted," said Guterres.</p>

<p>"It is time for the release of the hostages," he said. "Time to silence the guns. Time to stop the suffering that has engulfed the region. Time for peace, international law and justice."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump on Saturday returned to the venue of a campaign rally where he was nearly assassinated in July, calling his would-be assassin a "vicious monster". He also invited billionaire <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/elon-musks-x-pays-5-2-million-brazil-fines-but-to-wrong-account-6719495" target="_blank">Elon Musk</a> on stage in Pennsylvania's Butler, saying that he is an "incredible guy".</p>

<p>"As I was saying," Trump said as he started speaking behind bulletproof glass, pretending he was resuming the speech that was interrupted when he was grazed in the ear by a bullet on July 13.</p>

<p>"Exactly 12 weeks ago this evening, on this very ground, a cold-blooded assassin aimed to silence me," he told thousands of his supporters.</p>

He was subsequently shot and killed by a Secret Service agent.</p>

<p>As blood dripped down his face, Trump raised a fist and shouted "fight, fight, fight" to his supporters, an image that had gone viral on social media.</p>

<p>During the Saturday rally, Musk praised Trump and took a dig at US President Joe Biden.</p>

<p>"We had one president who couldn't climb a flight of stairs and another who is fist pumping after getting shot," he said.</p>

<p>It was the first time Musk, the owner of social media platform X, attended a Trump poll rally since he endorsed him on July 13.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thousands of protesters marched in cities around the world on Saturday calling for a ceasefire in Gaza and Lebanon as the war in the Palestinian territory neared the one-year mark.</p>

<p>Kicking off a planned wave of demonstrations worldwide, pro-Palestinian supporters gathered in cities in Europe, Africa and the Americas to demand an end to the conflict, which has killed nearly 42,000 people in Gaza.</p>

<p>Dozens of protests and commemorations are set to take place ahead of the anniversary Monday of Hamas's attack on Israel, which resulted in the deaths of 1,205 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory military offensive has killed at least 41,825 people in Gaza, most of them civilians, according to figures provided by the territory's health ministry and described as reliable by the United Nations.</p>

<p>With Israel now mounting a ground operation in Lebanon and vowing to respond to a barrage of missiles fired by Iran this week, there are fears the conflict could spiral into a wider war.</p>

<p>Underlining international polarisation over events in the Middle East, demonstrations in support of both Israel and the Palestinians are planned worldwide -- sometimes with rival events scheduled in the same city.</p>

<p><strong>'Worse and worse'</strong></p>

<p>A pro-Palestinian protest in Rome that drew thousands of people turned violent, as dozens of young demonstrators threw bottles and firecrackers at police, who responded with tear gas and water cannon.</p>

<p>At least one policeman was wounded and two protestors detained, AFP journalists said.</p>

<p>"Israel is a criminal state!" the demonstrators shouted.</p>

<p>In Berlin, police said they had detained 26 people who shouted insults at a pro-Israeli commemoration attended by around 650 people.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, a pro-Palestinian demonstration drew just over 1,000 protestors in the German capital, police said.</p>

<p>At the "National March for Palestine" in London, chants of "stop bombing civilians" were joined by shouts of "hands off Lebanon".</p>

<p>Zackerea Bakir, 28, said he has attended dozens of marches around the United Kingdom. Large numbers continue to turn up because "everyone wants a change", he told AFP.</p>

<p>"It's continuing to just get worse and worse, and yet nothing seems to be changing," said Bakir, joined at the rally by his mother and brother.</p>

<p>While the rally in London was largely peaceful, at least 15 people were arrested, including three on suspicion of assaulting an emergency worker and one on suspicion of supporting a proscribed organisation.</p>

<p>In Dublin, several hundred people took to the streets, waving Palestinian flags and chanting: "Ceasefire now!".</p>

<p>In France, thousands of people marched in Paris, Lyon, Toulouse, Bordeaux and Strasbourg to express solidarity with Palestinians, AFP journalists said.</p>

<p>Around 5,000 people joined a pro-Palestinian protest in Madrid, brandishing signs with messages such as "Boycott Israel".</p>

<p>A pro-Palestinian demonstration in the Swiss city of Basel drew several thousand people, the Keystone-ATS news agency reported.</p>

<p>Hundreds of pro-Palestinian demonstrators also marched on the Israeli embassy in Athens, which was heavily guarded by riot police.</p>

<p><strong>Soaring tension</strong></p>

<p>In Cape Town in South Africa, hundreds walked to parliament, chanting: "Israel is a racist state" and "We are all Palestinian."</p>

<p>Pro-Gaza marches were also planned Saturday in Johannesburg and Durban.</p>

<p>In Caracas, hundreds of pro-Palestinian demonstrators protested outside the United Nations's headquarters for Venezuela, carrying a giant Palestinian flag.</p>

<p>They delivered a petition to the UN calling for an end to the "genocide" of the Palestinians.</p>

<p>"Where are the UN peacekeepers? Why haven't they intervened?" university professor Jesus Reyes, 53, told AFP.</p>

<p>Other pro-Palestinian protests were planned over the weekend and on Monday in cities including New York, Sydney, Buenos Aires, Madrid, Manila, and Karachi.</p>

<p>Commemorations for victims of the October 7 attack are also scheduled internationally, including ceremonies in London, Washington, Paris and Geneva.</p>

<p>Pope Francis has called for a day of "prayer and fasting for peace" on the anniversary of the attack, amid soaring tension in the Middle East.</p>

<p>An official anniversary ceremony will be held in Jerusalem on Monday.</p>

<p>Israeli President Isaac Herzog will lead a memorial service at Sderot, one of the cities hardest hit during the onslaught by Palestinian militants.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A group of highly skilled Chinese hackers linked to the Chinese government successfully infiltrated multiple US telecommunications firms in the last few months, CNN reported.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A group of highly skilled Chinese hackers linked to the Chinese government successfully infiltrated multiple US telecommunications firms in the last few months, CNN <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/10/05/politics/chinese-hackers-us-telecoms/index.html?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=whatsappCNN&amp;utm_content=2024-10-05T23:51:39" title="n">reported</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to CNN, US investigators believe the hackers may have gained access to wiretap warrant requests, although the extent of the damage and what exact information was compromised remains under investigation. The hackers targeted major broadband and internet providers, including AT&amp;T, Verizon, and Lumen, all critical players in the US telecom industry.</p>

<p>This newly discovered cyber-espionage campaign has prompted grave concerns among US officials about the potential national security risks posed by the hackers' success. The breach represents yet another sophisticated attack attributed to Chinese cyber operatives, coinciding with heightened tensions between Washington and Beijing over cyber espionage and broader security issues.</p>

<p>The US telecommunications industry forms the backbone of the country's internet and phone communications, making it a prime target for any state-sponsored hackers. Telecom firms possess vast amounts of caller and user data, and law enforcement agencies often seek access to specific portions of this data as part of national security investigations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Both AT&amp;T and Lumen declined to comment on the ongoing investigation, while Verizon did not respond to CNN's multiple requests for a statement. US agencies involved in the investigation, such as the Department of Justice and the FBI, have also remained tight-lipped, refusing to provide any official comment.</p>

<p>The Chinese Embassy in Washington DC denied any involvement by Beijing-backed hackers in the breach. Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson for the embassy, labelled the accusations as a "distortion of the fact" and accused the US of politicising cybersecurity issues to "smear China."</p>

<p>The US Congress has been briefed on the severity of the situation, CNN reported, with both the House and Senate intelligence committees receiving updates on the hacking campaign. Major cybersecurity players, such as Microsoft and Mandiant, have also been brought in to assist in probing the attacks. Sources close to the investigation have highlighted the persistence and sophistication of the hacking group, known in cybersecurity circles as Salt Typhoon.</p>

<p>FBI Director Christopher Wray has even remarked that Chinese government-backed hackers vastly outnumber FBI cyber personnel by a staggering 50 to 1.</p>

<p>One such Chinese hacking group has allegedly been lurking in US transportation and communication networks, ready to disrupt any US response in the event of a Chinese military invasion of Taiwan.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another notable Chinese hacking operation occurred last year when hackers breached the unclassified email accounts of senior US diplomats just before Secretary of State Antony Blinken's high-profile visit to China.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel placed its forces on alert Saturday ahead of the anniversary of Hamas's October 7 attack, after a military official said the country was preparing its retaliation for Iran's missile attack.</p>

<p>The alert came with Israel engaged in an intensifying war with the Lebanese Hezbollah group, which army chief Lieutenant General Herzi Halevi said would be hit "without concession or respite".</p>

<p>Ahead of Monday's grim anniversary, military spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said at a televised briefing: "We are prepared with increased forces in anticipation for this day", when there could be "attacks on the home front".</p>

<p>The unprecedented October 7 attack on Israel by the Palestinian group resulted in the deaths of 1,205 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures that include hostages killed in captivity.</p>

<p>One year later, although the war in Gaza continues at a lower tempo, Israel has turned its focus north to Lebanon, where it is now at war with Hezbollah, and is focused on the movement's backer Iran.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said it had killed around 440 Hezbollah fighters "from the ground and from the air" since Monday when troops began "targeted" ground operations against Hezbollah in Lebanon.</p>

<p>Israel says it aims to allow tens of thousands of Israelis displaced by almost a year of Hezbollah rocket fire into northern Israel to return home.</p>

<p>Israel's President Isaac Herzog called Iran an "ongoing threat" after Tehran, which backs armed groups across the Middle East, on Tuesday launched around 200 missiles at Israel in revenge for Israeli killings of top militant leaders.</p>

<p><strong>'Duty' to respond</strong></p>

<p>The missile attack killed one person in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and damaged an Israeli air base, according to satellite images.</p>

<p>It the same day Israeli ground forces began their raids into Lebanon after days of intense strikes on Hezbollah strongholds across Lebanon.</p>

<p>One Israeli military official, speaking to AFP on condition of anonymity as he was not authorised to discuss the issue publicly, said the army "is preparing a response" to Iran's attack.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in a statement, noted Iran had twice launched "hundreds of missiles" at Israeli territory since April.</p>

<p>"Israel has the duty and the right to defend itself and to respond to these attacks and that is what we will do," said Netanyahu. His critics accuse him of obstructing efforts to reach a Gaza ceasefire and deal to free hostages still held by Hamas.</p>

<p>A senior Hezbollah source said Saturday the group had lost contact with Hashem Safieddine, widely tipped to be the next Hezbollah leader, after air strikes this week in Beirut.</p>

<p>The movement is yet to name a new chief after Israel assassinated Hassan Nasrallah late last month in a massive strike in the Lebanese capital.</p>

<p>Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Friday said that "the resistance in the region will not back down".</p>

<p><strong>Fresh strikes on Hamas</strong></p>

<p>Hezbollah said its fighters were confronting Israeli troops in Lebanon's southern border region, and early Sunday claimed to have repelled an attempted Israeli incursion into a border village.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said Saturday it had struck militants inside a mosque in Bint Jbeil. It also reported frequent rocket fire from Lebanon while Hezbollah claimed a rocket attack on northern Israel's Ramat David air base, and on a "military industries company" near Israel's coastal city of Acre.</p>

<p>Hamas said Israeli strikes had killed two of its operatives in north and east Lebanon Saturday, as Israel's military confirmed the killing of two Hamas figures.</p>

<p>Hamas said one of them was hit near Tripoli, the first such strike in the northern area.</p>

<p>Netanyahu said Israel had "destroyed a large part" of Hezbollah's arsenal and "changed the course of the war".</p>

<p>In a March report, the Center for Strategic and International Studies said estimates of Hezbollah's rockets and missiles varied from 120,000-200,000.</p>

<p><strong>'Never-ending'</strong></p>

<p>On central Beirut's busy Hamra Street, Salma Salman said she had been camping out with her seven-year-old twin daughters for nearly two weeks.</p>

<p>"We're living a terrifying, never-ending nightmare," she said.</p>

<p>Late Saturday Israel issued a new appeal for residents of southern Beirut, a Hezbollah stronghold, to evacuate.</p>

<p>A little later, official Lebanese media said five Israeli strikes hit south Beirut and its outskirts, four of them "very violent".</p>

<p>AFP correspondents in Beirut heard several explosions and saw smoke rising south of Beirut.</p>

<p>Across Lebanon, the wave of strikes on Hezbollah strongholds has killed more than 1,110 people since September 23, according to a tally based on official figures.</p>

<p>The head of the UN's refugee agency, Filippo Grandi, said in Lebanon that the country "faces a terrible crisis" and warned "hundreds of thousands of people are left destitute or displaced by Israeli air strikes".</p>

<p>Israeli bombardment has put at least four hospitals in Lebanon out of service, the facilities said.</p>

<p>British foreign minister David Lammy described reports of the strikes "deeply disturbing" in a post on X.</p>

<p>The UN peacekeeping force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) said it rejected a request by the Israeli military to "relocate some of our positions" in south Lebanon.</p>

<p>Ireland's President Michael Higgins, whose country has peacekeepers in the mission, said Israel was "demanding that the entire UNIFIL... walk away", which he called "an insult to the most important global institution".</p>

<p>Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, visiting Damascus on Saturday after a stop in Beirut, renewed his call for ceasefires in both Gaza and Lebanon, while threatening Israel with an "even stronger" reaction to any attack on Iran.</p>

<p>French President Emmanuel Macron said it was time "that we stop delivering weapons to fight in Gaza," adding that France was not providing any.</p>

<p>He also criticised Israel's decision to send ground troops into Lebanon.</p>

<p><strong>Unhealed wounds</strong></p>

<p>US, Qatari and Egyptian mediators tried unsuccessfully for months to reach a Gaza truce and secure the release of 97 hostages still held in the Hamas-ruled territory.</p>

<p>Medics and rescuers said Israeli fire early Saturday killed at least 12 people across Gaza.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory military offensive has killed at least 41,825 people in Gaza, the majority of them civilians, according to figures provided by the territory's health ministry and described as reliable by the UN.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>New Zealand said Sunday it had rescued all 75 sailors from a navy vessel that ran aground and sank off Samoa while conducting a reef survey.</p>

<p>Emergency services worked through the night to rescue dozens of crew from the smouldering and sinking HMNZS Manawanui after it struck the reef off the south coast of Upolu.</p>

<p>Samoan emergency services said a fire rescue team worked "from last night until this morning" to collect and treat the 75 crew members.</p>

<p>"Fortunately, no one was heavily injured and no lives were lost," Samoa Fire and Emergency Services Authority said.</p>

<p>New Zealand Commodore Shane Arndell confirmed that "the 75 crew and passengers on board HMNZS Manawanui have made it to safety in Samoa".</p>

<p>The exact cause of the wreck is not yet known.</p>

<p>The HMNZS Manawanui was used for hydrographic surveys, diving operations and marine salvage and featured a 100-tonne sea crane.</p>

<p>It had been conducting a hydrographic survey one nautical mile from shore in difficult conditions.</p>

<p>Samoan authorities had issued a marine warning for the island's south coast over the weekend.</p>

<p>Winds of up to 40 kilometres (25 miles) per hour and ocean swells of up to four metres (13 feet) were forecast around the time of the incident.</p>

<p>The New Zealand military said rescuers had battled currents and winds that pushed the life rafts and sea boats toward the reefs and "swells made the rescue effort particularly challenging."</p>

<p>The military said it was trying to "understand the implications and minimise the environmental impacts" of the wreckage.</p>

<p>The 85-metre-long ship was built in 2003 and purchased from Norway in 2019.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tehran's top diplomat in Damascus on Saturday threatened an "even stronger" reaction to any aggression, as Israel readied its response to an Iranian missile attack earlier this week.</p>

<p>"Our reaction to any attack by the Zionist regime is completely clear," Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told reporters in the Syrian capital, where he met top officials including Tehran's ally President Bashar al-Assad.</p>

<p>"For every action, there will be a proportional and similar reaction from Iran, and even stronger," he said.</p>

<p>He spoke after an Israeli military official told AFP on condition of anonymity, as he was not authorised to discuss the issue publicly, the army was "preparing a response to the unprecedented and unlawful Iranian attack".</p>

<p>In Damascus earlier, Araghchi renewed his call for ceasefires in the Gaza Strip and in Lebanon.</p>

<p>Araghchi's visit, his first since he took office in August, comes almost a year after Iran-backed Palestinian militant group Hamas attacked Israel, triggering the war in Gaza.</p>

<p>The conflict has also drawn in Iran's Lebanese ally Hezbollah, and on September 23 Israel sharply intensified its campaign against the militant group.</p>

<p>"The most important issue today is the ceasefire, especially in Lebanon and in Gaza," Araghchi said.</p>

<p>"There are initiatives in this regard. There have been consultations that we hope will be successful."</p>

<p>His meetings in Damascus follow a visit to Beirut on Friday during which he voiced support for a truce in Lebanon acceptable to Hezbollah, "simultaneously with a ceasefire in Gaza".</p>

<p>He travelled to Syria's capital by air after Lebanon said an Israeli air strike on Friday severed the main international highway linking the two countries.</p>

<p>Israel said the strike aimed to prevent the flow of weapons to Hezbollah from neighbouring Syria.</p>

<p>Iran has been a staunch ally of Assad throughout the civil war that erupted in 2011 following the suppression of anti-government protests.</p>

<p>Earlier on Saturday, Assad's office quoted him as saying Iran's missile attack on Israel was "a strong response and taught the Zionist entity a lesson".</p>

<p>The attack came just days after an Israeli air strike in southern Beirut killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sydney has been named the world's best city in a survey conducted by <em>Conde Nast Traveller</em>. The top-10 global cities rankings are part of the publication's annual Readers' Choice Awards for 2024, which launched on October 1 in the UK. Sydney, which ranked no. 1 with a score of 92.26, was praised by the Conde Nast Traveller UK for its "unique, indoor-outdoor way of life". Sydney beat out tourism hotspots spanning five continents, including Valencia in Spain (92.78), Singapore (92.47), Hong Kong (91.72) and Stockholm, Sweden (91.11), which ranked second to fifth place respectively.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/10/05/world-news/sydney-ranked-as-best-city-in-the-world-second-behind-singapore-in-friendliest-in-new-list/" rel="noindex, nofollow"><em>New York Post</em></a>, Sydney was also named the world's second-most friendly city, with a score of 93.85, behind Singapore, with 94.84 points, while Sydney hotel The Fullerton was crowned the best hotel in Australasia.</p>

<p>Conde Nast Traveler US also unveiled its Readers' Choice Awards this week, with Sydney placing third in the US awards list of the best cities in the world, describing it as "an ideal getaway no matter the season". Australian hotel Ritz-Carlton Melbourne was named the best hotel in Australia and New Zealand for 2024.</p>

<p>The UK and US Readers' Choice Awards winners were chosen based on the votes of more than half a million survey respondents, the <em>Post </em>reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"If you've experienced a snippet of life Down Under, you've probably fallen hard for the unique, indoor-outdoor way of life the Aussies embrace so well," Traveller said about Sydney.</p>

<p>Moreover, the publication also had readers vote on their favourite airlines with Air New Zealand coming first, followed by Singapore Airlines, Qatar Airways, Emirates and British Airways.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in September, Sydney was also named Oceania's Leading City Destination in the World Travel Awards 2024.</p>

<p>With results like that, you'd think Sydney was in the midst of an international tourism boom. However, according to the Post, the reality is somewhat different. According to the most recent International Visitor Survey data from Tourism Research Australia, Sydney welcomed only 3,446,000 foreign visitors in June, a figure still 16 per cent below the same period in 2019.</p>

<p>But John O'Sullivan, chief executive of Experience Co and former Tourism Australia managing director, told the Sydney Morning Herald, that the stellar awards results could go a long way to putting Sydney on the radar of high-value international travellers - that is, those likely to spend more, stay longer and travel further within Australia.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Climate activist Greta Thunberg was among dozens of protesters detained Saturday for blocking a road in the Belgian capital at a demonstration against fossil fuel subsidies.</p>

<p>An AFP journalist saw the iconic Swede -- who has previously been detained for civil disobedience at protests in various countries -- carried away by police after refusing to leave a sit-in.</p>

<p>Thunberg, 21, was part of a smaller group of demonstrators who broke away from a march organised by the United for Climate Justice movement that began outside the European Parliament.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The rally was calling for the European Union -- headquartered in Brussels -- to end subsidies for fossil fuels to achieve its ambitious goal of making the continent carbon neutral by 2050.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"This will not happen without an immediate phase-out of fossil fuel subsidies," climate activists, scientists and economists wrote in an open letter to EU leaders.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Until these necessary changes occur, people will continue to take to the streets to make our voices heard and hold you accountable."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[India made up 29% of international students, but China was still a major source, constituting about one-fourth of international students.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The American Dream has always attracted students from developing nations and Chinese students have always dominated the international student population in US universities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, recent statistics indicate a significant shift in this trend. According to the US State Department and the Institute of International Education, Indian students have surpassed Chinese students as the largest group of international students in American higher education - for the first time since 2009.</p>

<p>India made up 29% of international students, but China was still a major source, constituting about one-fourth of international students.</p>

<p>It is worthwhile to note that 40% of Indians are under 25 which is promising for the country's economy as compared to China, where the population has just begun to age.</p>

<p>According to a report by <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/20/us/china-international-students-us-decline-hnk-dst/index.html" rel="noindex,nofollow">CNN</a>, experts attribute this decline to significant shifts in both policy and public perception. Many Chinese students and families are concerned about safety, racism, and discrimination in the US. The COVID-19 pandemic has also exacerbated these concerns, with a rise in anti-Asian hate crimes and racism.</p>

<p>The downward spiral in US-China relations has also contributed to the decline. The Trump administration's policies, including the cancellation of the Fulbright exchange program with China and the introduction of a ban on graduate science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) students from several Chinese universities, have made it difficult for Chinese students to secure visas.</p>

<p>The decline in Chinese students in the US doesn't necessarily mean there's less appetite for an overseas education. Instead, students and parents are exploring alternative options. Countries like Canada, the UK, and Australia have introduced more immigration-friendly policies, making them attractive alternatives to the US.</p>

<p>India's growing population and increasing demand for higher education have contributed to the surge in Indian students in the US. With over 331,600 Indian students in the US last academic year, India has become the largest source of international students in American higher education.</p>

<p>The allure of an American education may be wearing off for some Chinese students. With improving educational quality in China and growing concerns about safety and racism in the US, some students are opting to stay in China or explore alternative destinations.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Moscow on Tuesday vowed to retaliate after announcing Ukraine had struck Russian military installations with US-supplied weapons, after President Vladimir Putin had warned Kyiv and the West against the missile attacks.</p>

<p>Moscow and Kyiv have been ratcheting up their deadly aerial broadsides with increasingly sophisticated weapons over recent days, spurring fears the conflict could further escalate.</p>

<p>Ukraine first fired US-made ATACMS missiles at Russia last week after getting the green light from Washington, and the Kremlin retaliated with an experimental hypersonic missile that hit the Ukrainian city of Dnipro.</p>

<p>The Russian defence ministry said Ukraine's new ATACMS strikes -- on 23 November and 25 November -- targeted military installations and an airfield in Russia's western Kursk region, causing some damage to the infrastructure.</p>

<p>"Retaliatory actions are being prepared," it added.</p>

<p>Russian forces launched a record 188 drones at Ukraine overnight in an attack that disrupted energy supplies in the east of the country, Kyiv said Tuesday.</p>

<p><strong>Russia admits 'casualties'</strong></p>

<p>Ukraine's ATACMS strike on the Kursk Vostochny air base wounded two servicemen, Moscow's defence ministry said in a rare admission, while a strike on an air defence battery damaged a radar system and also caused "casualties".</p>

<p>It said three of the five missiles fired in the first strike were shot down, while seven of the eight used in the second were destroyed.</p>

<p>In response to Ukraine's first use of the US-supplied weapon, Moscow on Thursday used its new Oreshnik experimental hypersonic missile, which Putin hinted was capable of carrying a nuclear payload.</p>

<p>He warned Russia could continue using the weapon depending on "the actions of the United States and its satellites" and said Moscow had the right to hit military facilities in countries that allow Ukraine to use their weapons against Russia.</p>

<p>Moscow's comments on the new strike -- and its record drone barrage -- came as ambassadors from Ukraine and NATO's 32 members were due to meet in Brussels over Russia's firing last week of the intermediate-range missile.</p>

<p>The meeting was to come hours after Ukraine's air force said it had shot down 76 Russian drones in 17 regions, while another 95 were either lost from their radars or downed by electronic jamming defensive systems. It did not specify what happened to the remainder.</p>

<p>"These attacks are possible only because of Russia's ability to circumvent sanctions through various schemes," President Volodymyr Zelensky said in response.</p>

<p>"We need greater collective efforts to enforce sanctions and force Russia to stop this war," he said.</p>

<p>AFP journalists heard explosions ring out over the capital during the attack, while in the relatively untouched western Ternopil region, authorities said the drones had damaged a "critical infrastructure facility," without elaborating.</p>

<p>They said the attack had disrupted electricity supplies in the region and that engineers were working to stabilise the situation.</p>

<p>Kyiv had said it hopes to get "concrete and meaningful outcomes" after calling the meeting of the NATO-Ukraine Council.</p>

<p>But diplomats and officials at NATO have played down expectations for any major results from the consultations on Tuesday afternoon at the alliance's Brussels headquarters.</p>

<p>The most that is expected is a reiteration of NATO's earlier insistence that Moscow's deployment of the new weaponry will not "deter NATO allies from supporting Ukraine".</p>

<p><strong>Russian forces advance</strong></p>

<p>The meeting "provides an opportunity to discuss the current security situation in Ukraine and will include briefings from Ukrainian officials via video link," a NATO official said.</p>

<p>The Kremlin dismissed the meeting, saying it was unlikely any significant decisions would be taken.</p>

<p>On the battlefield, Ukraine's fatigued troops are struggling to halt advances by Russian forces in the east of the country.</p>

<p>Russia said Tuesday its troops had captured another village in the Kharkiv region, in an area where the front line had been relatively stable until recently.</p>

<p>Moscow's defence ministry said its units had "liberated" the settlement of Kopanky," a village near the Ukrainian-held city of Kupiansk that was previously captured by Russian forces at the start of the 2022 offensive before being re-taken by Ukraine later that year.</p>

<p>Moscow-appointed officials in the occupied region of Kherson meanwhile said that Ukrainian forces had struck a bus in the Russian-occupied town of Nova Kakhovka on Tuesday, killing four people and wounding at least seven others.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Russia said on Tuesday it was expelling a British diplomat who it accused of espionage and summoned London's ambassador to the foreign ministry in Moscow.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russia said on Tuesday it was expelling a British diplomat who it accused of espionage and summoned London's ambassador to the foreign ministry in Moscow.</p>

<p>The FSB security service said the diplomat appeared to have carried out "intelligence and subversive work, threatening the security of the Russian Federation", state news agencies reported.</p>

<p>The development came hours after Russia confirmed it had arrested a British man captured fighting for Ukraine, amid heightened tensions between Moscow and the West over the state of the conflict, which began nearly three years ago.</p>

<p>The FSB said the diplomat had "deliberately provided false data when obtaining permission to enter our country, thus violating Russian law".</p>

<p>Footage broadcast by state media showed Britain's ambassador arriving at the foreign ministry in central Moscow after being summoned for talks, minutes after the expulsion was announced.</p>

<p>London and Moscow have expelled several of each other's diplomats on spying allegations in recent years.</p>

<p>The FSB said the man expelled on Tuesday was a replacement for one of six British officials that Russia had expelled earlier this year, also on spying accusations.</p>

<p>Relations between the two capitals have been repeatedly strained by alleged spy scandals.</p>

<p>The current wave began with the 2006 assassination of former Russian agent and Kremlin critic Alexander Litvinenko in a London poisoning attack.</p>

<p>Then in 2018, Britain and its allies expelled dozens of Russian embassy officials they accused of being spies over the attempted poisoning of former double agent, Sergei Skripal, who was living in exile in Britain.</p>

<p>Skripal survived the attempted Novichok attack but a British civilian died after touching a contaminated perfume bottle, triggering uproar in London.</p>

<p><strong>British fighter arrested</strong></p>

<p>Also on Tuesday, a court in Russia's western Kursk region confirmed a British citizen accused of fighting for Ukraine had been captured and arrested.</p>

<p>James Scott Rhys Anderson, 22, was ordered remanded in custody on allegations he had "participated in armed hostilities on the territory of the Kursk region".</p>

<p>It was the first official confirmation from Russia of Anderson's arrest, following a video that was published on pro-Kremlin Telegram channels over the weekend.</p>

<p>The video showed a man, who appeared to have his hands tied, identify himself as James Anderson.</p>

<p>In the footage, which could not be verified, the man said he joined the Ukrainian army after being dismissed from the British army in 2023.</p>

<p>UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy said on Monday that London had been "updated about that development" and would "offer this UK national all the support we can".</p>

<p>Without specifying exactly what Anderson had been charged with or how long he had been ordered to remain in custody, the Leninsky court in Kursk said he was suspected of "committing a set of particularly serious offences that post a danger to society".</p>

<p>Russia considers foreigners travelling to fight in Ukraine as "mercenaries", enabling prosecution under its criminal code rather than treating them as prisoners of war under the Geneva Convention.</p>

<p>In 2022, a court in Russian-occupied eastern Ukraine sentenced two British fighters to death for fighting for Ukraine, although they were later released in a prisoner and POW exchange.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[G7 foreign ministers said Tuesday they "will comply with our respective obligations" regarding the arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued by the International Criminal Court (ICC).]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>G7 foreign ministers said Tuesday they "will comply with our respective obligations" regarding the arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued by the International Criminal Court (ICC).</p>

<p>The Group of Seven industrialised nations brings together Britain, Canada, Germany, France, Japan, host Italy and the United States.</p>

<p>"We reiterate our commitment to International Humanitarian Law and will comply with our respective obligations," the ministers said in a joint statement issued following two days of talks near Rome.</p>

<p>The ICC issued an arrest warrant for Netanyahu last week, prompting outrage from Israel and its allies -- including the US, which is not a member of the ICC and has rejected its jurisdiction.</p>

<p>All of the other G7 countries are members of the ICC -- meaning they would have to arrest Netanyahu if he travelled there.</p>

<p>The ICC also issued warrants for Netanyahu's former defence minister and for Hamas's military chief Mohammed Deif, whom Israel claimed was killed in an air strike in Gaza in July. Hamas has not confirmed his death.</p>

<p>The G7 statement said the foreign ministers "underline that there can be no equivalence between the terrorist group Hamas and the State of Israel".</p>

<p>"In exercising its right to defend itself, Israel must fully comply with its obligations under international law in all circumstances, including International Humanitarian Law," the statement said.</p>

<p>The Hague-based ICC says the warrants for Netanyahu and his former minister were "for crimes against humanity and war crimes committed from at least 8 October 2023 until at least 20 May 2024".</p>

<p>Italy had asked for a discussion on the ICC warrants at the G7, after apparent splits within Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's government over what it meant for Netanyahu.</p>

<p>A diplomatic source said the discussion in Fiuggi was "much broader and more strategic" than what ended up in the final statement, without revealing details.</p>

<p>War has raged in Gaza since Hamas's October 7, 2023, attack on Israel, which resulted in 1,207 deaths, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory campaign has killed at least 44,249 people in Gaza, most of them civilians, according to figures from the Hamas-run territory's health ministry that the United Nations considers reliable.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich has said Israel should occupy the Gaza Strip and halve its Palestinian population by encouraging "voluntary emigration".]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich has said Israel should occupy the Gaza Strip and halve its Palestinian population by encouraging "voluntary emigration".</p>

<p>"We can and must conquer the Gaza Strip, we should not be afraid of that word," Smotrich said late Monday at an event organised by the Yesha Council, an umbrella group representing Israeli settlers in the occupied West Bank.</p>

<p>"There is no doubt that in Gaza -- with the encouragement of voluntary emigration -- there is here, in my opinion, a unique opportunity that is opening up with the new administration," the minister said, referring to Donald Trump's recent re-election.</p>

<p>"We can create a situation in which, within two years, the population of Gaza will be reduced by half," Smotrich said.</p>

<p>Smotrich leads the ultranationalist Religious Zionism party and has courted controversy with his comments in recent months.</p>

<p>In August, he triggered international uproar by suggesting it would be justified to starve two million Gazans to free Israeli hostages in the Palestinian territory.</p>

<p>On November 14, a Human Rights Watch report alleged that Israel's mass displacement of Gazans amounted to a "crime against humanity", a claim which Israel dismissed as "completely false".</p>

<p>According to HRW, "Israel's actions appear to also meet the definition of ethnic cleansing" in the areas where Palestinians will not be allowed to return.</p>

<p>The European Union's outgoing foreign policy chief Josep Borrell has previously condemned Israel's actions in Gaza. "The words 'ethnic cleansing' are increasingly used to describe what is going on in north Gaza," Borrell said in a social media post on November 11.</p>

<p>Smotrich and fellow far-right cabinet member, National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir, previously sparked outcry in January with "voluntary transfer" plans for Gaza's 2.4 million population.</p>

<p>The United States at the time rejected their "irresponsible" statements.</p>

<p>Israel occupied the Gaza Strip in 1967 and maintained troops and settlements there until 2005.</p>

<p>After its withdrawal, it imposed a crippling blockade on the territory and, since the start of the current war, a near-total siege.</p>

<p>Militant group Hamas seized sole power in Gaza in 2007 after ousting loyalists of the Palestinian Authority.</p>

<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has rejected the return of Jewish settlers to Gaza, despite support for the idea from Smotrich and other members of his hard-right ruling coalition.</p>

<p>The Gaza war began with Hamas's unprecedented attack on Israel on October 7 last year, which resulted in the deaths of 1,207 people, most of them civilians, according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory campaign has killed 44,249 people in Gaza, according to figures from the Hamas-run territory's health ministry that the United Nations considers reliable.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The event, which included a red carpet and festive displays, was held in the rural Sichuan province and drew widespread outrage from the public and the victim's family.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A shocking incident in China has stirred controversy, where a convicted murderer, recently released after serving a 20-year sentence, celebrated his freedom with a grand banquet and fireworks outside his victim's former home. The event, which included a red carpet and festive displays, was held in the rural Sichuan province and drew widespread outrage from the public and the victim's family.&nbsp;The extravagant celebration featured 18 elaborately set banquet tables in front of their residence.</p>

<p>According to the <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scmp.com/news/people-culture/trending-china/article/3287585/china-killer-holds-celebratory-banquet-outside-victims-home-after-20-year-jail-angers-family">South China Morning Post,</a></em> the victim's son, who was 15 at the time of his father's brutal killing, shared details on social media, recounting how the murder was carried out in their home. He noted his father, just 39 years old and on the verge of establishing his career, was brutally murdered in his bedroom and his body was doused with petrol and set ablaze. Xiang clarified that the murder stemmed from a dispute between his father's relatives and the mastermind behind the crime.</p>

<p>He described the celebration as a deliberate provocation and expressed frustration over the perceived lack of justice, given the killer's public display of celebration and his lack of remorse.&nbsp;</p>

<p data-qa="Component-Component" datatype="p">"If I had the chance, I'd like to talk to the killer. Not to vent my anger, but to understand why he made the choice that brought so much pain to two families. But on the day of his release, I was met with blatant provocation and overwhelming malice," Xiang expressed in the video.</p>

<p>Despite urgent appeals to stop the festivities, the celebration continued until local law enforcement and government officials stepped in to intervene. A representative from the Qingyi Town government confirmed that upon receiving a report about the incident, local officials, police, and village leaders swiftly responded and conducted educational sessions with the convict and his family.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The incident has sent shockwaves through the community,&nbsp;with many questioning the effectiveness of the justice system in protecting victims' families and holding perpetrators accountable. One user wrote, "What was the point of 20 years in prison? If he received a reduced sentence, it was clearly a mistake." Another commented, "A murderer like this shouldn't have been released. Investigate that prison thoroughly."</p>

<p>According to China's Criminal Law, individuals sentenced to death with a two-year reprieve may be eligible for a reduced sentence. If the individual exhibits good behaviour and makes notable contributions during the reprieve period, their sentence can be commuted.&nbsp;However, any reduction in sentence cannot result in a term of less than 20 years.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prince Harry and other high-profile British figures' privacy lawsuits against the Daily Mail newspaper's publisher will go to trial in early 2026, London's High Court heard on Tuesday, with the parties' legal costs set to exceed 38 million pounds ($47.8 million).</p>

<p>Harry, the younger son of King Charles, is one of seven claimants suing Associated Newspapers over allegations of voicemail interception - commonly known as phone-hacking - and other serious privacy breaches dating back 30 years.</p>

<p>Associated, which also publishes the Mail on Sunday, has always denied involvement in unlawful practices. Its lawyers said in filings for a preliminary hearing on Tuesday that the claimants' allegations were "firmly denied".</p>

<p>The publisher's attempt to throw out the lawsuits was rejected last year, paving the way for a trial which the claimants and Associated say should begin in early 2026.</p>

<p>Lawyers representing the claimants, who also include singer Elton John and actors Elizabeth Hurley and Sadie Frost, expect to spend around 18.4 million pounds up to and including the trial, with Associated incurring nearly 20 million pounds, according to court filings made public on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Harry and the other claimants' lawsuits, which were filed in 2022, marked the first time Associated had been dragged into the phone-hacking scandal, which emerged more than a decade ago and prompted a public inquiry into the ethics of the press and several criminal trials.</p>

<p>It also sparked long-running litigation against Rupert Murdoch's British newspaper arm, News Group Newspapers, and the publisher of the Daily Mirror, Mirror Group Newspapers (MGN).</p>

<p>Harry's case against Associated is one of several he has brought against British media organisations as part of his "mission" to purge executives and editors whom he accuses of spreading lies and intruding into people's lives.</p>

<p>The prince accepted substantial damages from MGN to settle the remainder of his phone-hacking lawsuit, having been awarded 140,600 pounds (around $178,000) after the High Court ruled he had been targeted by journalists.</p>

<p>Harry's case against News Group Newspapers is due to go to trial in January.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said Tuesday that import tariffs proposed by President-elect Donald Trump will do nothing to stop US-bound undocumented migration or drug trafficking.</p>

<p>"President Trump, it is not with threats or tariffs that the migration phenomenon will be stopped, nor the consumption of drugs in the United States," she told reporters, reading a letter she will send to Trump in which she proposes dialogue.</p>

<p>Trump said Monday he would impose a 25 percent tariff on all imports from Mexico and Canada as one of his first actions upon becoming US president in January.</p>

<p>"This Tariff will remain in effect until such time as Drugs, in particular Fentanyl, and all Illegal Aliens stop this Invasion of our Country!" Trump wrote on his Truth Social page, without mentioning the trilateral free trade agreement both countries share with the United States.</p>

<p>He also vowed a 10 percent tariff on imports from China.</p>

<p>The United States, Mexico and Canada are tied to a three-decade-old free trade agreement, now called the USMCA, that was renegotiated under Trump after he complained that US businesses, especially automakers, were losing out.</p>

<p>Trump, who won an election in which illegal migration was a top issue, has vowed to declare a national emergency on border security and use the US military to carry out a mass deportation of undocumented migrants.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russia launched a record 188 drones at Ukraine overnight, Kyiv said Tuesday, amid growing international tensions after Russia fired a nuclear-capable missile that could reach European cities.</p>

<p>The Kremlin declined on Tuesday to confirm that Ukrainian forces had again launched US-provided long-range ATACMS at Russia this week but blamed Washington for escalating the conflict nonetheless.</p>

<p>Moscow and Kyiv have been ratcheting up their drone and missile broadsides, with Ukraine recently firing US long-range missiles at Russia and the Kremlin retaliating with an experimental hypersonic missile.</p>

<p>The barrage came as ambassadors from Ukraine and NATO's 32 members were due to meet in Brussels over Russia's firing last week of the intermediate-range missile on the city of Dnipro.</p>

<p>"During the night attack, the enemy launched a record number of Shahed strike unmanned aerial vehicles and unidentified drones," the air force said Tuesday, referring to Iranian-designed drones and putting the overall number fired at 188.</p>

<p>The air force said it had shot down 76 Russian drones in 17 regions, while another 95 were either lost from their radars or downed by electronic jamming defensive systems. It did not specify what happened to the remainder.</p>

<p>Moscow also fired four Iskander-M ballistic missiles, the air force said.</p>

<p>"Unfortunately, critical infrastructure facilities were hit, private and apartment buildings were damaged in several regions," a statement said.</p>

<p><strong>Explosions in Kyiv</strong></p>

<p>AFP journalists heard explosions ring out over the capital, while Kyiv city officials said the air alert had lasted five hours and 10 Russian drones were shot down there.</p>

<p>In the western Ternopil region, which is among those spared the worst of the fighting, authorities said drones had damaged a "critical infrastructure facility," without elaborating.</p>

<p>They said however that the attack had disrupted electricity in the city of Ternopil and surrounding towns, and that engineers were working to stabilise supplies.</p>

<p>Putin had said the new missile attack last week was in response to Ukraine firing weapons supplied by the United States and Britain into Russia.</p>

<p>The Kremlin leader warned that Moscow felt it had the right to hit military facilities in countries that allow Ukraine to use their weapons against Russia.</p>

<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky last week called the strike "the latest bout of Russian madness" and appealed for updated air-defence systems to meet the new threat.</p>

<p>Kyiv says it hopes to get "concrete and meaningful outcomes" after calling the meeting of the NATO-Ukraine Council.</p>

<p>But diplomats and officials at NATO have played down expectations for any major results from the consultations on Tuesday afternoon at the alliance's Brussels headquarters.</p>

<p>The most that is expected is a reiteration of NATO's earlier insistence that Moscow's deployment of the new weaponry will not "deter NATO allies from supporting Ukraine".</p>

<p><strong>Russian forces advance</strong></p>

<p>The meeting "provides an opportunity to discuss the current security situation in Ukraine and will include briefings from Ukrainian officials via video link," a NATO official said.</p>

<p>The Kremlin dismissed the meeting saying it was unlikely any significant decisions would be taken.</p>

<p>On the battlefield, Ukraine's fatigued troops are struggling to halt advances by Russian forces in the east of the country.</p>

<p>Russia said Tuesday its troops had captured another village in the Kharkiv region, in an area where the front line had been relatively stable until recently.</p>

<p>The defence ministry said its units had "liberated" the settlement of Kopanky," a village near the Ukrainian-held city of Kupiansk that was previously captured by Russian forces at the start of the 2022 offensive before being re-taken by Ukraine later that year.</p>

<p>Moscow also on Tuesday confirmed it had detained a British man it captured fighting for Ukraine in Kyiv's offensive into Russia's western Kursk region.</p>

<p>A court in the region said it had on Monday ordered James Scott Rhys Anderson be remanded in custody, alleging he had "participated in armed hostilities on the territory of the Kursk region".</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Earlier this month, tragic news from Texas brought the abortion debate into sharp focus.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-11/dslr8lu8_antiabortion-marchers-rally-reuters_625x300_01_November_24.jpeg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>

<p class="ins_instory_dv_caption"></p>
</div>

<p>Earlier this month, tragic news from Texas brought the abortion debate into sharp focus. According to a media report, a pregnant woman died because medical staff delayed care due to fear of legal repercussions under the state's strict abortion laws. Such stories underline the life-threatening consequences of restricting reproductive rights.</p>

<p>Vice President Kamala Harris made abortion rights the heart of her campaign, but President-elect Donald Trump first waffled on his positions on abortion but towards the end of his campaign he finally admitted he would "not support a federal abortion ban, under any circumstances." But the abortion rights activist fear Trump might do the opposite. America may become intolerant to unwanted pregnancies. It may become a place where coming out of the closest could be looked down upon.</p>

<p>In any case, across the US, 41 states now enforce abortion bans, many with minor exceptions. Thirteen of these have outright bans, leaving women with few options even in cases of severe health risks.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, on the other side of the world, countries like Iran, Iraq, and Saudi Arabia enforce equally harsh abortion restrictions, rooted in religious principles. In Iran, the Youthful Population and Protection of the Family Law, introduced in 2021, has made obtaining an abortion even harder, emphasising state control over women's reproductive choices.</p>

<p>What ties these regions together is a shared ideological conservatism-one that prioritises the moral sanctity of foetal life over women's autonomy. In both conservative US states and Islamic fundamentalist societies, the convergence of politics, religion, and societal norms has turned women's health into a battleground.</p>

<p>I am writing these lines from a liberal man's perspective but I often hear in my Muslim friends and families' circles strong arguments in support of abortion bans.</p>

<p>The idea here is to show that the two sides might be sworn enemies, almost incapable of seeing eye to eye, but quite interestingly they speak the same ideological language and practise the same dogma. Whether it's on religion or abortion or whether it's on the role of women and their collective disdain for gay people. It's hard to believe how much they have in common-until you remember they can't stand each other. I'm talking more Evangelicals in America and Muslim fundamentalists in the Islamic world.</p>

<p><strong>Two sides of the same ideological coin</strong></p>

<p>Strange bedfellows? politically yes but ideologically not quite. They are more like two sides of the same ultra-conservative coin, but wittingly or unwittingly locked in a battle of supremacy. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Recently, the world watched, as a young Iranian woman staged a bold protest, removing her hijab and clothes in public at a university, defying a government that enforces compulsory hijab laws with a heavy hand. Her act of rebellion harks back to the tragic case of Mahsa Amini, a Kurdish-Iranian woman who died in police custody in 2022 after being detained for not wearing her hijab "properly." The nationwide protests following Amini's death highlighted the deep resentment against these restrictive laws.</p>

<p>So, in one world-the conservative US states-women fear criminalisation for seeking abortions, bound by laws that strip them of autonomy over their own bodies. In another world-places like Iran-women defy oppressive mandates, risking everything to assert their right to freedom.</p>

<p>I have often wondered about two things, without giving them much thought: how the Evangelicals of America and the ultra-fundamentalists of Iran and other Islamic states, such as Saudi Arabia, seem to speak the same language and use identical idioms-yet why do they hate each other despite being cut from the same ideological cloth? But first, let's take a quick look at some of the views the two sides share on a variety of issues.</p>

<p>Family Values, a cornerstone of society: Both Islamic and Evangelical fundamentalists emphasise the centrality of the family as a divinely ordained unit. In many conservative Islamic societies, family is seen as the bedrock of a society, based on morality, with strict roles for men as providers and women as caretakers. I believe the family structure is designed to preserve religious and cultural traditions. Evangelical Christians in the US similarly prioritise family roles. They too advocate for traditional gender roles, with the husband as the head of the household and the wife in a submissive role. Both groups view the family as under attack from liberal views of secularists, such as single parenthood, same-sex parenting or gender fluidity. They see these views as a threat to social order.</p>

<p>Homosexuality is against nature: Conservative Rev Jerry Falwell had once said: "AIDS is the wrath of a just God against homosexuals". &nbsp;Ayatollah Abdol-Hamid Masoumi-Tehrani, an Iranian cleric, has referred to homosexuality as a "moral corruption" and aligned it with societal decay, suggesting that such behaviour brings misfortune upon communities, a sentiment echoing Falwell's rhetoric.</p>

<p>Homosexuality is widely condemned in conservative Islamic contexts, often punished severely, including imprisonment or even execution in some countries. Gender fluidity is considered unnatural and an affront. Evangelicals oppose same-sex marriages and gender identity rights, viewing them as sins. For them, only two genders exist -- male and female</p>

<p>Liberal Values as Satan's Workshop: Both Islamic and Evangelical fundamentalists reject liberal values, associating them with moral decay and godlessness. In Islamic societies, liberal ideas like freedom of speech, individualism, and secularism are often condemned as corrupting influences from the West, undermining culture and morality. Music, art and media that challenge traditional norms are viewed with suspicion. Evangelicals similarly view liberal values, such as LGBTQ+ rights, reproductive freedom and secular governance, as evidence of a decay.</p>

<p>If their views on many issues converge and overlap, why do they hate each other? I think it stems from historical, cultural and political factors. Let's consider the following:</p>

<p>Historical Hostility and Religious Exclusivity: Both Islamic and Evangelical fundamentalists claim exclusive access to ultimate truth, which puts them in opposite camps. One set of people views the other as misguided at best or heretical at worst.</p>

<p>Historical Conflicts: In the Islamic world, children in educated families grow up knowing about the Crusades, Spanish Inquisition and centuries of atrocities committed by the Catholics against Muslims. Centuries of historical clashes have left deep scars on their psyche. Evangelical Christians often see Islam as a "threat to Western civilisation," while Islamic fundamentalists view Christian missionaries and Western expansion as attempts to undermine their culture and religion.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cultural Hegemony and Identity Politics: Their shared ideological views are overshadowed by cultural and nationalistic narratives that pit them against each other. Evangelicals in the US often see themselves as defenders of a "Christian America" against perceived external threats. Political rhetoric about the "clash of civilisations" feeds into this dynamic, painting Muslims as adversaries in a broader cultural war. Islamic fundamentalists often see Western Christian powers, including evangelical movements, as aggressors trying to impose their values and political dominance on Muslim-majority societies. The US invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan and evangelical missionary activities are often cited as examples of Western hostility.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Political Alignment and Global Power Dynamics Following the 9/11 terror attack, President George Bush declared a war against Islamic terrorism. For the proposed war, he used the word 'crusade', which stirred old hostilities between Christians and Muslims. The choice of the word 'crusade' coming from the US president may just have been accidental but that was not how it was viewed in the Muslim world. He came in for a massive criticism by Muslim leaders. Many Evangelicals support US foreign policies that are perceived as hostile to Muslim-majority nations, such as unwavering support for Israel, military interventions in West Asia and policies against Muslim immigration.</p>

<p>Media Narratives and Fearmongering Both groups are often manipulated by political actors and media to stoke fear and division. In Western narratives, Islamic extremists are often portrayed as violent ones while Evangelicals are projected as defenders of Western values.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Rivalry in preaching their religious faiths: The two groups' approaches to spreading their faith also create conflict. Evangelicals actively proselytise, often working to convert others. Islamic fundamentalists also promote dawah (inviting others to Islam), but their efforts are often localised or defensive, aimed at countering Western influence rather than converting Christians.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a world where identity politics often outweigh shared ideologies, I tend to believe that these two groups are unlikely to find common ground despite their similar stances on family, gender and morality.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>She has collaborated with various brands and has become a prominent figure in Pakistan's social media landscape. She also runs a successful TikTok channel.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>A string of similar incidents</strong></p>

<p>Last week, a private video of Pakistani TV host and influencer Mathira Mohammad was leaked on social media.&nbsp;Several explicit clips allegedly showed Mathira in a compromising position. However, the videos could not be verified.&nbsp;The 32-year-old influencer said that people are misusing her name and photoshoot pictures and creating fake photos.</p>

<p>Before that,&nbsp;a private video of Pakistan TikTok star&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/who-is-imsha-rehman-pakistani-tiktok-star-caught-in-video-leak-scandal-7030925">Imsha Rehman</a>&nbsp;went viral, showing her in an intimate position. She faced a lot of backlash from social media users, who accused her of intentionally making the video public to gain attention. In response, she deactivated her social media accounts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Previously, an alleged intimate video of another Pakistani social media personality Minahil Malik with her boyfriend was circulated online, forcing her as well to deactivate her accounts. She also claimed that the video was "fake" and lodged a complaint with the&nbsp;Federal Investigation Agency (FIA).</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Uncontrolled social media networks and artificial intelligence amplify the worst human impulses, allowing hate speech to spread like wildfire and ignite violence, UN secretary general Antonio Guterres said on Tuesday.</p>

<p>"We must reign in hate speech and disinformation spreading online," Guterres told a top-level meeting of the United Nations' Alliance of Civilisations (UNAOC) in Portugal.</p>

<p>"Unchecked digital platforms and Artificial Intelligence have endowed hate speech with a speed and reach unseen before," he told UNAOC's 10th global forum in Cascais, near Lisbon.</p>

<p>"The worst impulses of humanity are given a megaphone, and many times they lead to violence," he told a session at the gathering on "upending hate".</p>

<p>The proliferation of deepfakes online allowed "the impossible and the unverified (to) become credible in an instant", Guterres said.</p>

<p>"Misinformation and outright lies are fuelling repulsive anti-semitism, anti-Muslim bigotry and attacks on minority Christian communities, among others," Guterres said.</p>

<p>Social media and AI offered a "new medium" for these "old tactics".</p>

<p>The UN leader reiterated his pleas for peace in Gaza, Lebanon, Ukraine and Sudan.</p>

<p>The UN Alliance of Civilisations seeks to promote "cultural diversity, religious pluralism and mutual respect".</p>

<p>This year's global forum -- whose attendees include presidents, ministers and the heads of international bodies -- runs from November 25 to 27.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The number of new HIV infections and deaths is falling worldwide, marking significant progress in the fight against the disease.</p>

<p>But HIV is far from being stamped out and more needs to be done, health experts warned ahead of World AIDS Day on Sunday.</p>

<p><strong>Uneven progress</strong></p>

<p>Fewer people contracted HIV last year than at any point since the rise of the disease in the late 1980s, according to a UNAIDS report on Tuesday.</p>

<p>But the 1.3 million new HIV cases recorded in 2023 is still more than three times higher than needed to reach the UN's goal of ending AIDS as a public health threat by 2030, the UN agency said.</p>

<p>Last year also saw around 630,000 people die from AIDS-related illnesses, the lowest level since a peak of 2.1 million in 2004.</p>

<p>A separate study published in The Lancet HIV journal on Tuesday found that the number of HIV infections across the world declined by a fifth during the 2010s.</p>

<p>Deaths related to HIV, which are generally caused by other diseases during the late stages of AIDS, fell by about 40 percent to below a million a year, the study said.</p>

<p>The decline was mainly driven by improving rates in sub-Saharan Africa, which is by far the hardest-hit region in the global epidemic.</p>

<p>However infections did not go down everywhere. Other regions, such as Eastern Europe and the Middle East, saw HIV numbers increase.</p>

<p>"The world has made remarkable global progress to significantly reduce the number of new HIV infections," said lead study author Hmwe Kyu of the US-based Institute For Health Metrics and Evaluation.</p>

<p>"More than a million people acquire a new HIV infection each year and, of the 40 million people living with HIV, a quarter are not receiving treatment," she said in a statement.</p>

<p><strong>Effective tools, for some</strong></p>

<p>Preventative treatments called Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) have proven to be a powerful tool in the fight against HIV.</p>

<p>These daily pills reduce the risk of getting HIV from sex by around 99 percent, and have helped drive down HIV rates in many countries.</p>

<p>But "only 15 percent of people who need PrEP were receiving it in 2023," UNAIDS said, pointing to anti-gay laws such as in Uganda hindering access to these life-saving treatments.</p>

<p>For people who have been infected with HIV, antiretroviral therapy can reduce the amount of the virus in their blood to undetectable levels.</p>

<p>But around 9.3 million people -- nearly a quarter of those living with HIV worldwide -- were not receiving this treatment, UNAIDS warned.</p>

<p><strong>New drug raises hopes</strong></p>

<p>These tools have worked well in wealthier countries but the high costs have meant that poorer countries -- such as in Africa -- have often been left behind.</p>

<p>There are fears that this history could repeat for a new drug that has been hailed as a potential game-changer in the battle against HIV.</p>

<p>Early trials have found that the antiretroviral treatment lenacapavir is 100 percent effective in preventing HIV infection. And it only needs to be injected twice a year, making the drug far easier to administer than current regimens requiring daily pills.</p>

<p>US pharmaceutical giant Gilead has been charging around $40,000 per person per a year for the treatment in several countries.</p>

<p>But researchers have estimated the drug could be made for as little as $40, calling on Gilead to allow for cheaper access in hard-hit nations.</p>

<p>Last month, Gilead announced it had signed licensing deals with six generic drugmakers to produce and sell lenacapavir in lower-income countries.</p>

<p>While experts largely welcomed the move, some noted that millions of people with HIV live in countries not included in the deal.</p>

<p>The twice-yearly injection is also hoped to help get around another problem for administering HIV drugs -- the stigma that comes along with having the disease.</p>

<p><strong>What about a vaccine?</strong></p>

<p>Despite decades of effort, a vaccine for HIV remains elusive.</p>

<p>But the lenacapavir shot is "like having a vaccine basically", Andrew Hill, a researcher at the UK's Liverpool University, told AFP earlier this year.</p>

<p>A handful of patients have also been effectively cured of HIV.</p>

<p>But these cures happen only after a patient endures a brutal stem cell transplant for their leukaemia, so is not an option for almost all people living with HIV.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The only son of Malaysian billionaire Ananda Krishnan, Ven Ajahn Siripanyo gave up the world of riches and spoils to become a Buddhist monk.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Robin Sharma, in his bestseller "The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari", wrote about a successful lawyer, Julian Mantle, who sold his worldly possessions to embrace a spiritual journey. While Mantle's story was fictional, Thai-Malaysian monk Ven Ajahn Siripanyo denounced a fortune worth billions in real life for spiritual servitude.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The only son of Malaysian billionaire Ananda Krishnan, Ven Ajahn Siripanyo gave up the world of riches and spoils to become a Buddhist monk. Mr Krishnan, also known as AK, is Malaysia's third richest man and is worth more than US$5 billion (Rs 40,000 crore approx), according to a report by South China Morning Post.&nbsp;</p>

<p>His business empire spans across telecom, satellites, media, oil, gas, and real estate industries. The billionaire also owns Aircel, the phone company that once sponsored the renowned IPL team Chennai Super Kings, led by cricket legend MS Dhoni.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Despite being groomed from an early age to inherit Mr Krishnan's substantial fortune, Ajahn Siripanyo chose to detach himself from worldly possessions at the age of 18, a decision his father respects. Mr Krishnan is reportedly a devout Buddhist himself, who engages in several philanthropist and charitable endeavours.</p>

<h2><strong>Ven Ajahn Siripanyo's Spiritual Journey</strong></h2>

<p>On top of being a billionaire's son, Ajahn Siripanyo is also reportedly a blue-blooded noble. His mother, Momwajarongse Suprinda Chakraban, is a descendant of the Thai royal family, according to the South China Morning Post report.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When Ajahn Siripanyo was 18 years old, he went to Thailand to pay homage to his Thai mother's family. During his trip, he reportedly ordained at a retreat temporarily for fun. However, what started as a temporary experience eventually evolved into a permanent commitment. Now, over twenty years down the line, the modern-day Siddhartha is reportedly a forest monk.</p>

<p>He resides at the Dtao Dum Monastery located somewhere on the Thailand-Myanmar border as an abbot.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Occasional Embrace Of Oppilance</strong></h3>

<p>Ajahn Siripanyo, along with his two sisters, grew up in London. He completed his studies in the UK and is known to speak at least eight languages including English. Quoting sources, the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scmp.com/magazines/style/celebrity/article/3093934/billionaire-heir-who-became-monk-why-son-malaysias-third" rel="No Follow, No Index" target="_blank">South China Morning Post</a> reported that Ajahn Siripanyo's outlook in life as being open to different cultures, so it doesn't come as a surprise that embraced Buddhist teachings.</p>

<p>As per the report, though the monk lives on the generosity of others on a daily basis, he accepts his opulence where it is necessary. As one of the precepts of Buddhism is familial love, Ajahn Siripanyo makes time to see his father now and then and reports to his old lifestyle temporarily.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The world's oldest man, Briton John Tinniswood, has died aged 112 at the care home where he lived in Southport, northwest England, Guinness World Records said on Tuesday, quoting his family.</p>

<p>Tinniswood was born in Liverpool on August 26, 1912, and died on Monday.</p>

<p>He became the world's oldest man in April following the death of 114-year-old Venezuelan Juan Vicente Perez.</p>

<p>"His last day was surrounded by music and love," the family said in a statement, also thanking "all those who cared for him over the years".</p>

<p>Born the same year the Titanic sank and living through both World Wars, Tinniswood told Guinness World Records that the secret to his longevity was "pure luck".</p>

<p>"You either live long or you live short, and you can't do much about it," he said.</p>

<p>He nonetheless advised moderation in all things to stay healthy.</p>

<p>"If you drink too much or you eat too much or you walk too much, if you do too much of anything, you're going to suffer eventually," he added.</p>

<p>During World War Two, Tinniswood held an administrative role in the Royal Army Pay Corps, going on to work in accounts for oil giants Shell and BP.</p>

<p>He was a life-long supporter of Liverpool football club, and ate fish and chips every Friday.</p>

<p>The world's oldest living woman currently is Japan's Tomiko Itooka, who is 116.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Warren Buffett, philanthropist and multi-billionaire CEO of American multinational conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway, has donated another $1.2 billion of his wealth to foundations, serving his 2006 pledge to steadily donate his $150 billion wealth.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Warren &nbsp;Buffett, philanthropist and multi-billionaire CEO of American multinational conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway, has donated another $1.2 billion of his wealth to foundations, serving his 2006 pledge to steadily donate his $150 billion wealth during his lifetime and beyond.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In his letter to the shareholders, the 94-year-old CEO reflected upon life and how "fickle" it can be, sharing his most detailed plan to donate his fortunes after his death.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>'Father, Time Always Wins'</strong></p>

<p>In his four-page letter to the shareholders, Mr Buffett announced that he would "convert 1,600 A shares into 2,400,000 B shares to give these B shares to four family foundations: 1,500,000 shares to The Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation and 300,000 shares to each of The Sherwood Foundation, The Howard G. Buffett Foundation and NoVo Foundation.</p>

<p>"Father time always wins. But he can be fickle - indeed unfair and even cruel - sometimes ending life at birth or soon thereafter while, at other times, waiting a century or so before paying a visit. To date, I've been very lucky, but, before long, he will get around to me," Mr Buffett said, reflecting on how he thought his first wife, Susie, would outlive him and subsequently donate the vast majority of their fortune, but "that was not to be."</p>

<p>Read the full letter:&nbsp;<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/news/nov2524.pdf" rel="noindex,nofollow">BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC</a></p>

<p>With his $1.2 billion donations, his class A shares in Berkshire Hathaway - which accounts for 99.5% of his $150 billion wealth - have reduced to 206,363 shares after he gave way almost 56.6% of his shareholdings since his pledge in 2006. He is currently the sixth richest person in the world according to Forbes.</p>

<p>"In 2004, before Susie, my first wife, died, the two of us owned 508,998 Class A shares. For decades, we had both thought that she would outlive me and subsequently distribute the vast majority of our large fortune. That was not to be," he said.</p>

<p><strong>Warren Buffett's New Will</strong></p>

<p>The Berkshire CEO made changes to his will, detailing how he plans to donate the rest of his wealth after his death. Mr Buffett said that he and his first wife Susie had "long encouraged" their children in small philanthropic activities and had been pleased with their enthusiasm, diligence and results. Since 2006, their philanthropic activities have dramatically increased.</p>

<p>He hopes his three children - Susie, Howie and Peter - will gradually distribute all of his Berkshire holdings that account for 99.5% of his wealth. In his lifetime, Mr Buffett has donated more than $60 billion of his wealth to various foundations, a majority of which, approximately $43 billion, to the Gates Foundation run by Bill and Melinda Gates.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As he reflected upon mortality, relationships and the fickle nature of life, he talked about a downside to his "good fortune" and said, "The expected life span of my children has materially diminished since the 2006 pledge. They are now 71, 69 and 66. I've never wished to create a dynasty or pursue any plan that extended beyond the children. I know the three well and trust them completely. Future generations are another matter. Who can foresee the priorities, intelligence and fidelity of successive generations to deal with the distribution of extraordinary wealth amid what may be a far different philanthropic landscape? Still, the massive wealth I've collected may take longer to deploy than my children live."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mr Buffett has assigned three potential successor trustees for the distribution of wealth, each being well-known to his children and is "somewhat younger to them." However, he hopes that the trustees stay on the waitlist, and his children fulfil the responsibility in their lifetime.</p>

<p>His children have to "unanimously" decide on how to donate his wealth, a caveat in his will, which he explained in his letter through the unpleasant reality of philanthropy and those who can distribute huge sums are forever regarded as "targets of opportunity."</p>

<p><strong>'One Suggestion For All Parents'</strong></p>

<p>"I have one further suggestion for all parents, whether they are of modest or staggering wealth. When your children are mature, have them read your will before you sign it," he said in his letter.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Be sure each child understands both the logic for your decisions and the responsibilities they will encounter upon your death. If any have questions or suggestions, listen carefully and adopt those found sensible. You don't want your children asking "Why?" in respect to testamentary decisions when you are no longer able to respond."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Beijing said Tuesday it deployed air and naval forces to monitor a US military plane as it flew over politically sensitive waters separating China and Taiwan.</p>

<p>The United States and its allies regularly cross through the 180-kilometre (112-mile) Taiwan Strait, either by ship or aircraft, to reinforce the international status of the waterway, angering Beijing.</p>

<p>China considers Taiwan to be part of its territory and claims jurisdiction over the body of water separating the two.</p>

<p>To assert its claims, Beijing regularly deploys fighter jets and warships around the island, while opposing transits by military ships and aircraft belonging to the United States and its allies.</p>

<p>"A US Navy P-8A Poseidon transited the Taiwan Strait in international airspace on Nov. 26, 2024 (local time)," the US Navy's 7th Fleet said in a statement.</p>

<p>"The aircraft's transit of the Taiwan Strait demonstrates the United States' commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific."</p>

<p>China said it had monitored the aircraft and condemned the flight for being "openly hyped".</p>

<p>"US remarks distort legal principles, confuse the public and mislead international perception," said Cao Jun, a senior colonel and spokesman for China's Eastern Theatre Air Force, in a statement.</p>

<p>Beijing had "organised naval and air forces to monitor and guard the trajectory of the US aircraft and effectively responded and dealt with it", Cao added.</p>

<p>During a previous transit by a US P-8A Poseidon in September, the Chinese military tailed the aircraft.</p>

<p>The United States is Taiwan's most important security partner, but like most other countries it does not have official diplomatic relations with Taipei.</p>

<p>Taiwan's defence ministry said Tuesday that the US P-8A aircraft flew from south to north through the Taiwan Strait in the morning.</p>

<p>The Taiwan military "fully monitored the movements in the surrounding sea and airspace, and the situation remained normal," the ministry said in a statement.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A Walmart spokesperson confirmed the changes, stating, "We are willing to change alongside our associates and customers who represent all of America."]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Walmart has announced plans to cut back on some of its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, a spokesperson said on Monday. The move comes amid growing pressure from conservative groups.</p>

<p>The US retail joint will no longer consider race and gender when granting supplier contracts, according to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-25/walmart-cuts-dei-pride-after-activist-starbuck-threatens-boycott" rel="noindex,nofollow">Bloomberg</a>. The company will also scale back racial equity training and stop participating in rankings by the Human Rights Campaign, an LGBTQ advocacy group.</p>

<p>A Walmart spokesperson confirmed the changes, stating, "We are willing to change alongside our associates and customers who represent all of America."</p>

<p>Walmart's decision follows a similar move by other major US companies, including Starbucks, JPMorgan Chase, and Ford. These companies have modified their DEI policies in response to pressure from conservative groups.</p>

<p>Conservative activist Robby Starbuck claimed credit for Walmart's decision, stating that he had "productive conversations" with company executives. Starbuck has been a vocal critic of DEI initiatives and has targeted several companies over their employment policies.</p>

<p>In addition to scaling back its DEI initiatives, Walmart has also agreed to monitor its online marketplace for listings that may be deemed objectionable or what Starbuck describes as "sexual and/or transgender products marketed to children" and remove them if necessary.</p>

<p>The company will also review its grants for Pride events to ensure that they are not supporting "sexualised content" that may be unsuitable for children.<br />

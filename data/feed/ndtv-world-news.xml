       <description><![CDATA[Kamala Harris is not yet the Democratic Party's candidate for president but her status online is already clear: she is a meme.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kamala Harris is not yet the Democratic Party's candidate for president but her status online is already clear: she is a meme.</p>

<p>In the latest testament to her viral presence among Gen Z, British pop sensation Charli XCX name-checked her in a weekend tweet that called the vice president a "brat".</p>

<p>&nbsp;And Harris' campaign is leaning into it.</p>

<p>Soon after the artist tweeted "kamala IS brat" on Sunday night - giving Harris the name of her latest album – the U.S. vice president adopted the album's lime green aesthetic for her "Kamala HQ" account.</p>

<p>Charli XCX was acknowledging something that had already taken off online, where viral memes were featuring video clips of Harris dancing and joking against Charli XCX tracks.</p>

<p>Brat, the singer has explained, is "that girl who is a little messy and likes to party and like maybe says some like dumb things sometimes, who like feels herself but then also like maybe has a breakdown... It's brat, you're brat, that's brat."</p>

<p>Her tweet on Sunday sent the trend soaring, a phenomenon that could help Harris's outreach to younger voters that could play a pivotal role in the Nov. 5 election.</p>

<p>That contrasts not only with 78-year-old Republican rival Donald Trump, but with Harris's 81-year-old boss, President Joe Biden, who quit the race at the weekend and endorsed his vice president as his replacement at the top of the ticket.</p>

<p>A spokesperson for Charli XCX declined a request for an interview.</p>

<p>The 'brat' trend joins another Harris viral meme - audio from a 2023 speech that was pilloried before by critics, but is now embraced by Gen Z as a sort of existential philosophy.</p>

<p>"'You think you just fell out of a coconut tree?'" Harris asks in the speech, quoting what her mother used to say, before laughing and then growing serious. "You exist in the context of all in which you live and what came before you."</p>

<p>The Internet hive mind has adopted a coconut emoji as an unofficial campaign symbol for Harris. TikTokers have used sound from the "coconut tree" speech in at least 3,000 videos, according to TikTok.</p>

<p>Harris's membership in Alpha Kappa Alpha - the first Black Greek-letter sorority - at Howard University in Washington, D.C., is also sparking viral engagement online.</p>

<p>"Listening to the opposition knowing we have 22,190,813 members in the D9 abt (sic) to vote for Kamala!" says one video on TikTok featuring two women, one of which is in the AKA colors of pink and green. D9 refers to a group of nine historically Black fraternities and sororities.</p>

<p>To be sure, Harris has her share of haters online. Critics have pushed clips aimed at portraying her in a negative light, including compilations of her boisterous laugh, after Trump himself referred to her as "Laffin' Kamala."</p>

<p>Younger voters, who overwhelmingly vote Democratic, had so far been unenthusiastic about a presidential race between Biden and Trump, 78 years old.</p>

<p>"It's very hard to understand Gen Z unless you're Gen Z," said Chris Mowrey, a Democratic social media influencer with 340,000 TikTok followers, referring to the generation born between 1997 and 2012.</p>

<p>Internet moments can translate to the ballot box, Mowrey added: "Young voters vote significantly more based on just personality and, like, vibes."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump said on Saturday nobody warned him of a problem in the lead-up to the former president's rally in Pennsylvania when a would-be assassin shot him in the ear.</p>

<p>"Nobody mentioned it, nobody said there was a problem. I would've waited for 15, they could've said let's wait for 15 minutes, 20 minutes, 5 minutes, something. Nobody said," Trump told Fox News in an interview.</p>

<p>"I think that was a mistake," he added. "How did somebody get on that roof? And why wasn't he reported?"</p>

<p>The Washington Post on Saturday reported that top officials at the US Secret Service repeatedly rejected requests from Trump's security detail for more manpower and gear at events before the attempted assassination on July 13.</p>

<p>The agency, which is responsible for Trump's protection, denied these requests, saying at times that it lacked resources, the newspaper reported, citing people familiar with the matter.</p>

<p>Secret Service spokesman Anthony Guglielmi has previously denied accusations that the agency had rebuffed requests for more security resources from Trump's team.</p>

<p>In an emailed statement to Reuters on Sunday, Guglielmi said: "In some instances where specific Secret Service specialized units or resources were not provided, the agency made modifications to ensure the security of the protectee."</p>

<p>"This may include utilizing state or local partners to provide specialized functions or otherwise identifying alternatives to reduce public exposure of a protectee," Guglielmi added.</p>

<p>Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle is has testified before the US House of Representatives Oversight Committee that they "failed" and has take "full responsibility".</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[To get his family the water they need for drinking, bathing and laundry, Ahmed al-Shanbari steels himself for a lengthy search through the north of the Gaza Strip.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To get his family the water they need for drinking, bathing and laundry, Ahmed al-Shanbari steels himself for a lengthy search through the north of the Gaza Strip.</p>

<p>Shanbari said most of the wells near his makeshift shelter in the Jabalia refugee camp have been destroyed.</p>

<p>And the water distribution network barely works after more than nine months of war that has devastated Gaza's infrastructure.</p>

<p>Water was already scarce before the conflict erupted in October, and most of it was undrinkable. The 2.4 million population relies on an increasingly polluted and depleted aquifer, humanitarian agencies say.</p>

<p>To collect what little of the fetid supply remains can take Shanbari four hours in sweltering heat.</p>

<p>He sets off with his three children, buckets in hand, weaving through mounds of rubble and trash in search of a working spigot or an aid agency hose connected to a water truck.</p>

<p>"We are suffering greatly to obtain water," he told AFP.</p>

<p>Shanbari said the situation has worsened since heavy fighting broke out in Jabalia in May between the Israeli army and Hamas.</p>

<p>"After the last incursion, not a single well remains," he said.</p>

<p><strong>'Exhausted'</strong></p>

<p>The UN humanitarian office OCHA said most of Gaza's groundwater was contaminated with sewage even before the war. More than 97 percent was unsafe to drink.</p>

<p>Today, many aid groups describe the situation in Gaza as "catastrophic".</p>

<p>For weeks, Palestinians in Gaza have told AFP journalists about the intense thirst that drives them to delirium, their dreams of a cup of tea and the humiliation of being unable to wash.</p>

<p>For the Shanbari family, water is so precious they try not to spill a single drop after finding it.</p>

<p>From the jerrycans they haul home, they carefully transfer the water into basins for cleaning dishes and pitchers for bathing.</p>

<p>The parents say they are "exhausted" by the constant struggle to get the barest of necessities, and their children are sick.</p>

<p>"All my children have fallen ill, they're suffering from kidney failure, jaundice, itching, cough," said Shanbari. "I don't know what to say, and there aren't even medicines available in the north."</p>

<p>Not far from the Shanbari home, huge puddles of sewage, sometimes as big as ponds, cover the roads.</p>

<p><strong>Inoperable</strong></p>

<p>Even if he could locate a well with water, Shanbari said there is no fuel in the north to run the pumps needed to extract it.</p>

<p>Wastewater treatment plants are also reportedly shutting down because of the lack of fuel and fighting.</p>

<p>An expert on water infrastructure in the Gaza Strip described the territory's water distribution system as effectively inoperable.</p>

<p>Only a ceasefire could get it back up and running again, he said, given the need for spare parts and experts to access the stations and wells.</p>

<p>The Israeli military on Sunday maintained that water collection points were accessible in the Al-Mawasi humanitarian zone, to which it has ordered hundreds of thousands of Palestinians to move.</p>

<p>But people are afraid to go there after Israeli strikes on Al-Mawasi killed at least 92 people and wounded 300 on July 13, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory.</p>

<p>Israel, UN agencies and the Palestinian Authority have all raised the prospect of resupplying electricity from Israel to a desalination plant and a water treatment plant in Gaza.</p>

<p>But the local electricity distribution company said the line was still too damaged to distribute power.</p>

<p>The Gaza war was triggered by Hamas's October 7 attack on southern Israel which resulted in the deaths of 1,195 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.</p>

<p>The militants also seized 251 hostages, 116 of whom are still in Gaza, including 44 the Israeli military says are dead.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory military campaign in Gaza has killed at least 39,006 people, also mostly civilians, according to data from the Gaza health ministry.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[US Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle acknowledged on Monday that the agency failed in its mission to prevent the assassination attempt on former president Donald Trump.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle acknowledged on Monday that the agency failed in its mission to prevent the assassination attempt on former president Donald Trump.</p>

<p>"The Secret Service's solemn mission is to protect our nation's leaders," Ms Cheatle said during testimony before the House Committee on Oversight and Accountability.</p>

<p>"On July 13, we failed," she said. "As director of the United States Secret Service, I take full responsibility for any security lapse." But she rejected a wave of bipartisan calls for her resignation.</p>

<p>Ms Cheatle said the attack on Trump, who was slightly wounded in his right ear while speaking at a campaign rally, was "the most significant operational failure of the Secret Service in decades."</p>

<p>"There clearly was a mistake and we will make every effort to make sure that this never happens again," she said.</p>

<p>The 20-year-old gunman, Thomas Matthew Crooks, opened fire on Trump with an AR-style assault rifle just minutes after the former Republican president and current White House candidate began speaking at the campaign event in Butler, Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>Crooks, who was perched on the roof of a nearby building with a clear sightline of the stage, was shot dead by a Secret Service sniper 26 seconds after firing the first of eight shots.</p>

<p>Investigators have concluded that Crooks, who lived in a town about 50 miles (80 kilometers) from Butler, acted alone and have not been able to identify any strong ideological or political leanings.</p>

<p>Two rally attendees were seriously wounded in the shooting and a 50-year-old firefighter, Corey Comperatore, of Freeport, Pennsylvania, was shot dead.</p>

<p>Opening the hearing into the assassination bid, Republican committee chairman James Comer said "this tragedy was preventable" and "it is my firm belief, Director Cheadle, that you should resign."</p>

<p>"The Secret Service's protective mission is to protect US and visiting world leaders and safeguard US elections through protection of candidates and nominees," Comer said.</p>

<p>"The Secret Service has a zero-fail mission, but it failed on July 13 and in the days leading up to the rally," he said, adding the agency "has now become the face of incompetence."</p>

<p><strong>'Needs to fire you'</strong></p>

<p>Representative Michael Turner, a Republican lawmaker from Ohio, also called on Ms Cheatle to step down.</p>

<p>"Not only should you resign but if you refuse to do so, President (Joe) Biden needs to fire you because his life, Donald Trump's life, and all the other people who you protect are at risk," Turner said.</p>

<p>Ms Cheatle rebuffed the demands she resign. "I think that I am the best person to lead the Secret Service at this time," she said.</p>

<p>Ms Cheatle declined to answer many specific questions from lawmakers about the attack, saying it was still the subject of multiple active investigations.</p>

<p>"I can speak to you in generalities," she said, drawing the ire of both Republican and Democratic lawmakers on the committee.</p>

<p>Trump's former physician said over the weekend that the Republican candidate sustained a two-centimeter (almost one inch) gunshot wound on his right ear that is starting to heal.</p>

<p>The memo from ex-White House physician Ronny Jackson, now a hardline right-wing lawmaker from Texas, is the first detailed account of the injury Trump sustained.</p>

<p>"The bullet passed, coming less than a quarter of an inch from entering his head, and struck the top of his right ear," wrote Jackson, who said he flew to see Trump in New Jersey late in the evening of the rally, and had been treating him since.</p>

<p>Ms Cheatle served as a Secret Service agent for 27 years before leaving in 2021 to become the head of security in North America for PepsiCo.</p>

<p>She was named to head the agency by Biden in 2022.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[US Vice President Kamala Harris on Monday hailed her boss's legacy as "unmatched in modern history," in her first remarks since Joe Biden dropped out of the 2024 presidential race and endorsed her candidacy.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US Vice President Kamala Harris hailed Joe Biden's "unmatched" legacy Monday in her first public appearance since his shock election race exit, as Democrats rapidly coalesced around her to lead the party against Donald Trump in November.</p>

<p>In a strikingly symbolic moment, the vice president hosted a ceremony for college athletes at the White House while Biden remained stuck in isolation with Covid at his Delaware beach house.</p>

<p>A flood of Democratic leaders has backed 59-year-old Ms Harris as the party's new candidate for November's election, building momentum for a lightning-fast coronation despite some calls to show transparency with an open primary.</p>

<p>But America's first Black woman vice president did not mention her sudden elevation to likely presidential candidate, and kept the focus instead on Biden and the achievements of his one-term presidency.</p>

<p>"Joe Biden's legacy of accomplishment over the past three years is unmatched in modern history," Ms Harris said in her brief remarks on the White House South Lawn, as a light rain fell.</p>

<p>Some of her sporting metaphors did seem to nod towards the political race ahead of her, though, as she talked of bringing home the gold and "what it means to commit and to persevere."</p>

<p>Ms Harris will make a first trip to campaign headquarters in Wilmington, Delaware, later Monday -- not far from Rehoboth Beach, where Biden has spent most of the last week nursing his Covid infection.</p>

<p><strong>'Let's win this'</strong></p>

<p>Biden finally stepped aside from the 2024 race on Sunday after three weeks of pressure sparked by a disastrous debate performance that raised fears about his age and mental acuity.</p>

<p>He immediately endorsed Ms Harris, and earlier Monday a slew of Democratic heavyweights added their backing, including a number seen as potential picks for her running mate.</p>

<p>"Let's win this," posted Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, announcing her support in tandem with the governors of Illinois, Minnesota and Wisconsin.</p>

<p>The governor of Kentucky, Andy Beshear, also declared his support, as did Illinois Governor JB Pritzker.</p>

<p>Ms Harris must still win over some key hold-outs if she is to wrap up the nomination, but it could happen as early as a remote ballot on August 1, or failing that by the Democratic National Convention starting August 19.</p>

<p>Ms Harris's campaign said it had raised a stunning $49.6 million in grassroots donations since Sunday.</p>

<p>She spent more than 10 hours Sunday placing calls to over 100 party leaders and other figures, a person familiar with her schedule said -- reportedly including former president Barack Obama, who has yet to back her.</p>

<p>The stunning withdrawal by Biden has completely upended the 2024 race, transforming a long slog between two unpopular elderly men into one of the most compelling in modern US presidential history.</p>

<p>The move has brought a jolt of energy to a demoralized party that Ms Harris could now unify, and could give America its first female president.</p>

<p><strong>'Threat to democracy'</strong></p>

<p>It has also hit Republicans hard, with former president Trump, 78 -- now the oldest presidential nominee in US history -- having to completely retool a strategy that had been built around attacking Biden over his age and physical frailty.</p>

<p>Ms Harris's entry not only flips the age issue but puts Trump -- a convicted felon who has faced a series of legal cases over sexual assault -- up against a woman and former prosecutor.</p>

<p>Trump has seemed to find it hard to move on from his old opponent.</p>

<p>He launched a series of invective-filled social media posts on Sunday and Monday after Biden quit, mocking the president's age and saying he and Ms Harris posed a "threat to democracy."</p>

<p>Republicans including his running mate J.D. Vance have meanwhile focused on calling on Biden to stand down as president, saying if he is not fit to run he cannot be fit to be in the Oval Office.</p>

<p>Biden said on X on Monday that he would "continue" to work for Americans "today, tomorrow, and every day that I have the honor of being your president."</p>

<p>The challenges facing Ms Harris remain daunting, however, with less than four months until election day.</p>

<p>The vice president has long suffered from poor approval ratings after a lackluster first two years in the White House. She is polling largely neck-and-neck with Trump in the polls that have looked at a direct match up.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign - formerly President Joe Biden's campaign - debuted a new logo on Monday, just hours after Biden announced that he would withdraw from the presidential race and endorse her 2024 bid.</p>

<p>In an email touting the slew of Democratic officials and lawmakers backing Ms Harris, the campaign - which is still operating from its joebiden.com domain - unveiled the new logo, which features "Harris for President," in the same font used in its original logo.</p>

<p>The website also featured the new logo on its online merchandise shop, along with new items featuring Ms Harris' likeness, CNN reported.</p>

<p>A spokesperson for the campaign confirmed that the new logo is the campaign's official logo moving forward.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, former secretary of state Hillary Clinton posted a fundraising appeal for Ms Harris' campaign Monday, urging supporters to "become a part of this historic campaign today." "I've known Kamala Harris a long time," Ms Clinton wrote on X about the 59-year-old US vice president, who is now poised to be the Democratic Party's presidential nominee in the November 5 election.</p>

<p>"This brilliant prosecutor will make the case against convicted felon Donald Trump and the Project 2025 agenda to take away our freedoms," she wrote.</p>

<p>"But she can't do it alone. Become a part of this historic campaign today," the post said.</p>

<p>Ms Clinton spoke with Ms Harris on Sunday as part of the more than 10 hours she spent working the phones to rally support from Democratic leaders after Biden, 81, said he will not seek re-election.</p>

<p>Both Ms Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, endorsed Ms Harris in a joint statement Sunday.</p>

<p>Vice President Kamala Harris raised USD 49.6 million in grassroots donations for her campaign after President Joe Biden endorsed her, CNN quoted campaign spokesperson Lauren Hitt as saying.</p>

<p>Also on Sunday, the Democratic online fundraising platform ActBlue said: "This has been the biggest fundraising day of the 2024 cycle."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Russian court has sentenced US-Russian journalist Alsu Alsu Kurmasheva to more than six years in prison for violating military censorship laws, a court spokesperson said Monday, a ruling her employer slammed as a "mockery of justice".</p>

<p>Alsu Kurmasheva, 47, was convicted on Friday -- the same day a separate Russian court sentenced US journalist Evan Gershkovich for 16 years on espionage charges, also rejected as baseless -- but the details were not made public until Monday.</p>

<p>"On Friday, Alsu Kurmasheva was sentenced. Six years, six months," Natalya Loseva, a spokesperson for the Supreme Court of Tatarstan, told AFP.</p>

<p>The court's website states only that she had been found guilty in a hearing on Friday, with no details of the sentence.</p>

<p>Alsu Kurmasheva, an editor with the US-funded Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) outlet in Prague, was arrested last year while travelling to Russia for a family emergency.</p>

<p>She had her passports confiscated for not declaring her dual citizenship, was then arrested for not registering as a "foreign agent" and while in pre-trial detention was hit with the more serious "false information" charge.</p>

<p>The sentencing was slammed by RFE/RL.</p>

<p>"This secret trial and conviction make a mockery of justice," RFE/RL President and CEO Stephen Capus told AFP in an emailed statement.</p>

<p>"The only just outcome is for Alsu Kurmasheva to be immediately released from prison by her Russian captors. It's beyond time for this American citizen, our dear colleague, to be reunited with her loving family."</p>

<p>Russia often holds trials behind closed doors, but issuing a verdict and sentencing in such a manner is extremely unorthodox.</p>

<p>Gershkovich was also convicted in a fast-track trial after spending more than a year in prison.</p>

<p>The speed of the process raised hopes among allies that Washington and Moscow could be close to agreeing a prisoner exchange, as the Kremlin has previously said it will only enter such a deal after a conviction.</p>

<p>Washington and Moscow have both said negotiations for Gershkovich, a Wall Street Journal reporter, are ongoing, though the fate of Alsu Kurmasheva, as a dual US-Russian citizen, has been less clear.</p>

<p>Her employer and family have been pushing for her release.</p>

<p>Alsu Kurmasheva edited a 2022 book titled "Saying No to War", which is a collection of interviews and stories from Russians opposed to the military campaign against Ukraine ordered by President Vladimir Putin.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US Vice President Kamala Harris raced Monday to lock in Democratic support and secure the party's nomination to take on Donald Trump in November after President Joe Biden's sensational exit.</p>

<p>Armed with Biden's endorsement, the 59-year-old has quickly won the backing of a flood of Democrats as she prepares to kick off her first full day of campaigning with an event at the White House.</p>

<p>Kamala&nbsp;Harris must still win over some key hold-outs if she is to wrap up the nomination, which could happen as quickly as August 1, while some Democrats are still calling for the party to show transparency with an open primary.</p>

<p>America's first female, Black and South Asian vice president also has a unique opportunity to unify the party, after 81-year-old Biden's historic decision to step aside from the nomination plunged the race into uncharted waters.</p>

<p>The stunning development has brought a jolt of energy to a demoralized party, transformed an election that threatened to turn into a long slog between two unpopular old men, and could give America its first female president.</p>

<p>Kamala&nbsp;Harris spent more than 10 hours Sunday placing calls to over 100 party leaders, members of Congress, governors and other figures, a person familiar with her schedule said.</p>

<p>"On each of those calls, the vice president made clear that she was extremely grateful for the president's endorsement, but plans to work hard to earn the Democratic nomination in her own right," the person said.</p>

<p>She reportedly spoke to former president Barack Obama, one of those who notably held back from endorsing her on Sunday.</p>

<p><strong>'Threat to democracy'</strong></p>

<p>The party has promised a "transparent and orderly process" to replace Biden, who bowed Sunday to Democratic concerns over his age and mental acuity following a disastrous debate performance against Trump.</p>

<p>One possible rival, the independent senator Joe Manchin who has long been a thorn in Biden's side, on Monday ruled out registering as a Democrat and standing against her.</p>

<p>Her campaign said it had raised a stunning $49.6 million in grassroots donations in less than 24 hours since Biden endorsed her on Sunday.</p>

<p>Biden's withdrawal has also upended 78-year-old Trump's election campaign, which was in large part built around attacking Biden as too old.</p>

<p>Kamala&nbsp;Harris' entry not only flips the age issue but puts Trump -- a convicted felon who has faced a series of legal cases over sexual assault -- up against a woman and former prosecutor.</p>

<p>Trump launched a series of invective-filled social media posts after Biden quit, mocking his age and saying he and Kamala&nbsp;Harris posed a "threat to democracy."</p>

<p>The challenges facing Kamala&nbsp;Harris remain daunting in a lightening-fast process</p>

<p>And the vice president has long suffered from poor approval ratings after a lackluster first two years in the White House and she is polling largely neck-and-neck with Trump in the few polls that have looked at a direct match up. That, however, could change as she campaigns, taking charge of her own image for the first time.</p>

<p>Potential convention delegates were being told to expect a vote on August 1 to put Kamala&nbsp;Harris's name formally atop the ticket, more than two weeks before the gathering, CBS reported.</p>

<p>Calls for a contested convention in Chicago starting on August 19 have been muted so far, with potential challengers such as popular California governor Gavin Newsom backing Kamala&nbsp;Harris. Popular Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear also publicly backed Kamala&nbsp;Harris on Monday, adding to speculation that he might be picked for the new vice presidential spot.</p>

<p><strong>'Greatest honor'</strong></p>

<p>Democratic lawmakers and party elders, including at least a third of US senators, some key governors, and Bill and Hillary Clinton, have already rallied behind Kamala&nbsp;Harris.</p>

<p>But many big names -- including Obama, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and his influential predecessor Nancy Pelosi to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer -- were initially holding back.</p>

<p>The Democratic ticket has been in disarray since Biden's dismal debate performance in June, with Republicans coalescing around Trump after the attempt on his life at a rally in Pennsylvania eight days ago.</p>

<p>Biden spent more than three weeks resisting calls to step down but then dropped his bombshell as he recovered from Covid at his Delaware beach house.</p>

<p>The veteran Democrat said it had been the "greatest honor of my life" to be president and promised to address the nation later this week, offering his "full support and endorsement" for Kamala&nbsp;Harris.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hunter Biden has dropped his lawsuit against right-wing Fox News, filed after the US broadcaster used nude images of him in a fictional drama concerning the president's son, court filings showed.</p>

<p>The voluntary dismissal came on Sunday, the day Joe Biden ended his reelection campaign.</p>

<p>"The Trial of Hunter Biden" was made up of six episodes published in 2022 on Fox Nation, the conservative broadcaster's online platform owned by the family of media mogul Rupert Murdoch.</p>

<p>A dramatized version of a criminal trial, the series contained a warning that the proceedings were fiction, depicting Hunter Biden being prosecuted for graft -- dovetailing with real-life accusations made for years by Donald Trump supporters who point to his past business ties with Ukraine and China.</p>

<p>Those accusations have never led to legal action.</p>

<p>Hunter Biden sued the platform earlier this month alleging that the use of real nude images of him as part of the series amounted to "revenge porn."</p>

<p>The images originated from a laptop that Hunter Biden dropped off at a computer repair shop, but which he never collected.</p>

<p>Its contents have been circulating ever since, and have been the subject of widespread conspiracy theories as well as embarrassing fodder for the political opposition.</p>

<p>"This entirely politically motivated lawsuit is devoid of merit," Fox News said in a statement at the time.</p>

<p>"Mr. Biden did not complain about (it) until sending a letter in late April 2024. The program was removed within days of the letter, in an abundance of caution."</p>

<p>Hunter Biden's lawyers did not specify why they dropped the lawsuit in their court filings.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ayres Sasaki, a 35-year-old Brazilian rock singer, died of electrocution during a live performance on July 13, as per a report in the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/brazilian-singer-ayres-sasaki-electrocution-b2583529.html"><em>Independent</em></a>. The incident took place at the Solar Hotel in Salinopolis. The singer touched a soaking-wet fan, which triggered an electric shock, killing him.</p>

<p>The reason the fan was wet is still unknown, however Salinopolis Police have stated that they are looking into the matter. According to the Brazilian magazine Istoe Gente, the Para Civil Police indicated that witnesses had given testimonies and that authorities have asked for reports from experts.</p>

<p>According to a report by the Brazilian media outlet Diario do Para, Mr Sasaki was electrocuted while playing his guitar, despite the majority of reports indicating that he died after hugging the fan. Solar Hotel took to Instagram to share a statement and said that they are cooperating with the investigation, "Hotel Solar deeply regrets the loss of dear Ayres Sasaki. Since yesterday, we have been entirely dedicated to supporting your family and taking care of the necessary arrangements. We are in direct contact with your family, offering all the support you need at this difficult time."</p>

<p>"We reiterate our commitment to fully collaborate with the competent authorities to provide the necessary clarifications. Our thoughts and condolences are with Ayres Sasaki's family and friends at this difficult time," they added.</p>

<p>Rita Matos, the singer's aunt, told the Brazilian outlet, "We are contacting people who were with him at the moment to understand how everything happened. We will gather all the information in a statement that we will release to the press".</p>

<p>In addition to singing, Mr Sasaki worked as an urban planner. He is survived by his wife. The couple got married 11 months ago. His wife Mariana posted a message on her Instagram Stories and said, "I would like to thank you for every message of affection and comfort, for every prayer during this difficult time that we are going through. I haven't been able to read all the messages yet, but as I feel better, I will respond to each one. Thank you."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An Emirati court has sentenced 57 Bangladeshi expatriates to lengthy prison terms for protesting against their government in the Gulf country, where demonstrations are banned, state media reported Monday.</p>

<p>Protests have swept Bangladesh this month against a quota system for civil service jobs that critics say benefits supporters of autocratic Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.</p>

<p>In Bangladesh, near-daily marches escalated last week into civil unrest, leaving 163 people dead. More than 500 people, including some opposition leaders, have been arrested.</p>

<p>On Monday, the official Emirati news agency WAM said three Bangladeshi expatriates were sentenced to life, 53 others to 10 years in prison and one to 11 years for participating in protests.</p>

<p>The defendants had "gathered and incited riots in several streets across the United Arab Emirates on Friday", WAM said, adding they would be deported after the completion of their prison terms.</p>

<p>The Abu Dhabi Federal Court of Appeal's ruling was made on Sunday after a swift investigation that had been ordered on Friday, WAM reported.</p>

<p>It quoted a witness as saying that "the defendants gathered and organised large-scale marches in several streets of the UAE in protest against decisions made by the Bangladeshi government".</p>

<p>The UAE, an autocratic federation of seven sheikhdoms, is populated mostly by expatriates, many of them South Asians who work as labourers.</p>

<p>Bangladeshis form the third largest expatriate group in the UAE, after Pakistanis and Indians, according to the UAE foreign ministry.</p>

<p>The oil-rich Gulf state bans unauthorised protests and prohibits criticism of rulers or speech that is deemed to create or encourage social unrest.</p>

<p>Defamation, as well as verbal and written insults, whether published or made in private, are punishable by law.</p>

<p>The country's penal code also criminalises offending foreign states or jeopardising ties with them.</p>

<p>The ruling comes weeks after Emirati authorities handed life sentences to 43 Emiratis for "terrorist" links after a mass trial heavily criticised by UN experts and rights groups.</p>

<p>Ten others were jailed for 10 to 15 years on similar charges.</p>

<p>Government critics and human rights activists were among the 84 defendants brought before the Abu Dhabi Federal Court of Appeal, most of whom have been in jail since a similar trial of 94 people in 2013, according to groups say.</p>

<p>Commenting on the Bangladeshi case, Amnesty International's UAE researcher Devin Kenney said it was "the second mass trial in the UAE this month, with dozens of people sentenced to huge prison terms literally overnight, on charges involving no element of violence".</p>

<p>In a statement to AFP, Kenney said the UAE's "extreme reaction to the mere existence of a public protest on Emirati soil shows that the state places great priority on suppressing any manifestation of dissent in the country."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pakistani singer Rahat Fateh Ali Khan today dismissed reports that he was arrested in Dubai. "Not true," said Mr Khan in a video posted on X.</p>

<p>"I am Rahat Fateh Ali Khan, your Rahat Fateh Ali Khan. I came here (to Dubai) to record songs... Everything is fine. I request you not to pay any attention to disgusting rumours. These reports are not true," he said.</p>

<p>"News circulating regarding the arrest of Rahat Fateh Ali Khan is fake and baseless. Regards Team RFAK," read the caption of the video posted by his team.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

— Rahat Fateh Ali Khan (@RFAKWorld) <a href="https://twitter.com/RFAKWorld/status/1815374925760270838?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 22, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p>Several reports claimed that the popular singer was arrested over a defamation complaint by his former manager Salman Ahmed. The reports claimed that Mr Khan had dismissed Mr Ahmed a few months earlier following a dispute.</p>

<p>"You are my power. My audience and fans are my power. After god, my fans are my power," the 49-year-old said in the video message.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The singer hit headlines earlier this year when a video of him hitting a man with shoes surfaced online.&nbsp;In the clip, Mr Khan asked for a bottle from the man, who said that he didn't know about it. The singer replied, "<em>Main tujhe marunga </em>(I will beat you)." In a fit of rage, Mr Khan slapped the individual as he walked out of the room to look for the bottle.</p>

<p>Mr Khan later posted a clarification video alongside the man, who claimed to be the singer's student.&nbsp;They explained that the requested bottle contained holy water from a religious cleric who recited verses over it.&nbsp;"The bottle contained 'holy water' and I forgot where I kept it. He is my teacher, my father," the man said. Mr Khan also claimed that he apologised to the man later.</p>

<p>Rahat Fateh Ali Khan is the nephew of Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan - a world-renowned Qawwali singer. Mr Khan has also sung several popular songs in Hindi cinema.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA["Now we have to start all over again," the 45th President of America wrote on Truth Social.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden dropped out of the forthcoming presidential election on Sunday and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democratic Party's new nominee. The announcement wasn't completely unexpected, especially after pressure mounted on Mr Biden following his poor performance in the first presidential debate last month. Former president Donald Trump on Sunday reacted to Joe Biden ending his re-election bid, claiming the incumbent president is "certainly not fit to serve."</p>

<p>Further, he questioned whether the Republican Party should be "reimbursed for fraud" for the resources and money it spent campaigning against President Joe Biden. "So, we are forced to spend time and money on fighting Crooked Joe Biden, he polls badly after having a terrible debate, and quits the race. Now we have to start all over again," the 45th President of America wrote on Truth Social.</p>

<p><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" class="truthsocial-embed" src="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/112826696160137948/embed" style="max-width: 100%; border: 0" width="600"></iframe><script src="https://truthsocial.com/embed.js" async="async"></script></p>

<p>"Shouldn't the Republican Party be reimbursed for fraud in that everybody around Joe, including his doctors and the Fake News Media, knew he was not capable of running for, or being, President? Just askin'?" he added.</p>

<p>In a letter posted on X, Mr Biden said it had been the "greatest honor of my life" to be president. He said he would address the nation later this week. "While it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term," he wrote.</p>

<p>Later, he offered his "full support and endorsement" for Harris, with his campaign filing official notice to change its name to "Harris for President."</p>

<p>Donald Trump told CNN that he thinks Ms Harris will be easier to defeat than Biden would have been in the November 5 presidential election. The campaign also attacked Mr Biden and Ms Harris on social media saying that Mr Biden was unfit to continue serving as president.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Bangladeshi student group leading demonstrations that have spiralled into deadly violence suspended protests Monday for 48 hours, with its leader saying they had not wanted reform "at the expense of so much blood".</p>

<p>What began as demonstrations against politicised admission quotas for sought-after government jobs snowballed into some of the worst unrest of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's tenure.</p>

<p>A curfew has been imposed and soldiers are patrolling cities across the South Asian country, while a nationwide internet blackout since Thursday has drastically restricted the flow of information to the outside world.</p>

<p>"We are suspending the shutdown protests for 48 hours," Nahid Islam, the top leader of the main protest organiser Students Against Discrimination, told AFP from his hospital bed.</p>

<p>He was being treated for his injuries after being beaten by people he accused of being undercover police, he said.</p>

<p>"We demand that during this period the government withdraws the curfew, restores the internet and stops targeting the student protesters."</p>

<p>On Sunday, the Supreme Court pared back the number of reserved jobs for specific groups, including the descendants of "freedom fighters" from Bangladesh's 1971 liberation war against Pakistan.</p>

<p>"We started this movement for reforming the quota," Islam said.</p>

<p>"But we did not want quota reform at the expense of so much blood, so much killing, so much damage to life and property."</p>

<p>At least 163 people have died in clashes, including several police officers, according to an AFP count of victims reported by police and hospitals.</p>

<p>Sporadic violence continued Monday, with four people brought to the Dhaka Medical College Hospital with bullet injuries, an AFP reporter at the scene saw.</p>

<p>Government officials have repeatedly blamed the protesters and opposition for the unrest.</p>

<p>Dhaka Metropolitan Police spokesman Faruk Hossain told AFP that "at least 532" people had been arrested in the capital since protests began, including some leaders of the opposition Bangladesh National Party.</p>

<p>Ali Riaz, a professor of politics and leading Bangladesh expert at Illinois State University, described the violence as "the worst massacre by any regime since independence".</p>

<p>"The atrocities committed in the past days show that the regime is entirely dependent on brute force and has no regard for the lives of the people," he told AFP.</p>

<p>"These indiscriminate killings cannot be washed by a court ruling or a government announcement."</p>

<p><strong>Diplomatic questions</strong></p>

<p>Bangladeshi Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus urged "world leaders and the United Nations to do everything within their powers to end the violence".</p>

<p>"There must be investigations into the killings that have taken place already," the 83-year-old said in a statement, his first public comments since the unrest began.</p>

<p>The respected economist is credited with lifting millions out of poverty with his pioneering microfinance bank but earned the enmity of Hasina, who has accused him of "sucking blood" from the poor.</p>

<p>"Bangladesh has been engulfed in a crisis that only seems to get worse with each passing day," Yunus said. "High school students have been among the victims."</p>

<p>Diplomats in Dhaka questioned Bangladeshi authorities' deadly response to the protests.</p>

<p>Foreign Minister Hasan Mahmud summoned ambassadors for a briefing on Sunday and showed them a 15-minute video that sources said focused on damage caused by protesters.</p>

<p>US ambassador Peter Haas told Mahmud he was presenting a one-sided version of events, according to a senior diplomatic official.</p>

<p>"I am surprised you did not show the footage of police firing at unarmed protesters," the source quoted Haas as telling the minister.</p>

<p>A US embassy official speaking on condition of anonymity confirmed the ambassador's comments.</p>

<p>The diplomatic source added that Mahmud did not respond to a question from a UN representative about the alleged use of UN-marked armoured personnel carriers and helicopters to suppress the protests.</p>

<p>Bangladesh is a major contributor to UN peacekeeping operations around the world -- earning significant revenues from its efforts -- and has UN-marked equipment in its military inventories.</p>

<p><strong>'Freedom fighter' quota</strong></p>

<p>With around 18 million young people in Bangladesh out of work, according to government figures, the quota scheme's reintroduction deeply upset graduates facing an acute jobs crisis.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court decision curtailed the number of reserved jobs from 56 percent of all positions to seven percent, most of which will still be set aside for the children and grandchildren of "freedom fighters" from the 1971 war.</p>

<p>While 93 percent of jobs will be awarded on merit, the decision fell short of protesters' demands to scrap the "freedom fighter" category altogether.</p>

<p>Critics say the quota is used to stack public jobs with loyalists to Hasina's ruling Awami League.</p>

<p>Opponents accuse her government of bending the judiciary to its will.</p>

<p>Hasina, 76, has ruled the country since 2009 and won her fourth consecutive election in January after a vote without genuine opposition.</p>

<p>Her government is also accused by rights groups of misusing state institutions to entrench its hold on power and stamp out dissent, including by the extrajudicial killing of opposition activists.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Ivanka Trump, the daughter of Mr Trump, further donated $2,000 to Senator Harris' campaign in 2014, according to The Washington Post.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden dropped out of the forthcoming presidential election on Sunday and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democratic Party's new nominee. The announcement wasn't completely unexpected, especially after pressure mounted on Mr Biden following his poor performance in the first presidential debate last month. Amid this, former President Donald Trump's past donation to Kamala Harris' campaigns is going viral on social media.</p>

<p>The 45th President of the US donated twice to the campaigns of his potential presidential opponent. Financial records show that on September 26, 2011, and February 20, 2013, when Ms Harris was a candidate for California attorney general, Mr Trump gave $5,000 and $1,000 to her campaigns, respectively.</p>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Ivanka Trump, the daughter of Mr Trump, further donated $2,000 to Senator Harris' campaign in 2014, according to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/biden-drops-out-election-2024/card/donald-trump-donated-thousands-to-kamala-harris-2uSNrJk08BdtPmwGPmEG"><em>The Washington Post</em></a>. A representative for Ms Harris clarified that she did not ask Trump for the donation. According to a 2020 Sacramento Bee report, Ms Harris gave the funds to a nonprofit organisation that "advocates for civil and human rights for Central Americans" during the start of Trump's presidential campaign.</p>

<p>As per a report in <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-donated-kamala-harris-1928209"><em>Newsweek</em></a>, Mr Trump used to donate heavily to Democrats at that time. He also gave then-senator Joe Biden's campaign $1,000 in 2001. In 2002, he donated $5,000 to the New York State Democratic Party.</p>

<p>Mr Trump also donated $10,000 to Andrew Cuomo in support of his candidacy for attorney general of New York in 2006 and $15,000 to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. In 2010, he backed Kristen Gillibrand's campaign for the US Senate.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mr Trump made multiple donations to the campaigns of his future opponent Hillary Clinton, including two contributions of $2,100 and $200, respectively, in 2006 and an additional $600 in 2007, according to OpenSecrets. Additionally, the non-profit organisation claims that he gave the Clinton Foundation at least $100,000 in donations.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Paris Olympics have been designed to showcase the City of Light in all its splendour, with events taking place at iconic locations.</p>

<p>AFP looks at five sites set to wow ticket-holders -- and a global TV audience of billions -- during the 17-day extravaganza starting on July 26:</p>

<p><strong>Eiffel Tower</strong></p>

<p>The most famous of the Paris landmarks, the Eiffel Tower, will welcome beach volleyball.</p>

<p>The action will take place in a temporary venue near the foot of the "Iron Lady".</p>

<p>Next door, the Champs de Mars park at the foot of the tower will host judo and wrestling.</p>

<p>Reviled by some Parisians when it was unveiled in 1889 for the World Fair by engineer Gustave Eiffel, the Eiffel Tower has become the capital's symbol.</p>

<p>Besides being one of the world's top tourist attractions, pulling in seven million visitors a year, it is also a working telecoms tower, used for radio and TV transmissions.</p>

<p>Winners at the Paris Games will all go home with a small part of the iron colossus. Each medal will contain an 18g crumb of original iron, removed during renovations, melted down and reforged.</p>

<p><strong>Grand Palais</strong></p>

<p>Fencing and taekwondo battles will take place in the opulent setting of the Grand Palais exhibition hall, a glass-and-steel masterpiece created for the World Fair of 1900.</p>

<p>Its distinctive feature is its glass domed roof, the largest of its kind in Europe, which covers a cavernous exhibition space of 13,500 square metres.</p>

<p>During World War I, the Grand Palais put its art collection in storage and converted its galleries into a military hospital where soldiers were patched up before returning to the trenches.</p>

<p>In the 21st century, the airy nave has hosted giant installations commissioned from some of the world's leading artists.</p>

<p>It has also been flooded to make the biggest ice rink in the world.</p>

<p><strong>Place de la Concorde</strong></p>

<p>The vast, paved square at the foot of the Champs-Elysees avenue, where heads rolled (literally) during the French Revolution, will serve as an urban sports hub.</p>

<p>Skateboarding, 3x3 basketball, BMX freestyle and, in its first Games appearance, breakdancing, will all take place on the elegant square by the Seine.</p>

<p>Its harmonious name conceals a bloody past. King Louis XVI and his wife Marie-Antoinette were guillotined there in 1793 during the Reign of Terror that followed the 1789 French Revolution.</p>

<p>The largest square in Paris is defined by its huge gold obelisk, one of a pair originally erected by Ramses II outside the temple in Luxor in Egypt. It was gifted to Paris in 1830.</p>

<p><strong>Palace of Versailles</strong></p>

<p>Dressage, showjumping and equestrian cross country will take place in the park of Versailles Palace, some 20 kilometres from Paris. It also feature on the marathon circuit and host pentathlon events.</p>

<p>In the 17th century, "the Sun King" Louis XIV transformed Versailles into a home of French royalty, where he resided with around 10,000 staff.</p>

<p>The vast gardens include a mile-long canal that once hosted opulent parties.</p>

<p>It has been a world heritage site since 1979 and is a firm favourite on the Paris tourist trail.</p>

<p><strong>Marseille</strong></p>

<p>The Olympics are spreading beyond the capital.</p>

<p>Sailing contests will take place in the Mediterranean city of Marseille, France's boisterous second city, better known as the home of Olympique Marseille football team.</p>

<p>Over 300 sailors from across the world will battle it out on the sapphire Mediterranean waters off the city. A marina has been built along the scenic Corniche coastal road heading southeast out of the city.</p>

<p>It's unlikely they'll have the sometimes ferocious mistral wind in their sails. It usually blows in winter and spring.</p>

<p>Marseille, which will also host 10 football matches, was where the Olympic torch landed in France on May 8 on its relay to Paris.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Kremlin said Monday it had noted the "unfriendly rhetoric" against Russia used by US Vice President, Kamala Harris, the frontrunner to replace Joe Biden in the US presidential election.</p>

<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin said previously that Moscow would prefer Biden over Donald Trump, calling the Democrat "more predictable."</p>

<p>Asked what the Kremlin made of Harris now looking likely to become the Democrats' candidate, Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: "There have been some statements which were full of unfriendly rhetoric towards our country."</p>

<p>He did specify what comments he was referring to.</p>

<p>Harris, like Biden, has been a staunch backer of Ukraine since Russia launched its full-scale military offensive in February 2022.</p>

<p>Earlier this year she said the death of opposition leader Alexei Navalny in an Arctic prison was "a further sign of Putin's brutality."</p>

<p>She has also called Russia's actions in Ukraine "horrendous atrocities," "gruesome," "barbaric," and "inhumane."</p>

<p>Peskov said Monday that Moscow could not "assess Harris's potential candidacy from the point of view of our bilateral relations, because so far we have not noticed her contribution to our bilateral relations."</p>

<p>Other than her "unfriendly" statements, Peskov said: "We have not recorded anything she's done in terms of our bilateral relations, either positively or negatively."</p>

<p>Biden on Sunday endorsed Harris to replace him in the presidential election, shortly after he announced he was dropping out with under four months to go until the vote.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Brett Clibbery and Sarah Packwood embarked across the Atlantic Ocean, sailing from Halifax to the Azores in their self-built, eco-friendly yacht, Theros.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A British-Canadian couple, who set sail across the Atlantic Ocean roughly six weeks ago, were found dead in a lifeboat off the coast of Canada. The bodies of Brett Clibbery and Sarah Packwood were discovered after their raft washed ashore on Sable Island, off the coast of Nova Scotia, reported the&nbsp;<a href="https://nypost.com/2024/07/21/world-news/theories-emerge-on-brett-clibbery-and-sarah-packwood-deaths/ ">NY Post</a>.</p>

<p>The pair had embarked on an ambitious journey across the Atlantic Ocean, sailing from Halifax to the Azores in their self-built, eco-friendly yacht, Theros. The 42-foot vessel, powered solely by electric, wind, and solar energy, was intended to demonstrate the feasibility of sustainable travel. The couple had been posting about the construction of Theros on their YouTube channel, "Theros Adventures," and this voyage was to be their inaugural fully "green" journey.</p>

<p>They left Halifax Harbour on June 11 aboard their yacht bound for the Azores region of Portugal. They were reported missing on June 18 and found three weeks later on July 10.</p>

<p>While initially reported to be from British Columbia, it is believed that Ms Packwood was from the UK and Mr Clibbery was from Canada. Formal identification is still pending.</p>

<p>The cause of death is not yet known. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police are investigating the incident.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Their sailboat, Theros, was severely damaged, and investigators suspected that it was struck by a larger vessel.</p>

<p>The area they were sailing in is notoriously known as the "Graveyard of the Atlantic" due to the large number of shipwrecks that occurred there. The exact circumstances of the incident are still unknown, but investigators are exploring several theories.</p>

<p>One leading theory is that Theros was hit by a bulk carrier, which may have caused significant damage to the sailboat. Investigators have inspected a carrier ship, which was in the same area as Theros at the time of the incident, but they have not released their findings, as per the <a href="https://www.saltwire.com/atlantic-canada/news/ship-may-have-collided-with-couples-sailboat-off-nova-scotia-says-source-they-cant-be-positive-100979604/ ">Saltwire</a>.</p>

<p>The crew of the carrier ship reported that they did not notice any damage or collision, the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/expert-theory-what-caused-deaths-33289850 ">Mirror</a>&nbsp;reported. Some veteran sailors have suggested the homemade additions to Theros may have contributed to the tragedy, particularly the excessive weight of batteries and solar panels, which may have destabilised the boat.</p>

<p>Brett Clibbery and Sarah Packwood met by chance in 2015 at a bus stop in London. At the time, Ms Packwood was preparing to donate a kidney to her sister, while Mr Clibbery was visiting from Canada. This chance encounter led to them eventually falling in love and getting married on their yacht, Theros, in 2016.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>State Democratic party chairs on Sunday threw their weight behind Vice President Kamala Harris to be the party's new presidential nominee to run against Republican nominee and former president, Donald Trump.</p>

<p>The chairs held a conference call after President Joe Biden announced he was stepping aside as the party's candidate.</p>

<p>“Following President Biden's announcement, our members immediately assembled to unite behind the candidate who has a track record of winning tough elections, and who is a proven leader on the issues that matter to Americans: reproductive freedom, gun violence prevention, climate protection, justice reform, and rebuilding the economy," said Ken Martin, president of the Association of State Democratic Committees, in a statement.</p>

<p>"That person is our sitting Vice President Kamala Harris."</p>

<p>Reuters reported earlier that the group had backed the vice president, with one source saying there was "full support" for her being at the top of the ticket.</p>

<p>Many Democrats quickly backed Harris to run as the party's presidential nominee against Trump in the November election, but some powerful party members, including former House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, stayed quiet.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Polls show the race remains close, but Harris is moving slightly ahead - a remarkable turn of events, given that only a month ago Trump seemed to be gaining a steadily tightening grip over Joe Biden.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pop megastar Taylor Swift on Wednesday broke her silence about the cancellation of three Vienna concerts over an alleged suicide attack plot, saying the incident filled her with "fear" and "guilt."<br />
"Having our Vienna shows cancelled was devastating. The reason for the cancellations filled me with a new sense of fear, and a tremendous amount of guilt because so many had planned on coming to those shows," the American said in a post on social media platform Instagram.</p>

<p>The Vienna shows, part of the European leg of Swift's record-breaking "Eras" tour, were cancelled after authorities warned of a terror plot by sympathizers of the Islamic State armed group.</p>

<p>Police have detained three suspects over the alleged attack threat, with the United States saying it shared intelligence to assist in the investigation.</p>

<p>The main suspect, a 19-year-old Austrian with North Macedonian roots, had allegedly confessed, saying he "intended to carry out an attack using explosives and knives," according to Austrian domestic intelligence agency (DSN) head Omar Haijawi-Pirchner.</p>

<p>In the social media post Wednesday, Swift thanked the authorities.</p>

<p>"I was also so grateful to the authorities because thanks to them, we were grieving concerts and not lives. I was heartened by the love and unity I saw in the fans who banded together," she said.</p>

<p>The European leg of Swift's sold-out tour began in Paris in May and has taken in Sweden, Portugal, Spain, Britain, Ireland, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Italy, Germany and Poland.</p>

<p>It concluded on Tuesday with five shows at London's Wembley stadium.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 24-year-old woman in the United States has been sentenced to 11 years in prison after pleading guilty to second-degree reckless homicide in the killing of a man who she said trafficked her as a teenager. According to <em>CNN</em>, Chrystul Kizer was sentenced on Monday. She will also serve five years of parole. She must submit a DNA sample to authorities and attend a restitution hearing later. "The 11 years is minus ... 570 days because she has served those awaiting trial," Kenosha County District Attorney Michael Graveley told the outlet.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ms Kizer shot 34-year-old Randall Volar at his Kenosha, Wisconsin, home in 2018 when she was 17 years old. She shot him in the head, burned his house down and stole his BMW. She was initially charged with multiple counts, including first-degree intentional homicide, arson, car theft and being a felon in possession of a firearm, per the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://amp-cnn-com.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/amp.cnn.com/cnn/2024/08/19/us/chrystul-kizer-sentencing-sex-trafficking-death?amp_js_v=0.1&amp;amp_gsa=1#webview=1&amp;cap=swipe">outlet</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ms Kizer was 16 when she met Volar. She alleged that he had sexually abused her multiple times. The prosecutor's office also confirmed that it was working on a case against Volar at the time of his death. But prosecutors also said that Ms Kizer didn't give any indication at the time of the killing that she was trafficked by Volar.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a 2019 interview with<em> The Washington Post</em>, Ms Kizer said that in 2018 she went to Volar's house with a gun in her purse that she said her boyfriend gave her for protection. She alleged that while she was there, Volar gave her a drug and the two decided to watch a movie. They then began to fight after Volar began touching her and she refused to have sex with her, she alleged.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ms Kizer also said that Volar pinned her before she shot him twice. She then set Volar's body on fire and fled in his car. "I just thought that I didn't want to do that stuff anymore because I was trying to change," she said.</p>

<p>Kenosha District Attorney Michael D. Graveley accused Ms Kizer of premeditated murder, alleging she planned to steal Volar's BMW. In 2022, she had a legal victory when the state Supreme Court upheld a ruling that she could argue she acted in self-defence under a state law that allows victims of trafficking to present "an affirmative defence for any offence committed as a direct result" of being trafficked. She was released from prison earlier this year on a $400,000 bond when she fled the state, violating the conditions of her bail. She was caught two weeks later in Louisiana and was returned to Wisconsin.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Senior officials from the U.S. State Department and the White House met with the Dalai Lama in New York on Wednesday and "reaffirmed the U.S. commitment to advancing the human rights of Tibetans," the State Department said.</p>

<p>The meeting with the 89-year-old exiled spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhism will likely irritate China, which considers him a dangerous separatist and opposes contact by officials of any country with him.</p>

<p>The Dalai Lama, who fled to India in 1959 after a failed uprising against Chinese rule in Tibet, traveled to New York in June for medical treatment on his knees, his first visit to the United States since 2017.</p>

<p>A State Department statement said Uzra Zeya, the U.S. undersecretary of state for human rights and special coordinator for Tibetan issues, traveled to New York for an audience with the Dalai Lama, joined by the White House director for human rights, Kelly Razzouk.</p>

<p>It said Zeya "conveyed, on behalf of President Biden, best wishes for His Holiness's good health and reaffirmed the U.S. commitment to advancing the human rights of Tibetans and supporting efforts to preserve their distinct historical, linguistic, cultural, and religious heritage."</p>

<p>Zeya discussed U.S. efforts to address human rights abuses in Tibet and support for a resumption of dialogue between China and the Dalai Lama, the statement said.</p>

<p>A group of U.S. lawmakers met the Dalai Lama in India before his U.S. trip and said they would not allow China to influence the choice of his successor.</p>

<p>Last month, China expressed strong opposition to a U.S. law signed by President Joe Biden that presses Beijing to resolve a dispute over Tibet's demands for greater autonomy and vowed to "firmly defend" its interests.</p>

<p>The Dalai Lama has met U.S. officials, including U.S. presidents, during previous visits to the U.S., but Biden has not met him since taking office in 2021.</p>

<p>In 2020, Biden criticized then President Donald Trump for being the only president in three decades who had not met or spoken with the Tibetan spiritual leader, calling it "disgraceful."</p>

<p>Wednesday's meeting comes at a time when Biden has sought to stabilize rocky ties with China ahead of a presidential election on Nov. 5, in which Vice President Kamala Harris is pitted against Trump.</p>

<p>China's embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the meeting.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Elon Musk's brain technology startup Neuralink said its implant, designed to allow paralyzed patients to use digital devices by thinking alone, is working well in a second trial patient.</p>

<p>The company said the patient, identified as Alex, did not face issues of "thread retraction", unlike Noland Arbaugh, Neuralink's first patient who received the implant in January.</p>

<p>The tiny wires of the implant retracted post surgery for Arbaugh, resulting in a sharp reduction in the electrodes that could measure brain signals. The threads have stabilized for Arbaugh, Neuralink said.</p>

<p>Reuters had reported Neuralink was aware of this issue from its animal trials.</p>

<p>The company said on Wednesday it implemented measures such as reduction in the motion of the brain during surgery as well as limiting the gap between the implant and the surface of the brain to prevent similar issues in its second patient.</p>

<p>Neuralink is in the process of testing its device, which is intended to help people with spinal cord injuries. The device has allowed the first patient to play video games, browse the internet, post on social media and move a cursor on his laptop.</p>

<p>Last month, the company successfully implanted the device in the second patient, who has been using the device to play video games and learn how to design 3D objects.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier and accompanying destroyers have arrived in the Middle East, the US military said Wednesday, after the country's defense secretary ordered the strike group to accelerate its speed.</p>

<p>The carrier's arrival brings the number in the region to two -- at least temporarily, as the Lincoln is to replace the USS Theodore Roosevelt -- at a time of heightened fears of regional conflict following high-profile assassinations claimed by, or blamed on, Israel.</p>

<p>"USS Abraham Lincoln (CVN 72), equipped with F-35C and F/A-18 Block III fighters, entered the US Central Command (USCENTCOM) area of responsibility," the military command responsible for the Middle East said on social media.</p>

<p>"The USS Abraham Lincoln (CVN 72), the flagship of Carrier Strike Group 3, is accompanied by Destroyer Squadron (DESRON) 21 and Carrier Air Wing (CVW) 9," it added.</p>

<p>The Pentagon said on August 11 that US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin had ordered the Lincoln to "accelerate its transit" to the Middle East, after directing its deployment to the region at the beginning of the month.</p>

<p>Fears of a major escalation have mounted since Hezbollah and Iran vowed to respond to twin killings blamed on Israel late last month.</p>

<p>An Israeli strike on Beirut's southern suburbs killed a top Hezbollah commander, Fuad Shukr, shortly before an attack in Tehran blamed on Israel killed Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump held his first outdoor campaign event on Wednesday since an assassination attempt, lobbing insults at his surging Democratic opponent Kamala Harris from behind bulletproof glass at a rally in the battleground state of North Carolina.</p>

<p>Trump, 78, speaking against a backdrop of vintage warplanes at an aviation museum, called Harris the "most radical left person" ever to run for the White House and claimed that millions of jobs will "vanish overnight" if she wins in November.</p>

<p>"Your life savings will be totally wiped out," the Republican candidate told the crowd, one of a number of apocalyptic scenarios he painted during his speech.</p>

<p>"All over the world, our adversaries knew that America was not to be trifled with when I was your commander in chief," Trump said. "If comrade Kamala wins this November, World War III is virtually guaranteed to happen."</p>

<p>With Harris drawing enthusiastic crowds since replacing Joe Biden at the top of the Democratic ticket, the event in Asheboro was a chance for Trump to reclaim his longtime dominance in staging spectacular rallies.</p>

<p>It was his first big outdoor event since being lightly wounded in an attempted assassination at a similarly open site in Butler, Pennsylvania, a month ago.</p>

<p>That attack left one rally participant dead before the 20-year-old gunman was killed by a Secret Service sniper.</p>

<p>The Secret Service recommended that Trump stick to more easily controllable indoor venues such as sports arenas. He has since held about a dozen indoor events.</p>

<p>The Secret Service does not comment publicly on security operations and did not respond to requests for comment on Wednesday's preparations.</p>

<p>A bulletproof screen could be seen around the podium where Trump and his vice presidential pick, J.D. Vance, addressed the crowd in Asheboro.</p>

<p>At one point during his speech, Trump left the stage and entered the crowd to check on an attendee who was suffering a medical issue.</p>

<p>Crowds are an integral part of Trump's political brand, with the right-wing billionaire seeking to portray himself as an outsider and man of the people.</p>

<p>Even as president, he kept up a steady schedule of election-style rallies, often filling sports arenas with at least 10,000 people.</p>

<p>He had counted on these demonstrations of strength as a key weapon in his plan to make the 81-year-old Biden, whose own public events were generally low-key and relatively small-scale affairs, look ineffectual.</p>

<p>- Trump's strategy upended -</p>

<p>Trump's strategy was upended on July 21, however, when Biden abruptly dropped his reelection bid and endorsed his 59-year-old vice president as the future of the Democratic Party.</p>

<p>The immediate explosion of Democratic support for Harris appears to have stunned the Trump campaign.</p>

<p>Nowhere is the shift in momentum more visible than in Harris's ability to pack arenas.</p>

<p>She is consistently filling venues with well over 10,000 people. On Tuesday night, supporters packed the Democratic National Convention in Chicago while she hosted a mass rally of her own in Milwaukee.</p>

<p>In a clear dig at Trump, her Milwaukee event took place in the same arena that the Republicans had used for their convention back in July.</p>

<p>North Carolina is one of a handful of swing states that are expected to determine the outcome of the November 5 election.</p>

<p>US presidential elections are not decided by an overall national vote but state-by-state, with each state worth varying amounts of Electoral College votes. The winning candidate needs to win a majority of the Electoral College.</p>

<p>Most states trend solidly Republican or firmly Democrat, and only around seven are considered true toss-ups where the race is really fought -- and where the candidates spend most of their campaigning time and money.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The 2024 Democratic National Convention continues today with Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, the running mate of Vice President and Democratic nominee Kamala Harris, set to deliver the keynote address. As the convention enters its third day, anticipation is high for Walz's speech.</p>

<p>In addition to Walz, prominent figures such as former President Bill Clinton, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries are speaking at the convention. Wednesday's theme is "A Fight for Our Freedoms," where Democrats will emphasise the importance of Harris as a defender of American freedoms and argue that former President Donald Trump poses a significant threat to the nation.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, former President Barack Obama and former First Lady Michelle Obama captivated the audience with their powerful speeches, receiving standing ovations. In his remarks, Obama criticised Trump, stating that the US cannot afford another four years of chaos.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[The second day of the Democratic National Convention saw the Obamas slamming Donald Trump and calling him a "liar". The third day will witness the Vice President pick, Tim Walz, star at the convention.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<ol>
	<li>Tim Walz, the Governor from Minnesota, will accept the nomination to be Kamala Harris's White House running mate.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>The former National Guard officer has been making a name for himself as one of the Democrats' most effective communicators, with his criticism of Trump and running mate J.D. Vance as "weird" going viral shortly before Harris entered the race.</li>
	<li>The chemistry between Harris and Walz and the noise energy generated at their rallies is helping to fuel Democratic hopes that they can defeat Trump in November.</li>
	<li>On Day 2, Michelle Obama highlighted Kamala Harris' background, highlighting her multi-racial origin as "the embodiment of stories we speak about (in) this country. "Her story is your story. It is my story," she said, in response to jibes by Donald Trump.</li>
	<li>Her counterattacks were brief but packed a punch, and included a sarcastic dig at the twice-impeached former President for running for "one of those Black jobs".</li>
	<li>Her husband and former US President Barack Obama came with the second punch against Trump and said, "Here is a 78-year-old billionaire who has not stopped whining about his problems since he rode down his golden elevator nine years ago," Mr Obama said. "It has been a constant gripe, conspiracy theories and grievance that has been getting worse since he is afraid of losing to Kamala."</li>
	<li>Kamala Harris will make a big speech on August 22, the last day of the event, but one of the notable speakers yesterday will be her husband, Doug Emhoff, a successful lawyer. If Harris wins, then Emhoff will be the first "first gentleman" of the United States.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Mr Emhoof cheered for his wife and said "She brings both joy and toughness to this task. At this moment in our nation's history, she is exactly the right president."</li>
	<li>The convention served as a farewell for Joe Biden, who withdrew his nomination in an unprecedented move witnessed in modern US electoral history. In 1968, President Lyndon B Johnson declared in the middle of the Vietnam War that he would not run for re-election.</li>
	<li>On day one, President Biden criticised Mr Trump's "America First" doctrine, which he said had damaged the nation's global image, contrasting his own administration's efforts to unite Europe and counter Russian aggression.</li>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tim Walz will officially accept the nomination to be Kamala Harris's White House running mate Wednesday as he presses a charm offensive that has made him a darling of the Democratic National Convention.</p>

<p>The relatively unknown Minnesota governor brings an earthy, Midwestern vibe to Harris's surging campaign against Donald Trump.</p>

<p>Taking the stage ahead of Harris's big night on Thursday, former school teacher and National Guard soldier Walz will emphasize his "small town values" and "lifetime of service," said Alex Hornbrook, a convention organizer.</p>

<p>"The coach is going to coach tonight," said Democratic National Committee chairman Jaime Harrison on CNN, referring to Walz's days coaching a high-school football team.</p>

<p>With former president Bill Clinton as an opener, Walz will tee up Harris's Thursday speech and the climax of a convention that has defied predictions of disunity or even chaos in the wake of President Joe Biden's decision to drop his reelection bid on July 21.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, it was Democratic superstars Michelle and former president Barack Obama who spoke, following up on Biden's emotional speech Monday, where he passed the torch to his vice president, then both figuratively and literally left the stage.</p>

<p>The convention has seen intense enthusiasm, reflecting Democrats' relief after an extraordinary month in which the party went from despair over 81-year-old Biden's stumbling campaign to giddy excitement at Harris's rebranding.</p>

<p>A big part of that change in atmosphere has been due to Walz, who is getting chants of "Tim! Tim! Tim!" and requests for selfies at the convention.</p>

<p>He has made a name for himself as an able communicator and is credited with coming up with one of the sharpest attack lines on Trump and his running mate J.D. Vance, whom he labeled "weird."</p>

<p>As a folksy, white Midwesterner, Walz balances Harris's California background and barrier-breaking status as the first Black woman nominee.</p>

<p>Walz, 60, will likely speak of his upbringing in small-town Nebraska, where he worked on the family farm, and describe his military service, his experiences as a teacher and his record in politics.</p>

<p>"He's that uncle that you just want to hang out with," Harrison said.</p>

<h3><strong>Battle of the rallies</strong></h3>

<p>The chemistry between 59-year-old Harris and Walz and the noisy energy generated at their rallies is helping to fuel Democratic hopes that they can defeat Trump, 78, in November.</p>

<p>Polls show the race remains close, but Harris is moving slightly ahead -- a remarkable turn of events, given that only a month ago Trump seemed to be gaining a steadily tightening grip over Biden.</p>

<p>Exhibit number one in that shift has been Harris's ability to pack arenas in a way that for years Trump had touted as evidence of his seemingly unique political strength.</p>

<p>In a dramatic gesture, Harris and Walz held a mass rally on Tuesday in Milwaukee at the same time as the convention crowd jammed into the Chicago venue.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, Trump was due to gather supporters in North Carolina for his first outdoor rally since an attempt on his life last month that saw him lightly injured and a bystander killed. Security will be especially tight, with a bulletproof glass screen erected around the podium.</p>

<p>Republicans have ramped up attacks on Walz in an attempt to paint him as an extreme leftist, much as Trump routinely brands Harris a "communist" and "marxist."</p>

<p>But Sabrina Karim, associate professor in the department of government at Cornell University, said Walz was successfully balancing the Harris ticket.</p>

<p>"His form of masculinity stands in contrast to Donald Trump, and provides some voters, particularly white male voters, an alternative way to be masculine that could be appealing."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[California legislators are set to vote on a bill as soon as this week that would broadly regulate how artificial intelligence is developed and deployed in California even as a number of tech giants have voiced broad opposition.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>California legislators are set to vote on a bill as soon as this week that would broadly regulate how artificial intelligence is developed and deployed in California even as a number of tech giants have voiced broad opposition.</p>

<p>Here is background on the bill, known as SB 1047, and why it has faced backlash from Silicon Valley technologists and some lawmakers:</p>

<h3><strong>WHAT DOES THE BILL DO?</strong></h3>

<p>Advanced by State Senator Scott Wiener, a Democrat, the proposal would mandate safety testing for many of the most advanced AI models that cost more than $100 million to develop or those that require a defined amount of computing power. Developers of AI software operating in the state would also need to outline methods for turning off the AI models if they go awry, effectively a kill switch.</p>

<p>The bill would also give the state attorney general the power to sue if developers are not compliant, particularly in the event of an ongoing threat, such as the AI taking over government systems like the power grid.</p>

<p>As well, the bill would require developers to hire third-party auditors to assess their safety practices and provide additional protections to whistleblowers speaking out against AI abuses.</p>

<h3><strong>WHAT HAVE LAWMAKERS SAID?</strong></h3>

<p>SB 1047 has already passed the state Senate by a 32-1 vote. Last week it passed the state Assembly appropriations committee, setting up a vote by the full Assembly. If it passes by the end of the legislative session on Aug. 31, it would advance to Governor Gavin Newsom to sign or veto by Sept. 30.</p>

<p>Wiener, who represents San Francisco, home to OpenAI and many of the startups developing the powerful software, has said legislation is necessary to protect the public before advances in AI become either unwieldy or uncontrollable.</p>

<p>However, a group of California Congressional Democrats oppose the bill, including San Francisco's Nancy Pelosi; Ro Khanna, whose congressional district encompasses much of Silicon Valley; and Zoe Lofgren, from San Jose.</p>

<p>Pelosi this week called SB 1047 ill-informed and said it may cause more harm than good. In an open letter last week, the Democrats said the bill could drive developers from the state and threaten so-called open-source AI models, which rely on code that is freely available for anyone to use or modify.</p>

<h3><strong>WHAT DO TECH LEADERS SAY?</strong></h3>

<p>Tech companies developing AI - which can respond to prompts with fully formed text, images or audio as well as run repetitive tasks with minimal intervention - have called for stronger guardrails for AI's deployment. They have cited risks that the software could one day evade human intervention and cause cyberattacks, among other concerns. But they also largely balked at SB 1047.</p>

<p>Wiener revised the bill to appease tech companies, relying in part on input from AI startup Anthropic - backed by Amazon and Alphabet. Among other changes, he eliminated the creation of a government AI oversight committee.</p>

<p>Wiener also took out criminal penalties for perjury, though civil suits may still be brought.</p>

<p>Alphabet's Google and Meta have expressed concerns in letters to Wiener. Meta said the bill threatens to make the state unfavorable to AI development and deployment. The Facebook parent's chief scientist, Yann LeCun, in a July X post called the bill potentially harmful to research efforts.</p>

<p>OpenAI, whose ChatGPT is credited with accelerating the frenzy over AI since its broad release in late 2022, has said AI should be regulated by the federal government and that SB 1047 creates an uncertain legal environment.</p>

<p>Of particular concern is the potential for the bill to apply to open-source AI models. Many technologists believe open-source models are important for creating less risky AI applications more quickly, but Meta and others have fretted that they could be held responsible for policing open-source models if the bill passes. Wiener has said he supports open-source models and one of the recent amendments to the bill raised the standard for which open-sourced models are covered under its provisions.</p>

<p>The bill also has its backers in the technology sector. Geoffrey Hinton, widely credited as a "godfather of AI," former OpenAI employee Daniel Kokotajlo and researcher Yoshua Bengio have said they support the bill.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Shahed Abu Omar, 20, was in her third year studying computer science at Gaza's Al Azhar University when it was reduced to rubble by Israel's military campaign in the Palestinian territory.</p>

<p>She is now one of 90,000 university students left stranded in a war with no end in sight that has damaged or destroyed all 12 of the higher education institutions in the Gaza Strip, according to Palestinian official data.</p>

<p>However, Abu Omar is determined to keep studying, braving a perilous daily journey to reach a stable internet connection that allows her to learn online.</p>

<p>"We cannot go to our university or study away from it," she said, alluding to the difficulty of remote learning with such poor internet connection.</p>

<p>Perched in the rubble of a destroyed house, Abu Omar studies from her mobile phone. Her mother, Hanin Sarour, said they had come to the area to reach an internet connection. The connection, vital to downloading pre-recorded lectures and communicating with professors, was still weak, she said. "Every step is dangerous and difficult," Sarour added.</p>

<p>Most of Abu Omar's professors are in the Gaza Strip as well, she said, facing the same difficulties their students do.</p>

<p>Abu Omar's final exams are in just two weeks. She fears she will only fall further behind. "I am sure we will lose more than the year that we've lost already," she said.</p>

<p>She dreams of returning to university, sitting in a classroom, and meeting with professors and friends.</p>

<p>The war, now in its 11th month, has also interrupted education for Gaza's estimated 625,000 school-aged children, leaving them unable to attend classes.</p>

<p>The uncertainty for Abu Omar and students across the small coastal enclave is likely to persist. Even after the war ends, students do not know when universities will reopen, she said.</p>

<p>Despite all the difficulties, Abu Omar will continue to study in the hopes of not losing a whole year. "We are trying to achieve something," she said.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump will be behind bulletproof glass Wednesday for his first outdoor rally since surviving an assassination attempt, but the Republican faces a bigger challenge in matching the white-hot enthusiasm of crowds flocking to Kamala Harris.</p>

<p>The event in Asheboro, North Carolina, a battleground state in the tight November 5 election, is a chance for Trump to reclaim his longtime dominance in staging spectacular rallies.</p>

<p>Accompanied by vice presidential pick J.D. Vance, he will take to the stage at an aviation museum, speaking against a backdrop of vintage war planes about his national security policies.</p>

<p>It is the first time he will hold a big event outdoors since being lightly injured in an attempted assassination at a similarly open site in Butler, Pennsylvania, a month ago. That attack left one bystander dead before the shooter was killed in return fire by a Secret Service sniper.</p>

<p>The Secret Service recommended that Trump, 78, stick to more easily controllable indoor venues, such as sports arenas. He has since attended about a dozen indoor events.</p>

<p>The Secret Service does not comment publicly on security operations and did not respond to requests for comment on Wednesday's preparations. However, a screen could clearly be seen being erected around the stage Trump and Vance will speak from later.</p>

<p>Crowds are an integral part of Trump's political brand in which the right-wing billionaire seeks to portray himself as an outsider and man of the people. Even as president he kept up a steady schedule of election-style rallies, often filling sports arenas with at least 10,000 people.</p>

<p>He'd counted on these demonstrations of strength as a key weapon in his plan to make President Joe Biden, whose own public events are generally low-key and relatively small affairs, look ineffectual.</p>

<h3><strong>Trump's rally dominance upended</strong></h3>

<p>Trump's strategy was upended on July 21, however, when Biden, 81, abruptly dropped his reelection bid and endorsed his younger vice president as the future of the Democratic Party.</p>

<p>The immediate explosion of Democratic support for Harris has stunned the Trump campaign.</p>

<p>And nowhere is the shift in momentum more visible than in the 59-year-old Harris's ability to pack arenas.</p>

<p>She is consistently filling venues with well over 10,000. On Tuesday night supporters packed the Democratic National Convention in Chicago while she hosted a mass rally of her own in Milwaukee.</p>

<p>In a clear dig at Trump, her Milwaukee event took place in exactly the same arena that the Republicans had used for their convention back in July.</p>

<p>North Carolina is one of a handful of swing states that are expected to determine the outcome of the November 5 election.</p>

<p>US presidential elections are not decided by an overall national vote but state-by-state, with each state worth varying amounts of Electoral College votes, and the winning candidate needing to score the majority.</p>

<p>Most states trend solidly Republican or firmly Democrat, and only around seven are considered true toss-ups where the race is really fought -- and where the candidates spend most of their campaign.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dosa, butter chicken and mango lassi, an unlikely combo for some perhaps but topping the list of favourites for Polish diners who say the dishes remind them of their travels to the country.</p>

<p>More than 45 Indian restaurants are offering a variety of traditional Indian food across Poland, with the capital Warsaw City having at least a dozen of them, as per the listing of the Embassy of India in Poland here.</p>

<p>And not just dining out, Indian food is popular as a takeaway option too across Poland.</p>

<p>India and Indian food are the talk of the town yet again as Warsaw is excited to receive Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who will arrive here for his two-day visit on Wednesday. This will be the first official visit of an Indian prime minister to this country in 45 years.</p>

<p>In Warsaw, Chetan Nandani, a Gujarati businessman, recently opened a restaurant called 'Chaiwala', possibly alluding to the moniker that has stuck with PM Modi since 2014.</p>

<p>Nandani, who already ran a restaurant called 'Curry House,' opened the 'Chaiwala' owing to the popular demand for Indian food. He claimed to have introduced Indian street food to Warsaw.</p>

<p>Polish people who visit India, who visit metros such as Delhi, Mumbai and Kolkata, they get many other things here but not the Indian street food, Nandani said, adding, "I have named it after our beloved Prime Minister Narendra Modi." "Our 'Curry House' chain is already very big here in Poland. We own nine of them. People were suggesting that because we are from India, we should introduce some Indian street food that Polish people can relish. That was the aim behind opening 'Chaiwala'," he told PTI Videos.</p>

<p>According to Indian restaurant owners, Polish people have developed a liking not just for Indian cuisine but also for its rich culture.</p>

<p>"I really like dosa. The best dosa in Warsaw is in India Gate (restaurant), and it really feels like (those) in South India. I have travelled many times to Chennai and Kerala and actually, the food here definitely tastes like that," Anna Maria Rozek, a Polish national, told PTI Videos here.</p>

<p>Chandu, the owner of India Gate food chain, said, "The food is really tasty here ... Indian food with a lot of spices. Every item has a different taste. They (the Polish people) love butter chicken, mango lassi. They love Indian food and Indian people also." The Polish people also love Indian culture and Indian movies are also doing well in Poland nowadays, Chandu said.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Nandani is also confident the demand for Indian street food will grow more and more in times to come in Poland.</p>

<p>Not just in the capital Warsaw, but Indian restaurants are popular in cities such as Krakow and Wroclaw, offering a variety of options to satisfy the curiosity and cravings of foodies in this eastern European country.</p>

<p>For instance, The Castle, a homestay in Krakow, advertises on its website, "Krakow may be deeply rooted in Polish tradition, but its culinary scene offers a wide range of international flavours, with Indian cuisine taking a prominent spot. If you're craving the spicy and aromatic dishes of India, Krakow has a wide range of restaurants that bring authentic tastes right to your plate." It then lists about half a dozen places in the city.</p>

<p>Krakow Buzz, a site that is all about the buzz about the city, and has guides to everything that's hot in the Polish city of the kings, says: "When those endless plates of Polish dumplings and sour Slavic soups get just a little too much, there's a whole stack of Indian restaurants in Krakow that can come to the rescue." "They'll let you swap the potatoes and carbs of Central Europe for a tongue-sizzling sampling of the East. They tout spice-packed curries and pakoras, and can be found in some seriously stunning corners of the city," it describes the mouth-watering Indian dishes and goes on to detail at least half a dozen Indian restaurants in the city.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Veronica Roleen Gast, 30, was arrested in Minnesota for attempting to run over her boyfriend during a heated argument en route to couples therapy.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Minnesota woman was arrested after allegedly trying to crush her boyfriend under her car during an intense fight. According to police reports, Veronica Roleen Gast, 30, and her boyfriend were driving to a couple therapy session when the argument quickly became out of hand. The boyfriend, whose name has not been disclosed, told the authorities that he chose to end the relationship and asked Gast to take him home.</p>

<p>Gast reportedly became furious and parked the car on the road, forcing her boyfriend to get out. As he walked away from the vehicle, Gast was said to have driven the car towards him, nearly hitting him. Witnesses to the incident called it a harrowing experience.</p>

<p>The boyfriend rolled over the hood, and smashed into the windshield, shattering it. He suffered a laceration to his right elbow.</p>

<p>Gast was taken into custody and charged with second-degree assault and criminal vehicular operation. She is facing charges of "bodily harm, gross negligence, and domestic assault.". The investigation into the incident is ongoing.</p>

<p>"The defendant admitted that as she was pulling away, she hit the victim with her vehicle. The defendant said she slowed down and stopped to call the police," a police report obtained by <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.crimeonline.com/2024/08/15/minnesota-woman-floors-gas-pedal-rams-boyfriend-into-windshield-on-way-to-couples-therapy/"><em>Crime Online</em></a> said.</p>

<p>"The defendant said she was in shock at hitting the victim, so she did not stop right away but let off the gas," the report continued.</p>

<p>Gast told officers the windshield crack wasn't caused by his body but by him punching it. It's unclear whether Gast sustained any injuries.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The bodies of British tech entrepreneur Mike Lynch and his daughter Hannah have been found in the yacht which sank off Sicily, the Daily Telegraph newspaper reported on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Scuba divers scouring the wreck of British tech magnate's family yacht, which sank two days ago, had earlier found two bodies inside it, a source close to rescue operations had said on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Inspection of the wreck, lying sideways at a depth of around 50 metres, was a "long and complex" operation, the Italian fire department said, with inside spaces obstructed by furniture and debris, and scuba divers having just 8-10 minutes beneath the water before needing to resurface.</p>

<p>Separately, the coast guard deployed a remotely operated vehicle to scan the seabed and take underwater pictures and videos that it said may provide "useful and timely elements" for prosecutors looking into the disaster.</p>

<p>The coast guard has been questioning survivors, including the captain of the Bayesian, and passengers on the yacht that was moored next to it who witnessed the ship going down, judicial sources said.</p>

<p>No one is under investigation at the moment, sources added.</p>

<p>The British-flagged Bayesian, a 56-metre-long (184-ft) superyacht, was carrying 22 people, and was anchored off the port of Porticello, near Palermo, when it capsized during a fierce storm on Monday.</p>

<p>The Bayesian, which was owned by Lynch's wife, was built by Italian shipbuilder Perini in 2008 and last refitted in 2020. It had the world's tallest aluminium mast, measuring 72 metres, according to its makers.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Pakistani man appeared in court Wednesday to face charges of cyber terrorism after allegedly spreading disinformation on his clickbait website thought to have fuelled anti-immigration riots in Britain.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Farhan Asif was accused of publishing an article on his Channel3Now website falsely claiming that a Muslim asylum seeker was suspected in a deadly knife attack on children in the United Kingdom.&nbsp;</p>

<p>UK authorities have blamed online misinformation for sparking days of riots which targeted mosques and hotels housing asylum seekers as well as police officers and other properties.</p>

<p>"He is a 31-year-old software engineer with no journalism credentials, apart from running the Channel3Now website, which served as a source of income for him," a senior official at Pakistan's Federal Investigation Agency told AFP on condition of anonymity.</p>

<p>"Initial investigations indicate that his sole intent was to make money through clickbait content."</p>

<p>Asif appeared at a Lahore district court on Wednesday charged with cyber terrorism and was remanded to custody for one day, the official added.</p>

<p>The article with the false information was published on Channel3Now just hours after the attack and was widely cited in viral social media posts.</p>

<p>More than a dozen English towns and cities saw unrest and riots after the July 29 knife attack that killed three girls during a dance class in Southport.</p>

<p>The man charged with murder and attempted murder over the stabbing spree, Axel Rudakubana, was born in Britain to parents who hail from Rwanda, an overwhelmingly Christian country.</p>

<p>Officials have blamed far-right elements for helping to stir up the disorder.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Scuba divers scouring the wreck of British tech magnate Mike Lynch's family yacht, which sank off Sicily two days ago, have found two bodies inside it, a source close to rescue operations said on Wednesday.</p>

<p>One of the bodies belonged to a heavily built man, the source said.</p>

<p>Rescue officials have been looking for six missing people, including Lynch, his 18-year-old daughter and Jonathan Bloomer, a non-executive chair of Morgan Stanley International.</p>

<p>The British-flagged Bayesian, a 56-metre-long (184-ft) superyacht, was carrying 22 people, and was anchored off the port of Porticello, near Palermo, when it capsized during a fierce storm on Monday.</p>

<p>Fifteen people survived, while the body of the onboard chef, Canadian-Antiguan national Recaldo Thomas, was found near the wreck hours after the disaster.</p>

<p>Inspection of the wreck, lying sideways at a depth of around 50 metres, was a "long and complex" operation, the Italian fire department said, with inside spaces obstructed by furniture and debris, and scuba divers having just 8-10 minutes beneath the water before needing to resurface.</p>

<p>Separately, the coast guard deployed a remotely operated vehicle to scan the seabed and take underwater pictures and videos that it said may provide "useful and timely elements" for prosecutors looking into the disaster.</p>

<p>The coast guard has been questioning survivors, including the captain of the Bayesian, and passengers on the yacht that was moored next to it who witnessed the ship going down, judicial sources said.</p>

<p>No one is under investigation at the moment, sources added.</p>

<h3><strong>MISSING PASSENGERS</strong></h3>

<p>Lynch, 59, is one of the UK's best-known tech entrepreneurs and has been referred to as the country's Bill Gates.</p>

<p>He built the UK's largest software firm, Autonomy, which was sold to HP for $11 billion in 2011, after which the deal spectacularly unravelled with the U.S. tech giant accusing him of fraud, resulting in a lengthy trial. Lynch was acquitted on all charges by a jury in San Francisco in June.</p>

<p>The other missing passengers were Bloomer's wife Judy, Clifford Chance lawyer Chris Morvillo and his wife, Neda Morvillo. Morvillo represented Lynch in the San Francisco trial, while Bloomer was a character witness on his behalf.</p>

<p>Experts have been at a loss to explain how a large luxury vessel, presumed to have top-class fittings and safety features, could have sunk within minutes, as recounted by witnesses. The yacht anchored next to it was unharmed by the tempest.</p>

<p>The Bayesian, which was owned by Lynch's wife, was built by Italian shipbuilder Perini in 2008 and last refitted in 2020. It had the world's tallest aluminium mast, measuring 72 metres, according to its makers.</p>

<h3><strong>BLACK SWAN EVENT</strong></h3>

<p>Its captain James Cutfield, a 51-year-old New Zealander who survived the shipwreck, was a "very good sailor" and "very well respected" in the Mediterranean, his brother Mark told The New Zealand Herald.</p>

<p>Matthew Schanck, chair of the Maritime Search and Rescue Council, a UK-based non-profit organisation that trains sea rescuers, said the Bayesian was the victim of a "high impact" weather-related incident.</p>

<p>"If it was a water spout, which it appears to be, it's what I would class as like a 'black swan' event," he told Reuters, referring to a rare and unpredictable phenomenon.</p>

<p>He said he was confident the authorities would "get to the bottom" of what caused the shipwreck, thanks to the accounts of survivors, witnesses and examination of the sunken hull, which did not show any apparent signs of damage.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As Poland rolled out the red carpet for Prime Minister Narendra Modi today, hundreds of 'Indian Poles' are commemorating a historic facet of India-Poland relations which has been the bedrock of people-to-people ties between the two countries since the Second World War.</p>

<p>"One of the unique bonds between our countries relates to the time in the 1940s, during World War II, when more than 6,000 Polish women and children found refuge in two princely states in India, Jamnagar and Kolhapur. As you may be aware, Jam Sahib of Nawanagar had provided shelter to more than 1,000 Polish children, and others were offered refuge in Kolhapur," Tanmaya Lal, Secretary (West) at the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said earlier this week while announcing PM Modi's August 21-22 visit, the first by an Indian Prime Minister to Poland in the past 45 years.</p>

<p>While Digvijaysinhji Ranjitsinhji Jadeja, the Jam Sahib of Nawanagar who is known in Poland as the 'Good Maharaja', gave refuge to over 1,000 Polish children in the famous Balachadi camp, the royal family of Kolhapur provided safe haven to more than 5,000 Polish women and children in the equally-famous Valivade camp.</p>

<p>A monument, commemorating Jam Sahib Digvijaysinhji Ranjitsinhji Jadeja, was unveiled in October, 2014 at the Square of the Good Maharaja, Ochota District in Warsaw.</p>

<p>Another plaque commemorating the Valivade-Kolhapur camp near the Monte Casino War Memorial was inaugurated in November 2017 in Warsaw.</p>

<p>As many as eight Polish primary and secondary schools are also named after Jam Sahib.</p>

<p>During his historic visit, PM Modi is scheduled to visit these memorials that commemorate the very special episodes of Jamnagar and Kolhapur.</p>

<p>A large number of Polish refugees and their descendants have, over the last many decades, expressed their gratitude towards the two royal families of India by building memorials in Warsaw and organising annual events to keep the memories alive.</p>

<p>The Association of Poles in India, which reunites all the Polish people who lived between 1942 and 1948 in the two camps set up by the Maharajas of Jamnagar and Kolhapur, meets once in two years to recall and reiterate their gratitude and affection for the two royal families and the people of India.</p>

<p>During its last meeting held in Gdansk in September 2023, the first after the Covid pandemic, Jan Chendynski, the President of the Association, recounted "some of the happy childhood memories" that most of them had of the camps.</p>

<p>Nagma Mallick, India's Ambassador to Poland, who attended the meeting as a special invitee, acknowledged that the story of the Polish refugees was not as well-known in India as it deserved to be and also commended the Indian Poles for keeping this memory alive in Poland.</p>

<p>Commemorating the historic link, another event titled 'Remembering the Good Maharajas' was organised in the Old Orangery of the iconic Royal Lazienki park in July 2022 where 22 photographs from the camps of Valivade and Nawanagar depicting the lives of the Polish children in India during that period were exhibited for the guests.</p>

<p>Sambhaji Chhatrapati, the descendant of the Chhatrapati Shivaji and Piyushkumar Matalia, representative of the Jam Sahib of Nawanagar, especially flew from India to attend the event while former MP and President of the Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR) Vinay Sahasrabuddhe and Ambassador Mallick, represented the Indian government at the event which was attended by a large number of Polish citizens who were in the camps as children.</p>

<p>According to the Indian Embassy in Poland, there is also a strong tradition of Indology studies in Poland, with Polish scholars having translated Sanskrit into Polish as early as in the 19th Century.</p>

<p>"Sanskrit was being studied at the 600-year-old Jagiellonian University in Krakow (the oldest in Poland) in 1860-61, with a Chair of Sanskrit having been established there in 1893.</p>

<p>The Indology Department of the Oriental Institute at the University of Warsaw (established in 1932) is the biggest centre for Indian studies in Central Europe," the MEA states.</p>

<p>Study of Indian languages, literature, culture and Indology is also pursued at the Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznan and the University of Wroclaw.</p>

<p>ICCR sponsored the first Central &amp; Eastern European regional conference of Indology in Warsaw University in September 2005 in which 19 scholars from 11 countries participated.</p>

<p>An MoU for the establishment of an ICCR Chair of Indian studies at the Jagiellonian University was signed in February 2017 and two Indian professors have since been appointed as ICCR Chair Professors since the signing of the MoU.</p>

<p>"There are long-standing cultural ties between India and Poland, and Indology studies in Polish universities date back to the 19th century. There is respect and appreciation in Poland for Indian culture and spiritual ethos, including yoga and Ayurveda," said MEA's Secretary (West) Tanmaya Lal on Monday, ahead of the PM's visit to Poland.</p>

<p>In Warsaw, PM Modi will hold talks with the country's President Andrzej Duda on Thursday.</p>

<p>He is also scheduled to interact with members of the Indian community, select Polish business leaders and prominent Indologists.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[WhatsApp users are being warned about a new scam targeting the group messaging feature, with cybercriminals infiltrating chats and tricking victims into sharing personal information.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Online scam experts have issued a warning for WhatsApp users to be on guard after a spate of reports of a new scam tricking people using the group messaging feature. With more than two billion monthly active users, WhatsApp is now a happy hunting ground for cybercriminals looking for personal information.</p>

<p>The British national cybercrime centre, Action Fraud, has warned that there have been more than 630 cases reported this year where fraudsters infiltrate group chats by pretending to be legitimate members and incite users into giving out sensitive information.</p>

<p>Experts are warning WhatsApp users to be vigilant over messages sent in group chats that are unsolicited or suspicious. If a user is getting this kind of message, it could mean that someone is running a scam. Hence, it is important to be alert every second and take matters to the concerned authority so that leakage of data can be averted.</p>

<p><strong>How Fraudsters Scam The Users</strong></p>

<p>According to a<em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.actionfraud.police.uk/news/whatsapp-group-chats"> release by Action Fraud</a></em>, the scam often begins when a member of the group receives a WhatsApp audio call from the fraudster, pretending or claiming to be another member of the group. Then the fraudster will tell the victim they are sending them a one-time passcode, which will allow them to join an upcoming video call for group members. In reality, the criminal is asking for a registration code to register the victim's WhatsApp account on a new device so they can take over their account.</p>

<p>Once the fraudster has access to the victim's WhatsApp account, they will enable two-step verification, which makes it impossible for the victim to regain access to their account. Other members of the group, or friends and family in the victim's contacts, will then be messaged, asking them to transfer money urgently as they are in desperate need of help.</p>

<p>"With more than 630 reports already this year, we are urging users, and in particular those in big group chats on WhatsApp, to be on their guard and monitor who joins the chats," Detective Superintendent Gary Miles, Head of the National Fraud Intelligence Bureau at the City of London Police, said.</p>

<p>Reacting to the reports of the scam a WhatsApp spokesperson said: "All personal messages sent on WhatsApp are protected by end-to-end encryption, but we can all play a role in keeping our accounts safe."</p>

<p>"We recommend that all users set up two-step verification for added security and advise people never to share their six-digit PIN code with others, not even with friends or family."</p>

<p>"If you receive a suspicious message (even if you think you know who it's from), calling or requesting a voice note is the fastest and simplest way to check that someone is who they say they are."</p>

<p>As of July 2023, WhatsApp had around 2.78 billion active users worldwide. The messaging app reached 2 billion users in 2020 and is expected to reach 3.14 billion by 2025.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A storm erupted at the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://sports.ndtv.com/olympics-2024/vinesh-phogat-disqualification-to-imane-khelif-gender-row-five-biggest-controversies-of-paris-olympics-2024-6320003" target="_blank">Paris Olympics 2024</a> over the participation of Khelif after her Italian opponent, Angela Carini. pulled out of their bout less than a minute into the fight after taking a barrage of punches. Carini was seen sobbing and also refused to shake hands with Khelif.</p>

<p>Khelif, who was disqualified from last year's world championships after failing gender eligibility testing, was then trolled online.</p>

<p>The legal complaint against Musk and Rowling has been filed&nbsp;for online harassment, the American magazine Variety reported on Tuesday.</p>

<p>"JK Rowling and Elon Musk are named in the lawsuit, among others," Nabil Boudi, the Paris-based attorney of Khelif, told Variety.</p>

<p>He also said that former US president Donald Trump would be part of the investigation.</p>

<p>"Trump tweeted, so whether or not he is named in our lawsuit, he will inevitably be looked into as part of the prosecution," Boudi said.</p>

<h3><strong>What Elon Musk, JK Rowling, Donald Trump Said</strong></h3>

<p>Elon Musk had retweeted an X post by American swimmer Riley Gaines who wrote, "Men don't belong in women's sports #IStandWithAngelaCarini."</p>

<p>"Absolutely," he wrote in a retweet of Gaines' initial message.</p>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Harry Potter creator JK Rowling had referred to the Algerian boxer as a man.</p>

<p>"Watch this (whole thread), then explain why you're OK with a man beating a woman in public for your entertainment. This isn't sport. From the bullying cheat in red all the way up to the organisers who allowed this to happen, this is men revelling in their power over women," she posted on X after the Carini-Khelif fight.</p>

<p>In another post, Rowling shared a photograph of Carini crying and Khelif looking at her.</p>

<p>"The boxer Imane Khelif has decided to begin a new fight, a fight for justice, dignity and honour," Boudi said in a statement, saying Khelif had filed the complaint for "aggravated online harassment... to Paris prosecutors".</p>

<p>"The investigation will determine who was behind this misogynist, racist and sexist campaign, but will also have to concern itself with those who fed the online lynching,"&nbsp;he added.&nbsp;</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pineapple sweets dished out by a New Zealand charity have tested positive for potentially lethal amounts of methamphetamine, police said Wednesday, sparking an urgent race to remove them from the streets.</p>

<p>Anti-poverty charity the Auckland City Mission raised the alarm after discovering a batch of the sweets was contaminated with the highly addictive and illegal narcotic, police said.</p>

<p>"An investigation is underway and police are treating the matter as a priority given the risk to the public."</p>

<p>The New Zealand Drug Foundation said a test sample of an innocuous-looking piece of white candy in a bright yellow wrapper indicated it contained methamphetamine.</p>

<p>Foundation spokeswoman Sarah Helm said the tested sweet contained approximately three grams of meth -- hundreds of times greater than the common dose taken by users.</p>

<p>"Swallowing that much methamphetamine is extremely dangerous and could result in death."</p>

<p>Helm urged people who had received confectionaries from the Auckland charity not to consume them.</p>

<p>"We don't know how widespread it is."</p>

<p>The candy was donated anonymously by a member of the public, the charity said, in a sealed branded package. The sweets were then distributed into food parcels.</p>

<p>"There is a potential for New Zealand that there is a lethal substance dressed up as a lolly (sweet)," Helen Robinson from Auckland City Mission told reporters.</p>

<p>"We have to work on the assumption that this was a kind of batch."</p>

<p>The charity believes up to 400 people could have received the affected sweets in a food package.</p>

<p>Robinson said so far eight separate families had been affected, but no one had yet been hospitalised.</p>

<p>She knew of an instance where a parent gave one of the candies to her child, who immediately spat it out.</p>

<p>Robinson said she had been told the potent contaminated sweets tasted "acrid and revolting".</p>

<p>"You could have only a very small touch or lick of the substance and still be deeply affected," she warned.</p>

<p>A contaminated sweet was taken for testing when a person felt strange after starting to eat it and noticed a bitter taste.</p>

<p>Methamphetamine can cause chest pain, racing heart, seizures, delirium and loss of consciousness, the drug foundation warned.</p>

<p>Helm told Radio New Zealand it is common for drug smugglers to hide illegal narcotics in food form.</p>

<p>"We suspect somebody hasn't intentionally sought to poison children. It will be up to police to determine," she added in the interview.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nate Bryne, a weather presenter from Australia, recently suffered a panic attack on air and was forced to halt his morning broadcast. The ABC News Breakfast reporter abruptly stopped speaking in the middle of reading Queensland's weather report around 6:30 am local time on Tuesday. The incident was captured on camera.</p>

<p>"I'm going to need to stop for a second," the meteorologist told viewers as he struggled to speak. "Some of you may know that I occasionally get affected by some panic attacks, and actually that's happening right now," he added.</p>

<p>Further, Lisa Millar, Mr Bryne's co-host, took over the show right away. Later, he returned and apologised to anyone who had been alarmed by his abrupt departure. "Thank you all so much for helping me out. Sorry if I gave anybody a bit of a scare," he said.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-media-max-width="560">

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>In 2022, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-02-24/nate-byrne-news-breakfast-panic-attack-anxiety/100848904">Mr Bryne talked about his first panic attack</a>, describing it as "terrifying" and how it altered his perspective on mental health. "As I stood there under the studio lights, talking to people having their morning coffee and wiping sleep from their eyes, my heart was racing, I was gasping for breath and sweat was pouring out of every pore as my brain screamed 'RUN!'" the weather presenter wrote.</p>

<p>He recalled the situation and added that he "had just jogged the 40 metres" from his desk to his position at ABC News Breakfast's weather wall. "I had left it a little too late and the show's control room was worried I wouldn't make it in time. I did, and it was barely an exertion. But it was enough to trigger an anxiety problem I still deal with to this day," he said.</p>

<p>Notably, a panic attack is characterised by intense physical reactions to common, non-threatening events as well as quick, transient sensations of anxiety. You can feel like your heart is pounding, sweat a lot, and have trouble breathing when you're having a panic attack. You can have what seems like a heart attack, according to the Cleveland Clinic.</p>

<p>These attacks are unpleasant and can be frightening. They usually last five to 20 minutes. Symptoms often peak within 10 minutes of onset and then fade quickly.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Nearly half a billion children are facing twice as many days of extreme heat each year -- or more -- than their grandparents did, the UN said Tuesday, warning of deadly consequences.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nearly half a billion children are facing twice as many days of extreme heat each year -- or more -- than their grandparents did, the UN said Tuesday, warning of deadly consequences.</p>

<p>As climate change continues to push up temperatures globally, one in five children -- some 466 million kids -- live in areas that are registering "at least double the number of extremely hot days every year" compared to 60 years ago, the UN children's agency UNICEF said.</p>

<p>"The bodies of young children are not like little adults, they have much more vulnerability to extreme heat," UNICEF advocacy chief Lily Caprani told AFP, also warning of dangers for pregnant women.</p>

<p>Additionally, children lose out on education when schools are forced to close due to high temperatures -- which has affected at least 80 million children in 2024 so far.</p>

<p>UNICEF used days reaching 95 degrees Fahrenheit (35 degrees Celsius) as its benchmark, comparing average temperatures in the 2020-2024 period to the 1960s.</p>

<p>Such hot days -- as well as the means to cope with high temperatures, such as air conditioning -- affect the entire world, it noted.</p>

<p>Children in West and Central Africa are the most exposed, with 123 million children -- 39 per cent of the kids in the region -- facing a third of each year with 95-degree days or higher.</p>

<p>At the higher end, in Mali, for example, air conditioning is out of reach for millions, and blackouts can leave fans idled. More than 200 days a year can reach 95 degrees or higher.</p>

<p>In Latin America, meanwhile, 48 million children are facing double the number of 95-degree or higher days than 60 years ago.</p>

<p>Worldwide, the "trajectory is getting worse and worse for these children," Caprani said.</p>

<p>Children "are fragile and they breathe very quickly. They can't even sweat like an adult does. They are much more vulnerable to heat stress and it can be literally deadly," she added.</p>

<p>High temperatures can contribute to child malnutrition and leave kids more vulnerable to disease, especially malaria and dengue, which spread in warm climates, UNICEF warned.</p>

<p>Excessive heat can also negatively impact neurodevelopment and mental health.</p>

<p>UNICEF is calling for increased education for parents to know the signs of heat stroke, better training for medical personnel, and investing in air conditioning in schools -- where, even when classes aren't cancelled, learning can be made difficult by hot conditions.</p>

<p>Yet the bigger push remains in reining in climate change, caused by humanity's use of fossil fuels.</p>

<p>"As governments are currently drafting their national climate action plans, they can do so with the ambition and knowledge that today's children and future generations will have to live in the world they leave behind," UNICEF chief Catherine Russell said in a statement.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Queen Elizabeth II would drink a martini before meeting guests mid-air and sleep on her pillows from home on the plane, a flight attendant who once served the longest-reigning monarch has revealed in her notes.</p>

<p>The Queen "tends to like a martini before her guests arrive," Elizabeth Evans, who worked with the British Airways for 28 years, said in her notes, which are set to be auctioned on Thursday.</p>

<p>In 1989, during a British Airways Royal Flight, Evans' VIP guests were Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip during a tour of Singapore and Malaysia.</p>

<p>Evans, who died at age 70 in 2017, was also awarded a certificate to commemorate the occasion.</p>

<p>In her notes, she also revealed that Queen Elizabeth II, the monarch who reigned from February 1952 until her death in September 2022, would request a bowl of Velamints to have on hand before takeoff and in her dressing room.</p>

<p>The queen's dresser made up her bed and no one was to wake her if she was asleep when the plane arrived, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://hansonsauctioneers.co.uk/queens-mints-for-take-off-air-hostesss-concorde-and-ba-memorabilia-reveals-royal-etiquette-and-star-studded-passenger-lists/" target="_blank">Hansons Auctioneers</a>, which is auctioning off late flight attendant's collection, said citing Evans.</p>

<p>"If Her Majesty was asleep prior to landing cabin crew were instructed not to disturb her. She should be left in her bed," the auction house said.</p>

<p>Evans had also served several celebrities during her time with British Airways aboard the Concorde, the world's first commercial supersonic airliner.</p>

<p>Her memorabilia is set to go to auction with an estimated value of roughly $500 to $760.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Syrsky tells him: "As of today, our troops have advanced in some areas by 1 to 3 kilometres."</p>

<p>In the last day, Ukraine has taken "over 40 square kilometres of territory", Syrsky adds, after saying Monday that the troops hold around 1,000 square kilometres of Russian territory.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>UK police have arrested over 1,000 people in connection with riots which took place over the last two weeks in England, officials said on Tuesday.</p>

<p>"Forces across the country have now made more than 1,000 arrests in connection with the recent violent disorder," the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) said on X.</p>

<p>At least 575 people have been charged, as courts continued to deal with those involved in the disorder, which took place across dozens of towns and cities in England and Northern Ireland following the death of three girls in a stabbing on July 29.</p>

<p>Far-right riots took place after misinformation spread about the identity of the alleged perpetrator of the knife attack, with multiple people being jailed for spreading hate online in recent days.</p>

<p>The United Kingdom's judiciary is swiftly moving through court cases and handing down lengthy sentences after disorder calmed down ahead of the weekend and the government vowed to crackdown on those involved.</p>

<p>Among those appearing in court Tuesday was a 13-year-old girl who admitted to threatening unlawful violence outside an asylum seeker accommodation in Aldershot in the south.</p>

<p>One man, John Honey, pleaded guilty after being accused of helping attack a car with three Romanian men in it and attacking police during riots in Hull, northeast England.</p>

<p>Honey also admitted to three charges of burglary after he took part in looting several stores.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir, who has often ignored the Israeli government's longstanding ban, vowed to "defeat Hamas" in Gaza in a video he filmed during his visit.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A far-right Israeli minister drew international condemnation Tuesday by praying with thousands of Jews at the Al-Aqsa mosque compound in annexed east Jerusalem, defying a ban on Jewish prayer at the flashpoint site.</p>

<p>National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir, who has often ignored the Israeli government's longstanding ban, vowed to "defeat Hamas" in Gaza in a video he filmed during his visit.</p>

<p>The compound is Islam's third holiest site and a symbol of Palestinian national identity, but it is also Judaism's holiest place, revered as the site of the ancient temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 AD.</p>

<p>While Jews and other non-Muslims are allowed to visit the mosque compound in Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem during specified hours, they are not permitted to pray or display religious symbols.</p>

<p>The visit comes at a tense time during the 10-month Israel-Hamas war, with faltering efforts for a ceasefire and Israel braced for threatened attacks from Iran and its proxies.</p>

<p>Ben Gvir's latest visit drew sharp condemnation from both Muslim countries as well as Western powers, including the United States, the European Union and the United Nations.</p>

<p>US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Ben Gvir showed "blatant disregard" for the status quo at the site and urged Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to prevent such actions.</p>

<p>"These provocative actions only exacerbate tensions at a pivotal moment when all focus should be on the ongoing diplomatic efforts to achieve a (Gaza) ceasefire agreement and secure the release of all hostages and create the conditions for broader regional stability," he said.</p>

<p>Days earlier the White House used strong language to call out another far-right member of Netanyahu's cabinet, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, who criticized President Joe Biden's push for a Gaza ceasefire.</p>

<p>In recent years, the restrictions at the compound have been increasingly flouted by hardline religious nationalists like Ben Gvir, prompting sometimes violent reactions from Palestinians.</p>

<p>On Tuesday morning, he and some 2,250 other Israelis walked through the compound in groups, singing Jewish hymns, under the protection of Israeli police, an official from the Waqf, the Jordanian body that is custodian of the site, told AFP.</p>

<p>Israeli police also "imposed restrictions" on Muslim worshippers trying to enter the mosque, he said, adding that more than 700 Jews also prayed there in the afternoon.</p>

<p>"Minister Ben Gvir, instead of maintaining the status quo at the mosque, is supervising the Judaisation operation and trying to change the situation inside Al-Aqsa Mosque," the official said on condition of anonymity, as he was not authorised to speak on the matter.</p>

<p>- 'Unduly provocative' -<br />
Jordan's foreign ministry condemned the "storming" of the mosque, calling it a "flagrant violation of international law".</p>

<p>"The continual violations of the historical and legal status quo in Jerusalem and its sanctities require a clear and firm international position that condemns these violations," ministry spokesperson Sufyan al-Qudah said in a statement.</p>

<p>The Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, an umbrella group of Muslim-majority states, "strongly condemned" the incident and said it was a "provocation to the feelings of Muslims all over the world".</p>

<p>Farhan Haq, deputy spokesperson of United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, said the UN was "against any efforts to change the status quo within the holy sites".&nbsp;</p>

<p>"This sort of behaviour is unhelpful and it is unduly provocative," he added.</p>

<p>European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell posted on X that the bloc "strongly condemns the provocations" by Ben Gvir.</p>

<p>France's foreign ministry said in a statement: "This new provocation is unacceptable."</p>

<p>Images posted on social media networks showed Ben Gvir inside the compound while several Israelis lay on the ground performing Talmudic rituals.</p>

<p>Ben Gvir released a video statement on X, which he filmed inside the compound himself, renewing his opposition to any truce in the war in Gaza.</p>

<p>"We must win this war. We must win and not go to the talks in Doha or Cairo," he said, referring to the US-backed negotiations for a truce and hostage release deal for Gaza set to resume on Thursday.</p>

<p>"We can defeat Hamas... we must bring them down to their knees," Ben Gvir said.</p>

<p>Tuesday's entry into the Al-Aqsa compound comes on the Jewish mourning day of Tisha Be'Av that commemorates the destruction of the ancient temple.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris's campaign said Tuesday it had been targeted by foreign hackers, days after rival Donald Trump's campaign suggested that it had been hacked by Iran.</p>

<p>"In July, the campaign legal and security teams were notified by the FBI that we were targeted by a foreign actor influence operation," a Harris campaign official told AFP.</p>

<p>"We have robust cybersecurity measures in place, and are not aware of any security breaches of our systems resulting from those efforts."&nbsp;</p>

<p>The campaign did not give any indication of which foreign power was believed to be behind the attempt but said it remained in contact with law enforcement agencies.</p>

<p>The US State Department warned Iran on Monday of consequences over election interference following the Trump campaign's announcement that it had been hacked.</p>

<p>The Trump campaign suggested on Saturday that Iran was behind the breach in which documents including research they used to vet running mate J.D. Vance were sent to reporters.</p>

<p>It warned media outlets against reprinting the documents, saying that such action would be "doing the bidding of America's enemies."</p>

<p>The tone was different to 2016, when Trump said at a news conference that he hoped Russia would "find" Hillary Clinton's emails, remarks widely viewed as encouraging further hacks of his election opponent.</p>

<p>US intelligence concluded that Russia intervened in the 2016 election to support Trump, who has rejected the findings.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden's administration on Tuesday approved more than $20 billion in new weapons sales to Israel, brushing aside pressure from rights activists to stop arms deliveries over the humanitarian toll in Gaza.</p>

<p>The sale comes as Biden presses Israel and Hamas to reach a ceasefire after 10 months of bloodshed, although the weapons would take years to reach Israel.</p>

<p>In a notification to Congress, the State Department said it had approved a sale of 50 F-15 fighter-jets to Israel for $18.82 billion.</p>

<p>Israel will also buy nearly 33,000 tank cartridges, up to 50,000 explosive mortar cartridges and new military cargo vehicles.</p>

<p>The F-15 aircraft, which will begin to be delivered in 2029, will upgrade Israel's current fleet and include radars and secure communications equipment.</p>

<p>"The United States is committed to the security of Israel, and it is vital to US national interests to assist Israel to develop and maintain a strong and ready self-defense capability," the State Department said in its notice on the F-15s, which are made by Boeing.</p>

<p>On the tank cartridges, the United States said the sale "will improve Israel's capability to meet current and future enemy threats, strengthen its homeland defense and serve as a deterrent to regional threats."</p>

<p>Congress can still block weapons sales, but such a process is difficult.</p>

<p>Human rights groups and some left-leaning members of Biden's Democratic Party have urged the administration to curb or stop weapons sales to Israel as they voice revulsion at civilian casualties in the Gaza conflict.</p>

<p>On Saturday, rescuers in the Hamas-run territory said that 93 people were killed in an Israeli air strike at a school housing displaced Palestinians.</p>

<p>Israel said it was targeting militants operating out of the school. Biden administration officials voiced concern over civilian deaths and declined comment on whether US weapons were used.</p>

<p>In May, Biden froze a shipment to Israel that included 2,000-pound bombs as he warned against a mass-scale assault on the southern Gaza city of Rafah, where vast numbers of displaced Palestinians were living.</p>

<p>But the administration said it has not stopped other weapons and dismissed complaints in June by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that the United States was slowing down deliveries.</p>

<p>The Gaza war began with Hamas's October 7 attack on southern Israel which resulted in the deaths of 1,198 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures.</p>

<p>Militants also seized 251 people, 111 of whom are still held captive in Gaza, including 39 the military says are dead.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory military offensive in Gaza has killed at least 39,929 people, according to a toll from the territory's health ministry, which does not provide a breakdown of civilian and militant deaths.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Police registered a blasphemy case against a private school owner and her maid in Rai Kalan village in the Kasur district of Punjab after accusations emerged that they had desecrated pages of the Quran, Dawn News reported on Tuesday.</p>

<p>The incident, which occurred on Friday, was captured in a video that quickly went viral on social media the following day.</p>

<p>As a result, large crowds from neighbouring villages gathered outside the school and police arrived in a substantial number.</p>

<p>According to the FIR, the school's driver and gardener recorded the video of the burned pages and reported it to the complainant. The allegations suggest that the maid burned the pages under the direction of the school owner. The police have stated that the situation is under control and that arrests will be made soon.</p>

<p>Blasphemy is a highly sensitive and contentious issue in Pakistan, where allegations of insulting religion or religious texts can result in severe legal repercussions and societal backlash.</p>

<p>In Pakistan, false allegations of blasphemy have led to severe consequences for many individuals, often driven by personal grievances or social tensions.</p>

<p>One prominent case is that of Asia Bibi, a Christian woman who was falsely accused of blasphemy in 2009. Despite her eventual acquittal by the Supreme Court in 2018, her case drew significant international attention and highlighted the dangers of false accusations, as Dawn News reported.</p>

<p>Similarly, Mashal Khan, a university student, was brutally lynched in 2017 after being wrongfully accused of blasphemy, a situation exacerbated by personal vendettas.</p>

<p>The case of Sawan Masih, a Christian man accused in 2013, resulted in violent attacks on Christian communities and was criticized for its lack of credible evidence.</p>

<p>Additionally, Rimsha Masih, a young Christian girl with learning disabilities, faced accusations in 2012 that were later shown to be fabricated, underscoring the vulnerability of those targeted by false claims. These cases illustrate the severe impact and risks associated with false blasphemy allegations in Pakistan, reported Dawn News.</p>

<p>The blasphemy laws in Pakistan have been criticized for being frequently misused to settle personal scores, target minority communities, or incite violence. False accusations can lead to severe social and legal repercussions, including mob violence and extrajudicial killing.</p>

<p>The enforcement of blasphemy laws has faced criticism for lack of due process, with many cases resulting in lengthy legal battles and significant social unrest.</p>

<p>Moreover, the judicial process is often influenced by public opinion and pressure from extremist groups. Human rights organizations and international bodies have condemned the blasphemy laws for their potential to infringe on fundamental rights and freedoms.</p>

<p>Critics argue that the laws violate principles of free speech and are used to persecute religious minorities and dissenters.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>SpaceX is aiming to break new barriers in polar exploration with the first manned space mission over the Earth's poles -- a private flight commanded by a crypto entrepreneur later this year, the company said Tuesday.</p>

<p>The mission, dubbed "Fram2" after a 19th century polar expedition schooner, is due to last between three to five days, and was purchased by Chun Wang, a wealthy bitcoin pioneer who founded f2pool and stakefish, for an undisclosed amount.</p>

<p>He will be joined by three polar experts: Norwegian filmmaker Jannicke Mikkelsen, German robotics researcher Rabea Rogge, and Australian polar adventurer Eric Philips.</p>

<p>It is the latest foray by the aerospace industry into private space tourism, growing fast in the United States in recent years.</p>

<p>"From mission proposal, planning, trajectory design, to crew selection, everything has been done by the customer," Mr Wang, reportedly born and raised in China but now a Maltese citizen, said in a post on X.</p>

<p>"A new chapter in space exploration is unfolding before our eyes," he said.</p>

<p>Satellites have flown over the poles, but due to the Earth's rotation, reaching them can take more power, while radiation can also be an issue, astrophysicist Jonathan McDowell told AFP.</p>

<p>"To date, the highest inclination achieved by human spaceflight has been the Soviet Vostok 6 mission, at 65 degrees," according to the mission website.</p>

<p>The poles are not visible from the International Space Station (ISS).</p>

<p>The mission will use a SpaceX Dragon capsule equipped with an observation dome. The craft will fly at an altitude of between 265 and 280 miles (425 and 450 kilometers), according to SpaceX, owned by mercurial billionaire Elon Musk.</p>

<p>The crew plans to conduct research including taking the first X-ray images in space and studying an aurora-like light phenomenon, according to SpaceX.</p>

<p>SpaceX has flown 13 manned missions in the last four years. It carries Nasa astronauts to the ISS, but has also carried out several space tourism missions, including the first in 2021, named Inspiration4, financed by American billionaire Jared Isaacman.</p>

<p>"Until 2021, space missions were solely the privilege of governments," Mr Wang wrote, adding: "Then @inspiration4x came along and changed everything."</p>

<p>SpaceX is set to launch another private mission, Polaris Dawn on August 26, carrying four crew members including Isaacman.</p>

<p>It is scheduled to include the first private spacewalk.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pakistan's jailed former premier on Tuesday termed the arrest of former ISI chief Faiz Hameed as an "internal issue" of the military and said that the army's action against the former general has nothing to do with his party.</p>

<p>Mr Hameed served as the director general of Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) from 2019 to 2021, when Mr Khan was prime minister and was accused of meddling in political affairs at his behest.</p>

<p>"Imran Khan sahib said just this that 'it is the army's internal matter' and that whatever action the army has taken has nothing to do with the PTI or Khan sahib," Mr Khan's legal representative Intezar Panjutha said.</p>

<p>Mr Panjutha made these remarks following a meeting of Mr Khan with his senior lawyers at Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi.</p>

<p>Mr Panjutha quoted Mr Khan as saying it was purely a military matter, with no links to PTI. He further clarified that there had been no political connection between Mr Khan and Gen Faiz.</p>

<p>Mr Khan also claimed that former army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa had replaced Gen Faiz after making a deal with Nawaz Sharif, according to the lawyer.</p>

<p>Mr Khan also suggested that if General Faiz's arrest was related to the events of May 9, it would be an opportune moment to form a judicial commission and bring the CCTV footage of the day to light, Panjutha noted.</p>

<p>He also stated that the former premier urged his followers to peacefully protest tonight for the sake of freedom, stressing the importance of taking to the streets for the country.</p>

<p>Mr Panjutha also highlighted Mr Khan's concerns over the mounting pressure on the Supreme Court, the disillusionment among the youth, and the deteriorating conditions in Pakistan, comparing them with those in Bangladesh.</p>

<p>He stated that Mr Khan believed it was time for Chief Justice Qazi Faez Isa to step back, highlighting that PTI's three seats were allegedly taken away the previous day.</p>

<p>Earlier, in an unprecedented move, Mr Hameed was detained by military authorities and court martial proceedings were initiated against him on charges of corruption, misuse of authority and violating the Pakistan Army Act.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>British authorities have now arrested more than 1,000 people following days of rioting involving violence, arson and looting as well as racist attacks targeting Muslims and migrants, a national policing body said on Tuesday.</p>

<p>The riots, which followed the killings of three young girls in the northern English town of Southport, began after the July 29 attack was wrongly blamed on an Islamist migrant based on online misinformation.</p>

<p>Violence broke out in cities across England and also in Northern Ireland, but there have been fewer instances of unrest since last week after efforts to identify those involved were ramped up.</p>

<p>Many have been swiftly jailed, with some receiving long sentences</p>

<p>The National Police Chiefs' Council said in its latest update that 1,024 had been arrested and 575 charged across the UK.</p>

<p>Those arrested include a 69-year-old accused of vandalism in Liverpool and a 11-year-old boy in Belfast.</p>

<p>A 13-year-old girl pleaded guilty to violent disorder at Basingstoke Magistrates' Court, prosecutors said, having been seen on July 31 punching and kicking the entrance to a hotel for asylum seekers.</p>

<p>"This alarming incident will have caused genuine fear amongst people who were being targeted by these thugs - and it is particularly distressing to learn that such a young girl participated in this violent disorder," prosecutor Thomas Power said.</p>

<p>The last time Britain witnessed widespread rioting was in 2011, when the fatal shooting of a Black man by police triggered several days of street violence.</p>

<p>Fast and tough judicial action was viewed as helping quell the unrest in 2011, when around 4,000 people were arrested over several weeks.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Antarctica, the world's coldest continent, is experiencing an exceptionally long heatwave during its winter, according to Britain's national polar research institute.</p>

<p>Temperature anomalies are not unusual on the continent known as "The Ice" but "the longevity of the warm period is unusual", Thomas Caton Harrison, Polar Climate Scientist at British Antarctic Survey, said to AFP this week.</p>

<p>Provisional figures indicate the Antarctic-wide July 2024 average near-surface temperature was 3.1 degrees Celsius above normal for the month.</p>

<p>Calculated over land and land ice, this makes it the second warmest July in Antarctica since records began in 1979 -- the warmest was in July 1981.</p>

<p>Average daily temperatures ranged from -34.68C on July 15 to -28.12C on July 31, according to data posted online by the University of Maine.</p>

<p>It was -26.6C on average on the continent on August 7, the latest date available.</p>

<p>The July average temperature anomaly even reached 9-10C over limited parts of Dronning Maud Land and part of the eastern Weddell Sea offshore.</p>

<p>Daily temperature anomalies often occur during the Antarctica's winter, but "what is remarkable is prolonged high temperatures", said Caton Harrison.</p>

<p>"Very early figures suggest it could be on track to be an exceptionally warm Antarctic winter," he added.</p>

<p>"The Ice" is the coldest, windiest, and least populated continent on the planet, but it too is impacted by global warming.</p>

<p>Extreme heat on the continent has high stakes, notably as a trigger for greater ice loss.</p>

<p>According to a study published in June in the journal Nature Geoscience, scientists have discovered a new tipping point toward "runaway melting" of Antarctic ice sheets, caused by warm ocean water intruding between the ice and the land it sits on.</p>

<p>With the rise of ocean temperatures due to human-caused global warming, Antarctic ice sheets are melting, threatening a rise in global sea levels and putting coastal communities at risk.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>General Secretary of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), Mirza Islam Alamgir, has expressed his party's desire to strengthen ties with India and emphasized that India is considered a neighbour and friend, but also called for a resolution of several key issues.</p>

<p>While speaking to news agency ANI, Mr Alamgir said that the BNP wants a friendly relationship with India, and is seeking solutions to these issues to move forward.</p>

<p>"It will be definitely strengthened further because we as a political party, always consider India to be our neighbour and friend. But we also invite India to come to a solution on certain issues," said Mr Alamgir</p>

<p>"We want a good friendly relationship with India," he added.</p>

<p>Further, Mr Alamgir has denied reports of communal atrocities against Hindus in Bangladesh.</p>

<p>Mr Alamgir claimed that the issues are "totally political" and not communal or religious. He invited Indian media to visit Dhaka to assess the situation themselves.</p>

<p>"There is a sort of misunderstanding and very unfortunate propaganda being made by different media nationally and globally and especially from your country. The media is peddling that communal atrocities are going on in Bangladesh which is not true at all. This is not communal, not religious, this is totally political to some extent. I invite you, the media of India to come to Dhaka and see themselves, what has happened in Bangladesh," said Mr Alamgir while referring to the attacks on Hindus in Bangladesh.</p>

<p>Further, Mr Alamgir accused the government of perpetuating a "political conspiracy" against the interim government and the people.</p>

<p>"Some people say that the people of Bangladesh are creating some communal problems. No not at all. They are safe in the hands of the Bangladeshi government, Bangladeshi people, they're always safe. This is again a political conspiracy going on against the interim government and the people because the people do not want anymore the government of Sheikh Hasina who has killed so many people in these few years and destroyed the constitution. They have violated human rights and corruption was rampant and unprecedented," the General Secretary of BNP said to ANI.</p>

<p>Mr Alamgir also spoke about the situation when Sheikh Hasina resigned and fled from the country and stated that she fled to Delhi, India, under "special circumstances" following a student and citizen uprising.</p>

<p>"Former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has resigned and fled from the country abandoning her party and the people. She was supposed to be with the people always but she left the country. As far as our knowledge goes, she has landed in Delhi. She had to leave under special circumstances," he said.</p>

<p>"There was a student and citizen uprising. It was a revolution and before that, almost 1,000 students were killed by Sheikh Hasina's police and almost 12,000 people were arrested... Millions of people were on the streets and they were heading towards the official residence of the Prime Minister and then she left the country with her helicopter," he added.</p>

<p>Bangladesh is experiencing a volatile political situation, with Sheikh Hasina resigning from the post of Prime Minister on August 5 amid mounting protests. The protests, led mainly by students demanding an end to a quota system for government jobs, evolved into anti-government demonstrations.</p>

<p>It is the latest in Banksy's series populating the British capital with animals, starting with a goat revealed last week Monday, followed by two elephants the next day and then monkeys, a wolf, pelicans, a cat, piranhas and a rhinoceros in subsequent days.</p>

<p>The frequency of artworks is unusual for Banksy -- whose identity is publicly unknown -- and who usually spaces out his pieces over months, leaving fans speculating about the meaning of the different animals and awaiting a "big" reveal.</p>

<p>The latest mural was "an absolute shock and surprise to all of us here at London Zoo", Karl Penman, commercial operations manager at the zoo said.</p>

<p>"If it is the full stop, what a great full stop to end on," Penman told AFP.</p>

<p>The BBC reported the that piece was the last in the series.</p>

<p>"You can see the watchful eyes, which to me look a little bit uncertain about whether they want to be free," said doctor Sharmela Darne about the eyes of animals staring from behind the shutter in the latest artwork.</p>

<p>"But the seal's clearly going away and so are the birds flying free... so maybe it's about freedom and being unsure about freedom," Darne told AFP.</p>

<p>For many, the animal safari has added some positivity to their week, as the country reeled following the death of three girls in a stabbing and ensuing violent riots.</p>

<p>Speaking in front of two pelicans painted over a fish shop in Walthamstow, northeast London, Peter McCarthy said it had been "very nice to have it in this particular week".</p>

<p>"Very nice that he's been around the country when there's been such trouble. Doing these wonderful things."</p>

<p><strong>Removed</strong></p>

<p>For others, the choice of animals has meaning, with some finding the goat similar to a Palestinian mountain gazelle and others pointing out the artist's previous work on the climate crisis.</p>

<p>Three of the artworks have already been removed or stolen, and the rhino revealed on Monday was defaced the same day.</p>

<p>A satellite dish painted with the wolf was stolen within hours of being claimed by Banksy, with the cat on a billboard removed by contractors and a police box painted with swimming piranhas removed by the local authority to ensure it was "properly protected".</p>

<p>Speaking in front of the cat on Saturday before it was removed, dentist Mitul Patel said he wished "people would leave his work alone so that other people could enjoy it as well".</p>

<p>Locals and tourists alike have been enjoying the artworks that are still up.</p>

<p>Taking a brief pause from his job, construction worker Owen said the three monkeys in east London's Shoreditch area were "very exciting" and a "big talking point".</p>

<p>Kevin Mazur, a photographer visiting from the US, said he had been "running around photographing all" the artworks, and was "bummed" about having to return to New York.</p>

<p>Retiree Don Gould lives around the corner from the goat in southwest London's Kew Green, and saw the artwork after it was revealed online last week. "It's very good excuse for a stroll on the green and a pint, isn't it?"</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bangladesh's Army Chief Gen Waker-Uz-Zaman on Tuesday disclosed that they have given shelter to some influential people of the ousted Awami League government to prevent any attack or extrajudicial action against them.</p>

<p>Speaking at Rajshahi Cantonment, where he met with officials of the army, police, and administration, Gen Zaman said they gave shelter to those people irrespective of their party affiliation, opinion and religion, the Daily Star newspaper reported.</p>

<p>"If there is any allegation against them, any case is filed, they will be punished. But of course, we don't want any attack or extrajudicial action (against them). We have given them shelter because of the threat to their lives," he said in response to a query.</p>

<p>His comments came on a day when former law minister Anisul Huq and Salman F Rahman, private industry and investment affairs adviser to the former prime minister Sheikh Hasina, were arrested in Dhaka.</p>

<p>Former foreign minister Hassan Mahmud and ex-state minister Zunaid Ahmed Palak were arrested last week at the Dhaka airport while attempting to flee the country after Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina resigned and fled the country following deadly protests against her government.</p>

<p>According to reports, several top leaders and lawmakers of Hasina's Awami League and cabinet ministers have left the country. Several other ministers left their official or private residences and are believed to be hiding in safe places.</p>

<p>Asked about any possibility of a counter-revolution, the army chief said he had no knowledge of it.</p>

<p>Asked about any pressure from foreign nations regarding the situation, he replied in the negative. "... this is a unique situation. Everyone understands it. There has been some discussion over the minority issue. A total of 30 minority-related attacks have taken place in 20 districts," he said.</p>

<p>"We are looking into the incidents. We will bring the criminals to book," he added.</p>

<p>"The situation has become normal. But the police are still in trauma. Once it's over, the police will be able to perform their duties properly again," the army chief said.</p>

<p>"Police have already started working in different police stations. We are giving protection to the police. When they start functioning fully, the situation will become normal. Then we will return to the cantonment," he added.</p>

<p>"We will provide all-out help to the government. The government wants some reform, and to hold a free and fair election. We will provide all sorts of assistance in this regard," he said replying to another query.</p>

<p>The army chief said many looted arms of police have already been recovered. More will be recovered soon more in the days ahead.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

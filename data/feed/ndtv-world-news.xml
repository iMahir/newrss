       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tens of thousands of people in Australia's southern island state of Tasmania were without power on Sunday after a cold front brought damaging winds and heavy rains, sparking flood warnings.</p>

<p>"Around 30,000 customers are without power across the state this morning," Tasnetworks, a state-owned power company, said on Facebook on Sunday.</p>

<p>The nation's weather forecaster said on its website that a cold front over Tasmania, population around 570,000 people, was moving away, "although bands of showers and thunderstorms continue to pose a risk of damaging wind gusts."</p>

<p>Properties, power lines and infrastructure had been damaged, Tasmania's emergency management minister Felix Ellis said in a televised media conference, adding that "the damage bill is likely to be significant".</p>

<p>Emergency authorities issued warnings for flooding, which they said could leave Tasmanians isolated for several days, as the state prepared for another cold front forecast to hit on Sunday night.</p>

<p>"There is potential for properties to be inundated, and roads may not be accessible," executive director of Tasmania State Emergency Service, Mick Lowe, said in a statement.</p>

<p>Authorities had received 330 requests for assistance in the last 24 hours, according to the agency.</p>

<p>Tasmania is a one-hour flight or 10-hour ferry crossing from the mainland city of Melbourne, 445 km (275 miles) away. About 40% of the island is wilderness or protected areas.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Judicial reforms championed by Mexico's outgoing president, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, and supported by his incoming successor have sparked diplomatic tensions with the United States and upset financial markets.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Judicial reforms championed by Mexico's outgoing president, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, and supported by his incoming successor have sparked diplomatic tensions with the United States and upset financial markets.</p>

<p>Here are the key points of the proposals, which will be debated in the ruling-party-dominated Congress, due to convene on Sunday:</p>

<h3><strong>What's the plan?&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Lopez Obrador wants the Supreme Court and other judges and magistrates to be elected by popular vote, arguing that the judiciary now serves the interests of the political and economic elite.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Candidates would be proposed by the executive, legislative and judicial branches of government.</p>

<p>At present, Supreme Court justices are nominated by the president and ratified by the Senate.</p>

<p>Judges and magistrates are appointed by the Federal Judicial Council, an administrative body.</p>

<p>The proposals, which are supported by president-elect Claudia Sheinbaum, who will take office on October 1, would reduce the number of Supreme Court judges from 11 to nine.</p>

<p>Their terms of office would be shortened from 15 years to 12.</p>

<p>A new body would be formed to supervise judges, in a country where the rate of impunity -- of being able to avoid accountability for crimes -- stands at 99 per cent, according to the non-governmental organization Impunidad Cero.</p>

<p>The system would have similarities to that of Bolivia, where members of the high courts are elected by popular vote.</p>

<p>Some states in the United States use elections to select judges. In Switzerland, judges are chosen by voters at the local level.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Why the controversy?</strong></h3>

<p>Opposition politicians, judges and judicial employees say that the reforms would politicize the justice system and compromise the separation of powers between the branches of government.</p>

<p>Margaret Satterthwaite, United Nations special rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, has also voiced "deep concerns" about the plan's "broad implications for judicial independence across Mexico."</p>

<p>"I urge the authorities to carefully reconsider the proposal, giving appropriate weight to the human rights guarantee of judicial independence," she wrote on social media platform X.</p>

<p>Human Rights Watch urged lawmakers to reject what it called the "dangerous proposals," saying they would "seriously undermine judicial independence and contravene international human rights standards."</p>

<p>The New York-based rights group expressed concern that the reforms would also eliminate restrictions on the military carrying out civilian law enforcement.</p>

<p>"Given Mexico's long history of serious human rights violations and official cover-ups, legislators should be taking steps to strengthen human rights protections, not weaken them," it said.</p>

<h3><strong>What's the diplomatic fallout?&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>US Ambassador to Mexico Ken Salazar has warned that the changes would "threaten" a trade relationship between the neighbouring countries that "relies on investors' confidence in Mexico's legal framework."</p>

<p>The reforms could pose "a major risk to the functioning of Mexico's democracy," he told journalists.</p>

<p>In particular, they could "make it easier for cartels and other bad actors to take advantage of politically motivated and inexperienced judges," Salazar said.</p>

<p>Canada, also a member of the major free trade partnership with the United States and Mexico, has for its part said investors are worried.</p>

<p>"They want stability, they want a judicial system that works if there are problems," Canadian Ambassador Graeme Clark said.</p>

<p>In response, Lopez Obrador announced a "pause" in relations with the US and Canadian embassies, criticizing the ambassadors' statements as "interventionist."</p>

<h3><strong>Why are markets nervous?&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Several investment firms have warned that curbing the independence of the judiciary would affect the resolution of conflicts between the government and the private sector.</p>

<p>The changes would "lead to heightened uncertainty" about the legal operating environment, British consultancy firm Capital Economics wrote in a note to clients.</p>

<p>"The politicization of the justice system could raise concerns about whether disputes between businesses and the government would be resolved in an impartial manner," it said.</p>

<p>Since Sheinbaum, a close ally of Lopez Obrador, won a landslide election victory on June 2, the Mexican peso has fallen by around 16 per cent against the dollar.</p>

<p>The drop reflects "concerns about the country's economic stability... and also the perception of risk that foreign investors are beginning to attribute to Mexico," Ramse Gutierrez, co-director of investments at asset manager Franklin Templeton, told AFP.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Israeli military announced today that it had discovered the bodies of six hostages in an underground tunnel in the southern Gaza Strip. Among the dead were dual citizens, including a US-Israeli and a Russian-Israeli. The Israeli military claimed that the hostages were brutally murdered by Hamas shortly before security forces could reach them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The hostages, whose identities have been confirmed as Carmel Gat, Eden Yerushalmi, Hersh Goldberg-Polin, Alexander Lobanov, Almog Sarusi, and Ori Danino, were kidnapped by Hamas militants during their brutal attack on southern Israel on October 7. The attack not only triggered the ongoing war but also led to the kidnapping of 251 individuals, of whom 97 remain captive, including 33 who the Israeli army believes are dead.</p>

<p>"A few hours ago, we informed the families that the bodies of their loved ones had been located by IDF troops in an underground tunnel in Rafah. According to our initial assessment, they were brutally murdered by Hamas terrorists shortly before we reached them," Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">This is a very difficult morning here in Israel.<br />

<p>The hostages were reportedly taken alive on October 7, and their bodies were discovered during combat operations in Rafah, approximately one kilometre from a tunnel where another hostage, Farhan Alkadi, had been rescued just days earlier. Hagari claimed that the IDF had been operating under extreme caution, knowing that additional hostages might be held in the area. However, they lacked precise information on the hostages' exact location.</p>

<p>The discovery of the bodies came amidst ongoing combat in Rafah, where IDF troops continued to engage with Hamas fighters.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"This morning, our hearts are broken alongside the families of Ori Danino, Alex Lobanov, Almog Sarusi, Hersh Goldberg-Polin, Carmel Gat, and Eden Yerushalmi," Hagari said. "It is impossible to put into words what the hostages have endured in Hamas captivity since October 7th, now 331 days, and what their families have been going through. This morning, this news shakes us all."</p>

<p>Among the six victims, Gat was abducted from the southern Israeli kibbutz community of Beeri and the others, aged between 23 and 32, taken from a music festival near the Gaza border.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden said he was "devastated and outraged" over the recovery of six bodies of hostages, including that of an Israeli-American from the Gaza Strip.</p>

<p>Terming the development as "tragic" and "reprehensible" Biden on August 31 unequivocally warned that "Hamas leaders will pay for these crimes" while vowing to keep working around the clock for a deal to secure the release of remaining hostages held by the Palestine group.</p>

<p>The US President said Israeli forces had on Saturday recovered six bodies of hostages held by Hamas in a tunnel under the city of Rafah.</p>

<p>"We have now confirmed that one of the hostages killed by these vicious Hamas terrorists was an American citizen, Hersh Goldberg-Polin, Biden said in a statement released by the White House.</p>

<p>The Israel Defence Force (IDF) Spokesman, Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, was cited by Times of Israel as saying that the six hostages recovered from southern Gaza's Rafah were "brutally murdered" by Hamas shortly before IDF troops arrived.</p>

<p>Talking to reporters after leaving a church in Delaware, Biden said, "It's time this war ended." "We should end this war."</p>

<p>Vice President Kamala Harris said in a statement that Hamas "must be eliminated" and cannot be allowed to control Gaza.</p>

<p>Harris extended her condolences to 23-year-old American citizen Goldberg-Polin's parents Jon and Rachel, and declared, "I have no higher priority than the safety of American citizens, wherever they are in the world. President Biden and I will never waver in our commitment to free the Americans and all those held hostage in Gaza."</p>

<p>"Hamas is an evil terrorist organisation. With these murders, Hamas has even more American blood on its hands. I strongly condemn Hamas' continued brutality, and so must the entire world. From its massacre of 1,200 people to sexual violence, taking of hostages, and these murders, Hamas' depravity is evident and horrifying," she said in a White House statement.</p>

<p>Goldberg Polin was held hostage while he was trying to escape terrorists who infiltrated the Nova music festival and lost his hand in a grenade blast in the October 7 attacks.</p>

<p>Israel President Isaac Herzog said in a statement that the "heart of an entire nation is crushed into pieces". He said the killing of the hostages "proves Hamas's readiness to carry out crimes against humanity." He added the country's "sacred goal" was to bring them home.</p>

<p>Following Hamas attacks on October 7, Israel launched a war against the Palestinian group, in which more than 1,200 Israelis were killed and 250 taken hostage, according to Israeli authorities as per reports.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Germans head to the polls in two eastern states on Sunday, with the far-right AfD on track to win a state election for the first time and Chancellor Olaf Scholz's coalition set to receive a drubbing just a year before federal elections.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Germans head to the polls in two eastern states on Sunday, with the far-right AfD on track to win a state election for the first time and Chancellor Olaf Scholz's coalition set to receive a drubbing just a year before federal elections.</p>

<p>The Alternative for Germany is polling first on 30% in Thuringia and neck-and-neck with the conservatives in Saxony on 30-32%. A win would mark the first time a far-right party has the most seats in a German state parliament since World War Two.</p>

<p>The 11-year-old party would be unlikely to be able to form a state government even if it does win, as it is polling short of a majority and other parties refuse to collaborate with it.</p>

<p>But a strong showing for the AfD and another populist party, the newly-created Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance (BSW), named after its founder, a former communist, would complicate coalition building.</p>

<p>Both parties are anti-migration, eurosceptic, and Russia-friendly and are particularly strong in the former Communist-run East, where concerns about a cost of living crisis, the Ukraine war and immigration run deep.</p>

<p>A deadly stabbing spree linked to Islamic State 10 days ago stoked concerns about immigration in particular and criticism of the government's handling of the issue.</p>

<p>"Our freedoms are being increasingly restricted because people are being allowed into the country who don't fit in," the AfD's leader in Thuringia, Bjoern Hoecke, said at a campaign event in Nordhausen on Thursday.</p>

<p>The former history teacher is a polarizing figure who has called Berlin's memorial to Nazi Germany's Holocaust of Europe's Jews a "monument of shame" and was convicted earlier this year for using a Nazi slogan at a party rally.</p>

<h3><strong>'POLITICAL EARTHQUAKE'</strong></h3>

<p>All three parties in Scholz's federal coalition are seen losing votes on Sunday, with the Greens and liberal Free Democrats likely to struggle to reach the 5% threshold to enter parliament.</p>

<p>Discontent with the federal government stems partly from the fact it is an ideologically heterogeneous coalition plagued by infighting. A rout in the East will only fuel tensions in Berlin, analysts say.</p>

<p>"The state elections ..have the potential to trigger an earthquake in Berlin," Wagenknecht told a campaign rally in Erfurt, the capital of Thuringia, on Thursday.</p>

<p>Political analysts say Scholz's coalition is unlikely to disband before the next federal election in September 2025 as none of the partners currently expect a good result.</p>

<p>The BSW, which defines itself as socially conservative and economically leftwing, has seen a stellar rise since its creation in January, posing a particular threat to Scholz's centre-left Social Democrats.</p>

<p>The party is expected to win up to 12-20% on Sunday which could put it in a kingmaker position in both states. Its foreign policy views would make it an unlikely partner for any of the mainstream parties at the national level but is winning its votes.</p>

<p>"I especially like her stance on the Ukraine war, we can't simply keep delivering weapons," said BSW supporter Carola Gustavus at the event in Erfurt. "One has to negotiate even with the worst opponent."</p>

<p>The AfD and BSW together are expected to take some 40-50% of the vote in the two states compared with 23-27.5% at a national level, laying bare the continuing divide between East and West more than 30 years after reunification.</p>

<p>Party allegiance is lower in the East while scepticism of Germany's democratic structures and affinity with Russia are greater.</p>

<p>Moreover, narrowing economic differences with the West and a recent string of high-profile multi-billion euro investments in sectors such as the chipmaking and electric car industries have failed to cheer locals.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>US President Joe Biden also confirmed that body of Hersh Goldberg-Polin was among those found in the Gaza tunnels.</p>

<p>"Earlier today, in a tunnel under the city of Rafah, Israeli forces recovered six bodies of hostages held by Hamas," Biden said in a statement.</p>

<p>"We have now confirmed that one of the hostages... was an American citizen, Hersh Goldberg-Polin," the president added.</p>

<p>The 23-year-old was among 251 hostages caught during the October 7 attack on southern Israel by Hamas terrorists. About 250 people were abducted on October 7 when Hamas stormed into Israel, killing 1,200 people. More than 100 hostages were freed during a cease-fire late last year.</p>

<p>The parents of Goldberg-Polin, who was abducted from the Supernova music festival, addressed delegates at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago last month.</p>

<p>On Thursday, the couple joined other relatives of hostages rallying near the Gaza border. "Hersh! It's Mom... I love you, stay strong, survive," Rachel Goldberg-Polin shouted into a microphone.</p>

<p>Her son had hidden in a bomb shelter with other people on October 7 but it was surrounded by gunmen, who attacked it with grenades.</p>

<p>A Hamas video from the day showed him being loaded onto a pick-up truck with part of his left arm, which was blown off in the attack, missing.</p>

<p>He appeared in a proof-of-life video released by Hamas on April 24 in which he said the captives were living "in hell". His left arm had been amputated below the elbow.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>He appeared in a proof-of-life video released by Hamas on April 24 in which he said the captives were living "in hell". His left arm had been amputated below the elbow.</p>

<p>Hamas's October 7 attack resulted in the deaths of 1,199 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory military campaign has killed at least 40,691 people in Gaza, according to the territory's health ministry. The UN rights office says most of the dead are women and children.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Shanghai Museum has pulled in crowds this summer for an exhibition of ancient Egyptian relics including cat statues and other feline imagery, which on Saturday nights allows up to 200 visitors to bring along their own four-legged friends.</p>

<p>Inspired by ancient Egyptians' worship of Bastet, the goddess of protection - often depicted as a cat - the museum has given cats the chance to interact with part of the exhibition called "The Secrets of Saqqara".</p>

<p>"Egyptian archaeological teams discovered a cat temple in Saqqara and unearthed many cat mummies and cat statues. So when we were planning the event, we had cats as a theme, and then came the idea for 'Meow Night'," said Shanghai Museum Deputy Director Li Feng.</p>

<p>The "Top of the Pyramids: Ancient Egyptian Civilization Exhibition" began on July 19 and runs until Aug. 17, 2025, with "Meow Night" planned for at least 10 Saturdays. It has held six so far with tickets, including 200 bring-a-cat tickets, selling out each time.</p>

<p>Visitors bring their cats in carriers or pet strollers and can take them out only at designated areas, such as for a photo opportunity next to a statue of Bastet.</p>

<p>The cats are checked on entry to ensure up-to-date vaccinations and for signs of illness or stress. There are veterinarians onsite and rest areas for cats in case the stimulation from their night at the museum gets a bit much.</p>

<p>"It's very special that you can bring a cat with you," said visitor Qiu Jiakai who was attending "Meow Night" with one-year-old puss An Mao.</p>

<p>"I listened to the narrator's introduction saying ... many of today's pet cats are related to the cats domesticated in ancient Egypt. So I thought I would have to bring my cat here to see its ancestors and the cat goddess," she said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Do not leave the building, or take a coffee break - these are among the new instructions an Australian mining boss plans to give all his employees. The billionaire said this was costing their company a fortune and hence they plan to "hold staff captive all day long".</p>

<p>Chris Ellison, the managing director of Mineral Resources, has announced that his company will install amenities at their head office in Perth which ensures that employees do not leave the building during their work hours.</p>

<p>During a financial results presentation, Ellison expressed his disapproval of staff leaving the building to buy coffee or work from home, stating that it's costing the company too much money.</p>

<p>"I want to hold them captive all day long. I don't want them leaving the building. I don't want them walking down the road for a cup of coffee. We kind of figured out a few years ago how much that costs."</p>

<p>He also criticised other companies that allow remote work, despite the trend towards more flexible work arrangements since the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>To keep employees in the office, Mineral Resources has invested in amenities such as a restaurant, gym, staff psychologists, and even a creche, which costs just 20 dollars a day. Ellison believes that these facilities will make the head office a desirable place to be, eliminating the need for staff to leave.</p>

<p>The company formally banned work-from-home arrangements last year, and Ellison is urging other businesses to follow suit. He also expressed concerns about the trend towards shorter working weeks, stating that the industry cannot afford to have employees working fewer days while receiving full pay.</p>

<p>"The industry cannot afford it. We can't have people working three days a week and picking up five days a week pay - or four days," he said.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Preliminary investigations suggest that asphyxiation due to oxygen deprivation was the probable cause of death.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thai authorities have confirmed the deaths of three foreign workers who were trapped in a collapsed train tunnel for over five days, despite extensive rescue efforts, <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn49gwexqy1o" rel="nofollow, noindex">BBC</a></em> reported. The victims, comprising two Chinese nationals and one Myanmar citizen, were initially believed to have survived until Thursday. However, on Friday, authorities announced all three had died.&nbsp;All three bodies were found about 25 metres from the point of the tunnel collapse, officials said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The victims have been identified as Chinese project supervisor Hu Siang Min, Chinese backhoe driver Dong Chinlin, and a truck driver from Myanmar whose identity was yet to be confirmed, <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.independent.co.uk/asia/southeast-asia/thailand-tunnel-collapse-dead-chinese-national-b2604301.html" rel="nofollow, noindex">Independent</a></em> reported. Preliminary investigations suggest that asphyxiation due to oxygen deprivation was the probable cause of death, as announced by officials on Friday.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The tunnel, which was still under construction as part of the Thailand-China high-speed railway project, collapsed around 23:40 local time (16:40 GMT) last Saturday due to a landslide.&nbsp;To save the trapped workers, a dedicated team of rescuers from the State Railway of Thailand (SRT) and a specialised Chinese disaster response team worked tirelessly around the clock for over a week.&nbsp;They tried to pump oxygen into the tunnel to keep the workers alive, but it is unclear whether the tubes they used reached the workers at all.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Advanced scanners and trained sniffer dogs had also detected faint vital signs, suggesting that the trapped workers might still be clinging to life. However, the rescue operation was slow due to the treacherous conditions caused by the ongoing landslide. Rescuers faced a constant battle as falling debris and dirt continually filled in the holes they painstakingly dug, blocking their path.&nbsp;The rescue teams also had to be extremely careful while digging&nbsp;so that it would not cause other parts of the tunnel to collapse.</p>

<p>Anutin Charnvirakul, Thailand's caretaker Interior Minister, noted that rescue efforts were limited by the challenging engineering conditions.</p>

<p>"Nobody wanted [this incident] to happen. "We did not only try to save the lives of the victims, but we also had to [ensure the safety] of the rescuers and workers," he said at a press conference on Friday.</p>

<p>The state railways company offered its condolences to the victims' families and said it was ''ready to assist the families of the deceased''.</p>

<p>Following the tragic incident, the Thai authorities have launched a comprehensive investigation into the tunnel collapse. In the meantime, all construction activities in the vicinity of the tunnel have been temporarily suspended.&nbsp;</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former US President Donald Trump's dance moves at a public event on Friday have taken social media by storm. The annual Moms for Liberty event, held in Washington DC, saw 78-year-old Tump shake a leg on stage with the group's co-founder.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Trump just ended his Moms For Liberty event with his impressive dance moves! Moms love Donald Trump! Kamala (Harris) definitely doesn't want you to share this!" posted a Trump supporter with the video.&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">?TRUMP JUST ENDED HIS MOMS FOR LIBERTY EVENT WITH HIS IMPRESSIVE DANCE MOVES!<br />
<br />
MOMS LOVE DONALD TRUMP!<br />
<br />
Kamala definitely doesn't want you to share this! <a href="https://t.co/EV5BNLsyKM">pic.twitter.com/EV5BNLsyKM</a></p>
— Bo Loudon (@BoLoudon) <a href="https://twitter.com/BoLoudon/status/1829702054383640916?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 31, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p>The internet is divided over the dance video. While some cheered Trump for being able to dance at the age of 78, some termed the entire episode as "comical".&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Trump is the people's president!" wrote one user.</p>

<p>"He's the worst version of the creepy, unstable uncle in the family," wrote another.</p>

<p>Moms for Liberty, a national group that has made strides within conservative circles, has been at the forefront of efforts to influence school curricula across the United States. The organisation has led initiatives to remove references to LGBTQ+ identities and discussions of structural racism from classrooms.</p>

<p>The Republican presidential frontrunner discussed issues surrounding these topics and did not shy away from making pointed political comments, particularly aimed at US Vice President Kamala Harris. In his address, Trump described her as a "defective person." He also expressed surprise at her limited media appearances, suggesting that her lack of interviews was indicative of her shortcomings as a leader. "I was surprised she didn't do a lot of interviews, but she's not good at it, I guess," Trump said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The US Presidential elections are scheduled to be held in November this year and is largely seen as a direct battle between Trump and Harris.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>More than 700 people arrested during protests that erupted after Venezuela's disputed presidential election have been transferred to maximum security prisons, a human rights group said Saturday.</p>

<p>The detainees, who had been held at police stations around the country, were transferred over the past week to two notorious prisons that were previously controlled by gangs, the Venezuelan Prisons Observatory said.</p>

<p>In many cases the transfers were conducted under questionable circumstances, with detainees' relatives not informed of the moves to Tocuyito and Tocoron prisons, the group said.</p>

<p>"They were conducted with many irregularities," the NGO said in a press release.</p>

<p>More than 2,400 people were arrested after the protests that broke out after President Nicolas Maduro was declared winner of the disputed July 28 election.</p>

<p>The opposition claims it won by a landslide and has voting records to prove this.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The leftist Maduro government, brushing off accusations of authoritarianism, has resisted intense international pressure to release vote tally numbers to back up its claim of victory.</p>

<p>The United States, the European Union and several Latin American countries have refused to recognize Maduro as having won without seeing detailed voting results.</p>

<p>The violence that accompanied the protests left 27 people dead and 192 injured.</p>

<p>Venezuelan Prisons Observatory said none of the people transferred to maximum security facilities have been allowed to contact their families or attorneys.</p>

<p>Of the 2,400 detainees, 1,581 have been listed as political prisoners by another advocacy group, called Penal Forum.</p>

<p>It said 114 of the total are adolescents and 18 of them were released on bail Saturday. This raised to 34 the number of youths freed from detention.</p>

<p>Some of those arrested are as young as 13 and have been sent to prisons with older, common criminals, opposition leader Maria Corina Machado said this week.</p>

<p>"What they have done is brutal," she said of the Maduro government.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A woman allegedly killed her boyfriend's 9-year-old daughter by thrashing her and making her Rottweiler dog attack the child at their home in US' Florida, police said.</p>

<p>Tyshael Elise Martin, 34, told police she had found Jamaria Sessions unresponsive when she went to wake her up for a family vacation to California on June 17.</p>

<p>But police suspected Martin's involvement in the girl's death as her body was found covered in cuts, burns, bruises and bite marks.</p>

<p>While checking the security footage inside their home, police found that the woman trying to let her Rottweiler dog loose on the unsuspecting child, even encouraging the dog to attack the little girl.</p>

<p>The footage then shows the dog "viciously attack" Jamaria even as Martin herself kept beating her.</p>

<p>In the video, she can be seen kicking the girl until she went limp and then dragging her across the floor and hitting her again.</p>

<p>At one point, the CCTV captures her saying she wants to murder the child. "I'm fixin' to kill her," she says.</p>

<p>Reports suggest the violence the 9-year-old faced was not new to her as she was frequently subjected to punishments like being struck with objects, prolonged wall sits and other forms of abuse.</p>

<p>Policemen who watched the video have called it the "the worst case of aggravated child abuse" they've ever seen. The brutal death has been devastating to family who said their "beautiful little girl was now gone.”</p>

<p>A case of murder, aggravated child abuse and child neglect have been filed against Martin. She was arrested and remains in jail.</p>

<p>Her death was ruled a homicide caused by blunt force trauma to the head and thermal injury to the foot.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A health official said a polio vaccination campaign began in Gaza on Saturday, while an aid worker said a large-scale rollout would begin on Sunday, coinciding with a "humanitarian pause" agreed by Israel and Hamas.</p>

<p>The vaccination drive was announced after Gaza recorded its first polio case in a quarter of a century earlier this month.</p>

<p>Local health officials along with the UN and NGOs "are starting today the polio vaccination campaign", Moussa Abed, director of primary health care at the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza, told AFP on Saturday.</p>

<p>An unspecified number of children received the first dose of the vaccination, which involves two doses and is administered orally, at Nasser Hospital in the southern city of Khan Yunis.</p>

<p>Among them was Amal Shaheen's three-year-old daughter, who was already in the hospital being treated for pneumonia.</p>

<p>"We have been in the hospital for 17 days... I spend all my days worrying about her," Shaheen said.</p>

<p>"Today she was vaccinated against polio to protect her, like all the children in the hospital have been vaccinated."</p>

<p>The World Health Organization (WHO) said on Thursday that Israel had agreed to a series of three-day "humanitarian pauses" in Gaza to facilitate vaccinations, though officials had earlier said the campaign was expected to start on Sunday.</p>

<h2><strong>'Not a ceasefire'</strong></h2>

<p>An international aid worker told AFP that Palestinian authorities had organised a launch event on Saturday and that the vaccination campaign was still expected to begin in full on Sunday.</p>

<p>COGAT, the Israeli defence ministry body which oversees civilian affairs in the Palestinian territories, said on Saturday that vaccines would be given daily from 6:00 am (0300 GMT) until 2:00 pm for three days in central Gaza, three days in southern Gaza and three days in northern Gaza.</p>

<p>"At the end of each regional vaccination campaign, a situational assessment will be conducted for the area," it said.</p>

<p>The Palestinian health ministry distributed a slightly different schedule, with the vaccine programme lasting four days in each location.</p>

<p>The ministry identified 67 vaccination centres -- mostly hospitals, smaller health centres and schools -- in central Gaza, 59 in southern Gaza and 33 in northern Gaza.</p>

<p>Poliovirus is highly infectious and most often spread through sewage and contaminated water -- an increasingly common problem in Gaza as the Israel-Hamas war drags on.</p>

<p>The media office of the Hamas-run government in Gaza said on Saturday that the vaccination campaign required an "immediate ceasefire".</p>

<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said measures to facilitate polio vaccination in Gaza are "not a ceasefire".</p>

<p>The campaign aims to cover more than 640,000 children under 10 years old.</p>

<p>Michael Ryan, WHO deputy director-general, told the UN Security Council this week that 1.26 million doses of the oral vaccine had been delivered in Gaza, with another 400,000 still to arrive</p>

<p>The Ramallah-based Palestinian health ministry said earlier this month that tests in Jordan had confirmed polio in an unvaccinated 10-month-old baby from central Gaza.</p>

<p>Poliovirus is highly infectious and most often spread through sewage and contaminated water -- an increasingly common problem in Gaza as the Israel-Hamas war drags on.</p>

<p>The disease mainly affects children under the age of five. It can cause deformities and paralysis and is potentially fatal.</p>

<h2><strong>'100 per cent safe'</strong></h2>

<p>Bakr Deeb told AFP on Saturday that he brought his three children -- all under 10 -- to a vaccination point on Saturday despite some initial doubts about its safety.</p>

<p>"I was hesitant at first and very afraid of the safety of this vaccination," he said.</p>

<p>"After the assurances of its safety, and with all the families going to the vaccination points, I decided to go with my children as well, to protect them."</p>

<p>Abed, the health official, stressed on Saturday that the vaccine was "100 percent safe".</p>

<p>The war in Gaza was triggered by Hamas's unprecedented attack on southern Israel on October 7 which resulted in the deaths of 1,199 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory military campaign has killed at least 40,691 people in Gaza, according to the territory's health ministry. The UN rights office says most of the dead are women and children.</p>

<p>Incessant Israeli bombardment has also caused a major humanitarian crisis and devastated the health system.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A beluga whale named Hvaldimir which captured the world's imagination in 2019 was found dead in Norway, a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/31/world/europe/hvaldimir-spy-whale-dead.htm">report</a> said. The 14-foot-long and 2,700-pound whale was spotted with a harness seemingly designed for a camera five years ago, prompting the internet to nickname him Hvaldimir the spy whale.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The harness bore the marking "equipment" from St. Petersburg, fueling widespread speculation that the whale was part of a Russian reconnaissance mission. The mystery deepened as no official claim of ownership was made by Russia, leaving the world to wonder if this whale was a spy or just an unfortunate whale caught in a strange circumstance.</p>

<p>The beluga, whose name is a blend of the Norwegian word for whale, "hval," and the Russian name Vladimir, quickly became a subject of global fascination. Unlike other belugas, which typically inhabit the remote and frigid Arctic waters, Hvaldimir appeared unusually comfortable around humans, leading experts to believe he had been in captivity for much of his life.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"It's heartbreaking. He's touched thousands of people's hearts just here in Norway," Sebastian Strand, founder of the nonprofit Marine Mind, which worked to protect Hvaldimir, said as quoted by the New York Times.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Last year, Norway requested its citizens to avoid any type of contact with Hvaldimir who was seen in a fjord close to Oslo.</p>

<p>"The white whale known as "Hvaldimir" now resides in the inner Oslofjord. This means that it has arrived in a very densely populated area, and the risk that the whale may be injured due to human contact has thus become significantly greater," a statement by the Norwegian Directorate of Fisheries read.&nbsp;<br />

<p>Israel's army on Saturday announced the first death of a soldier during its ongoing raid in the occupied West Bank that began four days ago.</p>

<p>An army statement said 20-year-old Elkana Navon "fell during operational activity" on Saturday and that another soldier was "severely injured" in the same incident, without providing details.</p>

<p>Since Wednesday at least 22 Palestinians have been killed by the Israeli army, most of them operatives, in simultaneous raids in several cities in the northern West Bank.</p>

<p>Since Friday, soldiers have concentrated their operations on the city of Jenin and its refugee camp, long a bastion of Palestinian armed groups fighting against Israel.</p>

<p>Violence has surged in the West Bank since Hamas's unprecedented October 7 attack on southern Israel triggered the war in the Gaza Strip.</p>

<p>The United Nations said on Wednesday that at least 637 Palestinians had been killed in the territory by Israeli troops or settlers since the Gaza war began.</p>

<p>Twenty Israelis, including soldiers, have been killed in Palestinian attacks or during army operations over the same period, according to Israeli official figures.</p>

<p>During a visit to Jenin on Saturday, Israeli army chief of staff Herzi Halevi said Israeli forces "have no intention of letting terrorism (in the West Bank) raise its head" to threaten Israel.</p>

<p>"Therefore the initiative is to go from city to city, refugee camp to refugee camp, with excellent intelligence, with very good operational capabilities, with a very strong air intelligence envelope... We will protect the citizens of Israel just like that."</p>

<p>Of the 22 Palestinians reported dead since Wednesday, Hamas and its ally Islamic Jihad have said at least 14 were members of their armed wings.</p>

<p>Earlier on Saturday, Hamas issued a statement saying one of its fighters carried out an "ambush" using "a highly explosive device" in the Jenin refugee camp "which led to the deaths and injuries of members of the advancing (Israeli) force".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>UNICEF said Saturday that it has launched an emergency tender for mpox vaccines to help countries hardest hit by the recent outbreak of the disease.</p>

<p>"The emergency tender is designed to secure immediate access to available mpox vaccines as well as to expand production," UNICEF said in a statement issued along with the World Health Organization, the Gavi vaccine alliance and Africa CDC (Centres for Disease Control and Prevention).</p>

<p>"Depending on demand, production capacity of manufacturers and funding, agreements for up to 12 million doses through 2025 can be put in place," it said.</p>

<p>Under the emergency tender, UNICEF plans to set up conditional supply agreements with vaccine manufacturers.</p>

<p>This "will enable UNICEF to purchase and ship vaccines without delay once countries and partners have secured financing, confirmed demand and readiness, and the regulatory requirements for accepting the vaccines are in place".</p>

<p>The WHO declared an international emergency over mpox on August 14, concerned by the surge in cases of the new Clade 1b strain in the Democratic Republic of Congo that spread to nearby countries.</p>

<p>More than 18,000 suspected cases of mpox have been reported in the DRC so far this year, with 629 deaths.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris said Saturday that her Republican rival Donald Trump "disrespected sacred ground" at a US military cemetery during a contentious pre-election visit.</p>

<p>Trump's presence at the hallowed Arlington National Cemetery -- intended to provide a campaign boost ahead of the November 5 vote -- has instead mushroomed into a public dispute consuming the candidates and the military.</p>

<p>"Let me be clear: the former president disrespected sacred ground, all for the sake of a political stunt," Harris said of Monday's incident at the cemetery near Washington, where Trump defied the rules and posed for photos with relatives of US service members killed in Afghanistan.</p>

<p>In one image, he is standing with family members of a fallen Marine, posing among headstones while grinning broadly and giving a thumbs-up.</p>

<p>"If there is one thing on which we as Americans can all agree, it is that our veterans, military families, and service members should be honored, never disparaged, and treated with nothing less than our highest respect and gratitude," Harris wrote on X.</p>

<p><strong>'Abruptly pushed aside'</strong></p>

<p>On Thursday, the US Army issued a rare statement confirming that a cemetery staff member had been "abruptly pushed aside" after asking Trump's team to stop filming in a burial section for those killed in recent wars, where photography for political purposes is banned.</p>

<p>Trump's campaign team has gone on the offensive by describing the employee as a "despicable individual" and claiming she was suffering a mental health episode.</p>

<p>But the military said the staff member had "acted with professionalism" and it condemned the incident as "unfortunate."</p>

<p>Trump has made criticism of the Biden-Harris administration's handling of the US retreat from Afghanistan a keynote of his campaign, arguing that he would have managed it better.</p>

<p>He visited the cemetery with families of some of the 13 service members killed in a 2021 bombing in Kabul during the last, chaotic hours of the US withdrawal.</p>

<p>Trump's relationship with the military has long spawned controversy.</p>

<p>While often touting his support for the armed forces, he privately mocked the war dead while he was president and did not want to be seen near military amputees, according to his former chief of staff.</p>

<p>Harris's blunt response Saturday over the cemetery incident appeared to underline her determination to take the fight directly to Trump in what is shaping up to be a bruising presidential election.</p>

<p>Trump has repeatedly mocked Harris's name, intelligence, appearance and racial identity, while the Harris campaign has replied that the former president is "weird," an aspiring dictator, and "out of his mind."</p>

<p>Harris earlier faced withering criticism over the cemetery incident from Trump's running mate, Senator J.D. Vance, who has launched a series of fierce attacks against the vice president.</p>

<p>Apparently responding to a mistaken report that Harris had already reacted to the cemetery visit, Vance accused her of feigning outrage and said, "She can go to hell."</p>

<p>"Don't focus on Donald Trump showing up to grieve with some people who lost their children. Focus on your own job. Don't do this fake outrage thing," he later told the Washington Post.</p>

<p>At that point Harris had not publicly mentioned the cemetery visit.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Seven people, including a six-year-old and 16-year-old, were killed when a bus overturned east of Vicksburg, Mississippi, early Saturday, Warren County Coroner Doug Huskey said.</p>

<p>The two young victims were siblings, according to the coroner.</p>

<p>The Mississippi Highway Patrol said the incident took place around 12:40 a.m. on Interstate 20 near Bovina in Warren County when a 2018 Volvo commercial passenger bus traveling westbound left the roadway and overturned.</p>

<p>Thirty-seven passengers were transported to different hospitals with unknown injuries, the agency said. It said the co-driver was not transported.</p>

<p>"Anytime you have people injured or killed, it's tragic but when you have a situation like this where you have multiple fatalities and multiple injuries, it makes it even worse," Warren County Sheriff Martin Pace told an ABC affiliate.</p>

<p>Huskey said most of the passengers on the bus were Latin American.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>an said early on Wednesday that its missile attack on Israel was finished barring further provocation, while Israel and the U.S. promised to retaliate against Tehran's escalation as fears of a wider war intensified.</p>

<p>Washington said it would work with longtime ally Israel to make sure Iran faced "severe consequences" for Tuesday's attack.</p>

<p>The United Nations Security Council scheduled a meeting about the Middle East for Wednesday, and the European Union called for an immediate ceasefire.</p>

<p>"Our action is concluded unless the Israeli regime decides to invite further retaliation. In that scenario, our response will be stronger and more powerful," Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said in a post on X early on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Israel early on Wednesday renewed its bombardment of Beirut's southern suburbs, a Hezbollah stronghold, with at least three strikes against what it said were targets belonging the group.</p>

<p>Large smoke plumes seen rising from parts of the suburbs. Israel issued new evacuation orders for the area, which have largely emptied after days of heavy strikes.</p>

<p>In its biggest ever military blow against Israel, Iran fired more than 180 ballistic missiles on Tuesday, according to Israel. Sirens sounded across the country and explosions rattled Jerusalem and the Jordan River valley as the entire population was told to seek shelter in bomb shelters.</p>

<p>No injuries were reported in Israel, but one man was killed in the occupied West Bank, authorities there said.</p>

<p>Iran described the campaign as defensive and solely aimed at Israeli military facilities. Iran's state news agency said three Israeli military bases had been targeted.</p>

<p>Tehran said its attack was responding to Israeli killings of militant leaders and aggression in Lebanon against the Iran-backed armed movement Hezbollah and in Gaza.</p>

<p>Israel activated air defences against Iran's bombardment and most missiles were intercepted "by Israel and a defensive coalition led by the United States," Israeli Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said in a video on X, adding: "Iran's attack is a severe and dangerous escalation."</p>

<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to hit back. "Iran made a big mistake tonight - and it will pay for it," Netanyahu said at the outset of an emergency political-security cabinet meeting late on Tuesday, according to a statement.</p>

<p>Any Israeli response to Tuesday's missile attack would be met with "vast destruction" of Israeli infrastructure, Iran's General Staff of the Armed Forces said in a statement carried by state media, also promising to target regional assets of any Israeli ally that got involved.</p>

<p>Fears that Iran and the U.S. would be drawn into a regional war have risen with Israel's growing assault on Lebanon in the past two weeks, including the start of a ground operation there on Monday, and its year-old conflict in the Gaza Strip.</p>

<p>Iran's forces on Tuesday used hypersonic Fattah missiles for the first time, and 90% of its missiles successfully hit their targets in Israel, the Revolutionary Guards said.</p>

<p>Israel's Hagari said central and southern Israel received limited strikes. A video released by the military showed a school in the central city of Gadera heavily damaged by an Iranian missile.</p>

<p>U.S. Navy warships fired about a dozen interceptors against Iranian missiles headed toward Israel, the Pentagon said. Britain said its forces played a part "in attempts to prevent further escalation in the Middle East" without elaborating.</p>

<p>U.S. President Joe Biden expressed full U.S. support for Israel and described Iran's attack as "ineffective." Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic candidate for U.S. president, backed Biden's stance and said the U.S. would not hesitate to defend its interests against Iran.</p>

<p>"We will act. Iran will soon feel the consequences of their actions. The response will be painful," Israel's U.N. Ambassador Danny Danon told reporters.</p>

<p><strong>U.S. DOES NOT URGE RESTRAINT</strong></p>

<p>The White House similarly promised "severe consequences" for Iran and spokesman Jake Sullivan told a Washington briefing the U.S. would "work with Israel to make that the case."</p>

<p>Sullivan did not specify what those consequences might be, but he stopped short of urging restraint by Israel as the U.S. did in April when Iran carried out a drone and missile attack on Israel. The Pentagon said Tuesday's airstrikes by Iran were about twice the size of April's assault.</p>

<p>U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemned what he called "escalation after escalation", saying: "This must stop. We absolutely need a ceasefire."</p>

<p>EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell also called for an immediate regional ceasefire. "The dangerous cycle of attacks and retaliation risks ... spiralling out of control," he posted on X.</p>

<p>British Prime Minister Keir Starmer spoke with the leaders of Germany and France, and they agreed on a need for restraint from all sides, Downing Street said.</p>

<p>Nearly 1,900 people have been killed and more than 9,000 wounded in Lebanon in almost a year of cross-border fighting, most in the past two weeks, according to Lebanese government statistics on Tuesday.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Tuesday survived a second vote of no confidence in as many weeks, brought again by his main Tory rival intent on unseating his beleaguered Liberals.</p>

<p>The 207 to 121 vote was largely a repeat of the Conservatives' failed attempt last week to trigger snap elections, which saw two smaller factions in parliament siding with Trudeau's minority government.</p>

<p>The motion accused the government of failing to address a housing crunch, rising crime and costs of living, and of being "the most centralizing government in Canadian history."</p>

<p>With a 20-point lead in public opinion polling, Tory leader Pierre Poilievre has been itching to go to the polls since the leftist New Democratic Party (NDP) last month tore up a coalition agreement with the Liberals, leaving the Trudeau administration vulnerable to being toppled.</p>

<p>But the NDP and other opposition parties, whose support is needed to bring down the Liberals, have pushed back against his right-wing agenda.</p>

<p>Still, Poilievre has vowed to keep trying.</p>

<p>In Canada's Westminster parliamentary system, a ruling party must hold the confidence of the House of Commons, which means maintaining support from a majority of members.</p>

<p>The Liberals currently have 153 seats, versus 119 for the Conservatives, 33 for the Bloc Quebecois, and the NDP's 25.</p>

<p>Trudeau swept to power in 2015, and has managed to hold on through two ballots in 2019 and 2021.</p>

<p>But his popularity has plunged and he has faced a number of setbacks in recent months, including by-election losses in two of his party's strongholds.</p>

<p>The deal with the New Democratic Party to prop up the Liberals would have kept his government in office until late 2025.</p>

<p>But the NDP, seeing its alignment with the Liberals hurting its own popularity, exited the pact early.</p>

<p>Most analysts have told AFP they do not anticipate Canadians going to the polls before spring 2025, but added that the situation is fluid.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the Liberals have been left weakened as they seek to continue governing in a fractured parliament.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Iran's Ambassador to India Iraj Elahi today said that his country will "strike Israel again", if Tel Aviv doesn't refrain from attacking Tehran's national assets and interests in the region.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iran's Ambassador to India Iraj Elahi today said that his country will "strike Israel again", if Tel Aviv doesn't refrain from attacking Tehran's national assets and interests in the region.</p>

<p>Calling the missile attack on Israel a "retaliatory operation", the Ambassador said that "Iran does not joke about its international interests and national security." The Ambassador's remarks come after a sharp escalation in the West Asia conflict when Tehran on Tuesday fired nearly 200 missiles targeting all of Israel.</p>

<p>The nearly year-long conflict between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza strip has intensified with Tel Aviv going after Hezbollah - an Iran-backed militant organisation which supports Hamas. Iran had vowed to avenge the killing of Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah, killed last week, and had warned Israel of an imminent ballistic missile attack against it.</p>

<p>Speaking exclusively to NDTV, Iran's Ambassador said, "If Israel does not stop its hostility and its violations against the Iran's national interests, it will face such strikes again and again."</p>

<p>He went on to say that "People, not only in the region, but across the world are witnessing Israel's hostile moves in West Asia. Everyone is seeing the bloodshed in Gaza and south Lebanon. People are angry. Israel has violated all human rights treaties, all international laws, so, many people all over the world are very angry with what Israel is doing in the region."</p>

<p>The Ambassador further said that he believes Iran's missile attack on Israel will be "supported by many, many people around the world. You have seen how people marched in universities across the world protesting against Israel's brutality against Palestine."</p>

<h2><strong>NETANYAHU'S WARNING AFTER IRAN MISSILE ATTACK</strong></h2>

<p>Meanwhile, Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu called Iran's missile attack on Israel "A failed attempt", as Israel's Iron Dome and other mechanisms to stop such attacks prevented most of the 180-plus missiles from hitting its territories, with only a few missiles penetrating its defence.</p>

<p>Mr Netanyahu also said that "Iran made a big mistake tonight - and it will pay for it."</p>

<p>Speaking about the Israeli Prime Minister, Mr Elahi referred to him as "the new Hitler of this century". Repeating his statement, the Ambassador further said, "If the Hitler of our time stops his brutality and hostility, then his country won't have to face the consequences," adding that "Iran will keep retaliating if Israel continues."</p>

<h3><strong>AMERICA BACKING ISRAEL</strong></h3>

<p>President Joe Biden has come in support of Israel and condemned the "provocative escalation" by Israel, according to a statement by the White House. The US President ordered the US military to help Israel against any further missile attacks. The US reportedly also warned that areas from where missiles will be launched against Israel will be targeted by the US military.</p>

<p>Commenting about US's support to Israel, the Ambassador told NDTV that "I hope the United States realises and reaches the conclusion that if they stop their support to Tel Aviv, Israel cannot carry on its crimes in the region. I hope the US Administration will convince Netanyahu and oblige (guide) him to stop the brutality."</p>

<p>"We have seen what America has done in Afghanistan, in Iraq, in Libya, and many other parts of the world. So, we believe that the US is behind many developments leading to the instability of the region," he added.</p>

<p>"It is up to Israel now - whether they want to keep continuing this escalation or not (end it). If they continue, we will keep retaliating," Mr Elahi further said, suggesting that the ball is now in the court of "the decision makers of Israel".</p>

<h3><strong>INDIA'S ROLE AS 'FRIEND' OF BOTH IRAN AND ISRAEL</strong></h3>

<p>The Iranian Ambassador saiid he has always believed that "India is a very important player in the region. It has good relations with Israel, and as PM Modi has mentioned that this is not the era for war. We in Iran believe that. But if a country violates the sovereignty of another country, what else can that country do?"</p>

<p>He hoped however, that "India, which has close ties with both sides (Iran and Israel), can help convince Israel to stop its brutality in the region."<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures rose by $1.09, or 1.56%, to $70.92 per barrel at 2254 GMT on fears of oil supply disruptions in the Middle East after Iran fired ballistic missiles at Israel.</p>

<p>Brent futures will resume trading at 0000 GMT on Wednesday. Brent gained $1.86, or 2.6%, on Tuesday to settle at $73.56 a barrel.</p>

<p>Iran fired more than 180 ballistic missiles at Israel on Tuesday, Israel said, in retaliation for Israel's campaign against Tehran's Hezbollah allies in Lebanon.</p>

<p>Iran, a member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), is a major oil producer in the region.</p>

<p>"The direct involvement of Iran, an OPEC member, raises the prospect of disruptions to oil supplies," ANZ Research said in a note, referring to the conflict.</p>

<p>Iran's oil output rose to a six-year high of 3.7 million barrels per day in August, ANZ added.</p>

<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu promised Iran would pay for its missile attack against Israel, while Tehran said any retaliation would be met with "vast destruction", raising fears of a wider war.</p>

<p>U.S. President Joe Biden expressed full U.S. support for Israel, its longtime ally, and the U.N. Security Council scheduled a meeting on the Middle East for Wednesday.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential candidate, said on Tuesday that Iran was a "dangerous" and "destabilizing" force in the Middle East and Washington was committed to Israel's security.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential candidate, said on Tuesday that Iran was a "dangerous" and "destabilizing" force in the Middle East and Washington was committed to Israel's security.</p>

<p><strong>WHY IT'S IMPORTANT</strong></p>

<p>The comments from Harris, who faces Republican former President Donald Trump in the Nov. 5 U.S. election, came hours after Iran fired ballistic missiles at Israel in retaliation for Israel's military campaign in Lebanon, drawing vows of a sharp response from Israel and the U.S.</p>

<p>No injuries were reported in Israel and Washington called Iran's attack ineffective.</p>

<p><strong>KEY QUOTES</strong></p>

<p>"I'm clear-eyed Iran is a destabilizing, dangerous force in the Middle East," Harris said. "I will always ensure Israel has the ability to defend itself against Iran and Iran-backed terrorist militias."</p>

<p>"I fully support President (Joe) Biden's order for the U.S. military to shoot down Iranian missiles targeting Israel," Harris said. "Initial indications are that Israel, with our assistance, was able to defeat this attack."</p>

<p>Harris added that Washington will work with its allies to disrupt what she called Iran's "aggressive behavior."</p>

<p><strong>CONTEXT</strong></p>

<p>Israel has escalated its military campaign in Lebanon in recent days, killing hundreds and displacing more than a million due to operations that Israel says are targeting Lebanese Iran-backed Hezbollah militants.</p>

<p>Israel's military campaign in Lebanon is in addition to its war in Gaza that followed a deadly Oct. 7 attack on Israel by Palestinian Hamas militants. Israeli's military assault on Gaza has killed tens of thousands according to Palestinian health authorities, displaced nearly everyone there, caused a hunger crisis and prompted genocide allegations that Israel denies.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel Defense Forces or IDF is currently assessing the missile attack by Iran today and an appropriate response will be given to Tehran, said Guy Nir, spokesperson of the Israeli embassy in India, speaking exclusively to NDTV.</p>

<p>Iran today fired a barrage of missiles at Israel - nearly 200 of them - in its attempt to send a message to Tel Aviv in the aftermath of the killings of the Hamas and Hezbollah chiefs. While Israel was able to block out most of the missiles, there were some that hit regions across the north and south of the country.</p>

<p>This has been the sharpest escalation in tensions in West Asia (Middle East) since the start of the Israel Hamas war in Gaza nearly a year ago. Iran's Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who is currently sheltered in a safe house at an undisclosed location, was the one who reportedly gave the green signal for the missile attack on Israel today.</p>

<p>Speaking to NDTV, The Israel Embassy spokesperson warned that "If he (Ayatollah Ali Khamenei) plans to initiate a full-scale war with Israel, it will be a mistake for them (Iran)." He went on to say that Israel's response to Tuesday's attack will be a strategic, pin-pointed one. "Israel's response is going to be something strategic and pin-pointed, and not a full-scale war. I don't think any side wants that," he said.</p>

<p>The Israeli spokesperson also cautioned any other nation which might consider joining Iran to attack Israel. "If any country is wanting to join Iran, all I can hope is that they don't, because if they do, the outcome will be devastating for them too," he warned.</p>

<p>Speaking about Israel's top-notch defence mechanism, the Israeli spokesperson said that it is not just renowned 'Iron Dome', but other systems too, but did not give more details on what they are. "It is not just the Iron Dome, we have many other defence systems in place that I cannot elaborate on for security reasons, which were helping us to bring this situation under control. The systems are very precise and out of over 180 missiles, most of them were not able to penetrate through these," he said.</p>

<p>The spokesperson further confirmed that at the moment "there are no casualties in Israel, but there is one in Palestinian territories". This he said, was because Iran targeted the entire region. He also explained how every Israeli national is prepared and trained for such scenarios, thereby preventing the loss of lives across the country.</p>

<p><strong>Q) Will it be an all-out war? Or is there a possibility that it will be contained?</strong><br />
A) Right now IDF is saying they are trying to understand, assess and calculate the next steps to take this forward. We have confirmed that 181 missiles have been fired at Israel by Iran. It seems like the attack is complete now and Israeli citizens are out of their bunkers and shelters.</p>

<p><strong>Q) What is the situation in Israel at the moment?</strong><br />
A) Two hours ago, the Israel Defence Force of IDF had asked all citizens to go into shelters and bunkers to prepare for this attack. Around an hour ago we began to see missiles in the air and also falling all across Israel. All together, over 180 missiles were fired on Israel. As of now, the attack is finished and people are out of their shelters.</p>

<p><strong>Q) Video footage shows that these missiles have hit many targets and there might by casualties. Do you have an update on this?</strong><br />
A) So what we are seeing is that missiles have fallen across north and south Israel. These missiles have hit either buildings or in open areas. Up to now, we do not have any Israeli casualties as all Israelis went into their bunkers and safe rooms. However, there is one casualty in Palestinian territories as Iran launched missiles across the region. So currently we have confirmation of this one Palestinian person being killed in the Iran attack.</p>

<p><strong>Q) How efficient has the Iron Dome system been for Israel?</strong><br />
A) It is not just the Iron Dome, we have many other defence systems that I cannot elaborate on for security reasons, which were helping us to bring this situation under control. The systems are very precise and out of over 180 missiles, most of them did not go through.</p>

<p><strong>Q) Do you think Israel will now attack Iran as well and this will turn into an all-out war?</strong><br />
A) So, at the moment I want to be very cautious of what I am going to say. The IDF is currently assessing the situation to see what is going to be the proper way to respond. Will it be an all-out war or will it be something more strategic? Well, I guess Israel's response is going to be something more strategic and pin-pointed and not a full-scale war. I don't think any side wants that.</p>

<p><strong>Q) As per reports, the Supreme leader of Iran, Ayatollah Khameni, is the one who had given the green signal for this missile attack. What is your take on this?</strong><br />
A) I believe that if he plans to initiate a full-scale war with Israel, it will be a mistake for them.</p>

<p><strong>Q) It is believed that many other nations will join Iran in this war. Is Israel prepared for that?</strong><br />
A) Israel is prepared for many scenarios. Israel is not alone. We have a number of our allies who will help us too. As for any country wanting to join Iran, all I can hope is that they don't, because if they do, the outcome will be devastating for them too.</p>

<p><strong>Q) According to you, which countries might join Iran in this offensive against Israel?</strong><br />
A) I hope none.</p>

<p><strong>Q) How is your family in Israel? Hope they are safe after this attack?</strong><br />
A) I have spoken to my family after all this began. All of them are fine. I have a friend who lives very close to one of the areas that was attacked. I called her right away to make sure she was okay. All my family and relatives are fine.</p>

<p><strong>Q) What is the kind of drill that most people in Israel are trained for, for such situations?</strong><br />
A) So, every single person in Israel has a bunker or safe room in their homes - which have a double-sided wall which is unpenetrable for such missile attacks. All Israelis know and are trained that when there are alarms, they must get into their safe rooms within a specific time period given to them - which is usually 60 seconds to 120 seconds, depending on where you live. And we let them know in advance when they need to be close to a safe room as within the next hour or so there might be an alarm. The Israeli people always adhere to this. They are always prepared. They listen to these instructions very carefully. So, even today, when the final call happened, everyone was already close to a safe room, so they could go in fast and close the door.</p>

<p><strong>Q) So, every home or building across Israel has a safe home within it or attached to it?</strong><br />
A) Yes, a majority of the homes in Israel have them. Since 1991 we have a law which requires all buildings, all homes and apartments have a room like this. So, all new buildings and apartments have them. Older buildings usually have safe rooms at the ground level (covered bunkers). So everyone goes down to the ground level and sits there.</p>

<p><strong>Q) After today's attack by Iran, is there any chance of containing this war in the next two or three days, or even the week ahead?</strong><br />
A) I hope so.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iran's ballistic missile assault on Israel was "defeated and ineffective", the White House said on Tuesday, warning that Tehran could expect severe consequences for the attacks.</p>

<p>"Based on what we know at this point, this attack appears to have been defeated and ineffective," Jake Sullivan, US President Joe Biden's national security advisor, told reporters.</p>

<p>Sullivan hailed US efforts to repel some of the attacks, which involved American naval destroyers shooting down some of the missiles.</p>

<p>Iran's attack was however a "significant escalation" of tensions in the Middle East, Sullivan said -- adding that it was an "ongoing situation" that meant he could only answer a few questions before getting back to his desk.</p>

<p>"Obviously, this is a significant escalation by Iran, a significant event, and it is equally significant that we were able to step up with Israel," Sullivan told the briefing.</p>

<p>The White House official would not say what consequences Tehran could expect to face, saying it would discuss "next steps" with Israel.</p>

<p>"We have made clear that there will be consequences, severe consequences, for this attack, and we will work with Israel to make that the case," Sullivan said.</p>

<p>US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said separately that Iran's missile attack was "unacceptable" and that the entire world should condemn it.</p>

<p>"Initial reports suggest that Israel, with the active support of the United States and other partners, effectively defeated this attack," Blinken told reporters.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jimmy Carter celebrated his 100th birthday today - the first ever US president to reach the century mark and another extraordinary milestone for the one-time peanut farmer who found his way to the White House.</p>

<p>Carter's longevity - he began hospice care at his home in Plains, Georgia, more than 19 months ago - has defied all expectations.</p>

<p>No longer regularly appearing in public, the Democratic ex-president is spending his birthday in the home he and his late wife Rosalynn had built in Plains in the 1960s. Celebrations include a lunch with some 20 members of his extended family, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.</p>

<p>President Joe Biden, in a video posted on his official X account, hailed Carter as a "beloved friend" and "one of the most influential statesmen" in US history.</p>

<p>"Your unwavering belief in the power of human goodness continues to be a guiding light for all of us," he said.</p>

<p>The White House lawn was decorated Tuesday with a sign that read "Happy Birthday President Carter."</p>

<p>Britain's King Charles III sent a private message of congratulations expressing "great admiration for the president's lifetime of duty and public service," a Buckingham Palace spokesperson said.</p>

<p>And Georgia Governor Brian Kemp, currently overseeing the response to a major storm disaster, proclaimed "Jimmy Carter Day" across the state.</p>

<h3><strong>LITTLE TOWN</strong></h3>

<p>Beyond serving as commander in chief for a single term from 1977 to 1981, Carter worked as a global mediator, rights activist and elder statesman, founding the well-respected Carter Center in 1982 to pursue his vision of world diplomacy.</p>

<p>His presidency included the 1978 Camp David Accords between Israel and Egypt, the establishment of diplomatic relations with China following a rapprochement initiated by president Richard Nixon, and the return of control of the Panama Canal to Panama.</p>

<p>But his administration hit numerous snags, including the Iran hostage crisis and a renewed oil crisis in 1979-1980, which saw Ronald Reagan sweep into power in a landslide.</p>

<p>"We are thrilled that the president from this little town is going to be the only president to ever live to be 100 years old," Jill Stuckey, superintendent of the National Park Service's Jimmy Carter historical site and longtime family friend, told AFP.</p>

<p>She spoke from Plains High School, where Carter graduated in 1941 and which now serves as the visitor center for the national park that features sites from his early life, including the nearby peanut farm where he grew up.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, the school held a naturalization ceremony for 100 new US citizens, who placed hands over their hearts and recited the pledge of allegiance.</p>

<p>"He did so much for America," said Adriana Vickers, 46, originally from Brazil.</p>

<p>"He's for all nations," Carlene Ford, another newly naturalized citizen, from Jamaica, told AFP. "He's for everybody, he's for the people."</p>

<p>A flyover of four F-18 jets and two vintage planes graced the skies over Plains as part of the town's celebrations.</p>

<h3><strong>'ALWAYS' POLITICAL</strong></h3>

<p>A devout Baptist and self-described "born-again" Christian, Carter is remembered for a moralistic streak, but also his civility, admired even by detractors across the aisle.</p>

<p>According to family, Carter remains keenly interested in politics and was highly motivated to make it to 100 and to vote in the November election for fellow Democrat Kamala Harris.</p>

<p>"He will be voting by mail-in ballot," Stuckey told AFP, adding "he's always been very politically active, and nothing has changed with that respect."</p>

<p>At the naturalization ceremony, attended by the mayor, those in attendance were encouraged to register to vote.</p>

<p>In Plains, like in many rural places with strong evangelical Christian leanings, far more yard signs support Republican Donald Trump than Harris.</p>

<p>But it is also not uncommon to see a sign celebrating Carter's centennial birthday next to one supporting Trump.</p>

<p>Carl Lowell, who has lived in Plains since infancy, said he tries not to get involved in politics because it is "so divisive" right now.</p>

<p>Like most residents of Plains, the 59-year-old retired firefighter is linked to Carter in various ways -- he says his grandfather helped build the Carters' house and that he himself even went dove hunting with him once.</p>

<p>"Jimmy's a good man, he's a godly man, and that's what people like about him," he said.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President Joe Biden has ordered the US military to "aid Israel's defense" and shoot down any and all Iranian missiles targeting Israel, the White House said.</p>

<p>President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee in next month's US presidential election, are both monitoring Iran's attack on Israel from the White House situation room, it said.</p>

<p>"President Biden directed the US military to aid Israel's defense against Iranian attacks and shoot down missiles that are targeting Israel," the White House said in a statement.</p>

<p>A call that Joe Biden had scheduled with rabbis today ahead of the Jewish high holiday season - which begins later this week with Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish new year - had been postponed to another day, a White House official said.</p>

<p>The United States and other western allies also stepped in to help defend Israel against a combined Iranian missile and drone attack in April, which Tehran launched in retaliation for an Israeli strike on the Iranian consulate in Damascus.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iran has attacked Israel with missiles and rockets today after tensions escalated in West Asia following artillery and air strikes on Lebanon to target Hezbollah, a Shia militant outfit and a strong ally of Iran.</p>

<p>Iran's Revolutionary Guards said today's attack is in response to the killing of Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah last week as well as that of the Hamas leader.</p>

<p>Israel's formidable air defence systems were in action to intercept rockets and missiles launched from Iran. Videos show the night sky lighting up with explosions after air raid sirens echoed across the country. The missiles were detected over the Jordanian air space, the flight path followed by the missiles when fired toward Israel. Jordan has announced a suspension of air traffic after the attack on Israel.</p>

Iran fired over 100 missiles, Israeli media reported and several videos showed intercepted missile debris falling over Israeli cities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, President Joe Biden has ordered the US military to "aid Israel's defence" and shoot down Iranian missiles targeting Israel. Both Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris are monitoring Iran's attack on Israel from the White House situation room, it said in a statement.</p>

<p>This is the second Iranian attack on Israel in less than six months. In April, Iran launched a swarm of explosive drones and fired missiles at Israel. The Iranian salvo amounted to more than 200 drones and missiles. Iran has vowed retaliation for what it called an Israeli strike on its Damascus consulate on April 1 that killed seven Guards officers including two senior commanders.</p>

<h3><strong>Israel's Multi-Tier Air Defence System</strong></h3>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/israel-iran-war-explained-how-israel-countered-irans-aerial-attack-with-arrow-missiles-5437654">The Arrow Defence System</a> is a surface-to-surface missile system forming an upper tier in Israel's multi-layered air defence system.</p>

<p>Iron Dome has shot down thousands of rockets since 2011 but is limited to a short range. Israel also has a medium-to-long-range interceptor known as David's Sling.</p>

The Iron Dome system, which has been battle-tested in the past, was actively deployed to intercept drones and short-range threats.</p>

<p>The radar of Arrow 2 - used against long-range ballistic missiles - has an effective range of 2,400 kilometres and can strike altitudes of 100 kilometres.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The radar constantly detects incoming threats towards the territory. Once a target is detected, real-time information is relayed to the control centre regarding the estimated trajectory of the target, its speed, and if the missile is heading toward a strategic target like cities or military establishments, the missile is launched.</p>

<p>The Arrow 3 Air Defence System neutralize targets in the exo-atmosphere before the ballistic missile enters the re-entry stage. In April, when Iran launched an unprecedented attack on Israel with ballistic and cruise missiles, the Arrow 3 system intercepted the missiles before the re-entry stage in the atmosphere.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The United States has funded roughly half of the annual development costs of the Arrow 2 system. By 2020, the total U.S. financial contribution toward the Arrow Weapon System exceeded $3.7 billion.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iran's Revolutionary Guards threatened to carry out "crushing attacks" against regional foe Israel if it retaliated for a missile attack under way on Tuesday.</p>

<p>"If the Zionist regime reacts to Iranian operations, it will face crushing attacks," the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps said in a statement carried by the Fars news agency.</p>

<p>On Tuesday evening, Iran launched a missile attack targeting Israel's commercial hub Tel Aviv, state media reported.</p>

<p>The United States had spoken of an imminent Iranian ballistic missile attack against Israel and warned it would have "severe" consequences for Tehran.</p>

<p>Iranian media carried online footage of what they said were missiles being launched against Israel.</p>

<p>State television played joyful songs over the footage and its anchor congratulated "the brave Iranian people".</p>

<p>Tuesday's attack was Iran's second on Israel after a a missile and drone attack in April in retaliation for a deadly Israeli air strike on the Iranian consulate in Damascus.</p>

<p>Nearly all the munitions fired in that attack were intercepted by Israel or its allies.</p>

<p>An Israeli strike on Beirut on Friday killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, whose Lebanese militant group has been armed and financed by the Islamic republic for years.</p>

<p>Nasrallah was killed alongside General Abbas Nilforoushan, a top commander of the Quds Force, the Guards' foreign operations arm.</p>

<p>Iran vowed Nilforoushan's killing "will not go unanswered".</p>

<p>At the UN General Assembly in New York last month, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian accused Israel of warmongering while Iran had exercised restraint.</p>

<p>He suggested Iran had held back retaliation for the killing of Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran in July, fearing it could derail US-backed efforts for a Gaza ceasefire.</p>

<p>"We tried to not respond. They kept telling us we were within reach of peace, perhaps in a week or so," he said.</p>

<p>On Sunday, Pezeshkian said promises by the US and its allies of a "ceasefire in exchange for Iran's non-reaction to Haniyeh's killing were completely false".</p>

<p>He added that "giving these criminals (Israel) a chance would only encourage them to commit more crimes."</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Amid escalating tensions in West Asia (Middle East), the Indian Embassy in Israel has cautioned all Indians to stay vigilant and follow safety protocols advised by local authorities. The advisory was issued within hours of Iran threatening an attack on Israel in the aftermath of Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah being killed in an Israeli missile attack.</p>

<p>Iran followed up on the threat by launching over 180 missiles at Israel, Iran's state media confirmed. Israel's defence forces said that its nationals were already in bunkers, taking shelter from the attack.</p>

<p>The nearly year-long conflict between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza strip has intensified with Tel Aviv going after Hezbollah - an Iran-backed militant organisation which supports Hamas. Iran had vowed to avenge the killing of Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah, killed last week, and had warned Israel of an imminent ballistic missile attack against it.</p>

<p>"In view of the prevailing situation in the region, all Indian nationals in Israel are advised to stay vigilant and adhere to safety protocols as advised by the local authorities," The Indian Embassy in Tel Aviv said in its advisory.</p>

<p>"Please exercise caution, avoid unnecessary travel within the country and stay close to safety shelters," it added.</p>

<p>The Embassy also shared round-the-clock helpline numbers where Indian nationals can call in case of emergency. "The Embassy is closely monitoring the situation and remains in regular touch with Israeli authorities to ensure the safety of all our nationals," it said, adding, "In case of any emergency, please contact the 24x7 helpline of the Embassy - +972-547520711 and +972-543278392."</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iran launched missiles at Israel on Tuesday as alarms sounded across the country and civilians rushed for shelter. Iran said the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/rockets-fired-from-iran-on-israel-civilians-hiding-in-bomb-shelters-says-israel-defence-forces-6694961">attack on Israel </a>was a response to the killings of Guards commander and other leaders.</p>

<p>The Israel's military later sounded the all-clear and said Israelis were free to leave their shelters. It vowed retaliation against Iran "at place and time we decide".</p>

<p>The Iran Guards, meanwhile, threatened 'crushing attacks' if Israel responded to the missile attack.</p>

<p>Earlier, the Israel military had announced that any ballistic missile strike from Iran was expected to be widespread and told the public to shelter in safe rooms in the event of an attack.</p>

<p>The firing of missiles came after Israeli troops launched ground raids into Lebanon, in the biggest escalation of regional warfare since fighting erupted in Gaza a year ago.<br />

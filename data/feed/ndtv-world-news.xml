       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Heavy battles and bombardment hit Gaza City's Shujaiya district for a fourth day on Sunday, months after the Israeli army declared Hamas's command structure dismantled in the northern area.</p>

<p>Tens of thousands of Palestinians have fled the devastated neighbourhood, where the army said it has fought Hamas and Islamic Jihad operatives both "above and below ground" in tunnels.</p>

<p>The military said troops had "eliminated several terrorists, located weapons and conducted targeted raids on booby-trapped combat compounds" over the past 24 hours while the air force had "struck dozens" of the operatives' infrastructure sites.</p>

<p>It also reported clashes in central Gaza and the southern Rafah area, a week after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared that the "intense phase" of the war raging since October 7 was nearing an end.</p>

<p>The United Nations humanitarian agency OCHA estimated that "60,000 to 80,000 people were displaced" from Shujaiya since new fighting broke out there on Thursday and the army issued evacuation orders.</p>

<p>Months of on-and-off talks towards a Gaza truce and hostage release deal have meanwhile made little progress, with Hamas saying Saturday there was "nothing new" in a revised plan presented by US mediators.</p>

<p>United States President Joe Biden late last month outlined what he called an Israeli plan for a six-week truce and exchange of some hostages for Palestinian prisoners held in Israel.</p>

<p>Washington last week presented "new language" for parts of the proposed deal, according to US news site Axios.</p>

<p>A Hamas official in Lebanon, Osama Hamdan, confirmed that the Islamist movement had received the latest proposal but said it presented "no real progress in the negotiations to stop the aggression".</p>

<p>Hamdan labelled the proposals "a waste of time" that aimed to give "additional time for the occupation (Israel) to practise genocide".</p>

<h3><strong>'Everything is rubble'</strong></h3>

<p>The war started with Hamas's October 7 attack on southern Israel which resulted in the deaths of 1,195 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.</p>

<p>The Hamas also seized 251 hostages, 116 of whom remain in Gaza although the army says 42 are dead.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 37,877 people, also mostly civilians, according to data from the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza.</p>

<p>Six more people were killed in an air strike at dawn targeting a family house in Rafah, said medics at Nasser Hospital where the bodies were taken.</p>

<p>Artillery shelling also struck southern areas of Rafah city, witnesses said.</p>

<p>United Nations and other relief agencies have voiced alarm over the dire humanitarian crisis and threat of starvation the war and Israeli siege have brought for Gaza's 2.4 million people.</p>

<p>"It's really unbearable," said Louise Wateridge from UNRWA, the UN agency supporting Palestinian refugees, speaking Friday after returning to the city of Khan Yunis.</p>

<p>"Everything is rubble," she said. "And yet people are living there again... There's no water there, there's no sanitation, there's no food. And now, people are living back in these buildings that are empty shells."</p>

<p>In Israel, thousands of protesters again took to the streets of Tel Aviv on Saturday night, demanding greater efforts to return the remaining captives, and calling for early elections.</p>

<p>Former hostage Noa Argamani, 26, who was rescued in a special forces raid on June 8, said in a video address that "we can't forget about the hostages who are still in Hamas captivity, and we must do everything possible to bring them back home".</p>

<h3><strong>'An obliterating war'</strong></h3>

<p>The Gaza conflict has also led to soaring tensions on Israel's northern border with Lebanon, where the army has traded cross-border fire with the Hezbollah movement since October.</p>

<p>Hezbollah is part of the "axis of resistance" of Iran-backed armed groups against Israel and its Western allies. The grouping also includes&nbsp;operatives in Iraq and Yemen's Huthi rebels.</p>

<p>Israel's military said this month that its plans for a Lebanon offensive had been "approved and validated", prompting Hezbollah to respond that no part of Israel would be spared in a full-blown conflict.</p>

<p>Iran's mission to the UN, on social media Saturday, said it "deems as psychological warfare the Zionist regime's propaganda about intending to attack Lebanon".</p>

<p>It also warned its arch foe that, "should it embark on full-scale military aggression, an obliterating war will ensue".&nbsp;</p>

<p>"All options, incl. the full involvement of all Resistance Fronts, are on the table."</p>

<p>Iran, which backs Hamas, has praised the October 7 attack as a success but has denied any involvement.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US rapper Kanye West was in Moscow, Russian media reported on Sunday quoting a well-known Russian producer.</p>

<p>Western artists have mostly not performed in Russia during its Ukraine offensive, which led to massive US and European sanctions on Moscow, as well as travel restrictions to the country.</p>

<p>Kanye West, who has stirred controversy with his political statements in the United States and was recently accused of praising Adolf Hitler, has expressed admiration for President Vladimir Putin in the past.</p>

<p>"Kanye West is already in Moscow! This is great news, he is staying in the heart of the capital," the state TASS news agency quoted producer Yana Rudkovskaya as saying on social media.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Her announcement followed rumours last month that West will perform a concert in Moscow.</p>

<p>But Luzhniki Stadium, where he was rumoured to perform, told state media it does not have information on possible concerts by the famous rapper.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ferocious storms and torrential rains that lashed France, Switzerland and Italy this weekend have left five people dead, local authorities said on Sunday.</p>

<p>Three people in their 70s and 80s died in France's northeastern Aube region on Saturday when a tree crushed the car they were travelling in during fierce winds, the local authority told AFP.</p>

<p>A fourth passenger was in critical care, it added.</p>

<p>In neighbouring Switzerland, two people have died and a third is missing after torrential rains triggered a landslide in the southeast, police in the Italian-speaking canton of Ticino said.</p>

<p>According to local daily La Regione, the dead were two women who were on holiday in the Alpine region.</p>

<p>Emergency services were assessing the best way to evacuate 300 people who had arrived for a football tournament in Peccia, while almost 70 more were being evacuated from a holiday camp in the village of Mogno.</p>

<p>The poor weather was making rescue work particularly difficult, police had said earlier, with several valleys inaccessible and cut off from the electricity network.</p>

<p>The federal alert system also said part of the canton was without drinking water.</p>

<p>In the western canton of Valais, the civil security services said "several hundred" people were evacuated and roads closed after the Rhone and its tributaries overflowed in different locations.</p>

<p>Extreme rainfall also struck southeastern Switzerland last weekend, leaving one dead and causing major damage.</p>

<p>In northern Italy's Aosta Valley, internet users shared images of spectacular floods and swollen rivers rushing down mountain slopes.</p>

<p>Scientists say climate change driven by human activity is increasing the severity, frequency and length of extreme weather events such as floods and storms.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[French voters began voting on Sunday in the first round of a snap parliamentary election that could usher in the country's first far-right government since World War Two, a potential sea change at the heart of the European Union.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>French voters began voting on Sunday in the first round of a snap parliamentary election that could usher in the country's first far-right government since World War Two, a potential sea change at the heart of the European Union.</p>

<p>President Emmanuel Macron stunned the country when he called the vote after his centrist alliance was crushed in European elections this month by Marine Le Pen's National Rally (RN). Her eurosceptic, anti-immigrant party was a longtime pariah but is now closer to power than it has ever been.</p>

<p>Polls opened at 0600 GMT and will close at 1600 GMT in small towns and cities, with an 1800 GMT finish in the bigger cities, when the first exit polls for the night and seat projections for the decisive second round a week later are expected.</p>

<p>However the electoral system can make it hard to estimate the precise distribution of seats in the 577-seat National Assembly, and the final outcome will not be known until the end of voting on July 7.</p>

<p>"We are going to win an absolute majority," said Le Pen in a newspaper interview on Wednesday, predicting that her protégé, 28-year-old Jordan Bardella would be prime minister. Her party has a high-spending economic programme and seeks to reduce immigration.</p>

<p>If the RN does win an absolute majority, French diplomacy could be headed for an unprecedented period of turbulence: with Macron - who has said he will continue his presidency until the end of his term in 2027 - and Bardella jostling for the right to speak for France.</p>

<p>At a voting station in Sevres, on the outskirts of Paris, 70-year-old former company director Didier Delacroix said he had voted for Macron's alliance.</p>

<p>"Otherwise it'll be a complete mess," he said.</p>

<p>France has had three periods of "cohabitation" - when the president and government are from opposite political camps - in its post-war history, but none with such radically divergent world views competing at the top of the state.</p>

<p>Bardella has already indicated he would challenge Macron on global issues. France could lurch from being a pillar of the EU to a thorn in its side, demanding a rebate of the French contribution to the EU budget, clashing with Brussels over European Commission jobs and reversing Macron's calls for greater EU unity and assertiveness on defence.</p>

<p>A clear RN victory would also bring uncertainty as to where France stands on the Russia-Ukraine war. Le Pen has a history of pro-Russian sentiment and while the party now says it would help Ukraine defend itself against Russian invaders, it has also set out red lines, such as refusing to provide long-range missiles.</p>

<h3><strong>'Split Voters Favour RN'</strong></h3>

<p>Opinion polls have suggested the RN has a comfortable lead of 33-36% of the popular vote, with a hastily assembled left-wing coalition, the New Popular Front, in second place on 28-31% and Macron's centrist alliance in third on 20-23%.</p>

<p>The New Popular Front includes a wide range of parties, from the moderate centre-left to the hard-left, eurosceptic, anti-NATO party France Unbowed, led by one of Macron's most vitriolic opponents, Jean-Luc Melenchon.</p>

<p>How the poll numbers will translate into seats in the National Assembly is hard to predict because of how the election works, said Vincent Martigny, professor of political science at the University of Nice and the Ecole Polytechnique.</p>

<p>Candidates can be elected in the first round if they win an absolute majority of votes in their constituency, but that is rare. Most constituencies will need a second round involving all candidates who received votes from at least 12.5% of registered voters in the first round. The top scorer wins.</p>

<p>"If you have a very high level of participation you might have a third or fourth party that is getting into the struggle. So then of course there's a risk of split voting and we know that the split vote favours the National Rally," said Martigny.</p>

<p>For decades, as the far right steadily gained popularity, voters and parties who did not support it would unite against it whenever it edged closer to national power, but that may not hold true this time.</p>

<p>Martigny said no one knew whether candidates from Macron's camp would consider dropping out of the second round to give rivals from the left a chance of beating the RN, or the reverse.</p>

<p>Le Pen and Bardella have sought to make their party's image more acceptable to the mainstream, for example by denouncing antisemitism. Le Pen's father Jean-Marie Le Pen, founder and long-term leader of the RN's forerunner, had a history of overtly antisemitic comments.</p>

<p>But critics say the RN's courting of Jews is just a cover allowing it to deny accusations of racism while constantly stigmatising Muslims and foreigners.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley claimed that US President Joe Biden will be replaced by a "younger" and more "vibrant" candidate.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Speaking to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/elections/haley-warns-trump-to-prepare-for-younger-rival-renews-call-for-cognitive-tests-5c6d7294">The Wall Street Journal</a>, Ms Haley said, "They are going to be smart about it: they're going to bring somebody younger, they're going to bring somebody vibrant, they're going to bring somebody tested."</p>

<p dir="ltr">She also added that the Grand Old Party and its US Presidential candidate Donald Trump shouldn't consider Mr Biden's replacement an advantage.</p>

<p dir="ltr">“This is a time for Republicans to prepare and get ready for what's to come because there is no way there will be a surviving Democratic Party if they allow Joe Biden to continue to be the candidate,” Nikki Haley, who finished second after Donald Trump in this year's GOP nomination race, said.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Ms Haley's statement comes after Mr Biden's poor showing in the first presidential debate against Trump on June 27.</p>

<p dir="ltr">“Mark my words….Biden will not be the Democratic nominee. Republicans, get your guard up!” she posted on X.</p>

"The odds are north of 80% that the Democratic Party will remove Joe Biden from the ticket and replace him with Michelle Obama because Biden did so disastrously badly tonight that Democrats across the country are in utter freefall and complete panic," he claimed.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, former President Barack Obama extended his support to Biden. On Saturday, he wrote on X, "Bad debate nights happen. Trust me, I know. But this election is still a choice between someone who has fought for ordinary folks his entire life and someone who only cares about himself. Between someone who tells the truth; who knows right from wrong and will give it to the American people straight - and someone who lies through his teeth for his own benefit. Last night didn't change that, and it's why so much is at stake in November."</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Minutes before going on stage for the first presidential debate on Thursday, Donald Trump received a phone call from the mother of 12-year-old Jocelyn Nungaray, who was killed in Houston this month, allegedly by two Venezuelan men in the U.S. illegally.</p>

<p>The mother, Alexis Nungaray, was returning a voicemail Trump had left earlier in the day when she was at her daughter's funeral, a friend of the family, Victoria Galvan, who witnessed the call, told Reuters. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>Nungaray's body was found in a creek near her home on June 17, after her attackers allegedly took her under a bridge, tied her up, took her pants off and strangled her, according to police and prosecutors.</p>

<p>The suspects - Johan Jose Martinez Rangel, 22, and Franklin Jose Pena Ramos, 26 - had been detained by US border authorities in Texas earlier this year but released pending a court appearance.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>During the debate, Trump spoke of Nungaray's case and the phone call as he hammered Biden on his immigration policies, accusing the Democrat of allowing murderers and rapists into the country.</p>

<p>"There have been many young women murdered by the same people he allows to come across our border," Trump said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"These killers are coming into our country and they are raping and killing women. And it's a terrible thing."</p>

<p>Citing Nungaray's case, he said: "This is horrible, what's taken place ... We're literally an uncivilized country now."</p>

<p>Trump's attacks are from a well-thumbed playbook he has used repeatedly since first running for office in 2015 to cast immigrants illegally crossing the southern border as violent criminals.</p>

<p>He typically focuses on young, usually white, women allegedly killed by Hispanic assailants to drive home that message, eschewing cases that involve male victims.</p>

<p>His opponents accuse him of cynically exploiting grieving families to fuel his narrative that foreign-born, often Hispanic, arrivals are part of an invading army.</p>

<p>"Part of what is going on here is an effort to stimulate xenophobia or animus or ethnic hostility," said Christopher Federico, a professor of political science and psychology at the University of Minnesota, adding Trump seems to be playing to racist stereotypes that paint Latino men as threats to "the perceived purity of white womanhood."</p>

<p>Studies generally find there is no evidence immigrants commit crimes at a higher rate than native-born Americans and critics say Trump's rhetoric reinforces racist tropes.</p>

<p>Still, polling shows that the visceral message resonates among many voters. It is amplified by conservative media, pro-Trump influencers online and sometimes the grieving relatives and friends of women killed.</p>

<p>Galvan, 27, blamed Nungaray's death on Biden's easing of some restrictions on the U.S.-Mexico border.</p>

<p>"I think Jocelyn would definitely still be here if President Trump was our president," Galvan said, adding that she planned to vote for the first time in a presidential election and would support Trump.</p>

<p>Despite the lack of evidence, about three-quarters of Republicans in a Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted in May said migrants in the U.S. illegally "are a danger to public safety."</p>

<p>Well-Worn Playbook</p>

<p>Trump has attacked Biden for record levels of migrants caught illegally crossing the U.S.-Mexico border. Immigration is a major voter concern, particularly among conservatives.</p>

<p>In response, Biden blames Trump for urging Republicans to block a bipartisan U.S. Senate bill earlier this year that aimed to toughen border security and has portrayed Trump's policies as unnecessarily cruel.</p>

<p>"Donald Trump is using the pain and loss of American families for the benefit of one person and one person only: Donald Trump," Biden campaign spokesperson Kevin Munoz said in a statement. "His sick and dehumanizing comments do nothing to make our border more secure and are beneath the office of president of the United States."</p>

<p>A digital ad featuring violent crimes and criticizing Biden launched last week in seven battleground states as part of a push by the conservative group Building America's Future.</p>

<p>The ad focuses on Rachel Morin - a mother of five raped and killed while jogging in August 2023 near her Maryland home - and her accused killer, an immigrant from El Salvador in the U.S. illegally.</p>

<p>"Joe Biden's open border, a nightmare for American women," a woman's voice says as the face of Morin's accused killer is displayed next to Biden's.</p>

<p>Trump's approach echoes the oft-cited "Willie Horton" ad attacking Democratic candidate Michael Dukakis in the 1988 presidential campaign, according to Susan Del Percio, a Republican strategist critical of Trump's immigration rhetoric.</p>

<p>Horton was Black and critics said the ad - which effectively boosted Republican George H.W. Bush's candidacy - sought to provoke race-based fear.</p>

<p>"Trump is saying, 'We don't like immigrants and now here's another horrific reason not to like them. They will come after you and kill you,'" she said.</p>

<p>Trump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said Biden's border policies had allowed dangerous criminals to enter the U.S. and that Trump sought to support the families of victims.</p>

<p>"President Trump says their names, calls their mothers, and stands with their families, while Joe Biden continues to ignore their suffering and welcome in millions of dangerous criminal illegal immigrants," Leavitt said in a statement.</p>

<p>Trump has used inflammatory language to describe immigrants in the U.S. illegally, including that they are "poisoning the blood" of the country.</p>

<p>Mixed Reception</p>

<p>The parents of some victims have welcomed Trump's efforts to publicize the brutal killings while others say he is simply politicizing the deaths of their loved ones.</p>

<p>In 2018, Trump publicized the case of Mollie Tibbetts after the 20-year-old University of Iowa student was killed by a Mexican immigrant in the U.S. illegally, but Tibbetts' father chastised Trump at the time for exploiting the tragedy for political gain.</p>

<p>Laura Calderwood, Tibbetts' mother, told Reuters she believed her daughter's murderer was a troubled person but that the killing had nothing to do with his immigration status.</p>

<p>"It was an anomaly," said Calderwood, a Democrat who plans to vote for Biden. "There are lots of illegal immigrants here and they don't go out and murder people."</p>

<p>Michelle Root, whose daughter Sarah was killed in Nebraska in 2016 when her car was hit by a drunken driver in the U.S. illegally, told Reuters that then President Barack Obama and Vice President Biden never responded when she wrote them at the time to raise awareness about the case.</p>

<p>Obama's personal office and the White House did not respond to requests for comment.</p>

<p>Trump, then a presidential candidate, invited her to meet with him before a rally in Omaha, she said. The meeting convinced Root - a lifelong Democrat who twice voted for Obama - to back Trump.</p>

<p>He later called her and asked her permission to mention Sarah's case in his acceptance of the Republican presidential nomination that summer, she said.</p>

<p>"If it wasn't for him, Sarah wouldn't have had a voice," she said.</p>

<p>Patty Morin, the mother of Rachel Morin, was "incredibly touched" when Trump reached out to her earlier this month to offer condolences, her attorney, Randolph Rice, told Reuters.</p>

<p>"During the 20-minute phone call, the president asked about Rachel and her family and how they are doing," Rice said in an email. "She has still not heard from the Biden administration."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On the final weekend of campaigning ahead of the UK general election on Thursday, both Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and the man who is fighting for his job at 10 Downing Street - Labour Leader Keir Starmer, have hit the temple trail to woo British Hindu voters.</p>

<p>While 44-year-old Mr Sunak was at the BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir in Neasden on Sunday to promise to keep trying to "make the community proud", 61-year-old Mr Starmer chose another north London Swaminarayan Temple in Kingsbury on Friday to reiterate his commitment to building a "strategic partnership with India".</p>

<p>The move follows a 'Hindu Manifesto' being launched by an umbrella group of British Hindu organisations for the first time ahead of a British general election, calling on elected representatives to take proactive steps to protect Hindu places of worship and tackle anti-Hindu hate.</p>

<p>"This mandir stands as a great statement of the contributions that this community makes to Britain," said Mr Sunak, in his speech at the iconic Neasden Temple, where he offered prayers and sought blessings from the elderly in the gathering.</p>

<p>"Education, hard work, family, those are my values. Those are your values. Those are Conservative values," he declared in his election pitch.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Mr Starmer was welcomed to the tunes of an India-Scottish pipe band at the Kingsbury Temple, where he also began his speech in the same way as Mr Sunak with "Jai Swaminarayan".</p>

<p>"If we're elected next week, we will strive to govern in the spirit of sewa to serve you and a world in need," said the Labour Leader, reiterating a previous message that there is "absolutely no place for Hinduphobia in Britain".</p>

<p>According to the 2021 census, around 1 million people living in Britain identify as Hindus, making this electorate quite a sizable chunk in the July 4 general election.</p>

<p>"The 'Hindu Manifesto' is a call to action for all parliamentary candidates and political parties to engage with and support the Hindu community in their constituencies," says the Hindus for Democracy group behind the initiative.</p>

<p>"It highlights the contributions of Hindus to the UK's social, cultural and economic fabric and seeks to build a future where these contributions are recognised, valued, protected and promoted for a better future for all," the group said.</p>

<p>While the incumbent Rishi Sunak-led Tories have been trailing in all pre-election surveys, how the diaspora votes line up this time with Britain's first Indian heritage Prime Minister in the race remains to be seen.</p>

<p>"For the Conservative Party, obviously, they have Rishi Sunak - a British Indian leader - for the first time. It's an unknown factor how much it will matter to British Indian voters that the leader of the party is from their background," notes Sunder Katwala, Director of the British Future think tank.</p>

<p>With just days to go before polling day on Thursday, both leaders are expected to undertake a so-called campaign blitz - zig-zagging different parts of the United Kingdom including other places of worship to clinch any remaining undecided votes.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One person was killed and five others wounded in northeastern France when several masked gunmen opened fire at a wedding ceremony, police sources said on Sunday.</p>

<p>Sources suggested that the attack in the northeastern city of Thionville was linked to a settling of scores between drug traffickers.</p>

<p>The shooting took place at a reception hall overnight Saturday to Sunday, with around a hundred people in attendance.</p>

<p>Two people were seriously injured and one of them was in a critical condition.</p>

<p>The perpetrators of the shooting have fled the scene.</p>

<p>"It was during a wedding," a police source said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"At a quarter past one in the morning, a group of people went outside to smoke in front of the hall, and then three heavily armed men arrived and opened fire in their direction."</p>

<p>The assailants arrived in a 4X4 vehicle, "probably a BMW", the source said.</p>

<p>It was not immediately clear where the vehicle had come from. Thionville is located close to the borders of Luxembourg and Germany.</p>

<p>Members of law enforcement believe that a settling of scores linked to drug trafficking was behind the violence.</p>

<p>"The wedding was not targeted as such, it was people who were at the wedding," the source said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A glass door pierced with bullet holes could be seen at the scene on Sunday morning.</p>

<p>In the neighbouring town of Villerupt shootings between rival gangs at a drug dealing point left five people injured in May 2023.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">US President Joe Biden's first presidential debate of the US Election against Republican nominee &nbsp;Donald Trump made all the wrong noises. Mr Biden's shaky performance has been a topic of discussion. While a section has been criticising Joe Biden's performance against Donald Trump, others are wondering what would happen if Mr Biden decided to step down as party flag bearer at the last minute.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Now, let's break it down for you.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">If Joe Biden withdraws his name, delegates from 50 states will have to look for a replacement at the earliest. They will most likely assemble for a nominating convention and officially appoint a candidate. The candidate is picked based on voting.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Who are the potential candidates?</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">Vice President Kamala Harris, California Governor Gavin Newsom, Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer and Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro are among the names that can represent the party.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, US Senator Ted Cruz (R-Texas) has predicted that former First Lady Michelle Obama will replace Joe Biden.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Speaking on his podcast Mr Cruz <a href="http://https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/michelle-obama-to-replace-joe-biden-us-senators-bold-prediction-5994892">said</a>, “The odds are north of 80% that the Democratic Party will remove Joe Biden from the ticket and replace him with Michelle Obama because Biden did so disastrously badly tonight that Democrats across the country are in utter freefall and complete panic.”</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Has this happened before?</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">In 1968, <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/can-joe-biden-be-replaced-as-democratic-presidential-nominee-the-best-way-is-5995140">President Lyndon Johnson</a> sent shockwaves when he decided to exit. He made the announcement in the middle of the Vietnam War.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>What is Joe Biden saying</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">President Joe Biden has<a href="http://https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/i-know-i-am-not-young-man-but-joe-biden-after-poor-debate-showing-5994162"> expressed his intent </a>to defeat&nbsp;Donald Trump in the upcoming November elections.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Speaking at a rally, he said, "I know I'm not a young man, to state the obvious. I don't walk as easy as I used to, I don't speak as smoothly as I used to, I don't debate as well as I used to. I would not be running again if I didn't believe with all my heart and soul that I could do this job. The stakes are too high." The statement came a day after President Biden faced-off with Donal Trump in a heated debate.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A speech being delivered by Nigel Farage, the leader of Britain's right-wing Reform UK party, was interrupted late Saturday when a banner of Russian President Vladimir Putin descended from the ceiling at an election rally.</p>

<p>Campaign group Led by Donkeys, which opposes Farage's views, said it was responsible for the stunt at the Columbine Centre, at Walton on the Naze in southeast England, and posted a video of the unveiling on X.</p>

<p>That showed the banner slowly unfurling behind a speaking Farage, revealing a smiling Putin giving a thumbs-up sign, along with the words "I (heart emoji) Nigel".</p>

<p>Led By Donkeys said on X: "Nigel Farage says Putin is the world leader he 'admires the most' and blames the West for Russia's illegal invasion of Ukraine."</p>

<p>That was a reference to comments Farage made earlier this month when he said the eastward expansion of the European Union and NATO had provoked Putin's invasion of Ukraine.</p>

<p>The remarks, made in an interview with the BBC, drew strong criticism across the British political spectrum ahead of a July 4 national election in which Farage's party is predicted to win millions of votes.</p>

<p>On seeing the banner, Farage said: "Who put that up there," adding: "Someone at the Columbine Centre needs to get the sack."</p>

<p>The audience then started chanting: "Rip it down."</p>

<p>Reuters has sought comment from Reform UK.</p>

<p>Farage is seeking election as a lawmaker, or member of parliament (MP), in Clacton-on-Sea, which is nine miles from Walton on the Naze.</p>

<p>On Friday, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said he was hurt and angry that a supporter of Reform UK had been recorded making a racial slur about him, saying it was too important for him not to speak out.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[France holds the first round of parliamentary elections on Sunday. Opinion polls show the far right could win the two-round legislative vote that concludes on July 7.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>France holds the first round of parliamentary elections on Sunday. Opinion polls show the far right could win the two-round legislative vote that concludes on July 7.</p>

<p>Here are some key facts about the election and what comes next.</p>

<h3><strong>HOW DOES THE VOTE WORK?</strong></h3>

<p>France has 49 million registered voters. There are 577 constituency contests, one for each seat in the National Assembly, the lower house of parliament.</p>

<p>Candidates with an absolute majority of votes in their constituency are elected in the first round. In most cases no candidate meets this criteria and a second round is held.</p>

<p>To qualify for the run-off, candidates need first-round votes amounting to at least 12.5% of registered voters.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The top scorer wins the second round.</p>

<h3><strong>WHEN WILL THE RESULTS BE ANNOUNCED?</strong></h3>

<p>Voting in the first round ends at 8 p.m. (1800 GMT) on Sunday, when pollsters publish nationwide projections based on a partial vote count. These are usually reliable. Official results start trickling in from 8 p.m. Vote counting is usually fast and efficient, and the winners of all, or nearly all, seats will be known by the end of the evening. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>WHO WILL RUN THE GOVERNMENT? &nbsp; &nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>The president names the prime minister, usually from the party with most seats.</p>

<p>For the first time in France's post-war history, the far right could win, opinion polls show, with a left-wing union seen winning the second-biggest group and President Emmanuel Macron's centrist alliance coming third.</p>

<p>But this is an election like no other in France, campaign time is short, the electoral landscape is shaken, and other scenarios cannot be excluded. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>These include a paralysed assembly divided into three groups with no one dominating it or an alliance of mainstream parties to keep the far right out of power. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>An absolute majority requires at least 289 seats.</p>

<p>Marine Le Pen's National Rally (RN) could run a minority government if it wins the most seats without reaching that threshold, but 28-year-old party leader Jordan Bardella said it wanted an absolute majority or would not be able to carry out reforms.</p>

<h3><strong>WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?</strong></h3>

<p>France has had three periods of "cohabitation," where the government is of a different political stripe from the president, in its post-war history.</p>

<p>The government has most of the power on the domestic front, but the president is the head of the military and wields influence abroad. However, the division of power on foreign policy is not clear cut and that could be an issue for France's stance on the war in Ukraine or European Union policy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Macron will have to deal with the new parliament for at least a year, after which he can call another snap election.</p>

<p>Macron won a second mandate in April 2022 and is president for three more years. Neither parliament nor the government can force him out before that. &nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>North Korean officials wore pins with a portrait of Kim Jong Un in public for the first time in pictures released by state media on Sunday, the latest step in the development of a cult of personality about the leader.</p>

<p>The officials, speaking at a key meeting chaired by Kim of the reclusive state's ruling party, wore the typical party logo pin on the right lapel and, on the left chest, the pin with Kim's face against a flag-shaped red background.</p>

<p>The 10th Plenary Meeting of the 8th Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea, which reviews the party's performance for the first half of the year, began on Friday, state news agency KCNA said.</p>

<p>The Kim dynasty that has ruled North Korea since its founding after World War Two has sought to strengthen its grip on power by building cults of personality around itself.</p>

<p>In an apparent push to solidify Kim Jong Un's status as a leader equal to his father and grandfather, North Korean media published photographs showing leader his portrait hanging prominently next to those of Kim Jong Il and national patriarch Kim Il Sung earlier this year.</p>

<p>In April, the music video for a propaganda song praising Kim Jong Un as a "friendly father" and a "great leader" was aired on the state-controlled Korean Central Television, which has been banned by South Korea.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak expressed his anger following a racist slur directed at him by a supporter of Nigel Farage's right-wing Reform UK party. The incident was brought to light by a news channel, which aired a recording of a campaigner using the derogatory term "Paki," a racial slur aimed at people of South Asian descent, in front of his daughters Krishna and Anoushka.</p>

<p>Sunak, Britain's first ethnic minority prime minister, addressing the media on his election campaign trail, said, "It hurts, and it makes me angry. I don't repeat those words lightly. I do so deliberately because this is too important not to call out clearly for what it is."</p>

<p>"When you see Reform candidates and campaigners, seemingly using racist and misogynistic language and opinions seemingly without challenge, I think it tells you something about the culture within the Reform Party," the 44-year-old added.</p>

<p>Farage, leader of the Reform UK party, condemned the remarks as "appalling" and distanced himself from the campaigner Andrew Parker's comments. Farage, running for Parliament, noted that a few individuals had "let us down" and that such sentiments did not reflect the views of the party or its supporters.</p>

<p>"The appalling sentiments expressed by some in these exchanges bear no relation to my own views, those of the vast majority of our supporters or Reform UK," Farage said in a statement.</p>

<p>Reform UK, campaigning on an anti-immigration platform, has faced challenges vetting candidates due to the early election call. Despite these issues, Farage remains optimistic about gaining a foothold in Parliament, positioning his party as the "real" opposition to the anticipated Labour government.</p>

<p>According to the anti-racism organisation Hope Not Hate, Reform UK has had to withdraw 166 candidates since the beginning of the year, many of whom have made racist or offensive remarks.</p>

<p>Sunakwarned voters that supporting Reform UK could inadvertently benefit the Labour Party, which he criticised for its tax policies. He also rebuked Farage for comments suggesting that Western actions provoked Russia's invasion of Ukraine, calling such statements damaging and appeasing to Vladimir Putin.</p>

<p>The UK will go to the polls on July 4.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Much of the southeast Caribbean was on alert Sunday as Beryl strengthened into the first hurricane of the 2024 Atlantic season, with forecasters warning of an "extremely dangerous" Category 4 storm.</p>

<p>The US National Hurricane Center (NHC) said Beryl -- currently churning in the Atlantic Ocean about 465 miles (750 kilometers) east of Barbados -- was expected to bring "life-threatening winds and storm surge" when it reaches the Windward Islands early Monday.</p>

<p>Warning the storm is "continuing to rapidly intensify," the NHC forecast it would become an "extremely dangerous Category 4 hurricane" by the time it hit Caribbean communities.</p>

<p>Barbados, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, and Grenada were all under hurricane warnings, while tropical storm warnings or watches were in effect for Martinique, Tobago and Dominica, the NHC said in its latest advisory.</p>

<p>Cars were seen lined up at gas stations Saturday in the Barbadian capital Bridgetown, while supermarkets and grocery stores were crowded with shoppers buying food, water and other supplies. Some households were already boarding up their properties.</p>

<p>A Category 3 or higher on the Saffir-Simpson scale is considered a major hurricane, and a Category 4 storm packs sustained winds of at least 130 miles per hour (209 kilometers per hour).</p>

<p>The NHC said that by around 5:00 am (0900 GMT) Sunday, Beryl's maximum sustained winds had increased to nearly 100 mph, with higher gusts.</p>

<p>Such a powerful storm forming this early in the Atlantic hurricane season -- which runs from early June to late November -- is extremely rare, experts said.</p>

<p>"Only five major (Category 3+) hurricanes have been recorded in the Atlantic before the first week of July. Beryl would be the sixth and earliest this far east in the tropical Atlantic," hurricane expert Michael Lowry posted on social media platform X.</p>

<p>"Hurricane conditions are expected in the hurricane warning area beginning early on Monday," the NHC said, warning of heavy rain, flooding and storm surge that could raise water levels as much as nine feet (2.7 meters) above normal.</p>

<p>"Devastating wind damage is expected where the eyewall of Beryl moves through portions of the Windward Islands," the NHC said, indicating wind speeds in some locations could be 30 percent stronger than those listed in their advisory.</p>

<p>The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said in late May that it expects this year to be an "extraordinary" hurricane season, with up to seven storms of Category 3 or higher.</p>

<p>The agency cited warm Atlantic ocean temperatures and conditions related to the weather phenomenon La Nina in the Pacific for the expected increase in storms.</p>

<p>Extreme weather events including hurricanes have become more frequent and more devastating in recent years as a result of climate change.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[NASA added that the pictures taken by Landsat “have been used to locate the forests and plan underwater surveys.”]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">NASA has shared a set of two pictures of Tristan da Cunha, the world's most remote inhabited island. The photos were captured by Landsat 9, which was launched from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California, US, in 2021.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the photos shared on Instagram, we get an aerial view of the remote island. In the first satellite image, we can see three islands in a triangle formation in the deep blue ocean. “The islands are mostly dark green. The larger island is toward the top right corner and has a white peak,” the description read.</p>

<p>In the next pic, which is a close-up shot of Tristan da Cunha, NASA has also highlighted an area on the island as “Queen Mary's Peak”. There is also a location tag on “Edinburg Of the Seven Seas”.</p>

<p>“The island is mostly circular with irregular edges. The peak is white. Below the peak, the landscape is light green and fades to darker green as it reaches the base. Dark blue ocean surrounds the island,” it added.</p>

<p>Along with the photos, NASA has shared a detailed note about Tristan da Cunha. The US Space Agency said that the island is situated approximately halfway between the southern tips of South America and Africa.</p>

<p>“Tristan da Cunha, often said to be the most remote inhabited island in the world, is the sort of place where seabirds outnumber people. It is part of an island group in the South Atlantic Ocean situated approximately halfway between the southern tips of South America and Africa.”</p>

<p>The agency added, “Offshore, underwater forests of giant kelp surround the islands. The kelp, Macrocystis pyrifera, is one of the fastest-growing seaweeds on the planet. Though suspended sediment may be discolouring the water in some areas, signs of kelp forests (green) are visible in several areas immediately offshore.”</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">A document titled "The Names of the Intelligencers" has now disclosed the hidden network of spies of England and Ireland's former Queen Elizabeth I.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The single sheet of paper has been lying undisturbed in the National Archives for over a century, as per a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jun/29/uncovered-428-year-old-secret-dossier-reveals-elizabeth-is-network-of-spies ">Guardian</a> report.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The report also mentioned that this paper is part of a 428-year-old&nbsp;secret dossier that once belonged to Robert Cecil, the spymaster for Queen Elizabeth. Cecil is also the man who discovered the Gunpowder Plot in 1605. Putting this document together with the dossier shows how Cecil used a secret spy network to watch European kings and queens for England.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Historian Stephen Alford, who is also a professor of early modern British history at the University of Leeds, found the list nearly 15 years ago. He believes it was England's “first properly organised secret service”. Alford has been working to reconstruct Cecil's files on each spy ever since he found the document.</p>

<p dir="ltr">“There were lots of names listed – some I recognised, people in or close to the privy council of Elizabeth I, and lots I didn't know. Eventually, I realised that the numbers next to their names were folio numbers and that this was really a contents page. That was a lightbulb moment,” said Mr Alford as per the report.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The list of spies had been placed in a “miscellaneous” folder by Victorian archivists. As per Mr Alford's beliefs, Cecil began to write the document in 1596.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">Mr Alford thinks that he is “probably the first scholar” to take an interest in this document. He also said, “The Victorians had a habit, where if they came across papers that didn't make sense to them, that were a little mysterious and couldn't be filed away in a neat and tidy way, they would scratch their heads and then stick them in a miscellaneous folder and ignore them. And that's where historians now find really interesting stuff.”&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">Mr Alford searched through old archives for relevant papers marked with small numbers matching the index. Many papers were damaged from poor storage in the Tower of London, often by rats and mice leaving stains and even bite marks. Despite these challenges, the documents survived.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Before Mr Alford's research, scholars believed Cecil had only a few scattered spies. However, he discovered Cecil had a well-organised network of over 20 spies in cities like Lisbon, Calais, Brussels, Seville, Rome, Amsterdam, Scotland, Sweden, and other places. Mr Alford said, “He (Cecil) chose merchants because they travel, can read and write, speak European languages and have networks of their own.”</p>

<p>“Melania has made a deal with her husband that if he wins the presidency she will not have to be on first lady duty 24/7,” a source was quoted as saying.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The report added that the former First Lady has made the deal as she wants to spend more time with her son Barron Trump. The 18-year-old will reportedly move to a University soon in New York City, and Melania Trump wants to help him adjust to the new life.</p>

<p>“She's a hands-on mother, and is already planning to spend part of every month — and potentially every week — in NYC,” the source added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The source continued, “Barron has never been completely on his own before — and with the added stress of him being both a freshman in college and potentially the son of a president in a predominantly Democratic city, [Melania] wants to be close… The added attention he'll get if his father is president worries Melania who is also concerned about the reaction at his school over Barron's ever-present Secret Service [detail].”</p>

<p dir="ltr">Melania Trump has been “&nbsp;an extremely protective mother” and she “even pushed back on the idea that Barron would serve as a Republican delegate to the [Republican National Convention] from Florida,” the report added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Donald Trump and Joe Biden are polling neck and neck ahead of the November 5 vote as they attempt to woo any Americans still fine-tuning their decision.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An Israeli citizen mistakenly entered the Palestinian town of Qalandiya, situated between Jerusalem and Ramallah, in West Bank and was soon met with aggression from local residents, leading to a violent confrontation.</p>

<p>Videos circulating on social media show a mob of Palestinians chasing the Israeli vehicle, hurling stones at it. The driver attempted to flee but ultimately lost control, crashing into a concrete divider near a military checkpoint, a <em>Times of Israel </em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog-june-30-2024/">report </a>said. The man reportedly suffered minor injuries before being rescued and transported to Jerusalem's Shaare Zedek hospital.</p>

<p>This incident comes amid a backdrop of escalating violence in the West Bank, an area under Israeli occupation since 1967. Last week, the Israeli military reported the death of a soldier and serious injury to another during an operation in Jenin, a city known for its militant presence. The Israeli army frequently conducts raids in Jenin and its adjacent refugee camp as part of its ongoing security operations.</p>

<p>The West Bank has seen a significant surge in violence, especially following the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza on October 7. Palestinian officials report that at least 553 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces or settlers in the West Bank since the conflict began. Meanwhile, attacks by Palestinians have resulted in the deaths of at least 15 Israelis, including soldiers, in the same period, according to news agency AFP.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A new portrait of King Charles in military attire has been unveiled in honour of Armed Forces Day. The photograph, captured in Windsor Castle's Grand Corridor, depicts the monarch seated in his Field Marshal's ceremonial dress adorned with medals, sword, and decorations.</p>

<p>The release of this image coincides with Queen Camilla's tribute to armed forces members, whom she described in a video message as a source of inspiration, reassurance, and pride.</p>

<p>Armed Forces Day, observed on the final Saturday in June, pays homage to veterans, military personnel, and service families, a tradition established in the UK in the late 2000s, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cv2gle48845o"><em>BBC </em></a>reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Photographed last November by Hugo Burnand, known for his royal photography including the King's 2023 coronation portraits, King Charles is adorned in the Field Marshal's uniform, the highest rank in the British Army. As monarch, he serves as ceremonial head of the armed forces.</p>

<p>During his recent attendance at D-Day commemorations in Normandy, France, King Charles donned a tan version of the Field Marshal's uniform.</p>

<p>In her video message from Clarence House, Queen Camilla praised the 'incredible bravery' of military personnel who initiated Europe's liberation from Nazi Germany in 1944.</p>

<p>She said that 80 years on, the "same spirit and those same qualities remain much in evidence throughout our Armed Forces", who "undertake your duties in the face of a multitude of challenges and dangers".</p>

<p>The Queen added: "In so doing, you not only protect these Isles, but also defend liberties way beyond these shores.</p>

<p>"Your determination, unrelenting efforts and selfless loyalty to each other and to the United Kingdom are as enduring as our gratitude."</p>

<p>The patron of the British Forces Broadcasting Service charity, responsible for the video, extended gratitude to the families of servicemen and women who maintain home life while their loved ones serve abroad.</p>

<p>Reflecting on her father Major Bruce Shand's service in North Africa and Dunkirk during World War Two, where he earned the Military Cross, the Queen remarked, 'As the daughter of an Army officer, I understand the profound impact military life has on families. You too are heroes.'"</p>

<p>"In times of war and in times of peace, whether seen or unseen, our armed forces support and strengthen our nation. You are a source of inspiration, reassurance and pride - and I salute you all."<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rishi Sunak scripted history on October 25, 2022, when he became the first Indian-origin Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. In the upcoming July 4 elections, Mr Sunak's Conservative Party is facing a major challenge from the Opposition Labour Party, led by Keir Starmer.<br />
<br />
<strong>Ahead of the crucial polls, here's a look at the 10 points about Rishi Sunak's connection with India:</strong><br />
<br />
1. Rishi Sunak was born on May 12, 1980, in Southampton, Hampshire. His parents -- Yashvir Sunak and Usha Sunak -- are of Indian descent. While his father was a National Health Service general practitioner, his mother, Usha, ran a chemist shop. Both of them migrated from East Africa to the UK during the 1960s.<br />
<br />
2. For his studies, Mr Sunak went to Winchester College and studied Politics, Philosophy and Economics at Oxford University. Further, he was also a Fulbright Scholar at Stanford University in the US, where he studied for his MBA.<br />
<br />
3. Rishi Sunak is married to Akshata Murty, the daughter of Infosys chief Narayana Murthy and Sudha Murty, who is a Rajya Sabha MP. Together, Rishi and Akshata have two daughters - Krishna and Anoushka.<br />
<br />
4.&nbsp; He has served as a Member of Parliament from Richmond (Yorks) since 2015. He earlier became the first UK parliamentarian to take oath as an MP on the Bhagavad Gita in the Parliament.<br />
<br />
5. Being a Hindu, he has often been vocal about his heritage and how his family reminded him about their values and culture.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
6. He celebrated Diwali with his wife and family at 10 Downing Street and even hosted a reception last year for the Indian diaspora, parliamentarians, entrepreneurs and Bollywood celebrities.<br />

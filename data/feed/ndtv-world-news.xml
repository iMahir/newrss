       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A South Korean appellate court on Thursday sentenced a former fiance of Olympic fencing medalist Nam Hyun-hee to 13 years in prison for swindling dozens of people out of more than 3.5 billion won ($2.5 million) under the guise of a chaebol heir.</p>

<p>The Seoul High Court handed down the sentence to Jeon Cheong-jo, 28, saying she continued to commit fraud even after being released from prison after serving time for previous fraud convictions, including by disguising herself as a man in order to date famous people, Yonhap news agency reported.</p>

<p>The ruling adds one year to a lower court's sentence of 12 years in prison.</p>

<p>"Most of the money was spent on purchasing luxury items, making it difficult to reverse the damage to victims," the court said, noting a total of 35 people were swindled out of a combined 3.5 billion won.</p>

<p>The court also cited a "very high risk of a repeat offence".</p>

<p>Jeon gained notoriety following revelations last year that she had been engaged to Nam, the silver medalist in women's foil at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, under the guise of a man claiming to be an heir to the Paradise Hotel chain. The couple later broke up.</p>

<p>In September, Jeon was sentenced to an additional four years in prison for assaulting and threatening Nam's nephew, but the appellate court combined the two cases at Jeon's request.</p>

<p>The prosecution had demanded a 20-year prison term for Jeon.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Scandal-plagued Matt Gaetz, who was nominated by President-elect Donald Trump to be US attorney general, on Thursday pulled out of the confirmation process in an early setback for the incoming administration.</p>

<p>Gaetz was one of Trump's several eye-catching selections, including Fox News host Pete Hegseth as defense secretary, vaccine skeptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as health secretary and billionaire Elon Musk to head a government cost-cutting unit.</p>

<p>A congressional panel had been investigating alleged illegal activity by Gaetz, including sexual misconduct with a 17-year-old girl -- which he denies -- as well as drug use and misappropriating campaign funds.</p>

<p>He was facing an uphill battle to win confirmation in the Senate for the top legal role of attorney general due to widespread opposition, including from within his own Republican Party.</p>

<p>"I had excellent meetings with Senators yesterday. I appreciate their thoughtful feedback -- and the incredible support of so many," Gaetz said on X.</p>

<p>"While the momentum was strong, it is clear that my confirmation was unfairly becoming a distraction to the critical work of the Trump/Vance Transition."</p>

<p>Gaetz was first elected to the US House of Representatives in 2016 and won reelection this month, but he resigned as a congressman shortly after Trump picked him to be attorney general.</p>

<p>"Matt has a wonderful future, and I look forward to watching all of the great things he will do," Trump said in response to his withdrawal.</p>

<p>Several of Trump's nominations have triggered criticism, and the latest transition turmoil came as new lurid details emerged about Defense nominee Hegseth.</p>

<p>He was investigated for sexual assault after a complaint from an unnamed woman at a 2017 conference in California.</p>

<p>The New York Times reported details from the police investigation, which was closed without Hegseth being charged.</p>

<p>The married woman told officers that she suffered from memory loss and thought her drink might have been spiked, while Hegseth said the encounter was consensual.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The International Criminal Court's move to issue arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and defence minister Yoav Gallant is a "dark moment" for the court, Israel's Ambassador to India Reuven Azar has said.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The International Criminal Court (ICC)'s move to issue arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and defence minister Yoav Gallant is a "dark moment" for the court, which acted "without authority" and set a "dangerous precedent", Israel's Ambassador to India Reuven Azar said on Thursday.</p>

<p>In a statement, Mr Azar alleged the world court in The Hague is "serving as a political tool for the most extreme elements working against peace, security and stability in West Asia". The decision to issue the warrants weakens the possibility of reaching a ceasefire deal with those seeking Israel's destruction, he said.</p>

<p>The remarks came hours after ICC issued the warrants of arrest for the two Israeli leaders for "crimes against humanity and war crimes committed from at least 8 October 2023 until at least 20 May 2024". The court also issued a similar warrant for Hamas military chief Mohammed Deif.</p>

<p>Israel said in early August it had killed Deif in an air strike in southern Gaza in July, but Hamas has not confirmed his death. Israel is currently engaged in a conflict with Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon.</p>

<p>The ICC has no power to enforce its warrants but technically, any country that has signed the Rome Statute - a treaty that seeks to prosecute individuals accused of genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and crimes of aggression - would be obliged to arrest Mr Netanyahu, Mr Gallant, or Mr Deif, if they travelled there.</p>

<p>"The ICC acted without authority against the elected leaders of a democracy which is not a member of the court. It's a dangerous precedent," Mr Azar said.</p>

<p>"These are warrants directed not only personally against our leaders. In fact, this is an attack on Israel's right to defend itself. The decision is a moral deficiency that turns good into bad and serves evil. The decision harms the ability of a democracy to fight terrorism," he added.</p>

<p>Mr Azar also said that the world court "completely ignores Israel's actions according to international law to facilitate humanitarian assistance to the Palestinian needy population and its outstanding actions to minimise civilian casualties despite despicable tactics used by the terrorists, including using civilians as human shields."</p>

<p>"As a democracy, Israel has a strong legal system that is capable, able and willing to check the actions of its government. We call all our friends to publicly reject this injustice," he said.</p>

<p>On October 7 last year, Hamas militants conducted a cross-border raid on Israel that killed 1,206 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures. Israel has since then been fighting a war in Gaza, which the militant group rules.</p>

<p>Israel, however, has faced growing international criticism over its conduct of the Gaza war, including from its allies, despite global solidarity with the victims of October 7.</p>

<p>The Hamas government's health ministry in the Gaza Strip said on Thursday that at least 44,056 people have been killed in more than 13 months of war.</p>

<p>Hezbollah, the powerful Iran-backed Lebanese militant group, began firing rockets into Israel in October last year in stated support of Hamas.</p>

<p>After nearly a year of limited exchanges of fire on the Israel-Lebanon border, Israel in September this year intensified its air strikes primarily targeting Hezbollah strongholds and later sent ground troops into Lebanon.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russia's use of a new medium-range ballistic missile to strike Ukraine was a "worrying development," the spokesman for UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said Thursday.</p>

<p>"This is yet another concerning and worrying development. All of this (is) going in the wrong direction," said Stephane Dujarric, calling on all parties to de-escalate the conflict.</p>

<p>He repeated UN chief Antonio Guterres's call for an end to the war in compliance with international law, and urged both sides "to protect civilians, not hit civilian targets or critical civilian infrastructure."</p>

<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin said Thursday that his country's forces had hit Ukraine with a new mid-range hypersonic ballistic missile, dubbed the "Oreshnik," in a "non-nuclear" configuration.</p>

<p>Russia struck the central Ukrainian city of Dnipro with a barrage of missiles early Thursday.</p>

<p>This week, the United States further ramped up aid to its Ukrainian ally by authorizing the supply of anti-personnel landmines, a major policy shift slammed by rights groups.</p>

<p>Asked about the US decision, Dujarric reiterated the UN's opposition to the use of those weapons.</p>

<p>"Our stand against the use of mines anywhere in the world remains the same," he said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A draft text released early Thursday on a new climate finance package for the developing world was rejected by every single country signatory to the UN climate convention.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A draft text released early Thursday on a new climate finance package for the developing world was rejected by every single country signatory to the UN climate convention.</p>

<p>The COP29 presidency, however, said the draft was far from final and invited countries to submit bridging proposals.</p>

<p>The next version, due Thursday night, will be leaner and packed with numbers aimed at finding the sweet spot for consensus, it said in a statement.</p>

<p>The text shows that developed countries are still dodging a key question: how much climate finance are they ready to provide developing countries every year starting in 2025? The developing world has repeatedly said it needs at least USD 1.3 trillion annually -- 13 times the USD 100 billion pledged in 2009 -- to meet the growing challenges.</p>

<p>Although developed countries have yet to officially propose a figure, their negotiators indicated that European Union nations were discussing a global climate finance target of USD 200 billion to USD 300 billion per year.</p>

<p>However, in the words of Colombian Environment Minister Susana Muhamad, the critical objective of this COP is, right now, an "empty placeholder".</p>

<p>The problem is not that developed countries lack money; the problem is that they are playing geopolitics, she said in an impassioned speech, drawing applause from a plenary full of negotiators, observers, and journalists.</p>

<p>The G77, the largest negotiating bloc at the UN climate talks with over 130 developing nations, said they have been very clear that "we should not leave Baku without a quantum".</p>

<p>Adonia Ayebare, the G77 chair, denounced the developed countries' attempt to turn the climate finance package into a global investment goal that would draw funding from a variety of sources, including governments, private companies and investors.</p>

<p>"We are disappointed that the draft text doesn't even specify a quantum for provisional mobilization," said Bolivia's Diego Pacheco, on behalf of Like-Minded Developing Countries, which includes India.</p>

<p>African Group of Negotiators chair Ali Mohamed said they were deeply concerned by the "lack of mention of quantum". "This quantum is the main mandate for which we are here at COP29." European Union's climate chief Wopke Hoekstra called the draft "imbalanced, unworkable, and not acceptable".</p>

<p>Panama's negotiator Juan Carlos Monterrey Gomez said developed countries call developing countries' proposal for USD 1.3 trillion a year in climate finance "extreme and unreasonable". "Let me tell you what is extreme and unreasonable, spending USD 7 trillion on fossil fuel subsidies".</p>

<p>"Developed countries must stop playing games with our life and put a serious quantified financial proposal on the table," he said.</p>

<p>Pakistan, still reeling from the aftermath of the devastating 2022 floods, said an ambitious outcome on the climate finance package was particularly important for them, but the text lacked "concrete numbers on the quantum.</p>

<p>At the heart of this year's UN climate talks is the new climate finance goal or NCQG aimed at helping developing countries cut emissions and cope with the mounting impacts of climate change.</p>

<p>Developing nations argue they need at least USD 1.3 trillion a year to keep up with the escalating challenges.</p>

<p>But trust is in short supply. Developed nations only hit the USD 100 billion target in 2022 -- two years late -- and a hefty 70 per cent of those funds came as loans, further straining nations already reeling from climate disasters.</p>

<p>Now, developing nations are demanding that most of the funding come straight from developed countries' public coffers. They reject the idea of leaning on the private sector, which they say is more interested in profit than accountability.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the US and EU are pushing for a more expansive global investment goal that draws from public, private, domestic, and international sources. They are also urging wealthier countries like China and Gulf states -- classified as developing in 1992 -- to chip in, pointing to their more prosperous status today.</p>

<p>Developing nations see this as a clever move to avoid responsibility for past emissions by shifting the burden to those who industrialized more recently.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin said Thursday that the country's forces had hit Ukraine with a new mid-range ballistic missile.</p>

<p>Putin said in a televised address that Russia carried out "testing in combat conditions of one of the newest Russian mid-range missile systems... Our engineers named it Oreshnik," which means hazel tree in Russian.</p>

<p>Russia struck the central Ukrainian city of Dnipro with a barrage of missiles early Thursday.</p>

<p>The Ukrainian air force and President Volodymyr Zelensky accused Russia of apparently using an intercontinental ballistic missile, while Ukrainian experts were still examining the evidence to ascertain the type of missile used.</p>

<p>Putin said in his address that Russia launched a combined strike on a defence industry target in Ukraine.</p>

<p>He described Oreshnik as a "ballistic missile" that was deployed in this case "in a non-nuclear hypersonic configuration", saying that the "test" had been successful and had hit its target.</p>

<p>Air defences cannot intercept the Oreshnik, which attacks at a speed of Mach 10, or 2.5-3 kilometres per second, Putin said.</p>

<p>"Modern air defence systems... cannot intercept such missiles. That's impossible," he said.</p>

<p>"As of today there are no means of counteracting such a weapon," the president boasted.</p>

<p>He said Russia was testing the Oreshnik in combat conditions "in response to the aggressive actions of NATO countries towards Russia."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Showcasing the strong ties between the two countries, Indian Army Chief Gen Upendra Dwivedi was on Thursday conferred with the prestigious rank of Honourary General of the Nepali Army.</p>

<p>This exchange of honourary generalship, a unique and cherished tradition between the Indian and Nepali Armies, highlights the deep-rooted historical, cultural, and military ties between the two nations.</p>

<p>General Dwivedi reached Kathmandu on Wednesday on a five-day official visit upon the invitation of General Ashok Raj Sigdel, Chief of the Army Staff, Nepali Army.</p>

<p>The tradition of conferring honourary generalships between the Indian and Nepali Armies dates back to the 1950s. Every three years, the Chief of the Indian Army is made an Honourary General of the Nepali Army, and vice versa.</p>

<p>This practice reflects the mutual respect and enduring friendship between the two countries, particularly in the realms of military cooperation, defence collaboration, and shared strategic interests, a release said.</p>

<p>This symbolic exchange of titles goes beyond mere ceremony--it is a powerful testament to the longstanding solidarity, trust, and commitment to peace and stability in the region.</p>

<p>The tradition underscores the strong strategic partnership between the two forces, who work closely on a variety of fronts, including joint training, military exercises, and disaster response.</p>

<p>Both armies share similar values and a commitment to regional security, making this gesture of honour a reflection of their unity and shared purpose.</p>

<p>The Honourary Generalship is particularly meaningful given the unique socio-cultural bonds and open borders between India and Nepal. With shared security interests and a deep sense of camaraderie, the exchange of titles serves as a reminder of the close ties that transcend formal diplomatic relations.</p>

<p>It reinforces the enduring friendship and cooperation that have defined the relationship between the two nations for decades.</p>

<p>General Dwivedi's visit and the conferral of this honour will not only strengthen military ties but also serve as a reflection of the deep respect between the two countries' armed forces, further advancing the spirit of cooperation and mutual understanding.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel and its allies denounced the International Criminal Court's decision to issue an arrest warrant Thursday for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, even as Turkey -- and rights groups - welcomed the move.</p>

<p>The court also issued warrants for Israel's former defence minister as well as Hamas's military chief Mohammed Deif.</p>

<p>They were issued in response to accusations of crimes against humanity and war crimes in Israel's war on Hamas in Gaza, set off by the militant Palestinian group's October 7, 2023 attack.</p>

<h3><strong>Israel: New 'Dreyfus trial'</strong></h3>

<p>"The anti-Semitic decision of the International Criminal Court is comparable to the modern-day Dreyfus trial -- and it will end in the same way," Netanyahu said in a statement.</p>

<p>He was referring to the 19th-century Alfred Dreyfus affair in which a Jewish army captain was wrongly convicted of treason in France before being exonerated.</p>

<h3><strong>US: 'Fundamentally rejects'</strong></h3>

<p>The United States "fundamentally rejects" the ICC's decision and "we remain deeply concerned by the prosecutor's rush to seek arrest warrants and the troubling process errors that led to this decision", said a National Security Council spokesperson.</p>

<p>"The United States has been clear that the ICC does not have jurisdiction over this matter."</p>

<h3><strong>Argentina: 'Deep disagreement'</strong></h3>

<p>Argentina "declares its deep disagreement" with the decision, which "ignores Israel's legitimate right to self-defence against the constant attacks by terrorist organisations like Hamas and Hezbollah," President Javier Milei posted on X.</p>

<h3><strong>Hamas: 'Justice'</strong></h3>

<p>"(It's) an important step towards justice and can lead to redress for the victims in general, but it remains limited and symbolic if it is not supported by all means by all countries around the world," Hamas political bureau member Bassem Naim said of the warrants against Israeli politicians.</p>

<h3><strong>European Union: 'Binding'</strong></h3>

<p>"It is not a political decision," said EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell, speaking during a visit to Jordan.</p>

<p>"It is a decision of a court, of a court of justice, of an international court of justice. And the decision of the court has to be respected and implemented."</p>

<h3><strong>Israeli victims: 'Significant'</strong></h3>

<p>"This arrest warrant against Mr Deif is massively significant," said Yael Vias Gvirsman, who represents 300 Israeli victims of the October 7 Hamas attacks.</p>

<p>"It means these victims' voices are being heard," she added, speaking from outside the court in The Hague.</p>

<h3><strong>Palestinian Authority: 'Sign of hope'</strong></h3>

<p>The Palestinian Authority, a rival of Hamas, said "the ICC's decision represents hope and confidence in international law and its institutions".</p>

<p>It urged ICC members to enforce "a policy of severing contact and meetings' with Netanyahu and Gallant.</p>

<h3><strong>Amnesty International: 'Wanted man'</strong></h3>

<p>"Prime Minister Netanyahu is now officially a wanted man," said Amnesty's Secretary General Agnes Callamard.</p>

<p>"ICC member states and the whole international community must stop at nothing until these individuals are brought to trial before the ICC's independent and impartial judges."</p>

<h3><strong>Human Rights Watch: not 'beyond' the law</strong></h3>

<p>"The ICC arrest warrants against senior Israeli leaders and a Hamas official break through the perception that certain individuals are beyond the reach of the law."</p>

<h3><strong>Turkey: 'Positive decision'</strong></h3>

<p>The ICC's decision "is a belated but positive decision to stop the bloodshed and put an end to the genocide in Palestine," Turkish Justice Minister Yilmaz Tunc said on X.</p>

<p>Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan welcomed the warrants as "an extremely important step".</p>

<h3><strong>Italy: 'Will evaluate'</strong></h3>

<p>"We support the ICC, while always remembering that the court must play a legal role and not a political role," said Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani.</p>

<p>"We will evaluate together with our allies what to do and how to interpret this decision."</p>

<h3><strong>Norway: 'Confidence'</strong></h3>

<p>"It is important that the ICC carries out its mandate in a judicious manner. I have confidence that the court will proceed with the case based on the highest fair trial standards," Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide said.</p>

<h3><strong>Sweden: 'Independence and integrity'</strong></h3>

<p>"Sweden and the EU support the important work of the court and safeguard its independence and integrity," Foreign Minister Maria Malmer Stenergard said.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A US ballistic missile defence base in Poland, which may 'lead to an increase in the overall level of nuclear danger', is now on Russia's target list for possible destruction is needed, Moscow confirmed.</p>

<p>The new base in the town of Redzikowo near the Baltic Sea, part of the broader NATO shield against Russia, was opened last week.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"This is another frankly provocative step in a series of deeply destabilising actions by the Americans and their allies in the North Atlantic Alliance in the strategic sphere," Reuters reported quoting Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">? <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Zakharova?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Zakharova</a>: The so-called US missile defence base (not really) in Poland has been put on the list of priority targets for potential elimination.<br />
<br />
The nature and level of threats posed by these Western military facilities are well-known &amp; taken into account. <a href="https://t.co/qzDqvTKXox">pic.twitter.com/qzDqvTKXox</a></p>

<p>"This leads to undermining strategic stability, increasing strategic risks and, as a result, to an increase in the overall level of nuclear danger."</p>

<p>NATO took control of the Aegis Ashore Missile Defence System (AAMDS) amid the ongoing Russia-Ukraine which completed its 1,000 days.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I am very glad that we are officially opening this base which will, just like the United States military, defend freedom and security in the world, Polish President Andrzej Duda said.</p>

<p>Poland joined the alliance in 1999. Sweden is the latest entrant in the alliance, it joined NATO this year. Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania - the three Baltic states - are also part of NATO and share a land border with Russia.</p>

<p>On the Ukraine front, the US has allowed Kyiv to use long-range ATACMS to strike deep into Russia, a restriction which was earlier placed by the White House to avoid any escalation in the war. UK-made Storm Shadow cruise missiles were used by Ukraine for the first time against Russia. <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/have-right-to-strike-putins-veiled-warning-to-us-uk-7074719">Meanwhile, Russian President Vladimir Putin</a> said Moscow has the right to strike military targets of countries whose weapons are used by Ukraine to hit Russian territory. A veiled warning to London and Washington.</p>

<h3><strong>Russia's NATO Expansion Narrative</strong></h3>

<p>Russia sees NATO's eastward expansion as a threat to its security and a violation of a so-called promise the US made to the USSR that the military alliance would not move further east in the aftermath of the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. Then Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev agreed to Germany's incorporation into NATO in 1990 and then US Secretary of State, James Baker, had told Gorbachev that it would not move beyond the inner German border, but Washington retreated from its position, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.chathamhouse.org/2021/05/myths-and-misconceptions-debate-russia/myth-03-russia-was-promised-nato-would-not-enlarge" rel="noindex,nofollow">a report from Chatham House said.&nbsp;</a></p>

<p>One of the basis of the claim is then-German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher's speech in 1990, where he said, "No matter what happens in the Warsaw Pact countries, there will be no expansion of NATO territory to the east, that is, closer to the borders of the Soviet Union." This was made before the collapse of the USSR and the creation of independent nations in Eastern Europe.</p>

<p>Even Gorbachev in some interviews agreed about the existence of the verbal "agreement" but also refuted it in some. The narrative has been actively used by the Russians to justify actions in Ukraine, claiming that the US has moved further, threatening national security.</p>

<p>But, in 2018, French President Emmanuel Macron, at the 2018 St Petersburg International Economic Forum, said "I think that the mistake that was made in the last 20 years was that we in NATO failed to fully comply with all the obligations we had taken on, and this caused certain fears, quite reasonable ones. And we did not have the trust that Russia rightfully expected."</p>

<p>After the Russia-Ukraine war, many scholars have argued that the expansion of NATO has been a trigger to the war.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Philippe Lazzarini, Commissioner-General of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), said that Gaza has become a 'graveyard' for children.</p>

<p>"They are being killed, injured, forced to flee, and deprived of safety, education, and play," Lazzarini said in a statement marking World Children's Day, observed annually on November 20, Xinhua news agency reported.</p>

<p>"Their childhood has been stolen, and they are on the verge of becoming a lost generation, having lost another school year," Lazzarini said.</p>

<p>He noted that children in the West Bank are enduring constant fear and anxiety. Since last October, more than 170 children have been killed, while many others have lost their childhood to detention in Israeli facilities.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, Palestinian groups called for international action to protect children in Gaza and the West Bank, highlighting the catastrophic humanitarian conditions they are enduring.</p>

<p>The Palestinian Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement emphasising that children are the most vulnerable and affected by Israeli practices, enduring dire conditions that violate their fundamental rights, including the right to life.</p>

<p>The ministry warned that children in Gaza face a real threat, with hundreds of thousands estimated to be suffering from severe shortages of food and clean drinking water.</p>

<p>The statement also emphasised that children in the West Bank are consistently subjected to the same 'criminal' policies, such as arbitrary detention, and face illegal trials, which blatantly violate their rights under international agreements.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Palestinian National Council said that children in Gaza are 'paying the heavy price' since October 2023, "in full view of the world, which remains unable to stop this genocide."</p>

<p>A statement issued by the council on the occasion noted that the bodies of Gaza's children have been exposed to various weapons, including rockets and bombs, as well as "the most horrific images of killing and destruction," with many dying from hunger, thirst, and diseases due to the siege. Thousands of children have become orphans.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russia's strike on Ukraine was not an ICBM, but an "experimental" medium-range ballistic missile, a US official said Thursday, playing down the significance of the attack.</p>

<p>"Russia may be seeking to use this capability to try to intimidate Ukraine and its supporters... but it will not be a game changer in this conflict," the US official said.</p>

<p>Ukraine accused Russia on Thursday of having launched a nuclear-capable intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) as part of a barrage on the central city of Dnipro.</p>

<p>The US official said the missile used in the strike was not an ICBM but an "experimental medium-range ballistic missile" and Russia "likely possesses only a handful of these experimental missiles."</p>

<p>"Ukraine has withstood countless attacks from Russia, including from missiles with significantly larger warheads than this weapon," the official said.</p>

<p>The United States briefed Ukraine and allies in recent days about Russia's possible use of the weapon, the official said.</p>

<p>The US official also recalled that President Joe Biden had announced plans earlier this year to provide Ukraine with hundreds of Patriot and AMRAAM missiles to strengthen its air defenses.</p>

<p>"The United States will continue to surge security assistance to Ukraine to strengthen capabilities, including air defense, and put Ukraine in the best possible position on the battlefield," the official said.</p>

<p>Tension has been building between Moscow and Kyiv's allies in the West since Ukrainian forces struck Russian territory with Western-supplied long-range weapons on Tuesday after getting the green light from Washington.</p>

<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the missile strike on Dnipro bore "all the characteristics" of an ICBM attack and accused the Kremlin of "using Ukraine as a testing ground."</p>

<p>Local authorities in Dnipro said an infrastructure facility was hit and two civilians were wounded.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Scandal-plagued Matt Gaetz, who was nominated by President-elect Donald Trump to be US attorney general, on Thursday pulled out of the confirmation process in an early setback for the incoming administration.</p>

<p>Gaetz was one of Trump's several eye-catching selections, including Fox News host Pete Hegseth as defense secretary, vaccine skeptic Robert F Kennedy Jr. as health secretary and billionaire Elon Musk to head a government cost-cutting unit.</p>

<p>A congressional panel had been investigating alleged illegal activity by Gaetz, including sexual misconduct with a 17-year-old girl -- which he denies -- as well as drug use and misappropriating campaign funds.</p>

<p>He was facing an uphill battle to win confirmation in the Senate for the top legal role of attorney general due to widespread opposition, including from within his own Republican Party.</p>

<p>"I had excellent meetings with Senators yesterday. I appreciate their thoughtful feedback -- and the incredible support of so many," Gaetz said on X.</p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p>"While the momentum was strong, it is clear that my confirmation was unfairly becoming a distraction to the critical work of the Trump/Vance Transition."</p>

<p>Gaetz was first elected to the US House of Representatives in 2016 and won reelection this month, but he resigned as a congressman shortly after Trump picked him to be attorney general.</p>

<p>"Matt has a wonderful future, and I look forward to watching all of the great things he will do," Trump said in response to his withdrawal.</p>

<p>Several of Trump's nominations have triggered criticism, and the latest transition turmoil came as new lurid details emerged about Defense nominee Hegseth.</p>

<p>He was investigated for sexual assault after a complaint from an unnamed woman at a 2017 conference in California.</p>

<p>The New York Times reported details from the police investigation, which was closed without Hegseth being charged.</p>

<p>The married woman told officers that she suffered from memory loss and thought her drink might have been spiked, while Hegseth said the encounter was consensual.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Communications Minister Michelle Rowland says platforms like TikTok, Facebook, Snapchat, Reddit, X and Instagram fall under the umbrella of the law.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Australia's government plans to fine global social media firms $32 million for systemic breaches against a bill that it introduced on Thursday that seeks to ban social media for children under 16 years of age. Communications Minister Michelle Rowland says platforms like TikTok, Facebook, Snapchat, Reddit, X and Instagram fall under the umbrella of the law.</p>

<p>The "world-leading", as Prime Minister Anthony Albanese calls it, bill forces social media firms to ensure age verifications are in place and does not place that onus on parents or children.</p>

<p>"Social media has a social responsibility ... that's why we are making big changes to hold platforms to account for user safety," Rowland said. "This bill seeks to set a new normative value in society that accessing social media is not the defining feature of growing up in Australia," she added.</p>

<p>Although the children can access online gaming, messaging, online classrooms, YouTube or just health and education related services in general.</p>

<p>"This is a landmark reform. We know some kids will find workarounds, but we're sending a message to social media companies to clean up their act," Albanese said in a statement.</p>

<p>Meta and X have thrown the ball in the court of application stores like Google and Apple to reinforce age verification rather than the social platforms.</p>

<p>It plans to bring about on a trial basis, an age-verification system such as biometrics or a government identification in order to access social media. This is being touted as some of the most stringent controls imposed by any country till date and does not even exempt parental consent or pre-existing accounts.</p>

<p>The current Australian government is of the view that social media causes more harm than good to the physical and mental health of children, burdening girls with body image issues and zeroing in on boys with misogynistic content.</p>

<p>However, Katie Maskiell from UNICEF Australia says that this ban will only push young people onto, "covert and unregulated online spaces".</p>

<p>Last year, France intended to do the same with children under 15, but children could avoid the ban citing parental consent.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Although Norway imposed a minimum age of 13 to access social media, the surveys found that 70 per cent of 11 year-olds were still using social media platforms.</p>

<p>"For too many young Australians, social media can be harmful. Almost two-thirds of 14 to 17-year-old Australians have viewed extremely harmful content online, including drug abuse, suicide or self-harm," Rowland said on Thursday.</p>

<p>Australia also plans to ban pornography for children under 18 years of age.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the golden years, this city witnessed a significant economic boom. It remains one of the most liveable cities in the world, a financial power hub and also an emerging city for sex tourism, with men wandering on the streets, looking for women.</p>

<p>The city is not where you are thinking. Apart from Bangkok in Thailand, Tokyo is emerging as a hotbed for sex tourism, with multiple factors driving the interest among foreign tourists, one of them being the weakening of the Japanese Yen against other currencies and robust inbound tourism.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.thestar.com.my/aseanplus/aseanplus-news/2024/11/17/welcome-to-tokyo-asias-new-sex-tourism-capital" rel="noindex,nofollow">The Star</a> reported quoting, Yoshihide Tanaka, secretary general of the Liaison Council Protecting Youths (Seiboren), that "Japan has become a poor country." Adding, that a park next to his organisation has become synonymous with the city's sex trade. He said they had noticed an increasing number of foreigners frequenting the park as soon as pandemic-era travel restrictions were dropped.</p>

<p>"Now we are seeing a lot more foreign men," he said. "They come from many countries. They are white, Asian, black - but the majority are Chinese," he said. This influx has coincided with a troubling rise in teenagers and women in their early twenties turning to the sex industry to survive, Tanaka said.</p>

<p>"The reality is that Japan has become a country where foreign men can obtain young women and essentially buy sexual services," <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2024/10/06/japan/society/japan-sex-tourism/" rel="noindex,nofollow">Japan Times</a> reported quoting Kazunori Yamanoi of the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, the country's main opposition party. "This is no longer just a domestic issue," he said. "It's a very serious problem regarding how Japanese women are perceived in the international community."</p>

<p>The cops have been cracking down on such activities. <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/20241119_29/" rel="noindex,nofollow">Earlier this week</a>, the Tokyo Metropolitan Police arrested five people on suspicion of violating Japan's Employment Security Act. They were allegedly running an operation to recruit women through social media to work in the sex industry. According to police, the suspects' group signed contracts with about 350 shops nationwide and recruited women through social media.</p>

<p>Financial distress suffered by women during Covid-19 is a major factor pushing them into the sex trade, with many wanting to pay off their debts. Some simply want to spend money at host clubs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Japan Times earlier reported that establishments, where men flirt with women over food and drink, like host clubs, put women in an endless cycle of debt through malicious schemes. These clubs have been linked to an increase in sex work, including illegal operations overseas and street solicitors, the report said.</p>

<p>According to the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD), around 43% of women arrested while working the street in 2023 said they started selling their bodies to pay for host clubs and underground male idols. About 80% of those arrested were in their 20s, while three were 19 or younger.</p>

<p>The loopholes in the law and poor implementation of the existing ones have put women in vulnerable positions, often exposing them to physical violence and sexually transmitted diseases. In countries like The Netherlands, prostitution is legal but the industry is highly regulated to ensure the protection of women&nbsp;with increased vigilance in combating human trafficking and other forms of criminal activity, but sex trafficking still remains a pressing issue in the country.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United States "fundamentally rejects" a decision by the International Criminal Court to issue arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former defence minister Yoav Gallant, the White House said Thursday.</p>

<p>"We remain deeply concerned by the Prosecutor's rush to seek arrest warrants and the troubling process errors that led to this decision. The United States has been clear that the ICC does not have jurisdiction over this matter," a National Security Council spokesperson said.</p>

<p>The statement made no mention of an ICC arrest warrant also issued for Mohammed Deif, the military chief of Hamas.</p>

<p>Mike Waltz, the incoming national security advisor under US President-elect Donald Trump's administration, defended Israel and promised a "strong response to the antisemitic bias of the ICC &amp; UN come January."</p>

<p>"The ICC has no credibility and these allegations have been refuted by the US government," Waltz said on X.</p>

<p>His comments reflected a wider outrage among Republicans, with some calling for the US Senate to sanction the ICC, which counts 124 national members who are in theory obliged to arrest individuals subject to warrants.</p>

<p>Neither the United States nor Israel is a member of the ICC and both have rejected its jurisdiction.</p>

<p>The Hague-based court said Thursday that the warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant were issued "for crimes against humanity and war crimes committed from at least 8 October 2023 until at least 20 May 2024."</p>

<p>A warrant was also issued for Deif, whom Israel claimed was killed in an air strike in Gaza in July, but Hamas has not confirmed his death.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a historic moment, Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed the Parliament in Guyana today. He is the first Indian prime minister in 56 years to visit the Caribbean nation. In his speech, PM Modi emphasised on the special bond between the two nations as highlighted the age-old ties which exist from the first Indians who migrated over 180 years ago.</p>

<p>PM Modi began his address to the parliamentarians in Guyana by saying, "I am here today in the capacity of India's Prime Minister, but I've come to your beautiful country before - 24 years ago - as someone who was curious to know more about your country, its people, and the Caribbean region."</p>

<p>"India and Guyana share a deep bond - a relationship of trust, hard work, and mutual respect," PM Modi said in his opening remarks. He further noted that the two nations share common democratic values, and that, he said, is the way forward.</p>

<p>"For the world today, the strongest <em>mantra</em> to move forward is 'Democracy First-Humanity First'," he said. The prime minister, who had said over a year ago that 'This is not an era for war', today added to it by saying, "This is an era of cooperation, not conflict", as he explained further that "Democracy is the way forward, not expansionism."</p>

<p>Giving India's example, he said, "Wherever the need arose, be it due to conflicts, calamities, economic crises, or even the pandemic, India selflessly worked for the benefit of the entire world. From Sri Lanka, Nepal, and Maldives in the neighbourhood to Turkiye and Syria, when there were calamities and crises, India acted as a responsible nation by being the first-responder. Because that is deep rooted in our ancient values."</p>

<p>He further said that "India has never moved forward with ill intent or greed. We have never worked with an expansionist mindset. India has never fostered ties with any nation with the ill-intent of exploiting or capturing resources. We have always stayed away from doing that. Be it Sea or Space, these should be issues of universal cooperation, not universal conflict."</p>

<p>"It is a time countries to identify the conditions that cause conflict and address them," he said.</p>

<p>PM Modi went on to say "Today, 'democracy first, humanity first' is the strongest mantra to move ahead. The spirit of 'democracy first' teaches us to take everyone along and participate in everyone's development. The spirit of 'humanity first' decides the direction of our decisions. When 'humanity first' is made the basis of decisions, the results prove to be beneficial for humanity."</p>

<p>He said that in the spirit of 'Democracy First, Humanity First', India is also doing its duty as a 'Vishwa Bandhu', acting as first responders in times of crisis.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[Linger endured 97 days of hospitalisation and was subjected to seven sessions of electroshock therapy during her stay.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A transgender woman in China has made history by winning a record-breaking payout of 60,000 yuan (Rs 6,92,637) after being subjected to involuntary electroshock treatment&nbsp;in a psychiatric hospital. According to the <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/21/transgender-woman-wins-record-payout-in-china-after-electroshock-treatment">Guardian</a></em>,&nbsp;the Changli County People's Court in Qinhuangdao, Hebei, awarded the amount to Ling'er, a 28-year-old performance artist and transgender woman. Born male but identifying as female, Ling'er's case marked a significant milestone in the country's recognition of LGBTQ+ right</p>

<p>Ling'er expressed hope that her case—the first in China where a transgender individual successfully challenged electroshock conversion practices—would inspire others in the LGBTQ+ community to address medical disputes and safeguard their rights. ''In China, the situation for transgender people is not very optimistic. There's a lack of protection for this group," she said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Her harrowing experience began in July 2022 when she was involuntarily admitted to Qinhuangdao City Fifth Hospital. Having come out as transgender to her parents the previous year, she faced strong opposition, with her family dismissing her gender identity as a sign of mental instability. Consequently, they committed her to a psychiatric facility.</p>

<p>During her stay at the hospital, the staff misdiagnosed Ling'er with "anxiety disorder and discordant sexual orientation", despite her identifying as heterosexual. Ling'er endured 97 days of hospitalisation and was subjected to seven sessions of electroshock therapy during her stay.</p>

<p>"It caused serious damage to my body. Every time I underwent the treatment, I would faint … I didn't agree to it, but I had no choice. The hospital tried to ‘correct me', to make me conform to society's expectations," Ling'er said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The electroshock treatments&nbsp;caused ongoing heart problems which require medication.&nbsp;Determined to seek justice, she filed a lawsuit against the hospital which reached the courts. She argued that her rights had been violated by the treatments.&nbsp;Under China's mental health law, individuals can only be subjected to psychiatric treatment against their will if they pose a danger to themselves or others.</p>

<p>Darius Longarino, a research scholar at Yale Law School who focuses on Chinese law and civil society, said doctors who administered medicines or used electroshock practices to "convert" gay or trans people were "using intrusive, harmful treatments in order to treat something that should not be diagnosed in the first place".&nbsp;</p>

<p>LGBTQ+ activists hailed the decision as a breakthrough, paving the way for greater inclusivity and acceptance.</p>

<p>This case isn't the first time a Chinese court has ruled in favour of a transgender individual. In 2020, a Beijing court ruled that e-commerce company Dangdang should reinstate a transgender woman's contract and provide full back pay after she was fired for taking leave for sex reassignment surgery. The court also emphasised the importance of respecting the woman's gender identity and providing access to the women's bathroom.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi today addressed the Special Session of the Guyanese Parliament during his visit to the South American country on the third and final leg of his three-nation tour. During his address, PM Modi talked about the history of India-Guyana ties and about his visit to Guyana fourteen years ago. Prime Minister Narendra Modi highlighted the two countries' mutual love of cricket, music and 'chutney' while comparing their cultures. Whether it's Guyanese or Indian chutney, he said, both are equally delightful.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/democracy-first-humanity-first-pm-modis-mantra-in-guyana-parliament-address-7073519#pfrom=home-ndtv_topstories"><strong>Also Read | "Democracy First, Humanity First": PM Modi's Mantra In Guyana Parliament Address</strong></a></p>

<p>In India, chutney is primarily known as a condiment, a flavorful edible sauce often served with meals. However, in the Caribbean countries such as Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, Suriname, Jamaica, and other parts of the region, the term 'chutney' takes on a different meaning. It is also used to describe a vibrant genre of music that blends Indian rhythms with Caribbean influences, showcasing the fusion of cultures in the region.</p>

<p><strong>What is Chutney Music?</strong></p>

<p>Chutney music is a vibrant fusion of Indian folk music, primarily Bhojpuri, with the infectious rhythms of Caribbean calypso and soca. Born in Trinidad and Tobago, this genre has spread its popularity across the Caribbean, reaching as far as Fiji, Mauritius, and South Africa. Emerging in the mid-20th century, chutney music experienced its golden age in the 1980s, giving rise to numerous sub-genres.</p>

<p><strong>Here are a few videos of Chutney music:</strong><br />

<p>In his opening remarks, PM Modi said Guyana gave him its highest honour on Wednesday. "I express my heartfelt gratitude to all of you, to every citizen of Guyana, for this honour. Thank you very much to all the citizens here. I dedicate this honour to every citizen of India."</p>

<p>Earlier, PM Modi met the top leaders of Caribbean nations such as St. Lucia, Antigua and Barbuda, Grenada, Barbados, Bahamas, Trinidad &amp; Tobago, Suriname, and Dominica on the sidelines of the second India-CARICOM Summit here and discussed strengthening bilateral ties and enhancing cooperation across several key areas. Prime Minister Modi met his Barbados counterpart Mia Amor Mottley on Wednesday.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle has agreed to testify before the U.S. House of Representatives Oversight Committee on July 22 for a hearing related to the shooting of former President Donald Trump at a rally, the panel said on Wednesday.</p>

<p><strong>WHY IT IS IMPORTANT</strong></p>

<p>Security at the Republican presidential candidate's rally in Pennsylvania has been under scrutiny after the former president was shot on Saturday at the event. The FBI said it was probing the shooting as an assassination attempt.</p>

<p>The shooting has raised serious concerns about how the suspect was able to access a nearby rooftop with a direct line of sight to where Trump was speaking.</p>

<p>Trump has since said he was doing well and has appeared at the Republican National Convention this week but the shooting left his face streaked with blood after his right ear was hit. A rally attendee was killed in the shooting, two others were wounded and the suspect is dead.</p>

<p><strong>KEY QUOTES</strong></p>

<p>"Americans demand and deserve answers from Director Cheatle about the attempted assassination of President Trump and the Secret Service's egregious failures," the Republican-led House oversight panel said on Wednesday, adding Cheatle agreed to comply with a subpoena issued by the committee's chair.</p>

<p>"The hearing will take place as scheduled on Monday, July 22," the panel added.</p>

<p><strong>CONTEXT</strong></p>

<p>Democratic U.S. President Joe Biden, who will face Republican Trump in November's election, said on Sunday he had ordered an independent review, and Republican lawmakers in Congress have also vowed swift investigations.</p>

<p>Cheatle said on Monday the Trump rally shooting was "unacceptable" and that she would not resign her post. Top Republicans in the U.S. Congress called on Wednesday for her to resign.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Florida man has been arrested for making threats against US President Joe Biden, just days after an assassination attempt on his Republican rival Donald Trump.</p>

<p>Jason Patrick Alday, 39, was arrested on Monday, the US Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Florida said.</p>

<p>Alday, of Quincy, Florida, allegedly "engaged in sending threatening communications, making threats against President Joe Biden and other federal officials," the office said in an announcement Wednesday.</p>

<p>According to the criminal complaint, Alday made threatening statements about Biden while being checked into a mental health facility in Tallahassee, Florida, last month.</p>

<p>He allegedly made further threats in posts on X.</p>

<p>Alday has been ordered detained pending trial.</p>

<p>Trump, 78, was wounded in the ear when a gunman opened fire during a campaign rally on Saturday in Butler, Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>A rally attendee was killed. The 20-year-old gunman, Thomas Matthew Crooks, was shot dead by Secret Service snipers.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden tested positive for Covid on Wednesday, shortly after conceding that he would consider dropping his troubled reelection bid if he was diagnosed with a serious medical condition.</p>

<p>The 81-year-old Democrat gave media the thumbs up from his limousine and said "I feel good" as he cut short a campaign trip to Las Vegas following the diagnosis.</p>

<p>The White House said he was suffering from a runny nose, cough and "general malaise," was taking Covid medication, and was flying straight to isolation at his beach house in Rehoboth, Delaware.</p>

<p>The diagnosis came hours after the release of comments by Biden in an interview conducted on Tuesday, in which he said he could step aside as a presidential candidate "if I had some medical condition that emerged."</p>

<p>It was also the latest development over a dramatic few days in the already frenetic and polarized White House race that saw his rival Donald Trump survive an assassination at a campaign rally of his own.</p>

<p>Biden has been fighting for political survival since a disastrous debate against Trump nearly three weeks ago, in which his tired and confused appearance sparked concerns about his age.</p>

<p>White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Biden had tested positive shortly after the first in a series of events in Las Vegas targeting crucial Latino voters.</p>

<p>"He is vaccinated and boosted and he is experiencing mild symptoms. He will be returning to Delaware where he will self-isolate and will continue to carry out all of his duties fully during that time," Jean-Pierre said.</p>

<p>Biden's doctor said he was suffering from a runny nose and a "non-productive cough" along with "general malaise," the White House said in an accompanying note.</p>

<p>He has received the Covid drug Paxlovid and has already taken his first dose, the statement read.</p>

<p>"His symptoms remain mild, his respiratory rate is normal at 16, his temperature is normal at 97.8 and his pulse oximetry is normal at 97 percent," it added.</p>

<p>- 'I feel good' -</p>

<p>Biden later leaned out of his limousine, dubbed the Beast, as he arrived at a Las Vegas airport to give the thumbs up.</p>

<p>"Good," he said to the press as he walked to Air Force One without a mask. "I feel good."</p>

<p>Janet Murguia, the president of the Unidos union for Latino workers, told the crowd about the diagnosis shortly before the White House announcement.</p>

<p>"I was just on the phone with President Biden, and he shared his deep disappointment at not being able to join us this afternoon," she said.</p>

<p>The furor over Biden's health is now set to go into overdrive, with a growing number of Democrats calling on him to step aside.</p>

<p>Asked what could make him rethink his presidential bid, Biden told the Black media outlet BET in an interview taped Tuesday in Las Vegas: "If I had some medical condition that emerged, if somebody, if the doctors came and said 'you've got this problem, that problem.'"</p>

<p>He suffered a major blow hours earlier on Wednesday when a top Democrat, Representative Adam Schiff of California, urged Biden to "pass the torch."</p>

<p>"A second Trump presidency will undermine the very foundation of our democracy, and I have serious concerns about whether the President can defeat Donald Trump in November," Schiff said in a statement to the Los Angeles Times.</p>

<p>Around 20 House Democrats and one senator have now called on Biden to leave the White House race.</p>

<p>Most polls show Biden trailing the election in a tight race with Trump.</p>

<p>Biden insists that Democratic voters support him, but a poll by the Associated Press and NORC Center for Public Affairs Research said Wednesday that nearly two-thirds want him to step aside.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[US President Joe Biden said he might re-evalute his election bid if a "medical condition" emerged, according to an extract of an interview released Wednesday, as his health faces scrutiny after a disastrous debate.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden said he could drop his reelection bid if doctors found he had a medical condition, as a top Democrat on Wednesday urged the 81-year-old to step aside.</p>

<p>Biden's comments were the first time he has even slightly opened the door to abandoning the White House race, and came as Representative Adam Schiff, a key ally from California, urged Biden to "pass the torch."</p>

<p>"If I had some medical condition that emerged, if somebody, if the doctors came and said 'you've got this problem, that problem,'" Biden told the Black media outlet BET in an interview taped Tuesday, when asked what could make him rethink.</p>

<p>Biden however defended his decision to stay on for a rematch with Republican Donald Trump in November, and explained why he had not handed over to a younger generation after one term.</p>

<p>"I said I was going to be a transitional candidate, and I thought I'd be able to move on from this, pass it on to someone else," he said. "But I didn't anticipate things getting so, so, so divided."</p>

<p>Biden has been fighting for political survival since a disastrous debate against Trump nearly three weeks ago, in which his tired and confused appearance sparked concerns about his age.</p>

<p>Schiff became the first Democrat to call for him to step aside since the assassination attempt against Trump on Saturday, which had briefly silenced the growing chorus against Biden.</p>

<p>"A second Trump presidency will undermine the very foundation of our democracy, and I have serious concerns about whether the President can defeat Donald Trump in November," Schiff said in a statement to the Los Angeles Times.</p>

<p>Schiff, who is expected to win a Senate seat this November, is a key White House ally in the legislature and shot to nationwide prominence as lead prosecutor during then-president Trump's first impeachment trial.</p>

<p>Biden was set to make a fresh attempt to prop up his candidacy in a speech to crucial Latino voters in the battleground state of Nevada later Wednesday.</p>

<p>- 'Pretty damn good' -</p>

<p>Around 20 House Democrats and one senator have now called on Biden to leave the White House race but Biden has refused, insisting he is best placed to beat Trump.</p>

<p>Most polls show Biden trailing in a tight race, with Trump pulling ahead in key swing states but no dramatic movement since the debate debacle or shooting.</p>

<p>Biden said his mental acuity was "pretty damn good" in an NBC interview on Monday, one of a series of unscripted outings aimed at showing he has what it takes.</p>

<p>With pressure on Biden mounting, Democrats said on Wednesday they plan a virtual nomination for the president in the first week of August, ahead of the Democratic National Convention (DNC) on August 19.</p>

<p>Some Democrats have slammed the scheme, accusing the party of trying to ram through Biden's candidacy and avoid a full discussion of alternative choices.</p>

<p>Party chiefs say they need to carry out the virtual roll-call by August 7, which is the deadline set by the Republican-led state of Ohio for the submission of nominations.</p>

<p>Biden otherwise risks not being on the ballot in Ohio, the home state of Trump's new running mate J.D. Vance.</p>

<p>While Ohio's governor has signed a law giving Biden more time, the DNC said it feared further legal challenges.</p>

<p>"None of this will be rushed," the heads of the DNC's rules committee said in a letter to lawmakers obtained by AFP. "No matter what may be reported, our goal is not to fast-track."</p>

<p>But several lawmakers are planning to sign a letter against the virtual nomination plan and others have criticized it, according to US media.</p>

<p>Biden insists that Democratic voters support him, but a poll by the Associated Press and NORC Center for Public Affairs Research said Wednesday that nearly two-thirds want him to step aside.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russia is prepared to work with any US president who is open to dialogue, its foreign minister said Wednesday.</p>

<p>"We will work with any American leader, we will remain ready to work with any US leader that the US people elect, and who will be willing to engage in equitable, mutually respectful dialogue," Sergei Lavrov said at a UN press briefing.</p>

<p>He was answering a question about relations between Moscow and Washington if Donald Trump is reelected in November and defeats President Joe Biden.</p>

<p>Trump, the Republican candidate, said in May 2023 that he could end the war in Ukraine "in 24 hours" if he returns to the White House.</p>

<p>Trump is regularly attacked by Democrats as being too soft on Russia. He has often spoken admiringly of President Vladimir Putin, who has been charged with war crimes over the invasion of Ukraine.</p>

<p>"We worked with President Trump," Lavrov said.</p>

<p>He said US sanctions were repeatedly imposed on Moscow while Trump was in power. However, "at that time dialogue was under way between us and Washington at the highest levels. Right now, there is no such dialogue."</p>

<p>Asked about Trump's running mate, Senator J.D. Vance, a fierce opponent of US aid to Ukraine, Lavrov praised his position.</p>

<p>"He's in favor of peace, in favor of ending the assistance that's been provided, and we can only welcome that, because that's what we need -- to stop pumping Ukraine full of weapons and then the war will end," he said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Unless a miracle happens for Democrats, Donald Trump is set to be the 47th President of the United States of America, a beaming Shalabh Kumar, a close aide of Trump, told NDTV.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Unless a miracle happens for Democrats, Donald Trump is set to be the 47th President of the United States of America, a beaming Shalabh Kumar, a close aide of Trump, told NDTV. The Chicago businessman underlined that the failed assassination attempt means it is game, set, match for Trump in the November election.</p>

<p>"This particular event, the assassination attempt, has practically sealed the election campaign. It is almost over. It is very challenging at this point for Democrats to figure out what to do. Such a contrast has been laid out in the minds of the electorate. Two weeks prior to this, you had this debate between Trump and Biden where everybody recognises, including president Biden, that it was really a bad night for him. He just seemed to be lost. He didn't seem to be anywhere; could not answer any question. Sleepy Joe as he has been known," said Mr Kumar, Chairman of the Republican Hindu Coalition.</p>

<p>"In contrast to that we have a man of steel, a fighter. Doesn't look like a 78-year-old. After getting shot in his right ear, if he had been looking straight it would have gone straight to his head. He gets up and has this fighting spirit, says fight, fight, fight. That's what Americans like to see in their presidents. As it stands right now, unless the Democrats come up with a different candidate, they still have a month to go, this election is over," said the prominent Indian-American businessman.</p>

<p>Pressed to answer if there is a rethink on the presidential candidate on the Democratic side, he said he is hoping for a last-minute change to make for an exciting contest. They still have a month to decide, he said.</p>

<p>"I am still betting on President Barack Obama convincing his wife Michelle Obama to step in at the last minute. Then there would be a real contest. I would probably say then between Trump and Michelle Obama there will be a contest. Between Trump and Joe Biden there is no contest. Between Trump and Kamala Harris there is no contest. Behind the scenes, everybody wishes on the Democrat part that Michelle Obama is persuaded to become the Democrat nominee. A good contest is always a good thing," said the man, who was involved in the Ronald Reagan re-election campaign in 1984.</p>

<p>"They have to come up with something different. I am hoping Obama convinces Michelle to step up. Then there will be a real contest. They have to find somebody else," said the businessman.</p>

<p>Asked how the fundraising is coming along post the assassination attempt, Mr Kumar said it has seen a dramatic increase.</p>

<p>"Money is going like crazy. Donor class is seeing that the DJT (Donald John Trump) is coming back as the 47th president. Am sure you are aware of what Elon Musk has done. $45 million a month till the election. Peter Thiel. Big time people are coming forward and funding the campaign. Money raising has increased dramatically after the assassination attempt," said the businessman who is not just a financial backer but is on the ground getting people out to vote as Trump limbers for a second showdown with Joe Biden.</p>

<p>Donald Trump won the formal nomination Monday as the Republican presidential candidate and picked a right-wing loyalist, JD Vance, for his running mate, kicking off a triumphalist party convention in the wake of the weekend's failed assassination attempt.</p>

<p>"We have 6 million Hindu Americans in the country, out of that 3.3 million are registered voters. Hindu Americans, Indian Americans, they like to declare themselves independent. They go back and forth. 2008, 2012 they were majorly for the Democrat. And 2016 we changed that significantly, especially in the battleground states. Then in 2020, they shifted back to Democrats. Maybe they are fence-sitters. Hindu Americans, they decide practically at the last minute who they are going to vote for. Maybe on the day of the election itself. They are not committed to any particular party," he said.</p>

<p>The 78-year-old former president was injured but survived the assassination attempt, a brazen attack that shocked a nation already deeply polarized ahead of the November election.</p>

<p>"The country is divided. However, even before the debate, particularly after the debate, the country was pulling towards Trump," he said.</p>

<p>Trump was speaking when multiple bangs rang out. He clutched his ear, with blood visible on his ear and cheek, then ducked to the floor as Secret Service agents swarmed onto the podium, surrounding him and rushing him to a nearby vehicle.</p>

<p>Iconic images of a bloodied Trump waving his fist after the shooting are already galvanizing Republican hopes that voters will further rally behind him for a landslide victory in November.</p>

<p>"The campaign after the assassination attempt has become a different campaign. It's altogether different. The enthusiasm in the delegates and people on the ground, the MAGA crowd, the enthusiasm is through the roof. As everybody can sense that at this point in time, unless a miracle happens for Democrats, he is the 47th president of the US and we are all very happy about it," he stressed.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Indian-origin Republican leader Vivek Ramaswamy, during the Republican National Convention, stressed the 'American Dream' and called on people to shed all forms of fear and be free to speak up their minds.</p>

<p>He said that this 'American Dream' won US the American Revolution, two world wars, and the Cold War, and if that can be revived again, not a nation, not a virus, or China can defeat the US.</p>

<p>He was addressing the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on Tuesday night.</p>

<p>"Fear has been infectious in this country. But courage can be contagious, too. That, too, is what it means to be an American...If you're at home and you disagree with everything I just said, our message to you is this: We will still defend to the death your right to say it, because that is who we are as Americans," said the GOP leader, who dropped out of the presidential race earlier this year.</p>

<p>"We are the country where we can disagree like hell and still get together at the dinner table at the end of it. That is the America I know. That is the America we miss," he added.</p>

<p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk also reacted on Mr Ramaswamy's remarks.</p>

<p>"Well said!!" Mr Musk posted on his X handle.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Well said!!<a href="https://t.co/CgKPa1rnnt">pic.twitter.com/CgKPa1rnnt</a></p>
— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1813388983109357933?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 17, 2024</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Further stating "We don't need to be a nation in decline," Mr Ramaswamy asserted that US can still be a nation in ascent, and whose best days are still ahead of it.</p>

<p>Elaborating on it further, he said that in US, people, irrespective of their identity, surname, can get ahead with their commitment, dedication and hard work.</p>

<p>"That country where, no matter who you are, where your parents came from or what your skin colour is, or how long your last name is, you will still get ahead in this country with your own hard work, your own commitment, your own dedication, and that you know what? You are free to speak your mind at every step of the way," Mr Ramaswamy said.</p>

<p>The Indian-origin leader further said that this "American exceptionalism" will be revived when Donald Trump returns to the White House.</p>

<p>"That is the American dream. That is what won us the American Revolution. That is what reunited us after the civilizational war. That is what won us two world wars and the Cold War. That is what still gives hope to the free world," Mr Ramaswamy said.</p>

<p>He added, "And if we can revive that dream over group identity, victimhood, and grievance, then nobody in the world, not a nation, not a corporation, not a virus, not China, is going to defeat us. That is what American exceptionalism is all about. And that is what we will revive this November when we send Donald J. Trump back to the White House."</p>

<p>Earlier in the day, the 38-year-old said that illegal immigrants will be 'returned' to the country of their origin.</p>

<p>"Our message to illegal immigrants is also this; we will return you to your country of origin. Not because you're all bad people, but because you broke the law, and the United States of America was founded on the rule of law," he stated.</p>

<p>Mr Ramaswamy added that he would seal the southern border on the first day if they came to power.</p>

<p>Addressing black Americans, he said, "The media has tried to convince you for decades that Republicans don't care about your communities. We want for you what we want for every American: safe neighborhoods, clean streets, good jobs, a better life for your children, and a justice system that treats everyone equally - regardless of your skin colour or your political beliefs."</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US Department of Homeland Security's inspector general said Wednesday that it is investigating the Secret Service's handling of security at the campaign rally where a gunman tried to assassinate former president Donald Trump.</p>

<p>The office of DHS inspector general Joseph Cuffari said in an online posting that the probe is intended to "evaluate the United States Secret Service's process for securing" the campaign event.</p>

<p>The Secret Service has faced intense scrutiny since Saturday's shooting in Butler, Pennsylvania, during which a gunman opened fire on the Republican presidential candidate from an exposed rooftop some 150 yards (meters) away from the stage where Trump was speaking.</p>

<p>Trump was wounded in the ear and a rally attendee was killed. The 20-year-old gunman, Thomas Matthew Crooks, was shot dead by Secret Service snipers.</p>

<p>President Joe Biden has ordered an independent review of the Secret Service's handling of the assassination attempt, which is also being investigated by the FBI as a case of potential domestic terrorism.</p>

<p>Members of the House of Representatives and Senate are to receive briefings from the Secret Service, the Justice Department and the FBI later Wednesday on the status of the various probes, according to US media reports.</p>

<p>The House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday announced plans to hold a hearing on July 24 into the FBI's investigation into the assassination attempt and Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson told Fox News he would seek the resignation of Secret Service director Kimberly Cheatle.</p>

<p>Cheatle is scheduled to appear before the House Committee on Oversight and Accountability on Monday for a hearing into the assassination attempt.</p>

<p>The Secret Service is responsible for the safety of the president, vice president and former presidents, and their families, as well as major election candidates and visiting foreign heads of state.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russia and Ukraine have released a total of 190 captured soldiers in the latest prisoner exchange between the two sides, officials in Moscow and Kyiv announced Wednesday.</p>

<p>Thousands of POWs have been freed in more than 50 individual exchanges throughout the war -- an area where the two sides have been able to strike rare agreements since Russia invaded in February 2022.</p>

<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Russia's defence ministry each said Wednesday that 95 of their soldiers had been freed.</p>

<p>"We continue to bring our people home. Another 95 defenders have been released from Russian captivity," Zelensky said in a post on Telegram.</p>

<p>He said the exchange was mediated by the United Arab Emirates.</p>

<p>"As a result of a negotiation process, 95 Russian servicemen... have been returned," Russia's defence ministry said on Telegram.</p>

<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin said in June that 1,348 Russian soldiers were being held in Ukrainian captivity, and that Russia had detained 6,465 Ukrainian POWs.</p>

<p>Exchanges have taken place sporadically throughout the conflict.</p>

<p>In a rare instance of direct talks between officials from Moscow and Kyiv, Russian Human Rights Commissioner Tatyana Moskalkova said her office met with a counterpart from Ukraine at the exchange.</p>

<p>The first such meeting took place at an exchange in June, Ukraine's human rights commissioner Dmytro Lubinets told AFP at the time.</p>

<p>The officials discussed "joint humanitarian actions, including those related to the reunification of families," Moskalkova said.</p>

<p>Kyiv accuses Russia of having forcibly deported thousands of Ukrainian children from territory which came under Moscow's control, and is working to secure their return.</p>

<p>Moscow says children were moved for their own protection.</p>

<p>Several have been returned, including through deals brokered by Qatar.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An assisted dying group expects a new portable suicide pod to be used for the first time in Switzerland potentially within months to provide death without medical supervision, they said Wednesday.</p>

<p>The space-age-looking Sarco capsule first unveiled in 2019 replaces the oxygen inside of it with nitrogen, causing death by hypoxia.</p>

<p>The recently-formed organisation The Last Resort said it saw no legal obstacle to its use in Switzerland, where the law generally allows assisted suicide if the person commits the lethal act themselves.</p>

<p>"Since we have people indeed queuing up, asking to use the Sarco, it's very likely that it will take place pretty soon. But it's all I can say," Last Resort's chief executive Florian Willet told a press conference.</p>

<p>"I cannot imagine a more beautiful way (to die), of breathing air without oxygen until falling into an eternal sleep," he added.</p>

<p>The person wishing to die must first pass a psychiatric assessment of their mental capacity -- a key legal requirement.</p>

<p>The person climbs into the capsule, closes the lid, and is asked automated questions such as who they are, where they are and if they know what happens when they press the button.</p>

<p>"'If you want to die', the voice says in the processor, 'Press this button'," said euthanasia campaigner and Sarco inventor Philip Nitschke.</p>

<p>He said that once the button is pressed, the amount of oxygen in the air plummets from 21 percent to 0.05 percent in less than 30 seconds.</p>

<p>"They will then stay in that state of unconsciousness for... around about five minutes before death will take place," he added.</p>

<p><strong>No way back</strong></p>

<p>As for someone changing their mind at the very last minute, Nitschke said: "Once you press that button, there's no way of going back."</p>

<p>No decision has been made over the time, date and place of the first death, or who the first user might be.</p>

<p>Such details would not be made public until after the event because "we really don't want a person's desire for a peaceful passing Switzerland to turn into a media circus", said lawyer Fiona Stewart, who is on The Last Resort's advisory board.</p>

<p>Asked if the first use would be this year, she replied: "I would say yes".</p>

<p>She said the only cost for the user would be 18 Swiss francs ($20) for the nitrogen.</p>

<p>But the capsule's potential use has raised a host of legal and ethical questions in Switzerland, reigniting debate on assisted dying.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p><p><div class='table-div suicide'><table class='table'><thead><tr><th colspan='2'>Helplines</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Vandrevala Foundation for Mental Health</td><td><a href='tel:+919999666555'>9999666555</a> or <a href='mailto:help@vandrevalafoundation.com'>help@vandrevalafoundation.com</a> </td></tr><tr><td>TISS iCall</td><td><a href='tel:+912225521111'>022-25521111</a> (Monday-Saturday: 8 am to 10 pm)</td></tr> <tr><td colspan='2'>(If you need support or know someone who does, please reach out to your nearest mental health specialist.)</td></tr></tbody></table></div></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p>

<p>The UK government on Wednesday announced plans to axe 92 House of Lords seats retained for hereditary lawmakers, resurrecting reform of the unelected chamber started under Tony Blair's Labour government in the 1990s.</p>

<p>King Charles III, opening the first parliamentary session after Keir Starmer's general election win for Labour, said removing the peers' right to sit and vote in the Lords was part of "measures to modernise" Britain's uncodified constitution.</p>

<p>Labour won the July 4 election by a landslide, returning it to power for the first time since 2010, allowing it to put its manifesto pledges into law, including the much-touted Lords reforms.</p>

<p>Parliament's unelected upper chamber has long been subject to demands for reform to make it more representative and less "a chamber festering with grotesques and has-beens", as one newspaper columnist famously described it in 2022.</p>

<p>But the extent of Labour's plans remain unclear.</p>

<p>The scrapping of the hereditary peers -- the hundreds of members of the aristocracy whose titles are inherited -- has been described as a "first step in wider reform".</p>

<p>"The continued presence of hereditary peers in the House of Lords is outdated and indefensible," the government said in briefing notes accompanying the King's Speech.</p>

<p><strong>Removing hereditary seats</strong></p>

<p>Comprising around 800 lawmakers, the House of Lords is comfortably larger than any other equivalent in a democracy.</p>

<p>Its members, whose current average age is 71, are mostly appointed for life.</p>

<p>They include former MPs, typically appointed by departing prime ministers, along with people nominated after serving in prominent public- or private-sector roles, and Church of England clerics.</p>

<p>The primary role of the centuries-old chamber is to scrutinise the government.</p>

<p>It cannot override legislation sent from the popularly elected House of Commons, but it can amend and delay bills and initiate new draft laws.</p>

<p>That job occasionally propels the Lords into the political spotlight, such as during its recent delays to the previous Conservative government's contentious Rwanda deportation plan -- quickly scrapped by the new government.</p>

<p>Like the Commons, the Lords has specialised scrutiny committees.</p>

<p>The new government's planned legislation revisits the House of Lords reform agenda that Blair's Labour government initiated in the late 1990s.</p>

<p>His government had intended to abolish all the seats held by hundreds of hereditary members who sat in the chamber at that time.</p>

<p>But it ended up retaining 92 in what was supposed to be a temporary compromise.</p>

<p>"25 years later, they form part of the status quo more by accident than by design," said the briefing from Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government.</p>

<p>"No other modern comparable democracies allow individuals to sit and vote in their legislature by right of birth," it added.</p>

<p>"Holding membership of a seat within a Parliament on a hereditary basis is incredibly rare."</p>

<p><strong>'Overdue and essential'</strong></p>

<p>The government said the reforms were in part motivated by the gender imbalance of hereditary peers -- currently all male, because most peerages can only be passed down the male line.</p>

<p>The rest of the House of Lords fares better, with 242 of other members -- 36 percent -- female.</p>

<p>Starmer's new administration also argues that hereditary peers are too politically "static" for a democracy.</p>

<p>Of the 92 seats allotted for them under the 1999 reforms, 42 are for Conservatives, 28 for so-called crossbenchers, three for the Liberal Democrats and just two for Labour.</p>

<p>Meanwhile 15 are elected by the entire chamber from the hundreds of hereditary peers that exist in the UK.</p>

<p>Reformers also argue that hereditary peers do not face propriety checks, compared to life peers who are subject to a vetting procedure from the House of Lords Appointment Committee.</p>

<p>"In the 21st century, there should not be almost 100 places reserved for individuals who were born into certain families, nor should there be seats effectively reserved only for men," the government argued</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Several cities across Ukraine were recording historic scorching temperatures, officials said Wednesday, at a time when major urban hubs are suffering long periods without electricity after Russian attacks on power plants.</p>

<p>In the capital Kyiv, Ukrainians have been seeking respite from oppressive heat by swimming in the Dnipro river that cuts through the city, where some districts have been without power for hours at a time due to electricity rationing.</p>

<p>"This is the hottest summer of my life," said 22-year-old Dmytro, who complained he had no electricity for about 20 hours a day.</p>

<p>Another resident, 18-year-old Diana, told AFP the temperature in her workplace was unbearable.</p>

<p>"Air conditioners don't run at work when there is no power. This is how we are living," she said.</p>

<p>A state meteorological station covering the Kyiv region said Wednesday that air temperatures one day earlier reached 36 degrees Celsius, beating by 0.2C a previous record for the same date set in 1931.</p>

<p>The Ukrainian Hydrometeorological Center said historic records were set in Vinnytsia, Chernivtsi and Mykolaiv -- cities in the centre and south of Ukraine.</p>

<p>The records come as the energy ministry has stepped up imports of electricity from European countries and imposed strict rationing due to Russian attacks that have halved Ukraine's electricity generation capacity, compared to one year ago.</p>

<p>The ministry said Wednesday that with temperatures at their "maximum", there would be rolling power outages across the country.</p>

<p>Electricity consumption is "also expected to reach a record level which significantly exceeds the capacity of Ukrainian power plants", the ministry explained in a statement.</p>

<p>Last month, Kyiv urged officials to turn off air conditioners in government buildings and called on regional authorities to limit street lighting to ease pressure on the grid.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A fire at a shopping centre in southwestern China killed at least six people on Wednesday, state media reported, with 30 others rescued from the blaze.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A fire that tore through a shopping centre in southwestern China has killed 16 people, state media reported Thursday.</p>

<p>Rescue operations concluded at around 3:00 am on Thursday (1900 GMT Wednesday), according to the local fire and rescue services cited by state news agency Xinhua.</p>

<p>Video broadcast by state media CCTV and shared on social media Wednesday night showed thick black smoke billowing out of the 14-storey tower in Zigong, Sichuan province.</p>

<p>The blaze started in the early evening in a shopping centre at the foot of the building, the channel said.</p>

<p>Around 30 people were rescued from the complex, with the fire extinguished by rescuers around 8:20 pm on Wednesday, CCTV said.</p>

<p>Later footage provided by a drone operator to AFP showed firetrucks and other first responders blocking off the road late at night, continuing to spray down the charred building.</p>

<p>As of 3:00 am Thursday, the death toll stood at 16 with no individuals left trapped inside, according to Xinhua.</p>

<p>Zigong's emergency services department received news about the fire at around 6:10 pm and immediately dispatched firefighters to extinguish the blaze, the broadcaster said.</p>

<p>Other images shared on social media -- which AFP could not immediately verify -- show people gathered in front of the burning building.</p>

<p>The emergency department has called on the public to "not to believe or amplify rumours" about the fire.</p>

<p>Zigong, around 1,900 kilometres (1,200 miles) from the capital Beijing, is home to nearly 2.5 million people.</p>

<p><strong>- Lax safety -</strong></p>

<p>Fires are common in China due to lax safety standards and poor enforcement.</p>

<p>In January, dozens died after a fire broke out at a store in the central city of Xinyu, with Xinhua reporting the blaze had been caused by the "illegal" use of fire by workers in the store's basement.</p>

<p>The same month, a fire in a residential building killed at least 15 people.</p>

<p>That fire came just days after a late-evening blaze at a school in central China's Henan province killed 13 children as they slept in a dormitory.</p>

<p>In June last year, an explosion at a barbecue restaurant in the northwest of the country left 31 dead and prompted official pledges of a nationwide campaign to promote workplace safety.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal met UK Secretary of State for Business and Trade Jonathan Reynolds in Italy and discussed plans to take forward the negotiations on the proposed free trade agreement, an official statement said on Wednesday.</p>

<p>The bilateral meeting took place on the sidelines of the G7 Trade Ministers' meeting at Reggio Calabria, Italy.</p>

<p>The India-UK talks for the proposed free trade agreement (FTA) began in January 2022. The 14th round of talks stalled as the two nations stepped into their general election cycles.</p>

<p>"Mr Goyal congratulated Mr. Jonathan Reynolds on his appointment and discussed deepening bilateral economic relations. The conversation included plans to take forward the discussions on FTA between India and the UK," the commerce ministry said.</p>

<p>In an FTA, two or more trading partners either significantly reduce or eliminate customs duties on the maximum number of goods traded between them. Besides, they also ease norms to promote and facilitate trade in services and investments.</p>

<p>There are pending issues in both goods and services sectors.</p>

<p>The Indian industry is demanding greater access for its skilled professionals from sectors like IT and healthcare in the UK market, besides market access for several goods at nil customs duty.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the UK is seeking a significant cut in import duties on goods such as scotch whiskey, electric vehicles, lamb meat, chocolates and certain confectionary items.</p>

<p>Britain is also looking for more opportunities for UK services in Indian markets in segments like telecommunications, legal and financial services (banking and insurance).</p>

<p>The two countries are also negotiating a bilateral investment treaty (BIT). There are 26 chapters in the agreement, which include goods, services, investments and intellectual property rights.</p>

<p>The bilateral trade between India and the UK increased to USD 21.34 billion in 2023-24 from USD 20.36 billion in 2022-23.</p>

<p>The Labour Party's election manifesto for the recent polls also committed to clinching the deal.</p>

<p>Mr Goyal also holds meetings with other counterparts at the G7 Trade Ministers' meeting.</p>

<p>"Discussions with Valdis Dombrovskis, Executive Vice President of the European Commission focused on promoting India-EU trade and economic collaborations, including ongoing FTA negotiations," it said.</p>

<p>During his meeting with New Zealand's Trade Minister Todd McClay, both ministers explored opportunities to enhance bilateral trade and investment ties for mutual growth.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A fire that broke out Wednesday in a shopping centre in southwestern China was extinguished but some people were still trapped inside, state broadcaster CCTV said.</p>

<p>Footage broadcast by the channel and shared on social media showed thick black smoke rising from a building in the city.</p>

<p>About 17 people were rescued from the building in the city of Zigong in Sichuan province, the channel said.</p>

<p>"By 8:20 pm (1220 GMT), the fire had been extinguished," CCTV said, adding "some people are still trapped and rescue operations are continuing".</p>

<p>The fire started in the early evening in a shopping centre at the foot of a 14-storey building, the channel said.</p>

<p>Fires and other deadly accidents are common in China due to lax safety standards and poor enforcement.</p>

<p>In January, dozens died after a fire broke out at a store in the central city of Xinyu, with state news agency Xinhua reporting the blaze had been caused by the "illegal" use of fire by workers in the store's basement.</p>

<p>That fire came just days after a late-evening blaze at a school in central China's Henan province killed 13 schoolchildren as they slept in a dormitory.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a shocking incident, a woman weighing 150 kilograms (350 pounds) from the United States, was charged with reckless homicide after she sat on her 10-year-old foster son for several minutes and suffocated him, as per a report in the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/07/17/us-news/indiana-woman-arrested-after-sitting-on-10-year-old-foster-son-who-died-2-days-later/"><em>New York Post.</em></a></p>

<p>48-year-old Jennifer Lee Wilson killed Dakota Levi Stevens, who weighed 40 kilograms (90 pounds) in April when he attempted to escape to a neighbour's house. According to court documents, the foster mother is now accused of sitting on the youngster outside her house in an attempt to stop him from "acting up."</p>

<p>According to the documents, she reported to the police that Stevens had thrown himself to the ground at her house and that she had "laid on his midsection and called his caseworker." Wilson continued by saying that she lay on him for about five minutes, at which point he stopped moving. Notably, she thought he was lying.</p>

<p>"Wilson stated that when she attempted to stop him from leaving, she does not know if she tackled Dakota or they fell to the ground however her intention was to hold him," the court filing stated.</p>

<p>As per the 20-second doorbell footage, Wilson was seen laying on Stevens near his "neck/head area". In another clip, the woman was seen laying near his buttock area and the boy is seen not moving during the entire duration of the six-minute clip, according to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://fox8.com/news/foster-mom-accused-of-killing-10-year-old-indiana-boy-by-laying-on-him-warrant-issued/"><em>Fox News.</em></a></p>

<p>With significant trauma, Stevens was transported to a South Bend hospital. On April 27 morning, he was declared dead. Steven's death was declared a homicide due to mechanical asphyxia.</p>

<p>A neighbour told police that 30 minutes before the incident, Stevens ran to her house and asked if she could adopt him. According to documents, he was allegedly struck in the face and was prevented from calling his case worker by his foster parents.</p>

<p>On Saturday, Wilson was taken into custody. If found guilty of reckless homicide, she could spend up to six years in prison. She no longer looks after children, and her foster care license was cancelled.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Twenty-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks from Bethel Park, Pennsylvania, shot at former US President Donald Trump with an AR-15 rifle at a rally in Butler on July 13. The 20-year-old was shot dead by US Secret Service snipers after the attack.</p>

<p>Crooks was a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/trump-rally-shooter-thomas-matthew-crooks-was-a-maths-whiz-at-school-had-won-500-prize-6103124">maths and science whiz </a>at school. Described as 'quiet' by his former schoolmates, he often kept to himself. Crooks was "bullied, he was just bullied so much," <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/trump-rally-shooter-thomas-matthew-crooks-was-quiet-lonely-and-bullied-in-school-report-6106636">Jason Kohler</a>, who attended the same school as the shooter said.</p>

<p>An undated video is being shared on X, showing Thomas Matthew Crooks getting bullied by his classmates. Crooks, who is on his desk, is allegedly bullied by his classmate, who is forcefully pulling his pants.</p>

<p><strong>NDTV could not independently verify the authenticity of the video.</strong></p>

<p>The Trump shooter pulled back his leg, trying to stop his classmate from bullying him.</p>

<p>AFP reported, quoting Mr Kohler, that Crooks had been made fun of for the way he dressed, noting that he would sometimes wear hunting outfits. He was "lonely" and often seemed "socially reserved".</p>

<p>"He was super smart. That's what really kind of threw me off was, this was, like, a smart kid, like he excelled," another classmate said. "Nothing crazy ever came up in any conversation."</p>

<p>Thomas Crooks graduated in 2022 from Bethel Park High School, according to the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review. He received a $500 "star award" from the National Math and Science Initiative, according to the newspaper.</p>

<p>A 2022 graduation ceremony video cited by the New York Times shows Crooks receiving his high school diploma to some applause. Video from that ceremony posted online shows Crooks with glasses in a black graduation gown and posing with a school official.</p>

<p><strong>'He acted alone'</strong></p>

<p>The FBI said on July 14 that Crooks' social media profile does not contain threatening language, nor have they found any history of mental health issues. They said he acted alone and had not identified a motive.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/something-triggered-that-what-trump-attackers-former-teacher-said-6107846">Crooks was employed as a dietary aide </a>at a nursing home at the time of the shooting, the home's administrator said in a statement.</p>

The next morning, Crooks went to the Home Depot to buy a five-foot ladder. He then bought 50 rounds of ammunition from a gun store, the report said.</p>

<p>Sources say he used the same ladder to climb the building from where he opened fire at the 78-year-old Republican nominee.</p>]]></content:encoded>

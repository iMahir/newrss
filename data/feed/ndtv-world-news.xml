       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A large crowd gathered outside the Houses of Parliament in London on Saturday to protest the alleged violence against minority Hindus and other groups in Bangladesh following the resignation and departure of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina earlier this week.</p>

<p>Protesters carried Bangladeshi flags and held posters with messages such as "Protect our temples in Bangladesh," "Hindu lives matter," and "We want justice."</p>

<p>They chanted slogans demanding peace and equality amidst the recent surge in violence.</p>

<p>The demonstration included activists from various human rights organizations, members of the Bangladeshi diaspora, and Indian-American Hindu allies standing in solidarity with Bangladesh's Hindu community.</p>

<p>Unadi, a protester from Bangladesh, expressed concern over the helplessness of Bangladeshi Hindus, saying that the majority population prevents them from speaking out against injustices.</p>

<p>"Our country became independent in 1971 so that all communities could live peacefully. But now, we are suffering from atrocities committed by the majority community," Unadi said.</p>

<p>He compared the situation in Bangladesh to other countries, noting that while governments around the world protect their minorities, the opposite is true in Bangladesh, forcing many to flee the country.</p>

<p>"The mentality of the people has to change so that we can live peacefully. In modern times like these, all communities must learn to coexist peacefully. We are all equals," he added.</p>

<p>A protester from the Bengali Christian Association in the UK highlighted the need for equal treatment of all communities.</p>

<p>"I demand the interim government to amend the constitution, as it currently states that Bangladesh is a Muslim country. However, all communities fought for Bangladesh's independence, so the country belongs to everyone," she said.</p>

<p>Another protester pointed out that Bangladeshi minorities are being forced to flee due to ongoing atrocities by the majority community.</p>

<p>"We are gathered here because, for the past five to six days, people in Bangladesh have been torturing and burning our houses. They cannot take our country from us, and they cannot deport us. We want to live safely and peacefully in our country. The violence against minorities must stop," he said.</p>

<p>Another protester shared that his home in Bangladesh had been looted and set on fire just days ago.</p>

<p>"My house was burned. A few days ago, many people looted our house," he said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<h3><strong>Bangladesh's Interim Leader On Attacks On Hindus</strong></h3>

<p>Bangladesh's interim leader <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/bangladeshs-interim-leader-muhammad-yunus-condemns-heinous-attacks-on-minorities-6309380" target="_blank">Muhammad Yunus</a> on Saturday condemned attacks on the minority communities in the violence-hit nation, terming them as "heinous".</p>

<p>Mr Yunus, a Nobel laureate, also urged the students, who are at the forefront of the protests, to protect all Hindu, Christian, and Buddhist families from harm.</p>

<p>"Are they not the people of this country? You have been able to save the country; can't you save some families?... You must say - no one can harm them. They are my brothers; we fought together, and we will stay together," the 84-year-old asserted, underscoring the need for national unity.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Bangladesh still stares at uncertainty. Top government offices are lying empty in the country that now has a caretaker government and reports of persecution of minority communities continue to pour in.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<ol>
	<li>A caretaker government led by Nobel winner Muhammad Yunus has been sworn in to steer the country through these tumultuous times, but it's yet to make its presence feel in a country marred by protests.</li>
	<li>Yunus, the interim caretaker backed by the military, called for calm during his visit to Rangpur yesterday as he embraced the mother of a student shot dead by the cops. He has also appealed for religious unity amid reports of attacks on the minorities in Bangladesh since the ouster of Sheikh Hasina.</li>
	<li>The latest in the string of resignations is of the country's central bank chief. Bangladesh Bank Governor Abdur Rouf stepped down yesterday, three days after over 100 bank officials staged protests outside his office, demanding his resignation. Rouf has cited health reasons for stepping down, reported The Daily Star.</li>
	<li>Chief Justice Obaidul Hassan, seen as a loyalist of ousted premier Sheikh Hasina, was forced out of his office yesterday as students surrounded the Bangladesh Supreme Court and gave him an hour's ultimatum to step down. Five more judges of the top court resigned later in the day.</li>
	<li>Justice Syed Refat Ahmed, the seniormost judge of the High Court division of the Supreme Court, was appointed the country's 25th Chief Justice by President Mohammed Shahabuddin last evening.</li>
	<li>The chief of the country's market regulator has also resigned. Prof Shibli Rubayat-Ul Islam, the chairman of Bangladesh Securities and Exchange Commission, had not been turning up at work for several days. He, too, cited health reasons for stepping down.</li>
	<li>Meanwhile, attacks on minorities, especially Hindus, in Bangladesh has raised concerns. Chittagong city saw a massive rally yesterday, attended by tens of thousands of Hindus, demanding safety and equal rights as citizens of the country.</li>
	<li>Incidents of violence, too, continue to be reported from across Bangladesh. Five army personnel were injured and a military vehicle was torched during a clash at an Awami League procession in Gopalganj last afternoon.</li>
	<li>Bangladesh has reported arson, killings and multiple incidents of persecution of minority communities across 52 districts since Sheikh Hasina's resignation as the Prime Minister on August 5. Two protesters also suffered injuries.</li>
	<li>Ms Hasina fled the country the same day amid fears of being mobbed after protests intensified following the death of over 400 agitators in clashes with the cops. Her residence was stormed by the protesters hours after she left the complex in a military helicopter. She landed at an airbase in Uttar Pradesh, hours later.</li>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thousands of anti-racism demonstrators rallied across the UK on Saturday to protest recent rioting blamed on the far-right in the wake of the Southport knife attack that killed three children.</p>

<p>Crowds massed in London, Glasgow in Scotland, Belfast in Northern Ireland, Manchester and numerous other English towns and cities, as fears of violent confrontations with anti-immigration agitators failed to materialise.</p>

<p>It followed similar developments on Wednesday night when anticipated far-right rallies up and down the country failed to materialise. Instead, people turned out for gatherings organised by the Stand Up To Racism advocacy group.</p>

<p>Up until that point, more than a dozen English towns and cities -- and Belfast too -- had been hit by anti-migrant unrest, following the deadly July 29 stabbings which were falsely linked on social media to a Muslim immigrant.</p>

<p>Rioters targeted mosques and hotels linked to immigration, as well as police, vehicles and other sites.</p>

<p>Recent nights have been largely peaceful in English towns and cities, prompting hope among the authorities that the nearly 800 arrests and numerous people already jailed had deterred further violence.</p>

<p>Despite the respite, UK media reported Saturday that Prime Minister Keir Starmer had cancelled plans to go on holiday next week to remain focused on the crisis.</p>

<h3><strong>&nbsp;'No to racism'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>In Northern Ireland, which has seen sustained disorder since last weekend, police said they were investigating a suspected racially motivated hate crime overnight.</p>

<p>A petrol bomb was thrown at a mosque in Newtownards, east of Belfast, early Saturday, with racist graffiti sprayed on the building, said the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI).</p>

<p>The petrol bomb thrown at the property had failed to ignite, it added.</p>

<p>"This is being treated as a racially motivated hate crime, and I want to send a strong message to those who carried this out, that this type of activity will not be tolerated," PSNI Chief Inspector Keith Hutchinson said.</p>

<p>Overnight, there were also reports of damage to property and vehicles in Belfast, as nightly unrest there rumbled on.</p>

<p>While the disturbances in Northern Ireland were sparked by events in England, they have also been fuelled by pro-UK loyalist paramilitaries with their own agenda, according to the PSNI.</p>

<p>Around 5,000 anti-racism demonstrators rallied in Belfast on Saturday "largely without incident", police said.</p>

<p>Fiona Doran, of the United Against Racism group which co-organised the gathering, said it showed "that Belfast is a welcoming city... that says no to racism, to fascism, to islamophobia, to antisemitism, or misogyny".</p>

<h3><strong>&nbsp;'Delivering justice'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>In London, thousands massed outside the office of Brexit architect Nigel Farage's Reform UK party before marching through the city centre, accompanied by a large police presence.</p>

<p>They blame Farage and other far-right figures for helping to fuel the riots through anti-immigrant rhetoric and conspiracy theories.</p>

<p>"It's really important for people of colour in this country, for immigrants in this country, to see us out here as white British people saying 'no, we don't stand for this'," attendee Phoebe Sewell, 32, from London, told AFP.</p>

<p>Fellow Londoner Jeremy Snelling, 64, said he had turned out because "I don't like the right-wing claiming the streets in my name".</p>

<p>He accused Reform party founder Farage of having "contributed" to the volatile environment.</p>

<p>"I think he is damaging and I think he's dangerous," Snelling added.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, suspected rioters continued to appear in court on Saturday.</p>

<p>Stephen Parkinson, the head of the prosecution service, said hundreds of alleged participants in the violence would soon face justice as a "new phase" of "more serious" cases worked through the system.</p>

<p>Those convicted could face jail terms of up to 10 years under the most serious offence of rioting, he warned.</p>

<p>"It's not about exacting revenge, it's about delivering justice," Parkinson said, in comments reported by the Sunday Times.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[An aircraft operated by a major Western airline recently had its onboard clocks suddenly sent forward by years, causing the plane to lose access to its digitally-encrypted communication systems.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A recent surge in GPS "spoofing", a form of digital attack that can send commercial airliners off course, has entered an intriguing new dimension, according to cybersecurity researchers: The ability to hack time.</p>

<p>There has been a 400% surge in GPS spoofing incidents affecting commercial airliners in recent months, according to aviation advisory body OPSGROUP.</p>

<p>Many of those incidents involve illicit ground-based GPS systems, particularly around conflict zones, that broadcast incorrect positions to the surrounding airspace in a bid to confuse incoming drones or missiles.</p>

<p>"We think too much about GPS being a source of position, but it's actually a source of time," Ken Munro, founder of Pen Test Partners, a British cybersecurity firm, said during a presentation at the DEF CON hacking convention in Las Vegas on Saturday.</p>

<p>"We're starting to see reports of the clocks on board airplanes during spoofing events start to do weird things."</p>

<p>In an interview with Reuters, Munro cited a recent incident in which an aircraft operated by a major Western airline had its onboard clocks suddenly sent forward by years, causing the plane to lose access to its digitally-encrypted communication systems.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The plane was grounded for weeks while engineers manually reset its onboard systems, said Munro. He declined to identify the airline or aircraft in question.</p>

<p>In April, Finnair temporarily paused flights to the eastern Estonian city of Tartu due to GPS spoofing which Tallin blamed on neighboring Russia.</p>

<p>GPS, short for Global Positioning System, has largely replaced expensive ground devices that transmit radio beams to guide planes towards landing. However, it is also fairly easy to block or distort GPS signals using relatively cheap and easy to obtain parts, and limited technological knowledge.</p>

<p>"Is it going to make a plane crash? No, it's not," Munro told Reuters.</p>

<p>"What it does is it just creates a little confusion. And you run the risk of starting what we call a cascade of events, where something minor happens, something else minor happens, and then something serious happens."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The ruling that Venezuela's Supreme Court will deliver on the disputed presidential election will be "final," the body's president Carylsia Rodriguez said Saturday at a hearing on the July 28 vote.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The ruling that Venezuela's Supreme Court will deliver on the disputed presidential election will be "final," the body's president Carylsia Rodriguez said Saturday at a hearing on the July 28 vote.</p>

<p>The court "is continuing the assessment begun on August 5, 2024, with a view to producing the final ruling... Its decisions are final and binding," said Rodriguez.</p>

<p>Most observers say the high court is loyal to the government of Nicolas Maduro, which has claimed a narrow victory in the election.</p>

<p>Opposition leaders insist that their candidate, Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia, won overwhelmingly, and they have produced what they say are official tallies from voting sites as evidence.</p>

<p>Maduro himself summoned the high court on August 1 to "validate" a victory that opponents insist was fraudulent.</p>

<p>The court heard from all candidates, including Maduro, this week -- except for Gonzalez Urrutia, who has said he fears arrest.</p>

<p>He has made no public appearances in more than a week, while key opposition leader Maria Corina Machado -- a past presidential candidate who was banned from running this time -- has said she is living in hiding.</p>

<p>The National Electoral Council (CNE) ratified Maduro's victory on August 2, saying he had won 52 percent of the vote, but it refused to release exact tallies from election sites, saying the data had been hacked.</p>

<p>The opposition, in contrast, published printed tallies -- their legitimacy denied by Maduro -- that they say show Gonzalez Urrutia receiving 67 percent of the vote.</p>

<p>The opposition and many observers say the alleged hacking of the results is a government invention to keep from having to publish election documents.</p>

<p>Maduro on Friday rejected those accusations, saying there had been "brutal" hacking, with "30 million attacks per minute on the electronic systems of the CNE and of Venezuela."</p>

<p>Opposition lawyer Perkins Rocha said that by turning to the high court Maduro was effectively acknowledging that "no one believes" the CNE, adding that "Maduro knows he can count on a (court) that kneels before him."</p>

<p>Post-election protests have left 24 people dead, according to rights groups, and Maduro says 2,200 people have been arrested.</p>

<p>He has overseen a national collapse, including an 80 percent drop in the once-wealthy oil-rich country's GDP, amid domestic economic mismanagement and international sanctions.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump's campaign said Saturday it had been hacked, blaming "foreign sources" for distributing internal communications and a dossier on running mate J.D. Vance.</p>

<p>Trump's campaign implied Iran was behind the move as news outlet Politico reported it had received emails with the campaign material from a source who refused to identify themselves.</p>

<p>"These documents were obtained illegally from foreign sources hostile to the United States, intended to interfere with the 2024 election and sow chaos throughout our Democratic process," Donald&nbsp;Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung said in a statement.</p>

<p>Steven Cheung cited a report from Microsoft this week that said Iranian hackers "sent a spear phishing email in June to a high-ranking official on a presidential campaign."</p>

<p>The materials received by Politico included research on vetting Vance, Donald&nbsp;Trump's vice presidential pick.</p>

<p>In 2016, a hack of Democratic National Committee emails -- blamed on Russians -- exposed internal party communications, including about candidate Hillary Clinton.</p>

<p>Donald&nbsp;Trump, who would go on to win the election, was criticized for encouraging the hack.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President Volodymyr Zelensky acknowledged for the first time on Saturday that Ukrainian forces were fighting in Russia's Kursk region and said the operation was part of Kyiv's drive to restore justice after Russia's 2022 invasion.</p>

<p>Russia said Ukrainian forces pushed into Kursk region last Tuesday and Russian military bloggers have acknowledged they made some headway, while saying the situation had since stabilised.</p>

<p>Zelensky had previously stayed silent about the operation.</p>

<p>In his nightly video address, the president said he had discussed the operation with top Ukrainian commander Oleksandr Syrskyi, while not forgetting the battles troops face on the difficult eastern front.</p>

<p>"Today, I received several reports from commander-in-chief Syrskyi regarding the front lines and our actions to push the war onto the aggressor's territory," he said.</p>

<p>"I am grateful to every unit of the defence forces for ensuring that. Ukraine is proving that it can indeed restore justice and ensure the necessary pressure on the aggressor."</p>

<p>Zelensky had previously alluded to the operation, praising the military's ability "to surprise" and thanking them for taking Russian soldiers prisoner to be used in future negotiations, specifically referring to the past week.</p>

<p>In paying tribute to Ukrainian forces along the 1,000-km (600-mile) front line, Zelensky made special mention of actions in northern Sumy region, across the border from Russia's Kursk region.</p>

<p>Russia has stepped up its attacks of guided bombs and other aerial strikes in Sumy, prompting mass evacuations.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lebanon's Iran-back Hezbollah group said it launched on Saturday explosive-laden drones at a north Israel army base following the killing of a Hamas commander in south Lebanon a day earlier.</p>

<p>Hezbollah fighters launched "squadrons of explosive-laden drones" at the Michve Alon base near the Galilee town of Safed "in response to the attack and assassination carried out by the Israeli enemy in the city of Sidon" on Friday, the group said in a statement.</p>

<p>Hezbollah's media office said it was "the first time" the group had targeted that base.</p>

<p>On Friday, an Israeli strike on a vehicle in the south Lebanon city of Sidon killed a Hamas commander, the Palestinian group and the Israeli military said.</p>

<p>Hamas said in a statement that Samer al-Hajj was killed "in a Zionist strike in the city of Sidon".</p>

<p>The Israeli military said that its aircraft struck the Sidon area and "eliminated" Hajj, whom it identified as "a senior commander" for Hamas in Lebanon.</p>

<p>It was the first strike of its kind in Sidon since Hamas launched its October 7 attack on Israel, triggering war in Gaza and prompting its Lebanese ally Hezbollah to begin trading near-daily cross-border fire with the Israeli army in a bid to tie down its troops.</p>

<p>Ten months of cross-border violence has killed some 562 people in Lebanon, most of them fighters but also including at least 116 civilians, according to the AFP tally.</p>

<p>On the Israeli side, including in the annexed Golan Heights, 22 soldiers and 26 civilians have been killed, according to army figures.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Brazilian emergency crews on Saturday recovered the remains of the 62 victims aboard an airliner that plunged to the ground in the town of Vinhedo, near Sao Paulo the day before, killing all on board.</p>

<p>The bodies of most of the victims - 34 males and 28 females - had already been moved to Sao Paulo's police morgue for identification. The bodies of the pilot and co-pilot were identified earlier in the day, said Dario Pacheco, mayor of Vinhedo.</p>

<p>Four people with dual citizenship were among the victims, three Venezuelans and one Portuguese woman, said regional carrier Voepass, which operated the aircraft.</p>

<p>The Venezuelans were a 4-year-old boy, his mother and grandmother, local outlet Globo News reported. The boy's dog was also on the flight, which the family was taking to later head to Colombia, according to the outlet.</p>

<p>On Friday Voepass said the plane was carrying 57 passengers and four crew, but on Saturday the firm confirmed another unaccounted-for passenger had been on the flight, putting the number of casualties at 62.</p>

<p>Authorities are using seat assignments, physical characteristics, documents and belongings such as cell phones to identify the victims, firefighter Maycon Cristo said at the crash site earlier on Saturday as the bodies were being pulled from the wreckage.</p>

<p>Relatives of the victims were brought to Sao Paulo to provide DNA samples to aid in identification of the remains, said state civil defense coordinator Henguel Pereira.</p>

<p>The plane's so-called "black box" containing voice recordings and flight data was undergoing analysis, said Marcelo Moreno, the head of Brazilian aviation accident investigation center Cenipa, at a press conference in Vinhedo.</p>

<p>The plane, an ATR-72 turboprop, was bound for Sao Paulo from Cascavel, in the state of Parana, and crashed around 1:30 p.m. (1630 GMT) in Vinhedo, some 80 km (50 miles) northwest of Sao Paulo. Despite coming down in a residential area, no one on the ground was hurt.</p>

<p>The aircraft was flying normally until 1:21 p.m., when it stopped responding to calls, and radar contact was lost at 1:22 p.m., Brazil's air force said in a statement.</p>

<p>Pilots did not report an emergency or adverse weather conditions, the air force added.</p>

<p>Franco-Italian ATR, jointly owned by Airbus and Leonardo, is the dominant producer of regional turboprop planes seating 40 to 70 people. ATR told Reuters on Friday that its specialists were "fully engaged" with the investigation into the crash.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel's military said at least 19 Palestinian operatives were killed Saturday in a pre-dawn strike on a school compound in Gaza City, where rescuers reported 93 dead.</p>

<p>"It can be confirmed at this time that at least 19 Hamas and Islamic Jihad terrorists were eliminated" in the strike on Al-Tabieen religious school, the military said in a statement.</p>

<p>It cited "an intelligence investigation" and giving the names of the alleged operatives it said had been killed.</p>

<p>It said the operatives had been operating from a Hamas command and control centre located in the compound in order to plan attacks against Israel and its security forces.</p>

<p>"The strike was carried out using three precise munitions," it said, adding that "no severe damage was caused to the compound where the terrorists were situated".</p>

<p>In another statement later Saturday, the military said: "There is a high probability that... Ashraf Juda was at the military headquarters at the Al-Tabieen school that was targeted."</p>

<p>Juda is a top operative of Islamic Jihad, the military said.</p>

<p>"It is not yet clear whether he was hit during the strike."</p>

<p>Rescue workers in Gaza have said the strike killed 93 people, including women and children. The attack has sparked international condemnation despite Israel's claims it was targetting operatives.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Turkey began unblocking Instagram Saturday evening after depriving access to millions of users for nine days.</p>

<p>"Following our negotiations with representatives of Instagram, we will unblock access starting from 9:30 pm (1830 GMT) after they agreed to respond to our demands," transport and infrastructure minister Abdulkadir Uraloglu said on X.</p>

<p>Instagram access began to progressively return after that time, AFP reporters noted.</p>

<p>"Since the beginning, we have wanted social media platforms to respect the laws of the Republic," Uraloglu insisted.</p>

<p>The platform had been blocked since the morning of August 2 for reasons that were never fully explained.</p>

<p>Saturday evening the minister mentioned "violations linked to content", adding that Instagram had refused to delete thousands of posts involving "gambling, drugs and abuse of children".</p>

<p>Meta, the owner of Instagram, denied not cooperating, saying it had withdrawn almost 2,500 posts in the first half of the year at the request of Turkish authorities.</p>

<p>President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's communications director, Fahrettin Altun, accused Instagram of blocking messages of condolence for Ismael Haniyeh, political leader of the Palestinian group Hamas and a close ally of Erdogan's.</p>

<p>Haniyeh was killed in Tehran last month in an attack blamed on Israel.</p>

<p>Between 60 and 70 percent of Turkey's 85 million inhabitants have an Instagram account, and about $57 million of business is carried out on the site each day, according to Emre Ekmekci, vice-president of an e-commerce association.</p>

<p>Access to the online game Roblox, particularly popular in Turkey, remained blocked for a fourth day Saturday evening.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Bangladesh's interim leader Muhammad Yunus on Saturday condemned attacks on the minority communities in the violence-hit nation, terming them as "heinous", and urged the youth to protect all Hindu, Christian, and Buddhist families from harm.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bangladesh's interim leader Muhammad Yunus on Saturday condemned attacks on the minority communities in the violence-hit nation, terming them as "heinous", and urged the youth to protect all Hindu, Christian, and Buddhist families from harm.</p>

<p>Members of minority communities in Bangladesh faced at least 205 incidents of attacks in 52 districts since the fall of the Sheikh Hasina-led government on August 5, according to two Hindu organisations -- Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council and the Bangladesh Puja Udjapan Parishad -- in the country.</p>

<p>Thousands of Bangladeshi Hindus have been trying to flee to neighbouring India to escape the violence.</p>

<p>Reaching out to students who are at the forefront of the protests, Yunus, a Nobel laureate, cautioned them not to let their efforts be sabotaged by those seeking to undermine their progress, the Dhaka Tribune newspaper reported.</p>

<p>"There are many standing by to make your efforts futile. Don't fail this time," he said while addressing the students at the Begum Rokeya University in Rangpur city.</p>

<p>Yunus unequivocally condemned the attacks on minority communities in the country, calling the acts "heinous".</p>

<p>He urged the students to protect all Hindu, Christian, and Buddhist families from harm.</p>

<p>“Are they not the people of this country? You have been able to save the country; can't you save some families?...You must say — no one can harm them. They are my brothers; we fought together, and we will stay together,” he asserted, underscoring the need for national unity.</p>

<p>Stressing the importance of youth leadership, Yunus said, "This Bangladesh, is now in your hands. You have the power to take it wherever you want. This isn't a matter of research — it's a power within you.” He also urged the people of Bangladesh to emulate the way student activist Abu Sayed stood valiantly during the anti-government demonstrations that led to the toppling of the Sheikh Hasina government.</p>

<p>Sayed, 25, of Rangpur's Begum Rokeya University, was among the first protesters to be killed in police firing on July 16 during the Anti-Discrimination Student Movement.</p>

<p>Yunus, who was sworn in on Thursday as the head of the interim government, met with Sayed's family members in Rangpur's Pirganj upazila, The Daily Star newspaper reported.</p>

<p>“We have to stand the way Abu Sayed stood...Abu Sayeed's mother is everyone's mother. We have to protect her, protect her sisters, protect her brothers. Everyone has to do it together,” he told reporters after meeting Sayed's family.</p>

<p>Yunus said that the responsibility of building a new Bangladesh is for every Bangladeshi.</p>

<p>“We will remember him (Abu Sayed) through this. Therefore, we should ensure that we do the work (needed),” he said.</p>

<p>“Abu Sayed is no longer a member of just one family. He is the child of all families in Bangladesh. The children who will grow up and attend school and college will know about Abu Sayed and will say to themselves, ‘I too will fight for justice.' Abu Sayed is now in every home,” Yunus said.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, thousands of Hindu agitators, including students, blocked the Shahbagh intersection for the second consecutive day on Saturday, protesting attacks on their homes, shops, and temples in various parts of the country, The Daily Star newspaper reported.</p>

<p>They shouted slogans such as "Save the Hindus," "Why are my temples and homes being looted? We want answers," "Hindu persecution in independent Bangladesh, it will not continue," "Religion is for individuals, the state is for everyone," and "Ensure the safety of Hindus".</p>

<p>A number of Hindu temples, households and businesses were vandalised, women assaulted and at least two Hindu leaders affiliated with the Awami League party headed by Hasina were killed in the violence in Bangladesh after she fled the country, according to community leaders in Dhaka.</p>

<p>The protesters warned that if immediate measures are not taken to stop the persecution of Hindus, they will go for continuous protest programmes.</p>

<p>They also demanded the formation of a ministry for minorities, the establishment of a minority protection commission, the enactment and implementation of strict laws to prevent all forms of attacks on minorities, and the allocation of 10 per cent of parliamentary seats for minorities.</p>

<p>In another major development, Bangladesh's Chief Justice Obaidul Hassan and five other top judges on Saturday tendered their resignations, five days after the fall of the Hasina regime amid massive street protests and students marching towards the apex court demanding a revamp of the judiciary.</p>

<p>The 65-year-old top judge revealed his decision around 1 pm after protesters of the Anti-Discrimination Student Movement gathered at the apex court premises. The students had issued an ultimatum to him and the judges of the Appellate Division to resign by 1 pm “I feel it is necessary to share a special news with you. Our chief justice resigned a few minutes back. His resignation letter has already reached the law ministry,” law adviser, equivalent to the minister of the newly-installed interim government, Prof Asif Nazrul said in a Facebook video message.</p>

<p>Appellate Division Justice Md Ashfaqul Islam has been appointed as the acting chief justice following Hassan's resignation, Supreme Court's Public Relations Officer Md Shafiqul Islam told the media.</p>

<p>Several other top officials, including Dhaka University Vice-Chancellor Professor Dr Maksud Kamal and Bangla Academy Director General Professor Dr Md Harun-Ur-Rashid Askari, resigned from their posts in the wake of new protests by students and other demonstrators.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kamala Harris now leads Donald Trump in three crucial battleground states, according to new polls published Saturday, apparently eroding the advantage the former president has enjoyed there over the past year.</p>

<p>The polls of likely voters by The New York Times and Siena College showed Harris leading Trump by an identical 50 percent to 46 per cent margin in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.</p>

<p>Under the US Electoral College voting system, those three populous Midwestern states are considered key to victory for either party.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The polls are a reversal of surveys in those states which for nearly a year had shown Trump either tied with or slightly leading Democratic President Joe Biden, who dropped out of the race last month and endorsed Harris instead.</p>

<p>Much can change in the nearly three months before the November 5 election. The polling showed voters still prefer Trump on the key issues of the economy and immigration, though Harris had a 24-point advantage when voters were asked whom they trust on the issue of abortion.</p>

<p>Democrats, in any case, have taken heart in the surge of enthusiasm that has greeted Harris's candidacy, with many expressing relief after 81-year-old Biden stepped aside.</p>

<p>Her announcement Tuesday of Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as her running mate also appears to have energized Democrats.</p>

<p>The Harris-Walz surge helped cut short a rise in support for Trump that followed the July 13 attempt on his life and the Republicans' successful national convention last month.</p>

<p>But Harris has enjoyed an even bigger bump in favorability -- up 10 points among registered voters in Pennsylvania in just a month, the Times/Siena polling found.</p>

<p>Voters said they saw her as more intelligent than Trump and having a better temperament to govern.</p>

<p>Trump, his running mate J.D. Vance and other Republicans have tried an array of attacks meant to weaken Harris -- with Trump even questioning her racial identity.</p>

<p>But the new polls show Democrats strongly supporting the younger and more vigorous Harris who, with Walz, has been campaigning at a furious pace this week in swing states.</p>

<p>Among Democrats, voter satisfaction with their choice of candidates has shot up by 27 points in the three Midwestern states since May, the polls found.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Three months ago, it was Republicans who expressed a higher level of satisfaction.</p>

<p>The surveys were conducted between August 5 and 9, with at least 600 voters in each state.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>French police on Saturday released US star rapper Travis Scott after 36 hours in custody in Paris over suspected violence, a US-based representative for the artist and prosecutors said.</p>

<p>The 33-year-old, who has had multiple nominations for Grammy Awards, was arrested after fighting with one of his own security guards at a five-star hotel in Paris.</p>

<p>"Travis Scott has been released with no charges," the representative said.</p>

<p>The Paris prosecutor's office confirmed the "release from custody of Travis Scott today as well as the dropping of the case over the offence being insufficiently established".</p>

<p>Police had been called to the Georges V hotel early on Friday, where they arrested the rapper for "violence against a security agent" who had intervened to separate the artist from his bodyguard, the prosecutor's office had said.</p>

<p>A US representative for Scott had said later that evening that management was in "direct communication with Parisian authorities to swiftly resolve" the matter.</p>

<p>Mr Scott was seen attending the Olympics men's basketball semi-finals on Thursday evening.</p>

<p>The rapper, whose real name is Jacques Bermon Webster II, has had previous brushes with the law in the United States.</p>

<p>The music star was arrested in Miami Beach in June for trespassing and disorderly intoxication. Police said he was involved in a fight on a yacht.</p>

<p>In November 2021, 10 people were killed in a crush at his show at a pop festival in his home city of Houston, Texas.</p>

<p>But he continues to be a prolific songwriter and producer. Scott's "Utopia" was a nominee for Best Rap Album at this year's Grammy Awards. And he has merchandising deals with Nike, video game maker Epic Games and McDonald's fast food chain.</p>

<p>Scott has two children with social media influencer and entrepreneur Kylie Jenner.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>White body bags littered the floor and mourning filled the air after a school housing displaced Palestinians was struck with Israeli missiles Saturday -- a horrific and increasingly common sight in the Gaza war.</p>

<p>Dawn prayers were shattered by the early morning triple air strike from Israeli warplanes, which gutted Al-Tabieen religious school and mosque in Gaza City.</p>

<p>In the hellish aftermath, body parts were strewn around the rubble and charred, bloodied bodies slumped in the wreckage of the two-storey complex.</p>

<p>Grim-faced volunteers piled corpses in blood-stained blankets into an ambulance, as seriously wounded men lay groaning on the ground.</p>

<p>Gaza's civil defence agency said at least 93 people were killed, 17 of them women and children, making it one of the war's deadliest strikes.</p>

<p>Israel's military disputed the death toll, saying the school was targeted with "precision munitions" because it "served as an active Hamas and Islamic Jihad military facility".</p>

<p>Such incidents have become a pattern in recent weeks. According to an AFP tally, at least 14 schools sheltering Gaza's displaced have been hit since July 6, killing more than 280 people.</p>

<p>"Peaceful people -- women, children, and youths -- were performing the Fajr prayer as usual when suddenly a missile hit them," said Abu Wassim, who lives nearby and came to survey the scene.</p>

<p>"They were reduced to remains. Children were torn apart, and women were burned. What can we say or do? What is in our power?"</p>

<p><strong>- 'They were just praying' -</strong></p>

<p>As the sun climbed and mourners gathered, one man stroked the face of a dead child shrouded in a plastic body bag.</p>

<p>"They dropped a missile on them while they were just praying. Fear God, people! Fear God, Arabs!" a woman wailed over the body.</p>

<p>Another man looked lost as he held a small corpse wrapped in a blanket. Nearby, six body bags lay on the ground, three of them children. Tattered Korans were piled on a window ledge.</p>

<p>"We woke up before dawn to the sound of a strike," said Sakr, a resident from the neighbourhood who gave just one name.</p>

<p>"We headed to the site and found body remains of civilians who were peacefully performing prayers. We found bodies of children scattered in the street."</p>

<p>Another man said: "You can't even recognise the bodies, there were scattered remains.</p>

<p>"The ones who were struck are displaced people taking shelter in a school. What's their fault? What have they done wrong?"</p>

<p>Mohammad Al-Mughayyir, director of the supply and equipment department of Gaza's civil defence service, told AFP that six schools in Gaza City had been targeted in the past week alone.</p>

<p>Israeli military spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Nadav Shoshani said that about 20 Hamas and Islamic militants were operating from the Al-Tabieen complex.</p>

<p>"The compound, and the mosque that was struck within it, served as an active Hamas and Islamic Jihad military facility," he posted on X.</p>

<p>Later on Saturday, Gaza civil defence agency spokesman Mahmud Bassal told journalists that the strike "directly targeted" two floors of the school.</p>

<p>The strike hit "the upper floor housing women and children and the ground floor that was used for prayers by the displaced people," he said.</p>

<p>The Gaza war was triggered by Hamas's October 7 attack that resulted in the deaths of 1,198 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures.</p>

<p>Palestinian militants seized 251 hostages, 111 of whom are still held in Gaza, including 39 the Israeli military says are dead.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory military campaign in Gaza has killed at least 39,790 people, according to the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza, which does not give details of civilian and militant deaths.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A week of fast-paced developments in Bangladesh, which saw Sheikh Hasina's ouster, widespread violence and the formation of an interim government, has been capped off with the country's chief justice agreeing to step down on Saturday. While it is unclear when elections will be held, what is certain is that the Khaleda Zia-led Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), one of the two big political parties in the country, will be playing a key role in them.</p>

<p>Speaking exclusively to NDTV on Saturday, Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir, the general secretary of the BNP, said that the stepping down of the chief justice was brought about by student protests because he was known to be closely associated with Ms Hasina's regime, which "killed many people" in the country.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-08/4l797np_mirza-fakhrul-islam-alamgir_625x300_10_August_24.jpg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>In the wide-ranging interview, Mr Alamgir said that Ms Zia will lead the BNP in the elections if she is fit enough to do so and that the party would work to improve the India-Bangladesh relationship if it comes to power. He said that the attacks on Hindus in the country were a result of some people trying to take advantage of the situation and stressed that they were not part of any "systematic agenda".</p>

<p>The BNP leader also said he believes that the Bangladesh army will not interfere in the political process going forward and also claimed that no extremist elements were involved in the protests.</p>

<p>Asked about the chief justice stepping down, Mr Alamgir said, "The chief justice is known here as an associate of the former regime, which killed so many people in this country and extraordinary, unprecedented corruption was done during this period... So there was always a demand for his removal. He was not exactly free, fair and neutral and that's why the demand was very high."</p>

<p>"The judiciary in Bangladesh has totally been destroyed. It is an institution but, with the help of the last regime, it was totally politicised," he added.</p>

<p><strong>Election Timeframe?</strong></p>

<p>While Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus has taken oath as the head of an interim government and is seen as popular among the movement that led to Ms Hasina being ousted, the question on everyone's mind is when elections will be held again in Bangladesh.</p>

<p>When Mr Alamgir was asked about this and the role 78-year-old Khaleda Zia, who was released from prison this week, would be able to play in the elections, he said, "She's very sick. She's in the hospital. She's suffering from multidisciplinary diseases. Her treatment was not going well in this country and we we requested the judiciary as well as the government several times to send her abroad, but that didn't happen... Doctors say she's not fit to travel right now and we will have to wait for some time before taking her outside the country. If she's physically fit, she will definitely contest the election."</p>

<p>The BNP leader said that while his party is ready for polls at any point, the interim government would need more time to conduct them.</p>

<p>"The entire election machinery has become totally polluted and they are not in a position to hold a free-and-fair election. So they will have to bring some reforms in the election system as well," he said.</p>

<p>Mr Alamgir also rubbished a claim made by Sheikh Hasina's son, Sajeeb Wazed, that the prime minister had not resigned, as well as reports that she was removed at gunpoint.</p>

<p>"The President himself, in the presence of political parties and the army, said she had resigned. There was no coercion or anything... It was a revolution. When the mob of lakhs of people was moving towards Ms Hasina's residence, her security forces and the armed forces told her she had two choices: stay here and be mobbed or leave the country. And, at the last moment, she decided to leave the country,"she said.</p>

<p><strong>Ties With India, Attacks On Minorities</strong></p>

<p>Mr Alamgir emphasised that the India-Bangladesh relationship would continue to be sound and said the BNP would strive to improve it if it came to power.</p>

<p>When the leader was asked about attacks on minorities in the country, including Hindus, Buddhists and Christians, and whether there was a systemic attack, he said, "This is not at all true. When there is a change in our country or any country, especially in third-world countries, there are some people who try to take advantage... In Bangladesh, unfortunately, with every revolution, leaders of the incumbent party are victimised, whether they are Muslims or Hindus. There may be some sporadic attacks (on minorities) but it was not at all a political or systematic agenda. Never," he said, claiming that communal harmony in the country is "superb".</p>

<p><strong>UN Involvement</strong></p>

<p>When the BNP leader was asked whether there would be a vendetta against the supporters of Ms Hasina's Party - the Awami League - or a purge of former army and police officers seen as close to her government, he said that the United Nations has been asked to conduct an investigation.</p>

<p>"If anybody is found guilty of violating human rights, systematic killing of the opposition or enforced disappearances, naturally, their cases will be investigated and they'll be taken to task," he said.</p>

<p>Mr Alamgir also said that he did not believe that there would be any interference from the army in the political process going forward.</p>

<p>"People have confidence in the army that they are the saviours of the country. So I don't think they will do anything which will go against the will of the people," he said.</p>

<p><strong>Extremist Elements?</strong></p>

<p>The violence in the country has died down to a large extent, Mr Alamgir said, and sought to allay fears of extremist elements being involved in the movement against Ms Hasina's rule.</p>

<p>"The Jamaat (Jamaat-e-Islami) is not an extremist political party, but there were other extremist groups in Bangladesh and I don't believe they are in existence now... Extremist elements are not involved (in protests) in any way. Not at all. It is totally (led by) students and most of them are very progressive elements. Some of the people leading the movement are extraordinarily talented. I am certain and I believe that this revolution will definitely succeed," he added.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Alphabet and Google CEO Sundar Pichai has revealed that former YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki, who passed away after two years of living with lung cancer, once took him for an ice cream and a walk around campus during his Google interview 20 years ago.</p>

<p>Remembering the days when he joined Google, Mr Pichai said he was so fortunate to have spent so many years working with Susan closely.</p>

<p>"Susan always put others first, both in her values and in the day to day. I'll never forget her kindness to me as a prospective 'Noogler' 20 years ago," Mr Pichai wrote.</p>

<p>He further said: "I was sold - on Google and Susan. She was absolutely loved by her teams. Her time on earth was far too short, but she made every minute count".</p>

<p>Mr Pichai termed Susan's loss as devastating for "all of us who know and love her, for the thousands of Googlers she led over the years, and for millions of people all over the world who looked up to her" as she created incredible things at Google, YouTube and beyond.</p>

<p>Susan was one of Google's earliest employees and had received a 'Google Founders Award' for making AdSense, which helped tremendously in Google's advertising. Her tenure as CEO of YouTube saw the platform's growth into a global powerhouse, impacting millions of content creators and billions of viewers.</p>

<p>Mr Pichai said that Susan's journey, from the garage she rented to Larry Page and Sergey Brin (Google founders) to leading teams across consumer products and building Ads business to becoming the CEO of YouTube, one of the world's most significant platforms, "is inspiring by any measure".</p>

<p>But she didn't stop there. As one of the earliest Googlers -- and the first to take maternity leave -- Susan used her position to build a better workplace for everyone.</p>

<p>In the years that followed, her advocacy around parental leave set a new standard for businesses everywhere. Susan was also deeply passionate about education.</p>

<p>Over the last two years, Susan devoted herself to making the world better through her philanthropy, including supporting research for the disease that ultimately took her life.</p>

<p>"I know that was very meaningful to her and I'm so glad she took the time to do it," said Pichai, adding that let's honour Susan's memory by continuing to build a Google she would be proud of.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>North Korea is launching more balloons believed to be carrying trash southward, South Korea's military said Saturday, the latest in a series of border barrages that have ignited a tit-for-tat propaganda war.</p>

<p>North Korea has sent thousands of trash-filled balloons southward since May, saying they are retaliation for propaganda balloons launched by South Korean activists.</p>

<p>The latest launch comes as relations between the two Koreas are at one of their lowest points in years, with the North recently announcing the deployment of 250 ballistic missile launchers to its southern border.</p>

<p>The nuclear-armed North was "again launching (suspected) trash balloons aimed at the South," Seoul's Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement late Saturday.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It advised the public to refrain from touching the balloons and to report them to authorities.</p>

<p>Last month, balloons launched by Pyongyang hit the South Korean presidential compound in the capital, prompting the government to mobilise chemical response teams to collect them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In response to the balloon barrages, Seoul has resumed propaganda broadcasts along the frontier, suspended a tension-reducing military deal and restarted live-fire drills in some border areas.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The isolated North is extremely sensitive about its people's exposure to South Korean pop culture. According to a recent South Korean government report, a man was executed in 2022 for possession of content from the South.</p>

<p>On Thursday, Seoul's military said a suspected North Korean had defected to the South across a de facto maritime border in the Yellow Sea, with some experts suggesting the decision may have been influenced by the South's resumed propaganda broadcasts, which include news reports as well as K-pop content.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Despite the ongoing military campaign against Hezbollah, the observers assert that they continue to be sidelined. Many believe this is partly due to an ingrained culture of misogyny within the IDF.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For over a year, a dedicated group of young women in Israel's military has been on high alert, observing movements along the border with Lebanon. This female-only unit, known as field observers, has played a critical role in identifying threats from Hezbollah, diligently tracking the group's activities from their posts. These soldiers, aged between 18 and 20, are responsible for monitoring drone activity, mortar rounds, and rockets that have plagued northern Israel since last October. Yet, even as tensions escalated, they feel their warnings and contributions have been largely ignored.</p>

<p>"We are unprotected, which is a problem for us, but it is also dangerous for our work, which is very important," an observer near the border with Lebanon told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/10/04/israel-female-field-observers-october-7-attacks-hamas-gaza/" rel="NoFollowNoIndex">The Washington Post</a>. "Our superiors only want to shut us up, to not come to them with complaints, so they're ignoring us even more," she added.</p>

<p>Despite the ongoing military campaign against Hezbollah, the observers assert that they continue to be sidelined. Many believe this is partly due to an ingrained culture of misogyny within the IDF.</p>

<p>"It is a male army, where the 'girls' are seen as hysterical, where the commanders regularly say, 'If you continue to send these alarms, you will be put in jail,'" said Gili Yuval, a former field observer who served during the early 2000s when Israel withdrew its forces and dismantled its settlements in Gaza.</p>

<p>Since October 7, she has led a loosely organized network of current and former observers, supplying essentials like food and clothing to victims of the attack.</p>

<p>The IDF has declined to comment on the circumstances surrounding these claims.</p>

<p>Gili Shrvit, 20, an observer stationed at another location along the Gaza border in Kissufim, recounted that on the morning of October 7, she was at her workstation, trembling and in tears as she reported the unfolding devastation: Hundreds of Hamas gunmen had breached their fence, shot out their cameras, and invaded their base.</p>

<p>"We were calling our superiors, telling them we are about to die," she recalled. "They said they have no one for us."</p>

<p>They took cover under their workstations, with no weapons to defend themselves, Shrvit recalled. Their commanders, located 20 miles away, informed them that combat soldiers were trapped in ambushes and could not assist.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Donald Trump on Friday promoted an endorsement from JPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jamie Dimon has firmly denied former US president Donald Trump's recent claim that the CEO of JPMorgan Chase has endorsed him for the US presidency. This clarification came shortly after Trump claimed he had Dimon's support. A spokesperson for Dimon, Joe Evangelisti, refuted the endorsement, telling <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/04/trump-jamie-dimon-endorsement-jpmorgan.html" rel="nofollow,noindex">CNBC</a>, “Jamie Dimon has not endorsed anyone. He has not endorsed a candidate.”<br />
<br />
According to the CNBC report, Trump on his social media platform, Truth Social, shared a screenshot falsely claiming that Dimon was backing his presidential bid. The post read, “New: Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JPMorgan Chase, has endorsed Trump for President.”<br />
<br />
The claim seems to have first surfaced on X (formerly Twitter) on October 4 and was quickly circulated by several pro-Trump accounts. It gained further traction when Trump himself shared it before JPMorgan Chase issued a denial.<br />
<br />
However, when NBC questioned Trump about the post on October 4, the former president claimed ignorance of its origin, distancing himself from responsibility. He told NBC, “Somebody put it up. I don't know.” Even hours after the remark, the post was still accessible on Trump's official social media account. CNBC's attempts to contact the Trump campaign for further comment went unanswered.<br />
<br />
Earlier in September, Dimon made his political stance clear during an interview at the JPMorgan Investor Summit in Mumbai. At the time, he emphasised his neutrality, stating, “I'm not endorsing anyone at this time.”<br />
<br />
Although Dimon has occasionally praised Trump, he also criticised the former president. Their relationship has seen its share of public disputes. During the Republican primaries, Dimon voiced support for former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, urging business leaders to back her instead of Trump.<br />
<br />
Trump, in response, lashed out at Dimon for endorsing Haley, recalling their interactions during his presidency. He said, “I've never been a big Jamie Dimon fan, but had to live with this guy when he came begging to the White House,” adding fuel to their already tense rapport.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A Vincent Van Gogh aficionado in Bosnia has turned a plot of land into a giant, living reproduction of the painter's masterpiece, "Starry Night", composed of thousands of plants.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Vincent Van Gogh aficionado in Bosnia has turned a plot of land into a giant, living reproduction of the painter's masterpiece, "Starry Night", composed of thousands of plants.</p>

<p>"Vincent Van Gogh belongs to us too. It's our heritage and this is a way of paying tribute to him," Halim Zukic told AFP.</p>

<p>Behind him, tens of thousands of lavender bushes, grasses and other plants form swirls and spirals across a dozen hectares that -- seen from the air -- unmistakably resemble the celestial configuration painted by the Dutch post-Impressionist master in 1889.</p>

<p>"It wasn't possible to simply reproduce a flat image on a three-dimensional space," Zukic said.</p>

<p>"Inspired by the painting, we tried to stick to the shapes and proportions, so that it looks like the painting as much as possible.</p>

<p>"And I think we succeeded."</p>

<p>The 56-year-old entrepreneur first noticed the land 20 years ago when he was returning from a day out picking mushrooms nearby, in the woods surrounding the village of Luznica in central Bosnia.</p>

<p>He bought the first plot with the idea of building a hut and creating a small, rounded garden.</p>

<p>At the time, he wasn't even thinking about "Starry Night", one of the favourite landscapes in New York's Museum of Modern Art (MoMA).</p>

<p>But the idea just clicked in 2018 when Zukic noticed the tracks left on the lawn by a tractor.</p>

<p>"To my eyes, these tracks looked like spirals from "Starry Night" and it was an immediate decision."</p>

<p><strong>130,000 lavender plants</strong></p>

<p>The former insurance company owner, who now works in tourism, bought more land and started working it, helped daily by up to 20-30 gardeners.</p>

<p>He declined to say what it cost to complete his labour of love, which took six years to acquire its final shape.</p>

<p>"We planted around 130,000 lavender bushes, tens of thousands of aromatic and medicinal plants, several thousand trees," he said.</p>

<p>"There isn't a single straight line in the park -- just like in nature."</p>

<p>At the same time, Zukic became interested in Van Gogh, about whom he knew very little at the time.</p>

<p>Today, Zukic talks animatedly about the painter, his "love of nature" and the "passion with which he did his work".</p>

<p>In 2023, he travelled to France to visit the places where Van Gogh spent some of his most prolific years -- Arles and Saint-Remy-en-Provence.</p>

<p>The artist painted "Starry Night" in June 1889 while he was in a Saint Remy psychiatric hospital.</p>

<p>A year later, he committed suicide, aged 37.</p>

<p>For the time being, only a handful of visitors have had the chance to appreciate Zukic's park.</p>

<p>The plants and trees still need time to flourish so the public will need a few more months of patience, he said. "Having money is not enough. You need time for a park," he said. "I'd say we've created a good foundation. The park will be more beautiful every year."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[It is "really hard to tell" if Israel will use the anniversary of Hamas' October 7 attacks to retaliate, a top US State Department official told CNN on Friday.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel hasn't clarified its intention of targeting Iran's nuclear facilities in retaliation for the Iranian ballistic missile strikes earlier this week on Tuesday. It is as ambiguous as it could be. It is "really hard to tell" if Israel will use the anniversary of Hamas' October 7 attacks to retaliate, a top US State Department official told CNN on Friday.</p>

<p>"We hope and expect to see some wisdom as well as strength, but as you guys know, no guarantees," the official said when asked by CNN if Israel has assured the US that Iran's nuclear sites are off the table.</p>

<p>"I think in some ways they would want to avoid the seventh, so in my estimation, if there is anything it would likely be before or after," the senior State Department official said.</p>

<p>Iran launched a barrage of 181 ballistic missiles at Israel on Tuesday night, triggering nationwide air raid sirens and forcing nearly 10 million Israelis into bomb shelters. Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) claimed responsibility for the missile assault, targeting three Israeli military bases near Tel Aviv.</p>

<p>Although a majority of missiles were intercepted, there were scattered reports of damage and injuries. In Tel Aviv, two civilians were lightly injured by shrapnel, while in the West Bank city of Jericho, a Palestinian civilian was killed by debris from one of the missiles, news agency AFP reported. The Israeli military quickly announced that the immediate threat had passed, and civilians were allowed to leave bomb shelters after an hour.</p>

<p>US officials have voiced support for Israel and its response to Iran's missile attack earlier this week. "Israel has a right to defend itself, as any nation does. In terms of what Israel's response will be, of course, there must be consequences for Iran for this attack. We've made clear that there must be consequences," said Matthew Miller, Spokesperson, US Department of State, during a press briefing.</p>

<p>President Joe Biden opposed Israel's idea of targeting Iran's nuclear facilities.</p>

<p>"If I were in their shoes, I'd be thinking about other alternatives than striking oil fields," Biden said at a press briefing Friday.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The Caribbean nation aims to become the world's most climate-resilient island without accruing massive debt or waiting for promised aid from wealthier nations.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a bid to rebuild and thrive after the devastation of Hurricane Maria seven years ago, Dominica has turned to an unconventional funding source: selling passports, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2024/10/04/dominica-hurricane-passports/" rel="NoFollowNoIndex">The Washington Post</a> reported. The Caribbean nation aims to become the world's most climate-resilient island without accruing massive debt or waiting for promised aid from wealthier nations. By offering citizenship to affluent individuals, often from China and the Middle East, for hundreds of thousands of dollars, Dominica has found a way to fund its ambitious recovery efforts.</p>

<p>The nation's citizenship programme dates back to the 1990s but has rapidly expanded since the hurricane, becoming the primary source of national revenue. Funds raised have been directed toward critical infrastructure projects, including new medical clinics and residential complexes for those displaced by the storm. Former Foreign Minister Francine Baron calls the initiative a "saviour," while Finance Minister Irving McIntyre emphasized the need for a "self-dependent form of financing" to tackle climate change.</p>

<p>"This programme means a lot to us. We realised we had to get a self-dependent form of financing to deal with climate change," Mr McIntyre told The Post.</p>

<p>Despite its success, the programme has raised eyebrows over transparency and security concerns. Although the price for citizenship has recently increased to a minimum of $200,000 (Rs 1.68 crore), it remains one of the most affordable options globally. Some recipients reside in Dominica, a small island with a population of 71,000, known for its lush landscapes.</p>

<p>The aftermath of Hurricane Maria severely damaged the economy, with losses estimated at over double the country's gross domestic product (GDP). Prime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit vowed to rebuild better and more resilient, emphasizing the urgent need for funding to mitigate future climate risks.</p>

<p>Dominican officials claim that climate change, largely driven by emissions from wealthier nations, is resulting in hurricanes that are both more frequent and severe.</p>

<p>Dominica's proactive stance on climate resilience includes substantial investments in housing and infrastructure. The government claims to have funded around 2,000 homes in locations designed to withstand future disasters.</p>

<p>The nation aims to invest in resilient infrastructure to mitigate climate risks while seeking support from developed nations amid a funding shortfall highlighted by the UN in global climate discussions.</p>

<p>While passport sales have become a lifeline, the approach has sparked debates about the potential risks associated with granting citizenship to individuals with unclear backgrounds. Critics argue that such programs may not be adequately scrutinized. The European Union and other international bodies have raised alarms regarding security measures, especially following reports of Dominica issuing passports to individuals from dubious backgrounds.</p>

<p>Despite the scrutiny, the demand for Dominican passports remains robust. With limited flight options to the US, the island has become a hub for those seeking greater mobility and access through alternative citizenship. However, the rapid growth of the programme has prompted calls for greater oversight and accountability.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A beluga whale "Hvaldimir", found dead in Norway in August, was not shot to death as claimed by animal rights groups but died of bacterial infection, said Norwegian Police.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A beluga whale “Hvaldimir”, found dead in Norway in August, reportedly died of bacterial infection and not gunshot wounds, said Norwegian police on Friday. The probable cause of bacterial infection is the wound in the mouth, caused by a stuck stick.</p>

<p>The 14-foot-long and 2,700-pound whale was first spotted in 2019 with a harness reading “Equipment St. Petersburg” fueling speculations that the whale was a Russian spy. This prompted people to nickname him Hvaldimir, the spy whale. Hvaldimir is a blend of the Norwegian word for whale, "hval," and the first name of Russian President Vladimir Putin.</p>

<p>The white whale was found dead outside Stavanger on August 31.</p>

<p>Animal rights organizations NOAH and One Whale claimed the whale had been shot dead and filed a police report. Following this, the Veterinary Institute in Sandnes, on behalf of the Directorate of Fisheries, conducted an autopsy and found a 35-centimeter (14-inch) stick lodged in his mouth.</p>

<p>“The report concluded that the probable cause of death was a bacterial infection, possibly a result of wounds in his mouth caused by a stick that got stuck,” Amund Preede Revheim, Norway police official said.</p>

<p>“Pinnen (Norwegian word for peg, a wooden stick) may also have led to Hvaldimir having challenges with its nutrition, thus increasing infections,” stated the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.politiet.no/aktuelt-tall-og-fakta/aktuelt/nyheter/2024/10/04/sor---vest-oppdatering-hvaldimir-endelig-obduksjonsrapport-er-klar/">press release</a> issued by Norway police.</p>

<p>“Assessment done by the Veterinary Institute and police criminal technicians found that there was no injury. X-ray of the chest and head can be conducted without the presence of a projector or other metal fragments,” it added.</p>

<p>The police didn't find any trace of bullets and therefore, no further investigation was done.</p>

<p>“There are no investigations that indicate that Hvaldimir is living illegally. The police therefore had no reason to launch an investigation into the whale's death, and responded to the incoming report”, said Preed Revheim.</p>

<p>For biosecurity reasons, remains are usually destroyed after autopsies at the Veterinary Institute. In this case, the Directorate of Fisheries has decided to donate the skeleton of the white whale Hvaldimir to the Nature Museum and Botanical Garden at UiA University in Agder.</p>

<p>Last year, Norway requested its citizens to avoid any contact with Hvaldimir who was seen in a fjord close to Oslo.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>About 600 people were killed within a few hours by members affiliated with Al-Qaeda in an August attack on the town of Barsalogho in Burkina Faso, a report claimed on Friday. The residents of Barsalogho were shot dead on August 24 as they dug protective trenches.</p>

<p>The attack, in which most of the victims were women and children, was <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/170-people-executed-in-attacks-on-3-villages-in-burkina-faso-report-5167872" target="_blank">one of the worst in the West African country's history</a>, which has been grappling with a jihadist insurgency waged by rebels affiliated with Al-Qaeda and the Islamic State group that spilled over from neighbouring Mali in 2015.</p>

<p>The members of Jama'at Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM), an Al-Qaeda affiliate based in Mali and active in <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/browns-not-greens-how-an-arid-africa-country-is-reimagining-golf-courses-3876165" target="_blank">Burkina Faso</a>, shot down villagers as they swept into the outskirts of Barsalogho on bikes.</p>

<p>While the United Nations estimated a death count of around 200, JNIM said it had killed nearly 300 "fighters". However, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/10/04/africa/burkina-faso-massacre-600-dead-french-intel-intl/index.html" rel="nofollow,noindex">CNN</a>, citing a French government security assessment, reported that up to 600 people were shot dead in the attack.</p>

<p>A man, who said he was one of dozens of men told to dig the trenches by the army, told CNN that he was 4 kilometers from the town at about 11 am, in a trench, when he heard the first gunshots.</p>

<p>“I started to crawl into the trench to escape.&nbsp;But it seemed that the attackers were following the trenches. So, I crawled out and came across the first bloodied victim. There was blood everywhere on my way. There was screaming everywhere. I got down on my stomach under a bush, until later in the afternoon, hiding,” he said.</p>

<p>Another survivor, who lost two members of her family in the attack, said JNIM killed people "all day long".</p>

<p>"For three days we were collecting bodies - scattered everywhere. Fear got into our hearts. At the burial time, there are so many bodies lying on the ground that burying was hard," she said.</p>

<p>The military reportedly ordered the locals to dig a vast trench network around the town to protect it from jihadists circulating nearby.</p>

<p>JNIM has warned civilians against endorsing the army in its fight against the insurgency.</p>

<p>According to the ACLED analysis group, which tracks global conflict, members affiliated with Al-Qaeda - which was founded by Osama bin Laden and carried out the 9/11 attacks in the US - and the Islamic State group have killed about 3,800 this year.</p>

<p>Since the start of the conflict in 2015, more than 20,000 people have been killed and over two million displaced in <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/burkina-faso-army-announces-overthrow-of-military-government-amid-violence-3393970" target="_blank">Burkina Faso</a>, one of the world's poorest countries situated in the Sahel, a region wracked by instability.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Israeli airstrikes continued to pound Beirut on Saturday after Iran's supreme leader declared the country's allies won't back down in the war in West Asia that threatens severe global ramifications.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<ol>
	<li class="CetSht_li">The Israeli army issued fresh evacuation orders in Beirut's southern suburbs last evening, after which a series of loud blasts were heard in the area near the airport.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Hezbollah is also engaged in ongoing clashes with Israeli troops in the Lebanon border area during ground raids. It said in a statement that Israeli soldiers tried to approach the village of Adaysseh when their operatives confronted them.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Three hospitals in Lebanon were forced to suspend work after damages due to Israeli strikes as the Lebanese Prime Minister urged the global community to pressure Israel to allow rescuers to reach bombed sites.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Israel is now fighting both Palestine and Lebanon, which are part of the Iran-backed 'Axis of Resistance' group, in a war that started with the October 7 attack by Hamas and has now widened to a regional conflict.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">The Palestinian Hamas group's October 7, 2023 attack, called the 'Al-Aqsa Flood', had targeted Israeli border towns, sparking a fierce West Asia showdown that continues till date. The Lebanese Hezbollah group - also backed by Iran-later entered the war in support of Hamas.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Khamenei yesterday said its allies won't back down and defended his country's missile strikes on Israel. In a rare public sermon, he asserted after leading the Friday prayers that Israel would "not last long".</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">The Israeli Defence Forces, which has been conducting ground raids inside Lebanon, claimed in their latest update they have eliminated over 2,000 military targets and 250 Hezbollah operatives, including over a dozen commanders.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">The Israeli Air Force has also been pounding Beirut and its suburbs with airstrikes over the past few weeks. Former Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah was killed in one such strike a week, dealing a major blow to the Lebanese group.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Iran's missile salvo on Israel on Tuesday marked a massive escalation in the West Asia war as Israel vowed to hit back stronger. It is feared that Israel may target oil and nuclear infrastructure in the country. Fears of oil supply disruptions have already sparked a rise in oil prices.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">US President Joe Biden has advised Israel against striking oil facilities in Iran. But his predecessor Donald Trump, who is contesting November polls to return to the White House, has said that he believes Israel should strike Iran's nuclear facilities in response to the missile barrage.</li>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Biden administration will not renew a temporary humanitarian entry program for hundreds of thousands of migrants with US sponsors who arrived in recent years, the US Department of Homeland Security said on Friday (October 4).</p>

<p>Some 530,000 migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela have entered the US by air since October 2022 and received two-year grants under the "parole" program that will begin to expire in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>However, many of those migrants could remain in the country under other programs.</p>

<p>The parole program allows migrants with existing US sponsors to enter the country for humanitarian reasons or if their entry is deemed a significant public benefit. It will continue to accept new applications from those abroad.</p>

<p>US President Joe Biden's administration launched the parole program as a way to provide migrants avenues to enter legally and decrease illegal crossings at the US-Mexico border. Record numbers of migrants were caught crossing illegally during Biden's presidency but crossings have plummeted in recent months as Biden rolled out new border restrictions.</p>

<p>Immigration is a top voter issue in the Nov. 5 election that will pit Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris against Republican Donald Trump, who has criticized the parole program.</p>

<p>The decision not to renew the parole program for the four nationalities follows the plan outlined by DHS when the program was launched, spokesperson Naree Ketudat said in a statement.</p>

<p>Migrants without permission to remain in US "will need to depart the United States prior to the expiration of their authorized parole period or may be placed in removal proceedings," Ketudat said.</p>

<p>Other parole programs for Ukrainians and Afghans have been extended.</p>

<p>Most of the four nationalities allowed entry under the so-called CHNV parole program have avenues to stay in the US.</p>

<p>Many Cubans are eligible for permanent residence and eventual citizenship under the 1966 Cuban Adjustment Act.</p>

<p>Most Haitians and Venezuelans in the US are eligible for Temporary Protected Status, which grants them deportation relief and work permits.</p>

<p>All four nationalities could apply for asylum.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Brazilian labour court said Friday it had ordered German automaker Mercedes-Benz to pay the equivalent of $7.3 million in damages for discrimination and harassment suffered by workers at a factory in Sao Paulo state.</p>

<p>The court in the southern city of Campinas, where the factory is located, said employees who suffered workplace injuries were sidelined on their return to work and "exposed to humiliating and degrading situations," including racial discrimination.</p>

<p>Court documents showed that, between 2004 and 2019, several workers at Mercedes-Benz's biggest parts distribution and logistics center outside Germany were mistreated after suffering workplace illnesses or injuries.</p>

<p>On their return to work from sick leave, they suffered "isolation, including physical isolation" and were "deprived of opportunities for promotion and salary increases after being designated a 'divergent group'."</p>

<p>One worker testified that he was called a "monkey son of a bitch" by a colleague of his boss for not being able to carry more than five kilograms (11 pounds) of materials.</p>

<p>The victim filed a complaint with his supervisor but instead received a three-day suspension from work.</p>

<p>Another of the plaintiffs, who is black, said that when he returned to the job he was assigned tasks such as serving coffee and washing the car of a manager, who on one occasion mocked his skin color.</p>

<p>The judge in the case rejected Mercedes-Benz's claim that the practices were "isolated incidents," saying to accept that explanation would represent a "serious" setback for workers' rights.</p>

<p>Mercedes-Benz did not immediately respond to an AFP query about the case.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A wave of violence in a Mexican cartel stronghold shaken by gang infighting has left around 150 people dead over the past month, according to the state prosecutor's office.</p>

<p>They include five men whose bodies were found with gunshot wounds Thursday night on a main avenue in Culiacan, authorities said.</p>

<p>A turf war broke out on September 9 between two factions of the Sinaloa Cartel, one of Mexico's most violent and powerful drug trafficking organizations.</p>

<p>Some local police suspected of involvement have been disarmed by the military.</p>

<p>The clashes follow the dramatic July 25 arrest on US soil of Sinaloa Cartel co-founder Ismael "El Mayo" Zambada, who claimed he had been kidnapped in Mexico and delivered into US custody against his will.</p>

<p>Zambada, 76, was detained along with Joaquin Guzman Lopez, a son of El Chapo, who is serving a life sentence in the United States.</p>

<p>The violence is believed to pit gang members loyal to El Chapo and his sons against others aligned with Zambada, who pleaded not guilty to a raft of charges in a New York court last month.</p>

<p>Former Mexican president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said before leaving office this week that the United States shared blame for the infighting because of Zambada's arrest -- a claim rejected by US ambassador Ken Salazar.</p>

<p>Washington denies having planned his capture.</p>

<p>Spiraling criminal violence, much of it linked to drug trafficking and gangs, has seen more than 450,000 people murdered in Mexico since 2006.</p>

<p>Claudia Sheinbaum, who was sworn in Tuesday as Mexico's first woman president, has pledged to stick to Lopez Obrador's "hugs not bullets" strategy of using social policy to tackle crime at its roots.</p>

<p>The former Mexico City mayor and key ruling party figure is due to unveil her security plan next week.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Elon Musk's X has paid millions of dollars in fines in Brazil to settle a row with a judge who banned the platform in its biggest Latin American market over disinformation.</p>

<p>But the platform transferred the money into the wrong account, Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes, who ordered the shutdown of X in August, said Friday (October 4).</p>

<p>X, formerly known as Twitter, racked up $5.2 million in fines for failing to comply with a series of court orders.</p>

<p>Moraes confirmed that the social network had paid the full amount but into a different account from the one on the court order and said it had ordered that the funds be immediately redirected.</p>

<p>Moraes blocked X on August 31 after Musk refused to remove dozens of right-wing accounts accused of spreading disinformation and failed to name a new legal representative in the country as ordered.</p>

<p>X, which had 22 million users in Brazil before Moraes blocked it, hopes that payment of the penalties will settle the dispute.</p>

<p>Last week it said it had complied with the court's other demands, including the appointment of a legal representative in Brazil.</p>

<p>The clash between Musk and Moraes morphed into a high-stakes battle which was closely followed around the globe as a test of both freedom of expression and the fight against disinformation.</p>

<p>A furious Musk hit out at Moraes over the ban calling him an "evil dictator" and dubbing him "Voldemort" after the villain from the "Harry Potter" series.</p>

<p>But in recent days he had been notably more muted on the subject and X has appeared eager to do whatever necessary to have the ban lifted.</p>

<p>The platform had briefly resumed service in Brazil in mid-September after a technical workaround which it claimed was "inadvertent."</p>

<p>But it went back offline again after Moraes threatened it with further fines.</p>

<p>X's fight with Moraes began during Brazil's 2022 presidential election campaign, when Moraes ordered the company to deactivate accounts of followers of failed far-right incumbent Jair Bolsonaro.</p>

<p>The standoff escalated following attacks by Bolsonaro supporters on federal buildings in Brasilia after the inauguration of Bolsonaro's leftist rival Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva as president in January 2023.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Republican White House hopeful Donald Trump said Friday he believes Israel should strike Iran's nuclear facilities in response to the Islamic republic's recent missile barrage.</p>

<p>The former president, speaking at a campaign event in North Carolina, referred to a question posed to Democratic President Joe Biden this week about the possibility of Israel targeting Iran's nuclear program.</p>

<p>"They asked him, what do you think about Iran, would you hit Iran? And he goes, 'As long as they don't hit the nuclear stuff.' That's the thing you want to hit, right?" Trump told a town hall style event in Fayetteville, near a major US military base.</p>

<p>Biden was asked on Wednesday whether he would support strikes against Iranian nuclear sites and the US president told reporters: "The answer is no."</p>

<p>"I think he's got that one wrong," Trump said Friday, in response to a participant's question about the issue. "Isn't that what you're supposed to hit? I mean, it's the biggest risk we have, nuclear weapons," he said.</p>

<p>"When they asked him that question, the answer should have been, hit the nuclear first, and worry about the rest later," Trump added.</p>

<p>"If they're going to do it, they're going to do it. But we'll find out whatever their plans are."</p>

<p>Biden on Wednesday expressed his opposition to such strikes against Iran's nuclear facilities, in response to the firing of nearly 200 Iranian missiles towards Israel.</p>

<p>"We'll be discussing with the Israelis what they're going to do," he said, adding that all G7 members agree Israel has "a right to respond, but they should respond in proportion."</p>

<p>Trump, locked in a tooth-and-nail presidential election battle with US Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, has spoken little about the recent escalation in tensions in the Middle East.</p>

<p>He issued a scathing statement this week, holding Biden and Harris responsible for the crisis.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump on Friday promoted a fake endorsement from JPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon, who has not taken a side in the US presidential election.</p>

<p>Trump posted to his Truth Social platform a photograph of Dimon with the headline: "New: Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JPMorgan Chase, has endorsed Trump for President."</p>

<p>The item, posted by Trump around 1800 GMT, appeared to be a repost of another social media item.</p>

<p>But a JPMorgan spokesman said the longtime bank head has not taken a side in the race.</p>

<p>"That report was false," said JPMorgan spokesman Joe Evangelisti in an email to AFP. "Jamie has not endorsed a candidate."</p>

<p>Trump in August shared doctored images that purported to show superstar singer Taylor Swift supporting his presidential campaign.</p>

<p>But Swift last month delivered a sweeping endorsement to Trump's opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris. The doctored images shared by Trump "conjured up my fears around AI, and the dangers of spreading misinformation," she wrote in a September 11 Instagram post.</p>

<p>"The simplest way to combat misinformation is with the truth," Swift said.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US forces on Friday hit 15 targets in Huthi-controlled areas of Yemen, the US military said.</p>

<p>Four provinces were struck, the Iran-backed rebels' Al Masirah television network reported.</p>

<p>The United States and Britain have repeatedly carried out strikes aimed at curbing the Huthis' ability to target shipping, but the rebels' attacks on merchant vessels transiting the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden have persisted.</p>

<p>"US Central Command (CENTCOM) forces conducted strikes on 15 Huthi targets in Iranian-backed Huthi-controlled areas of Yemen today," the military command responsible for US forces in the Middle East said on social media.</p>

<p>"These targets included Huthi offensive military capabilities," CENTCOM said, adding that the strikes were carried out "to protect freedom of navigation and make international waters safer and more secure for US, coalition, and &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; merchant vessels."</p>

<p>Al Masirah -- which said both the United States and Britain struck Yemen on Friday -- had earlier reported four strikes on Sanaa and seven on Hodeida. AFP correspondents heard loud explosions in both cities.</p>

<p>At least one strike each hit Dhamar, south of the capital, and Mukayras, southeast of Sanaa, Al Masirah said.</p>

<p>The Huthis have been hitting shipping since November, saying that attacks, which have disrupted maritime traffic in a globally important waterway, target vessels linked to Israel and are intended to signal solidarity with Palestinians during the Gaza war.</p>

<p>- Huthi attacks on Israel -</p>

<p>Israel has also struck Yemen in response to Huthi attacks. Israeli strikes on Hodeida last month killed at least five people after the rebels said they had targeted Israel's Ben Gurion Airport with a missile.</p>

<p>The US strikes took place a day after the rebels said they carried out a drone attack on Tel Aviv. The Israeli military said it had intercepted "a suspicious aerial target" overnight off central Israel, without giving further details.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, the Huthis said they had fired cruise missiles at Israel, following Iran's massive bombardment of the country.</p>

<p>The day before, the Huthis damaged two ships in separate attacks off Yemen's coast.</p>

<p>One ship was hit by a marine drone, puncturing a ballast tank, while a second vessel was damaged by a missile less than three hours later, the United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) said.</p>

<p>The Huthis, who have controlled large swaths of war-torn Yemen for a decade, are part of the "axis of resistance" of Iran-linked groups arrayed against Israel and the United States.</p>

<p>The latest strikes came as thousands of people took to the streets of the capital Sanaa to express solidarity with Palestinians and Lebanese amid attacks by Israel.</p>

<p>"The aggression on the capital and Yemeni governorates after the...solidarity marches with Lebanon and Gaza is a desperate attempt to terrorize our people," Huthi official Hashem Sharaf al-Din told Al Masirah.</p>

<p>"Yemen will not be deterred by these attacks and will continue its steadfastness in confronting the enemies with all its strength," he said.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[President Joe Biden on Friday urged Israel against striking Iran's oil facilities, a day after he said the United States was discussing the possibility of such strikes with its ally.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;President Joe Biden said on Friday he would think about alternatives to striking Iranian oil fields if he were in Israel's shoes, adding he thinks Israel has not yet concluded how to respond to Iran.</p>

<p>"The Israelis have not concluded what they are going to do in terms of a strike. That's under discussion," Biden said in remarks to reporters at a White House press briefing.</p>

<p>"If I were in their shoes, I'd be thinking about other alternatives than striking oilfields," the president added.</p>

<p>Tensions between Iran and Israel have been high as Israel has been weighing options to respond to Tehran's ballistic missile attack on Tuesday, which Iran had carried out in response to Israel's military action in Lebanon.</p>

<p>Biden was also asked if he thought that by not engaging in diplomacy, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was trying to influence the Nov. 5 U.S. election in which Republican former President Donald Trump faces Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris.</p>

<p>"Whether he is trying to influence the election, I don't know but I am not counting on that," Biden said in response. "No administration has done more to help Israel than I have."</p>

<p>The latest bloodshed in the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict was triggered by Palestinian Hamas militants' Oct. 7, 2023, attack that killed 1,200 and in which about 250 were taken as hostages, according to Israeli tallies.</p>

<p>Israel's subsequent assault on Hamas-governed Gaza has killed over 41,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's health ministry, and displaced nearly Gaza's entire population, caused a hunger crisis and led to genocide allegations that Israel denies.</p>

<p>Israel's recent military action in Lebanon has killed hundreds, wounded thousands and displaced over a million. Israel says it is targeting Lebanese Iran-backed Hezbollah militants.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A court trying a French man charged with enlisting dozens of strangers to rape his heavily drugged wife ruled on Friday that the public could be present when video evidence is screened, reversing an earlier decision.</p>

<p>Lawyers for the victim, Gisele Pelicot -- ex-wife of the main accused, Dominique Pelicot -- hailed as a "victory" the ruling announced by judge Roger Arata.</p>

<p>The screening of images will be preceded by an "announcement allowing people of a sensitive disposition and minors to leave the courtroom," the judge added.</p>

<p>Since the trial started on September 2, the court in the southern city of Avignon has been reserved for members of the court, the parties and the press.</p>

<p>The public has been assigned to an adjoining room where proceedings are screened live.</p>

<p>The screening of video evidence will, however, "not be systematic" and will only take place when it is "strictly necessary for exposing the truth" at the request of one of the parties, added Arata.</p>

<p>Dominque Pelicot filmed much of the abuse against his wife and also took meticulous records of the strangers visiting the family home, unwittingly helping police uncover the crimes.</p>

<p>He was intially investigated when he was caught taking pictures up women's skirts in a supermarket in 2020.</p>

<p>Last month the judge banned the broadcast of images in the presence of the public and the press, saying: "Considering that these images are indecent and shocking, this will only be done in the presence of the parties to the trial and the court."</p>

<p>But lawyers for Gisele Pelicot -- who has insisted on the trial being open to the public to draw attention to the use of drugs to commit sexual abuse -- called for the lifting of the restrictions.</p>

<p>- 'Find meaning in suffering' -</p>

<p>The ruling is a "victory" but "a victory in a fight that should not have been fought," said lawyer Stephane Babonneau, arguing that French law has granted rape victims for over 40 years the right to decide whether or not the proceedings should be public.</p>

<p>Gisele Pelicot's willingness to highlight her suffering has won widespread praise and made her a feminist icon in France.</p>

<p>"For Gisele Pelicot, it is too late. The harm is done," said Babonneau.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"But if these same hearings, through their publicity, help prevent other women from having to go through this, then she will find meaning in her suffering.".</p>

<p>The trial, which is due to last until December, is currently hearing testimony from the other men facing charges of responding to Dominique Pelicot's call and raping Gisele Pelicot.</p>

<p>Forty-nine other men are accused of raping or attempting to rape Gisele Pelicot. Another has admitted to sedating his own spouse so that he and Dominique Pelicot could sexually assault her.</p>

<p>Some lawyers for the other 50 accused strongly opposed the screening of video evidence.</p>

<p>"Justice does not need that in order to proceed, what is the point of these revolting screenings?" said lawyer Olivier Lantelme.</p>

<p>"We do not have to move from a popular tribunal in the name of the French people to a tribunal of the crowd," added Paul-Roger Gontard.</p>

<p>But for Antoine Camus, another lawyer in Gisele Pelicot's team, these videos "cause the argument of accidental rape to collapse".&nbsp;</p>

<p>"They show that these were opportunistic rapes and, beyond that, it was a question of degrading, humiliating, and sullying, it was in reality a question of hatred of women.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"No one (among the defendants) denounced what was happening, each contributed in their own small way to this banality of rape, to this banality of evil", he added.</p>

<p>Beatrice Zavarro, Dominique Pelicot's lawyer, who had previously backed the screening of the videos, did not express an opinion on the issue on Friday.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Israel's invasion of Lebanon this week and Iran's missile attack on its regional foe, all while war rages on in Gaza, have heightened the risk of a high-intensity conflict across the Middle East.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel's invasion of Lebanon this week and Iran's missile attack on its regional foe, all while war rages on in Gaza, have heightened the risk of a high-intensity conflict across the Middle East.</p>

<p>The spiralling violence now threatens to engulf more and more of the region despite diplomatic efforts to calm tensions, with UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warning of a "sickening cycle of escalation after escalation".</p>

<p>AFP spoke to analysts to assess what could happen next:</p>

<p><strong>- Will Israel retaliate? -</strong></p>

<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu swiftly condemned the launch of some 200 missiles at his country on Tuesday, declaring: "Iran made a big mistake tonight and will pay for it."</p>

<p>David Khalfa, a Middle East expert at the Jean-Jaures Foundation, a Paris-based think-tank, said Israel has little choice but to respond to the Iranian attack "because of the scale and the fact that the nature of the targets has changed" to include sensitive military sites.</p>

<p>It was the second time Iran directly attacked Israel. In April, a barrage of around 300 drones and missiles triggered a measured Israeli retaliation that saw a single Iranian air defence radar installation destroyed.</p>

<p>The response this time is expected to be of far greater magnitude, according to analysts.</p>

<p>With many Israelis celebrating the Jewish New Year this week, the holidays may "not be a good time to retaliate", said Danny Citrinowicz, an Iran specialist at the Institute for National Security Studies (INSS) in Tel Aviv.</p>

<p>"But I don't think it will take much time," he said.</p>

<p><strong>- What are Israel's options? -</strong></p>

<p>Since the Iranian attack, Israeli officials have argued there was a potential "historic opportunity to decisively deal with the Iranian regime", according to Khalfa.</p>

<p>Former prime minister, Naftali Bennett, was one of the first to call for an attack on Iranian nuclear facilities, which Israel regards as an existential threat.</p>

<p>But the most sensitive equipment is believed to be buried deep underground where Israel may be unable to hit.</p>

<p>US President Joe Biden has advised against even trying, urging Israel to respond "in proportion" -- although Netanyahu has often ignored his guidance in the past.</p>

<p>Other possible Israeli responses include targeted assassinations, strikes on Iranian industrial sites or cyberattacks, according to experts and Israeli media reports.</p>

<p>Biden has also mentioned ongoing discussions about potential strikes on Iranian oil infrastructure, which sent prices for crude spiking on Thursday.</p>

<p>Khalfa said that after decades of tension, Israel and Iran are now "no longer in a low-intensity confrontation but an open war", which could evolve into a "regional war of attrition".</p>

<p><strong>- Do Iran and Israel want war? -&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Iran has "already thought things through, to some extent at least. They are ready," said Citrinowicz, suggesting that Tehran's response to any Israeli retaliation would be "swift".</p>

<p>Sima Shine, another Iran expert at the INSS, said that the Islamic republic possessed "undeniable" destructive capabilities.</p>

<p>"They can launch more than 200, or even 300 missiles, and they also have drones," she said, while also warning about "terrorist operations abroad" that could include attacks on Israeli diplomatic missions or Jewish community centres.</p>

<p>"Everything right now hinges on Israel's response, whether it escalates into a regional war," said Sina Toossi, a senior fellow at the Center for International Policy in Washington.</p>

<p>Both Netanyahu and Iran were "taking huge gambles", he said.</p>

<p>And with each escalation, the risks increase.</p>

<p>However, both Iran and Israel have repeatedly insisted that they do not want to be drawn into a spiral of retaliatory violence.</p>

<p>Israel is already engaged on several military fronts.</p>

<p>In the Gaza Strip, the military is fighting Hamas, aiming to rescue the 97 hostages taken on October 7 who are still held there.</p>

<p>In Lebanon, after days of air strikes against Hezbollah, troops are now battling the Iran-backed militants on the ground.</p>

<p>And elsewhere in the region, Israel confronts armed groups like Yemen's Huthi rebels who have increased their missile and drone attacks.</p>

<p>Ultimately, Citrinowicz said, both Iran and Israel "will look for a political solution" that may be supported by the United States and France, whose influence particularly in Lebanon could play a critical role in restoring calm.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump's expected foreign policy towards Europe during his second term will have far-reaching, and possibly, grave consequences.</p>

<p>At the end of last week, journalist <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/donald-trump-kamala-harris-jd-vance-tim-waltz-eu-nato-us-elections-weapons/">Nicholas Vincour</a> suggested that the decades-long close Europe-American relationship was about to be over, whoever won the White House. And that Europeans should worry less about the presidency and “more about how Europe can hack it alone on a dangerous global stage”. Yesterday's dismissible cynicism over declining American commitment in Europe is today's cautionary tale. But with Trump as president that concern deepens considerably, particularly over trade and defence.</p>

<p>In his first presidency Trump unleashed a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/business/timeline-key-dates-in-the-us-china-trade-war-idUSKBN1ZE1AA/">battery of tariffs</a>, tit for tats and trade wars with states, companies and regions including the EU. That trend is set to continue, if Trump's <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/11/6/asia-braces-for-disruption-to-alliances-trade-after-trumps-victory">campaign promises are to be believed</a>, including imposing 10-20% <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-trade-war-donald-trump-elections-triumphs-board-tariffs-transatlantic-relations/">tariffs on all imports</a>, with a particular focus on key states such as Germany and key companies including <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/nov/06/german-carmakers-shares-slump-fear-trump-tariffs">Mercedes-Benz</a>.</p>

<p>Trump's stated preference is to reset the supply chains <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFskg98w204">to US advantage</a>, either through eye-wateringly high <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uk-economy-risks-big-hit-under-trump-tariffs-plan-think-tank-says-2024-11-06/">tariffs</a> or ensuring greater post-manufacture assembly of foreign goods in the US. These are high stakes indeed. The US is the EU's biggest trade partner, with ever-increasing volumes of <a href="https://policy.trade.ec.europa.eu/eu-trade-relationships-country-and-region/countries-and-regions/united-states_en">goods and services</a> being purchased.</p>

<h2>Is Europe prepared?</h2>

<p>Not only has the European Commission been sharpening its teeth on a number of trade, tech, AI and investment-related mechanisms designed to keep <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/regulatory-framework-ai#:%7E:text=The%20AI%20Act%20is%20the%20first%2Dever%20comprehensive%20legal%20framework,powerful%20and%20impactful%20AI%20models">Trump-upmanship</a> at bay. But the highly anticipated trade war has already <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/business-economy-euro/european-semester_en">been prepared for</a>, at least in terms of protecting the EU's financial interests.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.eesc.europa.eu">European Commission</a> is focused on increasing the EU's overall self-sufficiency in big tech, including climate tech and raw materials. This will likely invite arguments with the US, as well as unresolved arguments over steel.</p>

<p>Trump's antipathy to Europe isn't new. And it isn't entirely personal. Washington is no longer populated with policy makers with a natural empathy to, or even personal connections with, Europe. Even under presidents <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/what-will-define-barack-obamas-european-legacy-eu-us/">Barack Obama</a> and Joe Biden, Washington shifted clearly, and possibly permanently, away from both Europe <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/11/05/trump-win-nato-european-defense/">and Nato</a> and towards Asia</p>

<p>Whether via <a href="https://warontherocks.com/2024/09/u-s-troop-withdrawals-from-europe-wont-benefit-its-rivals/">reduced troop levels</a> or diminished diplomatic interest in Europe among officials in the State Department, <a href="https://carnegieendowment.org/posts/2024/04/the-united-states-stepping-back-from-europe-is-a-matter-of-when-not-whether?lang=en">US attitudes to Europe</a> range from indifferent at best, to hostile at worst.</p>

<p>The US has moved from post-cold war levels of cooperation in 1994 <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/donald-trump-kamala-harris-jd-vance-tim-waltz-eu-nato-us-elections-weapons/">to pivot towards Asia</a> in the 2000s. Now, accelerated by entrenched partisanship, isolationism and Trump's second win, Washington remains content with <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/donald-trump-kamala-harris-jd-vance-tim-waltz-eu-nato-us-elections-weapons/">the ongoing</a> “downgrading of Europe in the psyche of American elites”.</p>

<p>This despite (<a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/donald-trump-kamala-harris-jd-vance-tim-waltz-eu-nato-us-elections-weapons/">as argued</a> by retired US Army officer and former commanding general Ben Hodges) critically reducing the “huge advantage we [the US] have with our leadership inside NATO and our relationship with European countries”. As president, Trump is simply going to accelerate this trend.</p>

<h2>In the Baltics</h2>

<p>Among Baltic countries there is already an expectation that Trump will push European states for <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-23/trump-advisers-push-even-higher-target-for-nato-defense-spending?embedded-checkout=true">higher defence</a> spending. However, in the eyes of some, Trump's demand is not a bad thing in and of itself.</p>

<p>As Tallinn-based International Center for Defense and Security director Indrek Kannik <a href="https://news.err.ee/1609513435/expert-joe-biden-will-be-remembered-as-a-weak-president-on-foreign-policy">argues</a>: “If the US spends 3.5 to 4 percent on security, while Europe only spends 1.5 to 2 percent, it's an imbalance.”</p>

<p>Kannick's suggestion that “Europe will gradually assume more responsibility for its defense” echoes perspectives increasingly advocated in Brussels itself. In effect: now is the time for Europe to acknowledge finally its lacklustre, scattered approach to defence coordination.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/donald-trump-eu-officials-china-union-policy-kamala-harris-medicine-ukraine-defense/">Others fear</a> that Trump 2.0 “would be so hostile to Europe … that the bloc would have no choice but to bolster its defense spending”.</p>

<p>For the Baltics, the question of improving defence coordination and sorting out financing is vital in tackling the threat of a territory-hungry Putin on its borders.</p>

<h2>Wake up, Nato?</h2>

<p>Last time around, Trump was fiercely critical of Nato, largely because the US provides <a href="https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_67655.htm">the largest portion</a> of defence spending. Trump's view in 2016 was that this encouraged free-riding among other members, happy to contribute less at the US's expense.</p>

<p>This time, Trump has ramped up his criticism that Nato allies are still failing to spend enough. This in turn has spurred Trump to <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/closer-trumps-years-criticizing-nato-defense-spending/story?id=107201586">suggest</a> that he would “encourage” Russia “to do whatever the hell they want” to Nato allies who fail to pay their bill.</p>

<p>This leaves open the question of whether the US itself would defend another member in the event of an attack, or even leave the organisation.</p>

<figure><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QvcikCxCNxE?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0" width="650"></iframe>

<figcaption><span class="caption">Sweden recently joined Nato and is concerned about an expansionist Russia.</span></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Trump's options regarding Ukraine are simple: either arm it, or deny it aid. The former risks freezing battle lines and forcing an imperfect peace on Ukraine, the latter gives Russia's President Vladimir Putin a satisfactory victory, bringing an aggressive Russia to the very doorstep of the EU and Nato.</p>

<p>This is particularly worrying for Baltic states: with Ukraine overpowered, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/19ef9629-805f-49aa-81bc-54c84240b733">the eastern flank</a> of the EU and Nato would be exposed, which in turn would destabilise European collective security.</p>

<p>From a foreign policy perspective, the frustration is that European decision makers simply cannot be sure of what Trump will actually do next. As journalist <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/world/us/2024/10/10/the-biggest-drag-on-us-power-is-that-it-keeps-changing-its-mind/">Janan Ganesh recently observed</a>, the US “at its peak had more going for it than overwhelming strength. It had a certain amount of predictability. Without either, its purchase on events can't be the same”.</p>

<h2>Friends in some places</h2>

<p>Trump's victory will be warmly welcomed by some Europeans, particularly those from <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/clyvglq47y9o">far-right parties</a> who will now be confident in a White House that shares their ideological approaches. Similarly, Trump may even lend active support to far-right governments in Hungary and Italy.</p>

<p>There are opportunities aplenty. <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/hungary-pm-viktor-orban-donald-trump-win-us-elections-2024/?utm_source=email&amp;utm_medium=alert&amp;utm_campaign=Trump%20win%20is%20%E2%80%98in%20the%20bag%2C%E2%80%99%20Orb%C3%A1n%20gloats">Hungary's prime minister Viktor Orbán</a> has spent years personally cultivating a deep connection with Trump and Maga-Republicans. And Italy's prime minister Giorgia Meloni could continue the same balancing act she has within the EU on key issues including immigration.</p>

<p>Others, like the UK and the European Commission, are going to have to play either the pragmatist card, or be prepared to hit back, and hit hard against everything from isolationist tariffs to vanishing defence commitments.<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Women in Afghanistan are not forbidden from speaking to each other, the Taliban government's morality ministry told AFP on Saturday, denying recent media reports of a ban.</p>

<p>Afghan media based outside the country and international outlets have in recent weeks reported a ban on women hearing other women's voices, based on an audio recording of the head of the Ministry for the Propagation of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice (PVPV), Mohammad Khalid Hanafi, about rules of prayer.&nbsp;</p>

<p>PVPV spokesman Saiful Islam Khyber said the reports were "brainless" and "illogical", in a voice recording confirmed by AFP.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"A woman can talk to another woman, women need to interact with one another in society, women do have their needs," he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He added, however, that there were exceptions according to Islamic law, such as those described by Hanafi that women should use hand gestures instead of raising their voices to communicate with other women while praying.</p>

<p>Women in Afghanistan are barred from singing or reciting poetry aloud in public, according to a recent "vice and virtue" law detailing sweeping codes of behaviour, including that women's voices should be "concealed" along with their bodies when outside their homes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Women's voices have also been banned from television and radio broadcasts in some provinces.</p>

<p>The law codified many rules the Taliban government has imposed based on their strict interpretation of Islamic law since they came to power in 2021, with women bearing the brunt of restrictions the United Nations has called "gender apartheid".&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Taliban authorities have banned education after secondary school for girls and women, also barring them from various jobs as well as parks and other public places.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Taliban government has said all Afghan citizens' rights are guaranteed under Islamic law.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few minutes after I took my seat at an advanced screening of Amazon Prime's Brian Epstein biopic, Midas Man, I found myself engaged in Beatles chat with the chap next to me. I wasn't surprised to find a fellow Fab Four fanatic at such an event. But I was surprised when I realised I was speaking with the legendary presenter <a href="https://www.rocksbackpages.com/Library/Writer/paul-gambaccini">Paul Gambaccini</a>, a man who, I was soon to discover, met not only John, Paul, George and Ringo, but also original drummer Pete Best and bassist Stuart Sutcliffe's sister. Or “five and a half Beatles”, as he put it.</p>

<p>As the lights went down and we readied ourselves, Gambaccini whispered that he hoped this wasn't going to be “another Beatles film with no Beatles music in it”. The subject of soundtracks in Beatles biopics has always been an elephant in the room among fans, and Midas Man, like Backbeat (1994), In His Life: The John Lennon Story (2000), Lennon Naked (2010) and many others before it, did indeed lack any Lennon and McCartney (or Harrison) originals.</p>

<p>But, given that it cost the 2019 film Yesterday US$10 million (£7.7 million) to <a href="https://www.nme.com/features/beatles-biopics-ranked-2869762">acquire the rights to use the Beatles' music</a> (40% of the entire budget), this shouldn't really come as a surprise. And there aren't any crafty ways round it, either. This much we know from the fate of 1979's Birth of The Beatles which <a href="https://www.nme.com/features/beatles-biopics-ranked-2869762">has been prevented from reissue</a> due to its unauthorised use of songs.</p>

<p>Midas Man tells the story of the legendary Beatles manager, Brian Epstein. The film follows Epstein, played by Jacob Fortune-Lloyd, from his days as the unfulfilled manager of a furniture and musical instrument shop to making good on his promise that his unknown and unsigned band, The Beatles, would one day be “bigger than Elvis”.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.msn.com/en-gb/entertainment/music/midas-man-a-flimsy-portrait-of-the-man-who-discovered-the-beatles/ar-AA1tcOBd">Some reviews</a> have taken issue at how the film shows Epstein one minute suavely cajoling American TV host Ed Sullivan, and the next falling to pieces after the death of his father. But such contradictions of character were exactly what made Epstein who he was – a man <a href="https://mrepstein.tumblr.com/post/670711046215008256/the-fifth-beatles-double-life-the-sunday-times">Beatles biographer Craig Brown</a> has described as alternatively lonely, businesslike, scrupulous, obsessive, shrewd, awkward and pernickety.</p>

<p>For me, it's Epstein's complexity that makes him so endearing, both in real life and in Midas Man. Fortune-Lloyd expertly and realistically portrays him as confident in his abilities, but also on the cusp of being consumed by self-doubt at any moment. He also carries off the magnetic charm that led Epstein on his scarcely believable journey from selling pianos in his family shop to one of the most powerful people in the entertainment industry within the space of a few years.</p>

<figcaption><span class="caption">The trailer for Midas Man.</span></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In what is ultimately a tragic story of a troubled life, it's unsurprising that there are plenty of tearjerker moments. But screenwriters Brigit Grant and Jonathan Wakeham avoid the temptation to overdo the pathos, choosing subtlety over the sledgehammer.</p>

<p>A combination of this and Fortune-Lloyd's understated acting lead to several poignant moments in the film. Epstein yearns to be a part of the band's world, but is kept on the sidelines due to his position of authority, (perceived) difference in class and, most importantly, his own social awkwardness.</p>

<h2>Being Brian</h2>

<p>The film's sets are a highlight throughout, from 1960s Liverpool's unique blend of vibrancy and poverty to the glitz and glamour of New York. The North End Music Store (NEMs) where Epstein worked and which became his management company, thrums with the energy and anticipation of the tectonic shift in culture that's just around the corner. And I've scarcely experienced a more immersive recreation of The Beatles's lunchtime performances at The Cavern.</p>

<p>Alongside Fortune-Lloyd's nuanced performance, there were several other standouts. Leo Harvey-Elledge provides much of the humour as George Harrison, Darci Shaw has a whale of a time as an effervescent Cilla Black, and the consistently excellent Eddie Marsan and Emily Watson are perfectly cast (although somewhat underused) as Epstein's parents.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Leo Harvey Elledge as George Harrison in Midas Man.

Signature" /></div>

<p class="ins_instory_dv_caption"><em><small>Leo Harvey Elledge as George Harrison in Midas Man. Signature</small></em></p>
</div>

<p>Good as the overall casting is, however, it's hard to see Fortune-Lloyd's Epstein as only six years senior to Jonah Lees's John Lennon. As versatile as the former is, he looks significantly older than Epstein's 27 years – the age he was when he first saw The Beatles perform at The Cavern in 1961.</p>

<p>This may seem like a minor point, but it affects the dynamic between him and the band, which, combined with the significant height difference between Fortune Lloyd (6ft 2) and Lees (5ft 8) gives a sense of authority that was more representative of The Beatles' producer, George Martin.</p>

<p>The decision to make John “Tex” Ellington (Ed Speleers) such a major character is also a bit of a surprise, as, although based on a real person, the role he played in Epstein's life is much-debated among Beatle historians. But the inclusion of this turbulent love affair did admittedly add another dimension to Epstein's characterisation.</p>

<p>With the exception of this, perhaps, there's nothing in Midas Man that die-hard Beatles fans didn't already know about Epstein. But given that he and The Beatles are part of what's been called <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/sep/20/beatles-films-midas-man-paul-mccartney-one-hand-clapping-let-it-be">“the greatest story ever told”</a>, that's not necessarily a bad thing.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Days after his win in the US Presidential elections, Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate security has been upgraded with a robotic dog. The mechanical canine was spotted patrolling the estate in Palm Beach, Florida, early on November 8, adding a futuristic layer to the estate's security measures.</p>

<p>According to<a href="http://https://nypost.com/2024/11/08/us-news/robot-dog-seen-patrolling-donald-trumps-mar-a-lago-estate/" rel="nofollow noindex"> The New York Post,</a> in videos, the robot dog, manufactured by Boston Dynamics, is seen moving along the grassy grounds, walking amid the palm trees surrounding the property. A warning label on its side reads, “DO NOT PET.”</p>

<p>The United States Secret Service confirmed the deployment of the robotic dog as part of its ongoing efforts to safeguard the President-elect. A spokesperson for the agency told New York Post, “Safeguarding the President-elect is a top priority. While we cannot get into the specific capabilities, the robotic dogs are equipped with surveillance technology, and an array of advanced sensors that support our protective operations.”</p>

<p>Trump, who survived two assassination attempts during his campaign, has been working on assembling his incoming administration at Mar-a-Lago following his victory over Kamala Harris.</p>

<p>Robotic dogs have become increasingly popular among public safety agencies across the US. They provide a way to keep law enforcement officers and first responders out of harm's way in dangerous situations. The New York Police Department (NYPD) unveiled a robotic K-9 unit dubbed “Digidogs,” announced by Mayor Eric Adams last year. Originally leased from Boston Dynamics, the robots were met with public criticism, with social media users drawing comparisons to something straight out of the dystopian series Black Mirror.</p>

<p>Beyond law enforcement, these robots have been deployed for more critical, life-saving roles. In the aftermath of a parking garage collapse in Lower Manhattan last year, one such robot dog was sent into the wreckage to search for survivors and assess the destruction.</p>

<p>The military has also found use for these advanced machines. Earlier this year, Ukraine's military deployed 30 robot dogs, each costing around $9,000, against Russian forces. The “metal pooches” served as reconnaissance units that could swiftly deliver supplies, reducing the risk to human soldiers on the front lines.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi on Saturday warned that the wars in Gaza and Lebanon, where Israel is battling Tehran-backed groups, could spill over beyond the Middle East.</p>

<p>"The world should know that in case of the expansion of war, its harmful effects will not be limited only to the West Asia region; insecurity and instability can spread to other regions, even far away," Araghchi said in speech aired on state TV.</p>

<p>Iran's arch-nemesis Israel has been waging a devastating war in the Gaza Strip against Iran-backed Palestinian militant group Hamas since it launched its shock attack on Israel in October 2023.</p>

<p>Israel has more recently shifted its focus to Lebanon, where it has been engaged in full-fledged battle since September with Hezbollah, a Lebanese militant group which is financially and militarily supported by the Islamic Republic.</p>

<p>On October 26, Israel conducted air strikes on military sites in Iran in response to Tehran's October 1 attack on Israel, itself retaliation for the killing of Iran-backed militant leaders and a Revolutionary Guards general.</p>

<p>Iranian officials said Israel's October 26 attack killed four soldiers and resulted in "limited damage" to radar systems. Iranian media also reported that a civilian was killed.</p>

<p>Tehran has since vowed to retaliate despite the US and Israel's warning against it.</p>

<p>Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian has maintained that a potential ceasefire in Gaza and Lebanon could affect Iran's response.</p>

<p>"If they (the Israelis)... accept a ceasefire and stop massacring the oppressed and innocent people of the region, it could affect the intensity and type of our response," Pezeshkian said early this month.</p>

<p>On Thursday, an adviser to Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei cautioned against an impulsive response to Israel.</p>

<p>"Israel aims to bring the conflict to Iran. We must act wisely to avoid its trap and not react instinctively," the adviser, Ali Larijani, told state television.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A former Hamas hostage has lambasted the United Nations and other advocacy groups for their inaction towards the plight of hostages still held in Gaza. During an address outside the United Nations Security Council in New York on November 6, Mia Shem expressed frustration over what she described as the UN's absence in seeking aid for those in captivity.<br />
<br />
“Not a single humanitarian agency saw me or treated me. Where was the Red Cross? Where was the UN demanding that they have access to us?” said Mia Shem, who was released in November 2023.<br />
<br />
The 22-year-old Israeli-French dual national detailed her harrowing experience marked by isolation, lack of medical treatment and intimidation by armed captors. She said, “For 50 days, I was kept alone, suffering from an unbearable pain in my hand, without any treatment. A Hamas terrorist sat in front of me in a dark room with a gun pointed at my head. Not a single humanitarian agency saw me or treated me even as my arm got worse.”</p>

<p>Shem also revealed how after her abduction she was held in a Palestinian home, where she endured harassment from an adult and taunts from a child. Speaking to Channel 12, she said, “There are no innocents in Gaza, not even one.”</p>

<p>Israel's UN Ambassador, Danny Danon, also spoke at the press conference, sharply criticising the UN's “complete moral failure.” He said the UN's silence on the issue was “unforgivable.”</p>

<p>According to a report in the <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/08/world-news/freed-hamas-hostage-mia-shem-says-un-hasnt-lifted-a-finger-to-help-remaining-captives/" rel="nofollow noindex">New York Post</a>, while the UN Security Council has issued statements urging Hamas to release Israeli hostages, no specific actions or sanctions have been proposed to enforce these demands.</p>

<p>The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has maintained that, as a neutral humanitarian body, it cannot adopt a strong public stance, although it has expressed a desire to visit Israeli captives.</p>

<p>In over a year-long Israeli onslaught in Gaza, over 43,000 Palestinians -- a vast majority of them kids and women -- have been killed. Almost the entire population of Gaza has been internally displaced, with people forced to move from one place to another as Israeli rockets target neighbourhoods, hospitals and even camps offering temporary refuge.</p>

<p>The Benjamin Netanyahu government's war in Gaza came as a retaliation to Hamas' October 7 attack on a music festival and parts of southern Israel. At least 1200 people were killed in the attack, and Hamas took another 254 people hostage.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump is preparing for his second term in the Oval Office. Days after he defeated Kamala Harris in the Presidential polls, political observers in the US speculated that Trump would issue pardons for several controversial figures. From January 6 rioters to prominent public figures, these potential pardons seem to be part of Trump's strategy to galvanise his political base and challenge what he views as a biased legal system.</p>

<p>According to the US Department of Justice, “The President's clemency power is conferred by Article II, Section 2, Clause 1 of the Constitution of the United States, which provides: ‘The President…shall have Power to grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offenses against the United States, except in Cases of Impeachment.'”</p>

<p>But pardons do not fully erase a criminal record. Even after a pardon, individuals may still face restrictions, such as being prohibited from voting in certain states.</p>

<h3><strong>Pardons for January 6 rioters</strong></h3>

<p>Trump has repeatedly expressed his intention to pardon those involved in the January 6 Capitol riots, though he remains vague on specifics. “If they're innocent, I would pardon them,” he remarked in July. Campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt told the<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/11/06/jan-6-defendants-trump-pardons/"> Washington Post</a> that pardons would be decided on a “case-by-case” basis, with some defendants already invoking Trump's pardon promises in court since his election on November 5.</p>

<h3><strong>Hunter Biden</strong></h3>

<p>Trump hinted at the possibility of pardoning Hunter Biden, Joe Biden's son, who faces sentencing for federal tax and gun charges. Trump told conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt in October, “I wouldn't take it off the books… despite what they've done to me.”</p>

<h3><strong>Ross Ulbricht</strong></h3>

<p>Another person who may benefit from a potential pardon is Ross Ulbricht, founder of the Silk Road dark web marketplace, who has received vocal support from libertarians. Supporters of Ulbricht, who was sentenced to life imprisonment in 2015 for running the Silk Road marketplace on the dark web, expressed their hope on social media, with one tweet stating, "ROSS IS COMING HOME IN JANUARY. We are so grateful to @realDonaldTrump for his pledge to #FreeRoss and to all those who have supported us.”</p>

<h3><strong>Julian Assange</strong></h3>

<p>Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, may also receive a pardon. Trump expressed in May 2024 that he would “give very serious consideration” to granting clemency to Assange.</p>

<h3><strong>Peter Navarro</strong></h3>

<p>Trump has left the door open for a potential pardon of his former trade adviser, Peter Navarro, who was sentenced to four months in prison for contempt of Congress. Trump praised Navarro as a “great patriot,” claiming he was “treated very unfairly.”</p>

<h3><strong>Trump's self-pardon and legal boundaries</strong></h3>

<p>As for the possibility of Trump pardoning himself, the issue remains murky. While Trump previously dismissed the idea, telling <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-unlikely-pardon-convicted-presidency-meet-the-press-rcna104779">NBC News </a>last year it was “very unlikely” he'd pardon himself, because he “didn't do anything wrong,” legal experts remain divided on whether the Constitution permitted such an action. While Trump may avoid needing a self-pardon for federal charges, state-level prosecutions, including those in New York and Georgia, remain outside his jurisdiction.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A team of astronomers has uncovered an Earth-like planet orbiting a star located 4,000 light years away from the solar system, potentially offering insights into Earth's distant future. The rocky planet, about the same mass as Earth, revolves around a white dwarf in the constellation Sagittarius.</p>

<p>The discovery brings a glimmer of hope for Earth's survival when our sun enters its final stages. It suggests that Earth could potentially avoid being consumed by the expanding sun, opening up possibilities for human migration to the outer solar system, with moons such as Europa, Callisto, and Ganymede around Jupiter, or Enceladus near Saturn, becoming possible havens for future generations.</p>

<h2><strong>What is a white dwarf?</strong></h2>

<p>A white dwarf is a star's remnant after it has run out of nuclear fuel and shed its outer layers. It symbolises the sun's eventual fate. The sun will grow into a red giant as its nuclear fuel runs out, then shrink to become a white dwarf. The extent of its expansion will determine which planets in the solar system will be engulfed - Mercury and Venus are likely to be consumed. But what about Earth?</p>

<p>In a study published in Nature Astronomy, researchers from the University of California, Berkeley, used the Keck Telescope in Hawaii to observe a system designated KMT-2020-BLG-0414. The system contains a white dwarf star with an Earth-sized planet in an orbit twice as far from the star as Earth is from the sun. Alongside the planet is a brown dwarf - a planet roughly 17 times the mass of Jupiter.</p>

<p>This finding supports the theory that as the sun expands into a red giant, its loss of mass will push the planets into more distant orbits. This phenomenon could allow Earth to escape destruction. Jessica Lu, an associate professor of astronomy at UC Berkeley, noted, "Whether life can survive on Earth through that (red giant) period is unknown. But certainly, the most important thing is that Earth isn't swallowed by the Sun when it becomes a red giant."</p>

<h2><strong>Future of Earth</strong></h2>

<p>"We do not currently have a consensus whether Earth could avoid being engulfed by the red giant sun in six billion years," said Keming Zhang, the lead author and a former doctoral student at the UC Berkeley, who is now an Eric and Wendy Schmidt AI in Science Postdoctoral fellow at UC San Diego.</p>

<p>"In any case, planet Earth will only be habitable for another billion years, at which point Earth's oceans would be vaporized by the runaway greenhouse effect-long before the risk of getting swallowed by the red giant." &nbsp;</p>

<p>Could humanity find refuge beyond Earth? As the sun swells into a red giant, the habitable zone in the solar system will shift outward to the orbits of Jupiter and Saturn. Many of their moons, such as Europa and Callisto, could become ocean worlds capable of supporting life. Zhang suggested, "Humanity could migrate out there."</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>As I walked out of my Upper West Side polling station in New York City after casting my vote, the lack of energy in America's most liberal city was palpable. The pins being sold just outside said “Keep Kamala and Carry On-a-la”, but the calmness was about to explode.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Donald Trump's stunning comeback forces an acknowledgement that Americans do not want to simply carry on. Much like India earlier this year. They are increasingly tired of the financial pain that started after the 2008 financial crisis, rendering many of them under-employed. The most powerful ingredients of rapid global economic growth in our lifetimes—globalisation and technological replacement—have ricocheted back to cause acute pain at the working-class Americans' dining tables. And they are hoping, against the odds, that their ballot can overpower that bullet.</p>

<p>This is precisely the reason why, much like the re-emergence of the former President, a defining trend is now categorising the American election cycle. And, I would argue, the Indian election cycle too.</p>

<h2><strong>Incumbents Beware</strong></h2>

<p>This is now the third presidential election since 2016 when the incumbent party has been voted out, a trend not seen since the 1970s when Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan were voted in quick succession as inflation eclipsed all else. Once is an accident. Twice, a coincidence. Three times, a pattern.</p>

<p>In India, the lack of a majority for the incumbent party this year was an indication of that very problem that is proving difficult for any global leader to resolve. In fact, there has been a dissipation of existing power if not an outright change in every major government across the world this year—from the UK and Italy to Germany and Japan, and others.</p>

<p>As Bill Clinton's political strategist Jim Carville stated prophetically thirty years ago, “It's the economy, stupid.” But some would point out that the stock markets are at an all-time high and economic growth was at par in both Trump and Biden years. So, why the discontent? Didn't life seem good enough?</p>

<p>Yes, but only for the elite, whether in the US or India. The elite are the real beneficiaries of the riches-to-riches story. How long can you ignore the larger population that now has to work an average of 2.5 jobs to keep the same lifestyle as a decade ago? In the case of India, too, yes there are cheap mobile phones and food handouts, but job prospects cannot keep up with young aspirations.</p>

<p>In this discontented mix, a message like Trump's, which primarily centres around inflation and its many symptoms—immigration being an obvious one—will obviously be attractive. But so is that of any politician who offers a change in the existing status quo. It is akin to a company changing multiple CEOs in the hope its fortunes will change, not realising that the problem lies in the product itself.</p>

<h2><strong>The Polarisation Card Is Losing Its Edge&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p>This election has broken several myths—the overriding one being polarisation—including that echo chambers are permanent and defined and will not sway voters from their trenches. That certainly was the case in 2016, when Trump's winnability was attributed to a fringe base of non-college-educated men. But in 2024, Trump's winnability is attributed to virtually all subsets.</p>

<p>A case in point is young men, and shockingly for the democrats, young men of colour—whether Latino or Indian-American—swinging in Trump's favour. The Left is finally realizing that they cannot club all minorities together, much like the Right in India is realizing the majority cannot always be a single voting bloc. Their loyalty, and more importantly, their ethics, are being questioned. I disagree. This was not a vote for the messenger, it was a vote for the message.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This election has stuck a needle into the bubble of polarisation that the world has sworn by throughout the last decade. Both sides tried to polarise voters, whether it was Trump with immigration or Harris with abortion. But it did not work. There are voters who have chosen Trump and abortion rights. The choice is no longer binary. Above all else, the voters in America are pragmatic.</p>

<p>The same is true for India. The 2024 India voting reflected the discontent among ordinary voters, where the economy superseded everything else. The conservative argument of caste or religious lines shaping voting patterns is increasingly becoming redundant.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As it has long been said, democracy is a luxury when there is not enough food on the table. But there are also similarities between the out-of-touch ‘Khan market gang' in India and America's coastal elite. Instead of focusing on the real issue of voter pain, the Democrats' and the Indian Opposition's patronising tone of ‘How could you vote for him?' reeked of moral superiority borne out of privilege, not realism.</p>

<h2><strong>Only Betting Markets Got It Right &nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p>The media and the pollsters have got it so far wrong that they are in danger of losing their voice. These echo chambers are now functioning as cheerleaders of political thought. They dole out a narrative rather than acting as arbiters of reason. It is ironic that the most truthful picture came from sources that are often the most tainted in history—the betting markets in the US and the satta bazaar in India. Whether Trump's sweep or the Bharatiya Janata Party's (BJP) underperformance, they were the only ones who got it right.</p>

<h2><strong>Kamala Played Well</strong></h2>

<p>Kamala Harris also emerged as a hero to many. Clearly, many things that were out of her control went wrong for her: Biden's selfishness in holding on to power, the war fatigue, and the all-important anti-incumbency.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When my 10-year-old daughter accompanying me to the voting booth asked me why a woman gets passed yet again for the most powerful job in the world, I told her to walk tall the next day. Because in the shortest presidential campaign in American history, of only 107 days, Kamala managed to achieve the impossible and did better than any reasonable hope. LOTUS for POTUS simply did not have enough time to bloom.</p>

<p>I do not think America acted like it did in 2016 and chose to vote against a female President. The pain threshold that Trump pressed on was much lower on Maslow's needs chart for the gender ceiling in American politics to even be a conversation. A famous meme from the Kamala campaign was a father going with his daughter to the polling booth and saying he was voting for her. I believe the father did still vote for his daughter, not necessarily as a mark of support for the candidate but as an act of hope of providing his family with a better life.</p>

<h2><strong>Trump Needs A Hail Mary&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p>But will Trump be able to deliver on that hope? In the America of the 1980s, the Republican party's modern hero, Ronald Reagan, achieved the impossible as he took on the structural inflation problem, giving birth to decades of prosperity.</p>

<p>For Trump to leave the legacy he wants, he will have to be in offensive tackle mode for the next four years and deliver a magical Reaganesque solution to the working class pain. Or else, given the musical chairs game global politics has become, the Dems will be back in the White House in 2028.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[The astronauts, who spent months aboard the ISS, faced a brief and unexpected hospitalisation after their return]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Three NASA astronauts, who recently returned to Earth after a 235-day stay in space, have shed light on the challenges of readjusting to gravity and life on the planet. Matthew Dominick, Michael Barratt and Jeanette Epps returned to Earth on October 25 aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule. During a NASA conference, they discussed the physical toll the mission had on their bodies.<br />
<br />
Dominick, a first-time space traveller and mission commander, revealed that while he expected dizziness and disorientation upon returning to Earth's gravity, some of the smaller struggles took him by surprise. “The big things you expect — being disoriented, being dizzy. But the little things like just sitting in a hard chair … My backside has not really sat on a hard thing for (235) days.” He also shared an amusing anecdote from a recent dinner with his family, where he found himself lying on a towel in the yard due to the discomfort of sitting.<br />
<br />
Epps, reflecting on the physical changes she faced, noted the unexpected weight and heaviness of objects once she returned to Earth. “The weight and the heaviness of things just is surprising, (I've been) laying any chance I got. But you have to move, and you have to exercise every day, otherwise you won't get those gains. You have to move regardless of how exhausted you feel,” she said.<br />
<br />
The astronauts, who spent months aboard the ISS, faced a brief and unexpected hospitalisation after their return. While NASA confirmed that all crew members were taken to Ascension Sacred Heart Pensacola “out of an abundance of caution,” details surrounding the medical issue, which led to one astronaut staying overnight at the hospital, have not been made public.<br />
<br />
Dominick, Barratt, Epps, and Russian cosmonaut Alexander Grebenkin, who also participated in the mission, were originally scheduled to return home earlier, but their return was delayed by scheduling conflicts with other spacecraft and weather conditions. The Crew-8 astronauts' mission duration was extended by a few weeks due to these unforeseen delays.<br />
<br />
Barratt, a medical doctor and veteran astronaut, stressed the importance of medical privacy concerning the situation. "Medical privacy and the processes we have going on right now negate our ability to (discuss the issue),” he said during the press conference.<br />
<br />
According to <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/08/science/spacex-nasa-crew-8-astronauts-update/index.html">CNN</a>, medical checkups are routine after extended space missions. But astronauts are usually transported back to their base in Houston for reconditioning following splashdown, allowing them to transition back to Earth's gravity.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Canada on Friday discontinued its Student Direct Stream (SDS) visa program for international students, amid a push by the country to cope with its housing and resource crisis.</p>

<p>The program was implemented in 2018 by the Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) to expedite study permit applications for international students from 14 countries, including Brazil, China, Colombia, Costa Rica, India, Morocco, Pakistan, Peru, Philippines and Vietnam. The g<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/news/notices/end-student-direct-stream-nigeria-student-express.html">overnment of Canada</a> said on its website that the initiative is being discontinued to "strengthen program integrity, address student vulnerability, and give all students equal and fair access to the application process".</p>

<p>Applications received till 2 pm ET on November 8 under the scheme will be processed, whereas all applications after this will be processed under the regular study permit stream.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The program had higher approval rates and faster processing times. With the discontinuation of this program, students from India and 13 other countries will have to undergo more lengthy visa processes.</p>

<p>Canada is looking to sharply lower the number of immigrants it allows into the country for the first time in years, in a dramatic policy change for an unpopular government trying to hang on to power.</p>

<p>A country that has long prided itself on welcoming newcomers, Canada is now moving the rhetoric towards migrants leading to a housing crisis, from rising cost of living to a strained healthcare system.</p>

<p>The issue has become one of the most contentious in Canadian politics with a federal election due no later than October 2025. Polls show a growing share of the population thinks Canada has too many immigrants.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A suspected suicide blast by an ethnic militant group rocked a crowded railway station in Pakistan's restive Balochistan region this morning, killing 25 people and injuring 46 others. The victims included at least 14 soldiers, the police said. CCTV footage showed dozens of people waiting on the platform when the blast ripped through Quetta's main railway station.</p>

<p>Bodies were seen scattered across the platform and the roof was blown away. There was blood everywhere as rescue workers went through abandoned luggage to find survivors.</p>

<p>The blast occurred when the Jaffer express was about to depart for Peshawar, said a senior police official, adding that it seemed to be a suicide blast. Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), an ethnic militant group in the region, has claimed responsibility for the blast.</p>

<p>Reports suggest the explosion occurred at the railway station's booking office. Law enforcement teams immediately secured the area and took the injured to the civil hospital in Quetta, said the provincial government spokesperson Shahid Rind.</p>

<p>Officials said at least 46 injured were brought to the hospital in the aftermath of the blast. The hospital declared an emergency and called additional staff to attend the injured.</p>

<p>"The blast targeted army personnel from the Infantry School," said Mouzzam Jah Ansari, the Inspector General of Police in Balochistan.</p>

<p>Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti has ordered an immediate probe and condemned the attack as "a horrific act" that targeted innocent civilians. "The terrorists' target now are innocent people, labourers, children, and women. Those targeting innocent people do not deserve mercy," Dawn quoted him as saying.</p>

<p>The blast comes as Pakistan grapples with a rise in terror attacks by ethnic militant groups. Nearly three months ago, a wave of attacks on police stations and highways in Balochistan claimed at least 73 lives.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Farhad Shakeri, an Afghan national who was deported from the United States in 2008, has been accused of plotting to assassinate Donald Trump.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Farhad Shakeri, an Afghan national who was deported from the United States in 2008, has been accused of plotting to assassinate Donald Trump. The 51-year-old allegedly masterminded a murder-for-hire operation in coordination with the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC).</p>

<p>On November 8, Shakeri and two others were charged in a criminal complaint for their alleged involvement in the plot to assassinate a US citizen of Iranian descent in New York. While the other two suspects were arrested, Shakeri remains at large and is believed to be in Iran.</p>

<p>According to a criminal complaint, in September 2024, Shakeri was instructed by an official from the IRGC to focus on “assassinating, former President of the United States, Donald J. Trump.” This directive came after Shakeri had already been involved in multiple operations on behalf of the IRGC, utilising his criminal network to support the group's agenda.</p>

<p>The criminal complaint added that according to Shakeri, during his meeting with an IRGC official on or about October 7, 2024, he was instructed to provide a plan within seven days to kill Trump. If Shakeri failed to do so within that timeframe, the IRGC official said the plan would be delayed until after the US Presidential elections. It was believed that Trump would lose, and it would then be easier to carry out the assassination. Shakeri told the FBI that he did not intend to propose a plan within the set deadline.</p>

<p>The US Department of Justice stated, “Shakeri has informed law enforcement that he was tasked on October 7, 2024, with providing a plan to kill President-elect Donald J. Trump. During the interview, Shakeri claimed he did not intend to propose a plan to kill Trump within the timeframe set by the IRGC.”</p>

<p>Shakeri was also assigned to keep an eye on two Jewish American citizens in New York and was offered $500,000 by an IRGC official for the murder of either target. Additionally, he was instructed to target Israeli tourists in Sri Lanka.</p>

<h2><strong>Background of Farhad Shakeri</strong></h2>

<p>Shakeri, an asset of the IRGC based in Tehran, immigrated to the US as a child. He was deported in 2008 after serving 14 years for a robbery conviction. In recent months, Shakeri has been involved in leveraging a network of criminal associates he met in US prisons to assist the IRGC. He has reportedly been supplying the IRGC with operatives for conducting surveillance and assassinations targeting individuals of interest, according to the US Department of Justice.</p>

<p>Though he was deported in 2008, his parole monitoring continued until 2015. In 2019, he was detained in Sri Lanka in connection with the seizure of a large quantity of heroin, highlighting an ongoing series of alleged criminal activities linked to his network.</p>

<p>Shakeri faces multiple charges, including conspiring to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organisation, which could result in up to 20 years in prison. He is also charged with providing material support to the same organisation, as well as conspiring to violate sanctions against the Iranian government under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, each of which carries a potential 20-year prison sentence.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At least 21 people were killed and 46 others injured on Saturday in a powerful bomb explosion at a crowded railway station in Pakistan's restive Balochistan province, officials said.</p>

<p>The explosion ripped through the provincial capital Quetta's railway station as passengers gathered on the platform before the scheduled departure of the Jaffar Express to Peshawar.</p>

<p>Quetta Senior Superintendent Police (SSP) Operations Muhammad Baloch said initial findings point to a possible suicide bombing.</p>

<p>He also confirmed that 21 people were killed in the explosion, adding that the number of victims could rise.</p>

<p>Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) has claimed responsibility for the attack.</p>

<p>Preliminary reports indicate that the explosion took place at the railway station's booking office.</p>

<p>Rescue and law enforcement teams responded immediately, securing the area and transporting the injured and dead to Civil Hospital Quetta, according to the provincial government spokesperson Shahid Rind.</p>

<p>An emergency was declared at the hospital where additional medical staff was summoned to deal with the injured, where officials said that 46 injured have been shifted so far.</p>

<p>The blast, which also damaged the platform's roof, was heard far and wide in various areas of the city.</p>

<p>Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti condemned the attack, terming it as "a horrific act targeting innocent civilians", and ordered an immediate investigation.</p>

<p>He said that terrorists are increasingly aiming civilians, labourers, women, and children, and vowed that those responsible would be pursued relentlessly.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The results of the US elections held last week have produced both relief and shock in equal measure.</p>

<p>The world at large and the Americans in particular are relieved that even if the outcome was largely unexpected, it was unambiguous, decisive and uncontested. This belied many foreboding predictions. There was a clear swing towards the hard right, with the Republican Party making major gains. Donald Trump, its candidate, defied all odds to win the Presidency. The Republicans expanded their control of the Senate and are poised for a majority in the House of Representatives as well. Factoring in the right-leaning Supreme Court and Federal Reserve under pressure to ease its ‘tight money' policy—the GOP has never had it this good for a long time.</p>

<h2><strong>A Rude Shock For All</strong></h2>

<p>On the other hand, the “winner taking it all” outcome was a rude surprise not only for the defeated Democrats but also for the psephologists and the mainstream media, who predicted a victory for Kamala Harris and a greater countervailing balance in Congress. Few expected a massive popular endorsement of Mr Trump, a populist with controversial views often bordering on unsubstantiated extremism. To many, the outcome raised questions about the maturity of the electorate and fidelity to the electoral process itself. Despite a booming economy, low inflation and low unemployment, the American voter succumbed to clever manipulation of popular perceptions with pet popular peeves about immigration, globalisation and personal economics being weaponised. For many, this was not an outcome the US deserved.</p>

<p>But now that this is a<em> fait accompli</em>, the larger question that needs to be answered is: How will this binary split play out during the incoming Trump Presidency? A lot would depend on whether Trump 2.0 would hark back to Trump 1.0 or whether the experiences of being the 45th President have been internalised for the 47th Presidency. This requires a granular analysis to discern the likely course of Trump 2.0.</p>

<h2><strong>An Unapologetic Trump&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p>To begin with, some basic observations are in order. Firstly, when the 78-year-old person concerned is not only unapologetic but triumphant about his past term, it raises some pertinent issues about his plans for the future in a vastly different context. Most of the catchy electoral promises made by candidate Trump were bare-bone intentions without precise targets. Similarly, many of the policy priorities articulated during the campaign intersect domestic and foreign affairs. Some of the planned and pre-announced quick fixes for the beginning of Trump 2.0 may open new Pandora's boxes. Further, given the unpredictability and transactional inconsistencies seen in Trump 1.0—from building an anti-immigrant wall on the southern border to the Summits with Kim Jong Un—were infructuous and were quietly abandoned. It cast doubts about keeping the new promises. Lastly, the bitter polarisation and name-calling of Trump 1.0 is a legacy that may haunt Trump 2.0. All these tactical complexities and shifts presage a pattern making Trump 2.0 invariably joined at the hip with Trump 1.0.</p>

<h2><strong>Pardons To MAGA To Immigration, A Domestic Roller-Coaster</strong></h2>

<p>Opening overtures of Trump 2.0 are likely to be dominated by domestic agenda. It's partly because his support base expects it and also because he has greater authority to do so. Firing inconvenient officials and presidential pardons, etc, are likely to be in the first flush. It may follow some measures at score-settling with “the enemies within” even as the bite may be less than the bark. He would find ways to flesh out his catchphrases such as “America First” and “Make America Great Again". Stopping illegal immigration and deporting those who have already done so would be a priority, even as some of these measures may be legally questionable.</p>

<p>On the economic side, Trump 2.0 may prune welfare spending and have a smaller government to balance with the promised lowering of taxes. Other intended moves such as high tariffs on imports and “Drill, Baby, Drill” may have collateral consequences in terms of trade wars, higher inflation, further demonise the “big oil”, environmental damage and lower export revenues. Rewarding Elon Musk and other corporate friends may lead to allegations of crony capitalism. The US political system does grant the President a high degree of impunity and the political context at the Congress and Supreme Court may be salubrious. Nevertheless, Mr Trump comes with the baggage of having been impeached twice and has the dubious distinction of being the first US President found guilty of 34 felony counts. His penchant for leaving a positive legacy is likely to restrain him.</p>

<h2><strong>The World Has Changed</strong>—<strong>For Trump, Too</strong></h2>

<p>In the foreign policy domain, President Trump would discover that the international context has turned far more complicated and nuanced. Despite bragging about his foreign policy accomplishments, Trump 1.0 was scarred by failed tactical initiatives, such as a deal with the Taliban, mollycoddling autocrats, reneging on the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) with Iran, antagonising longstanding partners, undermining multilateral architecture, etc. No wonder most partners reacted cautiously to the Trump victory. Even the ruling British Labour Party, for instance, had to painfully ruminate over the serious pejoratives it used to describe Trump 1.0. The rightist fringes in Europe and Israel have warmly welcomed his re-ascendence. The countries demonised during Trump 1.0, such as China, and Iran, reacted with predictable defiance.</p>

<p>The reactions to his elections were a foretaste of the kind of difficulties Trump 2.0 is likely to face as his ambitious agenda. While the US remains the world's primordial superpower, her hard and soft powers are significantly lower now, making unilateral pursuit of a wish list more difficult, particularly as he promises to avoid military engagements abroad. Trump 1.0 diplomacy was more about treating the symptoms than the disease. Living in denial was an often-exercised option on softer global issues such as climate change and disarmament. These tactical approaches merely kicked the can down the road, making the hotspots more numerous, more entrenched and intractable as evinced in the South China Sea, the Urals and the Middle East. Further, the cynical transactional approaches of Trump 1.0 lacked moral underpinnings, often reducing them to exercises in cynical manipulations and/or arm-twisting. More dangerously, it often allowed Trump's interlocutors to pander to flattery or deception to get their goals.</p>

<h2><strong>'A Man Deserves A Second Chance, But...'</strong></h2>

<p>The US under Trump 2.0 has two divergent options: isolationism and living in denial and inverted snobbery, or getting down from the moral horse and engaging either singly or through the same multilateral institutions that were often disfranchised during Trump 1.0. If Trump 2.0 intends to go beyond the palliatives deals and resolve the stubborn global crises, it would need to reinvent and realign itself with the new realities of the China-Russia nexus, more assertive middle-rung countries, including India, Brazil, Mexico, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, France, Germany, etc. Even traditional partners such as the UK, Japan, Australia, and Israel need to be courted afresh.</p>

<p>With his disregard for conventions, clipped deliveries, one-liners and over-the-top High Noons too often, Trump 1.0 styled itself more as an urbane cowboy than the conventional politician. We do not know if the invocation to resonate with the WASP psyche was accidental or deliberate. As he prepares to saunter to the White House yet again, it is worthwhile to quote John Wayne, the famous Hollywood Wild West icon: "A man deserves a second chance, but keep an eye on him."</p>

       <description><![CDATA[The Australia Today founder and editor-in-chief Jitarth Jai Bhardwaj has questioned the Justin Trudeau government as to why the rights of the Hindu community in Canada are not being upheld.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Calling the blocking of the prominent diaspora outlet 'Australia Today' by Canada, the "murder of free press", its founder and editor-in-chief Jitarth Jai Bhardwaj questioned the Justin Trudeau government as to why the rights of the Hindu community in the country are not being upheld, as they face "repeated attacks on their places of worship."</p>

<p>This comes after Canada blocked the outlet's social media handles and pages shortly after it aired a press conference of External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar with his Australian counterpart Penny Wong in Canberra. During the presser, the EAM slammed Canada for making allegations against India without any specific evidence and termed the "surveillance of Indian diplomats" unacceptable and also highlighted that the "political space has been given in Canada to anti-India elements."</p>

<p>On Thursday, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) also lambasted Canada for its "hypocrisy towards freedom of speech" following the blocking of 'The Australia Today' in the country.</p>

<p>Following the blocking by the Trudeau government, Mr Bhardwaj raised concerns over the move and said the publication would continue to advocate for open media.</p>

<p>In an interview with ANI, Mr Bhardwaj opened up about how their supporters notified them about not being able to access the outlet's content in Canada. After that, they found out that the press conference and interview of EAM Jaishankar went off the social media platform.</p>

<p>"We were notified by a lot of readers, followers of our page that they are not able to watch or view our content on Facebook and Instagram which they were able to watch like 10-15 minutes back and now they were not. They were trying to share it with their friends and colleagues and all of a sudden the press conference and the interview went off from the Facebook page and there was a notification written there that this content was not available for viewing in Canada by the order of Canadian government legislation," he said.</p>

<p>Condemning the Trudeau government's "dictatorial" move as a "murder of press freedom", the editor of the outlet said there should be a space for diverse views in a democracy.</p>

<p>"This is a murder of press freedom. This is not free speech, this is not how democracies act, and this is the way for dictators to act and clamp down on the press. In every democracy, there is space for diverse views and for the press to debate, interpret, analyse all those diverse views," Mr Bhardwaj said.</p>

<p>He added, "It seems that Canada is not kind of happy with how we were asking questions to Indian and Australian foreign ministers and they were not happy to see that a lot of Canadians were responding to it and they were trying to educate themselves than what Canadian government has been propagating for long now."</p>

<p>The Australia Today founder further elaborated on the news coverage of his outlet, and said they aim to provide coverage to the 'vibrant' Indian democracy, which he said, is being "left out".</p>

<p>"Australia Today is a news outlet that works for multicultural communities in the West. We do stories from UK, Canada, US, Australia, New Zealand, Fiji, Singapore, everywhere the Indian diaspora is hardworking and vibrant. Their stories are important, however, they are being left out by the so-called mainstream media, and this platform Australia Today highlights the issues which are very important to the Indian Australian community and Indian diaspora as a whole," he said.</p>

<p>While stating that the coverage of 'The Australia Today' is being appreciated everywhere for highlighting the condition of the Indian community, Mr Bhardwaj also shed light on the 'threats' received by the outlet. He alleged that the news platform and its journalists have been threatened by India-designated terrorist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun and other Khalistani extremists.</p>

<p>"Our coverage about what is happening by Khalistani groups in Canada or in the US was getting a lot of traction there. Our reporting was being appreciated in all the places. Gurpatwant Singh Pannun threatened us after issuing a video. He put pictures of me and my team online, telling his supporters to harm us in different ways. This has been going on and we have been reporting continuously without fear," he said.</p>

<p>Referring to the situation in Canada, 'The Australia Today' editor-in-chief said that the Hindu community is being "attacked, persecuted and suppressed" not just by the extremist elements, but also by the police and the authorities.</p>

<p>He also said that his outlet is willing to interview Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and ministers and ask why the rights of the Hindu community are not being realised in his country as they continue to face one untoward incident after the other.</p>

<p>"I'm just a reporter. I can report on what is going on. So I can say that the Hindu community is being attacked in Canada right now. The Hindu community is being persecuted in Canada right now by police, RCMP, and authorities. Everyone is working as if to suppress the rights of Canadian Hindu citizens," Mr Bhardwaj said.</p>

<p>"That's what I see right now and that's what we are reporting. If Trudeau or his ministers are happy to talk to us, we are happy to interview them and ask simple questions that any and every journalist should be asking them right now. Why Hindu community in Canada is being treated the way they are being treated? Why their rights are not upheld? Why are their temples being attacked? These are the questions Trudeau should be answering right now," he added.</p>

<p>Being asked about whether 'The Australia Today' will try to challenge the Canadian government's order, the editor said they would focus on reporting the issues of Canadian citizens without any fear.</p>

<p>"I don't think Canadian government is listening right now. But we will not stop doing what we do, that is reporting.

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a significant move, an Indian delegation met Afghanistan's acting Defence Minister Mullah Mohammad Yaqoob and offered the use of Chabahar Port in Iran to businesses in his country, and also discussed extending humanitarian assistance to Kabul.</p>

<p>The delegation was led by J P Singh, the Joint Secretary of the Pakistan-Afghanistan-Iran division in the External Affairs Ministry.</p>

<p>During a weekly media briefing here, External Affairs Ministry spokesman Randhir Jaiswal said that apart from Mohammad Yaqoob, the delegation also met with former President Hamid Karzai and other senior ministers, along with the heads of UN agencies.</p>

<p>"They had discussions on India's humanitarian assistance, also how the Chabahar Port can be utilised by the business community in Afghanistan for transactions and for export and import and any other thing that they would like to do," Jaiswal said in response to a question.</p>

<p>India does not recognise the Taliban regime that has been ruling Afghanistan since 2021.</p>

<p>India has been providing humanitarian aid, including wheat, medicines and medical supplies, to the Afghan people from time to time.</p>

<p>"I also want to recall here that providing humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan is an important part of our assistance programme and so far in the last few months, and a few years, we have dispatched several shipments of humanitarian assistance. We have longstanding ties with the people of Afghanistan, and these ties will continue to guide our approach towards the country," Jaiswal said.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, India signed a 10-year contract with Iran to develop and operate the Chabahar Port which was built with its assistance.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The suicide of a student at Oxford University has led to calls to review the 'cancel culture' prevalent in the elite institutions of the UK. Alexander Rogers (20), a third-year studying materials science at Corpus Christi College, took his own life in January earlier this year, after being 'ostracised' by his peers, according to a report in <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2024/11/07/oxford-student-kills-himself-cancel-culture-inquest-suicide/" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>The Telegraph</em></a>. Following two-day inquest proceedings at Oxford Coroner's Court, coroner Nicholas Graham concluded that the ostracisation "led him to form an intention to take his own life". The final report added that Rogers was "distraught" that his friends shunned him following an unreported allegation.</p>

<p>A former partner had alleged "discomfort over a sexual encounter" involving Rogers on January 11. Four days later, on January 15, a missing person's report was filed as Rogers wrote to friends, expressing "remorse for his actions and a belief that they were unintentional but unforgivable". His body was later pulled from the River Thames.</p>

<p>"While what we are dealing with here is in the interest of the public the family additionally has to carry the unique burden of grief, which is a heavy one. From what we have heard Alexander was an extremely able and popular young man and his passing is sad indeed," Graham added.</p>

<p>Dr Dominique Thompson, an independent consultant who investigated the case, stated that Rogers' exclusion from the college community was characteristic of a "pervasive cancel culture". She added that the allegation levelled caused a "pile-on" effect of students siding against Rogers because of an "unwritten" moral code to "do the right thing".</p>

<h3><strong>University taking action</strong></h3>

<p>Notably, the university was not aware of the cancel culture before the report and has since accepted its recommendations which "are being addressed with some diligence".</p>

<p>"Oxford University and Corpus Christi College extend our deepest sympathies to Alexander's family and everyone in our community who has been saddened by his tragic death," read a statement by the university.</p>

<p>"The College commissioned an independent review to identify all learning in this case with the aim of minimising the chance of such a tragic loss happening again," it added.</p>

<p>A prevention of future death report has also been sent to the Department of Education to consider the prevalence of "cancel culture" across higher education.</p>

<p>Roger's family said their priority was ensuring that the culture of social ostracisation is recognised so that similar tragedies can be prevented from reoccurring.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Elon Musk has added more to his personal fortune since Donald Trump's US election win than anyone else tracked by the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Elon Musk's net worth has surpassed $300 billion for the first time in almost three years, as shares of Tesla Inc. soar on bets that his close ties with President-elect Donald Trump will bolster the company.</p>

<p>Musk has added more to his personal fortune since Trump's win than anyone else tracked by the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Tesla's stock has jumped 28% since Tuesday's close, increasing his wealth by $50 billion to $313.7 billion.</p>

<p>Trump has openly suggested moves that would benefit Musk's businesses. He said he'd reconsider his plans to slow the move to electric vehicles because of the Tesla co-founder's backing. Trump also voiced support for SpaceX, which makes up $82 billion of Musk's net worth, and its push to reach Mars. And the president-elect has floated the idea of Musk serving in a newly created role in his administration as efficiency czar.</p>

<p>"One of the best strategic bets he ever made was ultimately this bet on Trump," Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said Thursday on Bloomberg TV. "Musk is the big winner in this Trump sweepstakes."</p>

<p>Musk inserted himself late into the presidential race, campaigning alongside Trump in the weeks leading up to the election and bankrolling stunts such as a $1 million daily sweepstakes for voters in battleground states. He became a part of Trump's inner circle, spending election night at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach.</p>

<p>Musk, 53, is the only person to ever have a fortune in excess of $300 billion, a mark he last reached in January 2022, according to Bloomberg's wealth index. It's still short of his all-time high of $340.4 billion in 2021.</p>

<p>Even before the election, Musk's net worth had been on the rise, with strong Tesla earnings in mid-October adding $34 billion to his fortune in a day.</p>

<p>Most of Musk's fortune is tied up in Tesla, the world's largest electric-vehicle manufacturer, whose prospects depend heavily on the federal government. Musk said during a Tesla earnings call last month that he'd push for a federal approval process for autonomous vehicles - a centerpiece of the company's future strategy - if selected for a role in the Trump administration.</p>

<p>Trump initially said he'd roll back EV initiatives in his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention in July, but changed his position a month later.</p>

<p>"I'm for electric cars," Trump said at a rally in Atlanta. "I have to be, because Elon endorsed me very strongly."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

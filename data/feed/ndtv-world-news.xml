       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>California legislators are set to vote on a bill as soon as this week that would broadly regulate how artificial intelligence is developed and deployed in California even as a number of tech giants have voiced broad opposition.</p>

<p>Here is background on the bill, known as SB 1047, and why it has faced backlash from Silicon Valley technologists and some lawmakers:</p>

<h3><strong>WHAT DOES THE BILL DO?</strong></h3>

<p>Advanced by State Senator Scott Wiener, a Democrat, the proposal would mandate safety testing for many of the most advanced AI models that cost more than $100 million to develop or those that require a defined amount of computing power. Developers of AI software operating in the state would also need to outline methods for turning off the AI models if they go awry, effectively a kill switch.</p>

<p>The bill would also give the state attorney general the power to sue if developers are not compliant, particularly in the event of an ongoing threat, such as the AI taking over government systems like the power grid.</p>

<p>As well, the bill would require developers to hire third-party auditors to assess their safety practices and provide additional protections to whistleblowers speaking out against AI abuses.</p>

<h3><strong>WHAT HAVE LAWMAKERS SAID?</strong></h3>

<p>SB 1047 has already passed the state Senate by a 32-1 vote. Last week it passed the state Assembly appropriations committee, setting up a vote by the full Assembly. If it passes by the end of the legislative session on Aug. 31, it would advance to Governor Gavin Newsom to sign or veto by Sept. 30.</p>

<p>Wiener, who represents San Francisco, home to OpenAI and many of the startups developing the powerful software, has said legislation is necessary to protect the public before advances in AI become either unwieldy or uncontrollable.</p>

<p>However, a group of California Congressional Democrats oppose the bill, including San Francisco's Nancy Pelosi; Ro Khanna, whose congressional district encompasses much of Silicon Valley; and Zoe Lofgren, from San Jose.</p>

<p>Pelosi this week called SB 1047 ill-informed and said it may cause more harm than good. In an open letter last week, the Democrats said the bill could drive developers from the state and threaten so-called open-source AI models, which rely on code that is freely available for anyone to use or modify.</p>

<h3><strong>WHAT DO TECH LEADERS SAY?</strong></h3>

<p>Tech companies developing AI - which can respond to prompts with fully formed text, images or audio as well as run repetitive tasks with minimal intervention - have called for stronger guardrails for AI's deployment. They have cited risks that the software could one day evade human intervention and cause cyberattacks, among other concerns. But they also largely balked at SB 1047.</p>

<p>Wiener revised the bill to appease tech companies, relying in part on input from AI startup Anthropic - backed by Amazon and Alphabet. Among other changes, he eliminated the creation of a government AI oversight committee.</p>

<p>Wiener also took out criminal penalties for perjury, though civil suits may still be brought.</p>

<p>Alphabet's Google and Meta have expressed concerns in letters to Wiener. Meta said the bill threatens to make the state unfavorable to AI development and deployment. The Facebook parent's chief scientist, Yann LeCun, in a July X post called the bill potentially harmful to research efforts.</p>

<p>OpenAI, whose ChatGPT is credited with accelerating the frenzy over AI since its broad release in late 2022, has said AI should be regulated by the federal government and that SB 1047 creates an uncertain legal environment.</p>

<p>Of particular concern is the potential for the bill to apply to open-source AI models. Many technologists believe open-source models are important for creating less risky AI applications more quickly, but Meta and others have fretted that they could be held responsible for policing open-source models if the bill passes. Wiener has said he supports open-source models and one of the recent amendments to the bill raised the standard for which open-sourced models are covered under its provisions.</p>

<p>The bill also has its backers in the technology sector. Geoffrey Hinton, widely credited as a "godfather of AI," former OpenAI employee Daniel Kokotajlo and researcher Yoshua Bengio have said they support the bill.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Shahed Abu Omar, 20, was in her third year studying computer science at Gaza's Al Azhar University when it was reduced to rubble by Israel's military campaign in the Palestinian territory.</p>

<p>She is now one of 90,000 university students left stranded in a war with no end in sight that has damaged or destroyed all 12 of the higher education institutions in the Gaza Strip, according to Palestinian official data.</p>

<p>However, Abu Omar is determined to keep studying, braving a perilous daily journey to reach a stable internet connection that allows her to learn online.</p>

<p>"We cannot go to our university or study away from it," she said, alluding to the difficulty of remote learning with such poor internet connection.</p>

<p>Perched in the rubble of a destroyed house, Abu Omar studies from her mobile phone. Her mother, Hanin Sarour, said they had come to the area to reach an internet connection. The connection, vital to downloading pre-recorded lectures and communicating with professors, was still weak, she said. "Every step is dangerous and difficult," Sarour added.</p>

<p>Most of Abu Omar's professors are in the Gaza Strip as well, she said, facing the same difficulties their students do.</p>

<p>Abu Omar's final exams are in just two weeks. She fears she will only fall further behind. "I am sure we will lose more than the year that we've lost already," she said.</p>

<p>She dreams of returning to university, sitting in a classroom, and meeting with professors and friends.</p>

<p>The war, now in its 11th month, has also interrupted education for Gaza's estimated 625,000 school-aged children, leaving them unable to attend classes.</p>

<p>The uncertainty for Abu Omar and students across the small coastal enclave is likely to persist. Even after the war ends, students do not know when universities will reopen, she said.</p>

<p>Despite all the difficulties, Abu Omar will continue to study in the hopes of not losing a whole year. "We are trying to achieve something," she said.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump will be behind bulletproof glass Wednesday for his first outdoor rally since surviving an assassination attempt, but the Republican faces a bigger challenge in matching the white-hot enthusiasm of crowds flocking to Kamala Harris.</p>

<p>The event in Asheboro, North Carolina, a battleground state in the tight November 5 election, is a chance for Trump to reclaim his longtime dominance in staging spectacular rallies.</p>

<p>Accompanied by vice presidential pick J.D. Vance, he will take to the stage at an aviation museum, speaking against a backdrop of vintage war planes about his national security policies.</p>

<p>It is the first time he will hold a big event outdoors since being lightly injured in an attempted assassination at a similarly open site in Butler, Pennsylvania, a month ago. That attack left one bystander dead before the shooter was killed in return fire by a Secret Service sniper.</p>

<p>The Secret Service recommended that Trump, 78, stick to more easily controllable indoor venues, such as sports arenas. He has since attended about a dozen indoor events.</p>

<p>The Secret Service does not comment publicly on security operations and did not respond to requests for comment on Wednesday's preparations. However, a screen could clearly be seen being erected around the stage Trump and Vance will speak from later.</p>

<p>Crowds are an integral part of Trump's political brand in which the right-wing billionaire seeks to portray himself as an outsider and man of the people. Even as president he kept up a steady schedule of election-style rallies, often filling sports arenas with at least 10,000 people.</p>

<p>He'd counted on these demonstrations of strength as a key weapon in his plan to make President Joe Biden, whose own public events are generally low-key and relatively small affairs, look ineffectual.</p>

<h3><strong>Trump's rally dominance upended</strong></h3>

<p>Trump's strategy was upended on July 21, however, when Biden, 81, abruptly dropped his reelection bid and endorsed his younger vice president as the future of the Democratic Party.</p>

<p>The immediate explosion of Democratic support for Harris has stunned the Trump campaign.</p>

<p>And nowhere is the shift in momentum more visible than in the 59-year-old Harris's ability to pack arenas.</p>

<p>She is consistently filling venues with well over 10,000. On Tuesday night supporters packed the Democratic National Convention in Chicago while she hosted a mass rally of her own in Milwaukee.</p>

<p>In a clear dig at Trump, her Milwaukee event took place in exactly the same arena that the Republicans had used for their convention back in July.</p>

<p>North Carolina is one of a handful of swing states that are expected to determine the outcome of the November 5 election.</p>

<p>US presidential elections are not decided by an overall national vote but state-by-state, with each state worth varying amounts of Electoral College votes, and the winning candidate needing to score the majority.</p>

<p>Most states trend solidly Republican or firmly Democrat, and only around seven are considered true toss-ups where the race is really fought -- and where the candidates spend most of their campaign.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dosa, butter chicken and mango lassi, an unlikely combo for some perhaps but topping the list of favourites for Polish diners who say the dishes remind them of their travels to the country.</p>

<p>More than 45 Indian restaurants are offering a variety of traditional Indian food across Poland, with the capital Warsaw City having at least a dozen of them, as per the listing of the Embassy of India in Poland here.</p>

<p>And not just dining out, Indian food is popular as a takeaway option too across Poland.</p>

<p>India and Indian food are the talk of the town yet again as Warsaw is excited to receive Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who will arrive here for his two-day visit on Wednesday. This will be the first official visit of an Indian prime minister to this country in 45 years.</p>

<p>In Warsaw, Chetan Nandani, a Gujarati businessman, recently opened a restaurant called 'Chaiwala', possibly alluding to the moniker that has stuck with PM Modi since 2014.</p>

<p>Nandani, who already ran a restaurant called 'Curry House,' opened the 'Chaiwala' owing to the popular demand for Indian food. He claimed to have introduced Indian street food to Warsaw.</p>

<p>Polish people who visit India, who visit metros such as Delhi, Mumbai and Kolkata, they get many other things here but not the Indian street food, Nandani said, adding, "I have named it after our beloved Prime Minister Narendra Modi." "Our 'Curry House' chain is already very big here in Poland. We own nine of them. People were suggesting that because we are from India, we should introduce some Indian street food that Polish people can relish. That was the aim behind opening 'Chaiwala'," he told PTI Videos.</p>

<p>According to Indian restaurant owners, Polish people have developed a liking not just for Indian cuisine but also for its rich culture.</p>

<p>"I really like dosa. The best dosa in Warsaw is in India Gate (restaurant), and it really feels like (those) in South India. I have travelled many times to Chennai and Kerala and actually, the food here definitely tastes like that," Anna Maria Rozek, a Polish national, told PTI Videos here.</p>

<p>Chandu, the owner of India Gate food chain, said, "The food is really tasty here ... Indian food with a lot of spices. Every item has a different taste. They (the Polish people) love butter chicken, mango lassi. They love Indian food and Indian people also." The Polish people also love Indian culture and Indian movies are also doing well in Poland nowadays, Chandu said.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Nandani is also confident the demand for Indian street food will grow more and more in times to come in Poland.</p>

<p>Not just in the capital Warsaw, but Indian restaurants are popular in cities such as Krakow and Wroclaw, offering a variety of options to satisfy the curiosity and cravings of foodies in this eastern European country.</p>

<p>For instance, The Castle, a homestay in Krakow, advertises on its website, "Krakow may be deeply rooted in Polish tradition, but its culinary scene offers a wide range of international flavours, with Indian cuisine taking a prominent spot. If you're craving the spicy and aromatic dishes of India, Krakow has a wide range of restaurants that bring authentic tastes right to your plate." It then lists about half a dozen places in the city.</p>

<p>Krakow Buzz, a site that is all about the buzz about the city, and has guides to everything that's hot in the Polish city of the kings, says: "When those endless plates of Polish dumplings and sour Slavic soups get just a little too much, there's a whole stack of Indian restaurants in Krakow that can come to the rescue." "They'll let you swap the potatoes and carbs of Central Europe for a tongue-sizzling sampling of the East. They tout spice-packed curries and pakoras, and can be found in some seriously stunning corners of the city," it describes the mouth-watering Indian dishes and goes on to detail at least half a dozen Indian restaurants in the city.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Veronica Roleen Gast, 30, was arrested in Minnesota for attempting to run over her boyfriend during a heated argument en route to couples therapy.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Minnesota woman was arrested after allegedly trying to crush her boyfriend under her car during an intense fight. According to police reports, Veronica Roleen Gast, 30, and her boyfriend were driving to a couple therapy session when the argument quickly became out of hand. The boyfriend, whose name has not been disclosed, told the authorities that he chose to end the relationship and asked Gast to take him home.</p>

<p>Gast reportedly became furious and parked the car on the road, forcing her boyfriend to get out. As he walked away from the vehicle, Gast was said to have driven the car towards him, nearly hitting him. Witnesses to the incident called it a harrowing experience.</p>

<p>The boyfriend rolled over the hood, and smashed into the windshield, shattering it. He suffered a laceration to his right elbow.</p>

<p>Gast was taken into custody and charged with second-degree assault and criminal vehicular operation. She is facing charges of "bodily harm, gross negligence, and domestic assault.". The investigation into the incident is ongoing.</p>

<p>"The defendant admitted that as she was pulling away, she hit the victim with her vehicle. The defendant said she slowed down and stopped to call the police," a police report obtained by <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.crimeonline.com/2024/08/15/minnesota-woman-floors-gas-pedal-rams-boyfriend-into-windshield-on-way-to-couples-therapy/"><em>Crime Online</em></a> said.</p>

<p>"The defendant said she was in shock at hitting the victim, so she did not stop right away but let off the gas," the report continued.</p>

<p>Gast told officers the windshield crack wasn't caused by his body but by him punching it. It's unclear whether Gast sustained any injuries.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The bodies of British tech entrepreneur Mike Lynch and his daughter Hannah have been found in the yacht which sank off Sicily, the Daily Telegraph newspaper reported on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Scuba divers scouring the wreck of British tech magnate's family yacht, which sank two days ago, had earlier found two bodies inside it, a source close to rescue operations had said on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Inspection of the wreck, lying sideways at a depth of around 50 metres, was a "long and complex" operation, the Italian fire department said, with inside spaces obstructed by furniture and debris, and scuba divers having just 8-10 minutes beneath the water before needing to resurface.</p>

<p>Separately, the coast guard deployed a remotely operated vehicle to scan the seabed and take underwater pictures and videos that it said may provide "useful and timely elements" for prosecutors looking into the disaster.</p>

<p>The coast guard has been questioning survivors, including the captain of the Bayesian, and passengers on the yacht that was moored next to it who witnessed the ship going down, judicial sources said.</p>

<p>No one is under investigation at the moment, sources added.</p>

<p>The British-flagged Bayesian, a 56-metre-long (184-ft) superyacht, was carrying 22 people, and was anchored off the port of Porticello, near Palermo, when it capsized during a fierce storm on Monday.</p>

<p>The Bayesian, which was owned by Lynch's wife, was built by Italian shipbuilder Perini in 2008 and last refitted in 2020. It had the world's tallest aluminium mast, measuring 72 metres, according to its makers.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Pakistani man appeared in court Wednesday to face charges of cyber terrorism after allegedly spreading disinformation on his clickbait website thought to have fuelled anti-immigration riots in Britain.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Farhan Asif was accused of publishing an article on his Channel3Now website falsely claiming that a Muslim asylum seeker was suspected in a deadly knife attack on children in the United Kingdom.&nbsp;</p>

<p>UK authorities have blamed online misinformation for sparking days of riots which targeted mosques and hotels housing asylum seekers as well as police officers and other properties.</p>

<p>"He is a 31-year-old software engineer with no journalism credentials, apart from running the Channel3Now website, which served as a source of income for him," a senior official at Pakistan's Federal Investigation Agency told AFP on condition of anonymity.</p>

<p>"Initial investigations indicate that his sole intent was to make money through clickbait content."</p>

<p>Asif appeared at a Lahore district court on Wednesday charged with cyber terrorism and was remanded to custody for one day, the official added.</p>

<p>The article with the false information was published on Channel3Now just hours after the attack and was widely cited in viral social media posts.</p>

<p>More than a dozen English towns and cities saw unrest and riots after the July 29 knife attack that killed three girls during a dance class in Southport.</p>

<p>The man charged with murder and attempted murder over the stabbing spree, Axel Rudakubana, was born in Britain to parents who hail from Rwanda, an overwhelmingly Christian country.</p>

<p>Officials have blamed far-right elements for helping to stir up the disorder.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Scuba divers scouring the wreck of British tech magnate Mike Lynch's family yacht, which sank off Sicily two days ago, have found two bodies inside it, a source close to rescue operations said on Wednesday.</p>

<p>One of the bodies belonged to a heavily built man, the source said.</p>

<p>Rescue officials have been looking for six missing people, including Lynch, his 18-year-old daughter and Jonathan Bloomer, a non-executive chair of Morgan Stanley International.</p>

<p>The British-flagged Bayesian, a 56-metre-long (184-ft) superyacht, was carrying 22 people, and was anchored off the port of Porticello, near Palermo, when it capsized during a fierce storm on Monday.</p>

<p>Fifteen people survived, while the body of the onboard chef, Canadian-Antiguan national Recaldo Thomas, was found near the wreck hours after the disaster.</p>

<p>Inspection of the wreck, lying sideways at a depth of around 50 metres, was a "long and complex" operation, the Italian fire department said, with inside spaces obstructed by furniture and debris, and scuba divers having just 8-10 minutes beneath the water before needing to resurface.</p>

<p>Separately, the coast guard deployed a remotely operated vehicle to scan the seabed and take underwater pictures and videos that it said may provide "useful and timely elements" for prosecutors looking into the disaster.</p>

<p>The coast guard has been questioning survivors, including the captain of the Bayesian, and passengers on the yacht that was moored next to it who witnessed the ship going down, judicial sources said.</p>

<p>No one is under investigation at the moment, sources added.</p>

<h3><strong>MISSING PASSENGERS</strong></h3>

<p>Lynch, 59, is one of the UK's best-known tech entrepreneurs and has been referred to as the country's Bill Gates.</p>

<p>He built the UK's largest software firm, Autonomy, which was sold to HP for $11 billion in 2011, after which the deal spectacularly unravelled with the U.S. tech giant accusing him of fraud, resulting in a lengthy trial. Lynch was acquitted on all charges by a jury in San Francisco in June.</p>

<p>The other missing passengers were Bloomer's wife Judy, Clifford Chance lawyer Chris Morvillo and his wife, Neda Morvillo. Morvillo represented Lynch in the San Francisco trial, while Bloomer was a character witness on his behalf.</p>

<p>Experts have been at a loss to explain how a large luxury vessel, presumed to have top-class fittings and safety features, could have sunk within minutes, as recounted by witnesses. The yacht anchored next to it was unharmed by the tempest.</p>

<p>The Bayesian, which was owned by Lynch's wife, was built by Italian shipbuilder Perini in 2008 and last refitted in 2020. It had the world's tallest aluminium mast, measuring 72 metres, according to its makers.</p>

<h3><strong>BLACK SWAN EVENT</strong></h3>

<p>Its captain James Cutfield, a 51-year-old New Zealander who survived the shipwreck, was a "very good sailor" and "very well respected" in the Mediterranean, his brother Mark told The New Zealand Herald.</p>

<p>Matthew Schanck, chair of the Maritime Search and Rescue Council, a UK-based non-profit organisation that trains sea rescuers, said the Bayesian was the victim of a "high impact" weather-related incident.</p>

<p>"If it was a water spout, which it appears to be, it's what I would class as like a 'black swan' event," he told Reuters, referring to a rare and unpredictable phenomenon.</p>

<p>He said he was confident the authorities would "get to the bottom" of what caused the shipwreck, thanks to the accounts of survivors, witnesses and examination of the sunken hull, which did not show any apparent signs of damage.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As Poland rolled out the red carpet for Prime Minister Narendra Modi today, hundreds of 'Indian Poles' are commemorating a historic facet of India-Poland relations which has been the bedrock of people-to-people ties between the two countries since the Second World War.</p>

<p>"One of the unique bonds between our countries relates to the time in the 1940s, during World War II, when more than 6,000 Polish women and children found refuge in two princely states in India, Jamnagar and Kolhapur. As you may be aware, Jam Sahib of Nawanagar had provided shelter to more than 1,000 Polish children, and others were offered refuge in Kolhapur," Tanmaya Lal, Secretary (West) at the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said earlier this week while announcing PM Modi's August 21-22 visit, the first by an Indian Prime Minister to Poland in the past 45 years.</p>

<p>While Digvijaysinhji Ranjitsinhji Jadeja, the Jam Sahib of Nawanagar who is known in Poland as the 'Good Maharaja', gave refuge to over 1,000 Polish children in the famous Balachadi camp, the royal family of Kolhapur provided safe haven to more than 5,000 Polish women and children in the equally-famous Valivade camp.</p>

<p>A monument, commemorating Jam Sahib Digvijaysinhji Ranjitsinhji Jadeja, was unveiled in October, 2014 at the Square of the Good Maharaja, Ochota District in Warsaw.</p>

<p>Another plaque commemorating the Valivade-Kolhapur camp near the Monte Casino War Memorial was inaugurated in November 2017 in Warsaw.</p>

<p>As many as eight Polish primary and secondary schools are also named after Jam Sahib.</p>

<p>During his historic visit, PM Modi is scheduled to visit these memorials that commemorate the very special episodes of Jamnagar and Kolhapur.</p>

<p>A large number of Polish refugees and their descendants have, over the last many decades, expressed their gratitude towards the two royal families of India by building memorials in Warsaw and organising annual events to keep the memories alive.</p>

<p>The Association of Poles in India, which reunites all the Polish people who lived between 1942 and 1948 in the two camps set up by the Maharajas of Jamnagar and Kolhapur, meets once in two years to recall and reiterate their gratitude and affection for the two royal families and the people of India.</p>

<p>During its last meeting held in Gdansk in September 2023, the first after the Covid pandemic, Jan Chendynski, the President of the Association, recounted "some of the happy childhood memories" that most of them had of the camps.</p>

<p>Nagma Mallick, India's Ambassador to Poland, who attended the meeting as a special invitee, acknowledged that the story of the Polish refugees was not as well-known in India as it deserved to be and also commended the Indian Poles for keeping this memory alive in Poland.</p>

<p>Commemorating the historic link, another event titled 'Remembering the Good Maharajas' was organised in the Old Orangery of the iconic Royal Lazienki park in July 2022 where 22 photographs from the camps of Valivade and Nawanagar depicting the lives of the Polish children in India during that period were exhibited for the guests.</p>

<p>Sambhaji Chhatrapati, the descendant of the Chhatrapati Shivaji and Piyushkumar Matalia, representative of the Jam Sahib of Nawanagar, especially flew from India to attend the event while former MP and President of the Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR) Vinay Sahasrabuddhe and Ambassador Mallick, represented the Indian government at the event which was attended by a large number of Polish citizens who were in the camps as children.</p>

<p>According to the Indian Embassy in Poland, there is also a strong tradition of Indology studies in Poland, with Polish scholars having translated Sanskrit into Polish as early as in the 19th Century.</p>

<p>"Sanskrit was being studied at the 600-year-old Jagiellonian University in Krakow (the oldest in Poland) in 1860-61, with a Chair of Sanskrit having been established there in 1893.</p>

<p>The Indology Department of the Oriental Institute at the University of Warsaw (established in 1932) is the biggest centre for Indian studies in Central Europe," the MEA states.</p>

<p>Study of Indian languages, literature, culture and Indology is also pursued at the Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznan and the University of Wroclaw.</p>

<p>ICCR sponsored the first Central &amp; Eastern European regional conference of Indology in Warsaw University in September 2005 in which 19 scholars from 11 countries participated.</p>

<p>An MoU for the establishment of an ICCR Chair of Indian studies at the Jagiellonian University was signed in February 2017 and two Indian professors have since been appointed as ICCR Chair Professors since the signing of the MoU.</p>

<p>"There are long-standing cultural ties between India and Poland, and Indology studies in Polish universities date back to the 19th century. There is respect and appreciation in Poland for Indian culture and spiritual ethos, including yoga and Ayurveda," said MEA's Secretary (West) Tanmaya Lal on Monday, ahead of the PM's visit to Poland.</p>

<p>In Warsaw, PM Modi will hold talks with the country's President Andrzej Duda on Thursday.</p>

<p>He is also scheduled to interact with members of the Indian community, select Polish business leaders and prominent Indologists.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In its latest beta release, WhatsApp is introducing a significant privacy feature designed to address one of the platform's most persistent issues--spam.</p>

<p>The new feature, available in the beta version 2.24.18.2 for Android, introduces a Username PIN system aimed at improving user security and curbing unwanted messages, according to GSM Arena.</p>

<p>This new functionality allows WhatsApp users to set a four-digit PIN in addition to their username.</p>

<p>The PIN serves as an extra layer of security, ensuring that users who have not interacted with you previously cannot send you messages solely by knowing your username.</p>

<p>This measure is expected to significantly reduce spam and enhance privacy for WhatsApp users, according to GSM Arena.</p>

<p>"Once implemented, this feature should greatly cut down on spam, which has been a prevalent issue on WhatsApp," said a spokesperson for the company, according to GSM Arena.</p>

<p>The PIN feature will require anyone who wishes to message you for the first time to know both your username and the PIN you have set.</p>

<p>Conversely, conversations with contacts you have previously interacted with will remain unaffected by the new username and PIN system.</p>

<p>The transition to using usernames will be seamless for these existing connections, allowing current chats to proceed as usual.</p>

<p>Despite the promising benefits of this new feature, it remains in the beta testing phase, and there is no confirmed timeline for its official release.</p>

<p>Given WhatsApp's typical development cycle, it may be some time before the username and PIN features are available to the general public, with a launch potentially not occurring before the end of the year, according to GSM Arena.</p>

<p>As WhatsApp continues to refine this feature, users are encouraged to stay updated on the progress through future beta releases.</p>

<p>The introduction of the Username PIN marks a proactive step by WhatsApp in addressing privacy concerns and improving the overall user experience on the platform.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Authorities in central Iran executed a male fortune-teller for raping and sexually assaulting his clients, the judiciary said on Wednesday.</p>

<p>"A fortuneteller, who assaulted women and girls was executed in Yazd prison," said Hossein Tahmasebi, chief justice of the central province, according to the Iranian judiciary's Mizan Online website.</p>

<p>"The sentence of this rapist fortune-teller was carried out after being issued by the Revolutionary Court of Yazd and confirmed by the supreme judicial authority".</p>

<p>According to Tahmasebi, the man had "assaulted and raped women and girls under false pretences", using his fortune-telling services to deceive his clients.</p>

<p>Mizan reported that the convict was arrested sometime between March 2020 and March 2021 and that his request for amnesty was rejected because of "the number of complaints" against him.</p>

<p>The Islamic republic maintains the death penalty for several crimes, including rape and sexual assault.</p>

<p>In July 2023, Iran executed three men after they were convicted of raping women they had lured to a fake cosmetic surgery clinic and injected with anaesthetic drugs.</p>

<p>They were found guilty of conspiring in 12 cases of sexual assault in late 2021 in the southern province of Hormozgan.</p>

<p>Iran executes more people per year than any other nation except China, according to human rights groups including Amnesty.</p>

<p>It generally carries out executions by hanging.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi will be in Poland and Ukraine this week. Both visits are historic in their own ways: for Poland, this will be the first visit by an Indian Prime Minister in 45 years, while for Ukraine, Modi's will be the first-ever visit by an Indian Prime Minister. Where Modi has talked about India and Poland's "mutual commitment to democracy and pluralism" reinforcing the bilateral relationship, he has expressed "hope for an early return of peace and stability" in Ukraine.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Often, China and India are put in the same bracket when it comes to their response to the Ukraine war. But Modi's visit to the country, which follows his much-controversial trip to Russia last month, is why the world shouldn't compare them.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>India Is More Than Just A Mediator In Europe</strong></h2>

<p>Modi's visit to Russia last month raised a lot of eyebrows as it was also his first visit abroad in his third term. There is now talk of India becoming a potential peacemaker in the Russia-Ukraine war. But that is missing the woods for the trees. Modi will be in Ukraine to underline that New Delhi's position on the war remains consistent. Despite close ties with Russia and its decision not to publicly call out Russia as an aggressor, New Delhi has always maintained that the sanctity of territorial integrity and sovereignty remains inviolable in international affairs, and that dialogue and diplomacy is the only way to a sustainable outcome.</p>

<p>Unlike China, Modi publicly told Putin during his visit to Moscow that this was not the era of war, and expressed pain at the death of children after a lethal strike by Russia on Kyiv's main hospital for children. At that time, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had denounced Modi for visiting Russia, calling the trip a "devastating blow to peace efforts". But New Delhi has continued to maintain its ties with both Moscow and Kyiv throughout the course of the war over the last two and a half years, steadfast in its belief that both sides should be engaged if a lasting solution is to be found.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>A Renewed Vision For Europe</strong></h2>

<p>Europe is facing a moment of reckoning with growing internal challenges, a widening regional divide, a war that shows no signs of ending, a rising China, calls for isolationism in the US, and a fracturing of the post-Cold War security arrangement. The end of the Ukraine war will perhaps lay the foundations of a new security order in Europe, but that end is nowhere in sight as both sides search for favourable battlefield realities that they can potentially leverage at the negotiating table. It is at this critical juncture that Europe has started looking at India as a key partner.</p>

<p>And New Delhi has reciprocated. India now views Europe as central to its developmental and strategic priorities. This is borne by the extraordinary diplomatic investment the Modi government has made in imparting momentum to its ties with Europe. What has been an evolving feature of this outreach is India's attempts to engage with different sub-regions of Europe, allowing New Delhi to focus on their core strengths. It is Central Europe that is now the focus, with Modi visiting Austria last month followed by Poland and Ukraine now. The region has developed its own unique voice on European matters, and especially after the Russian invasion, it has been critical in shaping the larger European response to regional and global issues.</p>

<h2><strong>Why Poland Matters To New Delhi</strong></h2>

<p>As for Modi's visit to Poland, it is among the fastest-growing economies in Europe and has been vocal about its strategic aspirations to see Europe emerge as a key geopolitical actor on the global stage. Warsaw's role will also be critical in shaping the European security architecture once the embers of war in Ukraine cool down. Its location makes it a hub of connectivity across Europe, and India enjoys a lot of goodwill. If India is to move beyond France, Germany and the UK in its European imagination, then building strong economic ties with Poland will be critical. Modi's visit should lay the foundation for a long-term sustainable partnership with Warsaw.</p>

<p>It is in New Delhi's interest that a sustainable security architecture takes shape in Europe as European stability is critical for a globally engaged India with critical equities in that geography. New Delhi won't be playing the mediator. Its eyes are on the larger horizon, where India's emergence as a credible partner of Europe is seen as important for ensuring that its own developmental and strategic priorities remain insulated from wider disruption.&nbsp;</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tesla has issued a recall for about 9,100 Model X sports utility vehicles in the US over a trim on the roof that could separate, it said on Wednesday, its second over the same issue since 2020.</p>

<p>Front and center roof cosmetic trim pieces may be adhered without primer, and could separate from the vehicle creating a road hazard and increasing the risk of a crash, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said.</p>

<p>The recall covers 2016 model year Model X SUVs. Tesla said a change in process had been made at the supplier in July 2016 to prevent the issue in later models.</p>

<p>The company will test adhesion of the roof trim and reattach the trim pieces as necessary at no cost to owners of the vehicles.</p>

<p>Since 2022 Tesla has been studying reports of issues involving vehicles that had undergone the recall remedy and conducted aging tests, including heat and humidity, it said on Wednesday.</p>

<p>It concluded the 2020 recall remedy was not robust enough to detect cosmetic roof trim pieces that may detach due to lack of primer.</p>

<p>Tesla said it is aware of about 170 reports and claims that may be related to the issue, but said it has no reports of crashes or injuries tied to the recall issues.</p>

<p>This marks a rare physical recall for the Austin, Texas-based automaker, which usually fixes issues through over-the-air software updates.</p>

<p>Tesla recalled nearly 2.6 million vehicles due to safety concerns in the first six months of the year, only behind Ford Motor which has recalled about 3.6 million vehicles in the US, according to recall management platform developer Bizzycar.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ukraine fired 11 drones Wednesday at Moscow that Russia said were shot down during one of the largest strikes against the capital, while Ukrainian defences reported stopping 50 Russian drones and missiles.</p>

<p>The strikes on Moscow come amid a Ukrainian offensive in Russia's Kursk region -- which Kyiv has said is aimed at bringing the campaign launched by Russia in February 2022 closer to an end on "fair" terms.</p>

<p>"Eleven drones were destroyed" over Moscow and its surrounding region, the defence ministry said.</p>

<p>"This is one of the largest ever attempts to attack Moscow with drones," Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said.</p>

<p>In total, 45 drones from Ukraine were destroyed by the Russian air defense systems, according to the Russian defense ministry.</p>

<p>Sobyanin said in an earlier post that no damage or casualties had been reported.</p>

<p>Drone attacks on Moscow are rare, with Russia saying in May it had downed a drone outside the capital, forcing restrictions to be imposed at two major airports in the city for under an hour.</p>

<p>In the night from Tuesday to Wednesday, a total of 72 air targets were detected over Ukraine, according to Ukrainian Air Force Commander Mykola Oleshchuk.</p>

<p>Fifty drones and a guided missile were shot down, he said in a post on Telegram.</p>

<p>Kyiv was one of the locations targeted.</p>

<p>"The enemy continues to attack our region with strike drones. The air raid lasted all night and into the morning for more than nine hours," Kyiv's military administration said on Telegram.</p>

<p>A private house was damaged as a result of falling debris from the downed targets, and power lines were cut, it added.</p>

<p>Since August 6, Ukraine has mounted an unprecedented cross-border assault into Russia's Kursk region, where it claims to control more than 80 settlements.</p>

<p>Kyiv has also repeatedly targeted oil and gas facilities in Russia since the conflict began in 2022, some hundreds of kilometres from its borders, in what it has called "fair" retaliation for massive attacks on its energy infrastructure.</p>

<p>Ukrainian drones attacked an oil storage facility in Russia's southern Rostov region on Sunday, sparking a large fire, the local governor said.</p>

<p>The blaze in the city of Proletarsk was still raging on Wednesday, Russian media reported.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky praised his forces for hitting oil facilities in Russia, saying the attacks would help bring a "just end" to the conflict.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel killed a senior member of the Palestinian movement in Lebanon on Wednesday, accusing him of orchestrating attacks in the West Bank.</p>

<p>In response, the assassinated operative's Fatah party accused Israel of seeking to "ignite a regional war".</p>

<p>Khalil Maqdah was killed in a strike on his car in the southern Lebanese city of Sidon, according to Fatah and a Lebanese security source.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said an air force "aircraft struck the terrorist Khalil Hussein Khalil Al-Maqdah in the area of Sidon in southern Lebanon."</p>

<p>The military said Maqdah was the brother of Mounir Maqdah, who heads the Lebanese branch of Fatah's armed wing, the Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades, and accused them both of "directing terror attacks and smuggling weapons" to the Israeli-occupied West Bank.</p>

<p>It alleged that the pair "collaborate on behalf of" Iran's Revolutionary Guards.</p>

<p>The attack marks the first such reported attack on a senior member of Fatah, the movement led by Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas, in more than 10 months of cross-border clashes between Israel and Lebanon's Hezbollah movement following the Gaza war.</p>

<p>Fatah said Maqdah had been killed "in a cowardly assassination carried out by ... Zionist (Israeli) warplanes on Sidon", describing him as "one of the leaders" of the Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades in Lebanon, the movement's armed wing.</p>

<p>In a statement, it said Maqdah had "a central role" in "supporting the Palestinian people and its resistance" during the Gaza war and an "important role in supporting resistance cells" for years in the West Bank.</p>

<p>A senior Fatah official in the West Bank city of Ramallah accused Israel of killing him in order to spark a regional war.</p>

<p>The "assassination of a Fatah official is further proof that Israel wants to ignite a full-scale war in the region," Tawfiq Tirawy, a member of Fatah's central committee, told AFP in Ramallah.</p>

<h3><strong>Fatah supporters rally</strong></h3>

<p>Maqdah was killed in a strike on a car, said Fathi Abu al-Aradat, a senior Lebanon-based member of the group that rivals Gaza's Palestinian Islamist rulers Hamas.</p>

<p>A Lebanese security source and Lebanon's official National News Agency reported the same information.</p>

<p>An AFP correspondent at the site of the attack said a car was struck near the Palestinian refugee camps of Ain al-Helweh and Mieh Mieh, adding that rescuers had pulled a body from the charred vehicle.</p>

<p>Dozens of angry Fatah supporters gathered inside the Ain al-Helweh camp, the AFP correspondent said, adding gunshots were fired in the air.</p>

<p>Hezbollah and its allies have exchanged regular fire with Israel in support of its ally Hamas since the Palestinian group's October 7 attack on Israel sparked the Gaza war.</p>

<p>The violence has killed some 593 people in Lebanon, mostly Hezbollah fighters but also including at least 130 civilians, according to AFP's tally.</p>

<p>On the Israeli side, including in the annexed Golan Heights, 23 soldiers and 26 civilians have been killed, according to army figures.</p>

<p>Fatah has not announced any attacks on Israel from Lebanon since clashes began nor has it mourned members killed by Israeli fire in Lebanon.</p>

<p>Hamas and Fatah have been bitter rivals since Hamas fighters ejected Fatah from the Gaza Strip after deadly clashes that followed Hamas's resounding victory in a 2006 election.</p>

<p>Fatah controls the Palestinian Authority, which has partial administrative control in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 116-year-old Japanese woman who used to be a mountaineer is set to be named the world's oldest person by Guinness World Records, a research group said on Wednesday, following the death of a 117-year-old Spanish woman earlier this week.</p>

<p>Tomiko Itooka, who was born on May 23, 1908, lives in the western Japanese city of Ashiya, the US-based Gerontology Research Group said.</p>

<p>She is next in line for the title of world's oldest person after Maria Branyas Morera died in a Spanish nursing home on Monday, according to the group.</p>

<p>Ms Itooka, a mother-of-three, was born in the year when a long-distance radio message was sent from the Eiffel Tower for the first time, and when the Wright Brothers made their first public flights in Europe and America.</p>

<p>In her 70s, Ms Itooka often went climbing and twice scaled Japan's 3,067-metre (10,062-ft) Mount Ontake - surprising her guide by climbing the mountain in sneakers instead of hiking boots, the research group said.</p>

<p>At the age of 100, she walked up the lengthy stone steps of Japan's Ashiya Shrine without using a cane, the group added.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two days ahead of his crucial visit to Ukrainian capital Kyiv, Prime Minister Narendra Modi today said he was looking forward to sharing perspectives with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on a peaceful resolution of the Ukraine conflict.</p>

<p>The prime minister's comments came shortly before he embarked on a two-nation trip to Poland and Ukraine. In the first leg of the visit, PM Modi is visiting Polish capital city Warsaw on August 21 and 22.</p>

<p>PM Modi will be in Kyiv for around seven hours on August 23 in the first visit by an Indian prime minister to Ukraine since the country became independent in 1991.</p>

<p>In a departure statement, PM Modi, referring to the Ukraine conflict, said that as a "friend and partner", India hopes for an early return of peace and stability in the region.</p>

<p>"From Poland, I will be visiting Ukraine at the invitation of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. This is the first-ever visit by an Indian Prime Minister to Ukraine," he said.</p>

<p>"I look forward to the opportunity to build upon earlier conversations with President Zelenskyy on strengthening bilateral cooperation and share perspectives on peaceful resolution of the ongoing Ukraine conflict," he said.</p>

<p>"As a friend and partner, we hope for an early return of peace and stability in the region," he added.</p>

<p>PM Modi said he was confident that his visit to Warsaw and Kyiv "will serve as a natural continuation of extensive contacts with the two countries and help create the foundation for stronger and more vibrant relations in the years ahead".</p>

<p>The prime minister will travel to Kyiv from Poland in a 'Rail Force One' train that will take around 10 hours. The return trip will also be of the same duration.</p>

<p>A number of world leaders including US President Joe Biden, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz visited Kyiv by train after the Russian invasion of Ukraine.</p>

<p>PM Modi's visit to Kyiv comes nearly six weeks after his high-profile trip to Moscow which triggered criticism from the US and some of its Western allies.</p>

<p>India has not yet condemned the Russian invasion of Ukraine and has been calling for resolution of the conflict through dialogue and diplomacy.</p>

<p>In his summit talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow last month, PM Modi said that a solution to the Ukraine conflict is not possible on the battlefield and peace talks do not succeed amidst bombs and bullets.</p>

<p>The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) on Monday said PM Modi's visit to Ukraine would be a "landmark and historic" one.</p>

<p>"Lasting peace can only be achieved through options that are acceptable to both parties. And it can only be a negotiated settlement," said Tanmaya Lal, Secretary (West) in the MEA.</p>

<p>"On our part, India continues to engage with all stakeholders," he said.</p>

<p>On his visit to Poland, PM Modi said he was looking forward to meeting Prime Minister Donald Tusk and President Andrzej Duda.</p>

<p>"My visit to Poland comes as we mark 70 years of our diplomatic relations. Poland is a key economic partner in Central Europe," he said.</p>

<p>"Our mutual commitment to democracy and pluralism further reinforces our relationship. I look forward to meeting my friend Prime Minister Donald Tusk and President Andrzej Duda to further advance our partnership," he said.</p>

<p>"I will also engage with the members of the vibrant Indian community in Poland," PM Modi said.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The marine weather phenomenon blamed for sinking a British tech tycoon's yacht off Sicily, known as a waterspout, may have been strengthened by unusually warm waters in the Mediterranean, experts said.</p>

<p>The 56-metre (183-foot) "Bayesian", being used by Mike Lynch and his wealthy guests to celebrate a court victory, disappeared into the sea within minutes of being hit by the tornado-like storm off the Sicilian town of Porticello.</p>

<p>One body has been found and Lynch, his daughter, and Jonathan Bloomer, chairman of Morgan Stanley International, are among six people <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/who-are-the-6-missing-in-luxury-yacht-disaster-off-sicily-6380645">missing</a> since the disaster at 4:00 am on Monday.</p>

<p>The British-flagged vessel was anchored some 700 metres from the port with 10 crew and 12 passengers on board when the waterspout struck, according to witnesses.</p>

<p>Karsten Borner, the skipper of a yacht anchored nearby, described a "very strong hurricane gust" that hit. He was battling to keep his vessel steady when suddenly "we noticed that the ship behind us was gone".</p>

<p>"First came the wind, then the water -- it was a tornado," said local fisherman Giovanni Lococco, describing the waterspout.</p>

<h3><strong>Tornado power</strong></h3>

<p>Investigators and experts have been poring over the weather conditions and the design of the "Bayesian", whose 75-metre mast was the world's tallest made from aluminium, according to the Charter World website.</p>

<p>"A waterspout is a narrow column of rotating air below a thunderstorm that occurs over water" and is "part of the same weather 'family' as tornadoes", said Peter Inness, a meteorologist at the University of Reading in Britain, in comments released by the UK's Science Media Centre.</p>

<p>Like tornadoes, they suck up air in a rotating motion, usually causing less damage than tornadoes over land, however.</p>

<p>"Changes in wind direction with height are also needed to set up the rotation of air within the waterspout," said Inness.</p>

<p>While many waterspouts are "fairly inconsequential", lasting just a few seconds, some can pack winds of more than 100 kilometres (62 miles) per hour, said Inness.</p>

<p>"Winds of this strength coinciding with the location of a boat are capable of causing damage or capsize, especially because the wind direction varies very rapidly," he said.</p>

<p>The Mediterranean could be the world's most likely place for waterspouts, due to a warm water surface and a vulnerability to thunderstorms in the summer and autumn, he said.</p>

<p>The Mediterranean this year reached its highest temperature on record, with a daily median of 28.90 degrees Celsius (84 Fahrenheit), according to Spain's leading institute of marine sciences.</p>

<p>Experts say the temperature has often hit 30 degrees Celsius or more, about three degrees above average.</p>

<p>"We could have had a superposition of air and water suction with shearing winds that ultimately created something that lifted up," said Jean-Marie Dumon, a former naval officer now with the GICAN, the French maritime industry association.</p>

<p>The conditions with winds of 100kph or more can "create completely anarchic sea conditions which can cause capsizing," said Dumon.</p>

<p>The tall mast may have had an "amplifier effect" in taking the yacht to its "tipping point", he explained.</p>

<p>Dumon said the "Bayesian" was certainly designed by naval architects to cope with extreme winds and heavy seas.</p>

<p>"Here we have wind shear which can cause instability."</p>

<p>"The fact that the vessel itself was not damaged... suggests that it was laid on its side", said the expert.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The child gained access to a gun and unintentionally shot the man, leaving him in critical condition.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a shocking incident, a two-year-old child accidentally shot a man Monday morning in a Chesterfield County, Virginia home. According to <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/man-critical-condition-after-shot-2-year/story?id=112995896">ABC News</a></em>, the child&nbsp;gained access to a gun and unintentionally shot the man, leaving him in critical condition.</p>

<p>The incident happened on August 19, when police responded to a reported shooting at a residence in the 4400 block of Butler Lane around 10 a.m. Upon arrival, officers found the victim with a gunshot wound and immediately provided medical attention. The man was subsequently airlifted to the hospital for further treatment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Chesterfield Police later confirmed some details to <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59vV8TxMaHY">CBS 6 News</a></em>.</p>

<p>''It appears that the following events occurred: The victim was preparing to leave the house and had placed his handgun on a nearby chair when a child, who is nearly 3 years old, retrieved the gun. The child accidentally discharged the firearm, shooting the victim. The child was not injured and no one else in the house was injured. Again, the investigation is ongoing,'' a Chesterfield Police spokesperson said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to Virginia ABC affiliate&nbsp;<em><a data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.wric.com/news/local-news/chesterfield-county/police-say-2-year-old-accidentally-shoots-man-in-chesterfield-home/" target="_blank">WRIC</a>,</em> the victim is the boyfriend of the child's mother.</p>

<p>Neighbour Lisa Wood said she saw the child shortly after the shooting.</p>

<p>"After I went into the house, he was sitting there like a normal kid. It's not like, you know, he's worried, or, you know, anything like that. He still has a smile," she said.</p>

<p>Other neighbours who spoke with<em> CBS 6</em> expressed their wishes for the victim's full recovery and agreed that the incident serves as a stark reminder of the crucial importance of gun safety measures.&nbsp;</p>

<p>''Bad things happen whenever you're not responsible with your stuff. And it, really, really sucks that it had to be a child. And, you know, hopefully, this adult will pull through because, like, this — this sucks. Today was just a day that, you know, that wasn't good,'' Ms Wood said.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[A 40-year-old Indian doctor was held in a US jail on a USD 2 million bond after being charged with multiple sex crimes for allegedly recording hundreds of nude images and videos of children and women over several years, according to media reports.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 40-year-old Indian doctor was held in a US jail on a USD 2 million bond after being charged with multiple sex crimes for allegedly recording hundreds of nude images and videos of children and women over several years, according to media reports.</p>

<p>Oumair Aejaz was arrested earlier on August 8 after he allegedly placed hidden cameras in a variety of settings from bathrooms, changing areas, hospital rooms, and even his own home where he would record children as young as 2 years old in varying states of undress, Fox News reported.</p>

<p>Authorities became aware of his offences after his wife came forward with disturbing materials. Before his arrest, he had no criminal history.</p>

<p>He also allegedly recorded sexual encounters with numerous women who were unconscious or asleep, the Oakland County Sheriff said on Tuesday.</p>

<p>The magnitude of Aejaz's offences is not currently known, but Sheriff Mike Bouchard said it will take months to fully investigate. Authorities suspect there could be many more victims as investigators review thousands of videos found at his home in Rochester Hills, a city in Oakland County in the US state of Michigan.</p>

<p>"The victimisation is so broad and the perversion so great, we're just beginning to wrap our arms around it," he said. "Disturbing on so many levels." He equated the scale of criminality to Larry Nasser, the disgraced sports doctor convicted of abusing dozens of young women in his care.</p>

<p>Several search warrants have been served since Aejaz was arrested on August 8 at his home. They include computers, phones, and 15 external devices. Bouchard said a single hard drive had 13,000 videos on it.</p>

<p>He may have uploaded videos into cloud storage as well.</p>

<p>Aejaz was charged on August 13 with one count of child sexually abusive activity, four counts of capturing an image of an unclothed person and five counts of using a computer to commit a crime and is being held in the Oakland County Jail on a USD 2 million bond, Detroit Free Press reported.</p>

<p>Oakland County Prosecutor Karen McDonald said Aejaz's wife produced materials earlier this month that were concerning and the sheriff's office immediately executed a search warrant and confiscated more devices. She said investigators have "sifted through really jarring, alarming images" and continue to do so.</p>

<p>McDonald said Aejaz also preyed on well-respected institutions and hospitals, which she said have been cooperative.</p>

<p>Many of the allegations stem from Aejaz allegedly recording a mother and her kids inside a changing room at the Goldfish Swimming Club in 2023. However, he is also believed to have assaulted patients inside hospital rooms.</p>

<p>"These are children and moms at a swim school," McDonald said. "They're there to teach their kids to swim. Because that brings their kids joy and because they want their kids to be safe around water. They were victimised by a person of trust in the community – a medical doctor." His work history shows he was employed at Henry Ford Macomb Hospital in Clinton Township and Ascension Genesys Hospital in Grand Blanc. His current employment was as a physician contracted with a company that would send him to different hospitals.</p>

<p>Before that, he moved to the US in 2011 on a work visa from India, where he is a citizen. His residency took place at Sinai Grace Hospital before spending time in Alabama. He returned to Michigan in 2018.</p>

<p>Due to the number of victims and the difficulty identifying them, police have provided an email that people can use to contact the authorities.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

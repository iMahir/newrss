       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Indian links of some US presidential election contenders probably mean little additional benefit for ties, experts said, against the backdrop of bipartisan support for closer relations with New Delhi to counter an assertive China.</p>

<p>Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris and Usha Chilukuri Vance, the wife of Republican Donald Trump's running-mate, have rarely visited the birthplace of one or both of their parents, although Indians take pride in their success.</p>

<p>"Either way, from India's perspective, whether it is Republican or Democrat, that relationship enjoys bipartisan support and should not be affected," said Harsh Vardhan Shringla, a former Indian ambassador to the United States.</p>

<p>"It can only benefit," he said of the India links, adding, "(It) cannot be affected adversely."</p>

<p>Since ties with New Delhi are viewed favourably by both parties in Washington, there will be little impact on relations, regardless of which party wins, or the candidate's Indian roots, a government official said on condition of anonymity.</p>

<p>Both President Joe Biden and Trump, his predecessor in office, sought to woo India, not just to challenge China in the region, but also to wean New Delhi from a traditional dependence on Russian weapons.</p>

<h3>ROLE MODEL</h3>

<p>Both Harris and Usha Vance, the wife of Republican vice presidential candidate, JD Vance have links to southern India. Vance belongs to a family of renowned academics.</p>

<p>Harris, who has garnered the backing of enough delegates to secure the Democratic nomination, is viewed as role model in her mother's ancestral village of Thulasendrapuram.</p>

<p>She has "proven how young women, previously confined to their homes, can reach such heights, becoming a public figure in the world's No. 1 country," said J Sudhakar, a resident of the village where Harris' maternal grandfather was born.</p>

<p>"How big an achievement is that?"</p>

<p>Harris, who visited the village as a five-year-old, has recalled walks with her grandfather on the beach of the city of Chennai where the family later lived, about 320 km from the village of roughly 2,000 people.</p>

<p>But she has not been back since becoming US vice president.</p>

<p>"Residents expected a visit, a statement or at least a mention of the village, but that didn't happen," said shopkeeper G. Manikandan.</p>

<p>"But we will invite her when she wins and organise a grand celebration and welcome for her," he added.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel convened its security cabinet on Sunday to discuss responding to a rocket strike in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights that killed 12 teenagers and children, and which Israel and the United States blamed on Lebanese armed group Hezbollah.</p>

<p>Hezbollah denied responsibility for the attack on Majdal Shams, the deadliest in Israel or Israeli-annexed territory since Palestinian group Hamas' Oct. 7 assault sparked the war in Gaza. That conflict has spread to several fronts and risks spilling into a wider regional conflict.</p>

<p>Israeli jets hit targets in southern Lebanon during the day but a stronger response could follow the security meeting in Tel Aviv convened by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu after his return from a visit to Washington.</p>

<p>Israel has vowed retaliation against Hezbollah in Lebanon.</p>

<p>The White House on Sunday also blamed Hezbollah for the Majdal Shams strike. "This attack was conducted by Lebanese Hezbollah. It was their rocket, and launched from an area they control," it said in a statement.</p>

<p>The U.S. said Washington has been in discussions with Israeli and Lebanese counterparts since Saturday's attack, which it condemned and described as "horrific," and that it was working on a diplomatic solution.</p>

<p>U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Washington stood by Israel's right to defend itself, but that it did not want further escalation of the conflict, which has seen daily exchanges of fire between the Israeli military and Hezbollah along the border.</p>

<p>Britain expressed concern at further escalation while Egypt said the attack could spill "into a comprehensive regional war."</p>

<p>On the ground, thousands of people gathered for funerals in the Druze village of Majdal Shams in the Golan Heights, territory captured from Syria by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war and annexed in a move not recognised by most countries.</p>

<p>Members of the Druze faith, which is related to Islam, Christianity and Judaism, make up more than half the 40,000-strong population of the Golan Heights. Large crowds of mourners, many in traditional high white and red Druze headwear, surrounded the caskets as they were carried through the village.</p>

<p>"A heavy tragedy, a dark day has come to Majdal Shams," said Dolan Abu Saleh, head of the Majdal Shams local council, in comments broadcast on Israeli television.</p>

<p>Hezbollah initially had announced it fired rockets at Israeli military sites in the Golan Heights, but said it had "absolutely nothing" to do with the attack on Majdal Shams.</p>

<h3>ISRAEL SAYS ROCKET IRANIAN-MADE</h3>

<p>However, Israel said the rocket was an Iranian-made missile fired from an area north of the village of Chebaa in southern Lebanon, placing the blame squarely on Iranian-backed Hezbollah.</p>

<p>It was not immediately clear if the children and teenagers killed in the strike were Israeli citizens, but Israeli officials have vowed retaliation.</p>

<p>"The rocket that murdered our boys and girls was an Iranian rocket and Hezbollah is the only terror organization which has those in its arsenal," Israel's foreign ministry said.</p>

<p>Two security sources told Reuters Hezbollah was on high alert and had cleared out some key sites in both Lebanon's south and the eastern Bekaa Valley in case of an Israeli attack.</p>

<p>Lebanon's Middle East Airlines said it was delaying the arrival of some flights from Sunday night to Monday morning, without stating why.</p>

<p>In the southern port city of Tyre, a little over 20 km (12 miles) from the border, beachgoers were still streaming to the coast. "There's fear that Israel will react, but people are living their life normally," said Ali Husseini, manager of a beachside business in Tyr.</p>

<p>Israeli forces have been exchanging fire for months with Hezbollah fighters in southern Lebanon but both sides have appeared to be avoiding an escalation that could lead to all-out war, potentially dragging in other powers including the United States and Iran.</p>

<p>However, Saturday's strike threatened to tip the standoff into a more dangerous phase. United Nations officials urged maximum restraint from both sides, warning that escalation could "engulf the entire region in a catastrophe beyond belief."</p>

<p>Lebanon has asked the U.S to urge restraint from Israel, Lebanon's foreign minister Abdallah Bou Habib told Reuters. Bou Habib said the U.S. had asked Lebanon's government to pass on a message to Hezbollah to show restraint as well.</p>

<h3>ALL-OUT WAR FEARED</h3>

<p>Iran's foreign ministry warned Israel on Sunday against what it called any new adventure in Lebanon.</p>

<p>Syria's foreign ministry said it held Israel "fully responsible for this dangerous escalation in the region" and said its accusations against Hezbollah were false.</p>

<p>Two diplomats focused on Lebanon said all efforts were now needed to avoid an all-out war.</p>

<p>The conflict has forced tens of thousands of people in both Lebanon and Israel to leave their homes. Israeli strikes have killed some 350 Hezbollah fighters in Lebanon and more than 100 civilians, including medics, children and journalists.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said after Saturday's attack the death count among civilians killed in Hezbollah attacks had risen to 23 since October, along with at least 17 soldiers.</p>

<p>Hezbollah is the most powerful of a network of Iran-backed groups across the Middle East and opened a second front against Israel shortly after Hamas' Oct. 7 assault.</p>

<p>Iraqi groups and the Houthis of Yemen have both fired at Israel, which earlier this month attacked the Red Sea port of Hodeidah in retaliation for a strike on Tel Aviv that killed one person. Hamas has also carried out rocket attacks on Israel from Lebanon, as has the Lebanese Sunni group, the Jama'a Islamiya.</p>

<p>Druze communities live on both sides of the line between southern Lebanon and northern Israel as well as in the Golan Heights and Syria. While some serve in the Israeli military and identify with Israel, many feel marginalized in Israel and some also reject Israeli citizenship.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The White House said Sunday that rocket fire that killed 12 young people in the Israeli-annexed Golan Heights was "conducted by Lebanese Hezbollah."</p>

<p>Calling the attack "horrific," National Security Council Spokeswoman Adrienne Watson said in a statement that "it was their rocket, and launched from an area they control. It should be universally condemned."</p>

<p>The Israeli military has said the youths were struck on Saturday by an Iranian-made rocket carrying a 50-kilogram (110-pound) warhead that Lebanon's Iran-backed Hezbollah group fired at a football field in the Druze Arab town of Majdal Shams.</p>

<p>"Our support for Israel's security is ironclad and unwavering against all Iran-backed threats, including Hezbollah," Watson said.</p>

<p>"We have been in continuous discussions with Israeli and Lebanese counterparts since the horrific attack," she added.</p>

<p>Vice President Kamala Harris, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, also condemned the attack in language similar to that used by the White House.</p>

<p>Harris "has been briefed and is closely monitoring Hezbollah's horrific attack on a soccer field in Majdal Shams," her NSC advisor Phil Gordon wrote on X.</p>

<p>"She condemns this horrific attack and mourns for all those killed and wounded."</p>

<p>Hezbollah has said it had no connection to the incident.</p>

<p>The group has described its past cross-border fire as an act of support for Palestinian Islamists from Hamas who have been fighting Israel's military in Gaza since October 7, when they attacked southern Israel.</p>

<p>The violence since then has killed at least 527 people in Lebanon, according to an AFP tally, most of them fighters but also including 104 civilians.</p>

<p>On the Israeli side, 22 soldiers and 24 civilians have been killed in the cross-border action, according to Israeli authorities.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jailed former prime minister Imran Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party on Sunday announced its plans to hold a countrywide protest next month on the completion of one year of the arrest of the party's founder, demanding his immediate release and a relief for inflation-broken masses.</p>

<p>The 71-year-old former cricketer-turned politician was arrested from his residence in Lahore on August 5 last year after he was convicted in the Toshakhana case which was filed by the Election Commission of Pakistan against him for hiding sale of gifts he got from the state repository.</p>

<p>Former National Assembly speaker Asad Qaiser said that the final decision regarding the protests would be made at the party meeting but they were planning for large demonstrations across the country on August 5.</p>

<p>"On August 5, we will hold rallies and large demonstrations across Pakistan on two issues. First of all, August 5 is the day of Imran Khan's arrest, he was illegally arrested in a fabricated case," he said at a press conference.</p>

<p>He added that there will also be protests against inflation and the imprisonment of other Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf members.</p>

<p>He urged the public to join the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf protest call against inflation and the illegal arrest of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf founder.</p>

<p>Imran Khan's arrest in the Toshakhana case was later suspended by the Islamabad High Court but he was not released and arrested in other cases. He is still incarcerated in Rawalpindi's high-security Adiala Jail.</p>

<p>Qaiser also condemned the alleged official crackdown on the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf lawmakers and supporters, questioning the dignity of Parliament if lawmakers were being humiliated.</p>

<p>He demanded the withdrawal of baseless cases against Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf members and threatened to launch nationwide sit-ins for which he also invited all parties to join them, declaring the current government as fake.</p>

<p>Qaisar alleged that independent candidates who won with the support of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf were being pressured to change loyalty and switch sides. He urged the Supreme Court to take suo motu cognisance.</p>

<p>Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf secretary general Omar Ayub Khan said that party-backed lawmakers were being picked up by agencies and implicated in cases of alleged corruption.</p>

<p>He also accused the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) of trying to create a wedge between the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf and the army to create conflict. He suggested that immediate fresh elections were the only solution to the political turmoil.</p>

<p>The decision to hold a protest on the first anniversary of Imran Khan's arrest comes after the party failed to stage a protest in Islamabad on Friday after the authorities had banned such demonstrations in the national capital.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Hezbollah has evacuated positions in south and east Lebanon after Israeli threats of reprisals for a deadly strike on the annexed Golan Heights, a source close to the group said Sunday.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hezbollah has evacuated positions in south and east Lebanon after Israeli threats of reprisals for a deadly strike on the annexed Golan Heights, a source close to the group said Sunday.</p>

<p>Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant vowed to "hit the enemy hard" a day after rocket fire from Lebanon killed 12 young people in Majdal Shams, again raisings fears that the war in Gaza will spread.</p>

<p>Israel blamed Lebanon's Hezbollah movement for firing a Falaq-1 Iranian rocket but the Iran-backed group -- which has regularly targeted Israeli military positions -- said it had "no connection" to the incident.</p>

<p>"Hezbollah has evacuated some positions in the south and in the Bekaa valley that it thinks could be a target for Israel," the source close to the group told AFP, requesting anonymity as they were not authorised to speak to the media.</p>

<p>Hezbollah has a strong presence in east Lebanon's Bekaa valley, which borders Syria, and in south Lebanon, where it has been launching near daily attacks on Israeli positions since October in support of ally Hamas.</p>

<p>The cross-border exchanges of fire have largely been limited to the border area, but Israel has repeatedly struck deep inside Lebanon, including overnight.</p>

<p>Hezbollah is also deployed in Syria, where for years it has been fighting in support of President Bashar al-Assad in his country's civil war.</p>

<p>The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a war monitor, said pro-Iran groups and Hezbollah-affiliated fighters have "evacuated their positions" south of the capital and in the Damascus countryside, as well as in parts of the Syrian-controlled Golan Heights, in anticipation of "potential Israeli airstrikes".</p>

<p>Hezbollah had already abandoned positions in Syria in early June after Israeli raids, according to the Britain-based Observatory, which relies on a network of sources inside Syria.</p>

<p>Since Syria's civil war erupted in 2011, Israel has carried out hundreds of strikes in the country, mainly targeting army positions and Iran-backed fighters, including from Hezbollah.</p>

<p>The raids also seek to cut off Hezbollah supply routes to Lebanon.</p>

<p>Israeli authorities rarely comment on individual strikes in Syria, but have repeatedly said they will not allow arch-enemy Iran to expand its presence there.</p>

<p>Israel's raids on Syria intensified after Palestinian militant group Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel sparked war in the Gaza Strip, then eased after an April 1 strike blamed on Israel hit the Iranian consular building in Damascus.</p>

<p>That strike prompted Iran to launch a first-ever direct missile and drone attack against Israel on April 13-14, sending regional tensions skyrocketing.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The 100-day sprint to the US election began Sunday, the final act of a campaign transformed by an assassination attempt and the stunning exit of President Joe Biden.</p>

<p>After weeks of infighting and despondency over Biden's candidacy, Democrats have consolidated behind Vice President Kamala Harris, radically reshaping the race to November 5 that was fast becoming Republican nominee Donald Trump's to lose.</p>

<p>Harris's candidacy has clearly reinvigorated the Democratic campaign, which said Sunday it had raised $200 million -- mostly from first-time donors -- since Biden dropped out and endorsed his vice president a week ago.</p>

<p>A new Wall Street Journal poll showed Harris had closed Biden's six-point deficit with Trump to just two points -- well within the margin of error -- with boosted support from Black, Latino and young voters.</p>

<p>But Republican pollster David Lee, who conducted the Journal survey, cautioned Democrats not to get carried away by the race tightening.</p>

<p>"Donald Trump is in a far better position in this election when compared to a similar time in the 2020 election," Lee said.</p>

<p>If the race is at a dead heat nationally, the advantage still lies with Trump given the mathematics of the Electoral College system for electing the president.</p>

<p>Trump's 2016 victory over Hillary Clinton came despite losing the country-wide popular vote by nearly three million ballots.</p>

<h3><strong>'We are the underdogs'</strong></h3>

<p>"We are the underdogs in this race," Harris acknowledged at a fundraising event on Saturday.</p>

<p>"But this is a people-powered campaign and we have momentum," she added.</p>

<p>The Democratic convention in mid-August will seek to keep that momentum going with a jubilant celebration of Harris's candidacy.</p>

<p>It all looked so different just a month ago.</p>

<p>Dogged by voters' concerns about his age and mental acuity, the 81-year-old Biden was an outside bet at best, trailing his predecessor in the first presidential rematch since Dwight Eisenhower trounced Adlai Stevenson in 1956.</p>

<p>Biden's dismal June 27 debate showing ignited alarm and panic within his party.</p>

<p>The flames were fanned by a flawless show of unity behind 78-year-old Trump at the Republican national convention -- an event galvanized by the failed bid, just days earlier, to assassinate the former president at a rally in Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>After an initial show of defiance, Biden bowed to the inevitable and dropped out last weekend.</p>

<p>Harris, a generation younger at 59, threw her hat in the ring -- turning what had been a stale contest between two unpopular, aging, white male candidates into a dynamic and unpredictable showdown.</p>

<p>The final result on November 5 will likely be determined by around 100,000 independent, undecided voters in a handful of battleground states that both campaigns will target exhaustively over the coming three months.</p>

<h3><strong>The Harris honeymoon</strong></h3>

<p>The challenge for Harris is substantial. Once the Republicans have adapted to her candidacy and honed their attack lines, they are set to hammer her over key voter issues such as immigration and rising prices.</p>

<p>Democratic strategist James Carville told MSNBC that Democrats needed to cut the happy talk and prepare for the coming storm.</p>

<p>"They're coming at us and they're going to keep coming. And this kind of giddy elation is not going to be very helpful much longer because that's now what we're going to be faced with," he said.</p>

<p>Even former president Barack Obama has cautioned against hubris, underlining Harris's underdog status and the need for her to earn the trust of voters.</p>

<p>Trump, who has seen his favorability ratings tick upward since the July 13 attempt on his life and the successful Republican convention, made his attack priorities clear at a rally Saturday in the traditionally Democratic state of Minnesota.</p>

<p>Labelling Harris a "crazy liberal" and a "radical left lunatic," Trump lied to make her sound like an extremist on abortion and made fun of her laugh.</p>

<p>"We have a brand-new victim," he told his cheering supporters.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Golan Heights, a rocky plateau where 12 youths were killed Saturday amid clashes between Lebanon's Hezbollah and Israeli forces, is a strategic territory partially captured by Israel from Syria.</p>

<p>Following the conquest of about two-thirds of the plateau during the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, Israel 1981 annexed the area in a move not recognised by the international community, with the exception of the United States since 2019.</p>

<p>Rich in water, the Golan Heights overlooks northern Israel's Galilee region and the Sea of Galilee and dominates the route to Damascus on the Syrian-controlled side.</p>

<h3><strong>Annexation&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>The Golan, the region's biblical Hebrew name, or Jawlan in Arabic, has been coveted by empires and foreign rulers for millennia.</p>

<p>It was occupied by Herod, the Franks, the Ottomans and others, and eventually made part of Syria which gained its independence from the French in 1946.</p>

<p>Most of the territory was captured by Israel on June 9, 1967, after fierce battles with the Syrian army which had been shelling Israeli positions below.</p>

<p>An additional pocket of about 510 square kilometres (nearly 200 square miles) was seized by Israel during the 1973 war, but was returned to Syria the following year under an armistice agreement along with a small part of the area occupied in 1967.</p>

<p>The 1974 agreement created a demilitarised buffer zone, and since then a UN observer force has been monitoring the ceasefire line on the Golan Heights.</p>

<p>Approximately 1,200 square kilometres of the Golan Heights, which also borders Lebanon and Jordan, were annexed by Israel on December 14, 1981.</p>

<p>Tens of thousands of Syrian as well as Palestinian residents fled or were expelled from the Golan Heights when Israel seized it, though some remained in the Israeli-controlled part.</p>

<p>Today, about 25,000 Israeli settlers live there alongside some 23,000 members of the Druze community, which follows an offshoot of Shiite Islam.</p>

<p>The Golan Druze largely identify as Syrian while having resident status, rather than citizenship, in Israel.</p>

<h3><strong>Water</strong></h3>

<p>The volcanic plateau is home to significant water sources such as the Banyas, which feeds the Jordan River.</p>

<p>The Hasbani Stream, which finds it origin in Lebanon, flows through the Golan Heights before emptying into the Jordan, as does the Dan Stream.</p>

<p>In the 1990s, Israeli-Syrian peace negotiations stalled over the issue of the Golan, with Damascus demanding the territory's complete return up to the shores of the Sea of Galilee.</p>

<p>Apple production is a key source of income for farmers on the Golan Heights, though its rocky areas limit agricultural cultivation.</p>

<p>In the years preceding the 1967 war, the issue of water resources on the Golan was a major point of contention between Israel and Syria.</p>

<h3><strong>Conflict&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Israel and Syria remain officially in a state of war, though the ceasefire line has remained relatively calm over the decades.</p>

<p>Tensions have built up as Lebanon's Hezbollah armed group and Iran, two regional foes of Israel, grew closer to the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.</p>

<p>Since the Syrian war broke out in 2011, Israel has struck its northern neighbour hundreds of times, mainly targeting army positions and Iran-backed fighters including from Hezbollah.</p>

<p>But tensions soared since Hamas's October 7 attack on southern Israel triggered the ongoing war in the Gaza Strip.</p>

<p>Hamas ally Hezbollah, which has traded regular cross-border fire with Israeli forces since October 8, has launched rockets at the Golan Heights several times.</p>

<p>The Lebanese group says its attacks on Israel are in support of Hamas.</p>

<p>While Israel has evacuated most towns and villages along its border with Lebanon in the wake of the near-daily clashes, residents of the Golan area have remained there.</p>

<p>Israeli authorities said 12 children and teenagers, aged between 10 and 16 years, were killed by a Hezbollah rocket that hit the Druze town of Majdal Shams on Saturday.</p>

<p>Hezbollah, which claimed numerous attacks on Israeli positions that day in response to a deadly raid on southern Lebanon, has denied responsibility.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on Sunday held "wide-ranging" talks with his American counterpart Antony Blinken against the backdrop of an unease in India-US ties following Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Russia three weeks back.</p>

<p>Mr Jaishankar and Blinken are in Tokyo to attend a meeting of foreign ministers of the four-nation grouping Quad or Quadrilateral coalition on Monday.</p>

<p>The talks between the external affairs minister and the US secretary of state also came amid Washington consistently seeking accountability from New Delhi in the case relating to the alleged foiled plot to kill Khalistani terrorist Gurupatwant Singh Pannun in New York.</p>

<p>It is not immediately clear whether Prime Minister Modi's visit to Russia and the murder-for-hire plot figured in the Jaishankar-Blinken talks.</p>

<p>In a post on 'X', Mr Jaishankar said he and Blinken had a wide-ranging discussion on regional and global issues.</p>

<p>"Great to catch up with@SecBlinken in Tokyo today," he said.</p>

<p>"Our bilateral agenda progresses steadily. Also had a wide-ranging discussion on regional and global issues," Mr Jaishankar added.</p>

<p>It is learnt that the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the overall situation in Gaza figured in the talks.</p>

<p>The US and several of its allies were outraged over the timing of Modi's July 8 to 9 visit to Moscow as it coincided with the NATO summit in Washington. Some Western capitals were also learnt to be peeved over Modi choosing Russia for his first bilateral trip in his third term.</p>

<p>US Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asia Donald Lu told a US Congressional hearing on Tuesday that the US was disappointed by the "symbolism" and "timing" of Modi's visit to Russia.</p>

<p>The Biden administration official especially highlighted that the Indian prime minister paid the visit to Moscow when Washington was hosting a summit of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO).</p>

<p>New Delhi on Thursday rejected Lu's comments and asserted that all countries have the "freedom of choice" in a multipolar world and everyone should be mindful of such realities.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, India and Ukraine are planning a visit to Kyiv by the Indian prime minister next month.</p>

<p>The India-US ties also came under some unease following the alleged murder-for-hire plot.</p>

<p>In November last year, US federal prosecutors charged Indian national Nikhil Gupta with working with an Indian government employee in the foiled plot to kill Pannun in New York.</p>

<p>Pannun, wanted in India on terror charges, holds dual citizenship of the US and Canada.</p>

<p>Nikhil Gupta, who was arrested in the Czech Republic in June last year, was extradited to the US last month.</p>

<p>Following the allegations by the US, India appointed a high-level inquiry committee to look into the inputs provided by the US on the plot.</p>

<p>In April, The Washington Post named an Indian official for the alleged plot.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A deadly rocket strike in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights has added to concerns that Israel and the Iran-backed Lebanese group Hezbollah could be sucked into a full-scale war - something they have both previously indicated they want to avoid but for which they have also said they are ready.</p>

<p>Israel said on Sunday it would strike hard at Hezbollah after accusing the group of killing 12 children and teenagers in a rocket attack on a football field in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. Hezbollah denied any responsibility for the attack on Majdal Shams, the deadliest in Israel or Israeli-annexed territory since Hamas' Oct. 7 assault sparked the war in Gaza.</p>

<p>This is the background to hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah:</p>

<h3><strong>Why Are They Fighting?</strong></h3>

<p>Hezbollah began trading fire with Israel on Oct. 8, a day after the Palestinian group Hamas attacked communities in southern Israel and sparked the Gaza war.</p>

<p>Hezbollah, a Hamas ally, says its attacks aim to support Palestinians who are under Israeli bombardment in Gaza.</p>

<p>The Gaza war has drawn in Iran-backed operatives across the region. Hezbollah is widely deemed the most powerful member of the Iran-backed network, known as the Axis of Resistance.</p>

<p>Hezbollah has said repeatedly it will not halt its attacks on Israel unless a ceasefire in Gaza comes into force.</p>

<p>While linked to Gaza, the conflict has its own dynamics.</p>

<p>Israel and Hezbollah have fought numerous wars.</p>

<p>The last was in 2006.</p>

<p>Israel has long viewed Hezbollah as the biggest threat at its borders and has been deeply alarmed by its growing arsenal, and the foothold it has established in Syria.</p>

<p>Hezbollah's ideology is largely defined by conflict with Israel. It was founded by Iran's Revolutionary Guards in 1982 to fight Israeli forces that had invaded Lebanon that year, and waged years of guerrilla war that led Israel to withdraw from south Lebanon in 2000.</p>

<p>Hezbollah deems Israel an illegitimate state established on occupied Palestinian lands and wants to see it gone.</p>

<h3><strong>What's The Impact So Far?</strong></h3>

<p>The current conflict has already taken a toll on both sides.</p>

<p>Tens of thousands of people have been forced to flee their homes on both sides of the border. Israeli airstrikes have pounded areas where Hezbollah operates in southern Lebanon and struck the Bekaa Valley near the Syrian border.</p>

<p>Israel has also occasionally hit elsewhere, notably killing a senior Hamas commander in Beirut on Jan. 2.</p>

<p>Israeli strikes have killed some 350 Hezbollah fighters in Lebanon and more than 100 civilians, including medics, children and journalists, according to security and medical sources and a Reuters tally of death notifications issued by Hezbollah.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said after Saturday's attack the death count among civilians killed in Hezbollah attacks had risen to 23 since October, along with at least 17 soldiers. Hezbollah denied it was responsible for Saturday's attack.</p>

<p>In Israel, the displacement of so many Israelis is a big political issue. Officials had hoped they would be able to go home for the school year beginning Sept. 1 but that has looked increasingly unlikely as the standoff has continued.</p>

<h3><strong>How Much Worse Could It Get?</strong></h3>

<p>A lot. Despite the ferocity of these hostilities, this is still seen as a relatively contained confrontation.</p>

<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned in December that Beirut would be turned "into Gaza" if Hezbollah started an all-out war.</p>

<p>Hezbollah has previously signalled it is not seeking to widen the conflict while also saying it is ready to fight any war imposed on it and warning that it has used only a small part of its capabilities so far.</p>

<p>Any move by Israel to expand the conflict would be met by "devastation, destruction and displacement" in Israel, Hezbollah deputy leader Sheikh Naim Qassem said in an interview with Al Jazeera in June.</p>

<p>Past wars have inflicted heavy damage.</p>

<p>In 2006, Israeli strikes levelled large areas of Beirut's Hezbollah-controlled southern suburbs, knocked out Beirut airport, and hit roads, bridges and other infrastructure. Nearly 1 million people in Lebanon fled their homes.</p>

<p>In Israel, the impact included 300,000 people fleeing their homes to escape Hezbollah rockets and some 2,000 homes destroyed.</p>

<p>Hezbollah has a far bigger arsenal than in 2006, including rockets it says can hit all parts of Israel.</p>

<p>It has demonstrated advances in its weaponry since October, shooting down Israeli drones, launching its own explosive drones into Israel, and firing more sophisticated guided missiles.</p>

<p>Israeli troops have invaded Lebanon several times in the past, reaching as far as Beirut in the 1982 invasion that aimed to crush Lebanon-based Palestinian guerrillas.</p>

<h3><strong>Is Escalation Avoidable?</strong></h3>

<p>Much will depend on what happens in Gaza, where efforts to agree a ceasefire and a return of Israeli hostages have faltered. A ceasefire there could help bring about a rapid de-escalation of tensions in southern Lebanon.</p>

<p>The United States, which deems Hezbollah a terrorist group, has been at the heart of diplomatic efforts aimed at easing the conflict.</p>

<p>Hezbollah has signalled its eventual openness to an agreement that benefits Lebanon, but has said there can be no discussions until Israel halts the Gaza offensive.</p>

<p>Israel has also said it would prefer a diplomatic settlement that would restore security in the north, but says it is also prepared for a military offensive to achieve the same goal.</p>

<p>The U.S. official at the heart of diplomatic contacts, Amos Hochstein, brokered an unlikely diplomatic deal between Lebanon and Israel in 2022 over their disputed maritime boundary.</p>

<p>Hochstein said on May 30 he did not expect peace between Hezbollah and Israel but that a set of understandings could remove some of the impetus for conflict and establish a recognised border between Lebanon and Israel.</p>

<p>A French proposal submitted to Beirut in February included elite Hezbollah fighters withdrawing 10 km (6 miles) from the frontier and negotiations aimed at settling disputes over the land border.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The mobile internet connection was restored in Bangladesh on Sunday, 10 days after it was restricted by the authorities across the country to stop the spread of fake news on social media amidst the deadly nationwide violence over reforms in the quota system in government jobs.</p>

<p>Addressing a press conference, Minister of State for Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Zunaid Ahmed Palak announced that 5GB internet will be given for free to all users for three days after the connection is restored, the Dhaka Tribune newspaper reported.</p>

<p>The mobile internet connectivity was restored at around 3:00 pm local time.</p>

<p>Users of Robi, Grameenphone, Banglalink and other operators in Dhaka said they could access the internet through their phones around 3 pm, the report said.</p>

<p>On July 18, the government shut down mobile internet following the escalation of violence across the country.</p>

<p>At the time, Palak said the decision was made "in light of the current crisis in the country and to stop the spread of fake news on social media", The Daily Star newspaper reported.</p>

<p>The next day, amid escalating violence, the Department of Disaster Management building was set on fire, adjacent to which was a data centre. While Internet Service Providers Association of Bangladesh (ISPAB) officials said that the fire might cut 30-40 per cent of the bandwidth supply, broadband internet connection for the entire country was disrupted within an hour.</p>

<p>Bangladesh stayed disconnected from both broadband and mobile internet between July 18 and July 23, when broadband internet was restored in stages.</p>

<p>However, mobile internet remained unavailable until Sunday.</p>

<p>Regarding access to social media platforms, Palak said the Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (BTRC) has sent letters to authorities of social media platforms, including Facebook, Tiktok and YouTube.</p>

<p>"Their representatives have to come to Dhaka by July 31 to give explanations. Then, after discussing it with them, we will make a decision," he said.</p>

<p>The BTRC is responsible for regulating all matters related to telecommunications in Bangladesh.</p>

<p>Bangladesh witnessed violent clashes between the police and mostly student protesters demanding an end to a controversial quota system that reserved 30 per cent of government jobs for relatives of veterans who fought in Bangladesh's War of Independence in 1971.</p>

<p>The internet and mobile services were snapped following the countrywide violence.</p>

<p>On Monday last, the supreme court slashed the veterans' quota to just 5 per cent. Thus, 93 per cent of civil service jobs will be merit-based while the remaining 2 per cent reserved for members of ethnic minorities, transgender and physically challenged people.</p>

<p>The violence has reportedly killed more than 100 people, according to local newspapers. However, there are no official figures available for deaths.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on Tuesday defended her decision to enforce a curfew with a shoot-on-sight order following the clashes, asserting that tough measures were taken to ensure the security of the lives and properties of the people.</p>

<p>Bangladesh crawled back to normalcy on Wednesday with rush hour traffic returning to streets in the capital, and limited reopening of banks, garment factories and internet services.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Pakistan Peoples Party-led by Bilawal Bhutto Zardari has said that it is ready to talk with jailed former prime minister Imran Khan if the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf founder is willing to engage, amidst heightened political instability in the cash-strapped country.</p>

<p>"It is being said that the PTI founder is ready to talk. If Imran Khan is ready to talk then that's a positive thing," Senior PPP leader Khurshid Shah said while speaking to the media in Quetta, the provincial capital of Balochistan.</p>

<p>Mr Shah welcomed the possibility of talks as a positive development.</p>

<p>"President Asif Ali Zardari has always tried to solve problems through negotiations, and the PPP would play its role if needed," Mr Shah was quoted as saying by the Express Tribune newspaper.</p>

<p>The PPP's willingness to engage with Khan's party comes amidst heightened political instability, following the PTI's hard-line stance against the incumbent Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) led government.</p>

<p>The PPP, along with the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) and other allies, supports the PML-N of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. The two former rivals recently witnessed a war of words. The ruling PML-N accepted all the demands of PPP over the federal budget and allocation of development funds.</p>

<p>Since Mr Khan's ouster through a vote of no confidence in 2022, the PTI has maintained a strong opposition to the PPP-PML-N alliance.</p>

<p>Political tensions increased after the February 8 elections, which saw the two parties forming a coalition government in the Centre.</p>

<p>Calls for reconciliation have been growing from various societal and political quarters, urging the PTI to negotiate with the government.</p>

<p>Mr Khan's party had previously rejected talks with what it termed the "Form-47 government," instead showing a preference for dialogue with the military establishment.</p>

<p>In April, PTI's Shehryar Afridi indicated a preference for negotiations with Army chief Gen Asim Munir and the Director General of Inter-Services Intelligence (DG ISI).</p>

<p>Subsequently, PTI Secretary General Omar Ayub mentioned that Imran Khan had assigned significant responsibility to former President Dr Arif Alvi.</p>

<p>Last month, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar confirmed that Mr Khan had approved discussions with the government.</p>

<p>Similarly, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur and Khan's sister Aleema Khan called for state institutions to remain neutral for the country's progress.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the government too has called on the Khan-founded party to come to the table and hold talks.</p>

<p>"If you want to remove us then do it. You don't want to resolve issues but to further complicate them. You should do talks instead of destroying everything," Federal Minister for Petroleum Dr Musadik Malik said last week.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>France's national rail operator on Sunday said it had repaired damage caused by saboteurs that paralysed the train network hours before the Olympics opening ceremony, and normal services would resume on Monday.</p>

<p>Train traffic on the main line west out of Paris was already "practically normal" and "three out of four" high-speed TGV trains were running on the main line north from the capital, "without any increase in travel time from now on", operator SNCF said on Sunday.</p>

<p>It remains unclear who carried out the three attacks on strategic points of the rail infrastructure overnight on Thursday to Friday, or if they were deliberately timed to disrupt the Games' opening spectacle later on Friday.</p>

<p>Tens of thousands of rail passengers struggled through two days of cancelled and delayed trains on Friday and Saturday, when 800,000 travellers were due to leave for their summer holidays.</p>

<p>"Thanks to the exceptional efforts of SNCF Network staff, who worked non-stop since Friday morning, repairs are now fully completed on all the high-speed rail services affected by the sabotage attacks," the operator said.</p>

<p>"Tests have been conclusive and the train lines are now able to function as normal.</p>

<p>"There will be no more disruption from Monday morning onwards," it said.</p>

<p>No group has claimed responsibility for the meticulously planned night-time attacks. Maintenance workers thwarted a fourth.</p>

<h3><strong>Search for perpetrators</strong></h3>

<p>A source close to the Paris judicial authority, which has launched an investigation, said the attacks had all been carried out by "the same entity".</p>

<p>A statement signed by "an unexpected delegation" was sent to several news media outlets expressing support for the sabotage and criticising the Olympic Games as being a "celebration of nationalism" and the oppression of peoples by nation states.</p>

<p>But sources close to the investigation said it was simply a message of support, rather than a claim of responsibility per se, gave no details of the attacks and contained "nothing particularly serious".</p>

<p>"We have uncovered a certain number of elements that allow us to think that we will soon know who is responsible for what clearly did not sabotage the Olympic Games but did sabotage part of the holidays of the French people," Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin told France 2 television on Saturday.</p>

<p>French authorities are on high alert for a potential terrorist attack during the Games, which run until August 11.</p>

<p>Tens of thousands of police and soldiers have been placed on security duties during the Olympics.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei gave Sunday his official endorsement of Masoud Pezeshkian as the Islamic Republic's ninth president, following snap elections won by the reformist camp's candidate.</p>

<p>In a message read by the director of Khamenei's office, he said: "I endorse the vote (for) the wise, honest, popular and scholarly Mr Pezeshkian, and I am appointing him as the president of the Islamic Republic of Iran".</p>

<p>The new reformist president is due to be sworn in before parliament on Tuesday.</p>

<p>The endorsement ceremony was held in the capital Tehran in the presence of senior Iranian officials and foreign diplomats, and broadcast on state TV.</p>

<p>It took place as banks and most government offices were ordered shut nationwide on Sunday to tackle an extreme heatwave.</p>

<p>Following the event, acting president Mohammad Mokhber handed over official responsibilities to 69-year-old Pezeshkian.</p>

<p>Later Sunday, Pezeshkian appointed reformist Mohammad Reza Aref, 72, as his first vice president, according to an announcement carried by state TV.</p>

<p>Aref has represented Tehran in parliament and served as first vice president and communications minister under Iran's last reformist president Mohammad Khatami, who held office from 1997 to 2005.</p>

<p>Pezeshkian, a heart surgeon and parliament member for the northwestern city of Tabriz since 2008, was Khatami's health minister.</p>

<p>On July 5 the reformist candidate won a runoff race against the ultraconservative Saeed Jalili to replace President Ebrahim Raisi who died in a helicopter crash in May.</p>

<p>Pezeshkian secured more than 16 million votes or about 54 per cent of the roughly 30 million ballots cast.</p>

<p>Turnout in the runoff election stood at 49.8 per cent, up from a record low of about 40 per cent in the first round, according to Iran's electoral authority.</p>

<p>Jalili attended Sunday's ceremony, as did former moderate president Hassan Rouhani who had backed Pezeshkian's presidential bid along with Iran's main reformist coalition.</p>

<h3><strong>'Bad attitude'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Pezeshkian was the only candidate representing Iran's reformist camp allowed to stand in the election, for which all contenders were approved by the conservative-dominated Guardian Council.</p>

<p>Iran's president is not head of state, and the ultimate authority rests with the supreme leader -- a post held by Khamenei for the last 35 years.</p>

<p>Following Khamenei's official endorsement, Pezeshkian thanked the leader and the Iranian people, vowing to carry the "heavy burden" of the presidency.</p>

<p>The election came against a backdrop of heightened regional tensions since the Gaza war began in early October, disputes with Western powers over Iran's nuclear programme and domestic discontent over the state of the sanctions-hit economy.</p>

<p>During the ceremony, Khamenei urged the upcoming administration to form an "active and effective" response to regional developments, adding that diplomacy must prioritise neighbouring nations.</p>

<p>"We have no intention to oppose some European countries. The reason I didn't mention European countries as a priority is that they have not treated us well for many years," he added.</p>

<p>"If they don't have this bad attitude, then (ties with Europe) would be one of our priorities."</p>

<p>On the campaign trail, Pezeshkian had pledged to try to revive a 2015 nuclear deal with the United States and other world powers, which imposed curbs on Iran's nuclear activity in return for sanctions relief.</p>

<p>The deal collapsed in 2018 after Washington withdrew from it.</p>

<p>Pezeshkian has in a recent article called for "constructive relations" with European countries, even though he accused them of reneging on commitments to mitigate the impact of US sanctions.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Responding to the criticism of the Indian contingent's costume at Paris Olympics, fashion designer Tarun Tahiliani has said he stands by the design and slammed "armchair critics" for implying that he charged a fee for designing the athletes' attire.</p>

<p>Speaking exclusively to NDTV, Mr Tahiliani said his team followed guidelines of International Olympic Committee while designing the kits. "Many things changed in the last minute. I stand by our design. This is what we Indians wear, and this is not to be a couture show. I accept people can have their views. I am good with that, but I stand by what we did," he said.</p>

<p>"We wanted the team in the colours of the tricolour as most countries follow their flag and that was visible from afar," he said.</p>

<p>Many in social media have criticised the designer over the Indian athletes' outfits and described them as dull. "It would have been very easy for me to send them in zardozi vests. But it's not appropriate," the designer said in response to such criticism.</p>

<p>Some social media users have pointed out that the outfits have digital prints on them and India, with its rich heritage of handloom and embroidery, should have been represented on this world stage by better attire.</p>

<p>The designer said his team had just three weeks to ready the costumes. "I can't weave handloom for 300 uniforms in that time. The shoes were brocade, brocade from Benares" he said.</p>

<p>He also responded to the charge that the logo of Tasva, an Aditya Birla Group brand of which Mr Tahiliani is chief design officer, was used on the costumes. "A symbol was made into a border, that's all. When you see a photograph, you won't even notice it. We earlier put the Indian flag there, but were told one should not use it. We followed the guidelines," he said.</p>

<p>The designer strongly denied claims that Tasva charged for designing the costumes. "The cheek of these armchair critics. This was paid for by Tasva. It was not done for a fee, it was done to support our athletes. Asking what I was paid for it just shows their mentality," he said.</p>

<p>Tasva had earlier said in a statement that it was honoured to design the outfits for the Indian contingent in collaboration with Tarun Tahiliani. "This prestigious collaboration for Tasva, as the 'Official Ceremonial Dress Partner' for Team India at the Paris Olympics, marks a significant milestone in Tasva's journey as it represents the spirit, culture, and elegance of India on the global stage," it said.</p>

<p>It said the Indian athletes' ceremonial attire for the opening ceremony draws profound inspiration from the Indian flag. "The tricolor palette embodies national pride and unity. The contemporary silhouettes of the Bundi jacket and the pre-pleated saree when combined with the thoughtful choice of fabrics-cotton and viscose crepe-along with practical detail, not just ensures comfort and functionality for the athletes, but also represents a fine balance of tradition with modernity."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A landslide caused by flooding in central China's Hunan province destroyed a guesthouse and killed 12 people on Sunday, state media reported.</p>

<p>Official broadcaster CCTV said it had "been initially confirmed that 18 people were buried".</p>

<p>Twelve bodies and six injured survivors had been recovered by Sunday evening, the official Xinhua news agency said.</p>

<p>One person had been missing before the 12th body was found.</p>

<p>The landslide was caused by flash flooding on a mountain, which destroyed the guesthouse, according to CCTV.</p>

<p>More than 240 emergency personnel had been sent to the scene.</p>

<p>A video published by the state-run Beijing Youth Daily showed a swath of mud and debris cutting through a green hillside and an uprooted tree lying in front of a three-storey building.</p>

<p>An aerial video on Xinhua showed what appeared to be the ruined bottom half of a building at the top of the debris trail, as well as damaged buildings at the foot of the hill.</p>

<p>China has suffered a summer of extreme weather, with flash floods in the north and southwest killing at least 20 people this month.</p>

<p>A highway in southern China collapsed in May after days of rain, killing 48 people.</p>

<p>Scientists say climate change is making extreme weather more frequent and intense, and China is the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases.</p>

<p>Long dependent on polluting energy sources such as coal, Beijing has pledged to bring emissions of planet-heating carbon dioxide to a peak by 2030 and to net zero by 2060.</p>

<p>It is already the world's largest producer of renewable energy, with research this month showing China is building almost twice as much solar and wind power capacity as the rest of the world combined.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Russian President Vladimir Putin on Sunday threatened to relaunch production of intermediate-range nuclear weapons if the United States confirmed its intention to deploy missiles to Germany or elsewhere in Europe.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin on Sunday threatened to relaunch production of intermediate-range nuclear weapons if the United States confirmed its intention to deploy missiles to Germany or elsewhere in Europe.</p>

<p>"If the United States carries out such plans, we will consider ourselves liberated from the unilateral moratorium previously adopted on the deployment of medium- and short-range strike capabilities," Putin said during a naval parade in Saint Petersburg.</p>

<p>Putin added that now in Russia "the development of a number of such systems is in the final stages".</p>

<p>"We will take mirror measures in deploying them, taking into account the actions of the US, its satellites in Europe and in other regions of the world," the Russian president warned.</p>

<p>Such missiles, which can travel between 500 and 5,500 kilometres (300-3,400 miles), were the subject of an arms control treaty signed by the US and the Soviet Union in 1987.</p>

<p>But both Washington and Moscow withdrew from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty in 2019, each accusing the other of violations.</p>

<p>Russia subsequently said it would not restart production of such missiles as long as the United States did not deploy missiles abroad.</p>

<p>In early July, Washington and Berlin announced that the "episodic deployments" of long-range US missiles, including Tomahawk cruise missiles, to Germany would begin in 2026.</p>

<p>Putin said that "important Russian administrative and military sites" would fall within the range of such missiles that "could in the future be equipped with nuclear warheads, such that our territories would be within around 10 minutes" of a strike being launched.</p>

<p>The Russian president also mentioned that the US has deployed Typhon mid-range missile systems in Denmark and the Philippines in recent exercises.</p>

<h3><strong>'Cold War' reminder&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>"This situation reminds us of the events of the Cold War linked to the deployment of American Pershing medium-range missiles in Europe," said Putin.</p>

<p>The US deployed US Pershing ballistic missiles in West Germany in the 1980s at the height of the Cold War.</p>

<p>US missiles continued to be stationed through the reunification of Germany and into the 1990s.</p>

<p>But following the end of the Cold War, the United States significantly reduced the number of missiles stationed in Europe as the threat from Moscow receded.</p>

<p>The Kremlin had already warned in mid-July that the proposed US deployment would mean that European capitals would become a target for Russian missiles.</p>

<p>"We are taking steady steps towards the Cold War. All the attributes of the Cold War with the direct confrontation are returning," Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told a state TV reporter.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over 200 naval vessels, including ships from the Indian, Chinese, and Algerian navies, took part in the traditional maritime parade in St Petersburg to mark Russia's Navy Day on Sunday.</p>

<p>President Vladimir Putin, Defense Minister Andrey Belousov, and Commander-in-Chief of the Navy Admiral Aleksandr Moiseyev oversaw the parade, which takes place on the last Sunday of July, RT reported.</p>

<p>In his address on the occasion, President Putin vowed that Russia would continue to strengthen its naval forces and modernise its fleets with high-tech assets, including hypersonic missiles.</p>

<p>Over 15,000 service members and vessels of various classes drawn from Russia's Northern, Pacific, and Baltic fleets, the Caspian flotilla, as well as members of the naval force expedition in Syria, participated in the event. However, ships from the Black Sea Fleet were absent as they were engaged in active operations in the Ukraine conflict.</p>

<p>The parade is traditionally led by the Poltava, a reconstructed 18th-century 54-gun sailing ship. The original ship, launched in 1712, was named after the site of the battle where Russia won a crushing victory over Sweden in 1709, turning the tide of the Great Northern War and paving the way for Russia to become a major world power.</p>

<p>Another highlight of the parade was patrol icebreaker, 'Ivan Papanin', specifically designed for Arctic conditions. Russia currently possesses the largest icebreaker fleet in the world, numbering more than 40 vessels.</p>

<p>Other ships in the parade included several small-sized missile ships and corvettes, usually armed with Kalibr cruise missiles, which have a range of more than 1,000km.</p>

<p>The submarine force was represented by the diesel-electric submarine 'Mozhaisk', which can be armed with torpedoes or Kalibr missiles.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Chinese Navy's destroyer 'Jiaozuo' and replenishment ship 'Honghu', the Algerian Navy training ship 'La Soummam', and the Indian Navy's Russia-made Talwar-class stealth frigate 'Tabar', also took part.</p>

<p>The naval parade was followed by a parade on land, which included cadets from several Russian naval institutions, as well as a detachment of marines.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The 2024 Paris Olympics have officially begun, bringing together the world's finest athletes vying for the ultimate prize. This year's Olympic medals hold a secret that will make them truly unforgettable - a piece of Paris itself. Embedded within each medal is a fragment of the iconic Eiffel Tower.</p>

<p>Winners across the 329 events, taking place until mid-August, will receive these unique medals, each containing 18 grams of ironwork from the Eiffel Tower, salvaged during its 20th-century renovations and maintenance. The medals' design, inspired by the iconic monument, features a lattice pattern on the blue ribbons, which echo the Eiffel Tower's ribbing.</p>

<p>Crafted by luxury jewellers Chaumet and produced by the Monnaie de Paris, the medals reflect Paris' famous nickname, 'The City of Lights'. The gold medals weigh 529 grams, silver medals 525 grams and bronze medals 455 grams. A similar design will be used for the Paralympic medals, featuring red ribbons.</p>

<p>Earlier in February, the official X handle of the Olympic Games revealed, "When the structure underwent renovation work in the 20th century, certain metallic elements were removed and carefully preserved. Now, the Societe d'Exploitation de la Tour Eiffel has given these rare pieces of history a second lease of life ahead of #Paris2024.</p>

<p>The Paralympic medals display an underneath view of the Eiffel Tower and are inscribed with "Paris 2024" in Braille, paying tribute to the French inventor of the writing system.</p>

<p>"What's impactful for this year will be having a part of the original Eiffel Tower metal, the iron, in these various medals, and so this is what we wanted to do, to infuse all these 2024 athletes with that metal," Tony Estanguet, President of the Paris 2024 Organising Committee, said, as per Forbes.</p>

<p>Around 5,084 medals have been made for the Paris Olympics, with approximately 2,600 for the Olympics and 2,400 for the Paralympics.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Paris 2024 organisers apologised on Sunday to Catholics and other Christian groups angered by a kitsch tableau in the Olympic Games opening ceremony that parodied Leonardo Da Vinci's famous 'The Last Supper' painting.</p>

<p>The segment, which resembled the biblical scene of Jesus Christ and his apostles sharing a last meal before crucifixion and featured drag queens, a transgender model and a naked singer made up as the Greek god of wine Dionysus, drew dismay from the Catholic Church and the religious right in America.</p>

<p>"Clearly there was never an intention to show disrespect to any religious group. (The opening ceremony) tried to celebrate community tolerance," Paris 2024 spokesperson Anne Descamps told a press conference.</p>

<p>"We believe this ambition was achieved. If people have taken any offence we are really sorry."</p>

<p>France, while proud of its rich Catholic heritage, also has a long tradition of secularism and anti-clericalism. Blasphemy is not only legal, but also considered by many as an essential pillar of freedom of speech.</p>

<p>Supporters of the tableau praised its message of inclusivity and tolerance.</p>

<p>The Catholic church in France said it deplored a ceremony that "included scenes of derision and mockery of Christianity."</p>

<p>In Germany, the Bishop of Passau, Stefan Oster, said: "An impressive opening to hopefully peaceful games. The queer Last Supper was a low point, however, and wholly superfluous in the context."</p>

<p>Some commentators said the controversy was another example of 21st century culture wars turbocharged by a 24-hour news cycle and social media.</p>

<p>Thomas Jolly, the artistic director and mastermind behind the flamboyant opening ceremony, said religious subversion had never been his intention.</p>

<p>"We wanted to talk about diversity. Diversity means being together. We wanted to include everyone, as simple as that," he told reporters on Saturday.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Sunday that there was "every indication" that Lebanese fighter group Hezbollah was behind a rocket strike in the Israel-annexed Golan Heights that killed 12 young people.</p>

<p>"Every indication is that indeed the rocket was from Hezbollah. We stand by Israel's right to defend its citizens from terrorist attacks," Blinken told reporters in Japan.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said the young people were struck on Saturday by an Iranian-made rocket carrying a 50-kilogram warhead that Iran-backed Hezbollah fired at a football field in the Druze Arab town of Majdal Shams.</p>

<p>Hezbollah has denied responsibility for the strike.</p>

<p>"We are determined to bring the Gaza conflict to a close. It's gone on for far too long. It's cost far too many lives. We want to see Israelis, we want to see Palestinians, we want to see Lebanese live free from the threat of conflict and violence," Blinken said.</p>

<p>"We're in conversations with the government of Israel. And again, I emphasise its right to defend its citizens and our determination to make sure that they're able to do that," he said in Tokyo.</p>

<p>"But we also don't want to see the conflict escalating. We don't want to see a spread. That has been one of our goals from day one, from October 7 on, and we'll continue to do that.</p>

<p>"But again, the best way to do that in a sustained way is to get the ceasefire in Gaza that we're working so hard on virtually every minute of the day," he said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

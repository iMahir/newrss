       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>North Korean state media on Wednesday said around 1.4 million young people including students and youth league officials joined or returned to the army this week.</p>

<p>The young people are determined to fight in a "sacred war of destroying the enemy with the arms of the revolution," the KCNA report said.</p>

<p>North Korea's claim of having over one million young people enlisting in the country's Korean People's Army in just two days comes at a time when tensions in the Korean peninsula are running high.</p>

<p>Last year, North Korean media made a similar claim of its citizens volunteering to join the military to fight against the United States.</p>

<p>North Korea blew up sections of inter-Korean roads and rail lines on its side of the heavily fortified border between the two Koreas on Tuesday, prompting South Korea's military to fire warning shots.</p>

<p>Pyongyang has also accused Seoul of sending drones over the North Korean capital and the two Koreas have clashed over balloons of trash floated since May from North Korea. Pyongyang has said the launches are a response to balloons sent by anti-regime activists in the South.</p>

<p>"If a war breaks out, the ROK will be wiped off the map. As it wants a war, we are willing to put an end to its existence," the KCNA report said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Facebook parent company Meta must face lawsuits by U.S. states accusing it of encouraging social media addiction among teens, a federal judge in California ruled on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Oakland-based U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers rejected Meta's bid to toss the claims made by the states in two separate lawsuits filed last year, one including more than 30 states and the other including only Florida.</p>

<p>The company had argued that federal law blocked some of the claims and that the states failed to point to misleading statements that it had made.</p>

<p>The judge put some limits on the claims that the states - numbering more than 30 in all - could pursue, but allowed the case to go forward largely intact. The judge also rejected the social media company's motion to dismiss some claims over social media addiction brought by individual plaintiffs.</p>

<p>The states are asking the court for injunctions against Meta's allegedly illegal business practices and are seeking unspecified monetary damages.</p>

<p>Meta did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>

<p>Hundreds of lawsuits have been filed by various plaintiffs against Meta, ByteDance's TikTok and Alphabet's YouTube, accusing the companies of designing addictive algorithms that led to anxiety, depression and body-image issues among adolescents, and failing to warn of their risks.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>World Bank President Ajay Banga on Tuesday said former President Donald Trump understands the value of international financial institutions and how their lending can lead to expanded markets for American companies overseas.</p>

<p>Asked about potential consequences for the World Bank if Trump - a critic of multilateral institutions and efforts to combat climate change - wins the Nov. 5 presidential election, Banga struck a sanguine tone.</p>

<p>"President Trump was the one who actually authorized a capital increase in the IBRD (International Bank for Reconstruction and Development) when he was in the office," Mr Banga said. "At the end of the day, he understands the value, if you can put it in the terms that make sense for what he's trying to get done, for his administration's policies."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kamala Harris questioned Donald Trump's state of mind today after the 78-year-old Republican's latest televised town hall metamorphosed into a bizarre, unexpected music session.</p>

<p>"Hope he's okay," she posted on X.</p>

<p>With only three weeks to go, Harris' campaign has begun to attack Trump's health, age and state of mind.</p>

<p>However, Trump's campaign spokesman Steven Cheung said that instead "something very special" had taken place during the event.</p>

<p>The session was moderated by a right-wing ally, South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem, in Oaks, Pennsylvania, wherein Trump even got the election date wrong by two months, urging supporters to vote "on January 5."</p>

<p>When the town hall was paused for two audience members who required medical attention, Trump jokingly asked whether "anybody else would like to faint," and later declared, "Let's not do any more questions."</p>

<p>"Let's just listen to music. Let's make it into a music. Who the hell wants to hear questions, right?" he said.</p>

<p>For more than half an hour, the Trump playlist blasted while the candidate stood on stage for nine hours, listening as his dance steps gradually shifted from jerky to a sway.</p>

<h2><strong>HARRIS QUESTIONS TRUMP'S STATE OF MIND</strong></h2>

<p>"Trump appears lost, confused, and frozen on stage as multiple songs play for 30+ minutes and the crowd pours out of the venue early", Ms Harris's campaign posted on X - immediately swooping down to strike on the town hall episode.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Reacting to Harris' post, one X used wrote, "He needs to release his medical records now. This is bad."</p>

<p>While one of Trump's supporters commented, "As someone who was there the entire time, this is a bald-faced lie. It was Trump's idea to play the music-and he even selected several of the songs."</p>

<h3><strong>TRUMP'S CLAPBACK</strong></h3>

<p>Attacking Harris in multiple posts published on his own Truth Social platform after the Pennsylvania town hall, he declared he was "far healthier" than "Clinton, Bush, Obama, Biden, but especially, Kamala."</p>

<p>"Kamala's Medical Report is really bad. With all of the problems that she has, there is a real question as to whether or not she should be running for President! MY REPORT IS PERFECT - NO PROBLEMS!!!," Trump posted on his platform.</p>

<p>He called Harris "desperate" for saying he should provide reports to the American people and said "she is dying to see my Cholesterol (which is 180!)."</p>

<p>Trump, the oldest person to be nominated for a presidential bid, after Joe Biden dropped off from the race, has not released a recent comprehensive report on his state of health, leading Harris to fiercely criticise it. The latter however, turns 60 this Sunday and released a medical report in which the White House doctor declared her "in excellent health," with the "physical and mental resiliency" to serve as president.<br />

<p>"First of all, I think this unbelievable loss of life - women, children, others, civilians, is just unconscionable on all sides," Mr Banga said.

       <description><![CDATA[Justin Trudeau's attempts for personal electoral gains have reached a level where actual diplomatic relations are seeing a fallout over "the politics of vote-bank". Is his government's attempts to retain power proving to be the downfall of Canada?]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is not uncommon to see a country's election campaigns politicise various global issues, but what is rather unusual and perhaps unique in the case of Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau, is "how far he can go" for personal electoral gains. His attempts have reached a level where actual diplomatic relations are seeing a fallout over "the politics of vote-bank".</p>

<p>India and Canada are in the midst of the worst-ever diplomatic spat in the history of bilateral ties between the two nations. India has recalled its high commissioner to Canada and expelled six top diplomats from Canada yesterday. Canada mirrored India's move. The reason - Justin Trudeau's proximity to the Khalistan separatist movement and his sympathy towards declared terrorists and extremists who spread hate, violence, and extremism on Canadian soil - all to appeal to his vote bank.</p>

<p>Mr Trudeau, who is seeking another term as Canada's prime minister, but facing one setback after another politically in his country, has repeatedly supported the Khalistani separatist movement and allowed space for them to operate by calling it "freedom of speech" in his country.</p>

<p>The <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/glorification-of-violence-india-slams-canada-over-khalistani-floats-5611239" target="_blank">Prime Minister of Canada has stood shoulder-to-shoulder with terrorists</a>, extremists and separatists by attending Khalistan rallies in Canada. By doing so, Canada's Prime Minister has directly violated India's national security concerns whilst also violating India's sovereignty and territorial integrity by supporting those who want another nation to be carved out of India - terming all this as "free speech in Canada."</p>

<p>"Celebration and glorification of violence should not be a part of any civilized society. Democratic countries which respect the rule of law should not allow intimidation by radical elements in the name of freedom of expression," India had said about Trudeau's attendance at the Khalistan rally.</p>

<p>Citing his concern over grave situation and rapidly deteriorating ties, while also seeing a rise in extremist elements in Canada, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar had said earlier this year that "By allowing political space to Khalistani separatist elements, the Canadian government (led by Justin Trudeau) is repeatedly showing that its <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/canada-showing-its-vote-bank-is-more-powerful-than-its-rule-of-law-s-jaishankar-5631952" target="_blank">vote bank is more powerful</a> than its rule of law."</p>

<p>Speaking to Press Trust of India, Mr Jaishankar had said, "India respects and practices freedom of speech, but that does not equate with freedom to threaten foreign diplomats, extend support to separatism or allow political space to elements advocating violence and terror."</p>

<p>Mr Jaishankar had also wondered how people with "dubious backgrounds are being allowed to enter and live in Canada", referring to select Khalistani separatists among the Sikh migrants from Punjab.</p>

<p>"In any rules-based society, you would imagine that you would check people's background, how they came, what passport they carried etc," he said, adding that "If you have people whose presence there is itself on very dubious documents, what does it say about you? It actually says that your vote bank is more powerful than your rule of law."</p>

<p><strong>TRUDEAU'S LATEST ATTEMPT</strong></p>

<p>India and Canada have been dealing with an unprecedented diplomatic crisis after Justin Trudeau alleged that Indian government agents were involved in the killing of Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar in Canada. India has rejected Canada's allegations, terming it "absurd" and "politically motivated."</p>

<p>Losing electoral ground fast in the last few months since key ally, Jagmeet Singh withdrew support to his party, Justin Trudeau has likely pacified his "vote bank" late on Monday as he doubled down on accusations of India "supporting criminal activity against Canadians" and "coercive behaviour targeting South Asian Canadians".</p>

<p>In his latest allegations, Mr Trudeau called the Indian High Commissioner a "person of interest" in the "murder" investigation of Khalistani terrorist Nijjar. India trashed Mr Trudeau's allegations, describing them as "<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/reject-preposterous-imputations-india-strongly-hits-back-at-canada-6785660" target="_blank">preposterous imputations</a>."</p>

<p>On its part, India - which has yet to respond to these latest comments - has set up a high-level committee to investigate the allegation.</p>

<p>However, calling out "the political agenda of Justin Trudeau's government" in a strongly worded rebuttal, India issued a statement saying, "The Government of India strongly rejects these preposterous imputations and ascribes them to the political agenda of the Trudeau Government that is centered around vote bank politics."</p>

<p>"Since Prime Minister Trudeau made certain allegations in September 2023, the Canadian government has not shared a shred of evidence with the Government of India, despite many requests from our side. This latest step follows interactions that have again witnessed assertions without any facts. This leaves little doubt that on the pretext of an investigation, there is a deliberate strategy of smearing India for political gains," India's statement read.</p>

<p>"Prime Minister Trudeau's hostility to India has long been in evidence. In 2018, his visit to India, which was aimed at currying favour with a vote bank, rebounded to his discomfort. His Cabinet has included individuals who have openly associated with an extremist and separatist agenda regarding India. His naked interference in Indian internal politics in December 2020 showed how far he was willing to go in this regard. That his government was dependent on a political party, whose leader openly espouses a separatist ideology vis-a-vis India, only aggravated matters," Centre's statement further read.</p>

<p><strong>TRUDEAU'S POLITICAL SETBACKS AHEAD OF CANADA ELECTIONS</strong></p>

<p>In the last few months, Justin Trudeau has faced a series of political setbacks. What has been alarming for him is that he has lost the support of his key ally, Jagmeet Singh's party. Singh openly professes for 'Khalistan'.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/bruised-by-fresh-election-loss-justin-trudeau-shows-no-sign-of-stepping-down-6592944" target="_blank">Doubts about the leadership</a> of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau intensified after his ruling Liberal Party suffered two humiliating losses in a special election, but despite that, the unpopular leader is determined to cling to office ahead of a looming national vote.</p>

<p>The loss, following a defeat in Toronto in late June, reinforced the perception that Liberal prospects in the next national election are dim. The mandate for Trudeau's minority government expires at the end of October 2025, but an early election has become increasingly likely.</p>

<p>Although polls indicate the Liberals will lose badly to the official opposition right-of-center Conservatives in the next election amid unhappiness over inflation, healthcare and a housing crisis, Trudeau and his closest aides say he is going nowhere and has time to help the party recover.</p>

<p>According to a survey by global market research and public opinion firm IPSOS, only 26 per cent people see Justin Trudeau as a good PM - he found himself to be 19 per cent less than Pierre Poilievre, leader of the Conservative Party.</p>

<p>Facing being ousted from the post of Prime Minister, Mr Trudeau has made a series of allegations against India to polarise the electorate whilst catering to his vote bank in a desperate attempt to get all the support he can for him to remain prime minister.</p>

<p><strong>THE INDIAN DIASPORA</strong></p>

<p>The Indian diaspora in Canada is about 1.8 million strong and there are another one million Non Resident Indians residing in the country. The Indian diaspora, mostly of Sikh ethnicity, is considered an influential bloc in Canada's politics.</p>

<p>Ties between India and Canada came under severe strain following Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's allegations in September last year of the "potential" involvement of Indian agents in the killing of Nijjar.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Tuesday he told French President Emmanuel Macron that he would not agree to a ceasefire deal that failed to stop Hezbollah rearming and regrouping.</p>

<p>Macron has called for a ceasefire between Israel and Iran-backed Hezbollah as well as an end to arms exports used in the Gaza Strip and Lebanon.</p>

<p>"The Prime Minister told President Macron that he opposes a unilateral ceasefire, which would not change the security situation in Lebanon and would return the country to its previous state," a statement from his office said.</p>

<p>"He emphasized that Israel is operating against the Hezbollah terrorist organization to prevent it from threatening Israel's citizens on the northern border and to enable them to return to their homes safely."</p>

<p>On Monday, France rejected demands made by Netanyahu for a U.N. peacekeeping mission, known as UNIFIL, to pull back from its position in Lebanon, while France has summoned Israel's ambassador over an incident where Israeli troops opened fire at three positions held by U.N. peace keepers in southern Lebanon.</p>

<p>Netanyahu, it said, was taken aback at President Macron's intention to host a conference in Paris on the issue of Lebanon, with participants such as South Africa and Algeria, "which are working to deny Israel its fundamental right of self-defense and, in effect, reject its very right to exist".</p>

<p>In a message to Macron, Netanyahu's office also said in a separate statement that the State of Israel was established through "the War of Independence with the blood of our heroic fighters, many of whom were Holocaust survivors, including from the Vichy regime in France." It added that in recent decades, the UN has approved hundreds of antisemitic resolutions against Israel.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United States warned Israel on the possibility of withholding some assistance barring improvements in aid delivery to Palestinians in Gaza, the State Department said Tuesday.</p>

<p>In a letter sent Sunday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin made "clear to the government of Israel that there are changes that they need to make again to see that the level of assistance making it into Gaza comes back up from the very, very low levels that it is at today," State Department spokesman Matthew Miller told reporters.</p>

<p>The letter pointed to US law that requires that "recipients of US military assistance do not arbitrarily deny or impede the provisioning of US humanitarian assistance."</p>

<p>"Our hope is that Israel will make changes that we have outlined and that we have recommended, and as a result of those changes will be a dramatic increase in humanitarian assistance."</p>

<p>The letter, weeks before a US election, comes a year into the Israel-Hamas war in which President Joe Biden has repeatedly voiced concern about the lack of assistance and high civilian casualties but only once is known to have blocked a shipment in the billions of dollars of US aid to Israel.</p>

<p>Miller denied any link to the US election. The letter called for action within 30 days, which would fall after voting ends.</p>

<p>"We didn't think it was appropriate to send a letter and just say this has to happen overnight," Miller said.</p>

<p>He pointed to Israel sending assistance through the Erez crossing into Gaza on Monday, a day after Blinken sent the letter.</p>

<p>"We very much want to see changes not wait for 30 days but happen immediately," he said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[India exercised its right of reply against Pakistan at the Joint General Debate on decolonization at the United Nations on Monday.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>India exercised its right of reply against Pakistan at the Joint General Debate on decolonization at the United Nations on Monday. Counsellor Eldos Mathew Punnoose from India condemned Pakistan's "unsubstantiated allegations" regarding the Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh.</p>

<p>He emphasised the need for Pakistan to cease its ongoing human rights violations in Pakistan-occupied Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh.</p>

<p>Targeting Pakistan, he said, "Unsubstantiated allegations by Pakistan largely pertain to the Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh. India would like to reiterate that Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh are, were and will be an integral and inalienable part of India. Clearly, Pakistan does not merit a response on the internal affairs of India."</p>

<p>He further said, "At this juncture, we also advise Pakistan to stop the grave and ongoing human rights violations in Pakistan-occupied Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh (PoJKL). The world is witness to the divisive activities that Pakistan tries to undertake day in and day out. India would like to stress that our foundations are built on the enduring pillar of democratic values, unlike Pakistan's."</p>

<p>Stepping up his criticism of Pakistan, he said that the nation is familiar with sham elections, incarceration of opposition leaders, and suppression of political voices.</p>

<p>"Given their tainted democratic record, Pakistan considers real democratic exercises as a sham, as reflected in their statement. All countries speak from their experience. Sham elections, incarceration of opposition leaders and suppression of political voices are what Pakistan is familiar with," Punnoos said.</p>

<p>"It is natural that Pakistan must be disappointed to see real democracy at work. It was only last week that election results were announced in Jammu and Kashmir. Millions of voters in the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir have spoken. They exercised their right to vote and have chosen their leadership according to the Constitutional framework and universal adult suffrage. Clearly, these terms must be alien to Pakistan," he added.</p>

<p>He further criticised Pakistan by highlighting the country's notorious reputation for supporting terrorism and engaging in transnational crimes. "It is ironic that a country which is infamous across the globe for state-sponsored terrorism and transnational crimes cast aspersions on the world's largest democracy. It has been Pakistan's consistent state policy to employ cross-border terrorism as a weapon against its neighbours," Punnoos added.</p>

<p>He also said that Pakistan has been implicated in several attacks, including the attack on the Indian Parliament. "The list of attacks orchestrated by Pakistan is indeed long. In India, they have targeted our Parliament, market places and pilgrimage routes, among several others. Normal Indian citizens have been victims of such dastardly and inhumane acts by Pakistan," Punnoos said.</p>

<p>He also compared India and Pakistan, praising the former for its "pluralism, diversity and democracy," and highlighting the latter's "terrorism, parochialism and persecution."</p>

<p>Punnoos said, "India symbolises pluralism, diversity and democracy. In contrast, Pakistan reminds the world of terrorism, parochialism and persecution. Religious and ethnic minorities and their places of worship are targeted and vandalised on a regular basis. It is important for Pakistan to first look inward and set own house in order instead of meddling in the internal affairs of neighbouring countries."</p>

<p>He added, "Pakistan's obsession with India and their past practice corroborate that they will continue to use this august forum for spreading their malicious propaganda against my country. They will exercise their right of reply but I shall refrain from responding to it... As such, facts speak for themselves. Lies are lies, even if they are repeated over and over by Pakistan."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Punnoose emphasised India's pivotal role in the global struggle against colonialism, highlighting the country's unwavering commitment to freedom.</p>

<p>He said, "India has been a global champion and leading voice in the struggle against colonialism. In 1962, India was also elected as the first chair of the Decolonisation Committee, a committee of 24, which was established to monitor the implementation of the 1960 Declaration on Granting of Independence to colonial countries and peoples and consider applications in this regard. Since the establishment of the Decolonisation Committee, India has been actively contributing towards its functioning. We have also been working constructively on the decolonisation agenda..."</p>

<p>Notably, Pakistan regularly brings up the Jammu and Kashmir issue at UN platforms and other international forums, irrespective of the agenda of the meetings.</p>

<p>India has repeatedly rejected Pakistan's attempts to raise the Kashmir issue on international platforms, asserting that the union territories of Jammu and Kashmir as well as Ladakh are "integral parts of India" and Pakistan has no "locus standi" to make statements regarding India's domestic matters.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The agency is extending the prohibition against flying below certain altitudes through October 2027 citing risks from Iranian-aligned militia groups' activities and third-party military operations. The restrictions also apply to foreign operators operating as code share flights for US carriers. Last month, the US Transportation Department fined Air Canada $250,000 for operating flights in 2022 and 2023 in prohibited Iraqi airspace.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[S Jaishankar, who is in Pakistan for the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation or SCO Summit being hosted by Islamabad, had a brief interaction with Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif today at an official dinner held for all the summit attendees.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>S Jaishankar, who is in Pakistan for the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation or SCO Summit being hosted by Islamabad, had a brief interaction with Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif today at an official dinner held for all the summit attendees.</p>

<p>The two leaders shook hands and exchanged a courtesy greeting as Mr Sharif welcomed Mr Jaishankar for the official dinner for SCO leaders. Few worlds were spoken during the interaction that lasted less than twenty seconds.</p>

<p>Ties between India and Pakistan have nearly been non-existent in the last decade since Pak-based terrorists targeted Indian military establishments in a series of terror attacks in 2015 and 2016. India, which has for long aimed for peace and stability in the region, has made it amply clear to Pakistan that "terror and talks cannot go hand-in-hand", and that "dialogue and diplomacy can only move forward in an environment free of terrorism."</p>

<h2><strong>NEARLY A DECADE OF NO DIALOGUE</strong></h2>

<p>Mr Jaishankar's visit to Pakistan is the first by an Indian minister in nearly ten years. The last visit by an Indian foreign minister was when Mr Jaishankar's predecessor, Sushma Swaraj, had visited Islamabad for a conference on Afghanistan. Mr Jaishankar, who was then the foreign secretary had accompanied the then minister on her official visit.</p>

<p>Sushma Swaraj's visit was followed in quick succession by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who pushed for peace in the region by taking the initiative and giving a surprise visit to then Pakistani prime minister Nawaz Sharif at his ancestral home. But despite sincere efforts by India, talks were yet again derailed by a series of terror attacks on Indian soil by terrorists harboured and sheltered in Pakistan.</p>

<p>Before he reached Islamabad, Mr Jaishankar said at a press conference in New Delhi that his visit to the neighbouring country was only for the SCO summit and that no bilateral talks with Islamabad will be taking place.</p>

<p>Mr Jaishankar had said, "Like with any neighbour, India would certainly like to have good relations with Pakistan, but that cannot happen by overlooking cross-border terrorism and indulging in wishful thinking." The decision to send the senior minister to Pakistan, which is the host nation for the SCO Summit this time, is seen purely as a display of India's commitment to the forum.</p>

<p>Pakistan is hosting the two-day SCO Council of Heads of Government (CHG) summit on October 15 and 16. "The SCO CHG meeting is held annually and focuses on the trade and economic agenda of the Organisation," the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) had said.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[Mr Matlock soon went into cardiac arrest and suffered lung failure, which led to brain damage.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Colorado man fell seriously ill while on a cruise with his wife to celebrate their wedding anniversary after contracting a super virus. Guy Matlock, 64, was on a 14-day cruise in northern Europe with his wife, Adrien, marking their 37th wedding anniversary and their first time travelling outside the United States. Unfortunately, on the sixth day of the trip, Mr Matlock began showing flu-like symptoms that quickly escalated into more severe illnesses, according to his daughter, Moriah, who spoke to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://kfor.com/news/family-desperately-trying-to-get-colorado-dad-home-after-he-fell-ill-on-european-cruise/" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>KDVR</em></a>.</p>

<p>"They pulled into port as soon as possible... He was diagnosed with flu A, pneumonia, and sepsis, which essentially turned into a super virus that started attacking his major organs," Moriah said.</p>

<p>Mr Matlock soon went into cardiac arrest and suffered lung failure, which led to brain damage. He is currently receiving treatment at a hospital in Copenhagen, where he remains partially conscious and reliant on a ventilator to breathe. Though he is stable enough to be flown back to the US, he is not yet fully conscious, Moriah added.</p>

<p>The family is now raising funds for a costly medical evacuation to bring him back home. The cost of such a medical evacuation can be as high as $150,000. Meanwhile, Adrien has stayed in Copenhagen to be by her husband's side, while their children, who had flown to Denmark on emergency passports, have since returned to Colorado.</p>

<p>"It's very isolating to be in a foreign country where you don't know the language and there are so many cultural differences," Moriah told KDVR.</p>

<p>"His brain isn't getting enough stimulation because he hears the different languages and isn't able to process them."</p>

<p>Describing the emotional toll, Moriah told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.wjtv.com/news/family-desperately-trying-to-get-colorado-dad-home-after-he-fell-ill-on-european-cruise/" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>WJTV</em></a>, "No one can express the sorrow of seeing someone so strong in such a weakened state. A person who has always been your rock is now unable to even breathe on his own."</p>

<p>The family has set up a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/bring-guy-and-adrian-matlock-home-safely"><em>GoFundMe </em></a>page, which had raised just over $47,840 by Tuesday.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[S Jaishankar today landed in Islamabad to attend a conclave of the SCO, in the first visit to Pakistan by an Indian minister in nearly a decade.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar today landed in Islamabad to attend a conclave of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), in the first visit to Pakistan by an Indian minister in nearly a decade.</p>

<p>Ilyas Mehmood Nizami, the Director General for South Asia at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, warmly received Mr Jaishankar at Nur Khan Airbase in Islamabad, a foreign statement said.</p>

<p>Children dressed in traditional attire presented bouquets to the foreign dignitaries. A red carpet was rolled out to welcome the guests, underscoring the importance of the event, it added.</p>

<p>It is the first time in nearly nine years that India's foreign minister has travelled to Pakistan. Ties between the two neighbours have remained frosty over the issue of cross-border terrorism emanating from Pakistan. India has, on multiple occasions, clearly stated that "talks and terror cannot go hand-in-hand", and Pakistan must "stop using terrorism as an instrument of state policy by harbouring and shielding terrorists."</p>

<p>The last Indian Foreign Minister to visit Pakistan was Sushma Swaraj. She had travelled to Islamabad in December 2015 to attend a conference on Afghanistan.</p>

<p>"External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar will represent India at the meeting. India remains actively engaged in the SCO format, including various mechanisms and initiatives within the SCO framework," the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said in a brief statement in New Delhi.</p>

<h2><strong>'NO INDIA-PAK TALKS'</strong></h2>

<p>In his recent address at an event, Jaishankar said "like with any neighbour, India would certainly like to have good relations with Pakistan."</p>

<p>"But that cannot happen by overlooking cross-border terrorism and indulging in wishful thinking."</p>

<p>The decision to send the senior minister to Pakistan, which is the host nation for the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation Summit this time, is seen as a display of India's commitment to the SCO.</p>

<p>The foreign minister had earlier clearly stated that his visit to Islamabad was not to discuss "India-Pakistan relations", but instead, it is about the multilateral event - SCO Summit 2024. Speaking further about his visit, Mr Jaishankar had emphasised that he is travelling to Pakistan "only to be a good member of the SCO."</p>

<h3><strong>SECURITY ARRANGEMENTS</strong></h3>

<p>To ensure the safety and security of the 23rd SCO summit in Islamabad, the Pakistan Army has deployed to safeguard the event, key government buildings and the Red Zone area where state guests are staying.</p>

<p>The delegates will stay at different venues in Islamabad located within the 'Red Zone' or in its vicinity, as 14 locations in the capital have been arranged for their accommodation, Pakistani news website Dawn reported.</p>

<h3><b>SCO MEETING IN PAKISTAN</b></h3>

<p>According to the programme released by a spokesperson of Pakistan's Foreign Ministry, the dinner hosted by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif remains the only official engagement for the visiting leaders and delegations today.</p>

<p>The second day of the meeting will begin with Mr Sharif receiving leaders at Islamabad's Jinnah Convention Centre. The proceedings will begin following a group photograph and Prime Minister Sharif's opening remarks at the conference.</p>

<p>The signing of various documents will take place before Pakistan's Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar and SCO Secretary General Zhang Ming make their media statements. It will be followed by an official luncheon hosted by the country's PM.</p>

<p>The other SCO member states are represented by the Prime Ministers of China, Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan as well as the First Vice President of Iran. Prime Minister of Mongolia (Observer State) and Deputy Chairman of the Cabinet of Ministers and Foreign Minister of Turkmenistan (Special Guest) will also participate in the meeting.</p>

<p>Mr Jaishankar is expected to be in Islamabad for only about 24 hours and no India-Pakistan bilateral engagement is scheduled or expected on the sidelines of the summit.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A family of a 14-year-old student has claimed in a lawsuit that a California school teacher named Michelle Christine Solis, 46, groomed and sexually assaulted their son on his graduation day at Sycamore Middle School. The sexual assault has left the boy traumatised, the family alleges.</p>

<p>According to the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.sacbee.com/news/local/crime/article293790999.html" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>Sacramento Bee</em></a>, new allegations in the lawsuit say that Solis often organised meet-ups with the student. That's not all, she also gave him a pass for recess and spent alone time with him by saying she was helping him with homework.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On his eighth-grade graduation day, Solis took the boy into a classroom, locked the door, and coerced him into sex. According to the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.buttecounty.net/DocumentCenter/View/13732/July-18-2024---FORMER-GRIDLEY-TEACHER-SENTENCED-TO-PRISON-FOR-SEX-WITH-STUDENT"><em>Butte County District Attorney's Office</em></a>, the student then sent him photos of their encounter and asked the boy to delete their chats.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Rumours and copies of one of the nude photographs began to circulate in the Gridley community in October 2023. A Gridley Police investigation ensued and investigators contacted the boy and reviewed the contents of his phone, according to a press release by The Butte County District Attorney's Office. There they found communication between Solis and the boy, including two explicit photographs of Solis that matched the descriptions the boy previously provided.</p>

<p>The lawsuit further claims that the school failed to properly monitor their teacher's behaviour nor did they train other teachers to properly detect the grooming behaviour, the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/10/15/us-news/california-teacher-michelle-christine-solis-groomed-student-under-guise-of-tutoring-suit/"><em>New York Post</em></a> reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The suit is seeking "general damages and other non-economic relief" for physical, mental and emotional injuries sustained by the student.</p>

<p>Mark Boskovich, an attorney for the boy, told the local outlet that sexual abuse has traumatised the boy and had a lasting effect on him.</p>

<p>"He is back in the classroom where he had no control of the situation and felt helpless," Mr Boskovich told the Bee.</p>

<p>Solis, who has been a teacher for 20 years was sentenced to four years in prison back in July 2024. She is serving her sentence at the Central California Women's Facility in Chowchilla.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hezbollah deputy chief Naim Qassem warned Israelis on Tuesday that the only solution to the current war was a ceasefire that would pave the way for north Israel residents to return, vowing his group would not be defeated.</p>

<p>"I am telling the Israeli home front: the solution is a ceasefire," Qassem said in his third address since an Israeli strike killed former leader Hassan Nasrallah.</p>

<p>"I am not speaking from a position of weakness, because if Israel does not want (a ceasefire), we will continue," he added.</p>

<p>"The resistance (Hezbollah) will not be defeated because this is its land," he said.</p>

<p>"After a ceasefire via indirect agreement", residents of northern Israel will "return to the north and the other steps will be drawn up", Qassem said.</p>

<p>"Since the Israeli enemy targeted all of Lebanon, we have the right from a defensive position to target any place" in Israel, "whether the centre, the north or the south", he said. "We will choose the point that we see appropriate".</p>

<p>Almost a year of cross-border exchanges of fire between Israel and Hezbollah escalated into all-out war on September 23, with Israel heavily bombarding Hezbollah strongholds in south and east Lebanon and Beirut's southern suburbs.</p>

<p>Israel later announced it began ground operations in south Lebanon, and Hezbollah fighters and Israel forces have been battling at the border, with the Iran-backed group repeatedly saying it has faced Israeli infiltration attempts.</p>

<p>In the pre-recorded video also released on social media, Qassem appearing seated at a desk with small Lebanese and Hezbollah flags and a framed image of Nasrallah, in contrast to the deputy chief's two previous, darkly lit speeches since Nasrallah was killed on September 27.</p>

<p>Qassem said his group had begun an "equation of hurting the enemy", repeatedly targeting north Israel's Haifa area and warned that "with the continuation of the war, the number of uninhabited" Israeli towns will increase.</p>

<p>"More than two million people will be in the danger zone," he said.</p>

<p>Hezbollah opened what it says is a "support front" for Gaza from Lebanon, launching cross-border attacks into Israel the day after its Palestinian ally Hamas's October 7, 2023 attack on Israel sparked war in the Gaza Strip.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The UN human rights office said on Tuesday it had received reports that most of the 22 victims of an Israeli air strike on a building in northern Lebanon were women and children.</p>

<p>"What we are hearing is that amongst the 22 people killed were 12 women and two children," UN human rights office spokesperson Jeremy Laurence told a Geneva press briefing in response to a question about a strike on Aitou on Monday.</p>

<p>"We understand it was a four-story residential building that was struck. With these factors in mind, we have real concerns with respect to IHL (International Humanitarian Law), so the laws of war, and the principles of distinction proportion and proportionality," he said, calling for an investigation.</p>

<p>At the same press briefing, the UN refugee agency's Middle East Director Rema Jamous Imseis said that new Israeli evacuation orders to 20 villages in southern Lebanon meant that over a quarter of the country was now affected.</p>

<p>"Now we have over 25% of the country under a direct Israeli military evacuation order," she said. "People are heeding these calls to evacuate, and they're fleeing with almost nothing."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[US Vice President Kamala Harris is under scrutiny due to allegations of plagiarism in a book she co-authored in 2009.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US Vice President Kamala Harris is under scrutiny due to allegations of plagiarism in a book she co-authored in 2009. According to <em>Newsweek</em>, Dr Stefan Weber, a renowned 'plagiarism hunter' from Austria, has claimed that Ms Harris and co-author Joan O'C Hamilton had 27 "fragments of plagiarism" in the book <em>'Smart on Crime: A Career Prosecutor's Plan to Make Us Safer'</em>. Mr Weber and his team also alleged that the Democratic presidential nominee and her co-author copied and pasted from a Wikipedia article for the book.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.newsweek.com/kamala-harris-plagiarism-claim-smart-crime-1968831" rel="noindex, nofollow"><em>Newsweek</em></a>, Mr Weber accused Ms Harris of reproducing verbatim language from sources such as news articles and studies in his report. "Kamala Harris fabricated a source reference, inventing a nonexistent page number. The self-promotional content from Goodwill Industries was copied verbatim without citing the source (Goodwill Industries was her 'primary partner' on in [sic] the 'Back on Track' program)," he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"In many other instances, even when a source was cited with a footnote, the text was directly copied and pasted without using quotation marks. Quotation marks would have been the most transparent and honest approach, also in non-academic books. Further signs of dishonesty may be evident when sources were copied but specific details were altered, such as replacing a Subway store owner with a sandwich shop clerk (p. 124) or highlighting Southeast Asia in the context of the US gang problem (p. 184)," Mr Weber added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Further, the Austrian professor alleged that one particular mention of New York City's Midtown Community Court in the book pertains to its use of language and structure that closely mirrors a Wikipedia article, indicating a lack of proper citation and paraphrasing. Mr Weber also highlighted minor and serious infractions, claiming that some text was directly copied from sources without adequate acknowledgement. In his report, he also showed specific plagiarism allegations regarding a mention of the West Palm Beach Community Court in Ms Harris' book.</p>

<p>"After copying from the Wikipedia article, she continues by copying from the PDF linked in the Wikipedia article's first reference. Although she acknowledges at the end of the book that she took examples of community courts from that report (without providing the URL), the copied sections are presented as if they were her own words. The word-for-word copying still requires quotation marks to maintain proper attribution," Mr Weber wrote.</p>

<p>He also pointed out that while some parts of the appropriate content may be cited, not enough of the original source is acknowledged, a technique known as "pawn sacrifice plagiarism".</p>

<p>Mr Weber even claimed that in 2009, Ms Harris gave a "live" interview about the book to CBS, "which in parts consisted of a prior interview for another media which in turn contains many verbatim text chunks from her book."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, reacting to the accusations, Senator JD Vance trolled Ms Harris for using Wikipedia, claiming that he at least authored his own book. "Lmao Kamala didn't even write her own book!" he tweeted.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Donald Trump Jr. also commented on the issue, writing, "Yikes! More evidence that Kamala Harris is a fraud!!!"</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Maldives president has sacked more than 225 political appointees, including ministers, in a bid to reduce the cash-strapped Indian Ocean nation's expenditure, his office said on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Mohamed Muizzu ordered the removal of those he appointed after coming to power last year as the small but strategically located nation struggles to stave off a debt crisis.</p>

<p>"This significant reduction in political appointments aligns with the president's broader efforts to streamline government operations and ensure more efficient use of public funds," a statement from Muizzu's office said.</p>

<p>Among those sacked were seven state ministers, 43 deputy ministers and 178 political directors.</p>

<p>It was not clear what functions they performed in the tiny nation of about half a million people.</p>

<p>The statement did not say how many more political appointees remained in the administration but added that the mass reduction of staff would save the country about $370,000 a month.</p>

<p>The Maldives said in September its financial troubles were "temporary" and that it had no plans to seek an International Monetary Fund bailout despite warnings of a possible sovereign default.</p>

<p>Known as a luxury holiday destination with pristine white sand beaches and secluded resorts, the Maldives has also become a geopolitical hotspot.</p>

<p>China and India are the two largest bilateral lenders to the Maldives, made up of 1,192 coral islands scattered across the equator.</p>

<p>China has pledged more funding since last year's victory by Muizzu, who thanked Beijing for its "selfless assistance" for development funds.</p>

<p>Muizzu was welcomed in New Delhi this month by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who rolled out financial support to bolster Male's struggling economy.</p>

<p>Official data showed the Maldives' foreign debt at $3.37 billion in the first quarter of this year, equating to around 45 percent of gross domestic product.</p>

<p>China accounted for about 20 percent of the external debt, while India owned just under 18 percent.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

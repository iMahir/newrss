       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Shots were fired during a rally speech by Donald Trump, in an incident that investigators are treating as a possible assassination attempt on the former president.</p>

<p>Including Abraham Lincoln and JFK, here are some notable examples of shootings involving US presidents or presidential candidates:</p>

<p><strong>- Ronald Reagan (1981) -</strong></p>

<p>President Reagan was shot and seriously wounded as he left an event at the Hilton hotel in Washington. The attacker was John Hinckley Jr, who was granted unconditional release in 2022.</p>

<p>Reagan spent twelve days in the hospital. The incident boosted Reagan's popularity, as he displayed humor and resilience during his recovery.</p>

<p><strong>- Gerald Ford (1975) -</strong></p>

<p>President Ford was left unscathed in two separate assassination attempts by women in September 1975, both in California and within a span of just 17 days.</p>

<p><strong>- George Wallace (1972) -</strong></p>

<p>While campaigning for the Democratic presidential nomination, Wallace was shot four times and paralyzed for life at a shopping mall in Laurel, Maryland.</p>

<p>The assassination attempt on Wallace, who was known for his segregationist views and populist appeal, highlighted the ongoing political tensions in the US and potential for domestic violence in the Vietnam war era.</p>

<p><strong>- Robert F. Kennedy (1968) -</strong></p>

<p>President John F. Kennedy's brother Robert, who was running for the Democratic presidential nomination, was shot and killed at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles, California.</p>

<p>The assassination had a profound impact on the 1968 presidential race and occurred just two months after the killing of civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr, adding to the political turmoil of the late 1960s.</p>

<p><strong>- John F. Kennedy (1963) -</strong></p>

<p>Riding in his motorcade with his wife Jackie, President Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas, Texas by Lee Harvey Oswald.</p>

<p>The Warren Commission investigating the assassination concluded in 1964 that Lee Harvey Oswald, a former marine who had lived in the Soviet Union, had acted alone.</p>

<p>Many Americans believe the death of JFK began a more violent period in US politics and society, with the Vietnam War build up and the civil rights struggle as a backdrop.</p>

<p><strong>- Franklin D. Roosevelt (1933) -</strong></p>

<p>As president-elect, FDR was the target of an assassination attempt in Miami, Florida. He was unharmed, but Chicago Mayor Anton Cermak was killed in the attack.</p>

<p><strong>- Theodore Roosevelt (1912) -</strong></p>

<p>Like Trump, Teddy Roosevelt was running for the White House as a former president when he was shot in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.</p>

<p>The bullet, which remained lodged in his chest for the rest of his life, was slowed by the folded 50-page speech and steel eyeglass case in his breast pocket.</p>

<p>Famously, Roosevelt decided to deliver his scheduled speech despite being shot.</p>

<p><strong>- William McKinley (1901) </strong>-</p>

<p>President McKinley was shot and killed by anarchist Leon Czolgosz in Buffalo, New York.</p>

<p><strong>- Abraham Lincoln (1865) -</strong></p>

<p>Lincoln was assassinated by John Wilkes Booth, a well-known actor and Confederate sympathizer, while watching a play called "Our American Cousin" at Ford's Theater in Washington.</p>

<p>Booth's attack, just days after the Confederate surrender in the Civil War, was part of a larger plot that included attempts to assassinate Vice President Andrew Johnson and Secretary of State William Seward.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Violence and no place in politics and democracies, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said this morning, expressing concern over the assassination attempt on former US President Donald Trump at a poll rally in Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>"Deeply concerned by the attack on my friend, former President Donald Trump. Strongly condemn the incident. Violence has no place in politics and democracies. Wish him speedy recovery," Prime Minister Modi posted on X.</p>

— Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) <a href="https://twitter.com/narendramodi/status/1812315611940176344?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 14, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p>"Our thoughts and prayers are with the family of the deceased, those injured and the American people," he added.</p>

<p>Trump was shot at while he was speaking at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania's Butler on Saturday. The 78-year-old has said the bullet pierced his right ear. Visuals from the rally showed security officials rushing him off the state, blood across his face. A bystander was killed and two others critically injured as the shooter fired multiple rounds. He was gunned down by the security personnel, but is yet to be identified.</p>

<p>US President Joe Biden, who faces Trump in the US election due in November, strongly condemned the incident and also spoke to his arch rival after the shooting.</p>

<p>"There's no place in America for this kind of violence. It's sick. It's sick. It's one of the reasons why we have to unite this country... We cannot be like this, we cannot condone this," Biden told reporters in an emergency briefing after the attack on Trump.</p>

<p>"The idea that there's political violence, or violence in America like this, is just unheard of. It's just not appropriate. Everybody, everybody must condemn it. Everybody," Biden said.</p>

<p>"I have been briefed on the shooting at Donald Trump's rally in Pennsylvania. I'm grateful to hear that he's safe and doing well. I'm praying for him and his family and for all those who were at the rally, as we await further information.</p>

<p>Jill and I are grateful to the Secret Service for getting him to safety. There's no place for this kind of violence in America. We must unite as one nation to condemn it," Biden said in a post on X.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump, former US president, was hit in the ear in an apparent assassination attempt by a gunman at a rally in Pennsylvania today, a shocking incident that will fuel fears of instability ahead of the 2024 US presidential election.</p>

<p>The 78-year-old Republican candidate was addressing a fervent crowd when a gunman opened fire, striking Trump in the ear. Blood was visible on his face as US Secret Service swiftly intervened, whisking him offstage to safety.</p>

<p>Ivanka Trump, daughter of the former president, conveyed gratitude for the outpouring of support and concern following the violent incident. In a statement released shortly after the shooting, she expressed deep appreciation for the swift actions of the Secret Service and law enforcement, underscoring their role in averting further tragedy.</p>

<p>"Thank you for your love and prayers for my father and for the other victims of today's senseless violence in Butler, Pennsylvania," Ivanka Trump's statement read. "I am grateful to the Secret Service and all the other law enforcement officers for their quick and decisive actions today. I continue to pray for our country. I love you Dad, today and always."</p>

<p>Thousands of Trump supporters were attending the rally when the shooting, which was captured live on news channels, happened.&nbsp; As the bullet hit his ears, the former president was seen ducking with the secret service surrounding him. He could be heard making a few comments on an audio feed from the stage.&nbsp; Trump said, “Let me get my shoes,” as he was escorted to the safe place. He was seen pumping his fist to the public.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former US President Donald Trump was hit in the ear in an apparent assassination attempt by a gunman at a campaign rally today.</p>

<p>The Secret Service said that the apparent assassination attempt on Donald Trump involved "multiple shots (fired) toward the stage from an elevated position outside the rally venue.</p>

<p>A video has now emerged showing snipers and Secret Service officials in action as shots were fired at Donald Trump.</p>

<p>As the Secret Service officials hear the gunshots, they swarm onto the podium, surround the Republican candidate to escort him off the stage.</p>

<p>Two armed officials were also seen aiming at the gunman after the shots rang out at the rally.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The shooter was later captured and neutralised by the Security Service officials.&nbsp;The shooter's identity and motive were not immediately clear.</p>

<p>The shooting took place shortly after Trump took the stage at his final campaign rally. 78-year-old Trump grimaced and clutched a hand to his right ear, with blood soon visible across his face.</p>

<p>He turned back to the crowd and repeatedly raised his fist as the security officials surrounded him, in what is set to become an iconic image.</p>

<p>"I was shot with a bullet that pierced the upper part of my right ear," Donald Trump later posted on Truth Social.</p>

<p>"I knew immediately that something was wrong in that I heard a whizzing sound, shots, and immediately felt the bullet ripping through the skin," Trump said.</p>

<p>The leader, who was seen with blood on his right ear, was quickly swarmed by Secret Service agents who encircled the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/donald-trump-evacuated-from-pennsylvaniarally-stage-after-apparent-shots-heard-report-6100727">former president </a>and escorted him off stage. While being whisked off, he raised his fist to the crowd and mouthed "fight, fight".</p>

<p>In a photo, purportedly captured moments before he was <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/video-moment-donald-trump-was-attacked-at-pennsylvania-rally-6100971">attacked</a>, a bullet can be seen whizzing past his face.

<p>A witness has claimed that he saw the man who fired at Trump on the roof of a building near the event grounds. Talking to the BBC, he said that the shooter was armed with a rifle and had crawled on top of the building. "The guy crawled up the building 50 feet from us. He had a rifle," he said.</p>

<p>He said that he informed police, Secret Service about a suspicious man on a roof with a rifle. "I'm thinking to myself 'Why is Trump still speaking, why have they not pulled him off the stage'... the next thing you know, five shots ring out," he told the BBC.</p>

<p>Taking to Truth Social, a social media company owned by him, the former US president said he was "shot with a bullet that pierced the upper part of my right ear."

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gaza ceasefire talks have been halted after three days of intense negotiations failed to produce a viable outcome, two Egyptian security sources said on Saturday, blaming Israel for lacking a genuine intent to reach agreement.</p>

<p>The sources, who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity, said that the behaviour of the Israeli mediators revealed "internal discord".</p>

<p>According to the sources, the Israeli delegation would give approvals on several conditions under discussion, but then come back with amendments or introduce new conditions that risked sinking the negotiations.</p>

<p>The sources said the mediators viewed the "contradictions, delays in responses, and the introduction of new terms contrary to what was previously agreed" as signs the Israeli side viewed the talks as a formality aimed at influencing public opinion.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former US President Donald Trump was shot at an election rally in a possible assassination attempt just a day before the Republican Party is scheduled to begin its convention to formally declare him its nominee for the White House.</p>

<p>Trump touched the right side of his face after what seemed like the first two shots and dropped to the ground. Secret Service agents threw themselves on him to protect him. When they rose, the agents had him inside a circle.</p>

<p>"During former President Trump's campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, on the evening of July 13 at around 6:15 p.m., a suspected shooter fired multiple shots toward the stage from an elevated position outside of the rally venue. US Secret Service personnel neutralised the shooter, who is now deceased. The US Secret Service quickly responded with protective measures and the former President is safe and being evaluated. One spectator was killed, and two spectators were critically injured. The incident is currently under investigation and the Secret Service has formally notified the Federal Bureau of Investigation,"&nbsp;the Secret Service said in a statement:</p>

<p>The former President appeared to be bleeding on the right side of the face. He raised a fist in the air as he was led away. He was taken to a local medical facility for treatment.</p>

<p>"I was shot with a bullet that pierced the upper part of my right ear," former President Trump said in a post on Truth Social, the media platform he launched after he was banished from Twitter, which is now called X.</p>

<p>"I knew immediately that something was wrong in that I heard a whizzing sound, and shots, and immediately felt the bullet ripping through the skin. Much bleeding took place, so I realised then what was happening."</p>

<p>The shooter, who remains unidentified, was shot dead.</p>

<p>Local authorities said he was in a low-rise building outside the rally venue.</p>

<p>A member of the audience is also dead. Another person was grievously wounded.</p>

<p>President Joe Biden said in remarks to the nation that he had tried to speak to Trump -- addressing him as "Donald" for probably the first time in public.</p>

<p>"I plan on talking to them shortly, he said, adding, "There's no place in America for this kind of violence. It's sick sick… The bottom line is (the) rally should have been conducted peacefully without any problem."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A witness has claimed that he saw the man - who fired at Donald Trump while he was addressing a campaign rally - positioned on the roof of a building near the event grounds.</p>

<p>Greg told the BBC that the shooter was armed with a rifle and had crawled on top of the building.</p>

<p>"The guy crawled up the building 50 feet from us. He had a rifle," he said.</p>

<p>He said that he informed police, Secret Service about a suspicious man on a roof with a rifle.</p>

<p>"I'm thinking to myself 'Why is Trump still speaking, why have they not pulled him off the stage'... the next thing you know, five shots ring out," he told the BBC.</p>

<p>The shooting took place shortly after Trump took the stage at his final campaign rally. 78-year-old Trump grimaced and clutched a hand to his right ear, with blood soon visible across his face.</p>

<p>Secret Service agents swarmed onto the podium, surrounded the Republican candidate and escorted him roughly off the stage, as Trump raised a fist to the crowd in defiance.</p>

<p>His campaign said he was "fine" and being checked at a medical facility.</p>

<p>"I was shot with a bullet that pierced the upper part of my right ear," Donald Trump later posted on Truth Social.</p>

<p>"I knew immediately that something was wrong in that I heard a whizzing sound, shots, and immediately felt the bullet ripping through the skin," Trump said.</p>

<p>The apparent assassination attempt on Donald Trump involved "multiple shots (fired) toward the stage from an elevated position outside the rally venue," the US Secret Service said, adding the shooter has been killed.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<ol>
	<li>The 78-year-old leader was seen ducking on the podium as rapid shots rang out at the rally. He was quickly surrounded by Secret Service agents who escorted him off the stage. The Republican nominee was seen raising his fist and mouthing "fight, fight" as he was whisked off the stage.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>The Secret Service, a law enforcement agency that protects US political leaders, said that multiple shots were fired from an "elevated position" outside the rally venue.</li>
	<li>"I think that's something that we're going to have to figure out how he got there," Butler County district attorney Richard Goldinger told news agency AFP.</li>
	<li>According to local media, the suspected shooter has died. "Butler County District Attorney Richard Goldinger said two people are dead, including an apparent shooter," The Washington Post said. One spectator died from injuries at a hospital while two others are in a critical condition.</li>
	<li>Taking to Truth Social, a social media company owned by Trump, the former US president said he was "shot with a bullet that pierced the upper part of my right ear."</li>
	<li>"I knew immediately that something was wrong in that I heard a whizzing sound, shots, and immediately felt the bullet ripping through the skin," he said.</li>
	<li>The attack has united US political leaders on both sides the spectrum with Trump's rival and US President Joe Biden condemning the attack, saying there was "no place in America for this kind of violence".</li>
	<li>"It's sick. It's one of the reasons why we have to unite this country... We cannot be like this, we cannot condone this. The idea that there's political violence, or violence in America like this, is just unheard of. It's just not appropriate. Everybody, everybody must condemn it," he said, adding that he will speak to Trump shortly.</li>
	<li>Former presidents Barack Obama and George W Bush have also slammed the "cowardly" attack.</li>
	<li>"Although we don't yet know exactly what happened, we should all be relieved that former President Trump wasn't seriously hurt, and use this moment to recommit ourselves to civility and respect in our politics," Obama said.&nbsp;</li>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former US president Donald Trump, in his first account of being shot at during a rally in Pennysylvania today said, "I was shot with a bullet that pierced the upper part of my right ear."</p>

<p>"I knew immediately that something was wrong in that I heard a whizzing sound, shots, and immediately felt the bullet ripping through the skin," Trump, who was not seriously injured, said on his Truth Social site.</p>

<p>The former President is "fine and is being checked out at a local medical facility," Trump Communications Director Steven Cheung said in a statement.</p>

<p>The incident took place about seven minutes into the rally in Butler, in western Pennsylvania, on Saturday. Thousands of Trump supporters were attending the rally when the shooting, which was captured live on news channels, happened.&nbsp; As the bangs ran out, the 78-year-old was seen ducking with the secret service surrounding him. He could be heard making a few comments on an audio feed from the stage.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Secret Service agents swarmed onto the podium, surrounded the Republican candidate and escorted him roughly off the stage, as Trump raised a fist to the crowd in defiance.</p>

<p>Trump said, “Let me get my shoes,” as he was escorted to the safe place.</p>

<p>The shocking incident happened two days before the start of the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, where Trump will formally become the party's nominee.</p>

<p>"I want to thank The United States Secret Service, and all of Law Enforcement, for their rapid response on the shooting that just took place in Butler, Pennsylvania. Most importantly, I want to extend my condolences to the family of the person at the Rally who was killed, and also to the family of another person that was badly injured," Trump said in his post.</p>

<p>"It is incredible that such an act can take place in our Country. Nothing is known at this time about the shooter, who is now dead. I was shot with a bullet that pierced the upper part of my right ear. I knew immediately that something was wrong in that I heard a whizzing sound, shots, and immediately felt the bullet ripping through the skin. Much bleeding took place, so I realized then what was happening. GOD BLESS AMERICA," he added.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden led the condemnation after his election rival Donald Trump was wounded in an apparent assassination attempt at a rally in Pennsylvania on Saturday, in violence that also left a bystander dead.</p>

<p>Political leaders on both sides of the aisle slammed the attack minutes after the Republican candidate was rushed off stage by the Secret Service with blood running down his face.</p>

<p>"There's no place in America for this kind of violence. It's sick. It's sick. It's one of the reasons why we have to unite this country... We cannot be like this, we cannot condone this," Biden told reporters in an emergency briefing at Rehoboth Beach in Delaware.</p>

<p>"The idea that there's political violence, or violence in America like this, is just unheard of. It's just not appropriate. Everybody, everybody must condemn it. Everybody," Biden said.</p>

<p>He said he hoped to speak with Trump "shortly."</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Vice President Kamala Harris said on X: "We are praying for him, his family, and all those who have been injured and impacted by this senseless shooting."</p>

<p>Biden's former boss, Barack Obama, echoed his words in a statement, saying there was "absolutely no place for political violence in our democracy."</p>

<p>"Although we don't yet know exactly what happened, we should all be relieved that former President Trump wasn't seriously hurt, and use this moment to recommit ourselves to civility and respect in our politics," the Democrat said on X.</p>

<p>Former president George W. Bush condemned the "cowardly" attack.</p>

<p>"Laura and I are grateful that President Trump is safe following the cowardly attack on his life. And we commend the men and women of the Secret Service for their speedy response," the Republican said in a statement.</p>

<p>From the Senate, top Democrat Chuck Schumer said he was "horrified by what happened at the Trump rally in Pennsylvania and relieved that former President Trump is safe. Political violence has no place in our country."</p>

<p>His Republican counterpart Mitch McConnell also posted: "Tonight, all Americans are grateful that President Trump appears to be fine after a despicable attack on a peaceful rally. Violence has no place in our politics."</p>

<p>"As one whose family has been the victim of political violence, I know firsthand that political violence of any kind has no place in our society," former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, whose husband was attacked in a home invasion in 2022, wrote, also on X.</p>

<p>"I thank God that former President Trump is safe. As we learn more details about this horrifying incident, let us pray that all those in attendance at the former President's rally today are unharmed," she continued.</p>

<p><strong>'I love you Dad'</strong></p>

<p>Trump's shocked children also took to social media.</p>

<p>"This is the fighter America needs!" son Eric Trump wrote above a photo of his father with blood running down his cheek, his fist in the air and an American flag waving in the background as the Secret Service rushed him from the stage.</p>

<p>Donald Trump Jr posted the same photo, writing on X: "He'll never stop fighting to Save America."</p>

<p>"I love you Dad, today and always," daughter Ivanka posted on X, thanking supporters as well as the Secret Service for their "quick and decisive actions today."</p>

<p>"I continue to pray for our country," she said.</p>

<p>Tech billionaire Elon Musk said Saturday that he "fully" endorses Trump after the rally violence.</p>

<p>"I fully endorse President Trump and hope for his rapid recovery," Musk wrote on X, as he shared a video of Trump pumping his fist while being escorted away by Secret Service officials.</p>

<p>"Had it been less than a half inch to the right, he would not have survived," the Republican governor of Texas, Greg Abbott, posted on X.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump narrowly escaped an assassination attempt while delivering a speech at a rally in Pennsylvania today, when several gunshots were fired at him. The former US President was evacuated from stage by security agents and is said to be fine.</p>

<p>In a video that captures the moment the horrifying incident happened, Donald Trump can be seen delivering his speech amongst a big crowd of his supporters when several gunshots are heard. After the first couple of gunshots that took Donald Trump unawares, he can be seen touching his right ear before ducking to take cover behind the stage dias. The crowd behind him, visibly confused and scared, also ducks to dodge any bullet.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Secret Service agents are quick to come to Trump's rescue as they cover and take him off the stage. Trump, whose right ear can be seen bleeding, raises his fist in the air while being evacuated.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Trump is "fine" and is being checked at a medical facility, his campaign said after the attack.

       <description><![CDATA[Republican candidate Donald Trump was evacuated from the stage at a rally on Saturday after what sounded like shots rang out at the event in Pennsylvania, according to AFP.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former US president Donald Trump was "safe" after he was rushed off stage when gunshots were fired at a campaign rally on Saturday in Pennsylvania, in a shocking incident that will fuel anxiety in the run-up to the 2024 election.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As the bangs ran out, 78-year-old Trump grimaced and clutched a hand to his right ear, with blood soon visible across his face.</p>

<p>Secret Service agents swarmed onto the podium, surrounded the Republican candidate and escorted him roughly off the stage, as Trump raised a fist to the crowd in defiance.</p>

<p>The suspected shooter was confirmed dead, along with one bystander, US media reported.</p>

<p>"The former president is safe," the Secret Service said in a post on X.</p>

<p>His campaign said he was "fine" and being checked at a medical facility.</p>

<p>"President Trump thanks law enforcement and first responders for their quick action during this heinous act. He is fine and is being checked out at a local medical facility," said spokesman Steven Cheung in a statement.</p>

<p>President Joe Biden, who is set to face Trump in a bitter replay of their 2020 clash, said there was "no place for this kind of violence in America."</p>

<p>"I'm grateful to hear that he's safe and doing well," Biden said in a statement, adding: "I'm praying for him and his family and for all those who were at the rally."</p>

<p>The 81-year-old, staying at his house in Rehoboth, Delaware, gave a televised statement repeating his message, saying "we cannot be like this."</p>

<p>The shooting ramps up tension in a country already on edge about the prospect of unrest and political harassment before the November election.</p>

<p>It took place shortly after Trump took the stage at his final campaign rally before the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee next week.</p>

<p><strong>Shooter Dead</strong></p>

<p>"Butler County District Attorney Richard Goldinger said two people are dead, including an apparent shooter," The Washington Post reported. A second bystander may also have been hit.</p>

<p>The rally in Butler, Pennsylvania descended into chaos after shots were heard and screams and shouts rang out.</p>

<p>"Let me get my shoes," Trump was heard saying on microphone, as security agents helped him back to his feet.</p>

<p>He turned back to the crowd and repeatedly raised his fist, as well as mouthing words that weren't immediately discernable, in what is set to become an iconic image.</p>

<p>Agents bundled the 78-year-old tycoon into an SUV, as he once more raised his fist to the crowd.</p>

<p>"This is an active crime scene," Secret Service officers told reporters, ordering them out of the area.</p>

<p>"We saw a lot of people go down, looking confused. I heard the shots," said John Yeykal from Franklin, Pennsylvania, who was attending his first Trump rally.</p>

<p>US politicians reacted with shock to the incident.</p>

<p>Former president Barack Obama said there was "absolutely no place for political violence in our democracy."</p>

<p>"Although we don't yet know exactly what happened, we should all be relieved that former President Trump wasn't seriously hurt, and use this moment to recommit ourselves to civility and respect in our politics," he said.</p>

<p>Republican minority leader Mitch McConnell added: "Tonight, all Americans are grateful that President Trump appears to be fine after a despicable attack on a peaceful rally. Violence has no place in our politics."</p>

<p>Billionaire Elon Musk reacted by quickly endorsing Trump.</p>

<p>"I fully endorse President Trump and hope for his rapid recovery," Musk wrote on X, which he owns along with car manufacturer Tesla, as he shared a video of Trump pumping his fist while being escorted away.</p>

<p>The United States has a history of political violence and presidents, former presidents and candidates have tight security.</p>

<p>President John F. Kennedy was assassinated in 1963 while riding in his motorcade, and his brother Bobby Kenndy was shot dead in 1968. President Ronald Reagan survived an assassination attempt in 1981.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a rare occurrence, a 22-year-old man died of primary amoebic meningoencephalitis (PAM) in Pakistan's Karachi, taking the tally of casualties to three this year, ARY News reported.</p>

<p>PAM is notably a disease of the central nervous system caused by Naegleria fowleri commonly called 'brain-eating' amoeba.</p>

<p>The victim was identified as Aurangzeb. He contracted the disease following a picnic with his friends at a farmhouse in Quaidabad on July 7, where the group had also gone for a swim. The next day, Aurangzeb started showing symptoms, which included nausea and fever.</p>

<p>He was admitted to the hospital on July 10, and the virus was confirmed on July 11. A resident of Cattle Colony, Aurangzeb, was under treatment at the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC), as per ARY News.</p>

<p>The youth had gone for a picnic with friends at a farmhouse in Quaidabad on July 7, where they swam in the pool. Aurangzeb started showing symptoms on July 8, including fever, headache, and nausea. He was admitted to the hospital on July 10, and the virus was confirmed on July 11.</p>

<p>The 22-year-old Aurangzeb was the third victim of the deadly infection this year in the city, with the other two cases reported in Korangi and Malir earlier, according to ARY News.</p>

<p>The infection has claimed the lives of people across various regions of Pakistan earlier as well. At least 10 people died of Naegleria fowleri last year. The infection is found to be fatal in 98 per cent of the cases.</p>

<p>Naegleria, a free-living amoeba, is frequently found in warm, freshwater (lakes, rivers, and hot springs) and soil.</p>

<p>Only one species, Naegleria fowleri, infects humans.</p>

<p>It infects people when water containing the amoeba enters the body via the nose. This often occurs when people swim, dive, or submerge their heads in fresh water, such as lakes and rivers. The amoeba then travels up the nose and into the brain, where it damages brain tissue and causes PAM, according to ARY News.</p>

<p>After symptoms begin, the disease progresses rapidly and usually causes death within five days. The germ cannot survive in cool, clean and chlorinated water.</p>

<p>The earliest symptoms of PAM often appear approximately five days after infection and may include headache, fever, nausea, or vomiting. Later symptoms may include a stiff neck, confusion, loss of attention to people and surroundings, seizures, hallucinations, and coma.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>OpenAI whistleblowers have filed a complaint with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, calling for an investigation over the artificial intelligence company's allegedly restrictive non-disclosure agreements, the Washington Post reported on Saturday, citing a copy of the letter sent to the SEC.</p>

<p>The whistleblowers alleged that OpenAI issued overly restrictive employment, severance, and nondisclosure agreements to its employees, which could have led to penalties against workers who raised concerns about OpenAI to federal authorities, according to the newspaper.</p>

<p>The AI company made employees sign agreements that required them to waive their federal rights to whistleblower compensation, according to the letter seen by the Washington Post.</p>

<p>The agreements also required that employees get prior consent from the company if they wanted to disclose information to federal regulators, the newspaper said, adding that OpenAI did not create exemptions in the employee nondisparagement clauses for disclosing securities violations to the SEC.</p>

<p>An SEC spokesperson said in an emailed statement that it does not comment on the existence or nonexistence of a possible whistleblower submission.</p>

<p>OpenAI did not immediately respond to requests for a comment on the Washington Post report.</p>

<p>OpenAI's chatbots with generative AI capabilities, such as engaging in human-like conversations and creating images based on text prompts, have stirred safety concerns as AI models become powerful.</p>

<p>OpenAI in May formed a Safety and Security Committee that will be led by board members, including CEO Sam Altman, as it begins training its next artificial intelligence model.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As Joe Biden's verbal gaffes, shaky voice, and other troubling signs have brought an intense focus on the US President's mental acuity, health experts are calling on him and rival Donald Trump to pass additional cognitive tests, even while warning against leaping to conclusions.</p>

<p>Such tests, experts said, could either help repudiate speculation that the 81-year-old president's mental state is in worrying decline -- or else confirm it -- and could enlighten voters on the mental abilities of Trump, who has had his own share of verbal lapses.</p>

<p>But reliable diagnoses, they caution, cannot be made from afar.</p>

<p>Since Biden's disastrous performance in his debate with Trump two weeks ago, the Democrat's campaign has faced fierce opposition. A growing number of officials in his own party are questioning his ability to lead the country for four more years.</p>

<p>And it didn't help when at a summit in Washington earlier this week Biden mistakenly introduced Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky as his foe Vladimir Putin, before quickly correcting himself.</p>

<p>Dennis Selkoe, a neurologist at Harvard Medical School, said the fundamental issue is whether Biden is suffering from "a normal age-related process" or "something that represents a neurologic disease."</p>

<p>"Making a mistake with a name is not automatically a sign of dementia or of Alzheimer's," he told AFP.</p>

<p>But Selkoe, who sees many patients with neurodegenerative problems, said Biden does seem to have the "appearance of an early Parkinson patient" -- including his slow, stiff gait and his low, sometimes barely audible voice, which could be a condition known as hypophonia.</p>

<p><strong>Detailed Tests</strong></p>

<p>In February, Biden underwent a complete physical exam. A published summary of its results indicated that an "extremely detailed neurologic exam" had ruled out Parkinson's.</p>

<p>However, no detail was provided on the exact nature of the tests or their results.</p>

<p>Could a neurological illness have taken root over just the past five months? If the exams in February had been comprehensive, Selkoe said, there should have been early signs of a nascent condition.</p>

<p>In an editorial in March, the scientific journal Lancet called for standardized procedures to examine the health of sitting and prospective presidents to insulate American voters from a "pestilence of speculation, misinformation, and slander."</p>

<p>Absent such reliable testing, "the US public remains beholden to voluntarily released reports from politicians' personal physicians," the journal said.</p>

<p>Jay Olshansky, an expert in aging at the University of Illinois at Chicago, sounded a similar note, saying, "We think the time has arrived for complete transparency."</p>

<p>He urged both major presidential candidates to pass a cognitive test, something former president Trump has frequently challenged Biden to do.</p>

<p>Several such exams, including those known as the MMSE and the MoCA, are available either for an initial screening or as part of a more comprehensive battery of tests.</p>

<p>Biden has said that he effectively passes a cognitive test every day, simply by carrying out his presidential duties.</p>

<p>But "I don't think it's the same," Selkoe said. Being able to conduct familiar tasks one has done for years is one thing, he said, while being able to repeat a list of words heard five minutes earlier, as some tests require, is another.</p>

<p>At a news conference Thursday, the President said he would be willing to take a new neurological exam if his doctors recommended it, but that "no one is suggesting that to me now."</p>

<p><strong>Stereotypes On Aging</strong></p>

<p>Aging changes one's brain, said Allison Sekuler, president of the Baycrest Academy, a hospital specializing in elderly care.</p>

<p>"Garbage is basically building up in the brain," she told AFP, adding that parts of the brain atrophy, or shrink, including parts important to memory.</p>

<p>An early phase known as "mild cognitive impairment" can sometimes develop into Alzheimer's or some other form of dementia, she said.</p>

<p>During their recent debate, both Biden and Trump -- who is 78 -- "exhibited some sort of issues in terms of being able to stay on track with a question," Sekuler said, recommending that both men undergo testing.</p>

<p>But, she added, "we're really only talking about one of them right now because that aligns with our stereotype of what aging is."</p>

<p>Olshansky also denounced what he called "raging" ageism, citing a recent magazine cover that used a walker as a symbol of the Biden-Trump race.</p>

<p>He noted that while there is a lower age limit for would-be US presidents -- they must be at least 35 -- there is no upper limit.</p>

<p>What he called "crystallized intelligence," or the ability to use past experience to improve one's reasoning skills, "gets stronger and stronger" with age.</p>

<p>Olshansky co-authored a 2020 study that gave Biden a 95 percent chance of surviving a first term, based on average life expectancy for someone of his age, plus personal risk factors.</p>

<p>But a similar calculation four years later, on a man now four years older, gave Biden a much lower probability of survival: just 75 percent.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

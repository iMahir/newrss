       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Authorities in Japan urged people to avoid hoarding as anxiety over a possible megaquake triggered a spike Saturday in demand for disaster kits and daily necessities.</p>

<p>In its first such advisory, the weather agency said a huge earthquake was more likely in the aftermath of a magnitude 7.1 jolt in the south on Thursday which left 14 people injured.</p>

<p>At a Tokyo supermarket on Saturday, a sign was put up apologising to customers for shortages of certain products it attributed to "quake-related media reports".</p>

<p>"Potential sales restrictions are on the way", the sign said, adding bottled water was already being rationed due to "unstable" procurement.</p>

<p>On Saturday morning the website of Japanese e-commerce giant Rakuten showed portable toilets, preserved food and bottled water topping the list of the most sought-after items.</p>

<p>In Tokyo, some residents were ramping up their disaster preparedness.</p>

<p>Bar employee Kokoro Takeuchi said she had ordered bottled water online following Thursday's tremor.</p>

<p>"I'm very worried," the 27-year-old told AFP.</p>

<p>"The bar I work at is underground so if a quake happens all of a sudden, there's a good chance we might not be able to escape. So I've been trying to figure out how best to evacuate," she said.</p>

<p>But others were more resigned to the inevitability of the megaquake.</p>

<p>"I am worried of course, but overthinking about it will get you nowhere", company worker Mika Nakagawa, 34, told AFP.</p>

<p>"If it happens, then that's that," she said.</p>

<p>Some retailers along the Pacific coastline also reported similar disaster-related supplies in high demand, according to local media reports.</p>

<p>The advisory concerns the Nankai Trough "subduction zone" between two tectonic plates in the Pacific Ocean, where massive earthquakes have hit in the past.</p>

<p>- Low risk -</p>

<p>It has been the site of destructive quakes of magnitude eight or nine every century or two, with the central government previously estimating the next big one would strike over the next 30 years roughly with a 70 percent probability.</p>

<p>Experts however emphasise the risk, while elevated, is still low, and the agriculture and fisheries ministry urged people "to refrain from excessively hoarding goods".</p>

<p>A magnitude-5.3 tremor rocked the Kanagawa region near Tokyo Friday, triggering emergency alarms on mobile phones and briefly suspending bullet train operations.</p>

<p>Most seismologists believe the Friday jolt had no direct link to the Nankai Trough megaquake, citing distance.</p>

<p>On social media platform X, spam posts taking advantage of fears over the megaquake are rapidly mushrooming.</p>

<p>Public broadcaster NHK said spam disguised as helpful quake-related tips was being posted every few seconds on X, with links that instead direct users toward porn or e-commerce sites.</p>

<p>Such posts are "making it increasingly difficult for users to reach genuine information about quakes", NHK said.</p>

<p>Sitting on top of four major tectonic plates, the Japanese archipelago of 125 million people sees some 1,500 quakes every year, most of them minor.</p>

<p>On January 1, a 7.6-sized jolt and powerful aftershocks hit the Noto Peninsula on the Sea of Japan coast, killing at least 318 people, toppling buildings and knocking out roads.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Days after Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's resignation as Bangladesh Prime Minister, the country's Chief Justice Obaidul Hassan also agreed to vacate his post "in principle".]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Days after Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's resignation as Bangladesh Prime Minister, the country's Chief Justice Obaidul Hassan also agreed to vacate his post "in principle". The decision came after the protestors gathered outside the court in the capital Dhaka and demanded the resignation of Hassan and the justices of the Appellate Division.</p>

<p>Mr Hassan, appointed last year, was considered loyal to ousted PM Sheikh Hasina, who fled the country on Monday and has since been sheltering in New Delhi.</p>

<p>Mr Hassan will be tendering his resignation after consulting President Mohammed Shahabuddin this evening, Dhaka Tribune reported, adding that Army personnel were stationed in the main and annexe building as well as other areas around the Supreme Court as they urged hundreds of protesters gathered there to maintain peace.</p>

<p>Obaidul Hassan earlier oversaw the much-criticised war crimes tribunal, which ordered the execution of Sheikh Hasina's opponents. His brother was her longtime secretary.</p>

<p>More than 450 people have been killed so far in the student-led protests that started in July against quotas in government jobs before they also started calling for Hasina's resignation.</p>

<p>Post Hasina's sudden resignation, some of the top appointees, including the central bank governor and the national police chief, were forced out of office, AFP reported.</p>

<p><strong>Appeal for unity</strong></p>

<p>Bangladesh's interim leader Muhammad Yunus on Saturday called for religious unity as he embraced the weeping mother of student protestor Abu Sayed. The 25-year-old was among the first ones to be killed in police firing on July 16 during the Anti-Discrimination Student Movement.</p>

<p>"Our responsibility is to build a new Bangladesh," said Yunus, who returned from Europe this week.</p>

<p>The caretaker administration in the country has stated that restoration of law and order is its "priority".</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the police union declared a strike a few days ago, saying its personnel would not return to work until their safety was assured. As per reports, more than half of the country's police stations were reopened by Saturday.</p>

<p><strong>Attack on minorities</strong></p>

<p>The fall of the Sheikh Hasina-led government has triggered both jubilation and acts of vandalism in Bangladesh. Protestors earlier ransacked her official residence in Dhaka, while the statues of her father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, were defaced and brought down.</p>

<p>Multiple reports and TV footage have shown vandalism, looting and attacks on the minorities and their place of worship, Reuters reported.</p>

<p>Hindus constitute about 8% of the Muslim-majority Bangladesh, which has a total population of nearly 170 million people. They have largely supported Hasina's Awami League party in polls.</p>

<p>On Friday, the Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council wrote to Yunus asking him to protect the minorities, claiming their homes, businesses and temples were being targeted.</p>

<p>Hundreds of Hindus held a protest march on Friday and shouted slogans demanding peace.</p>

<p><strong>How protests started</strong></p>

<p>Nationwide protests in the South Asian country started after the High Court reinstated a quota system that reserved 30 per cent of government jobs for the family members of freedom fighters and veterans from Bangladesh's 1971 War of Independence.</p>

<p>However, this order was later suspended by the Supreme Court. The quota system was scrapped by Sheikh Hasina's government in 2018 following similar student-led protests.</p>

<p><strong>Protestors' demand</strong></p>

<p>The protestors demanded the government scrap the quota system, claiming that it was majorly benefitting only the Awami League.</p>

<p><strong>What is Bangladesh's quota system?</strong></p>

<p>Introduced in 1972, the quota system in the country has since undergone several changes. Before being abolished in 2018, the system back then reserved 56 per cent of seats in government jobs for various groups. However, the majority of these quotas were benefitting the freedom fighters' families.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two prominent Indian-American lawmakers have sought the US' direct intervention to stop the "coordinated attacks" against minority Hindus in Bangladesh, underlining that instability in the region, "fuelled by religious intolerance and violence", is not in the interest of America or its allies.</p>

<p>Members of minority communities in Bangladesh faced at least 205 incidents of attacks in 52 districts since the fall of the Sheikh Hasina-led government on August 5, according to two Hindu organisations -- Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council and the Bangladesh Puja Udjapan Parishad -- in the violence-hit nation.</p>

<p>Thousands of Bangladeshi Hindus have been trying to flee to neighbouring India to escape the violence.</p>

<p>In a letter dated August 9 to Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Congressman Shri Thanedar said he is not alone in his stance against the atrocities being committed against Hindus in Bangladesh. Many in the international community, including some from his own district, have condemned the violent actions being committed against minority groups in Bangladesh.</p>

<p>"With Muhammad Yunus stepping up as the interim Prime Minister for Bangladesh, the United States has an obligation to assist this new government, to ensure that violence and civil unrest comes to an end. I urge the Biden administration to grant persecuted Bangladesh Hindus and other religious minorities temporary protected status as refugees," the Congressman from Michigan wrote to Blinken.</p>

<p>Mr Yunus, the 84-year-old Nobel laureate, was sworn in on Thursday as the head of an interim government in Bangladesh.</p>

<p>A number of Hindu temples, households and businesses were vandalised, women assaulted and at least two Hindu leaders affiliated with the Awami League party headed by Hasina were killed in the violence in Bangladesh after she fled the country, according to community leaders in Dhaka.</p>

<p>Mr Thanedar urged Mr Blinken to work closely with Yunus and his government to bring "an end to the coordinated attacks against the Bangladesh Hindus".</p>

<p>He underlined that Mr Yunus has called for an end to the violence and welcomed his willingness to rebuild the country.</p>

<p>"This is a critical time for Bangladesh, and we must do everything we can to support them in their efforts to bring an end to the violent actions and rhetoric being targeted towards Hindus in the country," said the Indian-American lawmaker.</p>

<p>In a letter dated August 8 to Mr Blinken, a copy of which was released to the press on Friday, Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi said credible eyewitness reports of the anti-Hindu attacks in various media reports demonstrate the scale of the attacks.</p>

<p>"I am writing to you regarding the fluid situation in Bangladesh and the rise of coordinated anti-Hindu violence in the wake of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's resignation. Now that Muhammad Yunus has been sworn in as Chief Adviser for the interim government, it is of utmost urgency that the United States engage with his government for both bringing the violence to an end and the perpetrators to justice," Mr Krishnamoorthi wrote.</p>

<p>"Sadly, this is not the first time that anti-government protests in Bangladesh have metastasised into anti-Hindu violence. The anti-Hindu riots in October 2021 left nine people dead amidst the destruction of hundreds of homes, businesses and temples...In 2017, more than 107 Hindus were killed and 37 'disappeared'...following the International Crimes Tribunal conviction of Jamaat-e-Islami leader Delwar Sayeedi for war crimes," he said.</p>

<p>Mr Krishnamoorthi underlined that instability in the region, "fuelled by religious intolerance and violence, is clearly not in the interest of the United States or our allies".</p>

<p>He urged Mr Blinken to engage "directly" with the interim government and exert US influence to help his administration end the violence and "bring those responsible to justice".</p>

<p>Mr Thanedar in his letter noted that political violence in Bangladesh is not a new phenomenon and that the country has experienced many coups and leadership changes since its inception in 1971.</p>

<p>Targeting of its Hindu population is also not new. Hindus only make up eight per cent of Bangladesh's population, exposing this minority to risk of discrimination and violence, the Congressman said.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With its sleek interior and freshly ground coffee, the cafe run by Belarusian exile Sasha Avdevich may at first glance seem like yet another trendy spot in Warsaw.</p>

<p>But the lowered, wheelchair-accessible countertop and a sticker reading: "The barista on shift has a hearing impairment" in Polish, English and Belarusian reveal this is no ordinary business.</p>

<p>Avdevich, himself a wheelchair user, founded the first "Inclusive Barista" coffee shop while still in Belarus and quickly shot to fame as a disability campaigner in the country controlled with an iron fist by strongman President Alexander Lukashenko.</p>

<p>The 40-year-old activist took part in the unprecedented mass protests that swept Belarus after a 2020 election slammed by rights groups as fraudulent.</p>

<p>As Lukashenko brutally cracked down on dissent, Avdevich knew he had to flee.</p>

<p>"A lot of people called me back then and said, 'Sasha, if you don't want to end up in a coffin, leave the country,'" he told AFP.</p>

<p>He recounted the Covid pandemic-era journey that saw him flee to Georgia initially, then travel on to the Canary Islands before applying for international protection in France.</p>

<p>He eventually moved to Poland, now home to tens of thousands of fellow Belarusians, who, like Avdevich, fled the repression.</p>

<p>"There are many migrants with disabilities," Avdevich said.</p>

<h3><strong>Rap battle, speed dating&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>As he settled in Warsaw, Avdevich launched barista training for people in wheelchairs, threw festivals where the trainees brewed coffee from specially adapted carts, and began to draw up plans for his first cafe in Poland.</p>

<p>When he found a commercial space suited to people with disabilities, close to his flat and in the city's increasingly popular Praga district, Avdevich and his business partner decided to give it a shot.</p>

<p>"We had money for three months of rent, and we were like: 'Come on, whatever happens, we'll do it,'" he said.</p>

<p>Opened in April, the cafe hires people with various disabilities as well as migrants, not only from Belarus.</p>

<p>The founders said they want their cafe to be as "international" -- and inclusive -- as possible.</p>

<p>"We recently organised a rap battle, we will organise a speed dating event soon," Avdevich said.</p>

<p>The cafe is also launching an inclusive DJing school.</p>

<p>Avdevich lost the use of his legs when he broke his back in a motorbike accident in 2011.</p>

<p>"There's no surgery for this type of disability... it's not possible to walk again, even if I was Bill Gates," Avdevich laughed.</p>

<p>Shortly after the accident, he said he told himself "OK, I'm alive. What can I do? I have working arms.</p>

<p>"And now we're here, in our coffee shop, making this world better."</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Twin jailbreaks in Bangladesh killed at least 12 inmates and freed hundreds more in the chaotic days after the ouster of autocratic premier Sheikh Hasina, officials told AFP Saturday.</p>

<p>An interim government is struggling to restore law and order with police going on strike after Hasina's sudden resignation and flight abroad after 15 years in power.</p>

<p>This week's prison escapes, both north of the capital Dhaka, are the latest in a series of breakouts during weeks of nationwide unrest leading up to her toppling.</p>

<p>Six convicts were killed at Jamapur Prison on Thursday after prison guards were assaulted by escapees, warden Abu Fatah told AFP.</p>

<p>"They attacked us with iron rods and sharp weapons. They torched my office. Then tried to break out and take all 600 prisoners with them," he said.</p>

<p>"We were forced to open fire. At least six inmates were killed including one who was stabbed to death."</p>

<p>Fatah said guards managed to quell the attack before anyone escaped.</p>

<p>On Tuesday another six prisoners were shot dead during a mass breakout at a high security prison in Kashimpur, just 30 kilometres (20 miles) north of Dhaka, warden Lutfor Rahman told AFP.</p>

<p>Rahman said the inmates used iron tools and rebar rods to attack guards and broke through the jail's main gate, forcing army soldiers and jail guards to open fire.</p>

<p>"At least 203 prisoners also managed to escape," he said.</p>

<p>Kashimpur High-Security Prison hosts some of Bangladesh's most notorious convicts, including Islamist extremists and murderers.</p>

<p>Rahman said none of the high-profile inmates had managed to break out of their cells.</p>

<p>Numerous attempted and successful jailbreaks have taken place across Bangladesh since protests against Hasina's government began last month.</p>

<p>More than 800 prisoners fled a jail in the central district of Narsingdi in July when a mob of thousands attacked the British colonial-era institution and set the warden's office on fire.</p>

<p>On Monday, the day of Hasina's ouster, more than 500 inmates fled a jail in the northern district of Sherpur.</p>

<p>More than 450 people died during weeks of clashes between police and protesters leading up to Hasina's ouster, including dozens of police officers.</p>

<p>Police unions declared a strike on Tuesday and said officers would not resume duty until their safety was assured.</p>

<p>More than half of the country's police stations have since reopened, according to the force.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A drone attack on Rohingya fleeing Myanmar killed many dozens of people, including families with children, several witnesses said, describing survivors wandering between piles of bodies to identify dead and injured relatives.</p>

<p>Four witnesses, activists and a diplomat described drone attacks on Monday that struck down families waiting to cross the border into neighbouring Bangladesh.</p>

<p>A heavily pregnant woman and her 2-year-old daughter were among the victims in the attack, the single deadliest known assault on civilians in Rakhine state during recent weeks of fighting between junta troops and rebels.</p>

<p>Three of the witnesses told Reuters on Friday that the Arakan Army was responsible, allegations the group denied. The militia and Myanmar's military blamed each other. Reuters could not verify how many people had died in the attack or independently determine responsibility.</p>

<p>Videos posted to social media showed piles of bodies strewn across muddy ground, their suitcases and backpacks scattered around them. Three survivors said more than 200 had died while a witness to the aftermath said he had seen at least 70 bodies.</p>

<p>Reuters verified the location of the videos as just outside the coastal Myanmar town of Maungdaw. Reuters was not able to independently confirm the date the videos were filmed.</p>

<p>One witness, 35-year-old Mohammed Eleyas, said his pregnant wife and 2-year-old daughter were wounded in the attack and later died. He was standing with them on the shoreline when drones began attacking the crowds, Eleyas told Reuters from a refugee camp in Bangladesh.</p>

<p>"I heard the deafening sound of shelling multiple times," he said. Eleyas said he lay on the ground to protect himself and when he got up, he saw his wife and daughter critically injured and many of his other relatives dead.</p>

<p>A second witness, Shamsuddin, 28, said he survived with his wife and newborn son. Also speaking from a refugee camp in Bangladesh, he said that after the attack many lay dead and "some people were shouting out from the pain of their injuries".</p>

<p>Boats carrying fleeing Rohingya, members of a mostly Muslim minority who face extreme persecution in Myanmar, also sank in the Naf River that separates the two countries on Monday, killing dozens more, according to two witnesses and Bangladesh media.</p>

<p>Medecins Sans Frontieres said in a statement the aid organisation had treated 39 people who had crossed from Myanmar into Bangladesh since Saturday for violence-related injuries, including mortar shell injuries and gunshot wounds. Patients described seeing people bombed while trying to find boats to cross the river, the statement said.</p>

<p>A spokesperson for the United Nations High Commission for Refugees said the agency was "aware of the deaths of refugees from the capsize of two boats in the Bay of Bengal" and it had heard reports of civilian deaths in Maungdaw but that it could not confirm the numbers or circumstances.</p>

<h3><strong>FIGHTING IN THE REGION</strong></h3>

<p>The Rohingya have been long persecuted in Buddhist-majority Myanmar. More than 730,000 of them fled the country in 2017 after a military-led crackdown that the U.N. said was carried out with genocidal intent.</p>

<p>Myanmar has been in turmoil since the military seized power from a democratically elected government in 2021, and mass protests evolved into widespread armed struggle.</p>

<p>Rohingya have been leaving Rakhine for weeks as the Arakan Army, one of many armed groups fighting, has made sweeping gains in the north, home to a large population of Muslims.</p>

<p>Reuters has previously reported that the militia burned down the largest Rohingya town in May, leaving Maungdaw, which is under siege by the rebels, as the last major Rohingya settlement aside from grim displacement camps further south. The group denied the allegations.</p>

<p>Activist groups condemned this week's attacks. A senior Western diplomat said he had confirmed the reports.</p>

<p>"These reports of hundreds of Rohingya killed at the Bangladesh/Myanmar border are, I'm sorry to say, accurate," Bob Rae, Canada's ambassador to the United Nations and a previous special envoy to Myanmar, posted on X on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Myanmar's junta blamed the Arakan Army in a post on its Telegram channel.</p>

<p>The militia denied responsibility. "According to our investigation, family members of terrorists tried to go to Bangladesh from Maungdaw and the junta dropped the bomb because they left without permission," Arakan Army spokesman Khine Thu Kha told Reuters, referring to Muslims who have joined Rohingya armed groups fighting against the Arakan Army.</p>

<h3><strong>TRYING TO GET TO SAFETY</strong></h3>

<p>Reuters was able to confirm the location of the videos seen on social media from the position and shape of the mountain and shoreline, which matched file and satellite imagery of the area.</p>

<p>The fencing featured in one of the videos also matched file imagery of the location. The location of the videos matched the area described by Shamsuddin.</p>

<p>Eleyas described how his wife and daughter died in the aftermath of the attack, and his desperate efforts to find a boat that would take them to Bangladesh.</p>

<p>Before his wife died, "We apologised to each other for any wrongs we may have done in our lives," he said.</p>

<p>Around midnight, he said, he finally found a small boat and managed to cross the border with it.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Moscow on Saturday launched a "counter-terror operation" in three border regions adjoining Ukraine to halt Kyiv's biggest cross-border offensive in the two-and-a-half-year conflict.</p>

<p>Ukrainian units stormed across the border into Russia's western Kursk region on Tuesday morning in a shock attack and have advanced several kilometres, according to independent analysts.</p>

<p>Russia has deployed additional troops and equipment, including tanks, rocket launchers and aviation units to stop the advancing troops.</p>

<p>Russia's national anti-terrorism committee said late Friday it was starting "counter-terror operations in the Belgorod, Bryansk and Kursk regions ... in order to ensure the safety of citizens and suppress the threat of terrorist acts being carried out by the enemy's sabotage groups."</p>

<p>Under Russian law, security forces and the military are given sweeping emergency powers during "counter-terror" operations.</p>

<p>Movement is restricted, vehicles can be seized, phone calls can be monitored, areas are declared no-go zones, checkpoints are introduced, and security is beefed up at key infrastructure sites.</p>

<p>The anti-terrorism committee said Ukraine had mounted an "unprecedented attempt to destabilise the situation in a number of regions of our country."</p>

<p>It called Ukraine's incursion a "terrorist attack" and said Kyiv's troops had wounded civilians and destroyed residential buildings.</p>

<p>Ukrainian leaders have remained tight-lipped on the operation, and the United States, Kyiv's closest ally, said it was not informed of the plans in advance.</p>

<p>But President Volodymyr Zelensky has appeared to tout his troops' early successes, saying earlier this week that Russia must "feel" the consequences of the full-scale offensive it has waged against Ukraine since February 2022.</p>

<p>Russia's defence ministry published footage on Saturday of tank crews firing on Ukrainian positions in the Kursk region, as well as an overnight air strike, after it said Friday it had deployed yet more units to the border region.</p>

<p>It also said it had downed 26 Ukrainian drones that tried to attack the region overnight.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Calling India as one of the "closest allies" and "invaluable partners", Maldives President Mohamed Muizzu on Saturday reaffirmed his administration's "full commitment" to strengthening the "historic and close connections" between the two neighbouring countries.</p>

<p>"India has always been one of the closest allies and invaluable partners, facilitating and providing aid whenever Maldives has needed it," Mr Muizzu acknowledged in External Affairs Minister (EAM) S Jaishankar's presence during a ceremony held at the President's Office to handover the completed water supply and sewerage facilities on 28 islands in the Maldives, funded by the Government of India's Line of Credit (LoC) facility through the Exim Bank of India.</p>

<p>In his remarks, Mr Muizzu highlighted that these projects are key milestones in the Maldives' bilateral relations with India and would provide significant economic benefits, boost the local economies, and together contribute to the nation's prosperity.</p>

<p>He also extended "deep gratitude" to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the Indian government, and the friendly people of India for their "generous and continued assistance" to the Maldives.</p>

<p>"The President also emphasised that the High Impact Community Development Projects under Indian Grant Assistance demonstrate both countries' close engagement in socioeconomic development. He went on to say that numerous revolutionary initiatives are now underway as part of this initiative, and that the plan is to accelerate their delivery to communities. He also expressed appreciation for the flexibility offered in restructuring the line of credit arrangement," the President's office said in a statement following the ceremony.</p>

<p>Mr Muizzu concluded his speech by emphasising that centuries of friendship, mutual respect, and a strong sense of kinship have nourished the relations between the Maldives and India.</p>

<p>"He further stated that Maldivians value the deep and historic ties with the Indian people and are committed to its preservation and enhancement," the statement mentioned.</p>

<p>During his meeting with Mr Jaishankar, the Maldives President also recalled his recent visit to India, to attend the swearing-in ceremony of Prime Minister Modi and expressed appreciation for the invitation and the opportunity to meet the Prime Minister as well as President Droupadi Murmu.</p>

<p>"Privileged to call on President Dr Mohamed Muizzu. Conveyed greetings of PM Narendra Modi. Committed to deepen India-Maldives ties for the benefit of our people and the region," Mr Jaishankar posted after his meeting with Mr Muizzu and the virtual inauguration of water and sanitation projects in 28 islands of Maldives.</p>

<p>Earlier, Mr Jaishankar held a bilateral meeting with Maldivian Defence Minister Mohamed Ghassan Maumoon to discuss enhanced security cooperation between the two countries.</p>

<p>The discussions focused on joint initiatives for maritime security and the shared goal of maintaining regional peace and stability.</p>

<p>He also participated in a symbolic tree-planting ceremony in Male's Lonuziyaaraiy Park along with Maldivian Foreign Minister Moosa Zameer and Thoriq Ibrahim, the Climate Change, Environment, and Energy Minister of the country.</p>

<p>On Friday, immediately after his arrival from India, a ceremony was held at the Maldives' Ministry of Foreign Affairs to mark the inauguration and handover of six projects implemented under the High Impact Community Development Projects facilitated under the Grant Assistance from India, as well as the exchange of a Memorandum of Understanding on the integrated payment system between the Ministry of Economic Development and Trade of Maldives, and the National Payments Corporation of India.</p>

<p>Additionally, an exchange notes for the renewal of the MoU to train 1,000 Civil Service Officers was exchanged between the Civil Service Commission of the Maldives and the High Commission of India.</p>

<p>"I conveyed our sincere appreciation to the people and Government of India for their generous assistance in advancing the lives of Maldivian communities. I also reiterated our commitment to continue working closely with the Government of India, bilaterally, regionally and multilaterally, to further strengthen and deepen the bonds between our two countries," said Minister of Foreign Affairs of Maldives Moosa Zameer.</p>

<p>Addressing the media, Mr Jaishankar highlighted the importance of the visit, his first to the strategically-significant Indian Ocean archipelago since January 2023.</p>

<p>"The Maldives is one of the cornerstones of our 'Neighborhood First' policy, it is also one of our Vision SAGAR, as well as of our commitment to the Global South. To put it succinctly in the words of my Prime Minister Narendra Modi, for India, neighbourhood is a priority, and in the neighbourhood, Maldives is a priority," he said.</p>

<p>He also underscored the common challenges faced by both nations and the importance of their defence and security cooperation.</p>

<p>"As neighbours, we face common challenges and have a shared interest in maintaining peace and security in the region. After all, we both have very big EEZs. Our defence and security cooperation is aimed at confronting many common challenges, and I look forward to fruitful discussions in that regard," he said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki, who was also one of the first Google employees, has died after a two-year battle with cancer. She was 56.</p>

<p>In a post on Facebook, Ms Wojcicki's husband Dennis Troper said that she was battling non-small cell lung cancer. "My beloved wife of 26 years and mother to our five children left us today after 2 years of living with non-small cell lung cancer. Susan was not just my best friend and partner in life, but a brilliant mind, a loving mother, and a dear friend to many," Troper wrote alongside a few family photographs.<br />
<br />
He noted that her impact on the family and the world was "immeasurable."&nbsp;<br />

<strong>Who was Susan Wojcicki?</strong><br />
<br />
1. Born on July 5, 1968, in Santa Clara, California, she was the daughter of Stanley, who taught physics at Stanford University. Her mother Esther worked as a journalist and teacher at the Palo Alto High School, Bloomberg reported.<br />
<br />
2. Ms Wojcicki studied history at Harvard University and later worked as a photojournalist in India. Within a few years, she returned to California to receive advanced degrees in economics and business. Later on, she took up a marketing role with Intel Corp.<br />
<br />
3. In 1998, when Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin incorporated the search engine into a business, Ms Wojcicki rented the garage of her home in Menlo Park, California, to them for $1,700 a month. After working there for a few months, they later moved Google into a more formal office.<br />
<br />
4. She was hired in 1999 as the 16th employee of Google and later went on to work towards everything from AdSense, Google Analytics and Google Books to Google Images. In 2006, the company bought her home to serve as a monument to its roots. At the same time, Brin became her brother-in-law and married her sister, Anne, in 2007. However, the former couple parted ways in 2015.<br />
<br />
5. Wojcicki had in 2006 advocated for the $1.65 billion acquisition of YouTube. Being its CEO, she went on to expand its viewership to 2.5 billion monthly users. In February 2023, Ms Wojcicki announced her decision to step down as YouTube's CEO after spending around nine years of being the front and centre of the company.<br />
<br />
From being one of the early employees of Google who helped jumpstart the company in her garage to running the tech giant's advertising business and then YouTube for most of the past decade, Wojcicki has had a journey of a lifetime. Ms Wojcicki married Dennis Troper, who was a fellow veteran Google manager, back in 1998. In February this year, one of their children -- son Marco -- passed away due to an accidental drug overdose at the age of 19.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[The ouster of Bangladesh's autocratic premier sparked celebrations in Dhaka this week but alarm in neighbouring India, which backed Sheikh Hasina to counter rival China and quash Islamist alternatives, analysts say.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The ouster of Bangladesh's autocratic premier sparked celebrations in Dhaka this week but alarm in India, which backed Sheikh Hasina to counter rival China and quash Islamist alternatives, analysts say.</p>

<p>It has created a diplomatic dilemma for the regional powerhouse.</p>

<p>Hasina, 76, quit as prime minister in the face of a student-led uprising on Monday and fled by helicopter to longtime ally New Delhi.</p>

<p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was among the first to offer his "best wishes" after Bangladesh's newly sworn-in interim leader Muhammad Yunus took power Thursday, saying New Delhi was "committed" to working with Dhaka.</p>

<p>But China was also swift to welcome Dhaka's new authorities, saying it "attaches importance to the development" of relations.</p>

<p>With Hasina's rivals in control in Dhaka, India's support for the old government has come back to bite.</p>

<p>"From the point of view of Bangladeshis, India has been on the wrong side for a couple of years now," said International Crisis Group analyst Thomas Kean.</p>

<p>"The Indian government absolutely did not want to see a change in Dhaka, and had made that very clear for years that they didn't see any alternative to Hasina and the Awami League."</p>

<h3><strong>&nbsp;'Detrimental'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Bangladesh is almost entirely encircled by India, with a deeply intertwined history long before they were partitioned out of the Indian subcontinent in 1947.</p>

<p>But while India's 1.4 billion population and dominating economy overshadows Bangladesh -- with a population of 170 million -- Hasina also courted China.</p>

<p>India and China, the world's two most populous nations, are intense rivals competing for strategic influence across South Asia, including in Nepal, Sri Lanka and the Maldives.</p>

<p>Hasina pursued a delicate balancing act, benefiting from support from New Delhi, while maintaining strong relations with Beijing.</p>

<p>New Delhi saw a common threat in groups Hasina viewed as rivals and crushed with brutal force, including the key Bangladesh National Party (BNP).</p>

<p>"India... worried that any alternative to Hasina and the Awami League could be detrimental to Indian interests," said Michael Kugelman, director of the South Asia Institute at the Washington-based Wilson Center.</p>

<p>"In New Delhi's view, the BNP and its allies are dangerous Islamist forces that could imperil Indian interests."</p>

<p>Yunus has said he wants elections in Bangladesh "within a few months".</p>

<p>The BNP could be poised for a comeback, holding a mass rally in Dhaka this week.</p>

<p>In the immediate aftermath of Hasina's fall, some businesses and homes owned by Hindus were attacked, a group seen by some in Muslim-majority Bangladesh as having been her supporters.</p>

<p>Hundreds of Bangladeshi Hindus this week arrived on India's border, asking to cross.</p>

<p>Hindu nationalist leader Modi on Thursday said he hoped "for an early return to normalcy, ensuring the safety and protection of Hindus and all other minority communities."</p>

<h3><strong>'She will go back'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>The fact Hasina is sheltering in India may prove to be a stumbling block to relations between New Delhi and Dhaka.</p>

<p>Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar told parliament Hasina had flown to India "at very short notice", and according to Indian media, intended to stay only briefly in transit.</p>

<p>But her reported bid to travel onwards to Britain was scuppered after London called for a "full and independent UN-led investigation" into the deadly crackdown on protests in the last weeks of her rule.</p>

<p>The United States in the past had praised Hasina's economic track record and saw her as a partner on priorities such as countering Islamist extremism, but Washington more recently imposed visa sanctions over concerns about democracy.</p>

<p>It is not clear how long she will now stay in India, or where else she might go.</p>

<p>Since arriving at a military airbase near New Delhi, she has been hosted in a secret safe house and not spoken publically.</p>

<p>Her daughter Saima Wazed said she was "heartbroken" she could not see her mother.</p>

<p>"As much as I would love to see Ma, I don't want to compromise her whereabouts in any way", Wazed, the World Health Organization's Southeast Asia chief, said in a since-deleted post on social media platform X.</p>

<p>Her son Sajeeb Wazed Joy told the Times of India newspaper his mother still hoped to contest for political office.</p>

<p>"She will go back to Bangladesh the moment the interim government decides to hold an election," he said.</p>

<h3><strong>'Earned the enmity'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Indian media warn of the "formidable diplomatic challenge" the country now faces.</p>

<p>"New Delhi must actively work to limit the damage, and ensure the high stakes in the relationship are protected," the Indian Express newspaper warned. "This could involve some near-term setbacks."</p>

<p>But Bangladesh's new leader Yunus has offered an olive branch.</p>

<p>"Although some countries, such as India, backed the ousted prime minister and earned the enmity of the Bangladeshi people as a result, there will be many opportunities to heal these kinds of rifts," Yunus wrote in The Economist, shortly before returning to Bangladesh.</p>

<p>Crisis Group's Kean meanwhile said he believes the nations will put the past aside for pragmatic relations.</p>

<p>"India is Bangladesh's most important international partner, and there's no reason that they can't find a way to move forward from this," said Kean.</p>

<p>"Economic forces will compel them to work together."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Late arrival for boarding helped a Brazilian man escape death as the flight he missed met a tragic end last evening.</p>

<p>Adriano Assis was to board the Voepass 2283 flight that crashed in Sao Paulo, killing all passengers and crew on board. In an interview with local news outlet TV Globo, Adriano said he was stopped from boarding the flight because he was late.</p>

<p>An excerpt from the interview was shared on X with the caption, "This man wasn't allowed to board the plane that just crashed in Vinhedo in Sao Paulo, Brazil because he was LATE. He argued with the man at the boarding gate but ended up hugging him after hearing the plane had crashed. This is unbelievable."</p>

<p>Adriano said the airline employee who stopped him from boarding the flight saved his life. He said a confusion over his flight details got him late for boarding. When the staff refused to let him on the flight, he "argued with him and so on, and that was it. And he saved my life."</p>

<p>According to the flight manifest, the aircraft was intended to carry 58 passengers. The 58th passenger to never make it onboard was Adriano Assis. He added that after finding out about the accident, he searched for the airline employee and hugged him.</p>

<p>"I hugged him because he's done his job. If he hadn't done his job, maybe I wouldn't be doing this interview today. I spoke out of anger, but this chap, I don't even know his name, he really saved my life," he said.</p>

<p>Several videos of the Voepass ATR 72 turboprop spinning out of control and slamming into a gated community in Vinhedo, some 80 km northwest of Sao Paulo, went viral on social media yesterday. All those who were on board -- 57 passengers and four crew members -- died. No deaths were reported on the ground, according to authorities.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Chief Justice of Bangladesh's top court, Obaidul Hassan, agreed to resign "in principle" following intense pressure from protesters surrounding the Supreme Court, broadcaster Jamuna TV reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The 65-year-old judge will tender his resignation after consulting President Mohammed Shahabuddin in the evening, The Dhaka Tribune newspaper reported.</p>

<p>The protests started after Mr Hassan called for a full court meeting with all justices from both divisions of the Supreme Court. The protesting students viewed the convening of the full court meeting as a judiciary coup and announced a siege of the High Court premises.</p>

<p>In the face of student protest, Chief Justice Hassan postponed the meeting and later said that he would step down.</p>

<p>Hassan, appointed last year and seen as a loyalist to ousted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina was given an one-hour ultimatum to resign.</p>

<p>Bangladesh Bank Governor Abdur Rouf Talukder has also resigned but his resignation has not been accepted given the importance of the position, finance ministry adviser Salehuddin Ahmed told reporters. Days earlier, four deputy governors were forced to resign by 300 to 400 bank officials accusing them of corruption.</p>

<p>The protests, part of the wider unrest that led to Hasina's departure, have resulted in over 450 deaths, including dozens of police officers. Hasina faces allegations of murder, forced disappearance, money laundering and corruption, and must face the law, Amir Khosru Mahmud Chowdhury, a senior member of Bangladesh Nationalist Party said.</p>

<p>The police union has declared a strike, refusing to return to work until their safety is assured, further complicating the situation.</p>

<p>Hasina has been sheltering in New Delhi since Monday and plans to return to the country and take part in elections.</p>

<p>Many homes and businesses of the country's minority Hindu community have also been vandalised this week, prompting hundreds of them in northwest Bangladesh to try and flee to neighbouring India.</p>

<p>Bangladesh's interim leader Muhammad Yunus appealed for religious unityas he embraced the weeping mother of a student shot dead by police, a flashpoint in mass protests that ended Sheikh Hasina's 15-year rule.</p>

<p>The Nobel laureate's first task is to bring stability to Bangladesh after he responded to a call by student protesters for him to temporarily lead the country following weeks of deadly anti-government demonstrations against the government led by Sheikh Hasina.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>OpenAI says it is concerned that a realistic voice feature for its artificial intelligence might cause people to bond with the bot at the cost of human interactions.</p>

<p>The San Francisco-based company cited literature which it said indicates that chatting with AI as one might with a person can result in misplaced trust and that the high quality of the GPT-4o voice may exacerbate that effect.</p>

<p>"Anthropomorphization involves attributing human-like behaviors and characteristics to nonhuman entities, such as AI models," OpenAI said Thursday in a report on safety work it is doing on a ChatGPT-4o version of its AI.</p>

<p>"This risk may be heightened by the audio capabilities of GPT-4o, which facilitate more human-like interactions with the model."</p>

<p>OpenAI said it noticed testers speaking to the AI in ways that hinted at shared bonds, such as lamenting aloud that it was their last day together.</p>

<p>It said these instances appear benign but must be studied to see how they might evolve over longer periods of time.</p>

<p>Socializing with AI could also make users less adept or inclined when it comes to relationships with humans, OpenAI speculated.</p>

<p>"Extended interaction with the model might influence social norms," the report said.</p>

<p>"For example, our models are deferential, allowing users to interrupt and 'take the mic' at any time, which, while expected for an AI, would be anti-normative in human interactions."</p>

<p>The ability for AI to remember details while conversing and to tend to tasks could also make people over-reliant on the technology, according to OpenAI.</p>

<p>"The recent concerns shared by OpenAI around potential dependence on ChatGPT's voice mode indicate what many have already begun asking: Is it time to pause and consider how this technology affects human interaction and relationships?" said Alon Yamin, co-founder and CEO of AI anti-plagiarism detection platform Copyleaks.</p>

<p>He said AI should never be a replacement for actual human interaction.</p>

<p>OpenAI said it will further test how voice capabilities in its AI might cause people to become emotionally attached.</p>

<p>Teams testing ChatGPT-4o voice capabilities were also able to prompt it to repeat false information and produce conspiracy theories, raising concerns the AI model could be told to do so convincingly.</p>

<p>OpenAI was forced to apologize to actress Scarlett Johansson in June for using something very similar to her voice in its latest chatbot, throwing a spotlight on voice-cloning tech.</p>

<p>Although OpenAI denied the voice they used was Johansson's, their case was not helped by CEO Sam Altman flagging the new model with a one-word message on social media -- "Her".</p>

<p>Johansson voiced an AI character in the film "Her", which Altman has previously said is his favorite film about technology.</p>

<p>The 2013 film stars Joaquin Phoenix as a man who falls in love with an AI assistant named Samantha.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Susan Wojcicki, once a key figure in Google's history, died after a two-year battle with cancer, Alphabet and Google CEO Sundar Pichai informed on Saturday.</p>

<p>Wojcicki played a foundational role in shaping YouTube's trajectory.</p>

<p>“Unbelievably saddened by the loss of my dear friend @SusanWojcicki after two years of living with cancer. She is as core to the history of Google as anyone, and it's hard to imagine the world without her,” Mr Pichai posted on X social media platform.</p>

<p>Mr Pichai said she was an incredible person, leader and friend who had a tremendous impact on the world.</p>

<p>“I am one of countless Googlers who is better for knowing her. We will miss her dearly. Our thoughts with her family. RIP Susan,” the Google CEO posted.</p>

<p>She was one of Google's earliest employees and had received a 'Google Founders Award' for making AdSense, which helped tremendously in Google's advertising.</p>

<p>Her tenure as CEO of YouTube saw the platform's growth into a global powerhouse, impacting millions of content creators and billions of viewers.</p>

<p>Wojcicki's legacy is not only in the products sector she helped develop but also in her advocacy for women in tech, making her a role model for aspiring leaders worldwide.</p>

<p>Indian-American Neal Mohan was appointed the new YouTube CEO after Wojcicki in February 2023 announced to step down after 25 years at the Google-owned company.</p>

<p>Wojcicki managed marketing, co-created Google Image Search, led Google's first Video and Book search, as well as early parts of AdSense's creation, worked on the YouTube and DoubleClick acquisitions and served as SVP of Ads.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Simone Biles and MyKayla Skinner, the two teammates during the 2016 Rio and the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, have been embroiled in a major feud recently. It all started after Skinner questioned the work ethic and dedication of the US Olympic squad for the 2024 Paris Olympics.</p>

<p>The two former teammates have been at daggers drawn after Skinner targeted the four members of Team USA at the ongoing games: Suni Lee, Jordan Chiles, Jade Carey and Hezly Rivera.<br />
<br />
<b>MyKayla Skinner criticises Team USA</b><br />
<br />
Skinner made negative comments about Team USA after its Olympic qualifiers in June earlier this year. In a July 3 video, she stated that she felt the team didn't work as hard as previous gymnasts.</p>

<p>"Besides Simone, I feel like the talent and the depth just isn't like what it used to be," Skinner said in the video posted on YouTube. While the video was soon deleted, it has since captured major attention on social media platform X.</p>

<p>She added, "I just notice like, I mean, obviously a lot of girls don't work as hard. The girls just don't have the work ethic."</p>

<p>Skinner further blamed SafeSport, the independent organisation working towards increasing safety and preventing athlete abuse.</p>

<p><b>Skinner apologises for negative comments</b></p>

<p>Many from the gymnastics world, including Biles, heavily criticised Skinner for her remarks. Biles seemingly addressed her on Instagram Threads and wrote, “Not everyone needs a mic and a platform.”</p>

<p>Amid criticism, Skinner shared an apology video on her Instagram Stories and claimed her comments were “misinterpreted.”</p>

<p>She further explained a lot of things she said were not "always necessarily about the current team because I love and support all the girls that made it and I'm so proud of them."</p>

<p>"It was more about going back into my own gym, just the work ethic is different compared to when we were doing gymnastics in the Márta era," she said, adding that she was "not sticking up for Márta or saying what she did was good, I'm just saying it was different."</p>

<p>In conclusion, she apologised to the current team and said she was “seriously so happy for them”.</p>

<p>In a statement to People magazine last month, she said, "Upon reflection I was comparing the 'Marta Era' to the current era. I am coming to terms that I have not fully dealt with the emotional and verbal abuse I endured under Marta that perhaps led to my hurtful comments. I take full responsibility for what I said and I deeply apologise."</p>

<p><b>Biles takes a jibe at Skinner</b></p>

<p>Soon after Team USA won the gold medal in the team all-around competition at the 2024 Paris Olympics, Biles shared photographs of herself with other teammates and wrote, "lack of talent, lazy, olympic champions".</p>

<p>As the post went viral, the comments section was soon flooded with support.</p>

<p>'Heartbroken' Skinner blocks Biles</p>

<p>A day after the post by Biles, she revealed that Skinner had blocked her on Instagram.</p>

<p>"Pop I've been blocked," she wrote while sharing a few emojis.</p>

<p>Nearly a week later, Skinner returned to the social media platform and posted a 4-minute-long video, making a direct request to Biles to ask her followers to avoid attacking Skinner and her family -- including her infant daughter Charlotte.</p>

<p>"Only Simone had responded and she told me that she was proud of me," Skinner said, adding that if Biles "truly believes" that she thinks the team is "lazy and lacking talent," then she was "really heartbroken over it."</p>

<p>She further claimed that Biles' post "fueled another wave of hateful comments," that led towards death threats to her and her family.</p>

<p>"To Simone, I am asking you directly and publicly to please put a stop to this... Please ask your followers to stop," Skinner said.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Chief Justice of Bangladesh, Obaidul Hassan, resigned today following massive protests by students who surrounded the Supreme Court. Mr Hassan agreed to resign "in principle" after an ultimatum to do so from protesters. He was appointed to helm the Supreme Court last year and is seen as a loyalist to ousted premier Sheikh Hasina.</p>

<p>Hundreds of protesters, largely comprising students, surrounded the Bangladesh Supreme Court, demanding the immediate resignation of Chief Justice. The situation escalated rapidly, with reports suggesting the Chief Justice fled the premises before announcing his resignation.</p>

<p>The <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/bangladesh-chief-justice-says-will-resign-after-massive-student-protests-6306355">Bangladesh protests</a> were sparked by a full-court meeting called by the Chief Justice without consulting the newly formed interim government. Student protestors alleged that the judges of the court are part of a conspiracy, prompting outrage and demands for accountability.</p>

<p>As tensions mounted, the scheduled full-court meeting was abruptly called off. Protestors, undeterred, continued to besiege the Supreme Court, giving the Chief Justice a one-hour ultimatum to step down.</p>

<p>The fresh protests come days after a student-led uprising against government hiring rules resulted in Nobel peace prize winner Muhammad Yunus taking charge of a caretaker government.</p>

<p>At least 450 people were killed in more than a month of deadly protests that ended the autocratic rule of 76-year-old prime minister Sheikh Hasina.</p>

<p>Hasina faces allegations of murder, forced disappearance, money laundering and corruption, and must face the law, Amir Khosru Mahmud Chowdhury, a senior member of Bangladesh Nationalist Party said.</p>

<p>Hasina, one of Asia's longest-serving leaders, resigned and fled Bangladesh on August 5 under pressure from millions of protesters who had taken to the streets for weeks to demand she step down.</p>

<p>An interim government was appointed in Bangladesh Thursday, led by Nobel Prize-winning economist Muhammad Yunus. Under the constitution, an election needs to be called within 90 days, although Yunus, the military - which backs the interim government - and the president haven't commented on when elections will be held.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fugitive Catalan separatist leader Carles Puigdemont said Friday he had left Spain for Belgium after briefly addressing supporters in Barcelona, sparking a row over how he evaded arrest again.</p>

<p>"Today I am in Waterloo after an extremely difficult few days," he wrote in Catalan on X, formerly Twitter, referring to the Belgian town where he has spent most of the past seven years.</p>

<p>Puigdemont, who fled abroad after leading a failed 2017 independence bid for Catalonia, defied an arrest warrant to return to Spain on Thursday.</p>

<p>He delivered a speech to thousands gathered at the Catalan regional parliament in Barcelona before slipping away.</p>

<p>The 61-year-old had been expected to try to enter the parliament building for a vote to pick a new leader for the wealthy northeastern region. Instead, he disappeared into the crowd.</p>

<p>His lawyer, Gonzalo Boye, and the secretary general of Puigdemont's hardline separatist JxCAT party, Josep Turull, had both told Catalan radio earlier Friday that he had headed back to Belgium.</p>

<p>But Eduard Sallent, head of Catalonia's regional police, the Mossos d'Esquadra, said Friday he had not ruled out that Puigdemont might still be in Barcelona.</p>

<h3><strong>Police manhunt&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Catalonia's regional police launched a manhunt for Puigdemont after Thursday's appearance, insisting in a statement issued after he evaded them that there had been no collusion with him.</p>

<p>Officers had planned to arrest him "at the most opportune time so as not to generate public disorder", the force said.</p>

<p>Two officers were arrested on Thursday, including one who owned the car he had used to leave the scene. Released after a few hours, they are still accused of having helped Puigdemont.</p>

<p>The force told AFP on Friday that a third officer had now been arrested over the incident.</p>

<p>Supreme Court judge Pablo Llarena, who issued the arrest warrant for Puigdemont, on Friday demanded the names of the officers who approved the operation to arrest Puigdemont.</p>

<p>He also wanted the names of those "entrusted with its execution or operational deployment", according to a court document.</p>

<p>Sallent said his force had been ready to arrest Puigdemont near the regional parliament, but he did not go there as had been expected.</p>

<p>"The events unfolded very quickly," he said, adding Puigdemont was "surrounded by a crowd of people and authorities" with the "aim of obstructing the action of the police".</p>

<p>Puigdemont led the regional government in 2017 when it carried out an independence referendum despite a court ban.</p>

<p>A short-lived declaration of independence sparked Spain's worst political crisis since the country returned to democracy following the death of dictator Francisco Franco in 1975.</p>

<p>Puigdemont fled Spain shortly after the failed independence bid to avoid prosecution and has since lived in Belgium and more recently France.</p>

<p>While Spain's parliament passed an amnesty law in May for those involved in the secession bid, the Supreme Court ruled on July 1 that the measure would not fully apply to Puigdemont.</p>

<h3><strong>'Unspeakable'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Puigdemont's latest escape has brought political recriminations,</p>

<p>The head of Spain's main opposition Popular Party, Alberto Nunez Feijoo, said the interior and defence ministers should be dismissed for the "police negligence" that allowed Puigdemont to evade arrest.</p>

<p>"What happened yesterday is unspeakable and cannot go unpunished," he wrote on social network X.</p>

<p>But Justice Minister Felix Bolanos said the operation to arrest Puigdemont "was the responsibility of the Mossos", whose job it was to enforce court orders in Catalonia.</p>

<p>"In Spain the law must be respected and court orders must be complied with," the minister said.</p>

<p>Catalonia's parliament on Thursday elected Salvador Illa of Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez's Socialists as Catalonia's first head not from the pro-independence movement since 2010.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Malkinson, who spent 17 years wrongfully imprisoned, will see a deduction of 100,000 pounds (Rs 1,06,88,639) from his compensation.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The British government has informed victims of historic miscarriages of justice-theoretically, including Andrew Malkinson-that they will now have to meet "bed and board" costs for the period spent in prison, according to the <em>BBC</em>. According to the decision, compensation payments made to those wrongfully jailed will be reduced by these expenses.</p>

<p>One of these victims is Andrew Malkinson, who spent 17 years in prison for the false conviction of raping a woman in Salford, Greater Manchester, in 2003. He will see deductions of 100,000 pounds (Rs 1,06,88639) from his compensation to pay for these costs, despite having since been cleared, according to the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy31pk1w0lo"><em>news outlet</em></a>. It was revealed that former Justice Secretary Alex Chalk axed the previous policy, which allowed such deductions, last year. However, the new ruling reverses this change, placing a financial burden on individuals who have already suffered significant injustices.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/uk-man-comes-out-17-years-after-wrong-rape-conviction-kidnapped-by-state-4248062"><strong>Also Read | UK Man Comes Out 17 Years After Wrong Rape Conviction: "Kidnapped By State"</strong></a></p>

<p>According to <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy31pk1w0lo">the BBC</a>,</em> Mr Malkinson, whose case sparked the policy change, served nearly two decades in prison for a rape he did not commit and was formally cleared by the Court of Appeal last July.</p>

<p>He has called for an overhaul of the jury and appeals system to give wrongly convicted people more protection. Mr Malkinson said that even with the living costs rule removed, he expected to wait two years for any compensation while the independent board, which determined how much he was entitled to, made its decision.</p>

<p>Calling for the system to be speeded up and requirements to be simplified, he said: "It's a silly barrier that's been artificially erected. It's inexcusable. It's not justified."</p>

<p>A House of Commons library document from 2015 describes compensation as "the exception rather than the rule" in miscarriage of justice cases.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ahead of the crucial US presidential elections on November 5 this year, "The Mandate for Leadership 2025: The Conservative Promise," a policy wishlist by the 2025 Presidential Transition Project or simply called 'Project 2025' is making waves in the country.<br />
<br />
"The project is the effort of a broad coalition of conservative organisations that have come together to ensure a successful administration begins in January 2025," according to its official website.<br />
<br />
Since 1980, The Heritage Foundation has published a book of policy recommendations for the next Republican administration, The Washington Post stated.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
For this election cycle, it has convened a coalition of over 100 right-wing groups, presenting its controversial proposals as a movement consensus under the banner of 'Project 2025'. According to reports, this coalition involved at least 140 Trump administration alumni.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The 900-page policy book was published in April last year, proposing a total overhaul of the executive branch.<br />
<br />
<b>Project 2025 makes the following suggestions&nbsp;</b><br />
<br />
It's asking for securing the border, finishing the wall, and deportation of "illegal aliens".<br />
<br />
It calls for de-weaponising the Federal Government via more accountability and "oversight of the FBI and DOJ".<br />
<br />
Unleash American energy production to reduce energy prices.<br />
<br />
To reduce inflation, Project 2025 suggests cutting the growth of government spending.<br />
<br />
Make federal bureaucrats more accountable to the democratically elected President and Congress.<br />
<br />
Improve education by moving control and funding of education from DC bureaucrats directly to parents and state and local governments.<br />
<br />
Project 2025 also suggests banning "biological males from competing in women's sports".<br />
<br />
<b>Is Project 2025 linked to Donald Trump?</b><br />
<br />
Donald Trump shared a private flight with the head of the organisation behind Project 2025 in April 2022 and was said to have been briefed on the controversial policy agenda, The <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/2024/08/07/trump-heritage-project-2025-roberts/">Washington Post</a> reported.<br />
<br />
While Trump has on multiple occasions denied knowing about its policy blueprint or even those behind it, the former US president shared the 45-minute private flight with Heritage Foundation president Kevin Roberts, people familiar with the trip told the leading US daily.<br />
<br />
Together, Trump and Roberts flew from the former US president's home in Palm Beach, Florida to the foundation's annual conference on Amelia Island, where the 78-year-old delivered a keynote address that pointed out Heritage's forthcoming policy proposals, the report stated.<br />
<br />
Back then, the organisation was in the early stages of organising Project 2025. During the flight, Roberts brought up the matter with Trump, but he seemed uninterested and moved on to a different subject, a Heritage official said.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
However, an official of the Trump campaign stated that he didn't discuss Project 2025 on the plane with Roberts, who took over day-to-day management of the controversial agenda recently after the departure of director Paul Dans.<br />
<br />
In July this year, Trump decried it on his Truth Social platform and said that he had “nothing to do with them”. Further, he called some of its projected ideas “absolutely ridiculous and abysmal”.<br />
<br />
Trump campaign spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said, "Project 2025 has never and will never be an accurate reflection of President Trump's policies”.<br />
<br />
Leavitt noted that Trump's 20 promises to the forgotten men and women and the RNC platform are "the only policies endorsed by President Trump for a second term."<br />
<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United States is pushing back its planned return to the Moon from 2026 to "mid-2027" as it deals with heat shield issues and other troubles plaguing its Orion crew capsule, NASA officials said Thursday.</p>

<p>The announcement comes as President-elect Donald Trump is preparing to take office in January and could significantly reshape the direction of the US space agency.</p>

<p>Artemis, named after the sister of Apollo in Greek mythology, was officially announced in 2017 as part of NASA's plans to establish a sustained presence on Earth's nearest space neighbor, and apply lessons learned there for a future mission to Mars.</p>

<p>Its first mission, an uncrewed test flight to the Moon and back called Artemis 1, took place in 2022, after several postponements.</p>

<p>But teams reviewing the data later learned that Orion's heat shield eroded in unexpected ways, and there were also issues with its electrical and life support systems.</p>

<p>"We were able to recreate the problem here on Earth, and now we know the root cause, and this has allowed us to devise a path forward," NASA administrator Bill Nelson told reporters during a press conference.</p>

<p>Artemis 2, involving a crew that will not land on the lunar surface, has been postponed from September 2025 to April 2026, Nelson told reporters.</p>

<p>Artemis 3, in which the first woman and first person of color are to set foot on lunar soil at the Moon's south pole, should now take place in "mid 2027."</p>

<p>"That will be well ahead of the Chinese government's announced intention that they have already publicly stated of 2030," added Nelson.</p>

<p>"The safety of our astronauts is always first in our decisions. It is our North Star. We do not fly until we are ready."</p>

<p>Apart from the troubles plaguing Orion, NASA is waiting for Elon Musk's SpaceX to have a modified version of its Starship prototype rocket to act as a lunar lander.</p>

<p>While the company is making rapid progress, it still has a long way to go in its testing, especially in proving it can carry out a complex refueling procedure in orbit.</p>

<p>The spacesuits, developed by Axiom, are also still awaited.</p>

<p>Trump on Wednesday nominated online payments billionaire and private astronaut Jared Isaacman to lead NASA.</p>

<p>Experts anticipate significant changes could be in the offing -- from potentially cancelling the expensive Space Launch Systems (SLS) rocket used for Artemis, to possibly scrapping the Moon component altogether, and focusing on Mars.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>French President Emmanuel Macron Thursday vowed to name a new prime minister "in the coming days" after the resignation of Michel Barnier, whose government was toppled by a no-confidence vote in parliament.</p>

<p>In an address to the nation, Macron rejected calls from opponents to resign, saying he would remain president "fully" until the end of the mandate in 2027.</p>

<p>He also lashed out at the French far right and hard left for uniting in an "anti-republican front" to bring down the government.</p>

<p>"I will appoint a prime minister in the coming days," he said, adding this person would be charged with forming a "government of general interest" with a priority of passing a budget.</p>

<p>Defiantly rejecting resignation calls, he added: "The mandate that you gave to me democratically (in 2022 elections) is a five-year mandate and I will exercise it fully, right up to the end."</p>

<p>He said the far-right National Rally (RN) of Marine Le Pen had its eyes on the 2027 presidential elections, accusing the party of seeking to sow "chaos".</p>

<p>"They are not thinking about your lives, let's be honest. They are thinking of just one thing -- the presidential election," said Macron, who must step down at the end of his term.</p>

<p>But he admitted his decision to call snap parliamentary elections this summer, which resulted in a hung parliament, "was not understood".</p>

<p>"Many have blamed me for it and I know, many continue to blame me. It's a fact and it's my responsibility," he said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A powerful earthquake struck Thursday off the coast of California, sparking a tsunami warning, US seismologists said.</p>

<p>The 7.0-magnitude quake was recorded at a depth of just 10 kilometers (six miles),&nbsp; almost 100 kilometers west-southwest of Ferndale, according to the United States Geological Survey.</p>

<p>"Based on preliminary earthquake parameters... hazardous tsunami are possible for coasts located within 300 KM of the earthquake epicenter," said a warning issued by the National Weather Service's Tsunami Warning Center in Honolulu.</p>

<p>The warning noted that no areas had yet experienced any waves, but that anyone near a coastline should be alert to the possibility of danger.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>India slammed developed countries for causing the climate crisis during a landmark hearing at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) on Thursday, saying they exploited the global carbon budget, failed to honour climate-finance promises and are now demanding that developing countries restrict their resource use.</p>

<p>The court is examining what legal obligations countries have to address climate change and the consequences if they fail.</p>

<p>Making submissions on behalf of India, Luther M Rangreji, joint secretary in the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA), said, "If the contribution to degradation is unequal, the responsibility must also be unequal."</p>

<p>India said developing nations are the hardest hit by climate change, despite contributing the least to it.</p>

<p>"The developed world, which historically contributed the most, is ironically the best equipped with the technological and economic means to address this challenge," Rangreji said.</p>

<p>He criticised rich countries for enjoying the benefits of fossil fuels while discouraging developing nations from using their own energy resources.</p>

<p>"Countries which have reaped development benefits from exploiting fossil fuels demand developing countries to not utilise the national energy resources available to them," he said.</p>

<p>India also slammed the lack of action on climate-finance commitments.</p>

<p>"The USD 100 billion pledged at the Copenhagen COP in 2009 by developed country parties and the doubling of the contribution to the Adaptation Fund have not yet been translated into any concrete actions," India noted.</p>

<p>It called the new climate finance package for the Global South agreed at COP29 in Azerbaijan's Baku "too little, too distant" to meet the urgent needs of developing countries.</p>

<p>India stressed the principle of fairness, saying, "If the contribution to global environmental degradation is unequal, the responsibility should also be unequal."</p>

<p>India also reaffirmed its commitment to its climate targets under the Paris Agreement, but warned against overburdening its citizens.</p>

<p>"There is a limit on how much we burden our citizens, even when India is pursuing Sustainable Development Goals for one-sixth of humanity," it said.</p>

<p>The hearing is the result of years of campaigning by Pacific island nations and Vanuatu, which led to a UN resolution asking the ICJ for an advisory opinion. Over the next two weeks, 98 countries, including small island nations and large emitters, will present their views.</p>

<p>Though non-binding, the ICJ's opinion could set a moral and legal benchmark in the global fight against climate change.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A congressional cap of 65,000 H-1B visas for regular applicants and an additional 20,000 visas for US advanced degree holders have been mandated by the US government.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It has been announced by the US Citizenship and Immigration Services or USCIS that they have received enough petitions to meet the cap for H-1B visas.</p>

<p>So, can more people apply or will they be rejected?</p>

<p>A congressional cap of 65,000 H-1B visas for regular applicants and an additional 20,000 visas for US advanced degree holders have been mandated by the US government.</p>

<p>The agency has informed that it will send out non-selection notices to registered candidates through their online accounts. The status later will read, "Not Selected: Not selected - not eligible to file an H-1B cap petition based on this registration" once the notifications are complete.</p>

<p>The H-1B cap lottery comes into the picture after the applications exceed the annual cap set by the US government. After that, a lottery system is used to process the petitions.</p>

<p>The deadline for submitting H-1B cap petitions was June 30 2024 but since the date fell on a Sunday, properly registered petitions received on July 1, 2024 would also be considered on time.</p>

<p>However, USCIS will continue to accept and process petitions that have been exempted from the cap.</p>

<p>"We will continue to accept and process petitions filed to extend the amount of time a current H-1B worker may remain in the United States; change the terms of employment for current H-1B workers; allow current H-1B workers to change employers; and allow current H-1B workers to work concurrently in additional H-1B positions," the USCIS said.</p>

<p>The visa lottery is a complex process and should be followed through with detail. It is advisable to keep track of the notifications sent by USCIS and not miss important deadlines or information.</p>

<p>Usually the majority of H-1B visa holders are Indians (72.3% of the total 386,000 H-1B visas issued), however USCIS data shows a decline in sponsorships across major firms such as Google, Amazon, Infosys and IBM.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[Indian space agency ISRO today successfully launched the European Space Agency's PROBA-3 satellite. The launch was on board ISRO's workhorse rocket - the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle or PSLV in its 61st commercial mission 'C-59'.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<ol class="CetSht_ol">
	<li class="CetSht_li">PROBA, short for Project for Onboard Anatomy, is a space programme under the European Space Agency or ESA. Under PROBA, there have been a series of satellite launches. Today's was the third in that series, hence the name PROBA-3.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">PROBA-3 is a solar mission. It's aim is to study the Sun's corona at a level of precision never done before. PROBA-3 consists of two independent, three-axis stabilised spacecraft - the Coronagraph Spacecraft or CSC, which is 310 kg and the Occulter Spacecraft or OSC, which is 240 kg. Both spacecraft will have a highly elliptical orbit around Earth whose apogee or distance farthest from the surface of the planet at the equator will be 60,500 km.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">According to the European Space Agency, the mission will demonstrate 'formation flying' within the context of a large-scale scientific experiment. The two spacecraft in orbit will create an approximately 150-metre-long solar coronagraph to study the Sun's faint corona closer to the solar rim than has ever been achieved before.&nbsp;</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">By flying in such a close formation - 150 metres - the Occulter Spacecraft will cast a precise shadow onto the Coronagraph's telescope, thereby blocking any direct sunlight. The Coronagraph will then be able to map and image the Sun's corona in the full electromagnetic spectrum - which includes visible light, Ultraviolet radiation (UV rays) and Infra-Red radiation (IR). It will also be able to image the solar corona in polarised light - which is made up of waves that vibrate in a single plane and include linearly, circularly, and elliptically polarised lights. The CSC will be able to do this for many hours at a time.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">The scientific objective of the PROBA-3 mission is to observe the Sun's corona at 1.1 solar radius in the visible wavelength range (visible light). Solar radius is a unit of distance used to describe the size of stars in comparison to the size of the Sun. 1 solar radius equals 6.95700 x 10(to the power 8) meters or 695,700 km. This is roughly 109 times the radius of the Earth. This would make PROBA-3 the most precise satellite to map and image the Sun's corona.&nbsp;</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">PROBA-3 marks the next step in formation flying. As a world first, its two satellites - the Coronagraph spacecraft and the Occulter spacecraft - will maintain formation to a few millimetres and arc second precision at distances of around 150 metres of each other for six hours at a time per 19-hour, 36-minute orbit. In effect the pair will be forming a virtual giant satellite. And this will be achieved autonomously, without relying on guidance from the ground.&nbsp;</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Now that the two satellites have been successfully placed in orbit, there will be a short preparatory period for the two satellites in which some safety tests will be conducted by the European Space Agency. Because these two satellites will be independent yet flying in tandem in close proximity, a collision manoeuvre test will be conducted. Once these tests are complete, the two satellites will be placed into into a safe relative tandem orbit. They can then be left safely in with no risk of collision or running away from each other.&nbsp;</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">The PROBA-3 satellites will repetitively demonstrate acquisition, rendezvous, proximity operations, formation flying, coronagraph observations, separation and convoy flying in every orbit.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">According to the Europan Space Agency, the PROBA-3 will be a "Laboratory in space" to validate strategies, guidance, navigation and control, and other algorithms, such as relative GPS navigation, previously tried in ground simulators.&nbsp;</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">The ESA said that this mission includes a rendezvous experiment. It will test sensors and algorithms for satellites to Rendezvous (cooperative and uncooperative) in elliptical orbit. This cutting-edge technology could be used for a future Mars Sample return mission and for de-orbiting satellites from low-Earth orbit - which will also help declutter the Space around Earth.</li>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Scientists have revealed the face of Saint Nicholas of Myra, the real-life bishop who inspired the concept of modern-day Santa Claus. According to the <em>New York Post</em>, the groundbreaking reconstruction comes 1,700 years after the saint's death and was possible by analysing data from his skull. Using advanced techniques, researchers managed to "forensically recreate" the face of Saint Nicholas of Myra, whose penchant for gift-giving prompted the legend of Father Christmas.</p>

<p>In the images, shared on Instagram by the study's lead author, Cicero Moraes, the saint is depicted with a broad forehead, thin lips and a round nose. The 3D images reveal his face to be both "strong" and "gentle," Mr Moraes said, per the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/04/world-news/real-face-of-santa-claus-revealed-thanks-to-science/" rel="noindex,nofollow">outlet</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Saint Nicholas of Myra died in 343 AD - long before anyone could snap a photo. He was known for only rewarding well-behaved kids with gifts and inspiring the Dutch folk figure of Sinterklaas. Over time, the character merged with English Father Christmas to become the Santa Claus we know today.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Despite the saint's popularity, there was no accurate depiction of his until now. Mr Moraes said the 3D images match the early descriptions of Santa Claus in literature, such as the 1823 poem "Twas The Night Before Christmas," which describes his "rosy cheeks," a "broad face" and a "nose like a cherry."</p>

<p>"The skull has a very robust appearance, generating a strong face, as its dimensions on the horizontal axis are larger than average," he said. "This characteristic, combined with a thick beard, is very reminiscent of the figure we have in mind when we think of Santa Claus," he added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to the <em>Post</em>, scientists used the data collected by Luigi Martino in 1950 to reconstruct the saint's face. Studying his remains revealed that the saint suffered from chronic arthritis in his spine and pelvis and a thick skull that likely caused frequent headaches. The scientists said the saint also likely survived off a mostly plant-based diet.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We initially reconstructed the skull in 3D using this data," Mr Moraes said. "We supplemented this with the anatomical deformation technique, in which the tomography of a living person's head is adjusted so that the virtual donor's skull matches that of the saint," he explained.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The final face is an interpolation of all this information, seeking anatomical and statistical coherence," Mr Moraes added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Notably, while Saint Nicholas was initially buried in Myra, or modern-day Turkey, his bones were later moved to Bari, Italy, where they remain today.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To prevent the recurrence of military standoffs along their contested border, India and China on Thursday reflected on the lessons learnt from the eastern Ladakh face-off that ended a few weeks ago following completion of the disengagement process in Depsang and Demchok.</p>

<p>In talks held in Delhi under the framework of the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination on India-China Border Affairs (WMCC), the two sides also prepared for the next meeting of the Special Representatives on the boundary question.</p>

<p>It was the first WMCC dialogue after the completion of the disengagement process in eastern Ladakh that effectively ended the standoff which had begun in May 2020.</p>

<p>"The two sides positively affirmed the implementation of the most recent disengagement agreement which completed the resolution of the issues that emerged in 2020," the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said.</p>

<p>"They also prepared for the next meeting of the Special Representatives (SR)," it said.</p>

<p>A decision on the resumption of dialogue under the SR mechanism was taken at a meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping in Kazan on the sidelines of the BRICS summit on October 21.</p>

<p>"Both sides reviewed the situation in border areas, and reflected on the lessons learnt from the events of 2020 in order to prevent their recurrence," the MEA said on the WMCC talks.</p>

<p>"In this context, they highlighted the importance of regular exchanges and contacts at diplomatic and military level through established mechanisms," it said.</p>

<p>"They agreed on the need for effective border management and maintenance of peace and tranquillity in accordance with relevant bilateral agreements, protocols and understandings reached between the two governments," it added.</p>

<p>The leader of the Chinese delegation also called on Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[FBI urged citizens to use encryption to secure their communications amid a massive Chinese cyberattack.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The FBI has issued a warning highlighting cybersecurity risks associated with texting between Android and Apple devices. This vulnerability stems from differences in how these platforms handle communication protocols, making texts susceptible to interception.&nbsp;When sending texts between iPhones and Android devices, messages are not protected by end-to-end encryption, leaving them vulnerable to hacking.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Apple's iMessage between iPhone users, and Google Messages between Android users, also employ end-to-end encryption using Signal's protocol. However, the texts exchanged between iPhone and Android devices are not fully encrypted, leaving them vulnerable.</p>

<p>According to <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/chinese-hackers-stole-americans-phone-data-8-telecoms-us-officials-say-rcna182942">NBC News</a></em>, a group of malicious actors, known as "Salt Typhoon" and believed to be based in China, recently infiltrated major US telecommunications companies, including AT&amp;T, T-Mobile, and Verizon, to spy on customers.&nbsp;Deputy National Security Adviser Anne Neuberger revealed that the cyberattack's impact extends far beyond the US, affecting "dozens of countries around the world."</p>

<p>A senior official further revealed that the hackers had accessed a substantial amount of phone data belonging to American citizens. The primary objective of this breach was to identify potential targets for more sophisticated and invasive spying.</p>

<h3><strong>Here's what to do:</strong></h3>

<p>To enhance security, the FBI recommends using encrypted messaging platforms like Signal or WhatsApp, which provide end-to-end encryption, ensuring messages remain private. Notably, encryption is a technology that scrambles a message and requires a "key" to be able to see or hear it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>End-to-end encryption ensures that only the sender and recipient of a message hold the unique decryption key. This means that even the app's corporate owner and operator cannot access the encrypted message, even if compelled by a court order or in the event of a hack.</p>

<p>Google Messages and iMessage also offer end-to-end encryption, but only for messages sent between devices of the same operating system. Additionally, users are advised to avoid relying on default SMS or MMS services, as these lack adequate protection against interception.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Our suggestion, what we have told folks internally, is not new here: Encryption is your friend, whether it's on text messaging or if you can use encrypted voice communication. Even if the adversary is able to intercept the data, if it is encrypted, it will make it impossible," Jeff Greene, the executive assistant director for cybersecurity at the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CSIA), told <em>NBC News.</em></p>

<p>An anonymous FBI official recommended that individuals seeking enhanced communication security consider using cellphones that receive timely operating system updates, devices with responsibly managed encryption and accounts protected by phishing-resistant two-factor authentication.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An unknown disease with flu-like symptoms has killed at least 79 people in the Democratic Republic of Congo, according to the <em>BBC</em>. The unidentified disease has infected 300 people in DR Congo since November 10, causing flu-like symptoms including fever, headaches, coughing, breathing difficulties and anaemia, the country's health ministry said. Most of the dead have been between the ages of 15 and 18, it added. In a statement on X, the ministry said the disease was of "still unknown origin" and had been detected in Kwango province in southwestern Congo.</p>

<p>Response teams have been sent to Kwango Province to manage cases and investigate the nature of the disease, the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y83ejz7eeo" rel="noindex,nofollow">outlet </a>reported. The government has urged citizens to stay calm and vigilant. They urged people to wash their hands with soap, avoid mass gatherings, and avoid touching the bodies of the deceased without qualified health personnel.</p>

<p>A World Health Organisation (WHO) Africa region official told BBC that they have "dispatched a team to the remote area to collect samples for lab investigations". The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which has an office in Congo, said it is aware of the situation and is providing technical assistance to a rapid response team dispatched by a local emergency operations centre, as per <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/mysterious-disease-congo-kills-dozens-rcna182804" rel="noindex,nofollow"><em>NBC News.&nbsp;</em></a></p>

<p>Symphorien Manzanza, a civil society leader, said that the situation is worrying as the number of infected people continues to rise. "Panzi is a rural health zone, so there is a problem with the supply of medicines," he said.</p>

<p>Separately, a local MP said that about 67 people had fallen sick and died between November 10 and 26. "It should be noted that Panzi Hospital is short of medicines to cope with this epidemic. We really need assistance," the MP said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Notably, the latest outbreak comes amid a time when the central African country is also dealing with a severe outbreak of mpox. It also comes just before the fifth anniversary of the first recorded case of Covid-19 in Wuhan, China.</p>

<p>DR Congo has also dealt with bouts of Ebola over the years.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The World Health Organization announced Thursday it had given a first-ever green light to a test for tuberculosis -- a disease which killed 1.25 million people last year.</p>

<p>Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra, produced by US-based molecular diagnostics company Cepheid, "is the first test for TB diagnosis and antibiotic susceptibility testing that meets WHO's prequalification standards", the UN health agency said.</p>

<p>WHO prequalification aims to ensure that key health products meet global standards for quality, safety and efficacy.</p>

<p>The WHO already recommended the test, but prequalification means that UN agencies such as UNICEF, or others like the Gavi vaccine alliance, have a simpler pathway to procure and distribute a product in countries with limited resources.</p>

<p>"This first prequalification of a diagnostic test for tuberculosis marks a critical milestone in WHO's efforts to support countries in scaling up and accelerating access to high-quality TB assays that meet both WHO recommendations and its stringent quality, safety and performance standards," said Yukiko Nakatani, a WHO assistant director-general.</p>

<p>"It underscores the importance of such groundbreaking diagnostic tools in addressing one of the world's deadliest infectious diseases."</p>

<p>A preventable and curable disease, TB is caused by bacteria and most often affects the lungs. It is spread through the air when people with lung TB cough, sneeze or spit.</p>

<p>In October, the WHO said a record 8.2 million new tuberculosis cases were diagnosed worldwide in 2023 -- the highest number since it began global TB monitoring in 1995.</p>

<p>And with 1.25 million related deaths, TB probably returned to being the world's leading cause of death from a single infectious agent, following three years in which it was replaced by Covid-19, the WHO added.</p>

<p>The test detects the genetic material of the bacterium that causes TB in spit samples, and provides an accurate result within hours.</p>

<p>The WHO says the accurate and early detection of TB, especially drug-resistant strains, is a critical global health priority.</p>

<p>"High-quality diagnostic tests are the cornerstone of effective TB care and prevention," said Rogerio Gaspar, the WHO's regulation and prequalification director.</p>

<p>The disease disproportionately affects 30 high-burden countries.</p>

<p>Five countries -- India, Indonesia, China, Philippines and Pakistan -- account for more than half of the global TB burden, with more than a quarter of the cases found in India alone.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Mr Cook, who took over as CEO in August 2011, said he'll continue to lead the company until he feels it's time to move on.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Apple CEO Tim Cook has finally addressed the question on everyone's mind: how long will he continue to lead the tech giant? In a recent interview with <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMLiMsjwBWI">Wired</a></em>, Mr Cook shared his thoughts on his future at Apple. The 64-year-old, who took over as CEO in August 2011, said he will continue to lead the company until he feels it's time to move on. He expressed his deep affection for Apple, calling it a "privilege of a lifetime" to be there.</p>

<p>When asked about his plans, he didn't give a definitive answer. Instead, he said, "I get asked that question now more than I used to...I love this place. It's a privilege of a lifetime to be here. And I'll do it until the voice in my head says, “It's time,” and then I'll go and focus on what the next chapter looks like."</p>

<p>Tim Cook reminisced about his nearly three-decade-long journey with Apple, confessing that the company has become an integral part of his life. He acknowledged that Apple has been the cornerstone of his professional and personal identity for so long that it's challenging for him to envision a life without it. He admitted that leaving Apple would be a difficult and emotional transition.</p>

<p>"But it's hard to imagine life without Apple because my life has been wrapped up in this company since 1998. It's the overwhelming majority of my adult life. And so I love it," Mr Cook said.</p>

<p><strong>About Tim Cook</strong></p>

<p>Born on November 1, 1960, in Mobile, Alabama, Mr Cook earned a Bachelor of Science degree in industrial engineering from Auburn University and an MBA from Duke University.&nbsp;Before joining Apple, he served as Vice President of Corporate Materials at Compaq and Chief Operating Officer of the Reseller Division at Intelligent Electronics. His early career also included a 12-year tenure at IBM, where he progressed to Director of North American Fulfillment.</p>

<p>Mr Cook's journey at Apple started in 1998 when he was recruited by Steve Jobs as Senior Vice President of Worldwide Operations. Rising through the ranks, he became CEO in 2011, succeeding Jobs. Under Mr Cook, Apple expanded significantly, launching successful products like the iPhone, Apple Watch, and AirPods. He shifted Apple's focus to sustainability, privacy, and health technology. Mr Cook's leadership is credited with maintaining Apple's innovation while managing a global business.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Apple CEO has received numerous awards and honours for his leadership and philanthropic efforts, including being named one of Time Magazine's 100 most influential people in the world.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Namibia's first woman president Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah on Thursday said her victory in a disputed vote last week had broken a "glass ceiling".]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Namibia's first woman president Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah on Thursday said her victory in a disputed vote last week had broken a "glass ceiling".</p>

<p>The vice-president secured just past 57 percent of the vote, well ahead of the candidate for the main opposition Independent Patriots for Change (IPC) on 25.5 percent, the election authority announced on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Yet the IPC has said it did not recognise the vote, pointing to a "multitude of irregularities".</p>

<p>"As a woman, I'm the first to admit that my election to the highest office in the land is definitely one that is breaking the glass ceiling for a Namibian woman," she told reporters at her first briefing since her victory's announcement.</p>

<p>Nandi-Ndaitwah, 72, became the first woman to rule the mineral-rich nation, governed by her South West Africa People's Organisation (SWAPO) party since independence from apartheid South Africa in 1990.</p>

<p>In her address, Namibia's new leader praised Liberia's former head of state Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, who in 2006 became the first woman president on the African continent, for being "the one who really led the way".</p>

<p>"And for me, it's just to reaffirm that equal responsibility of women and men in society is a reality," Nandi-Ndaitwah said.</p>

<p>Nandi-Ndaitwah, a SWAPO stalwart known by her initials NNN, will be among Africa's few women leaders.</p>

<p>The conservative daughter of an Anglican pastor, she assumed the role of vice president in February this year.</p>

<p>She has taken a strict stance on abortion, which is banned in the country except in exceptional circumstances, and has not championed women's rights.</p>

<p>Appearing without her traditional "doek" head wrap, Nandi-Ndaitwah on Thursday stressed that her victory gave her and her SWAPO party the "constitutional and moral legitimacy to govern".</p>

<p>But the November 27 election, which was extended until November 30, was marked by logistical and technical issues, including a shortage of ballot papers that led to long queues. Some voters gave up on the first day of voting after waiting for up to 12 hours.</p>

<p>The opposition outfit IPC said these were a deliberate attempt to frustrate voters and that it would not accept the results.</p>

<p><strong>'Radical shift'</strong></p>

<p>Nandi-Ndaitwah on Thursday promised drastic change.</p>

<p>"It's not going to be business as usual. We must have a radical shift in addressing the plight of our people, especially the downtrodden and the vulnerable communities," said the president-elect, who is due to take oath on March 21, 2025.</p>

<p>Nandi-Ndaitwah, who has been in government in 2000, refused to blame the electoral commission when asked about its management of the vote, saying the authority had brought the process to a conclusion.</p>

<p>The Electoral Commission of Namibia admitted to failures in the organisation of the vote, including a shortage of ballot papers and the overheating of electronic tablets used to register voters.</p>

<p>Of the nearly 1.5 million registered voters in the sparsely populated country, nearly 77 percent had cast ballots in the presidential vote, it said Tuesday.</p>

<p>Yet while the turnout exceeded that of the previous presidential vote, it was also particularly unequal.</p>

<p>In the northern regions of Ohangwena and Omusati, historic SWAPO strongholds where NNN performed best with nearly 80 and 83 percent of the ballot, voter turnout hit 91 and 92 percent, much higher than the rest of the country.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in the densely-populated Khomas region, which encompasses the capital Windhoek and where many electoral failings were recorded, only 67 percent of registered voters cast their ballots.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After making an effort to suspend civilian rule in South Korea and impose martial law, President Yoon Suk Yeol stands facing impeachment. But that's not the only downfall the country has witnessed. Previous leaders have seen their rule descend into disorder and tumult.</p>

<p>Here's a recap of the collapse of previous South Korean leaders:</p>

<h2><strong>Park Geun-hye - Impeached and jailed</strong></h2>

<p>In 2016, Park Geun-hye, South Korea's first female president, was impeached by Parliament and later imprisoned. Park, the daughter of former dictator Park Chung-hee, had been in office since 2013 and had touted herself as incorruptible. However, she faced accusations of accepting or soliciting tens of millions of dollars from conglomerates like Samsung. Additional allegations included leaking classified documents, blacklisting artists critical of her policies, and dismissing officials who opposed her.</p>

<p>Park's impeachment was confirmed by the Constitutional Court in March 2017, leading to her indictment and imprisonment. She was sentenced to 20 years in prison and hefty fines in 2021, but received a pardon from her successor, President Moon Jae-in, later that year. Interestingly, the current president, Yoon, played a crucial role in Park's dismissal and imprisonment as a Seoul prosecutor at the time.</p>

<h3><strong>Lee Myung-bak - 15 years in prison</strong></h3>

<p>Lee Myung-bak, the conservative predecessor of Park Geun-hye, was sentenced to 15 years in prison in October 2018 for corruption. He was found guilty of accepting bribes from Samsung in exchange for favours to the company's then-chairman, Lee Kun-hee, who had been convicted of tax evasion. However, Lee Myung-bak's prison term was cut short when he received a pardon from President Yoon in December 2022.</p>

<h3><strong>Roh Moo-hyun - Died by suicide</strong></h3>

<p>Roh Moo-hyun, the former President of South Korea from 2003 to 2008, tragically took his own life in May 2009 by jumping off a cliff. This devastating event occurred while he was under investigation for allegedly receiving bribes from a wealthy shoe manufacturer, totaling $6 million, which was paid to his wife and the husband of one of his nieces.</p>

<h3><strong>Chun Doo-hwan - "Butcher of Gwangju"</strong></h3>

<p>Chun Doo-hwan, the notorious military strongman known for his brutal suppression of the Gwangju uprising also known as the "Butcher of Gwangju", stepped down in 1987 amidst massive protests. He handed over power to his protégé Roh Tae-woo, with whom he had a decades-long relationship dating back to their time as classmates at military academy during the Korean War.</p>

<p>However, their legacy was marred by corruption and violence. In 1996, both Chun and Roh were convicted of treason for their roles in the 1979 coup that brought Chun to power, as well as the Gwangju uprising and other offenses. Chun was initially sentenced to death, but his sentence was commuted to life in prison. Roh received a 22.5-year prison sentence, which was later reduced to 17 years. Despite their convictions, both men were granted amnesty in 1998 after serving only two years in prison.</p>

<h3><strong>Park Chung-hee - Assassinated</strong></h3>

<p>Park Chung-hee, South Korea's dictator, was assassinated on October 26, 1979, by Kim Jae-gyu, his own spy chief, during a private dinner.</p>

<p>This shocking event has been the subject of intense debate in South Korea, with many questioning whether the murder was premeditated.</p>

<p>In the aftermath of Park's death, army generals Chun Doo-hwan and Roh Tae-woo seized the opportunity to plot a coup in December 1979, further plunging South Korea into political turmoil.</p>

<h3><strong>Yun Po-sun: Overthrown in coup</strong></h3>

<p>In 1961, President Yun Po-sun was ousted in a military coup orchestrated by army officer Park Chung-hee. Although Yun was initially allowed to remain in office, Park effectively seized control of the government. Park later solidified his power by winning the 1963 election, ultimately replacing Yun as president.</p>

<h3><strong>Syngman Rhee - Forced to resign</strong></h3>

<p>South Korea's first president, Syngman Rhee, was forced to resign in 1960 due to a massive student-led uprising. The protests were sparked by Rhee's attempt to extend his term through rigged elections, which ignited widespread outrage and calls for his removal.</p>

<p>Following his resignation, Rhee was exiled to Hawaii, where he spent the remainder of his life until his death in 1965.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President-elect Donald Trump has had a positive political view of India and it is in a much more advantageous position than many other countries to build "deeper" relations with his administration and take forward the bilateral ties, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar said on Thursday.</p>

<p>In an interactive session at industry chamber ASSOCHAM, Mr Jaishankar at the same time noted that like many other countries, India may also have some issues and it will deal with them.</p>

<p>The External Affairs Minister said there are countries which are looking at Trump 2.0 as a political challenge but for India, that is not the case.</p>

<p>"We'll have to work out a political equation with America and that is one area where we score because we've always had a positive political relationship with Trump. I would say Trump has always had a positive political view of India," he said.</p>

<p>"Like everybody else, we may also have some issues. We will deal with those issues, but I would say when I look around the world today, you know there are countries who (are) looking at Trump 2.0 as a political challenge. We are not," he said.</p>

<p>"And I think that separates us from a very large number of countries. We are in a much more advantageous position to translate 2.0 into a deeper relationship," he added.</p>

<p>Mr Jaishankar said the US would need India in many areas where they would like to take technology leads.</p>

<p>The two countries would have to build an understanding of mutual benefits and relationships in several areas like emerging and critical technologies as trusted partners.</p>

<p>There have been concerns in many countries over the Trump administration's policy over a range of sensitive issues including tariff, climate change and overall foreign policy priorities against the backdrop of the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the situation in West Asia.</p>

<p>On India's proposed free trade agreements with the European Union and the UK, Mr Jaishankar said there are certain non-trade complex issues.</p>

<p>"In the case of the EU, there are multiple members. So everybody has their interest. So how to harmonise it? That is a challenge. But overall we believe that it will benefit us," he said.</p>

<p>Mr Jaishankar said that a free trade deal with the EU will improve India's market access.</p>

<p>The external affairs minister described the markets in Europe as predictable and stable markets. "I would say from an economic standpoint, we should definitely put great effort into improving our access with Europe...In many ways, the risk factors are much less than in many other parts," he said.</p>

<p>Mr Jaishankar also said that the way important economies look at India has undergone a tremendous change in the last 10 years.</p>

<p>He said the third back-to-back term of the Narendra Modi government has impressed most nations and political leaders of the world.</p>

<p>Talking about the MSMEs and their role in manufacturing, the external affairs minister said it is one of the top priorities of the Modi government.</p>

<p>"We have to create more manufacturing zones, improve logistics and make ourselves more competitive. I think we have made progress but there is a lot we will have to do," he said.</p>

<p>The MSMEs have to deal with unfair competition and the government has to be protecting their interest, especially when negotiating free trade agreements.</p>

<p>He said the Modi government has been careful in this regard and has even sought review of FTA with ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) as the existing agreement has been leaving a negative impact on India's agriculture and MSMEs.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Sri Lankan Navy has said it has arrested 14 more Indian fishermen for allegedly fishing in the island nation's territorial waters and seized two fishing trawlers.</p>

<p>The arrests took place on Wednesday off the coast of the northeastern district of Mannar.</p>

<p>With this arrest, so far this year 529 Indian fishermen have been arrested and 68 trawlers confiscated, the navy said.</p>

<p>On Monday, 18 Indian fishermen were arrested by the Sri Lanka Navy in the Vettilaikerni area in the north.</p>

<p>Last month, Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake and Indian High Commissioner Santosh Jha held a meeting in which they stressed the importance of a long-term solution to the ongoing fishing disputes between the two nations.</p>

<p>The fishermen issue is a contentious one in the ties between India and Sri Lanka, with Lankan Navy personnel even firing at Indian fishermen in the Palk Strait and seizing their boats in several alleged incidents of illegally entering Sri Lankan territorial waters.</p>

<p>The Palk Strait, a narrow strip of water separating Tamil Nadu from Sri Lanka, is a rich fishing ground for fishermen from both countries.</p>

<p>Fishermen from both countries are arrested frequently for inadvertently trespassing into each other's waters.</p>

<p>In 2023, the island nation's Navy arrested 240 Indian fishermen for allegedly poaching in Sri Lankan waters</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Scientists have made a groundbreaking discovery about how our solar system could potentially capture a new planet. According to a research note in&nbsp;<em>Celestial Mechanics and Dynamical Astronomy,</em>&nbsp;our solar system can capture an interstellar object (ISO) or a rogue planet, which could lead to a significant change in our cosmic neighbourhood. The study is titled '<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10569-024-10223-1">Permanent Capture into the Solar System</a>'&nbsp; and authored by Edward Belbruno from Yeshiva University's Department of Mathematical Sciences and James Green, formerly of NASA and currently with Space Science Endeavours.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Phase Space</strong></p>

<p>The key to this phenomenon lies in the concept of phase space, a mathematical representation that describes the state of a dynamical system like our solar system. This complex framework, rooted in Hamiltonian mechanics, combines coordinates of position and momentum, effectively mapping all possible orbital configurations around the Sun. Key factors such as orbital eccentricity, semi-major axis, and orbital inclination all contribute to the phase space landscape.</p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;Solar System's phase space</strong></p>

<p>Our Solar System's phase space features two types of capture points: weak and permanent. Weak capture points are areas where objects can be temporarily drawn into semi-stable orbits. These points often occur at the intersection of gravitational boundaries between celestial bodies. They provide a gravitational "nudge" rather than a stable orbital adoption.</p>

<p>Permanent capture points, on the other hand, are regions where objects can be permanently captured into stable orbits. This occurs when an object's angular momentum and energy align in a precise configuration, allowing it to maintain a stable orbit.</p>

<p>The phase space of our Solar System is highly complex, involving numerous moving bodies and constantly changing coordinates. Subtle variations in these coordinates can cause objects to transition between permanent and weak capture states. Similarly, minor differences in the characteristics of interstellar objects (ISOs) or rogue planets can lead them into these capture points, potentially altering the dynamics of our Solar System.</p>

<p>"The permanent capture of a small body, P, about the Sun, S, from interstellar space occurs when P can never escape back into interstellar space and remains captured within the Solar System for all future time, moving without collision with the Sun," the researchers wrote.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"In addition to being permanently captured, P is also weakly captured," they added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Researchers have identified openings in the Sun's Hill sphere, a region where the Sun's gravity dominates, which could allow ISOs or rogue planets to enter into a stable orbit around the Sun.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p>

<p>President Emmanuel Macron on Thursday sought a new prime minister to prevent France from sliding deeper into political turmoil after Michel Barnier's government was ousted in a historic no-confidence vote in parliament.</p>

<p>Poised to be contemporary France's shortest-serving premier, Barnier met Macron at the Elysee Palace to submit his resignation, after the defeat in parliament on Wednesday forced his government to step down.</p>

<p>The vote was the first successful no-confidence action since a defeat for Georges Pompidou's government in 1962, when Charles de Gaulle was president.</p>

<p>Macron was to meet both upper and lower house parliament speakers before giving an address to the nation at 1900 GMT.</p>

<p>The president is believed to be in a hurry to appoint the new premier to avoid a vacuum, according to multiple sources who spoke to AFP.</p>

<p>Limiting any impression of political chaos is all the more important for Macron who on Saturday will host world leaders -- including US president-elect Donald Trump -- for the reopening of Notre Dame cathedral in Paris after the devastating 2019 fire.</p>

<p>A majority of lawmakers on Wednesday supported the no-confidence vote proposed by the hard left and backed by the far right headed by Marine Le Pen.</p>

<p>Barnier's record-quick ejection comes after snap parliamentary elections in June resulted in a hung parliament with no political force able to form an overall majority and the far right holding the key to the government's survival.</p>

<p>The trigger for Barnier's ouster was his 2025 budget plan including austerity measures that were unacceptable to a majority in parliament, but that he argued were necessary to stabilise France's finances.</p>

<p>On Monday he forced through a social security financing bill without a vote, but the ousting of the government means France is still without a budget.</p>

<p>National Assembly Speaker Yael Braun-Pivet urged Macron to quickly choose a new premier, saying that France could not be allowed to "drift" for long.</p>

<p>"Macron alone in the face of an unprecedented political crisis," said the Le Monde daily in its headline.</p>

<h2><strong>- 'Political stalemate' -</strong></h2>

<p>"France probably won't have a 2025 budget," said ING Economics in a note, predicting that the country "is entering a new era of political instability".</p>

<p>Moody's, a ratings agency, warned that Barnier's fall "deepens the country's political stalemate" and "reduces the probability of a consolidation of public finances".</p>

<p>The Paris stock exchange fell at the opening on Thursday before recovering to show small gains. Yields on French government bonds were again under pressure in debt markets.</p>

<p>Strike calls across transport, education and other public sector services were maintained on Thursday despite the disappearance of the austerity budget that has prompted anger.</p>

<p>Macron has more than two years of his presidential term left, but some opponents are calling on him to resign.</p>

<p>"We are now calling on Macron to go," Mathilde Panot, head of the parliamentary faction of the hard-left France Unbowed (LFI) party, told reporters.</p>

<p>She urged "early presidential elections" to solve the political crisis.</p>

<p>Macron has however vehemently rejected such a scenario, calling it "political fiction".</p>

<p>Taking care not to crow over the government's fall, Le Pen said in a television interview that, once a new premier is appointed, her party "would let them work" and help create a "budget that is acceptable for everyone".</p>

<p>She also, conspicuously, did not call on Macron to resign.</p>

<h3><strong>- Bayrou-Macron lunch -</strong></h3>

<p>Barnier is the fifth prime minister to serve under Macron since he came to power in 2017, with each premier serving a successively shorter period.</p>

<p>Given the composition of the National Assembly, there is no guarantee that Barnier's successor would last any longer.</p>

<p>Loyalist Defence Minister Sebastien Lecornu and Macron's centrist ally Francois Bayrou have been touted as possible contenders, as has former Socialist premier and interior minister Bernard Cazeneuve.</p>

<p>Bayrou, who leads the MoDem party, had lunch with the president at the Elysee, a source close to him told AFP.</p>

<p>Before his address to the nation, Macron was also to meet Braun-Pivet and upper-house Senate speaker Gerard Larcher.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Japan's process of brewing rice wine - Sake, has been recognised as an "intangible cultural heritage" by UNESCO on Wednesday.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a meeting in Paraguay, UNESCO committee members voted to recognise 45 practices and items for safeguarding humanity's cultural heritage. It also includes Brazilian white cheese, Caribbean cassava bread and Palestinian olive oil soap.</p>

<p>Producers hope this will boost interest in the traditional drink worldwide amid its waning popularity back home, with youngsters preferring imported wine, domestic beer or whiskey.</p>

<p>Sake dates back centuries and is made over several weeks by fermenting a mixture of rice, water, yeast and a mold called koji, that is the essence of the drink.</p>

<p>"We are very happy," said Takehiro Kano, Japan's permanent representative to UNESCO. He also told The Associated Press, "Sake is considered a divine gift and is essential for social and cultural events in Japan."</p>

<p>"Being recognised internationally by this mechanism will renew the interest of Japanese people in this area, and that could lead to more momentum for transmitting these skills and know-how to the next generation."</p>

<p>It is interesting how despite getting notability globally, the popularity in Japan for the drink has ebbed. Sake is usually served during ceremonies and special meals.</p>

<p>Apart from Sake, UNESCO delegates also approved &nbsp;Asturian cider culture in Spain and the making of giant barrels in Guatemala, among other items and practices admitted to the list on Wednesday.</p>

<p>In Tokyo, the Japanese prime minister, Shigeru Ishiba said in a statement, that he was "delighted" by the traditional sake-making and congratulated all dedicated to preserving and promoting the tradition.</p>

<p>In other news, Cate Blanchett had become the Creative Director of Toku Sake this year, and said she has been sake-obsessed for a long time.</p>

<p>Japan's delegation celebrated the recognition in traditional Japanese style where Kano raised a cypress box full of sake to toast the alcoholic brew.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russia will set up manufacturing plants across India, Vladimir Putin said today as he praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his "India-first" policies. President Putin, who spoke at an investment summit in Moscow today, said he was impressed by how PM Modi's 'Make in India' initiative was "strengthening India's position globally".</p>

<p>Expressing his admiration for Prime Minister Modi, President Putin acknowledged how New Delhi's policies have contributed to India's development by creating a a stable environment for growth.</p>

<p>Impressed with the 'Make in India' policy, Mr Putin said, "Prime Minister Modi has a program called Make in India. We are also ready to set up our manufacturing operations in India. The Indian government, under the Prime Minister's leadership, has been creating stable conditions, driven by a policy of putting India first. We believe that investing in India is profitable." He said that Russian company Rosneft has recently invested $20 billion in India.</p>

<p>Mr Putin also emphasised how India's leadership has focused on "prioritising its national interests" which has translated to India's robust growth and the well-being of its citizens, making a special mention of how India created "stable conditions" for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).</p>

<p>In his speech at the 15th VTB Russia Calling Investment Forum, President Putin also highlighted the significance of the evolution of the BRICS and BRICS+ forums and the contribution of Russia's import substitution program in that context.</p>

<p>President Putin also urged for greater cooperation among BRICS nations to support the growth of SMEs and encouraged member countries to identify key areas for collaboration at the upcoming summit in Brazil next year. "I urge my BRICS colleagues to evaluate the current situation in key areas of cooperation," he said.</p>

<p>Referring to the investment platform Russia is developing with partner countries in BRICS, President Putin said that it has the potential to benefit all partners and is expected to become an important instrument for supporting our economies and providing financial resources to the countries of the Global South and East.<br />

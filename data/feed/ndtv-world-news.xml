<p>"Hamas calls on the mediators to present a roadmap to put into action what was proposed to Hamas... based on the vision of Biden and the decisions of the UN Security Council, and to force the occupier (Israel) to implement it, rather than hold more talks or bring new proposals," the Palestinian movement said in a statement.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel expanded evacuation orders in Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip overnight, forcing tens of thousands of Palestinian residents and displaced families to leave in the dark as explosions from tank shelling reverberated around them.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said it was attacking operatives from the Hamas group - which administered Gaza before the war - who were using those areas to stage attacks and fire rockets.</p>

<p>On Saturday, an Israeli airstrike on a school where displaced Palestinians were sheltering in Gaza City killed at least 90 people, according to the civil defence service, prompting an international outcry.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Israeli military said it had struck a Hamas and Islamic Jihad militant command post, an allegation the two groups rejected as a pretext, and killed 19 operatives.</p>

<p>In Khan Younis in the south of the Gaza Strip, the evacuation instruction covered districts in the centre, east and west, making it one of the largest such orders in the 10-month-old conflict, two days after tanks returned to the east of the city.</p>

<p>The announcement was posted on X and in text and audio messages to residents' phones: "For your own safety, you must evacuate immediately to the newly created humanitarian zone. The area you are in is considered a dangerous combat zone."</p>

<p>Philippe Lazzarini, head of the United Nations' agency for Palestinian refugees UNRWA, said people in Gaza were trapped and had nowehere to go.</p>

<p>"Some are only able to carry their children with them, some carry their whole lives in one small bag. They are going to overcrowded places where shelters are already overflowing with families. They have lost everything and need everything," he said.</p>

<p>The Israeli army said it had struck around 30 Hamas military targets in the previous 24 hours, including military structures, anti-tank missile launch posts, and weapons storage facilities.</p>

<p>The Islamic Jihad armed wing said fighters fired mortar bombs against Israeli forces massing in the eastern areas of Khan Younis.</p>

<p>Later on Sunday, an Israeli airstrike near the Khan Younis market at the center of the city killed four Palestinians and wounded several others, medics said.</p>

<p>Lines of smoke rose from areas where Israeli planes carried attacks in the eastern and western parts of the city. Residents said two multi-floor buildings were bombed.</p>

<p>Nearly 40,000 Palestinians have been killed in the Israeli offensive in Gaza since the war broke out last October and the toll is rising by the day, the Gaza health ministry says.</p>

<p>Gaza health officials say most of the fatalities have been civilians but Israel says at least a third are fighters. Israel says it has lost 329 soldiers in Gaza. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>Israel began its assault on Gaza after Hamas fighters stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, killing 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and capturing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.</p>

<h3><strong>Tens Of Thousands Forced To Leave Overnight</strong></h3>

<p>Most of Gaza's 2.3 million people have been displaced from their homes, according to the United Nations, while their narrow strip of land has largely been reduced to a wasteland of rubble.</p>

<p>Palestinian and United Nations officials say there are no safe areas in the enclave. Areas designated as humanitarian zones, like Al-Mawasi in western Khan Younis where residents were being sent, have been bombed several times by Israeli forces.</p>

<p>Tens of thousands left their homes and shelters in the middle of the night, heading west toward Mawasi and north toward Deir Al-Balah, already overcrowded with hundreds of thousands of displaced people.</p>

<p>"We're exhausted. This is the 10th time I and my family have had to leave our shelter," said Zaki Mohammad, 28, who lives in the Hamad housing project in western Khan Younis, where the occupants of two multi-floor buildings were ordered to leave.</p>

<p>"People are carrying their belongings, their children, their hopes and their fears and running towards the unknown, because there is no safe place," he told Reuters via a chat app. "We are running from death to death."&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Two migrants died on Sunday in the Channel off the northern coast of France trying to reach Britain by boat, French maritime authorities said.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two migrants died on Sunday in the Channel off the northern coast of France trying to reach Britain by boat, French maritime authorities said.</p>

<p>The new drownings near the French city of Calais mean nine people have lost their life attempting the dangerous sea crossing this month alone, and 25 since the start of the year.</p>

<p>A boat was signalled as being in distress on Sunday morning at sea between Calais and Dunkirk and "two people were declared dead", the maritime authorities said.</p>

<p>The vessel in trouble 10 kilometres (6 miles) north of Calais had 56 migrants on board, said Jacques Billant, prefect of the Pas-de-Calais department.</p>

<p>Among the 54 surviving passengers, and another 50 people from another boat who were rescued, five were receiving medical care, he said.</p>

<p>In 2023, 12 migrants had died at sea trying to reach what they hoped would be a better life in Britain, according to the French authorities.</p>

<p>The death count this year has already surpassed that, with 25 migrants who have lost their lives since January, Billant said.</p>

<p>He said those crossing the sea often did so "without a lifejacket", on "vessels of very poor quality because not inflated enough and often without a solid bottom... or decent engine".</p>

<p>A non-governmental organisation called L'Auberge des Migrants ("The migrant hostel") on X mourned the deaths.</p>

<p>"This border kills in the greatest of silences," it said.</p>

<p>As of August 8, 17,639 people had crossed the sea on so-called "small boats" to Britain this year, according to an AFP tally of British government figures.</p>

<p>That is very close to the figure for the same period in 2022, a year of record crossings.</p>

<h3><strong>'Smuggler networks'</strong></h3>

<p>After the Labour party's victory in the British general election in July, Prime Minister Keir Starmer and France's President Emmanuel Macron pledged to strengthen "cooperation" in handling the surge in undocumented migrant numbers.</p>

<p>Starmer has cancelled a plan by the former Conservative government to send irregular migrants to a holding camp in Rwanda.</p>

<p>French authorities seek to stop migrants taking to the water but do not intervene once they are afloat except for rescue purposes, citing safety concerns.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, both governments are seeking to crack down on the people-smuggling gangs who organise the crossings and are paid thousands of euros by each migrant for the risky trip.</p>

<p>Billant said more than 350 people have been arrested and 15 "smuggler networks" dismantled since the start of the year.</p>

<p>The new migrant deaths come as the United Kingdom has been rocked by anti-migrant unrest, following a knife attack on July 29 that killed three children and was falsely linked on social media to a Muslim immigrant.</p>

<p>Thousands of anti-racism demonstrators rallied across the United Kingdom on Saturday against the riots that targeted mosques and hotels linked to immigration.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p>

<p>US President Joe Biden, in his first TV interview since withdrawing from the election, has said he acted under pressure from fellow Democrats and out of a determination to see Donald Trump beaten.</p>

<p>Explaining his shock exit in new detail, Biden said party colleagues standing for reelection feared he was damaging their chances as his age and mental abilities came to dominate the campaign.</p>

<p>Biden, 81, has kept a low profile since ending his second-term bid on July 21 after his flailing debate performance against Trump triggered a slow-burning Democrat revolt against him.</p>

<p>In the short TV interview, recorded in the White House last week and broadcast on Sunday, the president appeared frail but cogent, again admitting he failed in the debate but stressing that health-wise he has "no serious problem."</p>

<p>"A number of my Democratic colleagues in the House and Senate thought that I was going to hurt them in the (election) races," he explained.</p>

<p>"I was concerned if I stayed in the race, that would be the topic you'd be interviewing me about," he continued.</p>

<p>He singled out former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a party heavyweight whose refusal to explicitly back his campaign was seen by many as pivotal.</p>

<p>"You'd be interviewing me about why did Nancy Pelosi say (something)... I thought it'd be a real distraction," Biden said.</p>

<p>"A critical issue for me still is -- not a joke -- maintaining this democracy.</p>

<p>"I have an obligation to the country to do what is the most important thing we can do, and that is -- we must, we must, we must defeat Trump."</p>

<h3><strong>Helping Harris</strong></h3>

<p>Biden said he was proud of his record on jobs, investment and Covid recovery -- and vowed to campaign hard for Vice President Kamala Harris, who has replaced him on the ballot.</p>

<p>"I'm going to do whatever Kamala thinks I can do to help most," he said.</p>

<p>Democrats' hopes of winning have soared since Biden's withdrawal, as Harris enjoys a surge in support that has left Trump and the Republicans struggling.</p>

<p>The outgoing president said he had expected to serve only one term when he won in 2020, but that he had been persuaded to push for a second.</p>

<p>"I thought of myself as being a transition president -- I can't even say how old I am. It's hard for me to get it out of my mouth -- but things got moving so quickly, it didn't happen," he told CBS's Robert Costa.</p>

<p>As Harris holds huge rallies in swing states, Trump's light schedule has come under scrutiny, and it was his running mate, J.D. Vance, who blitzed the Sunday morning political talk shows.</p>

<p>Appearing on CNN, ABC and CBS, Vance fielded questions about child care, asylum seekers and abortion.</p>

<p>In one testy exchange with CBS's Margaret Brennan, Vance complained that she had asked "six questions about abortion."</p>

<p>"I'm still trying to get a clear answer," Brennan retorted.</p>

<p>He also claimed that Harris was the one "calling the shots" in the Biden administration.</p>

<p>"If she's not calling the shots, Dana, who is?" he told CNN's Dana Bash.</p>

<p>Biden in his CBS interview warned that Trump was "a genuine danger to American security."</p>

<p>"Mark my words, if he wins... watch what happens," he said. "He's a genuine danger to American security.</p>

<p>"Look, we're at an inflection point in world history... and democracy is the key."</p>

<p>He added that he was "not confident at all" of a peaceful transfer of power if Trump loses a second time.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The virus is primarily spread through insect bites, including mosquitoes, and originates from pale-throated sloths, non-human primates, and birds.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A debilitating virus originating from sloths and transmitted by midges has been reported in Europe for the first time, officials have confirmed. In June and July, Europe saw 19 imported cases of the Oropouche virus, as reported by the European Center for Disease Control. Spain accounted for 12 cases, Italy for five, and Germany for two, the Manchester Evening News.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The virus is primarily spread through insect bites, including mosquitoes, and originates from pale-throated sloths, non-human primates, and birds.</p>

<p>Currently, there is no vaccine available for the virus, which belongs to the same family of diseases as Zika virus and Dengue Fever.</p>

<p>Dr Danny Altmann, a professor of Immunology at Imperial College London, told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/science-and-disease/oropouche-virus-outbreak-amazon-jungle-brazil-south-america/"><em>The Telegraph</em></a>, "We should definitely be worried. Things are changing and may become unstoppable."</p>

<p>Outbreaks of the virus have previously been reported in several countries across South and Central America, as well as the Caribbean. In 2024, specific outbreaks were recorded in Brazil, Bolivia, Colombia, Peru, and more recently in Cuba.</p>

<p>Of the cases recorded in Europe, 18 involved recent travel to Cuba, while one case in Italy involved travel to Brazil.</p>

<p>Oropouche can cause symptoms such as headaches, nausea, vomiting, and muscle and joint pains, with more severe symptoms occurring occasionally. These symptoms typically subside after four days. According to the ECDC, fatal outcomes are extremely rare, and recovery is common.</p>

<p>However, The Lancet reported on July 25 that two deaths caused by Oropouche were recorded for the first time in Brazil, involving two young women with no underlying health conditions.</p>

<p>Between January and mid-July, more than 8,000 cases were reported in Brazil, Bolivia, Peru, Colombia, and Cuba.</p>

<p>The ECDC assesses the risk of infection for EU citizens travelling to or residing in epidemic areas as moderate due to the high number of cases reported in the Americas.</p>

<p>The European authority has advised travellers to affected regions to use personal protective measures to reduce the risk of insect bites, both during outdoor activities and inside homes. This includes the use of insect repellent and wearing long-sleeved shirts and long trousers.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Muhammad Yunus was on Sunday acquitted in a graft case filed by the Anti-Corruption Commission, three days after he took oath as the head of Bangladesh's interim government, according to a media report.</p>

<p>Judge Md Rabiul Alam of the Special Judge's Court-4 of Dhaka accepted the Anti-Corruption Commission's application which was filed with the court, seeking withdrawal of prosecution of the case, following section 494 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, an official of the anti-graft agency was quoted as saying by The Daily Star newspaper.</p>

<p>On August 7, a Dhaka court acquitted Yunus and three top officials of Grameen Telecom - Ashraful Hassan, M Shahjahan and Nurjahan Begum - in a labour law violation case.</p>

<p>Yunus, the 84-year-old economist, on Thursday took oath as the chief adviser of the interim government.</p>

<p>Nurjahan Begum, who was also an accused in the graft case, is a member of the 16-member Council of Advisers which will assist Yunus in running the state's affairs.</p>

<p>Yunus had been in a protracted row with the Sheikh Hasina government due to obscure reasons while authorities initiated a series of investigations against him after she came to power in 2008.</p>

<p>Bangladesh authorities launched a review of the statutory Grameen Bank's activities in 2011 and fired Yunus as its founding managing director on charges of violating the government retirement regulation.</p>

<p>Yunus was charged under dozens of cases during Hasina's regime.</p>

<p>In January, a court sentenced Yunus to six months in jail on charges of labour law violation.</p>

<p>Many people believe Hasina became enraged when Yunus announced that he would form a political party in 2007 when a military-backed government ran the country and Hasina was in prison.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hundreds of mourners gathered Sunday in Southport, northwest England, for the funeral of a nine-year-old girl killed in last month's knife attack, which sparked more than a week of nationwide disorder.</p>

<p>Family, friends, community leaders and emergency responders all joined Alice da Silva Aguiar's parents for an emotional ceremony at a Catholic church in the seaside town, nearly two weeks after the mass stabbing that shocked the country.</p>

<p>Attendees had been asked to wear white, a tradition for some in Portugal, where Alice's parents hail from.</p>

<p>Locals lining the main road clapped as the funeral cortege -- bearing a small white coffin, resting on a carriage pulled by two white horses with colourful feathers -- passed by.</p>

<p>"Of course we're here -- it's the Southport spirit," said one man who turned out. "We're here to pay our respects."</p>

<p>Pink ribbons and balloons had been tied to lampposts and garden walls near the church.</p>

<p>Several hundred people packed inside the venue for the service -- featuring short addresses, readings, prayers and hymns -- which was relayed on loudspeakers to those who had gathered outside.</p>

<p>Jinnie Payne, the headteacher of the primary school the nine-year-old attended, was among those to speak movingly.</p>

<p>"Alice, you will forever be in our hearts," she told the congregation.</p>

<p>The July 29 mass stabbing at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class killed two other girls -- Bebe King, six, and Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven -- and injured 10 others including eight children.</p>

<p>Those wounded have all since been released from hospital.</p>

<h3><strong>'Unimaginable violence'</strong></h3>

<p>Bebe's parents, Lauren and Ben King, described Saturday how their "world was shattered by the loss of our precious daughter".</p>

<p>"She was taken from us in an unimaginable act of violence that has left our hearts broken beyond repair," they said in a statement released through police, adding she was "full of joy, light, and love".</p>

<p>The couple also revealed their elder daughter, Genie, witnessed the attack and managed to escape.</p>

<p>The stabbings sparked a riot in Southport the following evening, on July 30, and violence in more than a dozen English towns and cities as well as Northern Ireland over the ensuing week.</p>

<p>Officials have blamed the violence on far-right agitators and opportunist "thugs" accused of using the tragedy to further their anti-immigration, anti-Muslim agenda.</p>

<p>Misinformation spread online in the immediate aftermath of the stabbing spree claimed that the perpetrator was a Muslim immigrant.</p>

<p>British-born Axel Rudakubana has been charged with murder and attempted murder over the attack. His parents hail from Rwanda, which is overwhelmingly Christian.</p>

<p>A motive for the attack has not been disclosed, but police have said it is not being treated as terrorism-related.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iranian courts have reduced jail terms for two female journalists charged with collaborating with the United States, their lawyers told reformist newspapers on Sunday.</p>

<p>Elaheh Mohammadi, 37, and Niloufar Hamedi, 31, are out on bail after more than a year in Tehran's Evin prison for their coverage of the September 2022 death in custody of Mahsa Amini which had sparked nationwide protests.</p>

<p>In January, Iran's judiciary said it had launched new proceedings against the two women for posing for pictures without the mandatory headscarf upon their release that month.</p>

<p>Two separate appeals courts in Tehran ruled to acquit the women of the charge of collaboration with the United States, the lawyers were quoted as saying by Shargh and Ham Mihan dailies.</p>

<p>Originally, Mohammadi had been sentenced to six years in jail while Hamedi had been handed a seven-year sentence, according to the judiciary.</p>

<p>The pair were also each given five-year sentences for collusion and conspiring against state security and one year for propaganda against the Islamic republic.</p>

<p>The lawyers said these sentences were upheld by the appeals court and would be served concurrently, adding, however, that they hope the journalists would be freed under an amnesty announced last year by supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.</p>

<p>"Considering that the remaining two accusations meet the full conditions of the amnesty directive of 2023, we hope that Elaheh Mohammadi will be pardoned, and this case will be closed by issuing a suspension of execution order," Mohammadi's lawyer Shahab Mirlohi told Ham Mihan newspaper.</p>

<p>Hamedi's lawyers issued a similar statement.</p>

<p>Hamedi, a photographer for Shargh, was arrested less than a week after Amini's death after posting a picture of the young woman's grieving family on social media.</p>

<p>Ham Mihan reporter Mohammadi was arrested after going to Amini's hometown of Saqez, in the western Iranian province of Kurdistan, to cover her funeral which turned into a demonstration.</p>

<p>Amini, a 22-year-old Iranian Kurd, had been arrested for an alleged breach of strict dress rules for women, in place since shortly after Iran's 1979 Islamic revolution.</p>

<p>Following her death, months-long protests shook Iran, with hundreds of people, including dozens of security personnel, killed in the unrest, and thousands of demonstrators arrested.</p>

<p>Nine men were executed in cases related to the protests which Iranian authorities generally labelled "foreign-instigated riots".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Bangladesh's new interim government helmed by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus said on Sunday it had "grave concern" over reports of attacks on Hindus and other religious minorities in the past week.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bangladesh's new interim government said Sunday it was working to resolve attacks on Hindus and other religious minorities reported after the dramatic ouster of autocratic premier Sheikh Hasina.</p>

<p>Hindus are the largest minority faith in mostly Muslim Bangladesh and are considered a steadfast support base for Hasina's party, the Awami League.</p>

<p>After Hasina's abrupt resignation and flight abroad on Monday brought an end to her 15 years of autocratic rule, there were numerous reports of attacks against Hindu households, temples and businesses.</p>

<p>"The attacks on religious minorities in some places have been noted with grave concern," the interim cabinet said in its first official statement since its Thursday appointment.</p>

<p>The cabinet said it would "immediately sit with the representative bodies and other concerned groups to find ways to resolve such heinous attacks".</p>

<p>Sunday's statement from the self-styled "council of advisors" tasked with steering democratic reforms in the South Asian nation of 170 million people listed numerous urgent priorities.</p>

<p>The government, led by Nobel peace laureate Muhammad Yunus, ordered "support" for the families of protesters who were killed in the weeks of demonstrations culminating in Hasina's departure.</p>

<p>It directed public funds to pay for those injured in the unrest, which began in July and killed more than 450 people.</p>

<p>The council also said it would reopen the metro system in the capital Dhaka by the end of the week and soon appoint a new central bank governor, replacing a Hasina loyalist forced to resign.</p>

<h3><strong>Institutional purge</strong></h3>

<p>Earlier in the day a new chief justice was sworn in to office the day after his predecessor, another Hasina ally accused of sublimating the Supreme Court to her government's will, quit following protester demands.</p>

<p>It is the latest in a string of fresh appointments to replace an old guard viewed as linked to the previous regime, ousted by the student-led uprising.</p>

<p>New top justice Syed Refaat Ahmed studied at the University of Dhaka, Oxford and Tufts University in the United States.</p>

<p>Ahmed replaced Obaidul Hassan after hundreds of protesters gathered outside the court to demand the latter step-down.</p>

<p>Appointed last year, Hassan earlier oversaw a much-criticised war crimes tribunal that ordered the execution of Hasina's opponents, and his brother was her longtime secretary.</p>

<p>Hasina, 76, fled by helicopter to neighbouring India on Monday as protesters flooded Dhaka's streets in a dramatic end to her iron-fisted rule.</p>

<p>Her government was accused of widespread human rights abuses, including the extrajudicial killing of thousands of her political opponents, during her 15-year rule.</p>

<p>Cabinet ministers left blindsided by her sudden fall have gone to ground, while several other top appointees have been forced out of office, including the national police chief.</p>

<p>Interim leader Yunus, 84, returned from Europe on Thursday to lead a temporary administration facing the monumental challenge of ending disorder and enacting democratic reforms.</p>

<p>The restoration of law and order was the caretaker administration's "first priority", Yunus said.</p>

<p>Yunus won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006 for his pioneering work in microfinance, credited with helping millions of Bangladeshis out of grinding poverty.</p>

<p>He took office as "chief advisor" to a caretaker administration, comprised of fellow civilians bar one retired brigadier-general, and has said he wants to hold elections "within a few months".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Identifying China as both a competitor and an adversary, Republican vice presidential nominee Senator J D Vance said on Sunday that his party wants to establish a robust international framework where the US can "check" Beijing.</p>

<p>"I think they're both, right, and I think that what we want to do here is build the kind of international order where we can check China," Mr Vance told CBS in an interview when asked if he views Beijing as a competitor or an adversary.</p>

<p>"We don't want to go to war with China, but certainly they're an adversary...for example, the Chinese know that they're manufacturing tons of fentanyl, they're letting them come into our country. (Vice president and Democratic presidential candidate) Kamala Harris has done nothing about this," Mr Vance said in "Face the Nation" programme.</p>

<p>He said Harris should apply diplomatic and economic leverage on the Chinese to stop manufacturing fentanyl, which is smuggled into the Mexican drug cartels and subsequently shipped into the US.</p>

<p>Responding to a question, Mr Vance said China needs to be warned about it.</p>

<p>"You walk to Beijing, you talk to (President) Xi Jinping, and you say, your entire economy is going to collapse unless you get access to American markets. You need to take this fentanyl seriously or we are going to impose serious tariffs and economic penalties for not following our laws and not helping us stem the flow of this deadly poison," he said.</p>

<p>This is unlikely going to impact the American economy, Mr Vance said.</p>

<p>"I think that we have a powerful economy, with the best workers in the entire world. If we need to fight a trade war with the Chinese, we will fight it and we will win it, but we cannot do what Kamala Harris has done, which is be so terrified of using the economic power that we have that she's not even willing to stop the flow of this deadly poison coming into our country," he claimed.</p>

<p>According to the Ohio Senator, the former president and Republican presidential nominee, Donald Trump, gets along with world leaders, and there's nothing wrong with him complimenting them as people, if it makes him more effective diplomatically.</p>

<p>"If you actually have a good relationship with people and they trust you to follow your word. We have to remember that Democrats, including Kamala Harris, attacked Donald Trump for having a good relationship with Vladimir Putin. Well, when Donald Trump was president, Vladimir Putin didn't invade another country.</p>

<p>"...So maybe they should take a lesson from Trump's pray - playbook about diplomatic legitimacy, because I think Donald Trump got a lot done because world leaders respected him," Mr Vance said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An airstrike on a vehicle in eastern Syria near the porous border with Iraq killed at least five fighters from pro-Iran units, two security sources in the region told Reuters.</p>

<p>They include Iraqi armed groups that also control the Iraqi side of the frontier.</p>

<p>The border is now a smuggling hub, with weapons brought across from Iraq into Syria and other goods flowing into Iraq.</p>

<p>The U.S. and Israel have both carried out strikes in Syria against Iran-aligned factions.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p>

<p>US President Joe Biden, in his first TV interview since withdrawing from the election, has said he acted under pressure from fellow Democrats and out of a determination to see Donald Trump beaten.</p>

<p>Explaining his shock exit in new detail, Biden said party colleagues standing for reelection feared he was damaging their chances as his age and mental abilities came to dominate the campaign.</p>

<p>Biden, 81, has kept a low profile since ending his second-term bid on July 21 after his flailing debate performance against Trump triggered a slow-burning Democrat revolt against him.</p>

<p>In the short TV interview, recorded in the White House last week and broadcast on Sunday, the president appeared frail but cogent, again admitting he failed in the debate but stressing that health-wise he has "no serious problem."</p>

<p>"A number of my Democratic colleagues in the House and Senate thought that I was going to hurt them in the (election) races," he explained.</p>

<p>"I was concerned if I stayed in the race, that would be the topic you'd be interviewing me about," he continued.</p>

<p>He singled out former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a party heavyweight whose refusal to explicitly back his campaign was seen by many as pivotal.</p>

<p>"You'd be interviewing me about why did Nancy Pelosi say (something)... I thought it'd be a real distraction," Biden said.</p>

<p>"A critical issue for me still is -- not a joke -- maintaining this democracy.</p>

<p>"I have an obligation to the country to do what is the most important thing we can do, and that is -- we must, we must, we must defeat Trump."</p>

<h3><strong>Helping Harris</strong></h3>

<p>Biden said he was proud of his record on jobs, investment and Covid recovery -- and vowed to campaign hard for Vice President Kamala Harris, who has replaced him on the ballot.</p>

<p>"I'm going to do whatever Kamala thinks I can do to help most," he said.</p>

<p>Democrats' hopes of winning have soared since Biden's withdrawal, as Harris enjoys a surge in support that has left Trump and the Republicans struggling.</p>

<p>The outgoing president said he had expected to serve only one term when he won in 2020, but that he had been persuaded to push for a second.</p>

<p>"I thought of myself as being a transition president -- I can't even say how old I am. It's hard for me to get it out of my mouth -- but things got moving so quickly, it didn't happen," he told CBS's Robert Costa.</p>

<p>As Harris holds huge rallies in swing states, Trump's light schedule has come under scrutiny, and it was his running mate, J.D. Vance, who blitzed the Sunday morning political talk shows.</p>

<p>Appearing on CNN, ABC and CBS, Vance fielded questions about child care, asylum seekers and abortion.</p>

<p>In one testy exchange with CBS's Margaret Brennan, Vance complained that she had asked "six questions about abortion."</p>

<p>"I'm still trying to get a clear answer," Brennan retorted.</p>

<p>He also claimed that Harris was the one "calling the shots" in the Biden administration.</p>

<p>"If she's not calling the shots, Dana, who is?" he told CNN's Dana Bash.</p>

<p>Biden in his CBS interview warned that Trump was "a genuine danger to American security."</p>

<p>"Mark my words, if he wins... watch what happens," he said. "He's a genuine danger to American security.</p>

<p>"Look, we're at an inflection point in world history... and democracy is the key."</p>

<p>He added that he was "not confident at all" of a peaceful transfer of power if Trump loses a second time.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iran's new president presented his cabinet to parliament on Sunday for a vote of confidence, state media reported, proposing seasoned pragmatic diplomat Abbas Araqchi as foreign minister at a time of heightened regional tensions.</p>

<p>President Masoud Pezeshkian is shaping his cabinet at a time of an increased risk of escalation of the conflict in Gaza into a broader regional war, after the recent killings of Palestinian Islamist group Hamas' leader Ismail Haniyeh in Iran and of Hezbollah military commander Fuad Shukr in Beirut drew threats of retaliation against Israel.</p>

<p>Following the death of hardline President Ebrahim Raisi in a helicopter crash in May, Pezeshkian won a snap election last month by promising to improve ties with the world, promoting a pragmatic foreign policy, and to ease social restrictions at home.</p>

<p>Pezeshkian's proposed cabinet lineup requires lawmakers' approval and parliament speaker Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf said that parliamentary commissions will start reviewing his candidates on Monday.</p>

<p>Araqchi, 61, who was Iran's ambassador to several countries, including Japan, played a key role in negotiating Tehran's 2015 nuclear agreement with six world powers, which then-U.S. President Donald Trump exited in 2018 and re-imposed sanctions on Iran.</p>

<p>Araqchi later led Iran's negotiators during multilateral efforts - ultimately unsuccessful - to revive the pact via indirect diplomacy with Washington before he was replaced by hardline Ali Bagheri Kani in 2021.</p>

<p>The president's powers are limited in the Islamic Republic by those of the Supreme Leader, who is commander-in-chief of the armed forces, appoints the head of the judiciary and has the last say on major policies.</p>

<p>Tensions between Iran and the West have increased over Tehran's fast-advancing nuclear programme and its threats to "harshly punish" Israel over the assassination of Haniyeh.</p>

<p>Tehran and Hamas accuse Israel of carrying it out, though it has not claimed or denied responsibility for the killing.</p>

<p>Separately, Iran's president nominated Mohsen Paknezhad as oil minister, who has served as deputy oil minister overseeing hydrocarbon resources between 2018 and 2021.</p>

<p>Pezeshkian has also nominated Farzaneh Sadeq as the road and transportation minister. If approved by the parliament, she would become only the second woman cabinet minister in the Islamic Republic's history.</p>

<p>The first one was appointed in 2009 by hardliner Mahmoud Ahmadinejad who was president at the time.</p>

<p>Under the president's proposed lineup Raisi's Intelligence Minister Esmail Khatib would keep his position in the new cabinet.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>China supports Iran in defending its "sovereignty, security and national dignity", Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi told Iran's acting foreign minister in a phone call on Sunday, according to a statement by China's foreign ministry.</p>

<p>In the phone call, Wang repeated Beijing's denunciation of the assassination of Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran on July 31, saying the strike had violated Iran's sovereignty and threatened regional stability.</p>

<p>Iran and the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas have accused Israel of carrying out strike that killed Haniyeh.</p>

<p>Israel has not claimed or denied responsibility for the killing, which has fueled concern that the war between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip was turning into a wider Middle East war.</p>

<p>Iran has vowed to "harshly punish" Israel over the assassination.</p>

<p>Wang told Ali Bagheri Kani, Iran's Acting Foreign Minister, that the killing of Haniyeh had "directly undermined the Gaza ceasefire negotiation process and undermined regional peace and stability," China's foreign ministry said.</p>

<p>"China supports Iran in defending its sovereignty, security and national dignity in accordance with the law, and in its efforts to maintain regional peace and stability, and stands ready to maintain close communication with Iran," Wang was quoted as saying.</p>

<p>Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian on Sunday nominated Abbas Araqchi as the country's foreign minister. Araqchi had been Iran's chief negotiator in nuclear talks from 2013 to 2021.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russia's army appeared to acknowledge Sunday that Ukrainian units had driven deep into the country, saying it had hit troops and equipment around 30 kilometres (20 miles) from the border.</p>

<p>Kyiv launched a surprise border incursion last Tuesday, shocking Russia, which has sent in additional reserves, tanks, drones, artillery and aviation to try to quash the offensive.</p>

<p>The defence ministry in Moscow said Sunday that its troops had "foiled attempts by enemy mobile groups with armoured vehicles to break through deep into Russian territory."</p>

<p>But in an apparent sign of how far some Ukrainian units have managed to advance, it said it had hit enemy units near the villages of Tolpino and Obshchy Kolodez, which are around 25 km and 30 km from the Russia-Ukraine border.</p>

<p>A senior Ukrainian official told AFP that "thousands" of its troops had been deployed to the operation.</p>

<p>Russia's army said Sunday it had continued to use aviation, drones and artillery to try to put down the attack.</p>

<p>It also said it had foiled an attempt by Ukraine to break into another border district of the Kursk region, further to the south from where the bulk of the fighting has occurred so far.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The UK government said on Sunday schools in England could teach children how to spot extremist and online content spreading "putrid conspiracy theories", under planned changes to the national curriculum.</p>

<p>Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson said she was launching a review of the curriculum in primary and secondary schools to introduce critical thinking across multiple subjects.</p>

<p>It follows recent disorder in more than a dozen English towns and cities following the Southport knife attack, which officials say were fuelled by misinformation online and far-right agitators.</p>

<p>The stabbing spree, allegedly carried out by British-born Axel Rudakubana, who was aged 17 at the time, left three children dead. Police have not disclosed a suspected motive for the attack but said it is not being treated as terrorism.</p>

<p>Online speculation in the immediate aftermath of the tragedy falsely claimed Rudakubana was a Muslim immigrant.</p>

<p>"It's more important than ever that we give young people the knowledge and skills to be able to challenge what they see online," Phillipson told the Sunday Telegraph newspaper.</p>

<p>"That's why our curriculum review will develop plans to embed critical skills in lessons to arm our children against the disinformation, fake news and putrid conspiracy theories awash on social media."</p>

<p>Under the envisaged changes, students would analyse newspaper articles in English lessons to help spot fabricated clickbait, while computer classes would include analysing statistics in context.</p>

<p>However, the review is not set to report its findings and recommendations until next year, meaning reforms would not come into force until the school year starting in September, 2025, according to the Telegraph.</p>

<p>The moves are set to be combined with tougher regulation of social media sites and online content, with Prime Minister Keir Starmer suggesting imminent action on Friday.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The lawyer of the main suspect in a foiled plot to carry out an attack at Taylor Swift concert in Vienna on Sunday sought to play down the seriousness of the plan, saying her client was only "playing with ideas".</p>

<p>Swift's three planned concerts this week were cancelled after Austrian authorities discovered a plot allegedly led by a 19-year-old to carry out an ISIS-inspired suicide attack at a soccer stadium where tens of thousands of fans were planning to attend the shows.</p>

<p>Austrian investigators said the youth had recently sworn a pledge to ISIS and had made a full confession after police raided his house, seizing chemicals, machetes and other devices the plotters planned to use in a bomb attack.</p>

<p>Lawyer Ina-Christin Stiglitz told Reuters the youth had only been involved with ISIS for the past month.</p>

<p>"It interested him," she said, suggesting that her client had not really intended to carry out a serious attack.</p>

<p>"It was just playing with ideas," she said. "He says the bomb wasn't of good enough quality, it wouldn't have worked."</p>

<p>He had researched online on how to build a bomb, she added.</p>

<p>Among three other teenagers Austrian police have detained in the investigation was a 17-year-old youth, whom Stiglitz said her client had described as his "best friend and neighbour".</p>

<p>Neighbours of the 19-year-old in the small town of Ternitz expressed shock at his arrest, describing him as reserved but friendly. One of few hints pointing to potential radicalization was that he had recently grown a long beard, they said.</p>

<p>Responding to a question about why he had changed his appearance, his lawyer said: "He wanted to be cool."</p>

<p>Chancellor Karl Nehammer said earlier that Austria's intelligence agencies should have greater power to monitor communications on messaging apps to stop extremists.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A BSF officer is winning hearts for his calmness while explaining hundreds of Bangladesh refugees gathered at India's border why they cannot let them in.&nbsp;The video, shared by former Union Minister and Shiv Sena leader Milind Deora, shows the officer speaking to a group of refugees in a border area in West Bengal's Coochbehar.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Speaking in Bengali, the officer is heard saying, "We all know the problems you are facing. You have come here, but a discussion is required. The problem cannot be solved in this manner. We cannot let you in even if we want."</p>

<p>As the gathering protests, the officer continues, "Please listen to me, nothing will come out of shouting. The whole world knows your problem. But a discussion is needed. Once the discussion happens, we will see how we can protect you. You can see, senior officers are here. But if you say that we have to allow you immediately, is that possible?"</p>

<p>"I request you on behalf of my country. Your problems would be addressed through a discussion. We request you to go back, a solution cannot be find in an hour or two," the officer is heard saying in a video shared by The Indian Express.</p>

<p>Voices from the crowd are heard pleading with the BSF personnel to let them. "They will burn our homes, we will face atrocities," the crowd shouts.</p>

<p>The BSF officer says the officers know they are in trouble. "My seniors have had discussions with your force. They will listen to your problems. They have asked you to return," he says.</p>

<p>Praising the officer for his composure, Mr Deora said in a post on X, "This video of a BSF officer calmly explaining to Bangladeshis why they can't enter India illegally is heartbreaking, inspirational &amp; reassuring all at once."</p>

<p>"Heartbreaking to see the desperation; inspirational to witness the officer's calm composure; reassuring to know the government is committed to securing India's borders," said the Rajya Sabha MP, who switched from the Congress to the Eknath Shinde-led Sena earlier this year.</p>

<p>Bangladeshi nationals fleeing violence and arson in the aftermath of Sheikh Hasina's ouster as Prime Minister have gathered at India's borders in several areas. The BSF is keeping close vigil on the borders. In Bangladesh, members of the Hindu community are holding demonstrations to protest against the attacks on homes and businesses of Hindus.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As an interim government led by Nobel peace prize winner takes charge of Bangladesh, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said India hopes for an early return to normalcy in Bangladesh and called upon the government to ensure the safety of Hindus.</p>

We hope for an early return to normalcy, ensuring the safety and protection of Hindus and all other minority communities. India remains committed to working with Bangladesh to fulfill the shared aspirations of both our peoples for peace, security and development," the Prime Minister said in a post on X.</p>

<p>Mr Yunus has&nbsp;condemned attacks on the minority communities and urged the youth to protect Hindu, Christian, and Buddhist families from harm.&nbsp;“Are they not the people of this country? You have been able to save the country; can't you save some families?...You must say — no one can harm them. They are my brothers; we fought together, and we will stay together,” he has said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A short story by Bram Stoker, the legendary author of "Dracula", has been unearthed by a lifelong enthusiast in Dublin who stumbled upon the work while browsing in a library archive.</p>

<p>Titled "Gibbet Hill", the story was uncovered by Brian Cleary in a Christmas supplement of the Dublin edition of the Daily Mail newspaper from 1890 and had remained undocumented for more than 130 years.</p>

<p>The rare find, which has never been referenced in any Stoker bibliography or biography, is now being brought to the public for the first time at an exhibition in the Irish capital.</p>

<p>"Dracula", the Gothic, mysterious and supernatural vampire novel from 1897 may have been set in Transylvania and England but its author, Stoker, was a Dubliner.</p>

<p>"I read 'Dracula' as a child and it stuck with me, I read everything from and about Stoker that I could get my hands on," said Cleary, 44, a writer and amateur historian who lives in the Marino neighbourhood of Dublin where the author grew up.</p>

<p>Thanks to "Dracula", Stoker "had a massive impact on popular culture, but is under-appreciated", Cleary told AFP in the Casino at Marino, an opulent 18th-century building near the writer's birthplace that is hosting the exhibition.</p>

<p><strong>'Flabbergasted'</strong></p>

<p>Cleary's journey of discovery began in 2021 when a sudden onset of deafness changed his life.</p>

<p>While on leave to retrain his hearing after having cochlear implant surgery, Cleary visited the National Library of Ireland to indulge his interest in historical literature and the works of Stoker.</p>

<p>There, in October 2023, he chanced upon the hidden literary gem, the "Gibbet Hill" story which he had never heard of before.</p>

<p>"I sat in the library flabbergasted, that I was looking at potentially a lost ghost story from Stoker, especially one from around the time he was writing 'Dracula', with elements of 'Dracula' in it," said Cleary.</p>

<p>"I sat looking at the screen wondering, am I the only living person who had read it? Followed by, what on earth do I do with it?"</p>

<p>Cleary did extensive literary searches to verify the find and consulted Stoker expert and biographer Paul Murray who confirmed the story was unknown, lost and buried in the archives for more than 130 years.</p>

<p>"'Gibbet Hill' is very significant in terms of Stoker's development as a writer, 1890 was when he was a young writer and made his first notes for 'Dracula'," Murray told AFP.</p>

<p>"It's a classic Stoker story, the struggle between good and evil, evil which crops up in exotic and unexplained ways, and is a way station on his route to publishing 'Dracula'."</p>

<p><strong>Illustrations</strong></p>

<p>The macabre tale tells of a sailor murdered by three criminals whose bodies were strung up on a gibbet or hanging gallows on a hill as a ghostly warning to passing travellers.</p>

<p>To celebrate the discovery, "Gibbet Hill" has been captured in a book that features cover art and illustrations inspired by the story by respected Irish artist Paul McKinley.</p>

<p>"It's quite surreal now to be standing next to a picture inspired by three of the characters in the story," said Cleary.</p>

<p>"When Brian sent me the 'Gibbet Hill' there was so much I could work with," said McKinley.</p>

<p>His eery, sometimes sinister illustrations include a "juicy, wet, oily painting" of worms inspired by a young character in the story who has a bunch of earthworms in his hands.</p>

<p>"Making new images for an old story that has been buried for so long" was a "fascinating challenge" said the artist.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cuba's electrical grid collapsed again early on Saturday morning, state-run media reported, plunging the entire country into blackout for a second time just hours after authorities announced they had begun reestablishing service.</p>

<p>CubaDebate, one of the islands state-run media outlets, said Cub's grid operator, UNE, had reported at 6:15AM the "total disconnection of the national electro-energetic system."</p>

<p>"The Electric Union is working on its reestablishment," the brief message said.</p>

<p>Cub's electrical grid first collapsed around midday on Friday after one of the island's largest power plants failed, suddenly leaving more than 10 million without power.</p>

<p>Even before the grid's collapse, an electricity shortfall on Friday had forced Cub's communist-run government to send non-essential state workers home and cancel school classes for children as it sought to conserve fuel for generation.</p>

<p>But lights began to flicker on in scattered pockets across the island early in the evening on Friday, offering some hope that power would be restored.</p>

<p>The grid operator has not yet provided any details on what caused the grid to collapse again on Saturday, or how long it will take to reestablish service.</p>

<p>Cub's government has blamed weeks of worsening blackouts - often 10 to 20 hours a day across much of the island - on deteriorating infrastructure, fuel shortages and rising demand.</p>

<p>Strong winds that began with Hurricane Milton last week had also complicated the island's ability to deliver scarce fuel from boats offshore to feed its power plants, officials have said.</p>

<p>Fuel deliveries to the island have dropped off significantly this year, as Venezuela, Russia and Mexico, once key suppliers, have reduced their exports to Cuba.</p>

<p>Key ally Venezuela slashed by half its deliveries of subsidized fuel to Cuba this year, forcing the island to search elsewhere for far more pricey oil on the spot market.</p>

<p>Cuba's government also blames the U.S. trade embargo, as well as sanctions under then-President Donald Trump, for ongoing difficulties in acquiring fuel and spare parts to operate and maintain its oil-fired plants.</p>

<p>The United States on Friday denied any role in the grid collapse in Cuba.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli planes dropped leaflets over southern Gaza on Saturday showing a picture of the dead Hamas chief Yahya Sinwar with the message that "Hamas will no longer rule Gaza", echoing language used by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.</p>

<p>The move came as Israeli military strikes killed at least 35 people across the Gaza Strip and its forces tightened a siege around hospitals in Jabalia in the north of the enclave, Palestinian health officials said.</p>

<p>"Whoever drops the weapon and hands over the hostages will be allowed to leave and live in peace," the leaflet, written in Arabic, read, according to residents of the southern city of Khan Younis and images circulating online.</p>

<p>The leaflet's wording was from a statement by Netanyahu on Thursday after Sinwar was killed by Israeli soldiers operating in Rafah, in the south near the Egyptian border, on Wednesday.</p>

<p>The October 7 attack Sinwar planned on Israeli communities a year ago killed around 1,200 people, with another 253 dragged back to Gaza as hostages, according to Israeli tallies.</p>

<p>Israel's subsequent war has devastated Gaza, killing more than 42,500 Palestinians, with another 10,000 uncounted dead thought to lie under the rubble, Gaza health authorities say.</p>

<p>In the central Gaza Strip camp of Al-Maghzai, an Israeli strike on a house killed 11 people, while another strike at the nearby camp of Nuseirat killed four others.</p>

<p>Five other people were killed in two separate strikes in the south Gaza cities of Khan Younis and Rafah, medics said, while seven Palestinians were killed in the Shati camp in the northern Gaza Strip.</p>

<p>Later on Saturday, an Israeli strike killed three Palestinians in Nuseirat in central Gaza, medics said.</p>

<p>Late on Friday, medics said 33 people, mostly women and children, were killed and 85 others were wounded in Israeli strikes that destroyed at least three houses in Jabalia.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said it was unaware of that incident.</p>

<p>It said forces were continuing operations against Hamas across the enclave, killing several gunmen in Rafah and Jabalia and dismantling military infrastructure. Palestinian medics said five people were killed in Jabalia on Saturday.</p>

<p><strong>EVACUATION ORDERS</strong></p>

<p>Residents and medics said Israeli forces had tightened their siege on Jabalia, the largest of the enclave's eight historic camps, which it encircled by also sending tanks to nearby towns of Beit Hanoun and Beit Lahiya and issuing evacuation orders to residents.</p>

<p>Israeli officials said evacuation orders were aimed at separating Hamas fighters from civilians and denied that there was any systematic plan to clear civilians out of Jabalia or other northern areas.</p>

<p>In Jabalia, residents said Israeli army forces besieged several shelters housing displaced families before they stormed them and detained dozens of men. Footage circulated on social media, which Reuters could not immediately verify, showed dozens of Palestinian men sitting on the ground next to a tank, while others were led by a soldier to a gathering site.</p>

<p>Residents and medical officials said Israeli forces were bombing houses and besieging hospitals, preventing medical and food supplies from entering to force them to leave the camp.</p>

<p>Health officials said they refused orders by the Israeli army to evacuate the hospital or leave the patients, many in a critical condition, unattended.</p>

<p>"The Israeli occupation is intensifying its targeting of the health system in the northern Gaza Strip, by besieging and directly targeting the Indonesian Hospital, Kamal Adwan Hospital, and Al-Awda Hospital during the past hours and its insistence on putting them out of service," the Gaza health ministry said.</p>

<p>It said two patients in intensive care at the Indonesian Hospital died "as a result of the hospital's siege and the power outage and medical supplies".</p>

<p>Israel's military said the troops operating in the area had been "briefed on the importance of mitigating harm to civilians and medical infrastructure".</p>

<p>"It is emphasized that the hospital continues to operate without disruption and in full capacity, and there was no intentional fire directed at it," it said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>China's consulate in Myanmar's city of Mandalay was attacked with an explosive device, local media said Saturday, adding that no deaths or injuries were reported.</p>

<p>The blast occurred at the consulate office in central Mandalay, south of the sprawling Royal Palace, around 7 pm Friday (1230 GMT Friday), local media said.</p>

<p>China is a major ally and arms supplier to Myanmar's junta, but it also maintains ties with ethnic groups fighting the military in Myanmar's northern Shan state, according to analysts.</p>

<p>Myanmar has been in turmoil since the military deposed the government of Aung San Suu Kyi and seized power in 2021.</p>

<p>A statement from the junta on Saturday night blamed "terrorists" for the incident, which it said it was investigating in cooperation with consulate officials.</p>

<p>It said security had found "a blast" had occurred and that it was "raising the necessary security measures".</p>

<p>"About two feet of clay tiles of the roof of the two-storey building were damaged," the statement said.</p>

<p>A Myanmar official in Mandalay confirmed to AFP there had been "an incident at the Chinese consulate office compound in Mandalay late evening yesterday".</p>

<p>"There was no one injured," the official said, without specifying the nature of the incident.</p>

<p>The Irrawaddy outlet reported a grenade had been thrown at the compound, which is usually guarded by members of Myanmar's security forces.</p>

<p>The Voice of Myanmar newspaper reported the consulate had been hit by an unidentified "explosion" without giving details.</p>

<p>China's embassy in Yangon did not respond to AFP's queries.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It's usually a serene two-and-a-half-hour ride on Japan's famously efficient bullet train. But the journey quickly descended into a zombie apocalypse, with passengers screaming in terror.</p>

<p>Organisers of Saturday's adrenaline-filled trip, less than two weeks before Halloween, touted it as the "world's first haunted house experience on a running shinkansen".</p>

<p>On board one chartered car of the shinkansen -- the Japanese word for bullet train -- were around 40 thrill-seekers, ready to brave an encounter with the living dead between Tokyo and the western metropolis of Osaka.</p>

<p>The eerie experience was inspired by the hit 2016 South Korean action-horror movie "Train to Busan", in which a father and daughter trapped on a moving train battle zombies hungry for human flesh.</p>

<p>All seemed normal at first as the bullet train made a peaceful departure Saturday evening, but it wasn't long until the first gory attack.</p>

<p>The victims -- actors planted in seats by the organisers -- jerked in agony and then underwent a terrifying transformation before starting a rampage against their fellow passengers.</p>

<p>Event organiser Kenta Iwana of the group Kowagarasetai, which translates to the "scare squad", said they wanted to "depict the normally safe, peaceful shinkansen -- something we take for granted -- collapsing in the blink of an eye".</p>

<p><strong>'Like I was in the film'</strong></p>

<p>Sitting next to one of the actors was Joshua Payne, one of many foreign tourists on board.</p>

<p>"I literally felt like I was in the film, just sitting here watching it take place in front of me," the 31-year-old American told AFP.</p>

<p>"The fact that we can physically go from Tokyo to Osaka right now and have this whole performance at the same time... I think is really cool and maybe a little bit groundbreaking," he said.</p>

<p>It was far from Central Japan Railway Company's first experiment with the usually dazzlingly clean, accident-free shinkansen, a Japanese institution that turned 60 this year.</p>

<p>After demand for long-distance travel plunged during the Covid-19 pandemic, the railway operator started renting out bullet train compartments for special events to diversify its business.</p>

<p>A sushi restaurant, a bar and even a wrestling match have been hosted on the high-speed train, and carriages can also be reserved for private parties.</p>

<p>Marie Izumi of JR Central's tourism subsidiary told AFP that she was surprised by the idea for a zombie-themed commute when Kowagarasetai approached her, thinking it would be "almost impossible to pull off".</p>

<p>But the event has convinced her of "new possibilities" for the bullet train, Izumi said, adding that concerts and comedy shows might be a good fit in the future.</p>

<p><strong>Thriller</strong></p>

<p>On Saturday, toy chainsaws and guns were used as props, but depictions of extreme violence and gore that could tarnish the shinkansen's squeaky-clean reputation were avoided.</p>

<p>To counterbalance the subdued horror, the two-and-a-half-hour tour was peppered with light-hearted performances by zombie cheerleaders, magicians and comedians, including a choreographed dance to Michael Jackson's "Thriller".</p>

<p>"Nobody wants to sit tight for such a long time being constantly exposed to horror," said Ayaka Imaide from Kowagarasetai.</p>

<p>Many aboard the zombie-infested train said the experience alone was worth the ticket price of up to 50,000 yen ($335).</p>

<p>"It was very immersive," Naohiko Nozawa, 30, told AFP. "And the appearance of so many different kinds of zombies kept me entertained all the way."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>"Quite often over the last few years, you've had to really try hard to overcome all that was being aimed at you.</p>

<p>"You just wanted to be loved and to make people happy with your music," she added.</p>

<p>On Friday, Liam Payne's father visited the Buenos Aires hotel where his son plunged to his death from a third-floor balcony two days earlier, thanking fans gathered nearby in a shared moment of grief.</p>

<p>After landing in the Argentine capital that morning, Geoff Payne also visited the morgue where the body of his 31-year-old son was being kept pending the results of toxicological tests.</p>

<p>Meanwhile reactions continued to stream in, including from Girls Aloud star Cheryl Tweedy, Payne's former partner and the mother of their seven-year-old boy, Bear.</p>

<p>She called his death an "earth shattering event".</p>

<p>In a social media message, Tweedy hit out at "abhorrent reports and media exploitation" following Payne's passing, which were causing "further harm to everyone left behind picking up the pieces".</p>

<p>"Before you leave comments or make videos, ask yourself if you would like your own child or family to read them," she said.</p>

<p>"Please give Liam the little dignity he has left in the wake of his death to rest in some peace at last."</p>

<p>Payne died from "multiple traumas" and "internal and external haemorrhaging" after falling from the balcony of his room at the Casa Sur hotel in central Buenos Aires, an autopsy found.</p>

<p>Investigators said he appeared to have been "going through an episode of substance abuse."</p>

<p>Among others to pay tribute on Friday was Simon Cowell, the creator of and judge on "The X Factor" show that launched One Direction in 2010.</p>

<p>Cowell said he was "truly devastated", in an Instagram post also spoke directly to Payne.</p>

<p>"I want you to know how much love and respect I have for you," he said.</p>

<p>"I watched you spending so much time with people who had wanted to meet you. You really cared."</p>

<p>Cowell added that a meeting with Payne last year reminded him "that you were still the sweet, kind boy I had met all of those years ago."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gaza's health ministry said two patients at a hospital in the territory's north died during a siege by Israeli forces around the facility on Saturday, while Israel's military reported its troops were operating in the area.</p>

<p>Since dawn, Israeli forces had surrounded and shelled the Indonesian Hospital in the northern town of Beit Lahia, Gaza health officials said.</p>

<p>"Israeli tanks have completely surrounded the hospital, cut off electricity and shelled the hospital, targeting the second and third floors with artillery," the facility's director Marwan Sultan said.</p>

<p>"There are serious risks to medical staff and patients."</p>

<p>Later on Saturday, the health ministry of the Hamas-run territory said two patients in the hospital had died, blaming the Israeli military siege.</p>

<p>It said the military operation caused "the death of two patients inside the Indonesian Hospital in the northern Gaza Strip, as a result of the hospital's siege and the power outage and (lack of) medical supplies".</p>

<p>The ministry did not provide details about the two patients, their illnesses or the exact cause of their deaths.</p>

<p>It also accused the Israeli military of imposing a siege on hospitals across northern Gaza since midnight.</p>

<p><strong>'State of great panic'</strong></p>

<p>In an earlier statement, the ministry said Israel had targeted the upper floors of the Indonesian Hospital, adding there were "more than 40 patients and wounded in addition to the medical staff" present.</p>

<p>"Heavy gunfire" towards the hospital and its courtyard had sparked a "state of great panic" among patients and staff, it added.</p>

<p>When asked for a response to the ministry's allegation that the two patients had died due to the military siege, the Israeli army told AFP that its troops were "operating near the Indonesian Hospital".</p>

<p>"The troops operating in the area have been trained for the operational activity and briefed on the importance of mitigating harm to civilians and medical infrastructure," the military said in a statement.</p>

<p>"It is emphasised that the hospital continues to operate without disruption and in full capacity, and there was no intentional fire directed at it."</p>

<p>Israeli forces launched a new offensive in northern Gaza earlier this month, saying it was targeting Hamas fighters who were regrouping there.</p>

<p>Gaza's civil defence agency said an Israeli strike the night before killed 33 people in Jabalia, which is near the Indonesian Hospital.</p>

<p>The UN humanitarian affairs agency on Friday continued "to sound the alarm about the increasingly dire and dangerous situation that civilians in northern Gaza are facing. Families there are trying to survive in atrocious conditions, under heavy bombardment."</p>

<p>Indonesian Hospital was also damaged during Israeli shelling in October 2023, residents told AFP at the time.</p>

<p>Israel has come under strong international criticism for targeting hospitals in Gaza, which it has repeatedly accused of being used by Hamas militants for military purposes.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has warned Hezbollah that its alleged attempt to assassinate him and his wife was a "grave mistake" and anybody who tries to harm Israel's citizens would pay a heavy price.</p>

<p>Mr Netanyahu's warning was seen as a response to a drone being launched towards his residence in the Israeli town of Caesarea.</p>

<p>In a post on X on Saturday, Mr Netanyahu referred to Hezbollah as "Iran's proxy" and said the assassination attempt would not deter him or Israel from continuing the war against the country's enemies.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The attempt by Iran's proxy Hezbollah to assassinate me and my wife today was a grave mistake. This will not deter me or the State of Israel from continuing our just war against our enemies in order to secure our future," Mr Netanyahu wrote.&nbsp;</p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p>Issuing a warning to Iran and the 'Axis of Resistance', which includes Hezbollah, Hamas and Yemen's Houthis, the prime minister said Israel is determined to achieve its war objectives and "change the security reality in our region for generations".</p>

<p>"I say to Iran and its proxies in its axis of evil: Anyone who tries to harm Israel's citizens will pay a heavy price; We will continue to eliminate the terrorists and those who dispatch them; We will bring our hostages home from Gaza; And we will return our citizens who live on our Northern border safely to their homes. Israel is determined to achieve all our war objectives and change the security reality in our region for generations to come," he warned.</p>

<p>A drone was launched at Mr Netanyahu's residence on Saturday, a day after Hamas confirmed that its chief Yahya Sinwar was killed in an Israeli attack in Gaza.</p>

<p>"A UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) was launched toward the prime minister's residence in Caesarea. The prime minister and his wife were not at the location, and there were no injuries in the incident," Mr Netanyahu's office said in a statement.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Israeli military said three drones had been fired from Lebanon on Saturday and two had been intercepted.</p>

<p>Neither Hezbollah nor any other militant group has claimed responsibility for the drone attack so far.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sinwar was allegedly the architect of the October 7, 2023, attacks on Israel in which over 1,200 Israelis were killed and over 250 taken hostage. Sinwar, who was killed on Wednesday, took over as the chief of Hamas after his predecessor Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated in Iran's capital, Tehran.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chinese President Xi Jinping called this week for troops to strengthen their preparedness for war, state media reported today, just days after Beijing staged large-scale military drills around Taiwan.</p>

<p>Xi made his comments while visiting a brigade of the People's Liberation Army Rocket Force on Thursday, according to state-run broadcaster CCTV.</p>

<p>Xi said the military should "comprehensively strengthen training and preparation for war, (and) ensure troops have solid combat capabilities", state media CCTV reported.</p>

<p>Soldiers must "enhance their strategic deterrent and combat capability," Xi said.</p>

<p>China, which claims Taiwan as part of its territory, has stepped up its shows of force around the self-ruled island in recent years.</p>

<p>On Monday, Beijing had deployed fighter jets, drones, warships and coast guard vessels to encircle Taiwan -- its fourth round of large-scale war games around the democratic island in just over two years.</p>

<p>China's communist leaders have insisted they will not rule out using force to bring Taiwan under Beijing's control.</p>

<p>Xi on Thursday said the Chinese military must "strongly safeguard the country's strategic security and core interests", according to the CCTV report.</p>

<p>The dispute between China and Taiwan dates back to a civil war in which the nationalist forces of Chiang Kai-shek were defeated by Mao Zedong's communist fighters and fled to the island in 1949.</p>

<p>China and Taiwan have been ruled separately since then.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Trade minister Piyush Goyal today said that India has sought a critical mineral partnership agreement with the United States as he hopes for talks on a broader trade pact between the two nations.</p>

<p>"I had suggested that critical mineral MoU (memorandum of understanding) to be converted to a critical mineral partnership and become a starting point to become an FTA (Free Trade Agreement)," Piyush Goyal told reporters at a press briefing in New Delhi.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, India and the US signed an initial pact to cooperate on strengthening supply chains in the two countries for lithium, cobalt and other critical minerals used in electric vehicles and clean energy applications.</p>

<p>The MoU fell far short of a full critical minerals trade deal that would allow India to benefit from the $7,500 US electric vehicle tax credit.</p>

<p>Minerals-focused trade deals are one way that the US President Joe Biden's administration hopes to open up access for trusted allies to a $7,500 per vehicle EV tax credit introduced in last year's climate-focused Inflation Reduction Act.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A year ago, in October 2023, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was grappling with his country's most significant security failure, facing backlash both at home and abroad. After decades of promoting a tough image, Netanyahu appeared politically exposed following Hamas's attack on Israel on October 7, 2023. A year later, on October 18, Netanyahu's hold on power seemed stronger than it had been after announcing the death of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar.</p>

<p>The killing of Sinwar, who orchestrated October 7 attacks, is seen as a vindication for Prime Minister Netanyahu, Israel's longest-serving prime minister.</p>

<p><strong>Background and political career</strong></p>

<p>Born on October 21, 1949, in Tel Aviv, Benjamin Netanyahu's mother, Tzila Segal, was an Israeli-born Jew, while his father, Benzion Netanyahu, was from Poland who changed his name from Benzion Mileikowsky upon settling in Jerusalem.</p>

<p>Benjamin Netanyahu was raised in Jerusalem and attended high school in the US. His father was a historian. In 1963, the family moved to Philadelphia, US, where he spent his formative years.</p>

<p>At 18, Benjamin Netanyahu returned to Israel and served five years in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) as a captain in the elite Sayeret Matkal commando unit.</p>

<p>Following his military service, Netanyahu pursued higher education at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), earning an MBA in 1976. His studies were briefly interrupted by the Yom Kippur War in 1973, where he served as a soldier. The loss of his brother Jonathan during the Entebbe raid in 1976 spurred him to establish the Jonathan Institute, dedicated to addressing terrorism-related issues through international conferences.</p>

<p>Fluent in English with a notable American accent, he quickly became a prominent voice for Israel, frequently appearing on US television as a strong advocate for his country. In 1982, he became Israel's deputy chief of mission in Washington. Two years later, he was appointed Israel's permanent representative to the United Nations in New York.</p>

<p>Benjamin Netanyahu's political career truly began in 1988 when he was elected to the Knesset (Israel's parliament) as a member of the Likud party. He swiftly rose through the ranks, serving as deputy foreign minister from 1988 to 1991 and later as deputy minister. In 1993, he became the leader of the Likud party, gaining prominence for his staunch opposition to the Israel-PLO peace accords and the subsequent Israeli withdrawals from the West Bank and Gaza Strip.</p>

<p><strong>Netanyahu's first term as PM</strong></p>

<p>At 47, Benjamin Netanyahu became Israel's youngest prime minister after the 1996 elections. His tenure began amid unrest, with strained relations with Syria and backlash from his decision to open a tunnel near the Al-Aqsa Mosque, sparking violent clashes.</p>

<p>Despite his staunch opposition to the 1993 Oslo peace accords, Benjamin Netanyahu made notable concessions during his first term as PM. He signed an agreement transferring 80% of Hebron to Palestinian Authority control and approved further withdrawals from the occupied West Bank, moves that drew sharp criticism from his right-wing base.</p>

<p>In 1999, after calling early elections 17 months ahead of schedule, Netanyahu was defeated by Labour leader Ehud Barak.</p>

<p>After this loss, Netanyahu remained a prominent figure in Likud but lost the party leadership to Ariel Sharon. He later served as foreign minister and finance minister in Sharon's government.</p>

<p><strong>Return to power</strong></p>

<p>In the February 2009 elections, Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud party secured 27 seats in the Knesset, narrowly trailing Kadima's 28. Netanyahu formed a coalition government with Yisrael Beiteinu, Shas and smaller parties, officially assuming office on March 31, 2009.</p>

<p>During this term, Netanyahu offered conditional support for a Palestinian state, but insisted it be demilitarised and recognise Israel as a Jewish state - conditions rejected by Palestinian leaders. Peace talks stalled in 2010 after Israel ended a moratorium on West Bank settlements.</p>

<p>Netanyahu's foreign policy was defined by his hardline stance on Iran, consistently advocating for international action against its nuclear programme.</p>

<p>Domestically, rising economic discontent triggered mass protests in 2011, with citizens demanding better public services. His coalition also struggled with tensions over military draft exemptions for ultra-Orthodox Jews, leading to early elections in 2012.</p>

<p>After returning to power post the elections with a more centrist coalition, Benjamin Netanyahu led a military operation in Gaza in 2014 following rocket attacks. Despite international criticism over civilian casualties, he claimed the operation weakened militant capabilities.</p>

<p>By late 2014, internal strife within his coalition over budget and legislation led to the dismissal of key cabinet members and elections in 2015. Relations with then US President Barack Obama became increasingly strained, particularly over Iran, culminating in Netanyahu's controversial address to the US Congress in early 2015.</p>

<p>Despite predictions of a tight race in the March 2015 elections, Netanyahu's Likud party emerged victorious.</p>

<p><strong>Corruption allegations and coalition crises</strong></p>

<p>Benjamin Netanyahu faced charges of fraud, breach of trust and corruption stemming from long-running investigations. Indicted in 2019, he was accused of accepting lavish gifts from millionaire associates and seeking regulatory favours for media moguls in exchange for positive coverage. Netanyahu denied any wrongdoing and refused to resign following his indictment, branding the investigations a politically motivated witch-hunt orchestrated by law enforcement, the media and the courts.</p>

<p>The corruption allegations became a rallying point for opposition parties, uniting politicians from across Israel's political spectrum. This growing opposition ultimately led to his ouster after the March 2021 elections, ending Netanyahu's another term as prime minister.</p>

<p><strong>2022 electoral comeback and controversy</strong></p>

<p>In early 2022, Benjamin Netanyahu's corruption trial faced setbacks after reports surfaced that police had used Pegasus spyware to hack the phones of key witnesses. Netanyahu's defence further questioned the allegations, citing an incorrect meeting date in the indictment.</p>

<p>As opposition leader, Netanyahu aggressively targeted the ruling coalition. The November 2022 elections saw a record voter turnout, with Netanyahu returning to power through a controversial coalition that included far-right ministers.</p>

<p><strong>Israel-Hamas war</strong></p>

<p>On October 7, 2023, Hamas launched a massive attack on Israel by land, sea, and air. In response, Israel launched airstrikes on Gaza. A ground invasion soon followed, intensifying the Israel-Hamas War.</p>

<p>Benjamin Netanyahu faced heavy criticism for his handling of the crisis, blamed for both the unpreparedness leading up to October 7 and the management of hostages and displaced civilians. Polls showed declining support for Netanyahu.</p>

<p>Internationally, Benjamin Netanyahu saw a shift from initial sympathy to isolation due to deteriorating conditions in Gaza. By March 2024, he faced a rift with US President Joe Biden over a planned offensive in Rafah, an area with a large concentration of civilians.</p>

<p>Domestic unrest grew as protests intensified in Tel Aviv by late May. On May 20, 2024, the International Criminal Court announced plans to seek arrest warrants for Benjamin Netanyahu, Defence Minister Yoav Gallant and Hamas leaders for alleged war crimes.</p>

<p>This decision drew condemnation, though Netanyahu's public support rose slightly.</p>

<p>In July 2024, Netanyahu insisted that any ceasefire must allow Israel to retain control over the Philadelphi Corridor between Gaza and Egypt, viewing it as critical to cutting off Hamas's supplies. This became a sticking point in negotiations.</p>

<p>By the end of August, the discovery of the bodies of six hostages escalated public anger, triggering massive protests. The protesters demanded the Netanyahu government to prioritise the release of remaining hostages. Despite growing pressure, Netanyahu maintained his stance on controlling the Philadelphi Corridor.</p>

<p>Israel is also fighting a war with Hamas ally Hezbollah in Lebanon. The two sides had exchanged rocket fire since the October 7 attack. The Benjamin Netanyahu government decided to send ground troops to Lebanon in September.</p>

<p>The situation in the Middle East remains very tense with the world eagerly watching Benjamin Neyanyahu's next step.</p>

<p>The killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, the mastermind of the October 7 attacks, has significantly boosted Benjamin Netanyahu's image within Israel but it may escalate tension in the Middle East.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[New research published in iScience reveals that cats possess body-size awareness, particularly when navigating narrow openings.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cats and dogs have long been cherished as some of the most popular pets worldwide, admired for their companionship, loyalty, and distinct personalities. These creatures continue to improve the lives of families all around the world, whether it's because of the independent appeal of cats or the devoted character of dogs.</p>

<p>Cat owners are aware that their animals move differently from other pets. Cats are often characterised as "liquid," as if their bodies just spilt into any place they happened to inhabit. Many pet owners have been amazed by this fluid-like action, and it appears that cats are aware of their amazing skill, as they frequently display a smug demeanour while doing so.</p>

<p>Cats are cherished pets for more reasons than just their fluid motions. Their personalities, which are frequently marked by humour and independence, make them enticing company. Whether it's the grace or loyalty of a dog, these pets never fail to win people over and deepen the relationship that exists between people and animals.</p>

<p>According to the new research that has been published in<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(24)02024-8?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS2589004224020248%3Fshowall%3Dtrue"><em> iScience,</em></a> cats selectively rely on body size awareness when negotiating short openings.</p>

<p>According to the author of the research paper, various animal species can make a priori decisions about the passability of openings based on their own size knowledge. So far, no one has tested the ability for self-representation in cats. We hypothesised that cats may rely on their size awareness when they have to negotiate small openings.</p>

<p>Companion cats were tested with incrementally decreasing-sized openings, which were either the same height or the same width. Cats approached and entered even the narrowest openings, but they slowed down before reaching and while passing through the shortest ones.</p>

<p>Because of their specific anatomical features and cautious locomotory strategy, cats readily opt for the trial-and-error method to negotiate narrow apertures, but they seemingly rely on their body-size representing capacity in the case of uncomfortably short openings. Ecologically valid methodologies can provide answers in the future as to whether cats would rely on their body awareness in other challenging spatial tasks, the authors of the study wrote.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Is there life on Mars? Scientists have been seeking an answer to this question for a long time. Although no concrete evidence has been found till date, a latest study by NASA has sparked curiosity. The US space agency suggests that microbes might find a potential home beneath the frozen water on the red planet's surface.</p>

<p>Based on computer modelling, the authors of the study have discovered that the amount of sunlight that penetrates the water ice could be enough for photosynthesis to occur in the shallow pools of meltwater beneath the surface of that ice.</p>

<p>The process of photosynthesis is utilised by plants and other organisms for converting light energy into chemical energy in search of food.</p>

<p>On the Earth, similar pools of water that form within ice are found to teem with life, including algae, fungi, and microscopic cyanobacteria -- all of them derive energy from photosynthesis.</p>

<p><strong>What does the study suggest?</strong></p>

<p>The NASA research was led by Aditya Khuller, who is associated with the space agency's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Southern California. The paper was published in Nature Communications Earth &amp; Environment.</p>

<p>"If we're trying to find life anywhere in the universe today, Martian ice exposures are probably one of the most accessible places we should be looking," Khuller said.</p>

<p>Since Mars has two kinds of ice -- frozen water and frozen carbon dioxide -- the research team looked at the water ice as a potential host of life.</p>

<p>Tracing its origin, the researchers said that large amounts of it had formed from snow mixed with dust which had fallen on the surface during a series of Martian ice ages in the past million years. The ancient snow, which has now solidified into ice, is still peppered with specks of dust, it added.</p>

<p>Even though these dust particles may obscure light in the ice's deeper layers, they hold the key to explaining how subsurface pools of water could form within ice after getting exposed to the Sun.</p>

<p>"Dark dust absorbs more sunlight than the surrounding ice, potentially causing the ice to warm up and melt up to a few feet below the surface," NASA states.</p>

<p>The study's co-author, Phil Christensen of Arizona State University in Tempe, has been studying ice on Mars for the past few decades.</p>

<p>"Dense snow and ice can melt from the inside out, letting in sunlight that warms it like a greenhouse, rather than melting from the top down," he said.</p>

<p>Aditya Khuller and his team now hope to re-create some of Mars' dusty ice in a lab to study it closely.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>North Korea's decision to deploy thousands of soldiers to Ukraine's front lines cements Pyongyang's contentious military alliance with Moscow, experts told AFP, and pulls Russia deeper into Korean peninsula security.</p>

<p>About 1,500 North Korean special forces soldiers are already in Russia acclimatising, likely to head to the front lines soon, Seoul's spy agency said Friday, with thousands more troops set to depart imminently, Pyongyang's first such deployment overseas.</p>

<p>The move demonstrates that the military deal signed by the North's Kim Jong Un and Russian President Vladimir Putin in June, which included a mutual defence clause, was not just for show.</p>

<p>"This establishes a framework where Russia's intervention or military support will automatically occur if North Korea is attacked or faces a crisis," Hong Min, a senior analyst at the Korea Institute for National Unification, told AFP.</p>

<p>The fact that North Korean soldiers will fight alongside Russia in Ukraine proves how "solid" the Putin-Kim deal really is, Hong said.</p>

<p>And the boost of troops from Pyongyang could help Moscow to hold "occupied territories or aid in further territorial gains", he added.</p>

<p>North and South Korea remain technically at war as the 1950 to 1953 conflict ended with an armistice, not a peace deal. But while Kim has built up a nuclear arsenal, Seoul lacks nukes of its own.</p>

<p>The South is protected by the so-called US nuclear umbrella, and Seoul and Washington routinely conduct large-scale joint military drills, which infuriate Pyongyang.</p>

<p>By sending troops to Russia, Kim could be hoping to create a more integrated North Korean and Russian military deterrent, akin to the US-South Korea alliance, potentially "resulting in a significant shift" in the Koreas' security dynamics, Hong said.</p>

<p><strong>'Significant shift'</strong></p>

<p>Ukraine's state-run Centre for Strategic Communication on Friday released a video that purportedly shows North Korean soldiers in what looks like a Russian military camp preparing to join Moscow's war in Ukraine.</p>

<p>In the footage, one of the soldiers appeared to say "move over" to his colleagues with a North Korean accent.</p>

<p>Seoul's spy agency told AFP that it was "inappropriate" for them to comment on materials released by another country's government.</p>

<p>Experts said the deployment gives North Korea's elite soldiers a chance to experience modern warfare, and see how the country's home-grown weaponry -- which Seoul has long accused Kim of sending to Russia -- fares on the battlefield.</p>

<p>It could also be a bid by Kim to enhance his international stature and negotiating position ahead of the US elections next month, Lee Sang-min, a researcher at Korea Institute for Defense Analyses, told AFP.</p>

<p>"One way to attract global attention by doing something reprehensible is by sending troops to support the war in Ukraine, which could prolong the conflict or shift it in Russia's favour," he said.</p>

<p><strong>War economy</strong></p>

<p>For Russia, the benefit of the North Korean deployment is clear, said Vladimir Tikhonov, professor of Korea studies at the University of Oslo.</p>

<p>"Russia's main bottleneck is shortage of both military and labour manpower, and North Korea has a great unexplored potential to alleviate both," he told AFP.</p>

<p>Relations between the two Koreas are at one of their lowest points in years, with Kim on Thursday stressing the country had jettisoned the "unreasonable idea of reunification".</p>

<p>Experts said Pyongyang could also be using Ukraine as a means of re-aligning its foreign policy.</p>

<p>By sending soldiers, North Korea is positioning itself within the Russian war economy as a supplier of weapons, military support and labour -- potentially even bypassing its traditional ally, neighbour and main trading partner, China, according to analysts.</p>

<p>"It means that Pyongyang won't be motivated to seek improvements in relations with Japan, South Korea and the US," Tikhonov said.</p>

<p>"It means a constant state of tension on the Korean Peninsula."</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Slain Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar was seen as a key obstacle to any agreement on the Israeli hostages seized during the October 7 attack that he orchestrated.</p>

<p>With his group plunged into a leadership vacuum by his death, the future of hostage negotiations appears to have become even more complicated.</p>

<p>Hamas now needs to appoint a replacement, and that person will play a key role in determining the fate of the Israelis kept hostage since its attack on October 7, 2023.</p>

<p>Of the 251 hostages taken to the Gaza Strip that day, 97 are still being held there, including 34 who the Israeli army has confirmed are dead.</p>

<p>Negotiations for their release are led by Israel's intelligence services, with the help of the United States, Egypt and Qatar.</p>

<p>But that task will be no easier with Sinwar gone, analysts said.</p>

<p>"The hostages' fate may now be sealed for the simple reason that there is no one left to negotiate their release," said Karim Mezran, a Middle East expert at the Atlantic Council think tank.</p>

<p>US intelligence believed "Sinwar's stance had hardened in recent weeks, leading American negotiators to believe that Hamas was no longer interested in reaching a ceasefire or hostage agreement," said the New York-based Soufan Center.</p>

<p>So "any forthcoming negotiations can also serve as a litmus test for Hamas's operational capacity in the post-Sinwar era," the think tank added.</p>

<p>While the families of the hostages welcomed Sinwar's killing, they also expressed "deep concern" about those still held captive.</p>

<p>"We call on the Israeli government, world leaders, and mediating countries to leverage the military achievement into a diplomatic one by pursuing an immediate agreement for the release," the Hostages and Missing Persons Families Forum said on Friday.</p>

<p><strong>Hamas 'decentralised'</strong></p>

<p>Part of the problem lies in how Hamas is no longer the ultra-hierarchical organisation it was when it carried out the October 7 attack which sparked the Gaza war.</p>

<p>Decimated and scattered by Israel's offensive, and with the Gaza Strip cleaved in two by the Israeli army, today the militant group "operates in very localised cells, in a much more decentralised way", researcher David Khalfa at the Fondation Jean-Jaures think tank told AFP.</p>

<p>Hamas "is now more of a militia with local warlords" that has links with "families which apparently are holding hostages", he said.</p>

<p>That "is going to be a real problem for the Israelis and the Americans. Rather than a blanket agreement on the hostages, they will probably aim for releases bit by bit," Khalfa said.</p>

<p>Until the middle of 2024, Hamas's structure was split in two: on the one hand, the political branch led by Ismail Haniyeh, based in the Qatari capital Doha, and the paramilitary branch led by Sinwar in Gaza on the other.</p>

<p>Sinwar rose to become the overall leader of Hamas after Haniyeh was assassinated in July.</p>

<p>The balance of power between the two is now tilted towards the political bureau, "where the sources of funding, logistical support and militia training are concentrated", Khalfa said.</p>

<p>If it chooses a leader in exile, the group runs the risk of seeing its new chief alienated from its forces on the ground in the Palestinian territories.</p>

<p>But if it appoints a fighter such as Sinwar's brother Mohammed, Hamas will be signalling it has less interest in a political resolution to the war.</p>

<p><strong>'Much murkier' picture</strong></p>

<p>Hostage negotiations are now in unchartered territory.</p>

<p>"Prior negotiating efforts were all based on the idea that Sinwar had a line of connection to most of those holding hostages, and he could shape their actions," Jon Alterman of the US think tank CSIS said.</p>

<p>"The picture is much murkier now, and we are likely to see a diverse array of outcomes," he said.</p>

<p>There are even fears the hostages could be executed, perhaps in revenge for Sinwar's killing or because the militants feel they can no longer sell the hostages for cash.</p>

<p>With no one in the group "willing to take the deadly risk of looking after them... the hostages may be left to their own devices and able to escape," Mezran said.</p>

<p>"The fear is also that mid-level Hamas operatives may be tempted to eliminate the hostages to protect their own identities from the eventual retaliation of Israeli forces."</p>

<p>The pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is enormous, but his government does not appear prepared to secure the hostages' release at any price.</p>

<p>It will not have forgotten the 2011 release of more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners in exchange for Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit, held hostage by Hamas for five years.</p>

<p>Among the Palestinians freed was Sinwar himself.</p>

<p>"They want to get away from the Shalit precedent, which was a mistake they paid a high price for," Khalfa said.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Young professionals in Japan are seeking help from specialised agencies to quit their jobs. The phenomenon, known as proxy resignation, is quite popular in the country.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Young professionals in Japan are seeking help from specialised agencies to quit their jobs.&nbsp;Momuri, a Tokyo-based agency, has reported a major spike in demand ever since it began offering proxy resignation services more than two years ago.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Shinji Tanimoto, the head of Albatross, the firm that runs Momuri, told The Guardian that they submit resignations on people's behalf as they are unable to do so for whatever reasons.</p>

<p dir="ltr">In Japanese, Momuri means "enough already".</p>

<p dir="ltr">"Sometimes it's just natural reluctance, but some might have experienced harassment or even violence from their employers. They are at their wits' end when they come to us," the official said.</p>

<p dir="ltr">At present, Momuri is among the estimated 100 companies that offer similar services across Japan. It has received a total of 350,000 online consultations and went on to complete 20,000 resignations.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>How does it work?</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">For this service, people usually get in touch with these agencies via popular messaging apps. In the case of Momuri, clients have to first complete a questionnaire and then sign a contract, besides paying the fee of ¥22,000 (roughly ₹12,344) for full-time workers and ¥12,300 (around ₹6,900) for part-time employees as well as those working on fixed-term contracts.</p>

<p dir="ltr">On behalf of the client, one of Momuri's staff calls the employer. The entire process, starting with the initial consultation to resignation, usually takes 20-30 minutes.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Why are people leaving jobs?</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">Surprisingly, 60% of the Momuri users are those people, who are in their 20s. As per Japan's labour ministry, over 30% of the recent graduates in the country are leaving their jobs within three years.</p>

<p dir="ltr">If experts are to be believed then this growing trend is due to a generational shift in people's attitude towards work that has been accelerated by the disruption to jobs as well as the lifestyles caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Labour shortage in Japan -- a symptom of its low birthrate -- has further made employers more determined towards retaining the staff members, even when it requires intimidating them into staying back. Also, there have been instances when they have allegedly forced workers to hunt for their own replacements before accepting their resignations.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Mynavi, an employment information provider in Japan, said that one in six workers in the country took help from resignation agencies to switch to another company in the 12 months period, till June this year.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kamala Harris and Donald Trump will roll out starkly contrasting celebrity back-up this weekend in Pennsylvania and Michigan -– among the most prized of the battleground states set to decide the tightest of US presidential races.</p>

<p>Pop star Lizzo will throw multi-Grammy award winning glitter behind the vice president's campaign in Detroit, while the world's richest man Elon Musk is to stump for Trump in Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>Harris will also be joined by R&amp;B star Usher at a get-out-the-vote rally in Atlanta, Georgia, on Saturday.</p>

<p>Both candidates are fighting on every front to seal up voters' support in a race that polls suggest is effectively tied with fewer than three weeks to Election Day.</p>

<p>Musk, who endorsed Trump in July, is one of President Joe Biden administration's fiercest critics and has emerged as a loud voice in US politics since taking over Twitter, now known as X. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The Tesla and SpaceX CEO has taken an increasingly visible role in Trump's campaign and has donated almost $75 million to his political organization America PAC.</p>

<p>Harris has deployed high-wattage surrogates, from ex-president Barack Obama to Megan Thee Stallion since replacing Biden as the Democratic nominee in July.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Early voting underway</strong></p>

<p>Seeking to shift the polls in a desperately tight White House race, Harris has ramped up attacks on the mental fitness of the 78-year-old, who is the oldest presidential candidate in US history.</p>

<p>She questioned his ability to be president after Trump faced speculation that he is "exhausted" after backing out of a spate of interviews.</p>

<p>Politico reported that a Trump aide had told producers at a website negotiating an interview that the ex-president was "exhausted" and refusing some appearances -- a claim described by his campaign as "detached from reality."</p>

<p>Beyond the accusations, both candidates are spending their final campaign days in pivotal battleground states where early voting is already underway.</p>

<p>With less than three weeks to go, Harris has seen encouraging signs in her push for supporters to vote as soon as possible, as a bulwark against the traditional Republican edge among Election Day voters.</p>

<p>Almost 12 million votes had been cast by Friday evening -- around a third of them in the seven swing states expected to decide the election -- according to data tracked by the University of Florida Election Lab.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Georgia has been smashing records, while North Carolina reported a first day of voting Thursday that beat 2020, when there was a pandemic-linked surge in early ballots.</p>

<p>Where party breakdowns were available, registered Democrats accounted for roughly half of the total, while Republicans -- who have spent much of the Trump era casting aspersions over drop boxes and mailed ballots -- were responsible for around a third.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A drone was launched towardsIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's residence in the Israeli town of Caesarea.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A drone was launched towards&nbsp;Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's residence in the Israeli town of Caesarea on Saturday, days after Hamas leader <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/yahya-sinwar-israel-hamas-small-ugly-broken-israel-soldiers-time-alone-with-yahya-sinwars-body-6822794">Yahya Sinwar was killed</a>.</p>

<p>Mr Netanyahu's spokesperson said he was not in the vicinity and there were no casualties in the attack on his residence.&nbsp;"A UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) was launched toward the prime minister's residence in Caesarea. The prime minister and his wife were not at the location, and there were no injuries in the incident," the prime minister's office said in a statement.</p>

<p>Earlier, the Israeli military had said that the drone was launched from Lebanon and it had hit a building.&nbsp;Two more drones that crossed into Israeli territory were intercepted, the military was quoted as saying by Reuters.</p>

<p>The drone attack was not immediately claimed by Hezbollah, which has been trading fire with Israel since last October, or any other militant group.</p>

<p>Israel is also fighting a war with Hamas ally Hezbollah in Lebanon. The two sides had exchanged rocket fire since the October 7 attack, with Israel sending ground troops across the Lebanese border last month.</p>

<p>The drone attack comes a day after&nbsp;the Israeli military said it had destroyed Hezbollah's regional command centre with an air strike.&nbsp;Since late September, the war has left at least 1,418 people dead in Lebanon, according to an AFP tally of Lebanese health ministry figures, though the real toll is likely higher.</p>

<p>Meanwhile,&nbsp;Lebanese authorities said two people were killed in an Israeli strike on Saturday in Jounieh, north of Beirut, in the first strike on the area since Hezbollah and Israel started trading fire last year.&nbsp;The health ministry said an "Israeli enemy raid" hit a car in Jounieh, with Lebanese state media saying the attack occurred on a key highway linking the capital to the country's north.</p>

<p>The tripartite conflict in Middle East is likely to see further intensification after Sinwar was killed in an Israeli operation in southern Gaza. <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/from-studying-in-prison-to-heading-hamas-oct-7-attack-who-was-yahya-sinwar-6817331">Sinwar, the mastermind</a> of the October 7 attacks&nbsp;which killed over 1,200 Israelis and brought more than 250 hostages into Gaza, took over as <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/who-will-replace-yahya-sinwar-these-top-hamas-leaders-are-in-contention-6815803">head of Hamas</a> after the killing of its leader Ismail Haniyeh in the Iranian capital Tehran.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Vikas Yadav, a former Indian government employee on the Federal Bureau of Investigation's wanted list, was arrested ten months ago by the Delhi Police on charges of attempted murder and kidnapping.</p>

<p>The former officer of the Research and Analysis Wing (R&amp;AW) has been charged by US prosecutors for his alleged role in directing a failed plot to kill Khalistani terrorist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, who holds dual citizenship of the US and Canada. The Ministry of External Affairs on Thursday confirmed that the individual named in the US Justice Department's indictment was "no longer an employee of the government of India".</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="http://www.ndtv.com/world-news/ndtv-explains-gurpatwant-singh-pannun-murder-for-hire-case-ex-spy-vikash-yadav-drug-smuggler-nikhil-gupta-plot-to-kill-khalistani-terrorist-6816220">Vikas Yadav</a>, also known as Vikash Yadav, was arrested by the special cell of Delhi Police in December last year after a complaint by a businessman from Rohini in north west Delhi and a chargesheet was filed in March this year. Yadav got bail a month later in April.</p>

<p>The businessman - who is said to have many contacts in west Asia - told police that his acquaintance had introduced him to Vikas Yadav in November 2023 and told him that he was a senior government officer. They soon shared mobile numbers to stay in touch.</p>

<p>According to the complaint, Yadav often asked him about his work and friends. The former government employee had also told him that he worked as an undercover agent. But, he never shared any information about his work and office, the businessman told the police.</p>

<p>On December 11, Yadav called him and said that he wanted to discuss some issue and asked him to come to Lodhi Road, as per the complaint. There was another man with Yadav when he reached the location. The businessman claimed that they forcibly kidnapped him and took him to a flat in Defence Colony, where Yadav told him that gangster Lawrence Bishnoi had given him a contract to kill him.</p>

<p>Yadav's associate then hit him on the head and took away his gold chain and rings, he alleged, adding they went to his cafe and took whatever cash was there. According to the complainant, they left him on the side of a road and threatened him with a dire outcome if he complained to anyone.</p>

<p>The businessman soon went to the police and a First Information Report or FIR was filed in the case under the sections of attempt to murder, criminal conspiracy and kidnapping. Yadav and his associate were arrested on December 18.</p>

<p>During interrogation, the associate told the police that he joined the conspiracy with Vikas Yadav as he had suffered losses in his business of old vehicles. He said that Yadav told him that his father was in the Border Security Force.</p>

<p>Vikas Yadav said that he planned the whole crime the day he met the businessman. Delhi Police filed a case in March, and Vikas got bail in April. Although Vikas got interim bail on March 22, but then he got regular bail in April.</p>

<p><strong>US' Charges Against Vikas Yadav</strong></p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/ex-indian-spy-charged-in-us-over-alleged-khalistani-terrorist-murder-plot-report-6815072">Vikas Yadav</a> faces three charges: conspiracy to hire a hitman, the actual "murder-for-hire" plot, and money laundering. The charges against him and his alleged co-conspirator Nikhil Gupta, were unsealed in the Federal Southern District of New York Court on Thursday.</p>

<p>According to the indictment, Yadav was the alleged mastermind who recruited Gupta to carry out the plot in exchange for helping him get criminal cases against him dismissed. Nikhil Gupta was arrested in the Czech Republic and was extradited to the US in June.</p>

<p>Many of the details in the document repeat the same narratives made in earlier documents filed against Gupta, but this time, Yadav is identified by name.</p>

<p>"Yadav recruited Gupta to orchestrate the assassination of the Victim in the United States and that under Yadav's directions, Gupta contacted a government "confidential source" who he thought was "a criminal associate," it said.</p>

<p>As per the document, the alleged plot began around May 6 last year with Yadav sending Gupta a message on an encrypted app, "This is Vikas ... save my name as Aman".</p>

<p>In June 2023, they hired a "hitman" and agreed on a payment of $100,000 to allegedly kill the "victim", the court document which did not name Pannun said. Yadav and Gupta arranged through an "associate of Yadav" to give $15,000 as advance.</p>

<p>The plot, however, unravelled as the "hitman" they hired was an undercover US law enforcement officer, according to the 18-page court document, which also included a photograph of Yadav dressed in military fatigues.</p>

<p>The charges were filed a day after an Indian Enquiry Committee set up to investigate the allegations visited Washington to discuss the case with US officials.</p>

<p>In November last year, US federal prosecutors charged Nikhil Gupta of working with an Indian government employee in the foiled plot to kill Pannun in New York.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Its not surprising that technology regulation is an important issue in the 2024 US presidential campaign.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="theconversation-article-title">It's not surprising that technology regulation is an important issue in the 2024 US presidential campaign.</p>

<div class="theconversation-article-body">
<p>The past decade has seen advanced technologies, from social media algorithms to large language model artificial intelligence systems, profoundly affect society. These changes, which spanned the Trump and Biden-Harris administrations, spurred calls for the federal government to regulate the technologies and the powerful corporations that wield them.</p>

<p>As <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=JpFHYKcAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">a researcher of information systems and AI</a>, I examined both candidates' records on technology regulation. Here are the important differences.</p>

<h3><strong>Algorithmic harms</strong></h3>

<p>With artificial intelligence now widespread, governments worldwide are grappling with how to <a href="https://iapp.org/resources/article/global-ai-legislation-tracker/">regulate various aspects of the technology</a>. The candidates <a href="https://www.voanews.com/a/how-harris-and-trump-differ-on-artificial-intelligence-policy/7718185.html">offer different visions</a> for U.S. AI policy. One area where there is a stark difference is in recognizing and addressing algorithmic harms from the widespread use of AI technology.</p>

<p>AI affects your life in ways that <a href="https://theconversation.com/forget-dystopian-scenarios-ai-is-pervasive-today-and-the-risks-are-often-hidden-218222">might escape your notice</a>. Biases in algorithms <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/algorithmic-bias-detection-and-mitigation-best-practices-and-policies-to-reduce-consumer-harms/#footnote-23">used for lending</a> and hiring decisions could end up <a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250215789/automatinginequality">reinforcing a vicious cycle of discrimination</a>. For example, a student who can't get a loan for college would then be less likely to get the education needed to <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/241363/weapons-of-math-destruction-by-cathy-oneil/">pull herself out of poverty</a>. At the AI Safety Summit in the UK in November 2023, Harris spoke of the promise of AI but also the perils of <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2023/11/01/remarks-by-vice-president-harris-on-the-future-of-artificial-intelligence-london-united-kingdom/">algorithmic bias, deepfakes and wrongful arrests</a>. Biden <a href="https://theconversation.com/biden-administration-executive-order-tackles-ai-risks-but-lack-of-privacy-laws-limits-reach-216694">signed an executive order on AI</a> on Oct. 30, 2023, that recognized AI systems can pose unacceptable risks of harm to civil and human rights and individual well-being. In parallel, federal agencies such as the Federal Trade Commission <a href="https://theconversation.com/ftc-probe-of-openai-consumer-protection-is-the-opening-salvo-of-us-ai-regulation-209821">have carried out enforcement actions</a> to guard against algorithmic harms.&nbsp;</p>

<p>By contrast, the Trump administration did not take a public stance on mitigation of algorithmic harms. Trump has said he <a href="https://apnews.com/article/ai-artificial-intelligence-kamala-harris-trump-vance-1c94ba2ee6a1410e61d980faa51b19e4">wants to repeal President Biden's AI executive order</a>. In recent interviews, however, Trump noted the dangers of technologies such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1N_Gdo6tABo">deepfakes and challenges posed to security</a> from AI systems, suggesting a willingness to engage with the growing risks from AI.</p>

<h3><strong>Technological standards</strong></h3>

<p>The Trump administration signed the <a href="https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/ai/executive-order-ai/">American AI Initiative executive order</a> on Feb. 11, 2019. The order pledged to double AI research investment and established the first set of national AI research institutes. The order also included a <a href="https://www.nist.gov/system/files/documents/2019/08/10/ai_standards_fedengagement_plan_9aug2019.pdf">plan for AI technical standards</a> and established guidance for the federal government's use of AI. Trump also signed an executive order on Dec. 3, 2020, <a href="https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-promoting-use-trustworthy-artificial-intelligence-federal-government/">promoting the use of trustworthy AI in the federal government</a>.</p>

<p>The Biden-Harris administration has tried to go further. Harris convened the heads of Google, Microsoft and other tech companies at the White House on May 4, 2023, to undertake <a href="https://apnews.com/article/ai-artificial-intelligence-kamala-harris-trump-vance-1c94ba2ee6a1410e61d980faa51b19e4">a set of voluntary commitments</a> to safeguard individual rights. The Biden administration's <a href="https://theconversation.com/biden-administration-executive-order-tackles-ai-risks-but-lack-of-privacy-laws-limits-reach-216694">executive order contains an important initiative to probe the vulnerability</a> of very large-scale, general-purpose AI models trained on massive amounts of data. The goal is to determine the risks hackers pose to these models, including the ones that power OpenAI's popular ChatGPT and DALL-E.</p>

<h3><strong>Antitrust</strong></h3>

<p>Antitrust law enforcement – restricting or conditioning mergers and acquisitions – is another way the federal government regulates the technology industry.</p>

<p>The Trump administration's antitrust dossier <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2017/11/20/trump-lawsuit-att-time-warner-merger-250956">includes its attempt to block AT&amp;T's acquisition of Time Warner</a>. The merger was eventually <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2018/06/12/att-time-warner-merger-approved-642333">allowed by a federal judge</a> after the FTC under the Trump administration filed a suit to block the deal. The Trump administration <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/10/20/justice-department-antitrust-case-google-430281">also filed an antitrust case against Google</a> focused on its dominance in internet search.</p>

<p>Biden <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/07/09/executive-order-on-promoting-competition-in-the-american-economy/">signed an executive order</a> on July 9, 2021, to enforce antitrust laws arising from the anticompetitive effects of dominant internet platforms. The order also targeted the acquisition of nascent competitors, the aggregation of data, unfair competition in attention markets and the surveillance of users. The Biden-Harris administration has filed antitrust cases against <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/03/22/ai-apple-biden-antitrust-suit">Apple and Google</a>.</p>

<p>The Biden-Harris administration's <a href="https://www.investors.com/news/technology/big-tech-antitrust-crackdown-2024-presidential-election/">merger guidelines in 2023</a> outlined rules to determine when mergers can be considered anticompetitive. While both administrations filed antitrust cases, the Biden administration's antitrust push appears stronger in terms of its impact in potentially reorganizing or <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/09/09/biden-administration-google-antitrust-00177843">even orchestrating a breakup</a> of dominant companies such as Google.</p>

<h3><strong>Cryptocurrency</strong></h3>

<p>The candidates have different approaches to cryptocurrency regulation. Late in his administration, Trump tweeted <a href="https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2019/08/06/a-roadmap-for-president-trumps-crypto-crackdown/">in support of cryptocurrency regulation</a>. Also late in Trump's administration, the federal Financial Crimes Enforcement Network <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm1216">proposed regulations</a> that would have required financial firms to collect the identity of <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/05/30/trump-crypto-bitcoin-nfts">any cryptocurrency wallet to which a user sent funds</a>. The regulations were not enacted.</p>

<p>Trump has since shifted his position on cryptocurrencies. He has criticized <a href="https://theconversation.com/make-bitcoin-great-again-what-donald-trumps-backing-of-crypto-could-mean-for-the-industry-235988">existing US laws</a> and <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/09/25/nx-s1-5056183/trump-has-a-pro-cryptocurrency-platform-while-harris-chases-the-crypto-vote">called for the United States to be a Bitcoin superpower</a>. The Trump campaign is the first presidential campaign to <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/91156274/bitcoin-crypto-rise-after-trump-shooting">accept payments in cryptocurrencies</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/crypto-community-divided-over-kamala-070903707.html">Biden-Harris administration</a>, by contrast, has laid out regulatory restrictions on cryptocurrencies with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which brought about <a href="https://www.cornerstone.com/insights/reports/sec-cryptocurrency-enforcement/">a series of enforcement actions</a>. The <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/house-representatives-vote-biden-veto-overturn-sec-rule">White House vetoed</a> the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act that aimed to clarify accounting for cryptocurrencies, a bill <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/house-representatives-vote-biden-veto-overturn-sec-rule">favored by the cryptocurrency industry</a>.</p>

<h3><strong>Data privacy</strong></h3>

<p>Biden's AI <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/10/30/executive-order-on-the-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-development-and-use-of-artificial-intelligence/">executive order</a> calls on Congress to adopt privacy legislation, but it does not provide a legislative framework to do so. The Trump White House's American AI Initiative <a href="https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/ai/executive-order-ai/">executive order</a> mentions privacy only in broad terms, calling for AI technologies to uphold “<a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2019/02/14/2019-02544/maintaining-american-leadership-in-artificial-intelligence">civil liberties, privacy, and American values</a>.” The order did not mention how existing privacy protections would be enforced.</p>

<p>Across the US, several states have tried to pass legislation addressing aspects of data privacy. At present, there is a patchwork of statewide initiatives and a lack of <a href="https://www.dataguidance.com/jurisdiction/usa-federal">comprehensive data privacy legislation</a> at the federal level.</p>

<p>The paucity of federal data privacy protections is a stark reminder that while the candidates are addressing some of the challenges posed by developments in AI and technology more broadly, a lot still remains to be done to regulate technology in the public interest.</p>

<p>Overall, the Biden administration's efforts at antitrust and technology regulation seem broadly aligned with the goal of reining in technology companies and protecting consumers. It's also reimagining monopoly protections for the 21st century. This seems to be the chief difference between the two administrations.<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Turkey has formally asked to join the BRICS group of emerging-market nations as it seeks to bolster its global influence and forge new ties beyond its traditional Western allies, according to people familiar with the matter.</p>

<p>The view of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's administration is that the geopolitical center of gravity is shifting away from developed economies, according to the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they aren't authorized to comment.</p>

<p>The country's new diplomatic push reflects its aspirations to cultivate ties with all sides in a multipolar world, while still fulfilling its obligations as a key member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, they said.</p>

<p>Straddling Europe and Asia, Turkey submitted an application to join BRICS some months ago amid frustration over a lack of progress in its decades-old bid to join the European Union, the people added. The bid is also partly a result of rifts with fellow NATO members after Turkey maintained close links with Russia following its invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the people added. Turkey's foreign ministry and presidency declined to comment.</p>

<p>"Turkey can become a strong, prosperous, prestigious and effective country if it improves its relations with the East and the West simultaneously," Erdogan said in Istanbul over the weekend. "Any method other than this will not benefit Turkey, but will harm it."</p>

<p>The BRICS grouping, named after Brazil, Russia, India and China and South Africa, includes some of the biggest emerging economies. It got four new members at the start of this year when Iran, the United Arab Emirates, Ethiopia and Egypt joined its ranks. Saudi Arabia was invited to join, though the kingdom is yet to do that.</p>

<p>The group's further enlargement could be discussed during a summit in Kazan, Russia, from Oct. 22-24, said the people. Malaysia, Thailand and Turkey's close ally Azerbaijan are among other countries looking to join.</p>

<p>The BRICS touts itself as an alternative to what its members see as Western-dominated institutions such as the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. New members can potentially get access to financing through its development bank as well as broaden their political and trading relationships.</p>

<p>Erdogan's ruling Justice and Development Party has long accused Western nations of thwarting Turkish aspirations for a self-sufficient defense industry and strong economy. The president has repeatedly called for an overhaul of the United Nations Security Council to broaden its five permanent members, and expressed interest in joining the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, set up by Russia and China as a rival to NATO.</p>

<p>"We do not have to choose between the European Union and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization as some people claim," Erdogan said. "On the contrary, we have to develop our relations with both these and other organizations on a win-win basis."</p>

<p>BRICS expansion has largely been driven by China, which is trying to boost its global clout by courting nations traditionally allied with the US.</p>

<p>Turkey has been in talks to join the EU since 2005, but has encountered a series of obstacles, including what that bloc describes as the country's democratic shortcomings.</p>

<p>Turkey believes joining the BRICS could help the country improve economic cooperation with Russia and China, and become a trade conduit between the EU and Asia. It wants to be a hub for gas exports out of Russia and Central Asia, the people said.</p>

<p>Erdogan's administration has been trying to lure investment from Chinese electric carmakers, which could potentially take advantage of Turkey's customs union with the EU to boost their market access.</p>

<p>"BRICS is an organization that increases the diversity of approaches, identities and politics in the global economic system," Turkey's Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said after attending a BRICS foreign ministers meeting in June.</p>

<p>Still, Turkey is making parallel efforts to rejuvenate membership talks with the EU. That remains "a strategic target," Fidan said last week after attending informal talks with EU counterparts for the first time in five years.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Shots were reportedly fired outside Punjabi singer AP Dhillon's house on Victoria Island in Canada's Vancouver. The incident took place yesterday and a man named Rohit Godara, a member of the Lawrence Bishnoi gang, has reportedly taken responsibility for the incident.</p>

<p>A video, which can not be independently verified, shows a man standing outside a house firing multiple shots at night. The video is being circulated on the internet but the location remains unverified.</p>

<p>AP Dhillon lives on Victoria Island in British Columbia.</p>

<p>A purported post is being circulated where the gangster, Rohit Godara, is claiming that the firing took place at two locations in Canada - Victoria Island and Woodbridge Toronto. According to the post, he fired outside the singer's house after he featured Salman Khan in a music video. He also gave death threats to the singer in the purported post. The gangster claims he is associated with Lawrence Bishnoi.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="ins_instory_dv_caption">Shots being fired outside a house in Canada</p>
</div>

<p>Security agencies are verifying the claims made in the post and analysing the video. The singer is yet to respond to the incident. The police in Canada have not responded to the incident.&nbsp;</p>

<p>AP Dhillon is known for blending the 80s-style synth-pop with Punjabi music. His rise on the global canvas has been meteoric owing to songs like 'Brown Munde', 'Excuses', 'Summer High', 'With You', 'Dil Nu', and 'Insane', among others.</p>

<p>In November last year, gangster Lawrence Bishnoi claimed responsibility for a purported shooting at singer Gippy Grewal's house in Canada. The alleged incident took place in the White Rock neighbourhood in Vancouver.</p>

<p>In April, two motorcycle-borne persons opened fire outside Khan's residence at the Galaxy Apartment in Mumbai's Bandra area and fled the spot. The Mumbai police declared jailed gangster Lawrence Bishnoi and his younger brother Anmol Bishnoi as "wanted accused" in connection with the incident.</p>

<p>Last year, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) said that Mr Khan topped the list of 10 main targets that jailed gangster Lawrence Bishnoi planned to eliminate, citing the actor's infamous 1998 black buck hunting incident, which according to the gangster, offended the Bishnoi community.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Toddlers should not be allowed to watch screens at all, Sweden told parents on Monday.</p>

<p>Children under the age of two should be kept away from digital media and television completely, the country's Public Health Agency said.</p>

<p>Kids between the ages of two and five should be limited to a maximum of one hour of screen time a day, it said in new recommendations, while those aged six to 12 should spend no more than an hour or two a day in front of a screen.</p>

<p>Teenagers aged 13 to 18 should be limited to two to three hours per day, the agency said.</p>

<p>"For too long, smartphones and other screens have been allowed to enter every aspect of our children's lives," Public Health Minister Jakob Forssmed told reporters.</p>

<p>The minister said that Swedish teens aged 13 to 16 spend six and a half hours a day on average in front of their screens, outside of school hours.</p>

<p>Forssmed said that didn't leave "a lot of time for communal activities, physical activity or adequate sleep", and lamented a Swedish "sleep crisis" noting that more than half of 15-year-olds did not get enough sleep.</p>

<p>The health agency also recommended that kids not use screens before going to bed and that phones and tablets be kept out of bedroom at night.</p>

<p>It cited research showing that excessive screen use can lead to poor sleep, depression and body dissatisfaction.</p>

<p>Sweden's government has previously said it is looking at a ban on smartphones in primary schools.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The former White House Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci has made a stunning claim - that Donald Trump's wife Melania is secretly rooting for Democrat presidential candidate Kamala Harris. He went on to claim that Melania Trump is supporting Kamala Harris because "she hates Donald Trump".</p>

<p>Mr Scaramucci, in his recent interview on the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOCyN9nXXIE" rel="No follow, no index" target="_blank">MediasTouch podcast</a>, claimed Melania Trump is even more enthusiastic about a Kamala Harris victory than he is.</p>

<p>Interestingly, Mr Scaramucci's remarks come at a time when the former First Lady has been absent at husband Donald Trump's political campaign rallies. She was seen only at a few fundraising events and the rally in which there was an assassination attempt on Trump.</p>

<p>Speaking with host Ben Meiselas, Mr Scaramucci claimed Melania Trump is far more keener than him to see Kamala Harris take over the White House. In a response to a question, he said "Maybe Melania Trump. That could be the only person I think of. Because she hates (Trump)," he said.</p>

<p>Mr Scaramucci went on to say that his wife hates Donald Trump too. "My wife hates Trump as much as Melania does," adding jokingly that even the host of the interview is "nicer to Trump than Melania is".</p>

<p><strong>WHO IS ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI?</strong></p>

<p>Anthony Scaramucci was responsible for all communications at the White House for a mere eleven days in 2017 - from July 21 to July 31, following which he was fired by Donald Trump. According to UK news website <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4718658/Sean-Spicer-resigns-White-House-Press-Secretary.html" rel="No follow, no index" target="_blank">Daily Mail</a>, Mr Scaramucci's appointment led to White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer's resignation the very next day. Mr Spicer had voiced his displeasure about Mr Scaramucci being hired.</p>

<p>Within a few days of his appointment Mr Scaramucci found himself in a major PR mess, soon after which then President Donald Trump fired him. John Kelly, the Chief of Staff at the time also questioned his credibility.</p>

<p><strong>DONALD TRUMP TRASHES CLAIMS</strong></p>

<p>Donald Trump has rubbished Mr Scaramucci's comments about him and his wife Melania. Mr Trump dismisses his allegations saying his former aide is a bitter man who holds a grudge.</p>

<p><strong>MELANIA TRUMP'S LOW ATTENDANCE AT TRUMP RALLIES</strong></p>

<p>Melania Trump has been keeping a low profile and has hardly attended husband Donald Trump's rallies. She is reportedly occupied with her son Barron Trump's college education and spends most of her time in New York, where her son is planning to attend college. She has also expressed her fondness for New York.</p>

<p>Melania Trump is reportedly focusing more on family and personal milestones, than on Donald Trump's 2024 Presidential campaign. On October 1 this year, she will release her memoir, Melania. Her office describes the book as "a powerful and inspiring story of a woman who has forged her own path, overcome challenges, and defined personal excellence."<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NASA astronauts on board the International Space Station (ISS) have reported strange, unexplained noises coming from the Boeing Starliner spacecraft. This unexpected incident comes just days before Starliner's scheduled undocking and return to Earth without a crew on September 6.<br />
<br />
Astronaut Butch Wilmore, currently stranded on the ISS alongside Sunita Williams, contacted NASA's Mission Control in Houston to report the unusual sounds. In a recorded conversation, Wilmore noted the noise sounded almost like a sonar ping.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
NASA's Mission Control confirmed the noise as a "pulsing" sound but has yet to determine its origin. The sound has been a source of concern and speculation among both the crew and NASA engineers.<br />
<br />
Experts propose mundane possibilities, such as electromagnetic interference or audio system feedback.</p>

With the Starliner now set for an unmanned return, NASA has decided to bring Wilmore and Williams back to Earth in February 2025 aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President Vladimir Putin said Monday that Kyiv's incursion into Russia's Kursk region will not stop Moscow's advance in east Ukraine and vowed to deal with Ukrainian "bandits" there.</p>

<p>Ukraine's surprise August 6 incursion into Russia has displaced around 130,000 people and seen Kyiv hold on to parts of the border Kursk region.</p>

<p>Moscow has since continued to press into east Ukraine, resisting pulling troops from occupied Ukraine towards Kursk.</p>

<p>"Their calculation was to stop our offensive actions in key parts of the Donbas. The result is known... They did not achieve stopping our advance in the Donbas," Putin told schoolchildren in Siberia.</p>

<p>"The result is clear. Yes, people are going through difficult experiences, especially in the Kursk region. But the main aim that the enemy had -- to stop our offensive in Donbas -- it did not achieve," Putin said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He added Moscow is seeing advances at a "rate that we did not have for a long time."</p>

<p>Kyiv has said one of its aims of going into Kursk was to stretch the Russian army and force it to pull reserves from east Ukraine.</p>

<p>"We have to of course deal with these bandits that entered the territory of the Russian Federation, specifically the Kursk region, attempting to destabilise the situation in the border areas," Putin said.</p>

<p>The Russian leader's language was a break from previous statements on the incursion, which he had described as "the situation that has evolved".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani said that the Islamic State (ISIS) terrorist group no longer poses a threat to Iraq and dialogue to end the US-led international coalition to fight the IS group continues.</p>

<p>Al-Sudani made the remarks during talks with Major General Kevin C. Leahy, commander of the US-led coalition against ISIS in Iraq, in the presence of US ambassador to Iraq Alina L. Romanowski, said al-Sudani's media office in a statement, Xinhua news agency reported.</p>

<p>The remnants of ISIS terrorists have turned into gangs that are being hunted by Iraqi forces in remote areas of the country, the statement said.</p>

<p>The meeting focused on "the progress of the technical dialogue between Iraq and the US-led international coalition about ending the coalition's mission in the country and transferring the mission to bilateral relations between Iraq and the coalition member states," it said.</p>

<p>The discussions also covered ongoing cooperation in training, sharing expertise, and intelligence collaboration with Iraqi security forces, it added.</p>

<p>On January 25, the Iraqi foreign ministry announced that Iraq and the United States had agreed to establish the High-Level Military Committee to oversee the end of the international coalition mission in Iraq and that the focus would shift to developing comprehensive bilateral relations with coalition countries across political, economic, cultural, security, and military dimensions.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi will be on an official visit to Singapore on September 4, 5 to further strengthen bilateral ties between the two nations. The prime minister's visit comes a fortnight after the high-level roundtable between top ministers of both countries.</p>

<p>"Ties between India and Singapore are poised to take-off to an entirely new level of cooperation," the Ministry of External Affairs said at the special briefing about the Prime Minister's visit.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Modi's visit to Singapore comes after six years, said Secretary East, Ministry of External Affairs, Jaideep Mazumdar. India and Singapore are looking to significantly enhance their cooperation in the semiconductor sector, he added.</p>

<p>He also said that the PM's visit to Singapore is "important for trade and investment".</p>

<p>Singapore is India's largest trade partner in ASEAN. It is also a leading source of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in the last financial year with an investment of $11.77 billion in 2023 alone," he said, adding that Singapore is India's sixth largest trade partner worldwide.</p>

<p>During his two-day visit, Prime Minister Modi will also address CEOs, he said.</p>

<p>"Investments have also been very large. Since 2000 till now, we have an accumulative FDI of USD 160 billion dollars. There will be an interaction with business leaders in the PM's visit. This will be an important element of the visit as Prime Minister will address the CEOs in his visit, where they will hear India's growth story first hand," Mr Mazumdar said.</p>

<p>"His [PM Modi's] first visit to Singapore was in his first term as the Prime Minister. This visit is of great significance as it's his visit early in his term, and also as the new Prime Minister Lawrence Wong has taken oath recently and Singaporeans are excited to welcome PM Modi. This is an opportune time to set the stage for India-Singapore's vibrant bilateral relations for the next stage of India-Singapore bilateral relations. Our ties have evolved and we have a dynamic strategic partnership encompassing diverse areas from our shared history and people-to-people ties, which form an important link between us," he added.</p>

<p>Speaking about the special roundtable framework shared by the two nations, he said "We have identified new anchors of our partnership under the India-Singapore ministerial roundtable framework. The visit will also take place in the light of our 60th anniversary of diplomatic relations which we're celebrating in 2025 and 10th year of our strategic partnership with Singapore."</p>

<p>"During the recently concluded India-Singapore Ministerial Roundtable, which is a unique forum between ministers on both sides on diverse areas, a number of new forward-looking futuristic areas were identified in digitization, skill, sustainability, health, advanced manufacturing and connectivity. We are likely to exchange a number of MoUs in these areas in the forthcoming visit of the PM," he said.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President Joe Biden will sit down on Monday with US negotiators pushing for a hostage-release deal in the Israel-Hamas war, the White House said, after the deaths of six captives in Gaza, including an American citizen.</p>

<p>Biden's official schedule was revised to make time for the White House meeting, which will also be attended by Vice President Kamala Harris, who is running to succeed him in November's presidential election.</p>

<p>A statement announcing Biden's updated schedule said he and Harris would meet Monday "with the US hostage deal negotiating team following the murder of American citizen Hersh Goldberg-Polin and five other hostages by Hamas on Saturday, and discuss efforts to drive towards a deal that secures the release of the remaining hostages."</p>

<p>The United States, along with fellow mediators Egypt and Qatar, has spent months pushing for a hostage-prisoner exchange and ceasefire in the war in Gaza.</p>

<p>Militants seized 251 hostages during the October 7 attack on Israel that sparked the war, 97 of whom remain in Gaza, including 33 the Israeli military says are dead.</p>

<p>Scores of hostages were released during a one-week truce in November, with campaigners and family members believing another deal is the best option to ensure the rest return.</p>

<p>A nationwide strike in Israel aimed at ramping up pressure on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government to secure the release of the remaining captives was set to begin Monday.</p>

<p>Hostage relatives and advocates have accused Netanyahu's administration of not doing enough to bring the captives back alive, and have called for an immediate ceasefire to rescue the rest.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Elon Musk, who rechristened Twitter X, seemed to have momentarily forgotten the new name of his social media platform. The billionaire entrepreneur, on Monday, referred to X as "Twitter" in a post after the platform was banned in Brazil.<br />
<br />
Mr Musk shared a meme that showed a person lying on a pile of money, with the caption "POV: VPN companies after Brazil banned Twitter." The use of the original name did not go unnoticed, with many users joking that the "rebranding is going well."</p>

Mr Musk has responded by calling the judge an "evil dictator cosplaying as a judge" and accusing him of trying to destroy democracy in Brazil.<br />
<br />
The ban comes after a months-long standoff between Mr Musk and the Brazilian authorities investigating the spread of disinformation on the platform. The judge previously ordered the suspension of several accounts belonging to supporters of former President Jair Bolsonaro, who tried to discredit the voting system in the 2022 election.<br />
<br />
Mr Musk's platform has over 22 million users in Brazil and has been accused of allowing the spread of disinformation and hate speech. The judge's order also includes a fine of 50,000 reais (Rs 7.5 lakhs) for anyone who tries to bypass the ban using VPNs or other technological means.<br />
<br />
Mr Musk has expressed outrage, calling the ban an attack on free speech and democracy.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former childcare worker Ashley Paul Griffith on Monday pleaded guilty to raping, sexually abusing and exploiting dozens of girls under his care in Australia and Italy.</p>

<p>It took Judge Anthony Rafter more than two hours to read out the 307 charges against Griffith in the Brisbane courtroom where several victims and their families had gathered, according to state broadcast ABC.</p>

<p>Police accused the 46-year-old of being one of Australia's worst-ever paedophiles after the charges against him were made public last year.</p>

<p>Griffith was first arrested in 2022 for making child sexual abuse content. A year later he was charged with 1,623 offences against 91 children.</p>

<p>However, some charges were dropped and the ABC reported that Monday's charges related to roughly 60 children. Many of the victims were under the age of 12.</p>

<p>The offences happened between 2003 and 2022 in twelve different locations across Australia as well as Pisa, Italy.</p>

<p>Griffith is in custody and will be sentenced at a later date. The court heard sentencing could take more than two days to give time to read victim impact statements, the ABC reported.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Nearly five million Lego pieces were lost at sea when a cargo ship nearly capsized off the coast of England in 1997.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On a gloomy drizzly day in late June, Hayley Hardstaff, a marine biologist from Cornwall, England, took her routine walk along Portwrinkle Beach. What began as an ordinary stroll turned extraordinary when she stumbled upon a black, plastic dragon with a missing upper jaw. To her surprise, it was a piece of Lego, not just any piece, but a remnant of one of history's most curious maritime mishaps.</p>

<p>In 1997, an accident involving a cargo ship and a rogue wave led to one of the most bizarre environmental disasters in history - the Great Lego Spill. Nearly five million Lego pieces, including 33,427 black dragons, were lost at sea when the Tokio Express, a cargo ship en route from Rotterdam to New York, nearly capsized off the coast of England. The incident resulted in the loss of all 62 of its shipping containers, causing one of the largest toy-related environmental disasters.</p>

<p>Twenty-seven years later, people are still finding these tiny plastic artefacts on beaches across Europe.</p>

<p>Tracey Williams, who started the "Lego Lost at Sea" Facebook page, has been documenting these Lego finds for years. The spill included nautically themed pieces like dragons, octopuses, seaweed, scuba tanks and life rafts. Some pieces, like black dragons and green octopuses, have become prized finds for beachcombers.<br />
<br />
<iframe allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" height="497" scrolling="no" src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FLegoLostAtSea%2Fposts%2Fpfbid08byNCC4YRvYYjcK6LZJAkBuaqECp6Se5ofEKVfNnCqa1Pdhz7u1gvmH8wpA8eBxtl&amp;show_text=false&amp;width=500" style="border:none;overflow:hidden" width="500"></iframe><br />
<br />
Oceanographer Curtis Ebbesmeyer, known for tracking the 1992 Friendly Floatees Spill, pointed out that ocean currents can carry debris to far-off places, making the extent of such pollution hard to track. While some pieces have been found in the Netherlands, France and Belgium, many remain lost, possibly sunk to the ocean floor.<br />
<br />
Mr Ebbesmeyer's curiosity about the Cornwall spill led him to investigate further. He contacted Lego and received an inventory of the container's contents, along with samples of the pieces. Testing them in his bathtub revealed that half of the pieces floated, which could explain why many remain missing.<br />
<br />
In the years since, pieces have sporadically appeared, often found by fishermen trawling the ocean floor. One of the rarest finds, a Lego shark, was recently caught 20 miles off the Cornish coast, marking the first sighting of this specific piece in 27 years. This leaves 51,799 more of these sharks still unaccounted for, according to the "Lego Lost at Sea" account.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">CATCH OF THE DAY!<br />
Oh my goodness – our very first Lego shark from the Great Lego Spill of 1997 has just been hauled up from the deep! Caught in a fisherman's net and somewhat battered and bruised after 27 years at the bottom of the ocean, this Lego shark is one of 51,800 lost… <a href="https://t.co/EFbuGU6NGU">pic.twitter.com/EFbuGU6NGU</a></p>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Professor Andrew Turner considers the incident an interesting case study due to public awareness. Unlike most container spills, the Great Lego Spill was made public, and it represents just a small part of the vast plastic pollution in the ocean.<br />
<br />
Mr Turner says it is just the "tip of the iceberg" when it comes to plastic pollution in the ocean. He pointed out the vast amounts of plastic that remain on the ocean floor, much of which is unaccounted for and whose potential impact is still largely unknown.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hollywood star George Clooney has heaped praise on US President Joe Biden over the latter's decision to step down from the 2024 presidential race.</p>

<p>The actor attended the press event in Venice for his film 'Wolfs', and shared his opinion on Biden passing the baton to the current Vice President of the United States, Kamala Harris, reports Variety.</p>

<p>He said: "I've actually never had to answer that question so I suppose I will do it here. The person who should be applauded is the President, who has done the most selfless thing a President has done since George Washington."</p>

<p>"What should be remembered is the selfless act of someone who, it's very hard to let go of power - we know that we've seen it all over the world - and for someone to say I think there's a better path forward, all the credit goes to him. And that's really the truth ... I'm just very proud of where we are in the state of the world right now," he added.</p>

<p>During the event, he was also asked about Apple moving the film from a wide theatrical release to a limited one. He also brought up a New York Times report from last week by Nicole Sterling that he and Pitt were paid more than $35 million each.</p>

<p>"It was millions and millions of dollars less than what was reported," he said. "I think it's bad for our industry to have that be the standard."</p>

<p>As per Variety, on the changing state of the industry and moviegoing, he said that streaming is an absolute necessity.</p>

<p>"We need it. Our industry needs this. And (streamers) also benefit from having films released," he said. "But we haven't got it all figured out yet. This is a revolution in our industry. We need Apple and Amazon and they actually need distributors. They need to have Sony or Warner Bros, who have been doing this for 100 years."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The number of people in England with food allergies has more than doubled between 2008 and 2018, a new study reveals.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="theconversation-article-title">The number of people in England with food allergies has more than doubled between 2008 and 2018, a <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(24)00163-4/fulltext">new study</a> reveals. The researchers, from Imperial College London, found that rates are highest among preschool children, with 4% having a “probable” food allergy.</p>

<div class="theconversation-article-body">
<p>They also found that a third of those people at risk of anaphylaxis – a life-threatening allergic reaction – don't carry adrenaline autoinjector “pens”, such as EpiPens. People in deprived areas were found to be less likely to have been prescribed these life-saving injectors.</p>

<p>The true number of people with food allergies has been difficult to establish, with estimates varying between <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32067114/">under 1% and over 9% of children</a>. This is because several methods are used to estimate the frequency of food allergies, including using either the number of prescriptions of adrenaline pens, self-reporting, or blood tests to identify telltale antibodies.</p>

<p>Self-reporting is the least reliable method because many people confuse food intolerance with allergy, as is evident from a <a href="https://www.food.gov.uk/research/food-hypersensitivity/patterns-and-prevalence-of-adult-food-allergy">recent report</a> by the UK's Food Standards Agency.</p>

<p>Of the over 30% of adults who reported an adverse reaction to foods, only 6% were subsequently confirmed to have a true food allergy. To bridge this gap in understanding how common food allergies are, the new study from Imperial College took a much broader approach to better estimate the incidence of food allergy.</p>

<p>Population healthcare data from over 7.5 million people in England and a combination of clinical criteria were used to identify people with food allergies in these health records.</p>

<p>People were considered to have an allergy if doctors indicated they had either had a possible or probable allergy or if they had been prescribed an adrenaline pen or both. Using this combination, the number of people with food allergies was shown to have doubled in a decade. Curiously, since 2018, levels have plateaued somewhat at around 4% in preschool children, 2.4% in school-aged children, and under 1% in adults.</p>

<p>The study, published in The Lancet Public Health, used a broad range of criteria to identify people with food allergies. Not all cases were confirmed by medical professionals using additional tests, such as the presence of antibodies in blood or food-challenge tests where people are given increasing amounts of certain foods to see if an allergic reaction occurs.</p>

<p>Some types of food allergy may have been missed, such as <a href="https://www.allergyuk.org/resources/oral-allergy-syndrome-pollen-food-syndrome-factsheet/">pollen food allergy syndrome</a>. This occurs when people with specific pollen allergies eat some raw foods, including certain stoned fruits, that cause mild irritant symptoms, such as itching of the mouth. Still, there are important questions as to why food allergies have been rising, and why they may now be plateauing.</p>

<h3><strong>Puzzling</strong></h3>

<p>The trend in the increased rate of allergies in developed countries has puzzled scientists for years. The <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15007629/">“old friend's hypothesis”</a> is one theory that may account for the growing incidence of chronic conditions such as allergies.</p>

<p>This hypothesis considers the role of the microbiome (the collection of helpful bacteria, fungi and viruses that live in and on us), infections and the environment in shaping our immune response and causing it to misfire.</p>

<p>Evidence to support this theory is accumulating. For example, studies show that <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29105784/#:%7E:text=Early%2Dlife%20exposure%20to%20antibiotics,%3B%20I2%20%3A%2077.0%25.">high use of antibiotics</a> in early childhood as the immune system and microbiome are developing is linked to a greater likelihood of allergy in later life.</p>

<p>Pollution exposure can also enhance the risk of allergy and <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36810617/">worsen the severity of symptoms</a>.</p>

<p>The food we were exposed to in early life may be important in determining if we develop an allergy. <a href="https://www.food.gov.uk/research/food-allergy-and-intolerance-research/testing-of-government-advice-on-peanut-consumption-during-early-life">Previous advice</a> from the UK government about avoiding early exposure to peanuts and eggs may inadvertently be linked to the rise in food allergy to peanuts and eggs.</p>

<p>Conversely, <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1414850">studies show</a> that early exposure before the age of five to <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26943128/">peanuts and eggs</a> is <a href="https://evidence.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/EVIDoa2300311">linked to</a> a reduced likelihood of developing an allergy.</p>

<p>The advice in the UK to avoid peanuts and eggs during pregnancy and early childhood was changed in <a href="https://www.food.gov.uk/research/food-allergy-and-intolerance-research/testing-of-government-advice-on-peanut-consumption-during-early-life">2009</a>, but the trials showing the positive effects of early exposure to eggs and peanuts were only published in 2015 and 2016. However, it is possible that the plateauing incidence of food allergy cases is linked to changes in advice and the published infant food exposure trials.</p>

<p>Diagnosis is only part of the story. People also need to be able to effectively manage their condition. This requires patients to have access to the right advice and support from experts, such as dietitians, as well as the drugs needed to halt an anaphylactic attack.</p>

<p>For babies diagnosed with a food allergy, there is no <a href="https://journals.lww.com/co-clinicalnutrition/fulltext/2014/05000/Food_allergy_in_children__what_is_new_.15.aspx">good evidence</a>&nbsp;that incrementally reintroducing the food that causes the allergy can retrain the immune system and might help the child overcome their allergy. However, this must only be done under the guidance of a medical team.</p>

<p>The new study showed that allergy care was largely managed at GP practices in England. However, GP clinics may lack the specialist resources needed for proper allergy support, such as safely re-introducing foods.</p>

<p>It is clear that people in the UK with allergies need better support.<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A California grandmother died after a suicidal man jumped from a highway overpass onto the windshield of her car. The incident occurred on August 9 when Margarita Novela Galindo and her husband, Florencio, were on the 210 Freeway near Sylmar, heading for a weekend getaway, reported ABC.</p>

<p>The Los Angeles Fire Department received a call about a man threatening to jump from the Roxford Street overpass around 7 pm, according to a KABC report. Shortly after, the man followed through with his threat, plunging into the path of the Galindos' vehicle.</p>

<p>The impact was severe. The man crashed through the windshield, landing directly on Ms Margarita, who was seated in the passenger seat. Her husband, who was driving the car, escaped without serious injuries.</p>

<p>The grandmother-of-seven died on August 28 after spending nearly three weeks in critical condition.</p>

<p>Ms Margarita's death has left her family devastated. "It's incredibly unfair that her life was taken because someone else didn't want theirs," her son David Galindo wrote on a <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/8e5ke-support-for-a-loving-mothers-farewell?utm_campaign=fp_sharesheet_ai&amp;utm_content=amp9v2&amp;utm_medium=customer&amp;utm_source=copy_link ">GoFundMe</a> page set up to help with medical expenses and funeral costs.</p>

<p>The family is now grappling with the "what ifs" of the tragic accident, wondering if a slight delay or detour could have changed the outcome. "What if she stopped to get gas? What if she stopped to get water? This probably wouldn't have happened," David told <a href="https://abc7.com/post/woman-dies-after-man-jumps-off-210-freeway-sylmar-lands-vehicle/15250346/">ABC7</a>.</p>

<p>He said that his father is “now alone without the love of his life.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Florencio Galindo harbours no ill will for the man whose actions led to his wife's death. "He doesn't know what problems he may have had to commit suicide," his daughter Stephanie translated her father's words from Spanish.&nbsp;</p><p><div class='table-div suicide'><table class='table'><thead><tr><th colspan='2'>Helplines</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Vandrevala Foundation for Mental Health</td><td><a href='tel:+919999666555'>9999666555</a> or <a href='mailto:help@vandrevalafoundation.com'>help@vandrevalafoundation.com</a> </td></tr><tr><td>TISS iCall</td><td><a href='tel:+912225521111'>022-25521111</a> (Monday-Saturday: 8 am to 10 pm)</td></tr> <tr><td colspan='2'>(If you need support or know someone who does, please reach out to your nearest mental health specialist.)</td></tr></tbody></table></div></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you've been wondering why you see only a certain kind of content on your X feed, its owner Elon Musk has the answer. The billionaire, in a post on Monday, shed light on the platform's inner workings.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The X algorithm operates on a simple yet effective principle: "If you interact with content, you want to see more of that content." This means your engagement such as likes, comments, and shares with posts directly influences the algorithm's decisions on what content to display.<br />
<br />
Mr Musk elaborated on one of the algorithm's key signals – sharing content. "One of the strongest signals is if you forward X posts to friends, it assumes you like that content a lot because it takes effort to forward," he wrote. This means that when users share a post, the algorithm interprets that action as a strong endorsement of the content, pushing similar items into their feed frequently.<br />
<br />
However, Mr Musk also acknowledged a significant flaw in this logic. He pointed out that the algorithm does not understand the intent behind a user's interaction, particularly when the motivation is negative. "Unfortunately, if the actual reason you forwarded the content to friends was because you were outraged by it, we are currently not smart enough to realise that," he admitted.</p>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>In a follow-up post, Mr Musk shared his support for “freedom of speech”. “I like content that supports freedom of speech,” he declared, adding, “Long live X. Long live freedom of speech.”</p>

I'll cage fight the dictator in Brazil if I have to</p>
— Elon Musk (Parody) (@ElonMuskAOC) <a href="https://twitter.com/ElonMuskAOC/status/1830441337419870341?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 2, 2024</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Going a step further, he wrote, “I'll cage fight the dictator in Brazil if I have to.” This remark was aimed at Brazil's Chief Justice Alexandre de Moraes, whom Mr Musk has previously labelled a “tyrant” and a “dictator.”&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The feud between the two began in April when Elon Musk announced he would unsuspend accounts linked to the 2023 Brazilian Congress attack in Brasilia, despite a court order to keep them blocked.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
In response, Alexandre de Moraes opened an investigation into the X owner, accusing him of spreading fake news, obstructing justice and inciting criminal activities. He also ordered Brazilian internet service providers to block access to X, threatened daily fines for users trying to bypass the ban by using VPNs, and even froze the finances of Mr Musk's company, Starlink, in Brazil.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Elon Musk fired back by accusing Mr Moraes of undermining democracy and has used X to criticise the judge's actions.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Malaysia Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim and his New Zealand counterpart Chris Luxon on Monday said they were united in calling for an immediate ceasefire in the conflict in Gaza and finding a two-state solution between Israel and Palestine. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We both are very united in calling for an immediate ceasefire, getting the parties around the negotiating table and finding a two-state solution," Luxon said at a joint press conference. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Anwar said prospects for a ceasefire did not look encouraging at present, saying there was a lack of commitment from countries, particularly the United States, who could exert their influence to stop the conflict.</p>

<p>"The only hope is to engage the United States to take a stronger stance," Anwar said.</p>

<p>Muslim-majority Malaysia is a staunch supporter of the Palestinian cause and has long advocated a two-state solution to the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.</p>

<p>Anwar has good relations with the political leadership of the Palestinian group Hamas but maintains he has no involvement in its military apparatus.</p>

<p>Luxon, who is on a three-day visit to Malaysia, also said New Zealand would expand defence cooperation with Malaysia and was deploying one of its air force's P8 Poseidon patrol and reconnaissance aircraft to Butterworth in Malaysia's northern Penang state, for a joint exercise.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>South Korean police have launched an investigation into the messaging platform Telegram over deepfake online sex crimes, Yonhap news agency reported on Monday, citing a senior police official.</p>

<p>The probe will examine whether it had been abetting the distribution of sexually explicit deepfake content, Yonhap said, quoting the head of the National Office of Investigation.</p>

<p>An official at the National Police Agency's cyber investigation bureau declined to confirm the report when reached by telephone.</p>

<p>South Korean authorities have called on Telegram and other social media platforms for cooperation in fighting sexually explicit deepfake content.</p>

<p>The steps follow reports by several domestic media outlets that sexually explicit deepfake images and videos of South Korean women were often found in Telegram chatrooms.</p>

<p>Telegram could not immediately be reached for comment but the company last week said it actively moderates harmful content on its platform including illegal pornography.</p>

<p>"Moderators use a combination of proactive monitoring of public parts of the platform, sophisticated AI tools and user reports in order to remove millions of pieces of harmful content each day," it said in a statement.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The West is openly persecuting Russian journalists, President Vladimir Putin said in remarks published on Monday, days after Moscow banned dozens of US journalists from entering the country.</p>

<p>"In order to hide from inconvenient facts, from truthful information, the West, which considers itself the standard of freedom, has launched an open persecution against Russian correspondents," Putin told the Mongolian newspaper Onoodor on the eve of his visit to the country, according to a transcript provided on the Kremlin's website.</p>

<p>His remarks come after Moscow said on Wednesday it was banning entry to Russia for 92 US citizens, including journalists, lawyers, and the heads of what it said were key military-industrial firms, over what it described as Washington's Russophobic stance.</p>

<p>They also follow years of the Kremlin's suppression of independent media and Moscow's swift blocking of dissenting voices in Russian-language media outlets at the start of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022.</p>

<p>Putin said that in Russia, media are free.</p>

<p>"The only requirement for them is compliance with Russian legislation," he said. "Foreign correspondents accredited in our country should understand this."</p>

<p>Russia has frequently accused Western countries of imposing unfair restrictions on its media abroad, including bans on some state-backed news outlets.</p>

<p>Putin told the Mongolian newspaper that Russian journalists face "direct censorship" in almost all Western countries.</p>

<p>"The only thing our media do is to convincingly convey the Russian point of view on current modern problems and processes taking place in the world," Putin said.</p>

<p>In May, Russian lawmakers passed a bill giving prosecutors powers to shut foreign media bureaus in Moscow if a Western country has been "unfriendly" to Russian media.</p>

<p>Washington has imposed sanctions against some state-run Russian TV stations, which it says have spread disinformation to bolster Russia's war in Ukraine.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[As Kamala Harris heads into the November presidential race against Donald Trump, a social club she joined in college four decades ago might just pay its biggest dividends yet.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As Kamala Harris heads into the November presidential race against Donald Trump, a social club she joined in college four decades ago might just pay its biggest dividends yet.</p>

<p>"Whatever it is that she needs our coalitions to do, we're going to be there to help push it out and get it done," said Tanya Baham, a member of Harris's college sorority, in attendance at the recent Democratic National Convention.</p>

<p>Sororities and fraternities abound across US college campuses -- with their Greek-letter names, exclusive memberships, and promise of community, usually along same-sex lines.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But Harris's membership in Alpha Kappa Alpha, a historically Black sorority, provides her campaign a direct line to a network of 360,000 women across the country, many of whom are excited to see one of their own in the White House.</p>

<p>And the Democratic Party, which counts women and Black voters as key constituencies in their electoral base, is paying attention.</p>

<p>While the sorority itself is non-partisan, many, like Baham, are ready to individually tap their networks for fundraising and voter registration in an election that could come down to the wire.</p>

<p>"We're... going to make certain that our kiddos, the young folks, the old folks, get a chance to register and then get to the polls," said Baham, a social worker in Louisiana.</p>

<h3><strong>Built-in network</strong></h3>

<p>Harris joined AKA at Howard University, a historically Black school in Washington where the sorority was founded in 1908 -- the first such organization for Black undergraduate women in the United States.</p>

<p>Over the next few decades, more Black sororities and fraternities emerged, providing African American students refuge amid the scourge of American racism and also serving as bases for civil rights organizing.</p>

<p>AKA has chapters for both undergraduate students and college graduates, making it far more than just a college-level organization.</p>

<p>As vice president, Harris has hosted Black sorority and fraternity leaders at the White House, and ahead of rising to the top of the Democratic ticket she headlined AKA's convention in Texas, in July.</p>

<p>Later that month, within days of President Joe Biden ending his reelection bid, she was at a convention for another Black sorority, Zeta Phi Beta, in Indiana.</p>

<p>AKA members were among those on a "Win With Black Women" Zoom call which raised $1.5 million, and Glenda Glover, the sorority's former president, is leading outreach for Harris at the country's historically Black colleges.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a historic first, AKA has also formed a political action committee, used for fundraising for political candidates.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We're just all ready to work and do this," Donna Miller, a county official in Illinois who was on the Zoom call, told the Chicago Sun-Times. "It invigorated so many people from young and old, across generations, across ethnicity."</p>

<h3><strong>Tight-lipped&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>But while AKA and other Black sororities provide a network for Harris to tap into, it is hard to gauge how much that will translate into actual votes come November.</p>

<p>The sorority and its members have generally been tight-lipped -- multiple members declined to speak with AFP about the election.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Some referred AFP to the sorority's headquarters, which did not respond to multiple requests for comment. A half dozen individual chapters also did not respond to requests for comment.</p>

<p>"Mobilization through sororities can't hurt," said Daniel Hopkins, a political scientist at the University of Pennsylvania.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But Hopkins cautioned that "there are only so many voters in the US in general who attend four-year colleges, who are members of these organizations."</p>

<p>And while African Americans are overwhelmingly Democratic voters, they have been peeling off from the party in recent years -- a decline that has mostly come from younger and infrequent voters, according to his research.</p>

<p>At the same time, Amanda Wilkerson, an assistant professor of higher education at the University of Central Florida who has studied Black voters, said organizations like Black sororities and fraternities are "hidden apparatuses," often ignored by polling or the media even as they've organized for previous elections, both nationally and locally.</p>

<p>Their members and alumni are well-versed in campaigning, she said, and the 2024 election isn't their first go-around.</p>

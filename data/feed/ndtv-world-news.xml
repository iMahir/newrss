       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Colombia's Constitutional Court on Wednesday annulled a controversial carbon credit deal in the Amazon rainforest, which six local tribes said had been signed without their consent.</p>

<p>Indigenous communities living in the remote area of Pira Parana had accused US-based Ruby Canyon Environmental and Colombian company Masbosques, which acted as an intermediary, of illegally foisting the deal on them.</p>

<p>Carbon credits are bought by corporations -- or countries under certain conditions -- from forest preservation or other projects to offset or "compensate" their greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

<p>This money is supposed to go to local communities that protect their home regions from deforestation.</p>

<p>In Pira Parana, the credits -- also known as green bonds -- were sold for about $3.8 million to a Colombian data processing firm called Latin Checkout.</p>

<p>According to EcoRegistry, which keeps tabs on carbon credit trading, Latin Checkout then sold the credits to US airline Delta which faces a lawsuit at home for alleged "greenwashing" by claiming to be carbon-neutral while purchasing questionable carbon offsets.</p>

<p>The deal, signed in March 2021, was for the Indigenous communities to preserve an area of 7,100 square kilometers (2,741 miles) -- close to the size of Puerto Rico.</p>

<p>But the tribes said the deal was signed with false representatives of their communities.</p>

<p>They went to court claiming violations of their rights to territorial autonomy and self-government.</p>

<p>On Monday, the court ordered the tribes' legitimate representatives to meet and decide within six months whether to authorize a new agreement.</p>

<p>If they do not, authorities must "ensure" the carbon credit project "is no longer carried out in the territory," the judges ruled.</p>

<p>The concept behind carbon credits has taken a major hit recently as scientific research has repeatedly shown claims of reduced emissions being hugely overestimated -- or even nonexistent.</p>

<p>In late 2023, AFP walked, motor-boated and overflew part of the Pira Parana territory, an area so remote it is accessible only by million-dollar private flights or a boat trip of at least six days from the nearest city of Mitu.</p>

<p>There, local leaders said they wished they had never heard of the deal.</p>

<p>While it brought an economic "bonanza," it also led to conflict in communities unaccustomed to handling large sums of money and a loss of Indigenous autonomy, they said.</p>

<p>The project "contaminates spiritually, physically, it destroys everything... in this territory, for money," Indigenous leader Fabio Valencia said at the time.</p>

<p>Some experts have said there was no real deforestation threat in the area and therefore no emissions "savings" to be made.</p>

<p>The Constitutional Court case was the first of its kind in Colombia.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From Yoda figurines to Lego stormtrooper helmets, Star Wars is everywhere around the Massive Entertainment video game studio that's about to unveil a hotly anticipated title drawn from George Lucas's iconic franchise.</p>

<p>Hundreds of developers spent years making "Star Wars Outlaws", a process the Malmo, Sweden-based studio's executives say took them from mere fans to craftspeople on the beloved epic.</p>

<p>"We had to take a step back," said game developer Mathias Karlson, and "make the journey from fandom to being a craftsperson together with Lucasfilms creating something new, a new perspective."</p>

<p>Anticipation is building ahead of the August 30 release of "Star Wars Outlaws", an open-world game set between the events of the "Empire Strikes Back" and "Return of the Jedi".</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Get a first glimpse at the new thrilling gameplay and open world of Star Wars Outlaws. Join us on June 10th at 12PM PDT/ 9 PM CEST at <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/UbiForward?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#UbiForward</a> to learn more! <a href="https://t.co/VkRkeAFuXG">pic.twitter.com/VkRkeAFuXG</a></p>

<p>"Many of us grew up with Star Wars," said the studio's operations director Alf Condelius. "I was 11 years old when I saw the first film and when I got home, I asked myself how I'd lived 11 years without Star Wars."</p>

<p>"It's been a fantastic journey almost like reconnecting with childhood", said Karlson.</p>

<p>The Swedish studios, owned by French giant Ubisoft, partnered up with the Star Wars creator's LucasFilm company and began chipping away at the project in 2020.</p>

<p>"We wanted to create a video game in which the player would be the director of their own experience, giving them all the possible options -- which vehicle to choose, where to go, which criminal group to pledge allegiance to, everything that makes a bandit or outlaw adventure really come alive", the studio's creative director Julian Gerighty told AFP. &nbsp;</p>

<p>While a plethora of games based on the Star Wars franchise already exists, and designers can only work in a specific fictional era, the creators of "Outlaw" promised players extra power and agency.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We were given a lot of create freedom to come up with new things," Gerighty said.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Playing a thief</strong></h3>

<p>Players will step into the shoes of Kay Vess, who is about to pull off the heist of the century.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Wearing a leather jacket, heavily tattooed, a pistol on her belt, and always accompanied by her trusted galactic animal companion Nix, Kay Vess explores planets and navigates between crime bosses in order to gain her freedom.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The young woman comes from Cantonica, a fictional desert planet known for its casino city, which saga lovers discovered in 2017 in the eighth film, "The Last Jedi".</p>

<p>"It's easier to make something new than trying to recreate (the planet) Tatooine as accurately as possible," Gerighty said.</p>

<p>The sound and aesthetics echo the trilogies of George Lucas, whose own sources of inspiration influenced the designers.</p>

<p>"We make references to Wild West and samurai films," said Cloe Hammoud, who created the game worlds, adding that creators from 57 countries used "cinematic realism to get closer to the atmosphere (of the films), using for example the same objectives, the same style."</p>

<p>The game, which lasts about 60 hours, is appropriate for all ages and will be available on PC, PS5 and Xbox X/S.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>UK police said Wednesday a 26-year-old man was in custody after the wife and two daughters of a radio racing commentator were killed with a crossbow in a suspected "targeted" attack.</p>

<p>Kyle Clifford, 26, from Enfield in north London, was wanted in connection with the deaths of the three women in the town of Bushey, north of London, on Tuesday night.</p>

<p>The victims were Carol Hunt, the 61-year-old wife of BBC radio and Sky Sports racing commentator John Hunt, and their two daughters, Louise, 25, and Hannah, 28, the broadcasters said.</p>

<p>In a statement Wednesday, police said Clifford, who was found by officers in Enfield, "was known to the victims" and no additional suspects were being sought.</p>

<p>Clifford was "receiving medical treatment having been found with injuries," police said.</p>

<p>Local police previously said officers were called to a house in the leafy commuter town where the three women were pronounced dead at the scene.</p>

<p>Chief Superintendent Jon Simpson called it "a horrific incident involving what is currently believed to be a crossbow, but other weapons may also have been used".</p>

<p>A primary school in nearby Enfield kept children indoors during the police search.</p>

<p>There is no licence required to own a crossbow in the UK, but it is illegal to carry one in public without a reasonable excuse.</p>

<p>Interior minister Yvette Cooper called the deaths "truly shocking" and said she was being kept updated about the inquiry.</p>

<p>A spokeswoman for her department said legislation was "under constant review and a call for evidence was launched earlier this year to look at whether further controls on crossbows should be introduced".</p>

<p>She said the minister would "swiftly consider the findings to see if laws need to be tightened further".</p>

<p><strong>- 'Shocking' -</strong></p>

<p>BBC Radio Five Live sent a note to staff calling the incident "utterly devastating".</p>

<p>Sky Sports Racing said on X that the team was "deeply saddened by the tragic deaths" and "our thoughts are with our colleague John Hunt, his family and friends at this awful time".</p>

<p>One neighbour described hearing "shrill" screams from the home on Tuesday.</p>

<p>The 46-year-old who lives near the scene, said "absolute chaos" then broke out as armed police put the road into lockdown.</p>

<p>"We had armed police running down, screaming 'stay in your house'," she added.</p>

<p>Another neighbour told reporters the victims were a friendly family.</p>

<p>"We would see them every day passing by and they would say good morning," she said. "It's really sad what's happened, very shocking."</p>

<p>In March, a 47-year-old man was arrested after two people were injured in separate crossbow attacks in London's Shoreditch area.</p>

<p>Last October Jaswant Singh Chail, 21, was jailed after being found in the grounds of Windsor Castle, west of London, with a loaded crossbow.</p>

<p>He broke into the royal residence on Christmas Day 2021 and told police he was trying to kill Queen Elizabeth II.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NATO countries at their summit in Washington on Wednesday came up with what alliance chief Jens Stoltenberg called a "substantial package" of support for Ukraine.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But what exactly is NATO offering the war-torn country two and half years into Russia's invasion?</p>

<p><strong>'Trump-proofing' arms supplies </strong></p>

<p>NATO will take a greater role from the United States in coordinating training and weapons deliveries for Ukraine by setting up a centralized command.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The move is aimed at shielding supplies to Kyiv from a potential return to the White House by Donald Trump after November's presidential election.</p>

<p>The change will see hundreds of personnel from different NATO members stationed at a base in Germany, and key hubs along the alliance's eastern flank.</p>

<p>The switch is quite modest -- and a three-star US General looks likely to take the lead.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But its an important step for an alliance that has so far steered clear of having a direct role in arming Ukraine for fears it would drag NATO closer to war with Russia.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>40-billion-euro pledge </strong></p>

<p>NATO countries have pledged to maintain support for Ukraine for a further year at the rate they have been doing since Russia invaded -- a minimum of 40 billion euros ($43 billion).</p>

<p>"Through proportional contributions, allies intend to provide a minimum baseline funding of 40 billion euros within the next year, and to provide sustainable levels of security assistance for Ukraine to prevail," a summit declaration said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The political promise is designed to put aid on a firmer footing -- but it is not legally binding and could be ignored by future leaders.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Initially, Stoltenberg had hoped to get allies to make it a multi-year commitment but the US demanded a review next year.</p>

<p><strong>'Irreversible path' to membership </strong></p>

<p>NATO didn't give Ukraine what it really wants: a clear invite to join the alliance in the near future.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Instead leaders reaffirmed the commitment that Kyiv will one day become a member "when allies agree and conditions are met."</p>

<p>To offer Ukraine some encouragement, leaders did agree to say that Kyiv's path to membership is "irreversible."</p>

<p>They also declared that the NATO package "constitutes a bridge" to joining.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Air defenses </strong></p>

<p>More concretely, US President Joe Biden announced a major package of advanced air defenses to help Kyiv repel Russia's attacks.</p>

<p>Much of it was already known -- including Germany and Romania sending a Patriot battery each, Netherlands providing parts for one and Italy giving a similar system.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On top of that the United States will now add one more Patriot system of its own.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The commitments still see NATO falling short of giving Ukraine the seven Patriot systems that it has been desperately pleading for since April.</p>

<p>Biden and other leaders said they would provide Ukraine dozens of shorter-range systems in the coming months.</p>

<p><strong>Fighter jets</strong></p>

<p>The US, Netherlands and Denmark announced that the long-promised transfer of F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine was "now underway" and they would be operational in the skies this summer.</p>

<p>Denmark and the Netherlands had already said they were aiming to get the aircraft to Kyiv in the near future.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In total, NATO allies have promised to deliver dozens of F-16 jets to Kyiv in the coming years.</p>

<p>That is still well short of the roughly 120 that Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky says his country needs.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NATO allies on Wednesday announced they had started transferring F-16 jets to Ukraine and stepped up promises to Kyiv on eventual membership in the alliance at a 75th anniversary summit clouded by political uncertainties in the United States.</p>

<p>With the pomp of the three-day gathering in the US capital, President Joe Biden is aiming to rally the West and also reassure US voters amid pre-election scrutiny on whether at 81 -- six years older than the alliance -- he remains fit for the job.</p>

<p>Biden individually welcomed the other 31 leaders of the alliance before urging them to keep pace with Russia's military production, which has stepped up sharply in the two years since President Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine.</p>

<p>"We can -- and will -- defend every inch of NATO territory and we'll do it together," Biden told the North Atlantic Council, the formal decision-making body of the alliance, at Washington's convention center as the city sweltered in a heat wave.</p>

<p>Biden announced that Denmark and the Netherlands had begun sending US-made F-16 jets to Ukraine -- making good on a key promise last year to Kyiv, which has struggled to gain parity in the air with Russia.</p>

<p>He earlier announced new air defense systems for Ukraine and said the United States had agreed to place long-range missiles periodically in Germany.</p>

<p>US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the F-16 transfer "concentrates Vladimir Putin's mind on the fact that he will not outlast Ukraine, he will not outlast us and, if he persists, the damage that will continue to be done to Russia and its interests will only deepen."</p>

<p>But Donald Trump, who is edging out Biden in recent polls, has mused about bringing a quick peace settlement by forcing Ukraine to surrender territory to Russia.</p>

<p>The Republican mogul has repeatedly questioned the utility of NATO -- formed in 1949 as collective defense against Moscow -- which he sees as an unfair burden on the United States.</p>

<p><strong>- 'Terror must fail' -</strong><br />
On the eve of the summit, Russia fired a barrage of missiles on Ukraine, killing dozens, including in Kyiv where a children's hospital was reduced to debris.</p>

<p>Biden invited to the summit Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who voiced gratitude for the F-16s.</p>

<p>The new aircraft will "bring just and lasting peace closer, demonstrating that terror must fail," Zelensky wrote on social media.</p>

<p>The summit aimed in part to "Trump-proof" the alliance including by giving NATO a greater role, rather than the United States, in coordinating arms delivery into Ukraine.</p>

<p>In a joint declaration, NATO leaders promised to give Ukraine 40 billion euros ($43 billion) in military aid "within the next year" -- part of efforts to increase predictability, after Trump's allies in Congress held up US assistance for months.</p>

<p>Stoltenberg insisted that NATO also wanted to end the war but with a Ukrainian victory.</p>

<p>"The quickest way to end a war is to lose a war," Stoltenberg told reporters.</p>

<p>Trump's aides have discussed conditioning aid to Ukraine on forcing Kyiv to the negotiating table and said that China, not Russia, is a larger concern to US interests.</p>

<p>The NATO leaders' statement took aim at China by voicing "profound concern" over its industrial support to Russia.</p>

<p>Biden has also invited four key Pacific partners -- Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand -- as he seeks to increase NATO's role in Asia.</p>

<p>- 'Irreversible' Ukraine path to NATO -<br />
The summit stepped up promises to Ukraine, saying that it was on an "irreversible path to full Euro-Atlantic integration, including NATO membership."</p>

<p>Ukraine has for years sought but failed to win membership in NATO, which considers an attack on one an attack on all.</p>

<p>But Biden and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz have led concerns that bringing in Ukraine would effectively be entering war with nuclear-armed Russia as it occupies swathes of Ukraine.</p>

<p>President Alexander Stubb of Finland -- which, like Sweden, joined NATO following Russia's invasion of Ukraine -- hailed the language as a message to Putin that he is failing in his goal of pushing back the alliance.</p>

<p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, visiting days after his Labour Party swept to power, promised Zelensky that Britain -- unlike the United States -- was united across partisan lines on supporting Ukraine.</p>

<p>Starmer made clear he had no issue with Ukraine using UK missiles to strike into Russian territory, remarks that drew a rebuke from Moscow.</p>

<p>The summit, Starmer told reporters, is showing Putin that NATO is "bigger now than it's ever been, more united than it's ever been, and absolutely clear-eyed about the threat of Russian aggression."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Elon Musk on Wednesday said his Neuralink startup is "moving on" to a second test patient as its tech for linking brains and computers improves.</p>

<p>Musk and members of the Neuralink team fielded questions during an update streamed on X, formerly Twitter, discussing where it is on the path to making its brain implants commonplace.</p>

<p>"We're only just moving now to our second Neuralink patient," Musk said. "But we hope to have, if things go well, high single digits this year."</p>

<p>Musk's neurotechnology company in January installed a brain implant in Noland Arbaugh, which the billionaire head of Tesla and X touted as a success.</p>

<p>Arbaugh was left paralyzed from the shoulders down by a diving accident eight years ago.</p>

<p>Since the implant operation, he has told of playing chess and the video game "Civilization," as well as taking Japanese and French lessons by controlling a computer screen cursor with his brain.</p>

<p>Musk and members of the Neuralink team detailed fixing an issue that saw Arbaugh's ability to move a computer cursor with his mind greatly reduced.</p>

<p>Neuralink's technology works through a device about the size of five stacked coins that is placed inside the human brain by a robotic surgeon.</p>

<p>Threads connecting the implant to Arbaugh's brain had "retracted," becoming less effective at picking up signals.</p>

<p>Threads will be implanted deeper in the brain and at varying depths, with ramped-up precision to maximize effectiveness, according to the Neuralink team.</p>

<p>Musk promised "it's only going to get better from here."</p>

<p>One goal is to escalate the bandwidth of the link between the brain and computer, allowing more data to move faster, according to Musk.</p>

<p>"Quite important for human-AI symbiosis is just being able to communicate at a speed AI can follow," Musk said of brains being connected to computers with artificial intelligence.</p>

<p>Musk envisions Neuralink implants going beyond restoring sight to the blind to giving people infrared or ultraviolet vision or letting them share concepts with others telepathically.</p>

<p>"We want to give people superpowers," Musk said. "Not just that we're restoring your prior functionality, but that you actually have functionality far greater than a normal human."</p>

<p>Musk spoke of developing an automated process in which Neuralink's surgery robot could quickly install custom implants in people seeking "upgrades."</p>

<p>"It's very sort of 'Cyberpunk' or 'Deus Ex,' if you play those games," Musk said of the idea.</p>

<p>"An exciting possibility long term also is to take parts of the Optimus humanoid robot and combine that with a Neuralink - you could have basically cybernetic superpowers," he said.</p>

<p>Musk cofounded Neuralink in 2016.</p>

<p>The ambition is to supercharge human capabilities, treat neurological disorders like ALS or Parkinson's, and maybe one day achieve a symbiotic relationship between humans and AI.</p>

<p>Musk is not alone in trying to make advances in the field, which is officially known as brain-machine or brain-computer interface research.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez on Wednesday urged the West to reject "double standards" regarding the conflict in Gaza as he joined NATO leaders in supporting Ukraine.</p>

<p>Spain under Sanchez has infuriated Israel's right-wing government by recognizing a Palestinian state and criticizing Israel's conduct of its war against Hamas.</p>

<p>"If we are telling our people that we are supporting Ukraine because we are defending the international law, this is the same to what we have to do towards Gaza," he said at NATO's 75th anniversary summit in Washington.</p>

<p>The socialist leader said there should be a "consistent political position" in which "we don't have double standards."</p>

<p>Sanchez said the world needed to press to "stop this terrible humanitarian crisis" affecting the Palestinians and called for an international peace conference to push for a Palestinian state.</p>

<p>"We need to create the conditions for an immediate and urgent ceasefire," he said. "There is a real risk of escalation to Lebanon."</p>

<p>Sanchez said he also supported "democracy, freedom and the right to exist of a country such as Ukraine."</p>

<p>NATO leaders at the summit issued a declaration that said Kyiv was on an "irreversible" path to join the alliance.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>New Prime Minister Keir Starmer promised Wednesday to keep up Britain's steadfast support for Ukraine and gave his blessing for strikes inside Russia with British missiles as he made his international debut at a NATO summit in Washington.</p>

<p>Starmer's unstinting message of continuity on Ukraine comes as questions grow over Kyiv's most vital partner, the United States, where presidential contender Donald Trump has mused about cutting a quick deal with Russia.</p>

<p>Days after his Labour Party swept elections and threw out the Conservatives in power for 14 years, Starmer said he had a "very good" meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on the sidelines of NATO's 75th anniversary summit.</p>

<p>"I made it absolutely clear that as far as the UK is concerned, the change of government makes no difference to the support that we will provide," Starmer told reporters.</p>

<p>"We'd been united on this when we were in opposition, and it was really important to me to be able to affirm that face to face at the meeting," said Starmer, who already spoke to Zelensky by telephone after entering Downing Street.</p>

<p>On his flight to Washington, Starmer said that decisions on the use of British-supplied Storm Shadow missiles were for the Ukrainian armed forces to make.</p>

<p>UK military aid is "for defensive purposes but it is for Ukraine to decide how to deploy it for those defensive purposes," he said.</p>

<p>Britain under three Conservative prime ministers has been among the staunchest supporters of Ukraine in the war, taking the lead in pushing for more advanced military systems and looser restrictions on Kyiv.</p>

<p>US President Joe Biden, who has strongly backed Ukraine but has been careful not to start a direct conflict with Russia, recently made a similar move by letting Ukraine strike Russian offensive positions just across the border with US weapons.</p>

<p>Zelensky hailed the decision on the Storm Shadow missiles, writing on Telegram, "Thank you for your continued support of Ukraine and our people!"</p>

<p>Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov warned that Russia will take "appropriate measures" in response to Starmer's decision.</p>

<p>"If it is true, it is certainly another absolutely irresponsible step towards fueling tensions and seriously escalating the situation," Peskov told reporters.</p>

<p><strong>- 'Clear-eyed' on Russia -</strong></p>

<p>Starmer will meet later with Biden at the White House, and spoke with other Western leaders including French President Emmanuel Macron.</p>

<p>Starmer has taken Labour on a more centrist path than his leftist predecessor and, along with his foreign and defense secretaries, all noted in Washington that Britain helped found NATO in 1949 under Labour prime minister Clement Atlee.</p>

<p>Starmer said he hoped the NATO summit would send a message to Russian President Vladimir Putin that the alliance is "bigger now than it's ever been, more united than it's ever been, and absolutely clear-eyed about the threat of Russian aggression."</p>

<p>A NATO summit in Britain in 2014 set a goal of each ally contributing at least two percent of GDP to defense, a long-running demand of the United States.</p>

<p>Only the United States, Britain and Greece then met the target but since the invasion of Ukraine the number has gone up to 23 members of the 32-nation alliance.</p>

<p>Britain's new defense secretary, John Healey, called for NATO to consider moving toward a 2.5 percent goal.</p>

<p>The growing threats around the world suggest that "all NATO nations are going to need to do more than simply two percent," Healey told reporters.</p>

<p>He said, whatever the result of the US election, Washington's priorities are "increasingly going to shift to the Indo-Pacific."</p>

<p>"European nations in NATO must do more of the heavy lifting," Healey said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NATO leaders on Wednesday said China's deepening ties with Russia are a cause of "deep concern" and accused Beijing of playing a key role in helping Moscow's assault on Ukraine.&nbsp;</p>

<p>China "has become a decisive enabler of Russia's war against Ukraine through its so-called 'no limits' partnership and its large-scale support for Russia's defense industrial base," NATO leaders said in a declaration from their summit in Washington.&nbsp;</p>

<p>NATO leaders urged China "to cease all material and political support to Russia's war effort."</p>

<p>"This includes the transfer of dual-use materials, such as weapons components, equipment, and raw materials that serve as inputs for Russia's defense sector," the declaration said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>China "cannot enable the largest war in Europe in recent history without this negatively impacting its interests and reputation," the alliance said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The statement came before the leaders of Australia, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea are set to attend the NATO summit on Thursday.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Washington represents the third year in a row that leaders from the four Asia-Pacific partners will be at a NATO summit.</p>

<p>Beijing has already angrily rejected the accusations from NATO, and says the US-led alliance is seeking an excuse to expand its influence eastwards.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The United States has been pushing its European allies for years to pay closer attention to the threats posed by China.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I think the message sent from NATO from this summit is very strong and very clear, and we are clearly defining China's responsibility when it comes to enabling Russia's war," NATO's outgoing Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday said India has given 'Buddha' to the world, not 'Yuddha' (war) which means it has always given peace and prosperity, and therefore the country is going to strengthen its role in the 21st century.</p>

<p>Addressing the Indian community in Vienna, PM Modi also said that India is working towards being the best, the brightest, achieving the biggest and reaching the highest milestones.</p>

<p>"For thousands of years, we have been sharing our knowledge and expertise. We didn't give 'Yuddha' (war), we gave the world 'Buddha'. India always gave peace and prosperity, and therefore India is going to strengthen its role in the 21st century," PM Modi said in Austria, a day after he arrived here from Moscow where he highlighted the importance of finding a peaceful solution to the Ukraine conflict during his talks with President Vladimir Putin.</p>

<p>Describing his first visit to Austria as "meaningful", PM Modi said that after 41 years, an Indian Prime Minister has visited the country.</p>

<p>"This long wait has come to an end on a historic occasion. India and Austria are celebrating 75 years of their friendship," he said.</p>

<p>"India and Austria are geographically on two different ends, but we have many similarities. Democracy connects both countries. Our shared values are liberty, equality, pluralism, and respect for the rule of law. Our societies are multicultural and multilingual. Both countries celebrate diversity, and a big medium to reflect these values are elections," he said, amid chants of 'Modi, Modi'.</p>

<p>Recalling the recently concluded general elections, PM Modi said 650 million people exercised their right to vote and despite such a big election, the results of the elections were declared within hours.</p>

<p>"It is the power of our electoral machinery and democracy," he said.</p>

<p>More than 31,000 Indians are living in Austria. The number of Indian students in the country is more than 450, according to the Indian embassy here.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Elections are taking place in major democracies across the globe, incorporating almost half of the world's population. The United States will go to polls in November. Halfway through the year, elections have taken place in Russia, South Korea, the European Union, Belgium, Mexico, Pakistan, France, and Taiwan. India, the world's largest democracy, concluded the electoral exercise in human history.</p>

<p>Interestingly, a report from Pew Research suggests that high-income nations, mostly in the West, are dissatisfied with the way democracy is working in their country.</p>

<h2><strong>Who All Are Dissatisfied?</strong></h2>

<p>The Pew Research Center conducted over 900 interviews in 27 countries and asked respondents, "How satisfied are you with the democracy working in your country?"</p>

<p>In North America, 68 per cent of people are dissatisfied with the current functioning of democracy. The decline in satisfaction witnessed since 2021, shows a 10 per cent dip in the US. In Mexico, an equal percentage of respondents were satisfied and dissatisfied. In Canada under Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, only 52 per cent of people are okay with the functioning of democracy.&nbsp;<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/06/18/satisfaction-with-democracy-has-declined-in-recent-years-in-high-income-nations/sr_2024-06-18_satisfaction-democracy_3/"><em>Read the full report here</em></a></p>

<p>In Europe, only Sweden fared well, with 75 per cent of respondents feeling satisfied with the way democracy is. Interestingly, France, one of the oldest democracies in the world saw 35 per cent pleased. &nbsp;Greece was the lowest at 22 per cent.</p>

<p>In Asia, only Singapore and India reported over 75% satisfaction. In India, 77 per cent were satisfied with the way democracy is. In Singapore, the percentage stands at 80 per cent. Japan was at the lowest at 31 per cent.</p>

<p>Out of 27 countries, over 50 per cent of respondents in 11 countries are satisfied with democracy. Respondents from 11 countries in the west out of 17, are not majorly not satisfied.</p>

<p>The UK saw a major shift in political inclination with the Conservatives under Rishi Sunak voted out and Keir Starmer's Labour securing a landslide win after 13 years. In France, a major political turmoil is being witnessed as the &nbsp;National Assembly delivered a hung parliament, making it hard to know who will be in key government positions.</p>

<p>In the US, Joe Biden is seeking another term amid concerns over his health, while Donald Trump, who is facing legal troubles, is hoping to come back to power.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Claudia Sheinbaum was elected Mexico's first woman president by a landslide, making history in a country plagued by rampant criminal and gender-based violence.</p>

<p>Putin tightened its grip on Russia with a reelection which saw little to no opposition. He has been in power since the last day of 1999, he is now on course to become the longest-serving Russian leader in more than two centuries.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>After meeting PM Modi, the Austrian scientist said he experienced that PM Modi is a very spiritual person.</p>

<p>"I think this is the feature that many leaders in the world should have today," said Mr Zeilinger.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some 1.45 million Afghan refugees in Pakistan will be allowed to stay for another year, Islamabad said Wednesday, but it insisted evictions of undocumented migrants would continue.</p>

<p>More than 600,000 Afghans have fled Pakistan since Islamabad last year ordered undocumented migrants to leave or face arrest as relations with Kabul soured over security.</p>

<p>Human rights monitors warned those sent to Taliban-ruled Afghanistan were given little support and some faced persecution by Kabul's new rulers.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif's cabinet said it approved an extension until June 2025 for the 1.45 million Afghan refugees legally residing in the country who hold Proof of Registration cards.</p>

<p>The cards expired at the end of last month, leaving holders without legal certainty about their right to remain in Pakistan.</p>

<p>Not all Afghan citizens in Pakistan have such cards and even those who do hold them have reported being harassed and intimidated to leave the country.</p>

<p>Islamabad's announcement came the day after a three-day visit by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), Filippo Grandi.</p>

<p>In a statement on Tuesday, the UNHCR said Grandi "expressed appreciation that the 'Illegal Foreigners Repatriation Plan' had been suspended".</p>

<p>However a foreign office spokeswoman said "this is not true".</p>

<p>Mumtaz Zahra Baloch told reporters in a statement: "No such understanding has been given by Pakistan to the UNHCR" and the scheme "remains in place and is being implemented in an orderly and phased manner".</p>

<p>Meanwhile, a Pakistani immigration official at the Torkham border crossing said they had begun seizing documents, including refugee registration cards, from departing Afghans.</p>

<p>"We are implementing this directive following instructions from the Ministry of Interior," said the official at the busiest crossing between Pakistan and Afghanistan.</p>

<p>"This measure aims to ensure they do not return to Pakistan and instead depart permanently, though they may re-enter after obtaining a visa," he told AFP on condition of anonymity.</p>

<p>Millions of Afghans have poured into Pakistan over the years, fleeing decades of cascading conflict.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A court in the United Arab Emirates has handed life sentences to 43 Emiratis for "terrorist" links, state media said Wednesday, after a mass trial heavily criticised by UN experts and rights groups.</p>

<p>Government critics and human rights activists were among the 84 defendants brought before the Abu Dhabi Federal Court of Appeal, most of whom have been in jail since a similar trial of 94 people in 2013, according to rights groups.</p>

<p>The Abu Dhabi court "sentenced 43 defendants to life imprisonment for the crime of creating, establishing, and managing a terrorist organisation" linked to the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood, the official WAM news agency said.</p>

<p>Ten others were jailed for 10-15 years, WAM said, with one defendant acquitted and 24 cases ruled inadmissible. It did not give details of the remaining cases.</p>

<p>Defendants can still appeal the verdicts before the Federal Supreme Court.</p>

<p>The trial, which kicked off in December, has been condemned by rights groups and United Nations experts who accuse the oil-rich Gulf monarchy of cracking down on dissent.</p>

<p>Most of the defendants have already been in prison for more than a decade since the "UAE 94" trial 11 years ago, according to Human Rights Watch (HRW) and Amnesty International.</p>

<p>But UAE authorities say the latest charges are "materially distinct" from those brought in 2013, which did not include accusations of financing a "terrorist organisation".</p>

<p>- 'Violent events' -</p>

<p>The UAE has not named the 84 defendants but the Emirates Detainees Advocacy Center, a UK-based watchdog, has identified more than 70 people, most of them already imprisoned.</p>

<p>The latest verdict makes a "mockery of justice", said Joey Shea, HRW's UAE researcher, calling it "another nail in the coffin for the UAE's nascent civil society".</p>

<p>Among those sentenced to life in prison is Emirati academic Nasser bin Ghaith who has been held since August 2015 over social media posts, according to Shea.</p>

<p>Renowned human rights defender Ahmed Mansoor who has been held since 2017 is also likely among thos convicted, though the details of his sentence remain unclear, Shea said.</p>

<p>Amnesty International called it a "shameless parody of justice," alleging fair trial violations.</p>

<p>"Trying 84 Emiratis at once, including 26 prisoners of conscience and well-known human rights defenders is a scarcely disguised exercise in punishing dissenters," said Devin Kenney, Amnesty's UAE Researcher.</p>

<p>The UAE has denied any wrongdoing.</p>

<p>WAM said the court had "guaranteed the defendants all their rights".</p>

<p>The report said they were trying to "create and replicate violent events" that would have left "dead and injured in the squares and streets".</p>

<p>- 'Deeply regressive' -</p>

<p>The UAE, a federation of seven absolute monarchies, prohibits criticism of its rulers and any speech that is deemed to create or encourage social unrest.</p>

<p>Defamation as well as verbal and written insults, whether published or made privately, are crimes punishable by fines and imprisonment.</p>

<p>In 2012, in the wake of the so-called Arab Spring revolts across the Middle East, the UAE launched a spate of arrests and prosecutions targeting dozens of Emirati dissidents who demanded political reform.</p>

<p>About 60 of the "UAE 94" put on trial then remain behind bars for alleged links to the Muslim Brotherhood, an Islamist movement that is outlawed in the Gulf state.</p>

<p>In a letter sent to UAE authorities in January, independent UN experts said they were concerned that the latest proceedings against the 84 defendants reflect "a broader pattern of suppression of dissent and civil society in the UAE".</p>

<p>They questioned "alleged irregularities" such as "the use of torture or other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment to extract forced confessions".</p>

<p>Ben Saul, the UN's special rapporteur on human rights and counter-terrorism, said the latest charges "relate to the same conduct for which many of these defendants were tried the first time around a decade ago".</p>

<p>The trial was a "deeply regressive step" and a "terrible example of the misuse of counter-terrorism measures against civil society", he told an expert panel hosted by the Geneva Press Club in March.</p>

<p>Last week, HRW said many of the defendants have been kept incommunicado for at least a year and have reported abuses including physical assault, lack of access to medicine, incessant loud music and forced nudity.</p>

<p>The wealthy country's allies, including the United States, Britain and the European Union, should speak out about the "unfair mass trial", HRW said.</p>

<p>"Emirati authorities have long used their country's economic and security relationships to prevent criticism of its rights record, but rarely, if ever, has the silence from its allies been so deafening," said HRW's Shea.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Astronomers have scrutinized a cluster of stars that is the apparent remnant core of a relatively small galaxy that was swallowed by the sprawling Milky Way 8 to 10 billion years ago. What lurks at the center of this cluster has them excited.</p>

<p>The researchers said on Wednesday the unusual motion of seven stars in this cluster provides compelling evidence for the presence of an elusive mid-sized black hole at its heart. These are bigger than the class of ordinary black holes formed in the implosion of a single star but smaller than the behemoths residing at the nucleus of most galaxies.</p>

<p>The cluster, called Omega Centauri, contains about 10 million stars. The black hole within it is at least 8,200 times as massive as our sun, the researchers said.</p>

<p>The supermassive black hole called Sagittarius A* at the center of the Milky Way possesses 4 million times the mass of the sun. And that is dwarfed by supermassive black holes billions of times the mass of the sun in other galaxies.</p>

<p>"There has been a long debate whether intermediate-mass black holes exist in general, and specifically in Omega Centauri, and our detection might help to resolve that debate," said astronomer Maximilian Haberle of the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Germany, lead author of the study published in the journal Nature.</p>

<p>This black hole is located about 17,700 light-years from Earth. A light-year is the distance light travels in a year, 5.9 trillion miles (9.5 trillion km). The Milky Way's only larger-known black hole is Sagittarius A*, located about 26,700 light years from Earth.</p>

<p>Black holes are extraordinarily dense objects with gravity so strong not even light can escape, making it difficult to spot them. This one was detected based on how its gravitational pull influences the velocity of seven fast-moving stars in its vicinity, documented in two decades of Hubble Space Telescope observations.</p>

<p>The researchers believe the smaller galaxy, which had been perhaps 10% the Milky Way's size, harbored a black hole that, if left undisturbed, would have become supermassive as it fed off gas and other nearby material drawn by its gravitational pull. But the galactic merger, which occurred when the Milky Way was about a quarter or third its current age, left the black hole frozen in time.</p>

<p>"In this merger process, the galaxy lost all of its gas, and hence the growth of its central black hole got interrupted, leaving it in an intermediate-mass state," Max Planck Institute for Astronomy astronomer and study co-author Nadine Neumayer said.</p>

<p>The merger stripped away most of the smaller galaxy's stars, leaving just the central batch - now the Omega Centauri star cluster.</p>

<p>"Intermediate-mass black holes have been suspected in the centers of low-mass galaxies or also in the center of certain star clusters. However, they have been very challenging to detect. Due to their lower mass with respect to supermassive black holes, their region of influence is small," Haberle said.</p>

<p>Other candidates for mid-sized black holes have been identified in previous research.</p>

<p>Black holes that are the mass of a single star form when large stars explode at the end of their life cycle and the core collapses in on itself.</p>

<p>"The most likely scenario for the formation of the intermediate-mass black hole at the center of Omega Centauri is the collision and merging of very massive stars very early on during the formation of the star cluster. These stars get very close to each other, collide and form even more massive stars that evolve to black holes fairly rapidly. The intermediate-mass black hole can grow via the merger of several of these black holes," Neumayer said.</p>

<p>These mid-sized black holes may be the key to understanding the formation of the supermassive ones.</p>

<p>"Intermediate-mass black holes are likely very common, especially in the early evolution of the universe," Neumayer said. "They are thought to be the seeds for supermassive black holes."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Emphasising that India and the European Union have "the largest and most vibrant free-market space in the world," India and Austria on Wednesday discussed the India-EU relationship and said the long-pending EU Free Trade Agreement must be expedited.</p>

<p>Noting that deeper EU-India ties will be mutually beneficial as well as have a positive global impact, Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer and Prime Minister Narendra Modi also reaffirmed their strong support for the ongoing India-EU trade and investment negotiations and the early implementation of the EU-India Connectivity Partnership.</p>

<p>PM Modi paid an official two-day visit to Austria at the invitation of Chancellor Nehammer, the first visit to Austria of an Indian Prime Minister after 41 years in a year that marks the 75th year of diplomatic relations between the two countries.</p>

<p>"A set of issues on which both Chancellor and the Prime Minister focused was India-EU relationship, as you know, in their EU Free Trade Agreement (FTA) has been under negotiation for over 23 years," Foreign Secretary Vinay Kwatra said at a media briefing here on PM Modi's visit.</p>

<p>"Prime Minister Modi and the Austrian Chancellor agreed that this was an awfully long time for discussions to have been dragged on and they agreed that this is something that both India and they should try to try in terms of taking it forward at a quicker pace," Mr Kwatra said.</p>

<p>"They of course, also spoke about the range of opportunities both in the economic and political space," he said, adding, "They are in India-EU partnership and also how India-Austria relationship positions synergistically in the overall India-EU relationship."&nbsp;</p>

<p>The EU is India's third largest trading partner, accounting for 88 billion Euros worth of trade in goods in 2021 or 10.8 per cent of total Indian trade. India is the EU's 10th largest trading partner, accounting for 2.1 per cent of EU total trade in goods. Trade in services between the EU and India reached 30.4 billion Euros in 2020, according to the figures available on the EU website.</p>

<p>An India-Austria joint statement at the end of the official state visit said the two leaders emphasised that India and the European Union have the largest and most vibrant free-market space in the world, and noted that deeper EU-India ties will be mutually beneficial as well as have a positive global impact.</p>

<p>"Chancellor Nehammer and Prime Minister Modi agreed to support various initiatives to bring India and the EU closer. In this context, they reaffirmed their strong support for the ongoing India-EU trade and investment negotiations and the early implementation of the EU-India Connectivity Partnership," it said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Actor George Clooney, one of the Democratic Party's leading fundraisers, on Wednesday made an emotional and heartfelt plea for President Joe Biden to end his faltering reelection campaign.</p>

<p>Clooney -- a member of the Hollywood elite that provides key support to the Democrats -- joined a growing list of public figures calling for Biden, 81, to step aside after his terrible debate performance against Donald Trump last month.</p>

<p>"I love Joe Biden," Clooney wrote in the New York Times. "I consider him a friend, and I believe in him... But the one battle he cannot win is the fight against time."</p>

<p>A self-described "lifelong Democrat," Clooney co-hosted a star-studded fundraiser with Biden in Los Angeles only last month featuring former president Barack Obama.</p>

<p>The Biden campaign said that the event brought in a record $28 million.</p>

<p>"It's devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fund-raiser was not the Joe 'big F-ing deal' Biden of 2010," Clooney wrote, referencing a famous hot-mic clip from Biden's vice presidency.</p>

<p>"He wasn't even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate," Clooney said -- a direct challenge to Biden's claim that his poor debate showing was a one-off.</p>

<p>"The dam has broken" on Democratic lawmakers publicly calling for Biden to withdraw, Clooney said, asking more come forward.</p>

<p>"Top Democrats -- Chuck Schumer, Hakeem Jeffries, Nancy Pelosi -- and senators, representatives and other candidates who face losing in November need to ask this president to voluntarily step aside."</p>

<p>The Oscar-winner brushed aside worries that Biden's exit would create chaos four months before an election in which the Democrats hope to keep Trump from power, and did not endorse a replacement candidate.</p>

<p>The party should hear from contenders such as Vice President Kamala Harris, Maryland Governor Wes Moore and others, "then we could go into the Democratic convention next month and figure it out," he wrote.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi's two-day visit to Moscow and the outcomes of his summit talks with President Vladimir Putin were "historic and game-changing" considering the prevailing turbulent geopolitical environment, Russia's Charge d'affaires Roman Babushkin said on Wednesday.</p>

<p>The Russian diplomat said the focus of the talks between the two leaders was on expanding India-Russia trade and economic ties.</p>

<p>In his first trip since the start of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, PM Modi paid a two-day visit to Moscow on July 8 and 9 during which he held summit talks with Putin.</p>

<p>"The leaders have decided to strengthen cooperation in all areas. It is a historic and game-changing move, especially given the turbulent environment around us," Mr Babushkin said at a media briefing.</p>

<p>"It has got unprecedented coverage and presumably overshadowed all other events. It seemed that the whole world was watching it," he said.</p>

<p>Mr Babushkin also criticised the US for making certain comments ahead of PM Modi's visit to Moscow and described the remarks as interference in ties between the two nations.</p>

<p>"It was the conduct of two independent global powers based on mutual trust and respect. The external factors don't play much role when it comes to Russia-India relations," he said.</p>

<p>India and Russia have established foundational convergences in key areas of our cooperation, he said.</p>

<p>The senior diplomat said both sides vowed to expand cooperation in a range of key areas including fossil fuel, nuclear energy and trade.</p>

<p>Highlighting key outcomes of the summit talks, Babushkin said India and Russia decided to go ahead with a bilateral payment system using national currencies.</p>

<p>If you noticed, one of the most important points of the joint statement was that we have decided to go ahead with the establishment of a payment system under the framework of national currency settlement, he said.</p>

<p>In the PM &nbsp;Modi-Putin talks, the two sides set a target of USD 100 billion in annual trade volume by 2030 and vowed to develop a robust bilateral payment settlement mechanism using national currencies.</p>

<p>On India's demand to Russia to ensure the return of Indians working in the Russian Army, he said, "We are on the same page with India on this issue." We hope it will be resolved soon, he said when the Indians return home.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the world grapples with climate change and soaring temperatures, a worrying statistic has come to light - last month was the hottest June ever recorded on earth, according to the European Union's climate agency. Not just that, June also became the 12th consecutive month to surpass the 1.5 degrees celsius threshold for global warming.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The last month was 0.14 degrees warmer than June 2023, said <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://climate.copernicus.eu/copernicus-june-2024-marks-12th-month-global-temperature-reaching-15degc-above-pre-industrial">EU's Copernicus Climate Change Service</a> (C3S) report. The figures from the EU's climate agency highlight that each month over the past year has consistently broken records for unprecedented heat, making it the hottest respective month ever recorded on the planet. While it is an unusual phenomenon, a similar streak of monthly global temperature records happened previously in 2015-2016.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The 1.5 degrees global warming mark was internationally accepted in the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://unfccc.int/files/essential_background/convention/application/pdf/english_paris_agreement.pdf">2015 Paris agreement</a>, where the world leaders of over 200 nations agreed to limit the increase in global average temperature to 1.5 degrees Celsius over pre-industrial levels to reduce the risks and impacts of climate change. &nbsp;</p>

<p>According to C3S Director Carlo Buontempo, the record-breaking temperatures in the last one year point to a "large and continuing shift in our climate." "Even if this specific streak of extremes ends at some point, we are bound to see new records being broken as the climate continues to warm. This is inevitable, unless we stop adding [greenhouse gases] into the atmosphere and the oceans," he said in a statement. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The new concerning figures also point out that 2024 could surpass 2023 as the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/2024-could-be-worlds-hottest-year-as-june-breaks-records-6063105">hottest year ever </a>recorded, said a report by news agency Reuters.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to Zeke Hausfather, a research scientist at US non-profit Berkeley Earth, there is an approximately 95% chance that 2024 beats 2023 to be the warmest year since global surface temperature records began in the mid-1800s.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The soaring temperatures across the globe brought with them devastating consequences. Over 1,300 people reportedly died during Hajj this year, said Saudi Arabia.&nbsp;</p>

<p>India reported over 40,000 cases of suspected heat stroke and over 100 heat-related deaths during the relentless and continuous heatwave. According to the Centre for Holistic Development, a non-governmental organization, as many as 192 homeless deaths were reported in Delhi during June 11-19.<br />

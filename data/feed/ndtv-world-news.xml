<p>Hours before Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah was killed in an airstrike in Lebanon's Beirut, an Iranian mole informed Israeli authorities of his location, French newspaper Le Parisien has reported.</p>

<p>Citing a security source in Lebanon, the report said the mole had informed Israeli authorities that Nasrallah would be at Hezbollah's underground headquarters in Beirut's southern suburbs to attend a meeting with several top members of the organisation.</p>

<p>Around 1.30 pm IST yesterday (11 am Lebanon time), Israel Defence Forces said in a post on X, "Hassan Nasrallah will no longer be able to terrorize the world." Later in the day, Hezbollah confirmed the news. "Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah... has joined his great, immortal martyr comrades whom he led for about 30 years," it said in a statement.</p>

<p><strong>How Israel Boosted Spies In Fight Against Hezbollah</strong></p>

<p>According to a report in The New York Times, Israel's recent successes against Hezbollah are a direct result of the country's decision to devote far more intelligence resources to target Hezbollah after the 2006 war with the Iran-backed group. The Israeli army and the intelligence agencies, the report said, failed to score a decisive victory in that 34-day conflict. The war ended with a UN-brokered cease-fire and allowed Hezbollah, despite losses, to regroup and prepare for the next war.</p>

<p>In the years that followed, Israel deployed a lot of resources to collect information about Hezbollah's leadership and strategy. Unit 8200, Israel's signals intelligence agency, built cutting-edge cyber tools to better intercept Hezbollah's cellphones and other communications, the NYT report said. New teams were created within combat ranks to ensure that valuable information was quickly passed on to soldiers and the air force, it added.</p>

<p><strong>The Pager Bombs And Nasrallah's Admission</strong></p>

<p>In a recent televised speech, Nasrallah had said Hezbollah suffered an "unprecedented blow" after Israel detonated explosive-laden pagers and hand-held radios. The attacks killed 37 people and wounded nearly 3,000 people in two days. Nasrallah had then warned Israel of "tough retribution and just punishment, where it expects it and where it does not".</p>

<p>A Lebanese investigation found that the pagers had been booby-trapped, AFP reported.</p>

<p>Hezbollah members had started communicating via pagers and walkie-talkies after Israel penetrated cellphones. But that did not protect them.</p>

<p>The Mossad, the NYT report said, appears to have created a shell company in Budapest and made the pagers under license from a company in Taiwan. Before the pagers arrived in Lebanon, Israeli operatives installed explosives inside them. The operation was scaled to produce thousands of pagers, requiring sophisticated manufacturing, it said.</p>

<p><strong>Top Hezbollah Leaders Targeted</strong></p>

<p>According to the NYT report, Israel's investment in greater intelligence gathering first paid off in 2008 when Mossad worked with the CIA to kill top Hezbollah operative, Imad Mugniyah, in Syria. In 2020, Qassim Suleimani, who headed Iran's Quds Force, flew to Syria's Damascus and drove in a convoy to Beirut to meet Nasrallah. Israel did not try to kill Nasrallah then for fear of starting a war. It passed on the information to the US and Suleimani was killed in a drone strike at Baghdad airport, the report said.</p>

<p>The October 7 attacks by Hamas on Israeli cities set off the ongoing conflict in the Middle East. As Israel's counterstrike set off a war in Gaza, Hezbollah started targeting Israel.</p>

<p>Over the past couple of months, Tel Aviv went all-out against Hezbollah. A strike on July 30 killed Fuad Shukr, one of the group's top military commanders. About three weeks later, a strike killed Ibrahim Aqil, head of Hezbollah's elite Radwan Force, and 15 other commanders. Days later, another strike killed Ibrahim Mohammed Kobeissi, who commanded several Hezbollah units, including a guided missiles unit. The next day, Mohammed Srur, the head of Hezbollah's drone unit, was killed in a strike.</p>

<p>Chip Usher, a former CIA analyst who has worked with Israeli intelligence, has told NYT, "The secrets of their success come down to a couple of factors. They have a fairly defined target deck. That makes it easier for them to bring a tremendous amount of focus to what they do. They're in a shadow war with Hezbollah and Iran. And they're extraordinarily patient."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A mystery dating back over three millennia is being unravelled in the Tollense River Valley of northeast Germany.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A mystery dating back over three millennia is being unravelled in the Tollense River Valley of northeast Germany. What seems like a peaceful landscape today was once the site of a fierce and bloody confrontation that archaeologists now identify as Europe's oldest-known battlefield.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It all began in 1996 when an amateur archaeologist stumbled upon a human bone protruding from the riverbank. This small discovery sparked a much larger investigation, and excavations that began in 2008 have since revealed thousands of skeletal remains and hundreds of weapons, preserved by the valley's pristine environment. Experts now estimate that these remnants belonged to a large-scale battle that took place around 1,250 BCE, during the late Bronze Age.</p>

<p>While much of the ancient conflict remains a puzzle, the meticulous analysis of newly uncovered artefacts has brought researchers closer to understanding who fought in this brutal clash and why. One of the most intriguing discoveries is the presence of arrowheads – some locally produced, and others from regions far to the south.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A recent analysis of dozens of arrowheads found at the site, some still embedded in human bones, has provided critical new insights. The comparison of the shapes and materials of the weapons reveals that while many were made locally, others bore distinctly southern characteristics, originating from regions as far away as present-day Bavaria and Moravia.</p>

<p>The discovery of these southern arrowheads suggests that an army from the south clashed with local northern tribes in the valley. Researchers believe this battle could have occurred near a key landmark along the Tollense River, a place that might have been strategically significant for control over trade or territory.</p>

<p>Though the exact motivations behind the battle remain elusive, the presence of distant armies in what was once considered a local tribal skirmish indicates a much larger, organised conflict. This may rewrite the history of inter-regional relations in Bronze Age Europe.</p>

<p>The Tollense Valley battlefield offers an unprecedented glimpse into a period when organised warfare was becoming more common in Europe. With thousands of bodies scattered across the site, the scale of the conflict is far greater than what was previously thought possible for the time. Archaeologists have uncovered evidence of brutal injuries, including skull fractures and stab wounds, as well as the remains of horses and military equipment.</p>

<p>While excavations continue at the Tollense site, the power of modern technology is helping archaeologists make even more groundbreaking discoveries. Tools like artificial intelligence (AI) and satellite imagery are being employed to scan the valley and surrounding areas, searching for hidden sites that might provide further clues to the nature of the conflict.</p>

<p>The discovery of southern arrowheads at the Tollense site raises more questions than it answers. Why would warriors travel hundreds of kilometres to engage in battle here? What were they fighting for? And why was this battle so significant that it left behind such a vast number of dead?</p>

<p>Researchers continue to study the remains and artefacts from the battlefield in hopes of piecing together a more complete picture. One hypothesis is that the battle may have been part of a broader struggle for control over trade routes that passed through the region. The Tollense River, after all, could have been a key artery for transporting goods, making it a valuable prize for any power looking to expand its influence.</p>

<p>For now, the arrowheads and bones scattered across the valley are silent witnesses to a forgotten war.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A farmer in northern Thailand was forced to cull more than 100 crocodiles from his farm as heavy floods raised fears that they could escape and pose a threat to human lives. Natthapak Khumkad, the owner of a crocodile farm in Lamphun, explained that days of relentless rain had severely damaged the enclosures holding his Siamese crocodiles.</p>

<p>With the animals at risk of escaping, he decided to kill 125 crocodiles, which measured up to three meters long. Mr Khumkad was particularly concerned that the reptiles might roam the flooded countryside, potentially attacking locals and animals.</p>

<p>The incident, reported by CNN on Friday, took place in the Lamphun province following devastating monsoon rains that have swept across the region. In September, northern Thailand was hit by intense monsoon rains, which resulted in landslides and floods that killed over 20 people.</p>

<p>"I had to make the most difficult decision of my life to kill them all. My family and I discussed if the wall collapsed the damage to people's lives would be far bigger than we can control. It would involve people's lives and public safety," the farmer told CNN.</p>

<p>In a Facebook post, Natthapak Khumkad showed the eroded walls of the crocodile pond and explained, "This was the primary reason that forced me to make an urgent decision. On that day, it rained heavily non-stop. The underwater wall collapsed, which was very close to reaching the outer wall."</p>

<p>He clarified that although his staff attempted to block off the area to fix the pond as soon as possible, the unceasing rain made the situation dangerous.</p>

<p>"It was a crisis that required an extremely urgent decision. I had to use the last resort, which was to remove the crocodiles from the farm by slaughtering them. If it wasn't absolutely necessary, we wouldn't have used this method. It was the best, fastest, and safest method in that situation, with the rain still pouring incessantly. Thank you for all the encouragement and understanding.,"&nbsp;Natthapak added.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Indian-origin doctor and former COVID-19 czar of New York City, Jay Varma is facing severe criticism for lying under oath by testifying that vaccination is the sole means of stopping the spread of coronavirus. This comes after hidden-camera footage surfaced, revealing Mr Varma, the&nbsp;former COVID czar of New York City, boasting about attending drug-fuelled sex parties during the pandemic.</p>

<p>Jay Varma, who was a senior health advisor to ex-Mayor Bill de Blasio during the height of the pandemic, confessed in newly released footage that natural immunity to the virus is equally effective as vaccination. “It doesn't make any difference at all... Everybody's been exposed to the virus. Whether you're exposed to the virus because it's breathed on you or because you got injected into you. It's the same immune response,” he said, as per the NY Post.&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DulLO6C0Dik?si=PED24gIrguT2TC58" title="YouTube video player" width="560"></iframe></p>

<p>However, during multiple lawsuits against COVID mandates, Mr Varma provided contradictory testimony, in which he said, “The COVID-19 vaccine has been shown to offer those persons with a prior COVID-19 infection greater protection against reinfection.”</p>

<p>The controversy arose after the footage, filmed by a hidden camera and released by podcaster Steven Crowder, showed Mr Varma discussing the limitations of vaccine mandates. Critics have since accused him of providing false testimony, leading to a growing call for legal action.</p>

<p>Councilwoman Joann Ariola (R-Queens) has accused Mr Varma of perjury, or, lying under oath, and emphasised that his misleading testimony led to vaccination mandates that harmed many New Yorkers. Ms Ariola said, “Dr. Varma swore under oath that the vaccine was the most effective way to prevent the spread of new COVID strains, but in captured footage, he privately acknowledges that there was, in reality, no difference between vaccinations and natural immunity,” Ariola said. “This is outright perjury . . . perjury that cost thousands their livelihoods – and he must be held accountable for his actions.”</p>

<p>Jay Varma has not publicly responded to the allegations, though he previously described the hidden-camera footage as “spliced, diced, and taken out of context.” He was also recently <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/indians-abroad/dr-jay-varma-fired-from-job-after-revelations-of-pandemic-era-sex-parties-6644220 ">fired from SIGA Technologies</a>&nbsp;after revelations of his involvement in drug-fuelled sex parties during the pandemic.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In what would become his final speech on September 19, Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah denounced Israel's deadly attacks across Lebanon and framed the situation as a potential “declaration of war.” The chief of the Iran-backed group vowed retaliation, asserting that the Israeli aggressions would be met with “a just punishment.”</p>

<p>This speech came just days before Israeli forces targeted Hezbollah's central headquarters in an airstrike, killing Nasrallah and senior Hezbollah commander Ibrahim Aqil.</p>

<p>During his address, Nasrallah reflected on the recent Israeli strikes that killed 32 people and destroyed Hezbollah's communication networks, including radios and pagers across Lebanon. He described the situation as “big tests” and said that “the important thing is to not let the blow knock you down.” He also added that with faith in God, Hezbollah would emerge from this crisis “with heads raised high.”</p>

<p>“The important thing is to not let the blow knock you down, no matter how big and strong it is, and I tell you with all reassurance, confidence and reliance on God that this big, strong and unprecedented bow did not knock us down and will not knock us down, God willing,” Nasrallah said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Nasrallah's rhetoric was aimed not only at Israel but also in support of Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank. “We say to the enemy's government, army and society, that the Lebanese front will not stop before the aggression on Gaza stops,” he said. “We have been saying this for 11 months.”</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" height="281" mozallowfullscreen="true" scrolling="no" src="https://www.ndtv.com/videos/embed-player/?id=843197&amp;mute=1&amp;autostart=1&amp;mutestart=true&amp;pWidth=100&amp;pHeight=100" webkitallowfullscreen="true" width="500"></iframe></p>

<p>Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah's speech came amid escalating violence along the Israel-Lebanon border, where Israeli and Hezbollah forces have been clashing since the start of the war in Gaza.</p>

<p>On Friday, September 20, Israel carried out a targeted strike, killing Ibrahim Aqil, the commander of Hezbollah's elite Radwan unit, along with 12 others in Beirut. Aqil had been a senior figure in the organisation and was also wanted by the US for his involvement in the 1983 bombing of the American embassy in Beirut.</p>

<p>The Israeli military described the operation as part of its broader efforts to weaken Hezbollah. As both sides escalated their attacks, fears of a broader war between Israel and Hezbollah intensified, leaving civilians on both sides caught in the crossfire. Residents of border towns in southern Lebanon recounted that the bombardments were the most intense they had witnessed since hostilities began.</p>

<p>International mediators, including US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, have called for restraint to prevent the conflict from spiralling into a full-blown regional war. However, Nasrallah's last speech made clear that Hezbollah would not back down, with the leader's words echoing even after his death: “Whatever the sacrifices, whatever the consequences, the resistance in Lebanon will not stop supporting the people of Gaza and the West Bank who are oppressed in that holy land.”</p>

<p>Israeli airstrikes on Lebanon have killed over 1,000 people and displaced nearly half a million since Monday. Meanwhile, in Gaza, the death count has now risen to nearly 42,000, with almost the entire population of the region displaced due to relentless bombardment. The humanitarian crisis has deepened, with food, water and medical supplies dwindling under the continuous siege.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The alleged crime occurred at a campground in Rogers, where the 21-year-old father, 20-year-old mother, and their baby have been living for approximately three months.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A couple from Northwest Arkansas is accused of attempting to sell their baby boy for $1,000 and beer, according to court documents in the felony case.&nbsp;As detailed in a Benton County Sheriff's Office arrest affidavit, the alleged crime occurred at a campground in Rogers, where Darien Urban, 21, and Shalene Ehlers, and their baby have been living for approximately three months. Rogers is situated in the Ozarks near the borders of Oklahoma and Missouri.</p>

<p>The condition of the baby was not immediately known as of Thursday.</p>

<p>According to the affidavit obtained by<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/09/26/arkansas-couple-sell-baby-for-money-beer-allegations/75393884007/" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em> USA TODAY</em></a>, deputies were called to Beaver Lake Hide Away Campground on September 21 after a report from someone in the manager's office claimed the couple was attempting to give their baby away in exchange for money and beer. The caller also informed authorities that the baby required medical attention due to observed rashes and blisters around the child's buttocks and genitals.</p>

<p>When deputies arrived, a detective noted in the affidavit that the couple was not present, and the baby was taken to a children's hospital.</p>

<p>The affidavit states that one witness approached the couple's camper, asked to take the baby overnight, and provided the couple with beers. The man told deputies that the couple agreed, so he took the baby out of concern for his welfare.</p>

<p>Another witness, a woman at the campground, also took the baby, changed his diaper, and bathed him. She captured photos of the blisters and rash to present to authorities.</p>

<p>On-site, deputies found a letter allegedly signed by the couple, agreeing to accept a cashier's check for $1,000 on Monday in exchange for the child. The letter stated, "I, Darien Urban and Shalene Ehlers are signing our rights over to Cody Nathaniel Martin of our baby boy [redacted] for $1,000 on 09/21/2024," the letter reads. "Disclaimer: After signing this there will be no changing yall two's minds and to never contact again."</p>

<p>Detectives also obtained cellphone video of both parents signing the letter.</p>

<p>During their interview with detectives, the couple claimed their baby "was undergoing an adoption" and stated they recorded the video because they planned to finalize the adoption on Monday, according to the affidavit.</p>

<p>Deputies arrested the couple and booked them into local jail on charges of felony endangering the welfare of a child and attempted relinquishment of a minor for adoption. A judge set their bond at $50,000 each.</p>

<p>Court and jail records indicated that both defendants were released on Thursday.</p>

<p>The parents are scheduled to appear in court on October 29.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A "partial peace" with Armenia is not a possibility, Azerbaijan's foreign minister said Saturday at the UN General Assembly's annual gathering, after Yerevan offered a more optimistic message.</p>

<p>The two former Soviet republics had seen decades of war and tension over Nagorno-Karabakh, a breakaway ethnic Armenian region in Azerbaijan.</p>

<p>After a series of slow-moving negotiations, Azerbaijan rushed in troops last year and swiftly seized back the area, whose entire population of nearly 120,000 people fled to Armenia.</p>

<p>"Partial peace is not an option after so much pain and suffering inflicted by... territorial claims against neighbors," Jeyhun Bayramov told the gathering, insisting in particular on a change to Armenia's constitution, which refers to "reunification" with Nagorno-Karabakh.</p>

<p>Azerbaijan's lightning offensive last year unfolded during the high-level UN meetings in New York, sparking disbelief and chagrin among Western diplomats, especially US and French officials who had been deeply involved in mediation efforts.</p>

<p>On Thursday, Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan said peace with Azerbaijan "not only is possible, but is within reach."</p>

<p>Azerbaijan and Armenia both say that 80 percent of a treaty is ready, including border delineation, but Azerbaijan first wants a resolution of all issues.</p>

<p>In his UN address, Pashinyan said he was ready to meet the Baku government's key demand of allowing transportation access across Armenian soil to the exclave of Nakhchivan, letting Azerbaijan connect its main territory with its traditional ally Turkey.</p>

<p>Pashinyan insisted that Azerbaijan and Armenia should sign the draft treaty immediately, explaining, "There is no precedent of a peace agreement or any agreement that would regulate and solve everything."</p>

<p>But on Saturday, Bayramov said any finalization of a deal would require Armenia to "legally abandon territorial claims against Azerbaijan once and for all through implementing constitutional amendments" so Baku's territorial integrity would not be in "legal limbo."</p>

<p>He also accused Yerevan of making a "dramatic increase" in its military budget and acquiring a "large amount of offensive weaponry from both traditional and new suppliers."</p>

<p>Bayramov nevertheless acknowledged "significant progress" in efforts by the neighbors to normalize relations, calling for "expeditious steps" to complete the process "at this critical moment."</p>

<p>Any changes to Armenia's constitution must be done through a referendum, a long and uncertain process. Western diplomats said they saw the request as a way for Baku to ask for the impossible to avoid signing a deal.</p>

<p>Potentially adding to momentum for a deal is COP29, the annual UN climate change talks that bring together officials from across the world, which will take place in the Azerbaijani capital Baku in November.</p>

<p>The international community is applying added pressure on Baku to reach an agreement before COP29.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A US woman has pleaded guilty to running a high-end sex racket in the greater Boston area and the suburbs of Washington that served politicians, military officers, lawyers, and corporate executives.</p>

<p>Han Lee, 42, appeared in Boston federal court on Friday to plead guilty to charges that she conspired to "persuade, induce and entice" primarily Asian women to travel to Massachusetts and Virginia to engage in prostitution and committed money laundering, prosecutors said.</p>

<p>The Massachusetts resident was arrested and charged in November last year along with Junmyung Lee, 31, and James Lee, 69. They were subsequently indicted by a federal grand jury in February for operating the prostitution racket.</p>

<p>Han Lee faces up to 25 years in prison when she is sentenced in December. She told the judge that while she ran an illegal prostitution business, she did not force any women to engage in sex work.</p>

<h3><strong>How They Operated The Sex Racket</strong></h3>

<p>According to prosecutors, from at least July 2020, Han Lee operated an interstate prostitution network with multiple brothels in Cambridge and Watertown, Massachusetts, and Fairfax and Tysons, Virginia</p>

<p>She established the infrastructure for these brothels in multiple states for the purposes of "persuading, inducing and enticing women - primarily Asian women - to travel to Massachusetts and Virginia to engage in prostitution," prosecutors said.</p>

<p>It is further alleged that Han Lee and her aides coordinated the women's airline travel and transportation and permitted them to stay overnight in the brothel locations so they did not have to find lodging elsewhere, therefore enticing women to participate in their prostitution network.</p>

<p>"To protect and maintain the secrecy of the business and ensure that the women did not draw attention to the prostitution work inside apartment buildings, Han Lee and, allegedly, her co-defendants established house rules for the women during their stays," prosecutors said.</p>

<h3><strong>Charged $350 To $600 For Sex Services</strong></h3>

<p>Han Lee charged sex buyers $350 to $600 per hour depending on the services and only took cash.</p>

<p>They allegedly advertised their prostitution network and offered appointments with women via two websites. Both websites purported to advertise nude models for professional photography at upscale studios as a front for prostitution offered through appointments.</p>

<p>It is further alleged that Han Lee maintained local brothel phone numbers which they used to communicate with verified customers and schedule appointments via text messages; send customers a "menu" of available options at the brothel, including the women and sexual services available and the hourly rate; and to text customers directions to the brothel's location where they engaged in commercial sex with the women.</p>

<p>To conceal the proceeds of the prostitution network, Han Lee deposited hundreds of thousands of dollars of cash proceeds into personal and third-party bank accounts and peer-to-peer transfers, prosecutors said.</p>

<p>It is also alleged that they regularly used hundreds of thousands of dollars of the cash proceeds from the prostitution business to purchase money orders (in values under an amount that would trigger reporting and identification requirements) to conceal the source of the funds.</p>

<p>These money orders were then used to pay for rent and utilities at brothel locations in Massachusetts and Virginia, prosecutors said.</p>

<p>Her clients have so far not been identified but authorities have estimated the network's customer base was in the hundreds and included elected officials, pharmaceutical and technology executives, doctors, military officers, professors, lawyers, business executives, scientists and accountants.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p>

<p>Donald Trump on Saturday called Democrat Kamala Harris "mentally impaired" and said illegal immigrants are out to cut the throats of ordinary Americans in their own homes as he doubled down on the racially charged rhetoric fueling his unprecedented bid to regain the US presidency.</p>

<p>Trump was seeking to strike back at Harris after she visited the US-Mexico border on Friday and vowed to do more to control asylum claims and undocumented migrant crossings.</p>

<p>The issue is one of the Democratic vice president's weakest in polling, as she runs neck-and-neck against Trump in the November 5 election.</p>

<p>Trump dismissed Harris's speech at the border, swearing and telling supporters in the small town of Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin, that President Joe Biden and Harris are responsible for an "invasion" of violent criminals.</p>

<p>Anti-immigrant sentiment has been at the core of Trump's appeal in economically depressed, majority-white parts of the country ever since his 2016 presidential victory, but the rhetoric is turning ever more extreme as election day nears.</p>

<p>The 78-year-old businessman -- the first major presidential candidate in US history to be a convicted felon and subject of multiple ongoing court cases -- said former California prosecutor Harris, 59, is "dumb."</p>

<p>"Joe Biden became mentally impaired. Kamala was born that way. She was born that way. And if you think about it, only a mentally disabled person could have allowed this to happen to our country," he said.</p>

<p>Harris, meanwhile, spent Saturday at a fundraiser in San Francisco, California, where she said Trump was using "the same tired playbook we've heard for years."</p>

<p>"This election is about two very different visions for our nation and we see that contrast on the campaign trail," she said.</p>

<p>Trump spoke in Wisconsin while flanked on stage by large mugshots of migrants accused of crimes, painting a hellish picture of an America under violent assault -- despite a plunge this year in illegal border crossings and what the FBI says is a steep decline in crime overall, particularly murder.</p>

<p>"They will walk into your kitchen, they'll cut your throat," Trump said of illegal immigrants.</p>

<p>"Small towns in America are terrified of migrants coming in and, even when they haven't arrived, they're terrified," he said. They will "rape, pillage, thieve, plunder and kill the people of the United States of America."</p>

<p>The illegal migrants, whom he called "animals," will take the jobs of minorities and of union workers, he added.</p>

<p>Apparently rankled by Harris's bid Friday to deliver a tough message on the Mexican border, Trump cursed on the nationally streamed event and branded her "a liar."</p>

<p>He complained that Fox News, the conservative network which has provided him with a loyal platform throughout his White House career, had covered Harris's speech.</p>

<p>"They shouldn't be allowed to put it on," he said.</p>

<p>Evidently, Trump was aware that his speech was unlike what Americans have been used to in presidential campaigns over the years.</p>

<p>He paused at one point to say: "Isn't this a wonderful and inspiring speech? I've got people sitting in the front row -- they're going 'oh my God.'"</p>

<p>"This is a dark, this is a dark speech," he said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A report that a Nazi song was sung at the funeral of a far-right ex-official in Austria caused outrage on Saturday, on the eve of national elections, for which the far right leads opinion polls.</p>

<p>The far-right Freedom Party (FPOe) -- which was founded by former Nazis -- is in a close race with the ruling conservatives to win Sunday's vote, which would mark a historic victory.</p>

<p>In the lead-up to the vote, FPOe leader Herbert Kickl has frequently employed terms reminiscent of the party's troubled past, including calling himself the future "Volkskanzler" -- the people's chancellor -- as Adolf Hitler was termed in the 1930s.</p>

<p>On Friday, several FPOe officials attended the Vienna funeral of FPOe former district counsellor Walter Sucher, where a Nazi song was sung, the Standard daily reported.</p>

<p>The Standard published a video it had received showing people attending a funeral at a cemetery, and standing by a grave singing a song evoking the "holy German Reich".</p>

<p>The FPOe did not immediately reply to an AFP request for comment, but in comments to Austrian news agency APA it condemned the way the incident had been politicised.</p>

<p>"To now want to politically abuse the funeral of a private person -- in the planning or shaping of which the FPOe was not involved in any way whatsoever -- is disrespectful and shabby," it said.</p>

<p>The Jewish Austrian Students group said it had filed a complaint with prosecutors over the video. In a statement, it called the incident an "alarm signal for Austria".</p>

<p>Political parties across the spectrum have also condemned the video.</p>

<p>In a post on X, the conservative People's Party (OeVP) reiterated it would not cooperate with Kickl -- who has "no qualms being associated with right-wing extremists" -- to form a government, urging people to vote OeVP to "strengthen the centre".</p>

<p>Social Democrats (SPOe) leader Andreas Babler said on X that the incident showed once again that "a democratic state cannot be created" with the FPOe.</p>

<p>The FPOe has frequently faced accusations of anti-Semitism, which it denies.</p>

<p>Under Kickl, the party has built on anger over migration, inflation and Covid restrictions to gain voters. It currently stands at 27 percent of voter support in opinion polls, just ahead of the OeVP at 25 percent.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Twelve pro-Iranian fighters have been killed in air strikes of unknown origin in eastern Syria, a war monitor said Sunday, adding that a large number of people were wounded.</p>

<p>"Twelve pro-Iranian fighters were killed in air strikes of unknown origin targeting their positions in the city of Deir Ezzor and to the east of the city, as well as the Boukamal region, near the border with Iraq," said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.</p>

<p>The strikes were not immediately claimed by any entity, according to the monitor.</p>

<p>Five of the strikes had targeted military positions near Deir Ezzor airport, it added.</p>

<p>Iran has been providing military aid to Syria since the civil war there began in 2011, while Israel has carried out hundreds of strikes targeting pro-Iranian groups in eastern Syria. The United States has also targeted such groups in the country's east.</p>

<p>Israeli authorities rarely comment on individual strikes in Syria, but have repeatedly said they will not allow arch-enemy Iran to expand its presence there.</p>

<p>Israel has launched an intense bombing campaign against Hezbollah strongholds in Lebanon in recent days, intensifying fears of a regional war.</p>

<p>The Israeli army has also repeatedly targeted the movement's arms supply routes on the Syrian-Lebanese border, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The death count from powerful Storm Helene has reached at least 63, authorities said Saturday, as responders, hampered by washed-out bridges and debris-strewn roads, searched house-by-house for survivors in devastated parts of several southern and eastern US states.</p>

<p>At least 24 people died in South Carolina, 17 in Georgia, 11 in Florida, 10 in North Carolina and one in Virginia, according to updated reports from local authorities and media tallied by AFP.</p>

<p>Helene slammed into Florida late Thursday as a Category 4 hurricane and surged north, gradually weakening but leaving a path of destruction.</p>

<p>Federal emergencies were declared in six states -- Alabama, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee -- with more than 800 personnel from the Federal Emergency Management Administration (FEMA) deployed to assist local officials.</p>

<p>Repair crews were already at work Saturday, and the National Weather Service said conditions would "continue to improve today following the catastrophic flooding over the past two days."</p>

<p>But it warned of possible "long-duration power outages."</p>

<p>More than 2.7 million customers were still without electricity across 10 states from Florida in the southeast to Indiana in the midwest as of Saturday night, according to tracker poweroutage.us.</p>

<p><strong>'It breaks my heart'</strong></p>

<p>Helene originally slammed into Florida's northern Gulf shore with powerful winds of 140 miles (225 kilometers) per hour. Even as a weakened post-tropical cyclone, it has caused chaos.</p>

<p>Record levels of flooding had threatened to break through several dams, but Tennessee emergency officials said Saturday that the Nolichucky Dam -- which had been close to breaching -- was no longer in danger of giving way and people downriver could return home.</p>

<p>Massive flooding was reported in Asheville, in western North Carolina. Governor Ray Cooper called it "one of the worst storms in modern history" to hit his state.</p>

<p>Some residents in South Carolina -- a state that is no stranger to hurricanes -- said Helene was the worst storm to hit in 40 years.</p>

<p>There were reports of remote towns in the Carolina mountains without power or cell service, their roads washed away or buried by mudslides.</p>

<p>In Cedar Key, an island city of 700 people off Florida's Gulf Coast, the full destructive force of the hurricane was on view.</p>

<p>Several pastel-colored wooden homes were destroyed, victims of record storm surges and ferocious winds.</p>

<p>"I've lived here my whole life, and it breaks my heart to see it. We've not really been able to catch a break," said Gabe Doty, a Cedar Key official, referring to two other hurricanes in the past year.</p>

<p><strong>'Gut punch'</strong></p>

<p>In South Carolina, the dead included two firefighters, officials said.</p>

<p>Georgia's 17 deaths included an emergency responder, according to state officials.</p>

<p>Florida Governor Ron DeSantis said the damage from Helene exceeded that of hurricanes Idalia and Debby, which both hit the same region southeast of Tallahassee in the last 13 months.</p>

<p>"It's a real gut punch to those communities," DeSantis told Fox News.</p>

<p>And in the Tennessee town of Erwin, a dramatic rescue operation unfolded, as more than 50 patients and staff trapped on a hospital roof by surging floodwaters had to be rescued by helicopters.</p>

<p>Remnants of the weakened storm dumped water Saturday over the lower midwest.</p>

<p><strong>'Overwhelming' damage</strong></p>

<p>In a statement Saturday, President Joe Biden called Helene's devastation "overwhelming."</p>

<p>Biden was briefed by FEMA administrator Deanne Criswell and Homeland Security Advisor Liz Sherwood-Randall on "the tragic loss of life across the region," the White House said.</p>

<p>"The president directed them to continue to focus on how the Biden-Harris administration can speed support to impacted survivors and accelerate recovery efforts, including the immediate deployment of additional search and rescue teams into North Carolina," it added.</p>

<p>Criswell, who went to Florida on Saturday to survey damage, will visit Georgia on Sunday and North Carolina on Monday to assess the federal response to the storm's impact.</p>

<p>September has been an unusually wet month around the world, with scientists linking some extreme weather events to human-caused global warming.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Low-lying neighbourhoods in Nepal's capital Kathmandu were inundated by surging floodwaters on Sunday after ferocious monsoon rains that police said had killed at least 101 people around the Himalayan republic.</p>

<p>Deadly rain-related floods and landslides are common across South Asia during the monsoon season from June to September, but experts say climate change is increasing their frequency and severity.</p>

<p>Large swathes of eastern and central Nepal have been inundated since Friday with flash floods reported in several rivers and extensive damage to the country's highways.</p>

<p>"The death count has reached 101, and 64 people are missing," police spokesperson Dan Bahadur Karki told AFP.</p>

<p>"There is likely to be an increase in the death count as our search and rescue mission proceeds in the affected areas," he added.</p>

<p>The Kathmandu valley recorded 240 millimetres (9.4 inches) of rain in the 24 hours to Saturday morning, the country's weather bureau told the Kathmandu Post newspaper.</p>

<p>It was the highest rainfall recorded in the capital since at least 1970, the report said.</p>

<p>The Bagmati river and its numerous tributaries which cut through Kathmandu broke their banks, inundating nearby homes and vehicles.</p>

<p>Residents pushed through chest-deep water to get to higher ground, with nearly 3,300 people rescued by relief teams as of Sunday morning.</p>

<p>More than 3,000 security personnel were deployed to assist rescue efforts with helicopters and motorboats.</p>

<p>Rescue teams were using rafts to pull survivors to safety.</p>

<p>Landslides have blocked several highways connecting the capital to the rest of the country, leaving hundreds of travellers stranded.</p>

<p>"We have around eight locations, all of them have been blocked due to landslides in different sections of the road," Kathmandu traffic police officer Bishwaraj Khadka said on Saturday.</p>

<p>Domestic flights have resumed in and out of Kathmandu after weather forced a complete stoppage from Friday evening, with more than 150 departures cancelled.</p>

<p>The summer monsoon brings South Asia 70-80 percent of its annual rainfall.</p>

<p>Monsoon rains from June to September bring widespread death and destruction every year across South Asia, but the number of fatal floods and landslides have increased in recent years.</p>

<p>Experts say climate change has worsened their frequency and intensity.</p>

<p>A landslide that hit a road in Chitwan district in July pushed two buses with 59 passengers aboard into a river.</p>

<p>Three people were able to escape alive, but authorities managed to recover only 20 bodies from the accident, with raging flood waters impeding the search.</p>

<p>More than 260 people have died in Nepal in rain-related disasters this year.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This autumn, Earth will briefly welcome a new visitor. A small asteroid is set to be caught by the planet's gravitational field, becoming a temporary "mini-moon" from September 29 to November 25 before resuming its journey through space.</p>

<p>The mini-moon's arrival has sparked interest among stargazers and space enthusiasts. Unfortunately, it won't be visible to the naked eye due to its small size and lack of brightness. Even binoculars or home telescopes won't reveal it- professional equipment is needed to catch a glimpse.</p>

<p>According to Dr Jennifer Millard, host of the Awesome Astronomy podcast, professional telescopes will capture images of the mini-moon. "You'll be able to see wonderful pictures online of this little dot speeding past the stars," Millard told the BBC.</p>

<h2><strong>Asteroid 2024 PT5</strong></h2>

<p>The asteroid, named 2024 PT5, originates from the Arjuna asteroid belt, which contains rocks with orbits similar to Earth's. It was first detected on August 7 by NASA's Asteroid Terrestrial-Impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) and measures around 33 feet wide.</p>

<p>The asteroid, named 2024 PT5, originates from the Arjuna asteroid belt, which contains rocks with orbits similar to Earth's. It was first detected on August 7 by NASA's Asteroid Terrestrial-Impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) and measures around 33 feet wide.</p>

<p>"It won't complete a full revolution around Earth. Its orbit will be slightly altered by our planet before it continues on its way," Millard explained.</p>

<p>Some asteroids get close to Earth, coming as near as 2.8 million miles (4.5 million km). If an asteroid, like 2024 PT5, moves at a relatively slow speed- around 2,200 mph (3,540 km/h)-Earth's gravity can temporarily trap it, which is exactly what's about to happen this weekend.</p>

<p>Mini-moons have been spotted before, and many more are likely to have gone unnoticed. Some even return for repeat visits, like asteroid 2022 NX1, which became a mini-moon in 1981 and again in 2022.</p>

<p>If you miss this event, don't worry-2024 PT5 is expected to return to Earth's orbit in 2055.</p>

<p>"This story shows just how busy our solar system is and how much remains undiscovered. This asteroid was only detected earlier this year," Millard added.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On Friday, three activists from Just Stop Oil threw soup at two of Vincent van Gogh's "Sunflowers" paintings at London's National Gallery. This incident occurred just hours after two other members of the protest group were sentenced to prison for a similar act in 2022.</p>

<p>The gallery in a statement said "a soup-like substance" had been thrown over "Sunflowers" (1888) and "Sunflowers" (1889) and that three people had been arrested.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Just Stop Oil group (JSO) described their latest action as a "sign of defiance" after two of its members were jailed earlier on Friday for throwing soup at Vincent van Gogh's "Sunflowers" (1888) in October 2022.&nbsp;</p>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p></p>

<p>This incident is part of a broader series of protests by JSO, which advocates for ending the extraction and burning of fossil fuels. These demonstrations have led to increasingly strict responses from authorities, <em>AFP</em> reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In July, Phoebe Plummer, 23, and Anna Holland, 22, were found guilty of criminal damage for pouring tomato soup over the protective screen covering the famous painting. Plummer received a two-year prison sentence on Friday, while Holland was sentenced to 20 months. Both had pleaded not guilty.</p>

<p>Will McCallum, co-executive director of Greenpeace UK, condemned the sentences as "draconian and disproportionate" for what he described as minor damage to the picture frame.</p>

<p>However, Judge Christopher Hehir, who sentenced the activists, argued that the painting could have been "seriously damaged or even destroyed." He criticized the pair for their indifference, stating, "You had no right to do what you did to 'Sunflowers'."</p>

<p>Supporters of Plummer and Holland gathered outside Southwark Crown Court with banners declaring them "political prisoners." The judge dismissed the notion, calling it "ludicrous, offensive and idiotic." He told Plummer, "You think your beliefs entitle you to do anything."</p>

<p>The National Gallery reported that while the protesters caused approximately $13,420 in damage to the frame, the painting itself remained unharmed, protected by a screen. Holland and Plummer had also glued themselves to the gallery wall during the protest.</p>

<p>Plummer had already served 58 days in remand for another protest at London's Heathrow Airport in July. McCallum described the sentencing as "another grim milestone in the ongoing crackdown on peaceful protest," adding that protests are naturally "inconvenient and occasionally messy."</p>

<p>Holland, ahead of her sentencing, said prison would not deter their activism.</p>

<p>JSO identified those involved in Friday's protest as Phil Green, 24, Ludi Simpson, 71, and Mary Patricia Somerville, 77, who confirmed they had thrown soup at the paintings. "We will face the full force of the law," said Simpson, while questioning when fossil fuel executives and politicians would be held accountable for the environmental damage they are causing.</p>

<p>The gallery confirmed that the paintings were examined by a conservator and found to be unharmed, with plans to reopen the exhibition as soon as possible.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Saturday confirmed that he personally authorised the operation to eliminate Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut. The 64-year-old Nasrallah was killed as Israeli strikes targeted dozens of Hezbollah sites in eastern and southern Lebanon following intense rocket fire by the group into northern Israel. Israeli jets bombarded Hezbollah strongholds in southern Beirut overnight, flattening several residential buildings.</p>

<p>Netanyahu termed Nasrallah's death as a critical achievement in Israel's military strategy and as a step toward restoring security along Israel's northern borders.</p>

<p>Addressing his country following Nasrallah's killing, Netanyahu said that Nasrallah had been responsible for orchestrating numerous attacks on Israelis and foreign nationals, including high-profile bombings in the 1980s.&nbsp;</p>

<p>These attacks included the 1983 bombings in Beirut that killed 63 people at the US embassy and hundreds of US Marines and French paratroopers. Netanyahu said that "terrorist" Nasrallah's death was vital for degrading Hezbollah's capabilities, stating, "As long as Nasrallah was alive, he would quickly restore the capabilities we had eroded from Hezbollah."</p>

<p>"We settled the score with the one responsible for the murder of countless Israelis and many citizens of other countries, including hundreds of Americans and dozens of French," he said&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Israeli Prime Minister pointed to the elimination of Nasrallah as a turning point that would accelerate the return of northern Israeli residents who had fled due to cross-border fire and further weaken Hamas, Hezbollah's ally in Gaza. "The more [Hamas leader Yahya] Sinwar sees that Hezbollah is no longer coming to save him, the greater the chances for the return of our hostages," Netanyahu said, referring to the ongoing efforts to secure the release of Israelis captured by Hamas during its October 7 attack.</p>

<p>Netanyahu praised Israel's military and intelligence agencies, including the IDF, Mossad, and Shin Bet, for executing the operation. "We are winning," he said.</p>

<p>Netanyahu used Nasrallah's death as an opportunity to warn Iran. He said that Israel's reach extends across the region, including Iran, and made clear that the killing of Nasrallah should serve as a message to Tehran and its proxies. "There is nowhere in Iran or the Middle East beyond the reach of the long arm of Israel, and today you know how true that is," he said. "I say to the Ayatollah's regime: whoever beat us, we will beat them."</p>

<p>Concluding his message, Netanyahu called this period a "historic turning point" and reaffirmed his commitment to the safe return of displaced residents and the recovery of hostages. He ended with a pledge of unity: "We will fight together, and with God's help, we will win together."</p>

<p>"We are determined to continue to strike at our enemies, return our residents to their homes, and return all our abductees. We do not forget them for a moment," he said.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Princess Diana's hairdresser has weighed in on the controversy surrounding Prince Harry and her riding instructor James Hewitt.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After years of rumours and speculations that Princess Diana's riding instructor James Hewitt, and not King Charles, is the biological father of Prince Harry, a new memoir has shed some light on the nature of their relationship. For years, a few similarities between Hewitt and Harry -- ginger hair and freckles -- led to such rumours.<br />
<br />
Richard Dalton, Diana's hairdresser, has now weighed in on the controversy and even detailed his friendship with the late Princess in a new memoir, “It's All About the Hair”.<br />
<br />
“It's not possible,” Dalton told <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/princess-dianas-friend-devastating-prince-harry-paternity-rumors-not-possible">Fox News Digital</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“It was tough... Harry was already born a while before her relationship with Hewitt. And I don't think it's possible.” To support his statement, Dalton claimed even Princess Diana's brother and sister had "bright red hair".<br />
<br />
“Harry and the Spencer family have red hair. Charles, Diana's brother, had bright red hair when he was (in) college,” he said, adding he used to cut his hair back then.<br />
<br />
He added that Sarah, Diana's sister, also has bright red hair, while her other sister Jane was "more or less the same colouring as Diana."<br />
<br />
In his book, Dalton said that Diana “used to get very upset” over the reports of Hewitt being called Harry's father, adding that the "red hair was a trait from the Spencer family".<br />
<br />
Diana and Hewitt met each other for the first time in 1986, two years after Harry's birth in 1984, according to reports.<br />
<br />
Harry was born “long before Diana even met James Hewitt,” Dalton wrote in his book, adding the two had a "love affair," which lasted three years between 1989 and 1991.&nbsp;Both Harry and Hewitt have addressed the rumour in the past.<br />
<br />
Last year, Harry sued an outlet for apparently using unlawful techniques "on an industrial scale" to score on his life.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
"Numerous newspapers had reported a rumour that my biological father was James Hewitt, a man my mother had a relationship with after I was born," Harry said in a written statement.<br />
<br />
"At the time of this article and others similar to it, I wasn't actually aware that my mother hadn't met Major Hewitt until after I was born," he added.<br />
<br />
In 2002, Hewitt himself addressed the gossip and said, "There really is no possibility whatsoever that I am Harry's father. I can understand the interest, but Harry was already walking by the time my relationship with Diana began."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Democrat Tim Walz and Republican JD Vance will face off next week in the only scheduled US vice presidential debate, a chance for each man to reinforce his running mate's message to voters just weeks before the November 5 election.</p>

<p>Here are some details about the event:</p>

<p><strong>WHEN AND WHERE IS THE DEBATE?</strong></p>

<p>The 90-minute debate, hosted by CBS News, will take place on October 1 at 9 pm ET (0100 GMT on Oct. 2) in New York City, a Democratic stronghold that is the former home of Donald Trump, the Republican presidential candidate running against Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris.</p>

<p><strong>WHO ARE THE MODERATORS?</strong></p>

<p>The debate will take place at the CBS Broadcast Center and be moderated by CBS "Evening News" anchor Norah O'Donnell and "Face the Nation" moderator Margaret Brennan.</p>

<p><strong>HOW CAN YOU WATCH THE DEBATE?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>The event will be broadcast on the CBS network and live streamed on all platforms where CBS News 24/7 and Paramount+ are available. CBS said it will also be made available to simulcast.</p>

<p>The Sept. 10 presidential debate between Harris and Trump on ABC News drew 67 million television viewers.</p>

<p><strong>WHAT ARE THE GROUND RULES?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>There will be no audience. Candidates will stand behind lecterns for the duration of the debate. No props or pre-written notes will be allowed on stage. CBS News reserves the right to turn off candidate microphones.</p>

<p><strong>WHAT TO EXPECT FROM WALZ</strong></p>

<p>Walz, the governor of Minnesota, will likely use his "regular guy" reputation to try to appeal to voters, including some independents, who view Harris, a former senator from California, as too liberal.</p>

<p>The 60-year-old Walz is a former congressman who won elections in a Republican-leaning district before becoming governor.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As governor, he has pushed a progressive agenda including free school meals, tax cuts for the middle class and expanded paid leave for Minnesota workers.</p>

<p>Walz will likely try to needle Vance, as Harris did successfully in her debate with Trump. Walz has questioned Vance's Midwestern credentials and derided his 2016 memoir "Hillbilly Elegy" for its depiction of rural America.</p>

<p>"Like all regular people I grew up with in the heartland, JD studied at Yale, had his career funded by Silicon Valley billionaires and then wrote a bestseller trashing that community," Walz said at his first rally as Harris' vice presidential pick. "Come on! That's not what middle America is."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Walz, also a former high school teacher and football coach, has dismissed Trump and Vance as "creepy and, yes, weird," - a takedown that spread widely among Democrats.</p>

<p>The Democratic vice presidential candidate has linked Vance to a set of conservative policy proposals known as Project 2025, from which Trump has tried to distance himself.</p>

<p><strong>WHAT TO EXPECT FROM VANCE</strong></p>

<p>Vance, a US senator from Ohio, will have to work hard not to be on the defensive throughout the debate if Walz employs Harris' debate strategy.</p>

<p>Vance, 40, likely will face questions about his inflammatory rhetoric and could punch back with his typical combative style.</p>

<p>He has been criticized for referring to Harris and other Democrats in 2021 as a "bunch of childless cat ladies," and more recently, for spreading false claims that Haitian migrants in the Ohio city of Springfield were eating pets.</p>

<p>He has also claimed without evidence that the suspect in the latest assassination attempt against Trump was acting on Democrats' inflammatory language.</p>

<p>"The big difference between conservatives and liberals is that ... no one has tried to kill Kamala Harris in the last couple of months and two people now have tried to kill Donald Trump in the last couple of months," said Vance in comments that drew a rebuke from the White House.</p>

<p>On the campaign trail, Vance has portrayed Walz and Harris as radical liberals.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He also has questioned Walz's depictions of his military record and his family's fertility struggles.</p>

<p>Vance, who served in the Marine Corps and was a public affairs officer during a six-month stint in Iraq, has accused Walz of leaving the Army National Guard to avoid being deployed to Iraq and of falsely suggesting he served in combat.</p>

<p>Walz, who served in the Guard for 24 years, retired to run for Congress. He has defended his record, but the Harris campaign has acknowledged he misspoke in a 2018 video in which he referenced "weapons of war that I carried into war." Walz never served in a combat zone.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

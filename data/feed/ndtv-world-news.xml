       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thousands of Venezuelans marched across the South American country on Saturday over its contested election, as President Nicolas Maduro told supporters some 2,000 people had been arrested during protests against the results.</p>

<p>Venezuela's electoral authority, blasted by critics as favoring the ruling socialists, proclaimed Maduro the winner in last Sunday's vote, saying on Monday he obtained 51% compared to 46% for opposition candidate Edmundo Gonzalez. The authority reaffirmed a similar margin on Friday.</p>

<p>The published election result sparked widespread allegations of fraud and protests. Subsequently security forces cracked down on protests which Maduro's government labeled part of an attempted U.S.-backed coup.</p>

<p>"This time there will be no forgiveness," Maduro told supporters at a rally in Caracas, where he said some 2,000 people had been detained in connection to "crimes" during the protests. He pledged "maximum punishment."</p>

<p>Maduro's supporters said they were defending democracy.</p>

<p>"Today we are here heeding the call of our president ... to defend democracy," Alfredo Valera, president of Venezuela's Fontur union, who took part in a pro-government caravan in Caracas, told state television.</p>

<p>Elsewhere, opposition supporters marched to demand justice, buoyed by the presence of leader Maria Corina Machado, who emerged from hiding on Saturday to join her demonstrations on the streets of Caracas.</p>

<p>"Just as it took us a long time to achieve electoral victory, now comes a stage that we take day by day, but we have never been as strong as today, never," Machado told supporters in Caracas.</p>

<p>Supporters were happy to see Machado in the streets after the leader said in a Thursday op-ed for the Wall Street Journal that she was in hiding and feared for her life.</p>

<p>In addition to Caracas, demonstrations took place in cities including Valencia, Maracaibo and San Cristobal.</p>

<p>"I don't deny it's a little scary to see security forces pass by," said vendor Maria Luzardo, 46, in San Cristobal. "If (Machado) is brave enough to be on the streets despite the threats, so are we. Venezuela is calling us."</p>

<p>So far, at least 20 people have been killed in post-election protests, according to advocacy groups, including U.S.-based Human Rights Watch. Some 1,200 others have been arrested in connection with the demonstrations, according to the government.</p>

<p>During the week, some Venezuelans have appeared outside police stations seeking news of their detained family members.</p>

<p>The Organization of American States urged peace in Venezuela ahead of the planned demonstrations.</p>

<p>"Today we urge that there not be one more political prisoner, nor one more tortured person, nor one more disappeared person, nor one more murdered person," said the OAS, which this week called the election results unreliable.</p>

<p>Nations including the U.S. and Argentina have already recognized Gonzalez as the election's winner, with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Thursday citing "overwhelming evidence." Costa Rica, Ecuador, Panama and Uruguay also concluded on Friday that Gonzalez received the most votes.</p>

<p>Others, including Russia, China and Cuba, have congratulated Maduro.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The killing this week of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, hours after the Israeli assassination of Hezbollah's military chief in Beirut, has triggered vows of vengeance from Iran and the so-called "axis of resistance".]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Middle East tensions soared Saturday as Iran and its allies readied their response to the assassination of Hamas's political leader, blamed on Israel, spurring fears of a regional war.</p>

<p>Israel's ally the United States said it would move warships and fighter jets to the region, while Western governments called on their citizens to leave Lebanon -- where the powerful Iran-backed Hezbollah movement is based -- and airlines cancelled flights.</p>

<p>The killing this week of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, hours after the Israeli assassination of Hezbollah's military chief in Beirut, has triggered vows of vengeance from Iran and the so-called "axis of resistance".</p>

<p>Iran-backed groups from Lebanon, Yemen, Iraq and Syria have already been drawn into the nearly 10-month war between Israel and the Palestinian group Hamas in Gaza.</p>

<p>Israel on Saturday again traded fire with Hezbollah, carried out a deadly raid in the occupied West Bank, and struck a school compound in Gaza City in an attack that the Hamas-ruled territory's civil defence agency said killed at least 17 people.</p>

<p>Numerous schools turned into displacement shelters have been hit across Gaza in recent weeks, with Israel insisting the facilities had been used by militants. Hamas denied using civilian infrastructure for military activities.</p>

<p>Haniyeh was buried on Friday in Qatar, where he had been based. Israel, accused by Hamas, Iran and others of carrying out the attack, has not directly commented on it.</p>

<p>Iran said on Saturday it expects Hezbollah to hit deeper inside Israel and no longer be confined to military targets.</p>

<p>The Pentagon said it was bolstering its military presence in the Middle East to protect US personnel and defend Israel.</p>

<p>It said an aircraft carrier strike group led by the USS Abraham Lincoln would be deployed, as well as additional ballistic missile defence-capable cruisers and destroyers and a new fighter squadron.</p>

<p>US President Joe Biden, at his beach home in Delaware, was asked by reporters if he thought Iran would stand down.</p>

<p>"I hope so," he said. "I don't know."</p>

<p>Soon after, Hezbollah announced it had fired dozens of Katyusha rockets at the northern Israeli settlement of Beit Hillel.</p>

<p>They said it was in response to an Israeli attack on Kfar Kela and Deir Siriane in southern Lebanon which, it said, had injured civilians.</p>

<p>Earlier Saturday, Hezbollah announced the deaths of two of its fighters, including a 17-year-old from Deir Siriane.</p>

<h3><strong>Take 'any ticket available'</strong></h3>

<p>In Beirut, 20-year-old student Diana Abu Aasel told AFP she feared "something bad will happen to my family and friends.</p>

<p>"If there is war, I don't think I will be able to bear staying" in Lebanon, she said.</p>

<p>Crowds of thousands rallied Saturday in Morocco, Jordan and Turkey to denounce Haniyeh's killing and show solidarity with Palestinians, AFP correspondents reported.</p>

<p>Haniyeh's killing is among a series of attacks since April that have heightened fears of a regional conflagration.</p>

<p>His death came hours after Israel struck south Beirut, killing Hezbollah military commander Fuad Shukr.</p>

<p>Both Britain and the United States on Satuday urged their citizens in Lebanon to leave immediately.</p>

<p>Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas in retaliation for its unprecedented October 7 attack which triggered war in Gaza and resulted in the deaths of 1,197 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures.</p>

<p>Militants also seized 251 hostages, 111 of whom are still held captive in Gaza, including 39 the military says are dead.</p>

<p>Israel's campaign against Hamas has killed at least 39,550 people in Gaza, according to the territory's health ministry, which does not give details of civilian and militant deaths.</p>

<p>Haniyeh was Hamas's lead negotiator in efforts to end the war. His killing raised questions about the continued viability of efforts by Qatari, Egyptian and US mediators to broker a truce and exchange of hostages and prisoners.</p>

<p>Hamas officials but also some analysts and protesters in Israel have accused Netanyahu of prolonging the war to safeguard his ruling hard-right coalition.</p>

<p>Protesters in several Israeli cities Saturday renewed their calls for a hostage-release deal.</p>

<h3><strong>Disease spreading in Gaza</strong></h3>

<p>US Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke separately with his French and British counterparts on Saturday about the situation in the Middle East, State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said.</p>

<p>Blinken, UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy and French Foreign Minister Stephane Sejourne all agreed on the need for restraint on all sides in the region, Miller said in a statement.</p>

<p>Violence has also surged in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Palestinian official sources said two Israeli air strikes killed nine people in the north of the territory Saturday.</p>

<p>The military said it had "eliminated terrorist cells".</p>

<p>The war in Gaza has caused widespread destruction and displaced almost the entire population of the territory where, the UN said on Friday, public health conditions "continue to deteriorate".</p>

<p>It said nearly 40,000 cases of Hepatitis A, spread by contaminated food and water, have been reported since the war began.</p>

<p>Hezbollah has been exchanging near-daily cross-border fire with Israeli forces since October, saying it is acting in support of Hamas.</p>

<p>Several airlines have suspended flights to Beirut and Tel Aviv.</p>

<p>Flights to Beirut by Air France and low-cost carrier Transavia France will remain halted until at least Tuesday, their parent company said Saturday.</p>

<p>Turkish Airlines on Saturday cancelled its night-time flights to Tehran for the second night running, AFP correspondents noted.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Regional tensions have soared following the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh, Hamas' top leader, on Wednesday, a day after an Israeli strike in Beirut killed Fuad Shukr, a senior Hezbollah military commander.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden expressed hope Iran would stand down despite its threat to avenge the assassination of Hamas' leader in Tehran, as fears mounted that Israel's war against Palestinian militants in Gaza could escalate into a wider Middle East conflict.</p>

<p>Regional tensions have soared following the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh, Hamas' top leader, on Wednesday, a day after an Israeli strike in Beirut killed Fuad Shukr, a senior military commander from the Lebanese group Hezbollah, which like Hamas is backed by Iran.</p>

<p>Iran and Hamas have blamed Israel for Haniyeh's killing, and they, together with Hezbollah, have vowed revenge. Israel has not claimed or denied responsibility.</p>

<p>Asked by reporters whether Iran would stand down, Biden said on Saturday in response to a shouted question, "I hope so. I don't know."</p>

<p>Seeking to bolster defenses in the Middle East in response to threats from Israel's foes, the Pentagon said on Friday it would deploy additional fighter jets and Navy warships to the region.</p>

<p>Haniyeh's death was one in a series of killings of senior Hamas figures as the Gaza war nears its 11th month, and it fuelled concern that the conflict in Gaza was turning into a wider Middle East war.</p>

<p>Hamas said it had begun a "broad consultation process" to choose a new leader three days after the assassination of Haniyeh, who was the face of the group's international diplomacy.</p>

<p>The US and international partners including France, Britain, Italy and Egypt continued diplomatic contacts on Saturday seeking to prevent further regional escalation.</p>

<p>The US urged its citizens who wish to leave Lebanon to start making plans immediately, and the British government advised its nationals to "leave now." Canada warned citizens to avoid all travel to Israel, saying the regional armed conflict endangered security.</p>

<h3><strong>VIOLENCE IN GAZA AND WEST BANK</strong></h3>

<p>Violence continued on Saturday in the Palestinian territories.</p>

<p>An Israeli airstrike on a school sheltering displaced persons in Gaza City killed at least 15 Palestinians on Saturday, hours after two strikes in the occupied West Bank killed nine militants including a local Hamas commander, Hamas said.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said the first of two West Bank airstrikes hit a vehicle in a town near the city of Tulkarm, targeting a militant cell it said was on its way to carry out an attack.</p>

<p>A Hamas statement said one of those killed was a commander of its Tulkarm brigades, while its ally Islamic Jihad claimed the other four men who died in the strike as its fighters.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hours later, a second airstrike in the area targeted another group of militants who had fired on troops, Israel's military said, during what it described as a counterterrorism operation in Tulkarm.</p>

<p>Palestinian news agency WAFA said four people had died in that strike, and Hamas said all nine of those killed in the two Israeli attacks in the West Bank were fighters.</p>

<p>At least 39,550 Palestinians have been killed in the Israeli military campaign in Gaza, according to Gaza health officials. The offensive was triggered by a Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7 in which 1,200 people were killed and 250 abducted, according to Israeli tallies.</p>

<p>A high-level Israeli delegation made a brief visit to Cairo on Saturday in an attempt to resume Gaza ceasefire negotiations, Egyptian airport authority sources said. The Israeli officials returned to Israel hours later, Israeli media said.</p>

<p>Chances of a breakthrough appear low following the latest incidents in Lebanon and Iran.</p>

<p>Israel has not said whether or not it was behind Haniyeh's assassination. But Netanyahu said earlier this week that Israel had delivered crushing blows to Iran's proxies of late, including Hamas and Hezbollah.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Vatican said on Saturday it had been saddened by a skit at the Paris Olympics opening ceremony appearing to parody Leonardo da Vinci's "The Last Supper" painting.</p>

<p>"The Holy See was saddened by certain scenes at the opening ceremony of the Paris Olympic Games and cannot but join the voices raised in recent days to deplore the offence done to many Christians and believers of other religions," it said in an unusual weekend evening press release issued in French.</p>

<p>The segment in the July 26 ceremony resembled the biblical scene of Jesus Christ and his apostles sharing a last meal before crucifixion, but featured drag queens, a transgender model and a naked singer as the Greek god of wine Dionysus.</p>

<p>Paris 2024 organizers apologised two days later, saying there was never an intention to disrespect any religious group.</p>

<p>The artistic director behind the scene said it had not been inspired by the Christian last supper, but rather a pagan feast linked to the historical Olympics.</p>

<p>"In a prestigious event where the whole world comes together around common values, there should not be allusions ridiculing the religious convictions of many people," the Vatican added.</p>

<p>"Freedom of expression, which is obviously not called into question, finds its limit in respect for others."</p>

<p>The Vatican did not say why it was issuing its statement more than a week after the opening ceremony.</p>

<p>Pope Francis had a phone call on Aug. 1 with Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, at which Erdogan said the two leaders had discussed the Paris event.</p>

<p>Although the Vatican later confirmed to Reuters that the call took place, it would not comment on what the leaders discussed.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Renewed street violence in British cities on Saturday left several police officers injured as they faced a fourth day of unrest following the murder of three young girls in northwest England earlier in the week.</p>

<p>Riots involving hundreds of anti-immigration protesters have erupted in several towns and cities in recent days after false information spread rapidly on social media that the suspect in Monday's knife attack at a dance class for children in Southport was a radical Muslim migrant.</p>

<p>Police have said the suspect, Axel Rudakubana, 17, was born in Cardiff, Wales, but protests by anti-immigration and anti-Muslim demonstrators have continued, descending into violence and rioting, most recently in the northeastern city of Sunderland on Friday evening.</p>

<p>Police in Liverpool said on Saturday that a number of officers had been injured while dealing with "serious disorder" in the city centre.</p>

<p>Authorities in the eastern city of Hull said four people were arrested and three officers were injured while dealing with protests where bottles were thrown.</p>

<p>Mosques across the country have been advised to strengthen security, while police have deployed extra officers.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer, facing his first big test since being elected a month ago, has condemned the "far-right" for the violence and backed police to take strong action. He discussed the disorder with senior ministers on Saturday, his office said.</p>

<p>The last time major widespread violence erupted in Britain was in 2011 when thousands took to the streets for five nights after police shot dead a Black man in London.</p>

<p>Reuters witnesses in Liverpool, Leeds, Manchester and Belfast reported a tense atmosphere on Saturday afternoon as police tried to keep several hundred rival protesters who were chanting slogans from clashing.</p>

<p>Scuffles and violence broke out in some cities, including in Liverpool, where eggs, beer cans and smoke grenades were thrown, while in Belfast, some businesses reported damage to property.</p>

<p>"I have no reason why they attacked us," said Rahmi Akyol, standing outside his cafe in Belfast, whose glass doors were shattered after being attacked by dozens of people throwing bottles and chairs.</p>

<p>"I've lived here 35 years. My kids, my wife is from here. I don't know what to say, it's terrible," he said.</p>

<p>At protests in London, police arrested several people including one for making a Nazi salute towards a counter-protester.</p>

<p>On Friday night hundred of anti-immigration demonstrators in Sunderland threw stones at police in riot gear near a mosque, before overturning vehicles, setting a car alight and starting a fire near a police station.</p>

<p>Four injured police officers were taken to hospital and 12 people were arrested, Mark Hall, chief police superintendent of the Sunderland area, told reporters on Saturday.</p>

<p>"This was not a protest. This was unforgivable violence and disorder," Hall said.</p>

<p>At least 30 demonstrations were being planned across the UK this weekend, the BBC said, along with a number of counter-protests by anti-racism groups.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a press release)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kamala Harris's campaign branded Donald Trump "scared" Saturday after he proposed to change the presidential debate schedule ahead of a rally in Georgia where he will try to halt the vice president's surging momentum in her bid to become America's first woman president.</p>

<p>In an overnight post on his Truth Social app, Trump said he was willing to debate Harris on the conservative Fox News network on September 4, while declining to participate in a previously scheduled debate on ABC.</p>

<p>Trump pitched the idea before going to a rally in Atlanta, where he will gather supporters in the same arena where Harris addressed an excited crowd of some 10,000 just this Tuesday.</p>

<p>Trump said he had "agreed" to the debate plan with Fox. And he said it would take place in Pennsylvania -- a crucial swing state in the US presidential electoral system -- in front of a live audience.</p>

<p>The Harris campaign dismissed this as "games."</p>

<p>"Donald Trump is running scared and trying to back out of the debate he already agreed to and running straight to Fox News to bail him out," Harris's campaign communications director Michael Tyler said in a statement. "He needs to... show up to the debate he already committed to on Sept 10."</p>

<p>The proposal to confront Harris on a network that has long supported him was the latest Trump effort to recapture the initiative in a campaign that had been entirely focused on a rematch against 81-year-old Joe Biden, until he dramatically dropped his reelection bid on July 21.</p>

<p>Since then, Harris, 59, has reenergized the Democratic base almost overnight.</p>

<p>She has raked in donations, reassembled the team behind Barack Obama's two historic election victories, and neutralized the solid lead that 78-year-old Trump had built against Biden in opinion polls.</p>

<p>On Friday, she secured the official Democratic nomination, backed by near unanimous party support.</p>

<p>Harris is due imminently to announce her vice presidential pick, with the popular governor of key state Pennsylvania, Josh Shapiro, a frontrunner. On Tuesday, she is set to launch a countrywide tour with her yet-to-be-named running mate.</p>

<p>Rally in battleground state</p>

<p>Late Saturday, Trump will be joined by his own vice presidential pick, Senator J.D. Vance, at the rally in Georgia -- another battleground state that will help decide who wins the Electoral College majority on November 5.</p>

<p>Trump lost narrowly to Biden there in 2020 and the state was at the center of his unprecedented attempts to overturn the results of the election and refusal to accept defeat.</p>

<p>The size of Harris's rally on Tuesday was a warning sign to the Trump campaign, which has long touted its ability to draw thousands of passionate supporters, in contrast to Biden's usually meager crowds.</p>

<p>The situation is a remarkable turnaround in a campaign where Trump had been appearing to gather force while Biden -- hurt by a disastrous debate performance in June and mounting voter concerns over his mental acuity -- was steadily slipping.</p>

<p>Harris's rapid entry has left the Trump campaign scrambling -- and Trump now the oldest presidential nominee in US history.</p>

<p>Adding to the changed dynamics, Harris is vying to become the first woman president and the first of Black and Indian biracial heritage.</p>

<p>Trump drew gasps at a convention of Black journalists this week when he claimed that Harris, who has identified closely with her Black roots all her life, was only pretending.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<ol>
	<li>India has asked its nationals to avoid all non-essential travel to Lebanon. "All Indian nationals in Lebanon are advised to exercise caution, restrict their movements and remain in contact with embassy of India in Beirut," the embassy said.</li>
	<li>"Tensions are high, and the situation could deteriorate rapidly," Britain's Foreign Minister David Lammy said in a statement. "While we are working round the clock to strengthen our consular presence in Lebanon, my message to British nationals there is clear -- leave now."</li>
	<li>France has also asked its nationals visiting Iran to leave immediately. "Due to the increased risk of a military escalation in the region, visiting French nationals still in Iran are invited to leave as soon as possible," the foreign ministry said.</li>
	<li>The US embassy in Lebanon has asked its citizens to leave Lebanon on "any ticket available". Despite flight cancellations, "commercial transportation options to leave Lebanon remain available", the US embassy said. "We encourage those who wish to depart Lebanon to book any ticket available to them, even if that flight does not depart immediately or does not follow their first-choice route," it said.</li>
	<li>Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel was prepared for any "aggression" against it following threats of retaliation for the killings of the top Hamas and Hezbollah figures.</li>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bangladeshi student leaders on Saturday said they would carry on a planned nationwide civil disobedience campaign until Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina resigned following last month's deadly police crackdown on protesters.</p>

<p>Rallies against civil service job quotas sparked days of mayhem in July that killed more than 200 people in some of the worst unrest of Hasina's 15-year tenure.</p>

<p>Troop deployments briefly restored order but crowds returned to the streets in huge numbers this week ahead of an all-out non-cooperation movement aimed at paralysing the government planned to begin on Sunday.</p>

<p>Students Against Discrimination, the group responsible for organising the initial protests, rebuffed an offer of talks with Hasina earlier in the day before announcing their campaign would continue until the premier and her government step down.</p>

<p>"She must resign and she must face trial," Nahid Islam, the group's leader, told a crowd of thousands at a monument to national heroes in the capital Dhaka to roars of approval.</p>

<p>Students Against Discrimination have asked their compatriots to cease paying taxes and utility bills from Sunday to pile pressure on the government.</p>

<p>They have also asked government workers and labourers in the country's economically vital garment factories to strike.</p>

<p>"She must go because we don't need this authoritarian government," Nijhum Yasmin, 20, told AFP from one of many protests staged around Dhaka on Saturday.</p>

<p>"Did we liberate the country to see our brothers and sisters shot dead by this regime?"</p>

<p>The looming non-cooperation campaign deliberately evokes a historical civil disobedience campaign during Bangladesh's 1971 liberation war against Pakistan.</p>

<p>That earlier movement was spearheaded by Hasina's father Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the country's independence leader, and is remembered by Bangladeshis as a part of a proud battle against tyranny.</p>

<p>"Now the tables have turned," Illinois State University politics professor Ali Riaz told AFP.</p>

<p>"The regime's foundation has been shaken, the aura of invincibility has disappeared," he added. "The question is whether Hasina is ready to look for an exit or fight to the last."</p>

<p>32 children killed</p>

<p>Hasina, 76, has ruled Bangladesh since 2009 and won her fourth consecutive election in January after a vote without genuine opposition.</p>

<p>Her government is accused by rights groups of misusing state institutions to entrench its hold on power and stamp out dissent, including the extrajudicial killing of opposition activists.</p>

<p>Demonstrations began in early July over the reintroduction of a quota scheme -- since scaled back by Bangladesh's top court -- that reserved more than half of all government jobs for certain groups.</p>

<p>With around 18 million young Bangladeshis out of work, according to government figures, the move upset graduates facing an acute employment crisis.</p>

<p>The protests had remained largely peaceful until attacks on demonstrators by police and pro-government student groups.</p>

<p>Hasina's government eventually imposed a nationwide curfew, deployed troops and shut down the nation's mobile internet network for 11 days to restore order.</p>

<p>But the clampdown provoked a torrent of criticism from abroad and failed to quell widespread rancour at home.</p>

<p>Crowds returned to the streets in huge numbers after Friday prayers in the Muslim-majority nation, heeding a call by student leaders to press the government for more concessions.</p>

<p>European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell this week called for an international probe into the "excessive and lethal force against protesters".</p>

<p>Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan told reporters last weekend that security forces had operated with restraint but were "forced to open fire" to defend government buildings.</p>

<p>At least 32 children were among those killed last month, the United Nations said Friday.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[An Israeli airstrike on a school sheltering displaced persons in Gaza City killed at least 15 Palestinians on Saturday, hours after two strikes in the occupied West Bank killed nine militants including a local Hamas commander, Hamas said.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An Israeli airstrike on a school sheltering displaced persons in Gaza City killed at least 15 Palestinians on Saturday, hours after two strikes in the occupied West Bank killed nine militants including a local Hamas commander, Hamas said.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said the first of two West Bank airstrikes hit a vehicle in a town near the city of Tulkarm, targeting a militant cell it said was on its way to carry out an attack.</p>

<p>A Hamas statement said one of those killed was a commander of its Tulkarm brigades, while its ally Islamic Jihad claimed the other four men who died in the strike as its fighters.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hours later, a second airstrike in the area targeted another group of militants who had fired on troops, Israel's military said, during what it described as a counterterrorism operation in Tulkarm.</p>

<p>Palestinian news agency WAFA said four people had died in that strike, and Hamas said all nine of those killed in the two Israeli attacks in the West Bank were fighters.</p>

<p>Violence in the West Bank was on the rise before the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza and has risen since, with frequent Israeli raids in the territory, which is among those that the Palestinians seek for a state.</p>

<p>There has also been an increase in anti-Israeli street attacks by Palestinians.</p>

<p>The latest strikes in the Palestinian territories came amid Israel's growing tensions with Iran and Lebanon's Hezbollah group that have fanned fears of a widened conflict in the Middle East.</p>

<p>The U.S. and international partners including France, Britain, Italy and Egypt, continued diplomatic contacts on Saturday seeking to prevent further regional escalation.</p>

<p>Hamas said it had begun a "broad consultation process" to choose a new leader three days after the assassination in Tehran of Ismail Haniyeh, who was the face of the group's international diplomacy. Iran and Hamas have blamed Israel and vowed to retaliate. Israel has not claimed or denied responsibility.</p>

<h3><strong>GAZA STRIKES</strong></h3>

<p>In the Gaza Strip, at least 15 people were killed in the Israeli strike on a school sheltering displaced persons in Gaza City's Sheikh Radwan neighbourhood, the Hamas run-government media office said.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said the school was being used as a command centre for Hamas, to hide militants and manufacture weapons. Hamas has denied Israeli accusations that it operates from civilian facilities such as schools and hospitals.</p>

<p>Earlier on Saturday, Israeli strikes in the enclave killed six people in a house in the southern area of Rafah and two others in Gaza City, Gaza health officials said.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said its forces had struck militants and destroyed Hamas infrastructure in Rafah and elsewhere in the enclave.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At least 39,550 Palestinians have been killed in the Israeli military campaign in Gaza, according to Gaza health officials. The offensive was triggered by a Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7 in which 1,200 people were killed and 250 abducted, according to Israeli tallies.</p>

<p>A high-level Israeli delegation made a brief visit to Cairo on Saturday in an attempt to resume Gaza ceasefire negotiations, Egyptian airport authority sources said. The Israeli officials returned to Israel hours later, Israeli media said.</p>

<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office accused Hamas of trying to add changes to the "outline" of a potential agreement, referring to a proposal U.S. President Joe Biden laid out in May. Hamas has blamed Netanyahu, saying he does not want to stop the war.</p>

<p>Chances of a breakthrough appear low as regional tension has soared following the assassination of Haniyeh, Hamas's top leader, on Wednesday, a day after an Israeli strike in Beirut killed Fuad Shukr, a senior military commander from Hezbollah, which like Hamas is backed by Iran.</p>

<p>Haniyeh's death was one in a series of killings of senior Hamas figures as the Gaza war nears its 11th month, and it fuelled concern that the conflict in Gaza was turning into a wider Middle East war.</p>

<p>Israel has not said whether or not it was behind Haniyeh's assassination. But Netanyahu said earlier this week that Israel had delivered crushing blows to Iran's proxies of late, including Hamas and Hezbollah.</p>

<p>U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke separately to French Foreign Minister Stephane Sejourne and British Foreign Secretary David Lammy on Saturday on the need to reach a ceasefire and hostage release deal in Gaza and to prevent the conflict from spreading, the State Department said.</p>

<p>Egypt's foreign minister, Badr Abdelatty, stressed in a phone call with Iran's acting foreign minister, Ali Bagheri Kani, that recent developments in the region were "unprecedented, very dangerous" and threatening to stability, Egypt's government said.</p>

<p>In addition, the Italian Foreign Ministry said: "Italy makes an appeal to Iran, calling on it for restraint and to contribute to a phase of de-escalation throughout the Mediterranean region and the Middle East." It added that the message had been delivered to the Iranian ambassador in Rome.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Iran said it expects Lebanon's Tehran-backed Hezbollah group to hit deeper inside Israel and no longer be confined to military targets after Israel killed the Hezbollah commander. Hezbollah has been exchanging near-daily fire with Israeli forces.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<ol>
	<li>A strike claimed by Israel in an overcrowded residential area of South Beirut has changed the calculus, Iran's mission to the United Nations said. "We expect... Hezbollah to choose more targets and (strike) deeper in its response," said the mission quoted by the official IRNA news agency. "Secondly, that it will not limit its response to military targets."&nbsp;</li>
	<li>The strike on Tuesday killed Hezbollah commander Fuad Shukr. According to Lebanon's health ministry, five civilians -- three women and two children -- also died.</li>
	<li>Israel said Shukr was responsible for rocket fire that killed 12 youth in the annexed Golan Heights, and had directed Hezbollah's attacks on Israel since the Gaza war began.</li>
	<li>"Hezbollah and the (Israeli) regime had observed certain lines", including limiting strikes to border areas and military targets, Iran's mission said. The Beirut strike crossed that line, it added.</li>
	<li>Hours after Shukr's killing, the political leader of Hamas, Ismail Haniyeh, was killed in a pre-dawn "hit" on his accommodation in Tehran, Iran's Revolutionary Guards said. Israel has declined to comment.</li>
	<li>The US will bolster its military presence in the Middle East, deploying additional warships and fighter jets to the region to "mitigate the possibility of regional escalation by Iran" or its proxies, the Pentagon said.</li>
	<li>Indian nationals in Israel have been asked to stay vigilant and adhere to the safety protocols following the escalating tension in the region. The advisory for Indian citizens in Israel comes a day after the Indian Embassy in Beirut strongly advised them against travelling to Lebanon till further notice. It also asked them to leave Lebanon.</li>
	<li>The leader of Yemen's Iran-backed Huthi rebels also vowed a "military response" to the killing of Ismail. "There has to be a military response to these crimes, which are shameless and dangerous, and constitute a major escalation by the Israeli enemy," Abdul Malik al-Huthi said in a televised speech.</li>
	<li>The Yemeni rebels have been launching drones and missiles at shipping in the Red Sea since November, saying they are acting in solidarity with Palestinians during the Gaza war.</li>
	<li>Fighting between Israel and Hezbollah since October last year has killed at least 542 people on the Lebanese side, most of them fighters but also including 114 civilians, according to a tally by news agency AFP.</li>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iran's Revolutionary Guards said on Saturday that Palestinian militant group Hamas' leader Ismail Haniyeh was slain in Tehran by a short-range projectile with a warhead of about 7 kg, and vowed severe revenge.</p>

<p>Wednesday's assassination has drawn fears of direct conflict between Tehran and its arch-enemy Israel in a region shaken by Israel's war in Gaza and a worsening conflict in Lebanon.</p>

<p>Revenge for the killing of the Hamas leader will be "severe and at an appropriate time, place, and manner," the Guards' statement added, blaming the "terrorist Zionist regime" of Israel for his death.</p>

<p>Iran and Hamas have accused Israel of carrying out the strike that killed Haniyeh hours after he attended the inauguration of Iran's new president.</p>

<p>Israeli officials have not claimed responsibility.</p>

<p>The statement by the elite Guards force also accused the "criminal U.S. government" of supporting the attack which Iranian media said was in a northern suburb of Tehran.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Flights to Beirut by Air France and low-cost carrier Transavia France will remain suspended until at least Tuesday due to "security" concerns in the region, parent company Air France-KLM said.</p>

<p>The two French airlines first stopped servicing the route on Monday, a day after Israel vowed to retaliate following rocket fire from Lebanon that killed 12 people in the Israeli-annexed Golan Heights.</p>

<p>"Any resumption of operation will be subject to a renewed evaluation on the ground," a spokesman said Saturday, adding that passengers with reservations could rebook at no extra cost.</p>

<p>Flights to Tel Aviv will continue as normal, he added.</p>

<p>The rocket attack on the Golan Heights sparked fears that fighting between Hezbollah and Israel would escalate.</p>

<p>When those fears subsided somewhat the airlines announced on Tuesday that flights would resume on Wednesday.</p>

<p>But Israel then struck a Hezbollah stronghold in south Beirut on Tuesday evening, targeting a senior commander it blamed for the rocket strike on the Golan Heights.</p>

<p>This development sparked an extension of the flight suspension until Saturday, which has now been prolonged again.</p>

<p>Iran said on earlier Saturday it expects the Tehran-backed Hezbollah group to hit deeper inside Israel and no longer be confined to military targets.</p>

<p>Hezbollah has been exchanging near-daily fire with Israeli forces.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Prompted by Reuters to make "an Americana song in the style of Tift Merritt," the artificial intelligence music website Udio instantly generated "Holy Grounds," a ballad with lyrics about "driving old backroads".]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Country musician Tift Merritt's most popular song on Spotify, "Traveling Alone," is a ballad with lyrics evoking solitude and the open road. Prompted by Reuters to make "an Americana song in the style of Tift Merritt," the artificial intelligence music website Udio instantly generated "Holy Grounds," a ballad with lyrics about "driving old backroads" while "watching the fields and skies shift and sway."</p>

<p>Merritt, a Grammy-nominated singer and songwriter, told Reuters that the "imitation" Udio created "doesn't make the cut for any album of mine." "This is a great demonstration of the extent to which this technology is not transformative at all," Merritt said.</p>

<p>"It's stealing." Merritt, who is a longtime artists' rights advocate, isn't the only musician sounding alarms. In April, she joined Billie Eilish, Nicki Minaj, Stevie Wonder and dozens of other artists in an open letter warning that AI-generated music trained on their recordings could "sabotage creativity" and sideline human artists.</p>

<p>The big record labels are worried too. Sony Music, Universal Music Group and Warner Music sued Udio and another music AI company called Suno in June, marking the music industry's entrance into high-stakes copyright battles over AI-generated content that are just starting to make their way through the courts. "Ingesting massive amounts of creative labor to imitate it is not creative," said Merritt, an independent musician whose first record label is now owned by UMG, but who said she is not financially involved with the company. "That's stealing in order to be competition and replace us."</p>

<p>Suno and Udio pointed to past public statements defending their technology when asked for comment for this story. They filed their initial responses in court on Thursday, denying any copyright violations and arguing that the lawsuits were attempts to stifle smaller competitors. They compared the labels' protests to past industry concerns about synthesizers, drum machines and other innovations replacing human musicians.</p>

<p>UNCHARTED GROUND</p>

<p>The companies, which have both attracted venture capital funding, have said they bar users from creating songs explicitly mimicking top artists. But the new lawsuits say Suno and Udio can be prompted to reproduce elements of songs by Mariah Carey, James Brown and others and to mimic voices of artists like ABBA and Bruce Springsteen, showing that they misused the labels' catalog of copyrighted recordings to train their systems.</p>

<p>Mitch Glazier, CEO of the music industry trade group the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), said that the lawsuits "document shameless copying of troves of recordings in order to flood the market with cheap imitations and drain away listens and income from real human artists and songwriters." "AI has great promise - but only if it's built on a sound, responsible, licensed footing," Glazier said.</p>

<p>Asked for comment on the cases, Warner Music referred Reuters to the RIAA. Sony and UMG did not respond.</p>

<p>The labels' claims echo allegations by novelists, news outlets, music publishers and others in high-profile copyright lawsuits over chatbots like OpenAI's ChatGPT and Anthropic's Claude that use generative AI to create text. Those lawsuits are still pending and in their early stages.</p>

<p>Both sets of cases pose novel questions for the courts, including whether the law should make exceptions for AI's use of copyrighted material to create something new. The record labels' cases, which could take years to play out, also raise questions unique to their subject matter - music. The interplay of melody, harmony, rhythm and other elements can make it harder to determine when parts of a copyrighted song have been infringed compared to works like written text, said Brian McBrearty, a musicologist who specializes in copyright analysis.</p>

<p>"Music has more factors than just the stream of words," McBrearty said. "It has pitch, and it has rhythm, and it has harmonic context. It's a richer mix of different elements that make it a little bit less straightforward." Some claims in the AI copyright cases could hinge on comparisons between an AI system's output and the material allegedly misused to train it, requiring the kind of analysis that has challenged judges and juries in cases about music. In a 2018 decision that a dissenting judge called "a dangerous precedent," Robin Thicke and Pharrell Williams lost a case brought by Marvin Gaye's estate over the resemblance of their hit "Blurred Lines" to Gaye's "Got to Give It Up." But artists including Katy Perry and Ed Sheeran have since fended off similar complaints over their own songs.</p>

<p>Suno and Udio argued in very similar court filings that their outputs do not infringe copyrights and said US copyright law protects sound recordings that "imitate or simulate" other recorded music."Music copyright has always been a messy universe," said Julie Albert, an intellectual property partner at law firm Baker Botts in New York who is tracking the new cases. And even without that complication, Albert said fast-evolving AI technology is creating new uncertainty at every level of copyright law.</p>

<p>WHOSE FAIR USE?</p>

<p>The intricacies of music may matter less in the end if, as many expect, the AI cases boil down to a "fair use" defense against infringement claims - another area of US copyright law filled with open questions. Fair use promotes freedom of expression by allowing the unauthorized use of copyright-protected works under certain circumstances, with courts often focusing on whether the new use transforms the original works. Defendants in AI copyright cases have argued that their products make fair use of human creations, and that any court ruling to the contrary would be disastrous for the potentially multi-trillion-dollar AI industry.</p>

<p>Suno and Udio said in their answers to the labels' lawsuits on Thursday that their use of existing recordings to help people create new songs "is a quintessential 'fair use.'</p>

<p>"Fair use could make or break the cases, legal experts said, but no court has yet ruled on the issue in the AI context. Albert said that music-generating AI companies could have a harder time proving fair use compared to chatbot makers, which can summarize and synthesize text in ways that courts may be more likely to consider transformative. Imagine a student using AI to generate a report about the U.S. Civil War that incorporates text from a novel on the subject, she said, compared to someone asking AI to create new music based on existing music.</p>

<p>The student example "certainly feels like a different purpose than logging onto a music-generating tool and saying 'hey, I'd like to make a song that sounds like a top 10 artist,'" Albert said. "The purpose is pretty similar to what the artist would have had in the first place."</p>

<p>A Supreme Court ruling on fair use last year could have an outsized impact on music cases because it focused largely on whether a new use has the same commercial purpose as the original work. This argument is a key part of the Suno and Udio complaints, which said that the companies use the labels' music "for the ultimate purpose of poaching the listeners, fans, and potential licensees of the sound recordings [they] copied."</p>

<p>Merritt said she worries technology companies could try to use AI to replace artists like her. If musicians' songs can be extracted for free and used to imitate them, she said, the economics are straightforward. "Robots and AI do not get royalties," she said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iran said on Saturday it expects Lebanon's Tehran-backed Hezbollah group to hit deeper inside Israel and no longer be confined to military targets after Israel killed the Hezbollah military commander.</p>

<p>Hezbollah has been exchanging near-daily fire with Israeli forces, saying it is targeting military positions over the border, since its Palestinian ally Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, sparking war in Gaza.</p>

<p>But a strike claimed by Israel in an overcrowded residential area of South Beirut changed the calculus, Iran's mission to the United Nations said.</p>

<p>"We expect... Hezbollah to choose more targets and (strike) deeper in its response," said the mission quoted by the official IRNA news agency.</p>

<p>"Secondly, that it will not limit its response to military targets."</p>

<p>The strike on Tuesday killed Hezbollah commander Fuad Shukr. According to Lebanon's health ministry, five civilians -- three women and two children -- also died.</p>

<p>Israel said Shukr was responsible for rocket fire that killed 12 youths in the annexed Golan Heights, and had directed Hezbollah's attacks on Israel since the Gaza war began.</p>

<p>"Hezbollah and the (Israeli) regime had observed certain lines", including limiting strikes to border areas and military targets, Iran's mission said.</p>

<p>The Beirut strike crossed that line, it added.</p>

<p>Hours after Shukr's killing, the political leader of Hamas, Ismail Haniyeh, was killed in a pre-dawn "hit" on his accommodation in Tehran, Iran's Revolutionary Guards said.</p>

<p>Israel has declined to comment.</p>

<p>On Thursday, Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah said Israel and "those who are behind it must await our inevitable response" to the killings of both Shukr and Haniyeh.</p>

<p>Iran and Hamas have also vowed to retaliate.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Palestinian militant group Hamas is preparing to choose a political leader after the killing of Ismail Haniyeh in a Wednesday attack in Tehran blamed on Israel.</p>

<p>Speculation is swirling over the crucial succession almost 10 months into the Gaza war which erupted following Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel.</p>

<p>Qatar-based Haniyeh, elected Hamas's political chief in 2017, died in a pre-dawn strike on his accommodation while he was visiting the Iranian capital for the swearing-in ceremony of President Masoud Pezeshkian.</p>

<p>The context of this succession -- a violent death amid a months-long war in Gaza -- may influence the future of Hamas more than the individual personality of its leader.</p>

<p>Despite the emergence of pragmatists moving toward indirect recognition of Israel's right to exist, Hamas members remain committed to an uncompromising approach to the struggle for a Palestinian state, including through armed means.</p>

<p>A source from the group told AFP that "relations with Arab and Islamic countries" will also be taken into account in picking its next leader.</p>

<p>Here are some of the senior officials tipped as Hamas's next potential political leader:</p>

<h3><strong>Khalil al-Hayya</strong></h3>

<p>Khalil al-Hayya is the deputy head of Hamas's political bureau in the Gaza Strip, and said to be well acquainted with the group's leader in the territory Yahya Sinwar.</p>

<p>In 2006 Hayya headed Hamas's parliamentary bloc, which had just won elections. The subsequent months of political and administrative discord marked the beginning of the schism between the Islamist movement and Fatah, the party of Palestinian Authority President Mahmud Abbas.</p>

<p>Hayya, who has repeatedly stressed the importance of armed struggle, lost several family members in Israeli military operations including one that targeted his house in the northern Gaza Strip in 2007.</p>

<h3><strong>Musa Abu Marzuk</strong></h3>

<p>The senior member of Hamas's political bureau is considered similar to Haniyeh in his pragmatic approach to negotiations.</p>

<p>For instance, Marzuk has spoken out in favour of a "long-term ceasefire" with Israel, and favours accepting the Palestinian borders drawn after the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, which remains contentious for some within Hamas.</p>

<p>In the 1990s he lived in the United States, where he was arrested on charges of raising funds for the movement's armed wing. He then lived in exile, including in Jordan, Egypt and Qatar.</p>

<p>He has previously been mentioned as a possible successor to Hamas leaders, without success so far.</p>

<h3><strong>Zaher Jabarin</strong></h3>

<p>Hamas's long-time treasurer was close to Haniyeh, and has sometimes been described as one of his right-hand men.</p>

<p>After being detained in Israeli prisons, he was released in 2011 as part of an exchange for the release of Gilad Shalit, an Israeli soldier held hostage for five years.</p>

<p>Jabarin, who has strong ties with Turkey, where he once lived, has recruited people for large-scale money-laundering activities, two of whom were arrested in Israel in 2018.</p>

<p>He has also taken part in deadly operations carried out by Hamas's armed wing.</p>

<h3><strong>Khaled Meshaal</strong></h3>

<p>Haniyeh's predecessor has lived in exile since 1967, in Jordan, Qatar, Syria and other countries.</p>

<p>He was propelled to the head of the movement after Israel killed Hamas's founder, Ahmed Yassin, and then his successor Abdelaziz al-Rantisi.</p>

<p>In 1997 Meshaal survived a poisoning assassination attempt in Amman by agents of Mossad, the Israeli intelligence service.</p>

<p>While living in Syria, he criticised the Damascus regime for its violent repression of anti-government protests, a crackdown which had caused friction with Iran, Syria's strategic ally and a major supporter of Hamas.</p>

<h3><strong>Yahya Sinwar</strong></h3>

<p>Sinwar, elected in February 2017 to lead Hamas in the Gaza Strip, is a hardliner and an alleged mastermind of the October 7 attack.</p>

<p>The ascetic 61-year-old spent 23 years in Israeli prisons before being released in 2011 as part of a prisoner exchange.</p>

<p>Born in Khan Yunis in the Gaza Strip, he joined Hamas when it was founded in 1987, the year of the first intifada or uprising.</p>

<p>He would go on to establish Majd, the group's internal security service.</p>

<p>The former elite commander in the Al-Qassam Brigades, Hamas's armed wing, is wanted by Israel and appears on the United States' list of sanctioned international terrorists.</p>

<p>Sinwar, who shrouds his movements in the highest secrecy, has not appeared in public since October 7.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An Al-Shabaab suicide bomber and gunmen attacked a busy beach in the Somali capital Mogadishu killing 37 people and wounding scores more, officials said on Saturday, in one of the deadliest strikes in the East African country in months.</p>

<p>The Al-Qaeda-linked jihadists have been waging an insurgency against the internationally backed federal government for more than 17 years and have previously targeted the Lido beach area, popular with business people and government members.</p>

<p>Survivors of Friday's assault described how following the blast gunmen stormed onto the beach intending to "kill everyone they could", with graphic video shared online immediately after showing bloodied bodies on the sand.</p>

<p>"The overall number of the dead people we confirmed is 37," Somali Health Minister Ali Haji Adam said in a press statement late Saturday.</p>

<p>Eleven people are in intensive care units, a further 64 people remain in hospital with wounds, while 137 people with light injuries had been discharged after receiving treatment, he said.</p>

<p>The assault, for which Al-Shabaab claimed responsibility in a post on a pro-Shabaab website, began late on Friday when a suicide bomber detonated a device and gunmen stormed the area.</p>

<p>Officer Mohamed Omar told AFP that members of the group had "shot civilians randomly".</p>

<p>He said security forces had ended the attack and killed five gunmen, while a sixth member of the group "blew himself (up) at the beach".</p>

<p>Police spokesperson Abdifatah Adan Hassan said the attack demonstrated the group was not only targeting government officials and soldiers, but ordinary civilians as well.</p>

<p>Witnesses said there were many people at the popular location when the explosion occurred, describing how gunmen then stormed the area.</p>

<p>'Killed everyone they could'</p>

<p>"As we were enjoying our time on the beach, a suicide bomber blew himself up among crowds of people on the beach," Omar Elmi told AFP.</p>

<p>"Then we could see many people scattered on the ground, including dead, injured, as well as shocked people," he said.</p>

<p>Another survivor, Harun Issa Wehliye, said one of his best friends had been killed in the explosion.</p>

<p>"After that, four armed men arrived and started shooting. They killed everyone they could," he told AFP.</p>

<p>Other witnesses had similar tales, with Hawo Mohamed, who lives near the scene, saying at least seven people he knew had died in the attack.</p>

<p>"The devastation is immense and there is blood and severed pieces of human flesh strewn in the scene," he told AFP.</p>

<p>Hospitals appealed for blood donations following the influx of wounded people, local media reported.</p>

<p>Mahad Abdiaziz Ibrahim was waiting in a long queue to donate blood, explaining to AFP it was "the best thing" he could do.</p>

<p>"I am donating my blood to help those who are in desperate need."</p>

<p>Lido beach hit again</p>

<p>President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud said on X that he would hold an emergency meeting with the prime minister and "key security officials to address the situation".</p>

<p>Prime Minister Hamza Abdi Barre described the attack in a statement as a "barbaric atrocity fundamentally contradictory to the cherished values of our religion and culture".</p>

<p>Al-Shabaab has claimed responsibility for numerous bombings and attacks in Mogadishu and other parts of Somalia, whose government is pursuing an offensive against the Islamist militants.</p>

<p>Moussa Faki Mahamat, chairman of the African Union's executive commission, expressed condolences for the victims in a tweet labelling the incident "horrific" and "callous".</p>

<p>The UN in Somalia called the attack "an abhorrent act that warrants the firmest condemnation".</p>

<p>The Lido area has been the target of previous attacks, including a six-hour Al-Shabaab siege of a beachside hotel in 2023 which left six civilians dead and 10 wounded.</p>

<p>Five people were killed in a powerful car bomb blast at a cafe in the capital last month.</p>

<p>In March, militants killed three people and wounded 27 in an hours-long siege of another Mogadishu hotel, breaking a relative lull in the fighting.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In response to the killing of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in its capital Tehran, Iran has arrested over two dozen individuals, including high-ranking intelligence officers, military officials, and staff at a military-run guesthouse in the capital, New York Times <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/03/world/middleeast/iran-security-response-hamas-assassination.html?smid=nytcore-android-share">reported</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Israel's elite intelligence agency Mossad enlisted Iranian security agents to plant explosives at the guesthouse where Haniyeh was staying. Haniyeh, who headed Hamas's political office in Qatar, was in Tehran for the inauguration of Iran's new president. The assassination, occurring just hours after the president's swearing-in ceremony, is seen as a massive intelligence and security failure for Iran.</p>

<p>"The perception that Iran can neither protect its homeland nor its key allies could be fatal for the Iranian regime because it basically signals to its foes that if they can't topple the Islamic Republic, they can decapitate it," said Ali Vaez, Iran director for the International Crisis Group, told New York Times.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>READ</strong> | <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/israel-hired-iranian-agents-to-assassinate-hamas-chief-in-tehran-report-6252736">2 Iran Agents, Bombs In 3 Rooms: Inside Mossad's Kill Op For Hamas Chief</a></p>

<p>Iranian security forces conducted thorough searches of the guesthouse compound. They detained staff, confiscated electronic devices, and scrutinised surveillance footage and guest lists. Senior military and intelligence officials responsible for Tehran's security were also interrogated, with several placed under arrest pending further investigation.</p>

<p>The compound, managed by the IRGC, housed Haniyeh in a room he frequently used during his Tehran visits.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps or IRGC's specialised intelligence unit for espionage has taken the lead in the investigation. The unit is actively pursuing suspects to uncover the network responsible for the assassination.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Iranian and Hamas officials have accused Israel of orchestrating the assassination, a stance supported by several US. officials. Israel, maintaining its stance on eliminating Hamas's military capabilities, has not acknowledged responsibility for the attack.</p>

<p>According to The Telegraph, Israel's initial plan was to assassinate Haniyeh in May during his visit to Tehran for the funeral of former Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi. The operation was aborted due to overwhelming crowds, which posed a major risk of failure, according to two Iranian officials who spoke to The Telegraph. Two agents, working under Mossad's direction, placed explosive devices in three separate rooms of the IRGC guesthouse in northern Tehran.</p>

<p>This assassination has been confirmed by officials within the IRGC, who now believe Mossad employed agents from the Ansar-al-Mahdi protection unit, a group responsible for safeguarding high-ranking officials inside and outside the country.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;Israel has previously targeted Iranian nuclear scientists and military commanders, including the high-profile killing of Mohsen Fakhrizadeh in 2020. These operations have often involved sophisticated technology and precise execution.</p>

<p>Days before Haniyeh's assassination, Iran's Minister of Intelligence, Seyed Esmaeil Khatib, claimed success in dismantling a Mossad infiltrator network. However, Haniyeh's killing contradicted these assurances of any security failure.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Authorities emphasized the severity of arson and its risks to public safety, crediting the collaboration of local and federal agencies for McGregor's prosecution.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A McDonald's restaurant employee, Joshua Daryl McGregor, was sentenced to five years in prison after he intentionally set the restaurant on fire in April 2023 in Savannah, Georgia. Frustrated by the influx of customers, McGregor set a piece of cardboard alight and flung it into a dumpster full of flammables outside the restaurant.</p>

<p>According to a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdga/pr/chatham-county-man-sentenced-federal-prison-lighting-dumpster-fire-temporarily-closed">release by the US attorney office</a>, the fire became so intense that customers in the drive-through lane had to back out of the parking lot, and the restaurant was forced to briefly close while the Savannah Fire Department extinguished the blaze. McGregor, who filmed the fire with his cell phone, was identified on surveillance video as starting the fire. He was arrested by Savannah Police Department investigators, and in May pled guilty to arson in US District Court.</p>

<p>"Intentionally setting a fire in an effort to shut down or damage someone else's property is inexcusable," <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdga/pr/chatham-county-man-sentenced-federal-prison-lighting-dumpster-fire-temporarily-closed">said US Attorney Steinberg</a>. "Joshua McGregor will have substantial time to ponder his post-prison employment options."</p>

<p>"Arson is an extremely violent crime that not only destroys property but also places firefighters, first responders and the general public at great risk," said Beau Kolodka, Assistant Special Agent in Charge for the ATF Atlanta Field Division. "The ATF, along with the Savannah Fire's Arson Unit and our other law enforcement partners, are committed to ensuring that our communities are safe and that those who commit these dangerous acts are held accountable."</p>

<p>"Savannah Fire's Arson Unit greatly appreciates our continued ability to work with our local and federal partners to successfully prosecute arson that effects interstate commerce in our jurisdiction," said Fred Anderson, chief investigator for the Savannah Fire Arson Unit. "These efforts made as a partnership have continued to help make our community safer and greatly reduce the act of arson throughout the city."&nbsp;</p>

<p>The case was investigated by the Savannah Fire Department, the Savannah Police Department, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, and prosecuted for the United States by Southern District of Georgia Special Assistant U.S. Attorney Makeia R Jonese.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Turkish shooter Yusuf Dikec, who won a silver medal at the Paris Olympics 2024 in the 10m air pistol competition, became a viral sensation for his “gearless” look. His casual demeanour and the decision to not wear protective earplugs or special lenses made him a social media trend. Yusuf Dikec wore regular spectacles and a team T-shirt, his left hand nonchalantly resting in his pants pocket.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">Several rumours circulated after he won the medal, one of which said that the 51-year-old took up shooting following a tumultuous divorce. Some social media users also claimed that Dikec was a mechanic who turned to shooting following a challenging divorce.</p>

<p dir="ltr">A Facebook page published a post claiming to explain his background, describing him as a mechanic who took up shooting following a rocky divorce. The post also claimed that Dikec took a jibe at his former spouse while receiving his silver medal.</p>

<p dir="ltr">However, the narrative was a complete satire.</p>

<p dir="ltr">According to a&nbsp;<a href="https://people.com/no-viral-turkish-shooter-yusuf-dikec-did-not-ask-ex-wife-return-dog-2024-paris-olympics-8687912">People</a> report, Dikec started shooting competitively in 2001, following his employment with the Gendarmerie General Command as a non-commissioned officer.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">He's a four-time Olympian, having competed in 2008, 2012, 2016 and 2020.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said late Friday he had agreed with Fox News to debate Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris on September 4.</p>

<p>"I have agreed with FoxNews to debate Kamala Harris on Wednesday, September 4th," Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform, but it was not immediately clear if Harris had agreed to the debate.</p>

<p>Trump's post came hours after Harris secured the Democratic party's presidential nomination as party standard bearer in November's election.</p>

<p>Trump's White House bid was turned upside down on July 21 when President Biden, 81, facing growing concerns about his age and lagging polling numbers, withdrew his candidacy and backed Harris.</p>

<p>Biden bowed out following a disastrous debate performance against Trump in June on CNN.</p>

<p>A second Trump-Biden televised debate had been scheduled for September 10 on ABC television.</p>

<p>That was expected to remain in place, with Harris replacing Biden, but Trump's spokesman Steven Cheung last week said it was "inappropriate" to schedule it before Harris was formally the Democratic nominee.</p>

<p>In his post Trump gave details of the debate venue and the moderators, saying it it would be held before a full audience.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

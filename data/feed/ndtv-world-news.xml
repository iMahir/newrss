       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden and his counterpart from the United Arab Emirates Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed discussed the progress of the landmark India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC) and underscored its potential to usher in a "new era of international connectivity".</p>

<p>The ambitious project was launched at the 2023 G20 Leaders' Summit in New Delhi, together with the leaders of India, Saudi Arabia, France, Germany, Italy, and the European Union. When complete, it would connect India by ship-to-rail connections through the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Israel, and Europe through Greece.</p>

<p>At the meeting held at the White House on Monday, Biden and Zayed reaffirmed that the corridor will generate economic growth, increase efficiencies, lower greenhouse gas emissions, and enable the transformative integration of Asia, Europe, and the Middle East, according to a joint statement.</p>

<p>The two leaders underscored that the transformative partnership had the potential to usher in a "new era of international connectivity" to facilitate global trade and clean energy distribution, expand reliable access to electricity, and strengthen telecommunication.</p>

<p>According to the statement, they emphasised the importance of joint initiatives to promote a circular economy and advance sustainable practices, underscoring their commitment to innovation for resource efficiency and environmentally responsible growth.</p>

<p>Earlier, welcoming Zayed to the White House, Biden said UAE is a nation of trailblazers which always looking to the future and making big bets.&nbsp; "That's something our countries have in common, and our people have in common. In fact, it's a cornerstone of our growing cooperation in AI, in clean energy, in space, and investing in infrastructure to connect regions," he said.</p>

<p>Biden also announced plans to make UAE a major defence partner of the United States, which is the only other country after India to get this status.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The U.S. does not support the escalation between Israel and Hezbollah across the border, a senior State Department official said, adding that Washington was going to discuss "concrete ideas" with allies and partners to prevent the war from broadening.</p>

<p>Israel launched airstrikes against Hezbollah targets on Monday, killing 492 people and sending tens of thousands fleeing for safety in Lebanon's deadliest day in decades, according to authorities.</p>

<p>Israeli officials have said the recent uptick in airstrikes on Hezbollah targets in Lebanon was designed to force the Iran-aligned group to agree to a diplomatic solution.</p>

<p>But the U.S. State Department official, briefing reporters in New York on condition of anonymity, pushed back on this Israeli position, saying President Joe Biden's administration was focused on "reducing tensions ... and breaking the cycle of strike-counterstrike."</p>

<p>"I can't recall, at least in recent memory, a period in which an escalation or intensification led to a fundamental de- escalation and led to profound stabilization of the situation," the official said.</p>

<p>Asked if that is a disagreement with the Israeli stance, the U.S. official nodded.</p>

<p>The spiraling conflict over Israel's northern border with Lebanon is a focus for Secretary of State Antony Blinken on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly this week. Washington had "concrete ideas" to prevent a broader war and would seek an "off ramp" to tensions, the official said.</p>

<p>"It's an evolution of those discussions on which we're trying to base some practical, concrete steps that will have good chances of reducing tensions and actually getting some traction," the official said.</p>

<p>Asked if Washington believes Israel is preparing for an ground invasion of Lebanon, the U.S. official declined to answer definitively.</p>

<p>"We obviously do not believe that a ground invasion of Lebanon is going to contribute to reducing tensions in the region," he said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli air strikes on Lebanon killed at least 492 people on Monday, including 35 children, the health ministry said, marking the deadliest day of cross-border violence since the Gaza war began.</p>

<p>Arab states strongly condemned Israel for the escalating hostilities with Hezbollah, which have intensified to levels unseen in nearly a year.</p>

<p>The war erupted after Hamas and other Palestinian militants launched the unprecedented October 7 attack on Israel, drawing in Hezbollah and other Iran-backed groups.</p>

<p>Israel said it killed a "large number" of Hezbollah militants when it hit about 1,300 sites in southern and eastern Lebanon, including a "targeted strike" in Beirut.</p>

<p>Hezbollah said Ali Karake, its third-in-command, was alive and had moved to safety after a source said the strike on the capital targeted him.</p>

<p>State media reported new raids in eastern Lebanon, while Hezbollah said it targeted five sites in Israel.</p>

<p>In the coastal Israeli city of Haifa, people were seen running for cover when air raid sirens sounded.</p>

<p>Lebanon's health ministry said the strikes killed 492 people, including 35 children and 58 women, and wounded 1,645 others. Health Minister Firass Abiad said "thousands of families" had been displaced.</p>

<p>Explosions near the ancient city of Baalbek in eastern Lebanon sent smoke billowing into the sky.</p>

<p>"We sleep and wake up to bombardment... that's what our life has become," said Wafaa Ismail, 60, a housewife from the southern village of Zawtar.</p>

<p>- 'Most difficult week for Hezbollah' -</p>

<p>Global powers urged Israel and Hezbollah to step back from the brink of all-out war, as the violence shifted from Israel's southern border with Gaza to its northern frontier with Lebanon.</p>

<p>Egypt called on the United Nations Security Council to intervene, while Iraq requested an urgent meeting of Arab states on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York.</p>

<p>Israeli army chief Herzi Halevi said the strikes hit combat infrastructure Hezbollah had been building for two decades.</p>

<p>Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant called Monday "a significant peak" in the operation.</p>

<p>"This is the most difficult week for Hezbollah since its establishment –- the results speak for themselves," he said.</p>

<p>"Entire units were taken out of battle as a result of the activities conducted at the beginning of the week in which numerous terrorists were injured."</p>

<p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel was acting to change the "security balance" in the north.</p>

<p><strong>- Hezbollah wave of rockets -</strong></p>

<p>Hezbollah, which has been trading near-daily fire with Israel in support of Hamas, said it was in a "new phase" of confrontation.</p>

<p>The group said it launched rockets at Israeli military sites near Haifa and two bases in retaliation for Israeli strikes on the south and the Bekaa.</p>

<p>The attack came after an Israeli strike on southern Beirut Friday killed its elite Radwan Force commander, Ibrahim Aqil, and coordinated communications device blasts that Hezbollah blamed on Israel killed 39 people and wounded almost 3,000 on Tuesday and Wednesday.</p>

<p>Since the cross-border exchanges between Israel and Hezbollah began in October, tens of thousands of people on both sides have fled their homes.</p>

<p>An Israeli military official, who cannot be further identified under military rules, said the operation seeks to "degrade threats" from Hezbollah, push them back from the border, and then to destroy infrastructure.</p>

<p>Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati urged the United Nations and world powers to deter what he called Israel's "plan that aims to destroy Lebanese villages and towns".</p>

<p><strong>- Guterres 'gravely alarmed' -</strong></p>

<p>US President Joe Biden, whose country is Israel's main ally and weapons supplier, said his country was "working to de-escalate in a way that allows people to return home safely".</p>

<p>The Pentagon said it was sending a small number of additional US military personnel to the Middle East after thousands were deployed earlier alongside warships, fighter jets and air defence systems.</p>

<p>UN chief Antonio Guterres was "gravely alarmed" by civilian casualties in Lebanon, his spokesman said.</p>

<p>The United Nations peacekeeping force in south Lebanon warned "any further escalation of this dangerous situation could have far-reaching and devastating consequences".</p>

<p>Turkey said the Israeli strikes threatened to plunge the region into "chaos", while Jordan urged an immediate end to the escalation in Lebanon "before it is too late", renewing accusations that Israeli actions were precipitating a "comprehensive regional war".</p>

<p>The Palestinian foreign ministry condemned the strikes and ordered Palestinian medical staff in Lebanon to provide support for the wounded.</p>

<p>Iran's newly elected president, Masoud Pezeshkian, accused Israel of seeking "to create this wider conflict".</p>

<p>Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,205 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures that include hostages killed in captivity.</p>

<p>Of the 251 hostages also seized by militants, 97 are still held in Gaza, including 33 the Israeli military says are dead.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory military offensive has killed at least 41,455 people in Gaza, most of them civilians, according to figures provided by the Hamas-run territory's health ministry. The UN has described the figures as reliable.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi, speaking at the United Nations Summit of the Future on Monday, said alongside terrorism, new areas of conflict are emerging and it is high time that "global action must match global ambition".</p>

<p>Pointing out that terrorism continues to be a serious threat to global peace and security, PM Modi said on the other hand, "cyber, maritime and space are emerging as new areas of conflict".</p>

<p>"On all these issues, I will stress that global action must match global ambition," he added.</p>

<p>Talking of growing global concern over dangers from new and evolving technologies, especially artificial intelligence, PM Modi said, "There is a need for balanced regulation at a global level, for the safe and responsible use of technology."</p>

<p>According to the Wilmington Declaration - made two days ago at the Quad meet -- leaders of the US, Australia, Japan and India announced their intention to enhance cybersecurity partnership.</p>

<p>"In the face of a deteriorating security environment in the cyber domain, Quad countries intend to enhance our cybersecurity partnership to address common threats posed by state-sponsored actors, cybercriminals, and other non-state malicious actors. Our countries commit to taking concrete steps to increase our collective network defense and advance technical capabilities through greater threat information sharing and capacity building," read the joint declaration.</p>

<p>The leaders, in their declaration, had unequivocally condemned terrorism and violent extremism in all its forms and manifestations, including cross-border terrorism.</p>

<p>"We are committed to international cooperation and will work with our regional partners in a comprehensive and sustained manner to strengthen their capability to prevent, detect and respond to threats posed by terrorism and violent extremism, including threats posed by the use of new and emerging technologies for terrorist purposes, consistent with international law," the statement had added.</p>

<p>"When we are discussing the global future, we must accord the highest priority to a human-centric approach while prioritising sustainable development," PM Modi also said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We must also ensure human welfare, food and health security," he added, declaring India was ready to share her experience in poverty eradication and bridging the digital divide.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The South American jungle, spanning nine countries, is seen as crucial to the fight against climate change due to its ability to absorb planet-warming carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.</p>

<p>Deforestation, mainly for mining and agricultural purposes, has led to the loss of 12.5 percent of the Amazon's plant cover from 1985 to 2023, according to RAISG, a collective of researchers and NGOs.</p>

<p>This amounts to 88 million hectares (880,000 square kilometers, 339,773 square miles) of forest cover lost across Brazil, Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela, Guyana, Suriname and French Guiana.</p>

<p>RAISG experts reported an "accelerated transformation" of the Amazon, with an "alarming increase" in the use of land previously occupied by forest for mining, crops, or livestock.</p>

<p>"A large number of ecosystems have disappeared to give way to immense expanses of pastures, soybean fields or other monocultures, or have been transformed into craters for gold mining," they said.</p>

<p>"With the loss of the forest, we emit more carbon into the atmosphere and this disrupts an entire ecosystem that regulates the climate and the hydrological cycle, clearly affecting temperatures," Sandra Rio Caceres, from the Institute of the Common Good -- a Peruvian association that took part in the study -- told AFP.</p>

<p>She said she believes the loss of vegetation in the Amazon is directly linked to severe drought and wildfires affecting several South American countries.</p>

<p>The World Weather Attribution network of scientists said Sunday that climate change was increasing the risk and severity of fires in the Amazon and Pantanal wetlands which are releasing "massive amounts" of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.</p>

<p>"Never-ending heat has combined with low rainfall to turn these precious ecosystems into highly flammable tinderboxes," said Clair Barnes, a researcher from Imperial College London.</p>

<p>"As long as the world burns fossil fuels, the risk of devastating wildfires will continue to increase in the Amazon and Pantanal," she added.</p>

<p>The drought has placed some Amazon rivers at their lowest level in decades, threatening the lifestyle of some 47 million people who live on their banks.</p>

<p>The dry spell has sent fires -- often lit to clear land for farming -- burning out of control in Brazil, Ecuador, Colombia, and Peru.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[In New Mexico, scientists are exploring a futuristic solution to defend Earth against asteroid threats: harnessing X-ray blasts from nuclear explosions.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Asteroid collisions with Earth are surprisingly common, with NASA estimating 48.5 tonnes of meteoric material entering our atmosphere daily. Most burn up, producing shooting stars. Although devastating asteroid impacts are rare in Earth's history, humanity has learned a crucial lesson from the catastrophic event 66 million years ago. The asteroid responsible for the dinosaurs' extinction was approximately six miles wide, but significantly smaller objects still pose a significant threat.&nbsp;In the face of potentially catastrophic asteroid impacts, scientists are racing to develop innovative solutions to protect our planet.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In New Mexico, scientists are exploring a futuristic solution to defend Earth against asteroid threats: harnessing X-ray blasts from nuclear explosions, the <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2024/sep/23/nuclear-blast-could-save-earth-from-large-asteroid">Guardian</a></em> reported. Scientists at Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque have&nbsp;successfully demonstrated a revolutionary method to deflect incoming asteroids using nuclear explosions. For the experiment, researchers harnessed the power of X-rays from a nuclear blast to vaporise the surface of a nearby asteroid.</p>

<p>The process works by unleashing an immense pulse of radiation, heating the asteroid's surface to tens of thousands of degrees. This creates a rapidly expanding ball of gas that can nudge the asteroid off its catastrophic course. By precisely calculating the blast's impact, scientists believe this technique can effectively push threatening asteroids away from Earth, potentially saving humanity from doomsday.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The primary mechanism involves using X-rays to rapidly heat the target surface, causing it to vaporize and expand into the adjacent vacuum. The expanding gas pushes against the asteroid, transferring momentum (in the opposite direction)," authors of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-024-02633-7">study</a>&nbsp;published Monday in the journal Nature Physics wrote.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Scientists noted that the nuclear option is for larger asteroids, particularly when time is short. Researchers believe this strategy can effectively deflect asteroids up to 2.5 miles wide, although this isn't a rigid limit.</p>

<p>“If there is enough warning time, one can certainly deflect larger asteroids,” &nbsp;Dr Nathan Moore, the first author of the study said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mr Moore and his team plan to conduct further experimental tests to refine the X-ray deflection technique, building on their initial success. Their goal is to enhance the method's effectiveness through additional laboratory experiments. Ultimately, they envision a space-based demonstration, similar to NASA's DART (Double Asteroid Redirection Test) mission, to test the technique on a real asteroid.&nbsp;</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Prime Minister Narendra Modi today called for reforms in the top global bodies, saying, "The success of humanity lies in our collective strength, not in the battlefield".]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi today reiterated his message for world peace and called for reforms in top global institutions from the high platform of the UN General Assembly. "Reform is the key to relevance," he said.&nbsp;Speaking at the "Summit Of The Future" at the United Nations headquarters in New York, PM Modi said, "The success of humanity lies in our collective strength, not in the battlefield and for world peace and development, reform is essential for global organisations".</p>

<p>"For global peace and security, on the one hand there is a big threat like terrorism, on the other hand many new fields of conflict like cyber, maritime, space are also being created. On all these subjects, I would like to emphasize that Global Action must match Global Ambition,' he added.</p>

<p>PM Modi's message for peace comes after the UN General Assembly, which convened yesterday, adopted a "Pact for the Future" -- designed to address 21st Century challenges including climate change, conflict, and human rights.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It was adopted despite resistance by a band of seven nations -- led by Russia which is currently engaged in armed conflict with Ukraine.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Russia criticised the pact contending that the countries not satisfied with the agreement had not been given the opportunity for further negotiations.</p>

<p>"Regrettably, there is nothing good that today the United Nations adopted a Pact for the Future. The United Nations had infringed upon its own principles to pander to a group of delegations from the 'beautiful garden,' who have usurped the talks from the very beginning. And the majority from the 'jungle,' like a herd, could not find courage enough to protest and defend their rights. This is they who will bear responsibility for the consequences," Russia's First Deputy Permanent Representative to the United Nations Dmitry Polyansky said on his X account as cited by TASS.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[According to court documents, Sasser met David Wallace on Match.com and became obsessed after he revealed his engagement.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Melody Sasser, a 48-year-old Tennessee woman, was sentenced to 100 months in prison for attempting to hire a hitman to kill the wife of a man she met on a dating website. According to <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://people.com/woman-tried-hire-hitman-kill-wife-man-met-match-seem-random-8715907">People,</a></em> Sasser used the dark website "Online Killers Market" to seek a hitman, offering $9,750 in Bitcoin for a "random" or "accident" killing.&nbsp;According to court documents, Sasser met David Wallace on Match.com and became obsessed after he revealed his engagement.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mr Wallace told investigators that their relationship was limited to hiking companionship.&nbsp;Sasser had assisted him on an Appalachian Trail hike and they had also explored trails together in the Knoxville area before he relocated to Alabama&nbsp;and married his now-wife.</p>

<p>However, Sasser's interest evolved into an unhealthy obsession.&nbsp;After learning of his engagement, she showed up at his Alabama home, making disturbing threats and beginning a campaign of harassment against his now-wife.&nbsp;Sasser monitored the couple's activities using a fitness app and harassed the wife with six phone calls in one day.</p>

<p>''It needs to seem random or accident. or plant drugs, do not want a long investigation. She recently moved in with her new husband,” she wrote on the website, including details such as the couple's license plate numbers and the wife's workplace.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sasser also notified the website administrator when he left her home for a mere two-mile walk.</p>

<p>"I have waited for two months and 11 days and the job is not completed. 2 weeks ago you said it has been worked on and would be done in a week. The job is still not done. Does it need to be assigned to someone else? Will it be done? What is the delay? When will it be done," Sasser wrote in a follow-up message to the website's administrator.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the plan was unsuccessful. During the search of her home, law enforcement uncovered incriminating evidence, including a journal detailing multiple hitman websites and a handwritten account of her communications with the notorious "Online Killers Market". Additionally, investigators found a stash of cash hidden beneath a sticky note bearing a Bitcoin address.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As a result, a federal grand jury indicted Sasser in June last year for utilising interstate commerce facilities to facilitate murder-for-hire. Sasser ultimately accepted responsibility for her crimes through a plea deal. On Wednesday, she received her sentence: 100 months in prison, accompanied by an order to pay over $5,300 in restitution to the victim.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Sri Lanka has made history by voting leftist Anura Kumara Dissanayake to power.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sri Lanka has made history by voting leftist Anura Kumara Dissanayake to power. The people rejected all the known and tested political leaders and dynasts - Rajapaksa, Wickremesinghe and Premadasa - who, according to them, contributed to the island nation's economic collapse.</p>

<p>The Election Commission declared AKD, as Dissanayake is popularly known, as the winner after the second round of counting. Dissanayake won 5.7 million (42.3%) votes after two rounds of counting in the nation's first-ever second preference vote count - defeating Sajith Premadasa of the SJB (Samagi Jana Balawegaya), who got 4.5 million (32.8%). It was a big defeat for incumbent President Ranil Wickremesinghe, who fought as an independent and was a distant third with 17.3% votes. Namal Rajapaksa, the son of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, managed only 2.4% of the total votes.</p>

<p>It is a robust victory for Dissanayake, the leader of the Marxist JVP (Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna) and also the broader front NPP (National Peoples Power), which had won just over 3% of votes in the previous presidential election in 2019. It also reflects the extent of Sri Lankans' distrust of the old regime.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Soon after his win, Dissanayake wrote on X: "This achievement is not the result of any single person's work, but the collective effort of hundreds of thousands of you. Your commitment has brought us this far, and for that, I am deeply grateful. This victory belongs to all of us."</p>

<p><strong>Pragmatic leader</strong></p>

<p>An analysis of Dissanayake's political career reveals that he is a pragmatic leader who knows how to deal with global political realities despite his ideological moorings rooted in Marxism.</p>

<p>Dissanayake's political activism began when he was a university leader in the early 1990s, and it brought him close to the JVP (Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna), a left-wing Marxist-Leninist party mainly consisting of Sinhalese rural youth and known for its armed uprisings in 1971 and 1987-89. It is interesting to note that JVP's origins are linked to a faction within the Communist Party of Sri Lanka (CPSL) in the 1960s, mostly in its pro-China bloc.</p>

<p>However, ground-level electoral politics forced JVP to temper its stand, which had a positive impact on leaders like Dissanayake, who became the party's national organiser in 1997. In 2000, he became an MP. His elevation as JVP chief came after a long wait, in 2014. Dissanayake's flexibility and willingness to learn enabled him to grasp Sri Lanka's economic issues and relate to the rural and working-class citizens, especially through the country's worst economic crises in the late 2010s and early 2020s. His brief stint as Agriculture Minister also helped him connect with Sri Lanka's rural agricultural sector, setting him apart from the political elite.</p>

<p>Incandescent anger against the political elite over an economic mess saw Sri Lankans overthrow the Rajapaksa family in 2022. To voters fed up with steep inflation, food, fuel and medicine shortages and swelling debt, Dissanayake's anti-corruption stance and promise of political reforms appealed to the masses, especially the youth.</p>

<p>The victory will be overwhelming both for Dissanayake and JVP. This is their first time in power, and the lack of experience could be a worry domestically as well as internationally.</p>

<p>India is closely observing the developments in its neighbourhood, just a couple of hours away by speed boat from its southern tip Rameswaram. So is China, which is striving to increase its influence over the island nation.</p>

<p>Sri Lanka has undeniably moved towards China in the past 15 years, handing many lucrative projects to the country. Among other projects, China snagged one to develop an airport in Colombo. Earlier, the strategically important Hambantota Port, situated along the world's busiest shipping lane linking Asia and Europe was given to China, which gave it an upper hand in the region.</p>

<p><strong>India's stakes</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
India has splurged millions of dollars in the form of aid and loans to ensure stability in Sri Lanka, its closest neighbour.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi congratulated Dissanayake on his victory and said he looks forward to working closely with him to further strengthen the Indo-Lanka multifaceted cooperation.</p>

<p>In his response on Monday (Sept 23), Dissanayake thanked PM Modi for his 'kind' words and support and said he shared his commitment to strengthening ties.</p>

<p>Historically, JVP has been anti-India, especially during the late 1980s, when the party held agitations against Indian imports, including medicines and drugs.</p>

<p>India will also be concerned about the Tamil population in Sri Lanka, as Dissanayake's party has had a complex and antagonistic relationship with Tamil nationalism and LTTE. The JVP opposed the Indo-Sri Lanka Peace Accord in 1987, and did not support the implementation of the 13th amendment of the Sri Lankan Constitution, which delegates powers to the country's Tamil minority.</p>

<p>A majority of Tamils did not vote for Dissanayake, given what they believe is the apathy of his alliance NPP towards Tamils' political demands. Whether Dissanayake, after taking office, will reach out to the country's Tamil minority will be watched.</p>

<p>Experts believe that the rigid stance may not hold up against the strategic geopolitical realities. Dissanayake displayed his eagerness to engage with India as early as February 2024 and met with Foreign Minister S Jaishankar and National Security Adviser Ajit Doval.</p>

<p>Sri Lankans have reposed their faith in Dissanayake as their last hope. They are yet to experience his rule or his policies. His recent speeches do suggest a more nuanced approach, moderating his Left-leaning position. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>Dissanayake has a lot on his plate on the domestic front, and fixing the economy will be his priority. He is expected to dissolve parliament and call parliamentary elections soon. Some of his public statements and decisions didn't seem to favour India's interests in the recent past.</p>

<p>India needs to use its diplomatic channels to ensure that Indian investments like the wind power project in the northern part of Sri Lanka are not jeopardised. Given the project's strategic location in northern Sri Lanka, any setback could mean a Chinese company or its proxy taking over, which would be a concern given the significance of the region and the presence of the Tamil minority.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Speaking at the "UN Summit of the Future" on Saturday, Google CEO Sundar Pichai has said that he wants to close the "AI Divide" and pledged 120 million USD for AI training and education around the world, according to a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://blog.google/inside-google/message-ceo/united-nations-keynote-2024/">blog</a> on Google.</p>

<p>Pichai addressed the United Nations General assembly (UNGA) at the very first "UN Summit of the Future," delivering the keynote speech. Pichai announced "Global AI Opportunity Fund" at the event and said that the AI education will be done in local languages, in partnerships with nonprofits and NGOs.</p>

<p>Pichai expressed his confidence in AI being the most transformative technology yet, and shared his personal experience as to how technology changed his life, being born and brought up in Chennai. He mentioned four ways through which AI technology has potential for transformative change: access to information in one's own language, AI driven scientific discoveries, AI's climate-related disaster management systems, and AI's contribution to the world economy.</p>

<p>However, Pichai also cautioned regarding AI's potential for harm as well. He expressed concerns of accuracy, biasness as well as misapplication of AI like in case of deep fakes. Pichai also called for regulations that do not give into protectionist impulses, enabling wider reach of AI technologies for equal opportunity.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kelly Andrade, a 25-year-old live-in nanny, has been awarded a $2.78 million payout after discovering she was secretly videotaped by her millionaire boss, Michael Esposito, at his New York home. Ms Andrade, from Colombia, cared for Esposito's four children while living with the family, the <em><u><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/09/22/us-news/nyc-jury-awards-au-pair-who-was-secretly-filmed-by-creepy-chicken-mogul-employer-2-78m/" rel="nofollow, noindex">New York Post</a></u></em> reported.&nbsp; However, her job abruptly ended when she found a hidden camera in a smoke detector in her bedroom.&nbsp;The twisted episode unfolded in 2021.</p>

<aside>
<p>Ms Andrade's suspicions arose after noticing Esposito frequently adjusting the smoke detector, which was constantly repositioned. Her worst fears were confirmed when she discovered a hidden camera inside, containing a memory card filled with hundreds of recordings – many of which captured intimate moments of her nude or dressing/undressing. Within minutes of her finding the device, Esposito showed up at the house.&nbsp;Fearing for her safety, she escaped through a window when he arrived home and started banging on her door.</p>

<p>''He seemed very nervous and he seemed very worried when he arrived at the house,'' she recalled.</p>

<p>Esposito was arrested on suspicion of illegal surveillance, which carries a maximum four-year prison sentence. However, he was allowed to walk free after agreeing to two years of probation and counselling. A Manhattan jury awarded Ms Andrade $780,000 in emotional distress damages against Esposito and his wife Danielle, plus $2 million in punitive damages against him.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Japan lodged a "very serious protest" with Moscow after a Russian patrol plane entered its airspace three times, the defence minister said Monday, calling it the first confirmed incursion since 2019.</p>

<p>The military responded by scrambling fighter jets and issuing radio and flare warnings, Japan's Defense Minister Minoru Kihara told reporters.</p>

<p>"We confirmed today that a Russian Il-38 patrol aircraft has violated our airspace over our territorial waters north of Rebun Island, Hokkaido, on three occasions," he said.</p>

<p>"The airspace violation is extremely regrettable and today we lodged a very serious protest with the Russian government via diplomatic channels and strongly urged them to prevent a recurrence."</p>

<p>Japan has supported the Western position on Ukraine, providing Kyiv with financial and material support and sanctioning Russian individuals and organisations after Moscow's invasion of its neighbour.</p>

<p>Mr Kihara said it was "the first publicly announced airspace incursion by a Russian aircraft since June 2019", when a Tu-95 bomber entered Japanese airspace in southern Okinawa and around the Izu Islands south of Tokyo.</p>

<p>In 2023, an aircraft believed but not confirmed to be Russian entered Japanese airspace, according to the defence ministry.</p>

<p>Top government spokesman Yoshimasa Hayashi also said on Monday that "we will refrain from giving any definitive information on the intent and purpose of this action, but the Russian military has been active in the vicinity of our country since the invasion of Ukraine".</p>

<p>Japan also scrambled fighter jets this month when Russian aircraft flew around the archipelago for the first time since 2019.</p>

<p>The Tu-142 planes did not enter Japanese airspace but flew over an area subject to a territorial dispute between Japan and Russia, Tokyo said.</p>

<p>Russian and Chinese warships recently held joint drills in the Sea of Japan, part of a major naval exercise that President Vladimir Putin said was the largest of its kind for three decades.</p>

<p>Japan scrambled fighter jets in August after the first confirmed incursion by a Chinese military aircraft into its airspace, with Tokyo calling it a "serious violation" of its sovereignty.</p>

<p>Then last week, a Chinese aircraft carrier sailed between two Japanese islands near Taiwan for the first time. Japan called that incident "totally unacceptable from the perspective of the security environment of Japan and the region".</p>

<p>China said the passage complied with international law.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[Despite his decade-long absence, the government official remarkably escaped termination or penalties, continuing to collect his salary and bonuses without interruption.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A shocking scandal has rocked Thailand, exposing the country's deep-seated corruption issues. According to the <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scmp.com/news/people-culture/article/3279397/thai-official-inactive-10-years-continues-receive-salary-while-working-nightclub" rel="nofollow, noindex">South China Morning Post</a></em>, a government official from the Disaster Prevention and Mitigation Department in Ang Thong province allegedly received a salary and bonuses for 10 years without ever showing up to work. The reason? He was too busy singing at a nightclub to bother with his day job. The official was constantly exhausted from working at night, which led him to skip work during the day.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Despite his decade-long absence, the government official remarkably escaped termination or penalties, continuing to collect his salary and bonuses without interruption. To maintain a facade of accountability, he would periodically receive a summons to the office to receive reprimands or sign documents at the mayor's behest - a strategic move seemingly designed to dodge scrutiny.</p>

<p>The shocking case of misconduct was only revealed thanks to a Facebook page called Watchdog, dedicated to exposing government wrongdoing. The page has garnered 1.1 million followers, highlighting the widespread concern over corruption in Thailand. According to Transparency International's 2023 Corruption Perceptions Index, Thailand scored a dismal 35 out of 100, ranking 108th out of 180 countries. A staggering 88% of Thai respondents view government corruption as a significant problem, with 24% admitting to paying bribes in the past year.</p>

<p>This incident has sparked outrage, with many questioning the government's lack of accountability. Under Thai law, corrupt officials can face one to 10 years in prison and fines ranging from 2,000 to 20,000 baht ($60 to $600).&nbsp;The local government has maintained silence regarding the case,&nbsp;and it remains unclear whether or how the official will be punished.</p>

<p>Notably, this isn't an isolated incident. Another case involves a family in Nakhon Ratchasima province, who endured six years of bullying by their neighbour – a government official and son of a high-ranking police officer. Despite reporting the abuse, the family faced legal threats, and the perpetrator remains uncharged.</p>

<p>Thailand's public sector employs approximately 1.68 million workers, including 421,000 civil servants. Once coveted for their financial security and benefits, these jobs are now losing appeal among young people, who increasingly opt for riskier careers to pursue their passions.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli air strikes killed 356 people, including 24 children, in Lebanon on Monday, the Lebanese health minister said, in the deadliest cross-border escalation since war erupted in Gaza on October 7.</p>

<p>The war began when Palestinian group Hamas launched the worst-ever attack on Israel, with Hezbollah and other Iran-backed groups around the region drawn into the violence.</p>

<p>Israel said it hit about 1,100 Hezbollah sites in southern and eastern Lebanon in 24 hours, including a "targeted strike" in Beirut.</p>

<p>A source close to Hezbollah said the strike on the capital targeted Ali Karake, the group's third in command after the killing of key commanders in earlier strikes.</p>

<p>Lebanese state media reported new raids in the country's east, while Hezbollah said it targeted five sites in Israel.</p>

<p>Israelis ran for cover when air raid sirens sounded in the coastal city of Haifa, which had been targeted a day earlier.</p>

<p>The Israeli strikes killed 274 people in Lebanon, including 21 children and 39 women, Health Minister Firass Abiad said, adding about 5,000 people had been wounded since Tuesday.</p>

<p>World powers have implored Israel and Hezbollah to pull back from the brink of all-out war, with the focus of violence shifting sharply in recent days from Israel's southern front with Gaza to its northern border with Lebanon.</p>

<p>"We sleep and wake up to bombardment... that's what our life has become," said Wafaa Ismail, 60, a housewife from the southern Lebanese village of Zawtar.</p>

<p><strong>More to come</strong></p>

<p>The Israeli military said it hit "approximately 800 Hezbollah terror targets in southern Lebanon and in the area of Bekaa deep inside Lebanese territory".</p>

<p>Israeli army chief Herzi Halevi said the strikes hit combat infrastructure Hezbollah had been building for two decades.</p>

<p>The military also warned people living in the Bekaa valley, in eastern Lebanon, to flee their homes, as it announced it was "broadening" the scope of its strikes.</p>

<p>Abiad said "thousands of families from the targeted areas have been displaced".</p>

<p>Explosions near the ancient city of Baalbek in eastern Lebanon sent smoke billowing into the sky.</p>

<p>Hezbollah said it had fired rockets at military sites near Haifa and later launched "dozens of rockets" at two Israeli bases "in response to the Israeli enemy's attacks on the south and the Bekaa".</p>

<p>Hezbollah, a powerful political and military force in Lebanon, has exchanged near-daily fire with Israel in support for its Palestinian ally Hamas.</p>

<p><strong>Israel changing 'security balance'</strong></p>

<p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel was acting to change the "security balance" in the north by preempting threats.</p>

<p>Hezbollah's deputy chief, Naim Qassem, said Sunday the group was in a "new phase, namely an open reckoning" with Israel and was ready for "all military possibilities".</p>

<p>They spoke after Hezbollah rocket attacks on northern Israel caused damage in the Haifa area.</p>

<p>The attack came after an Israeli air strike on southern Beirut Friday killed its elite Radwan Force commander, Ibrahim Aqil, and coordinated communications device blasts that Hezbollah blamed on Israel killed 39 people and wounded almost 3,000 on Tuesday and Wednesday.</p>

<p>"No country can live like this," said Ofer Levy, 56, a customs officer who lives near Haifa.</p>

<p>Since the cross-border exchanges between Israel and Hezbollah began in October, tens of thousands of people on both sides have fled their homes.</p>

<p>An Israeli military official, who cannot be further identified under military rules, said the military operation seeks to "degrade threats" from Hezbollah, push them back from the border, and then to destroy infrastructure near the frontier.</p>

<p>Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati urged the United Nations and world powers to deter what he called Israel's "plan that aims to destroy Lebanese villages and towns".</p>

<p><strong>Another Gaza?</strong></p>

<p>US President Joe Biden, whose country is Israel's main ally and weapons supplier, on Monday said Washington was "working to de-escalate in a way that allows people to return home safely".</p>

<p>Separately, Pentagon spokesman Major General Pat Ryder said the US was "sending a small number of additional US military personnel" to the region after thousands were deployed earlier alongside warships, fighter jets and air defence systems.</p>

<p>Ahead of the annual General Assembly in New York, UN chief Antonio Guterres warned of Lebanon becoming "another Gaza" and said it was "clear that both sides are not interested in a ceasefire" there.</p>

<p>Speaking at the General Assembly, Masoud Pezeshkian, the recently elected president of Iran -- which backs Hezbollah and Hamas -- accused Israel of seeking "to create this wider conflict".</p>

<p>The UNIFIL peacekeeping force in south Lebanon meanwhile warned that "any further escalation of this dangerous situation could have far-reaching and devastating consequences".</p>

<p>Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,205 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures that include hostages killed in captivity.</p>

<p>Of the 251 hostages also seized by militants, 97 are still held in Gaza, including 33 the Israeli military says are dead.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory military offensive has killed at least 41,455 people in Gaza, most of them civilians, according to figures provided by the Hamas-run territory's health ministry. The UN has described the figures as reliable.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The dead-celebrity industry has proved lucrative. Despite Michael Jackson being about $500 million in debt at the time of his death, his estate has amassed a fortune of $2 billion, according to People.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Can you think of a better way to get into the spirit of Halloween than listening to The Legend of Sleepy Hollow read by the ghost of James Dean?</p>

<p>The actor's career may have ended tragically in 1955, but his estate is keeping his paycheck alive through artificial intelligence. Alongside the estates of Judy Garland, Laurence Olivier and Burt Reynolds, it signed with AI voice-cloning startup ElevenLabs in July as part of the company's "iconic voices" project. The actors now narrate books, articles and other text material put into ElevenLabs' Reader app; essentially, Garland can now read you The Wonderful Wizard of Oz or your tax return-the choice is yours.</p>

<p>The dead-celebrity industry has proved lucrative. Despite Michael Jackson being about $500 million in debt at the time of his death, his estate has amassed a fortune of $2 billion, according to People, thanks to projects such as a jukebox musical and even featuring work made while he was alive. Yet advances in AI mean a late artist like Jackson can still generate new art.</p>

<p>Mark Roesler, an intellectual-property lawyer, has represented more than 3,000 celebrities, most of whom are dead, and has made some 30,000 deals on their behalf since founding his company CMG Worldwide Inc. more than four decades ago. Among current clients including Rosa Parks and Malcolm X, he's negotiated Jerry Garcia his own ElevenLabs deal.</p>

<p>There are two key ways a living celebrity makes money, Roesler says. The first is personal services, which, for a musician like Prince, would have been income from his concerts and songs. The second is intellectual property, which is independent of those services and could be anything from the copyright of music to pictures.</p>

<p>When a celebrity dies, their personal services revenue expires immediately, leaving to their estate just the intellectual-property revenue, which, Roesler found, used to decline on average by 10% annually, but now can rise. "I've been assisted by all the technological changes, like AI," he says. "With intellectual property, there are so many different uses of it."</p>

<p>For instance, Travis Cloyd, founder and chief executive officer of Worldwide XR (where Roesler is chairman), has cast Dean in the movie Return to Eden, currently in production. With dead celebrities, there are now two pathways for filmmakers, Cloyd says: "You could either hire an actor, or now, because of the technology, you can create a digital human of James Dean."</p>

<p>The latter process begins with a base of source material, so-called legacy assets that even include family videos. These are put through machine learning to create a digital model of the actor. From there, other elements are created by using body doubles for skin texture and movement, and vocals get layered on top.</p>

<p>It's similar to how Paul Walker (Furious 7) and Peter Cushing (Rogue One: A Star Wars Story) made their controversial CGI appearances almost a decade ago. A large role by Ian Holm, who died in 2020, in this summer's Alien: Romulusinflamed critics and did little to quell the ethical debate around AI, even though his widow, kids and estate signed off.</p>

<p>Hollywood is slowly getting on board after last year's actors' and writers' strikes brought the industry to a standstill over a number of issues, chief among them AI. In August, SAG-Aftra reached a deal allowing brands to replicate living actors' voices in AI audio ads on a job-by-job basis.</p>

<p>For dead ones, Cloyd says, enormous demand will dictate the terms. The potential for AI projects to become the main driver of income for celebrities' estates in the next five years is massive, he says: "With the rise of digital platforms, streaming services and virtual experiences, there are ample opportunities for celebrities to monetize their legacies in new and exciting ways."</p>

<p>Consider ABBA Voyage, which opened in London in May 2022 and has been making more than $2 million a week with concerts featuring de-aged, virtual-reality avatars of the Swedish pop stars. Although the foursome collaborated on the show and were all still alive as of press time, these CGI renderings could theoretically keep minting money for their estates long after their deaths.</p>

<p>Not everyone is convinced. Jeff Jampol, who manages "inactive artists" including Janis Joplin and the Doors, sees AI as a "nonstarter." He's turned down offers to replicate Jim Morrison's voice and casts the technology as a fad akin to nonfungible tokens, or NFTs. "There'll be something else next," he says, noting his decades in the industry seeing "waves come and go." But mostly, "I can't put anything in Jim Morrison's mouth that he didn't say ever. That would be a travesty."</p>

<p>Jampol compares handling the legacy of an artist to having six matches on a fireplace. Each venture they sign on to is like striking a match. "They hold it into the fireplace, and the fireplace glows, and then nine seconds later the match goes out. You're left with an empty, cold, dark fireplace and one burnt match. Just repeat that five times, and it's the end of a legacy for 25 years," he says. "How they lived, what they said and what they created is their legacy. I can't change that."</p>

<p>Svana Gisla, the Emmy- and Grammy-nominated co-producer behind ABBA Voyage, which didn't use AI in cloning the singers, thinks there's one key place the new technology falls short. "We will always be seeking that emotional connection that lies within that communication that art brings," she says, "and AI will never provide that communication or replace artistry in any form."</p>

<p>Perhaps the biggest test of AI will arrive next spring, when Elvis Evolution premieres at ExCeL London and sees the King of Rock 'n' Roll performing for the first time in more than 45 years. For the almost two-hour immersive biopic-think piped-in scents of earthy cotton fields and cranked-up humidity to evoke rural Mississippi-capturing the icon's stage presence in hologram form has been no easy task, says Andrew McGuinness, founder and CEO of Layered Reality, the show's producer.</p>

<p>"It's not a kind of fabrication or the work of a digital artist," he says. "It actually comes from his real-life performances, his real-life facial movements, his real-life voice structure," and it takes hundreds of hours of performance and home videos fed into AI software to create his digital double. Layered Reality had access to the full archive of his home-turned-museum Graceland.</p>

<p>"If you wish to, you can see what he had for lunch on a certain day 45 years ago," says McGuinness. Elvis' favorite dishes might even be available to fans in the bar that keeps the 1960s atmosphere going as they exit the show.</p>

<p>Will the infamous peanut butter, banana and bacon sandwich be on the menu? McGuinness won't say.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A couple, who bought Bochym Manor in Cornwall, England, were devastated to find the former owner gutted the property before leaving.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A couple's dream of owning a £1.5 million, approximately Rs 16.65 crore, mansion quickly turned into a nightmare when they found the previous owner stripped the property of its most valuable assets. Martin and Sarah Caton bought the home, Bochym Manor, in Cornwall, but were devastated to see it in ruins when they first moved in. They were eager to transform the estate into a wedding venue and holiday destination.</p>

<p>“I was distraught. It was like a warzone or like a tornado had shredded the place. He took pretty much every door handle, tiles off the wall, the locks were removed,” Mr Caton was quoted as saying by the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://metro.co.uk/2024/09/21/couple-buy-1-500-000-cornwall-mansion-worst-nightmare-comes-true-21588379/">Metro</a>.</p>

<p>The once-majestic property, steeped in history, featured a Jacobean oak staircase and a walnut-panelled library. The 10-bedroom gothic-revival villa had 13 vacation houses on the estate, as well as hidden tunnels and antique stained-glass windows.</p>

<p>It was found stripped of doors, windows, fireplaces, floors and even plumbing and electrics. The stained-glass windows and the library's original panelling — carved by the same artisans who worked on the Houses of Parliament — had also been removed. The Catons further revealed the holiday homes were left gutted, and the estate's clock tower staircase had been torn out.</p>

<p>“There was some very random and bizarre destruction. I don't understand the mentality behind it – it's staggering that you can be that cruel actually,” Mr Caton told Metro.</p>

<p>The couple, who bought the property in 2014, have had to spend an additional £1.5 million to restore the mansion and its surrounding properties. They immediately reported the destruction to the police and Cornwall Council, sparking a nine-year legal battle.</p>

<p>Sellers are prohibited from removing fixtures and fittings without the consent of buyers, especially when dealing with a listed property like Bochym Manor. Despite these regulations, the previous owner, Mark Payne, dismantled and removed several key elements of the historic estate.</p>

<p>According to Metro, in 2015, Payne was arrested on suspicion of theft, criminal damage, and violations of the Planning Act at his new home in Cumbria. Police recovered a few items, but the case stalled when Cornwall Council dropped it, citing concerns over proving Dr Payne had caused the damage. He was released without charge.</p>

<p>The Catons, using historic photographs of the property, provided evidence of what had been taken and presented it to the council again. External legal advice confirmed that there was enough evidence to pursue a case. However, the council declined to prosecute Payne, leaving the Catons baffled and frustrated.</p>

<p>After nearly a decade of legal wrangling, the Catons finally achieved a small victory earlier this year when the removed items were returned.</p>]]></content:encoded>

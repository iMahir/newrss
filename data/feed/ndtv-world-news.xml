       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump, touting plans on taxes and health, tried on Friday to turn the page on a week in which he was overshadowed by Kamala Harris and struggled to focus on policy issues instead of personal attacks on his opponent in the US presidential race.</p>

<p>From a lectern at a Mexican restaurant in Las Vegas, the Republican candidate spoke about his plan to eliminate taxes on tips to waiters and other service employees. He discussed his campaign's efforts to court Hispanic voters in Nevada, a battleground state that could help determine the Nov. 5 election, and nationwide.</p>

<p>The tax proposal, a pillar of Trump's economic agenda, is the kind of issue his advisers have been pressing him to focus on, rather than his frequent personal attacks against Vice President Kamala Harris' looks, Black and Indian heritage and intelligence, warning they could turn off the moderate voters he needs to win.</p>

<p>At an event in Arizona later, the former president repeated his tax pledge, while promising to set up a commission to investigate presidential assassination attempts. He also said he would install a panel to investigate "an increase in chronic health problems and childhood diseases."</p>

<p>Both proposals are apparent concessions to independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who endorsed Trump at the event after dropping out of the race.</p>

<p>Trump's comments come one day after Kamala Harris accepted the Democratic Party's presidential nomination with a muscular speech that laid down broad foreign policy principles and sharp contrasts with Trump with 11 weeks left until Election Day.</p>

<p>Trump sought to counter-program the four-day convention with events of his own around the country, hoping to steal some media attention from Kamala Harris. However, his speeches on foreign policy, the economy and crime did little to dislodge the spotlight from Kamala Harris and received little attention - a stunning turnabout for a politician used to dominating headlines.</p>

<p>The Republican and his aides hope Thursday's boisterous convention finale marks the end of the honeymoon period for Kamala Harris, who emerged as the Democratic candidate little more than a month ago, after President Joe Biden exited the race and endorsed her.</p>

<p>During Kamala Harris' acceptance speech in Chicago, Trump attacked her with dozens of posts on his Truth Social platform, calling her a liar, a Marxist and "Comrade Kamala Harris." One post simply asked: "IS SHE TALKING ABOUT ME?"</p>

<p>William Rosenberg, a political science professor at Drexel University, said Trump's personal attacks on Kamala Harris underscored his frustration with having to face a biracial woman, a task complicated by his history of making racist remarks.</p>

<p>"His anger and his words speak volumes," Rosenberg said. "He's navigating a path which is full of problems for him."</p>

<p>Kamala Harris has surged in the polls since entering the race, with polling aggregator website FiveThirtyEight putting her ahead of Trump in six of seven battleground states.</p>

<p>She is also outraising her Republican counterpart. Her campaign told the Federal Election Commission this week that it raised $204 million last month, compared to $48 million reported to the body by Trump's main fundraising group.</p>

<p>One question still to be answered is whether Kamala Harris will also outpace Trump on the trail in the coming weeks. Biden, 81, made relatively few campaign stops, easing pressure on Trump to travel more around the country. That may now change with Harris, 59.</p>

<p>Trump, 78, will travel to Detroit on Monday to address a conference of the National Guard Association of the United States and is scheduled to give a speech at a conservative women's group's annual summit in Washington on Friday.</p>

<p>Campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said Trump would hold at least one additional campaign stop between those two events, without providing details.</p>

<p>The Kamala Harris campaign has not yet released details of her movements for next week.</p>

<p>Leavitt blamed the media for focusing their stories on Trump's personal attacks, which she said made up a fraction of his otherwise policy-heavy rallies and speeches.</p>

<p>At a speech event on Wednesday in Asheboro, North Carolina, billed as one on national security, Trump said he had rejected the recommendations of his advisers to focus on policy, and he insulted Kamala Harris and other Democrats in personal terms.</p>

<p>He again recounted those conversations with advisers at the rally in Arizona on Friday.</p>

<p>"My geniuses, they get paid a fortune - actually not that much - but I call up my people, I say, 'They're knocking the hell out of me, and you say I shouldn't get personal. I have to get personal, don't I?'" Trump said to applause.</p>

<p>An outside adviser to Trump told Reuters on condition of anonymity that several advisers had told the former president that a continued focus on insults rather than policy could doom his chances in November.</p>

<p>Republican strategist Doug Heye said Trump could still win the race, which he predicted would be close, but to do that he should focus on inflation, illegal immigration and other issues that polling show many voters give him higher marks on.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>German police on Saturday arrested the suspected killer behind a knife rampage that left three people dead at a street festival, an attack claimed by the Islamic State group.</p>

<p>The unidentified assailant fled after striking in the western town of Solingen late on Friday, sparking a day-long manhunt.</p>

<p>"We have just arrested the true suspect," North Rhine-Westphalia region interior minister Herbert Reul said on public television late Saturday evening.</p>

<p>"The man we have been looking for all day has since a short time ago been in detention," he said, adding that police found evidence to convict him.</p>

<p>In a statement on Telegram, IS's Amaq propaganda arm said that "the perpetrator of the attack on a gathering of Christians in the city of Solingen in Germany yesterday was a soldier of the Islamic State".</p>

<p>IS said the attack was carried out as "revenge for Muslims in Palestine and everywhere", in an apparent reference to Israel's war with Palestinian group Hamas in the Gaza Strip.</p>

<p>The claim has yet to be verified. German officials had earlier said that "a terrorist motive cannot be excluded" for the act.</p>

<p>A police spokesman earlier told AFP that officers had arrested a man in a raid at a hostel for asylum seekers, not far from the scene of Friday's attack.</p>

<p>Earlier on Saturday, a prosecutor said a first person was arrested: a 15-year-old suspected of failing to report a criminal act.</p>

<p>Witnesses had allegedly seen the teen discussing the attack just before it happened with a man who could be the killer, said Markus Caspers, prosecutor of Duesseldorf, just west of Solingen.</p>

<p>The people killed were men of 56 and 67 years of age and a 56-year-old woman, officials said.</p>

<p>"The victims were completely unknown with no known ties between them," Caspers told a press conference.</p>

<p>Four of the wounded were in a "serious" condition, officials said, revising down an earlier estimate of five.</p>

<p>Chancellor Olaf Scholz said the perpetrator "must be caught quickly and punished".</p>

<p>The attacker struck as thousands of people gathered for the first night of a "Festival of Diversity", part of a series of events to mark Solingen's 650th anniversary.</p>

<p><strong>High terror alert</strong></p>

<p>Germany has been on high alert for possible Islamist attacks after a series of atrocities.</p>

<p>Since the outbreak of the war in Gaza on October 7, the risk of Islamist plots has "worsened considerably", Interior Minister Nancy Faeser said, warning that "the threat posed by Islamist terrorism remains high".</p>

<p>Jihadists have carried out several attacks in Germany in recent years, the deadliest being a truck rampage at a Berlin Christmas market in 2016 that killed 12.</p>

<p>A police officer was killed and five people were wounded in a knife attack at a far-right rally in the city of Mannheim in May, with an Islamist motive suspected.</p>

<p>Friday's killing started as thousands of people had gathered in front of a stage for the first night of the three-day festival.</p>

<p>Witness Lars Breitzke told the Solinger Tageblatt newspaper he was a few metres away from the attack, not far from the stage, and "understood from the expression on the singer's face that something was wrong".</p>

<p>"And then, a metre away from me, a person fell," said Breitzke, who at first thought it was someone who had had too much to drink.</p>

<p>When he turned around, he saw other people lying on the ground amid pools of blood.</p>

<p>Solingen mayor Tim-Oliver Kurzbach said the whole city was in "shock, horror and great grief".</p>

<p>Faeser called for the country to "remain united" as she denounced "those who want to stir up hatred" during a visit to the site of the tragedy. "Let us not be divided", she said.</p>

<p><strong>Series of knifings</strong></p>

<p>Solingen is a city of some 150,000 people located between Duesseldorf and Cologne.</p>

<p>Up to 75,000 visitors had been expected to attend the "Festival of Diversity".</p>

<p>After the attack, "people left the scene in shock, but calmly," Philipp Mueller, one of the organisers, told the newspaper, adding that the rest of the festival was cancelled.</p>

<p>Scholz's centre-left coalition faces regional elections next week in the east of the country, where the far-right AfD is leading strongly in the polls.</p>

<p>Germany took in more than a million asylum seekers in 2015-2016 at the height of Europe's migrant crisis.</p>

<p>The influx was deeply divisive in Germany and fuelled the popularity of the AfD.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>French police arrested Telegram chief executive Pavel Durov on Saturday at an airport near Paris for alleged offences related to the popular messaging app, officials said.</p>

<p>The Franco-Russian billionaire, 39, was detained at Le Bourget airport north of the French capital on Saturday evening, one of the officials told AFP, speaking on condition of anonymity.</p>

<p>He had just travelled from Baku, in Azerbaijan, another source close to the case said.</p>

<p>Durov was expected to appear in court on Sunday.</p>

<p>France's OFMIN, an agency tasked with preventing violence against minors, had issued an arrest warrant for Durov as the coordinating agency in a preliminary investigation into alleged offences including fraud, drug trafficking, cyberbullying, organised crime and promotion of terrorism, one of the sources close to the case said.</p>

<p>Durov is suspected of failing to take action to curb the criminal use of his platform.</p>

<p>"Enough of Telegram's impunity," said one of the investigators, adding they were surprised Durov came to Paris knowing he was a wanted man.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Israeli military announced on Saturday the deaths of three reserve soldiers killed in fighting in the Gaza Strip the previous day.</p>

<p>The soldiers, two sergeants first class and a sergeant major, were killed in central Gaza, the military said.</p>

<p>Two were killed in a bomb blast, while the third died in a gun battle when militants opened fire on a group of soldiers, military spokesman Daniel Hagari said in a televised briefing.</p>

<p>In recent weeks, Israeli forces have been engaged in fierce fighting with Palestinian operatives in central Gaza, particularly in the Deir el-Balah area.</p>

<p>The latest deaths bring the military's losses in the Gaza campaign to 338 since it launched a ground offensive in the Palestinian territory on October 27.</p>

<p>The war in Gaza erupted after Hamas-led operatives attacked Israel on October 7, which resulted in the deaths of 1,199 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures.</p>

<p>Hamas operatives also seized 251 people, 105 of whom are still captive in Gaza, including 34 the Israeli military says are dead.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory military campaign has killed at least 40,334 people in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry, which does not give details of civilian and militant deaths.</p>

<p>Most of the dead are women and children, according to the UN human rights office.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Negotiators geared up for a crucial weekend of Gaza ceasefire talks Saturday, as Hamas said it was sending delegates to Cairo but would not participate in the discussions, and fighting raged in the Palestinian territory.</p>

<p>The United States, Egypt and Qatar have spent months trying to broker an end to the war in Gaza between Hamas Palestinian militants and Israel.</p>

<p>The war, sparked by Hamas's unprecedented October 7 attack on Israel, has devastated Gaza, displaced nearly all of its population at least once and triggered a humanitarian crisis.</p>

<p>The White House said progress had been made at the latest round this week, although the possible permanent presence of Israeli troops along the Gaza-Egypt border has emerged as a major sticking point.</p>

<p>Previous bouts of optimism during months of on-off ceasefire and hostage release negotiations have always proven unfounded.</p>

<p>A senior Hamas official said a delegation from the Islamist group was heading to Cairo, but that they would not engage in the talks. Instead, they would meet with senior Egyptian officials for updates on the negotiations.</p>

<p>The delegation would "be briefed... but this does not mean it will take part in the negotiations", the official told AFP, speaking on condition of anonymity.</p>

<p>The official said Hamas would insist Israel withdraw all its forces from all of Gaza, including "from the border area with Egypt", known as the Philadelphi Corridor.</p>

<p><strong>'Pivotal step'</strong></p>

<p>The basis of the talks is a framework which US President Joe Biden outlined on May 31, and which he described as an Israeli proposal.</p>

<p>A second Hamas official on Saturday reiterated that "the leadership of Hamas, including its leader Yahya Sinwar" had already agreed to the Biden plan and want it put into effect without "amendment of its wording."</p>

<p>The three-phase plan outlined by Biden and endorsed by the UN Security Council would initially see hostages exchanged for Palestinians in Israeli jails during what Biden called a "full and complete ceasefire" lasting six weeks.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has since insisted on keeping troops along the corridor, arguing Israel needs to prevent Hamas from rebuilding its strength by smuggling in arms from Egypt.</p>

<p>The White House said CIA chief William Burns was among US officials taking part in the Cairo talks, alongside the heads of Israel's spy agency and domestic security service.</p>

<p>An Egyptian source close to the talks said the United States was "discussing with mediators new proposals to bridge the gap between Israel and Hamas".</p>

<p>The source said Sunday's "enlarged round of negotiations" would be a "pivotal step in formulating an agreement that will be announced if Washington can pressure Netanyahu."</p>

<p>Fighting raged in Gaza on Saturday, with AFP correspondents and civil defence rescue sources reporting ongoing Israeli artillery fire and air strikes across the Hamas-run territory.</p>

<p>An overnight strike on a house west of Khan Yunis in southern Gaza killed 11 people, including a woman and four children, a doctor at Nasser Hospital said.</p>

<p>In Gaza City's Zeitun neighbourhood, gunfire and explosions echoed as Palestinian militants clashed with Israeli soldiers, an AFP correspondent reported.</p>

<p>The military announced the deaths of three soldiers in fighting in central Gaza on Friday, all of them non-commissioned officers.</p>

<p>The latest deaths bring the military's losses in the Gaza campaign to 338 since it launched a ground offensive in the Palestinian territory on October 27.</p>

<p>Tens of thousands of civilians were on the move from Deir el-Balah and Khan Yunis after Israeli evacuation orders, which precede military operations, the United Nations said on Thursday.</p>

<p>"I have six children and every day I flee with them from one place to another," said Khan Yunis resident Raghda Sammour.</p>

<p><strong>Hostage protests</strong></p>

<p>Hamas's October 7 attack on southern Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,199 people, most of them civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory military campaign has killed 40,334 Palestinians in Gaza, according to Gaza's health ministry, which does not give details of civilian and militant deaths.</p>

<p>The UN rights office says most of the dead are women and children.</p>

<p>Palestinian militants also seized 251 hostages, of whom 105 remain in Gaza, including 34 the military says are dead.</p>

<p>Israel's military recovered the remains of six hostages from a tunnel in the Khan Yunis area this week, and said bullets were found in their bodies.</p>

<p>Thousands protested in Tel Aviv and other Israeli cities ahead of Sunday's talks, calling for a deal to secure the release of the remaining hostages.</p>

<p>Efforts to reach a Gaza truce and avert a wider war intensified after the killings of two senior Iran-backed militants last month sparked threats of reprisals from Tehran and its Lebanese ally Hezbollah.</p>

<p>Gazans said they were desperate for an end to the war.</p>

<p>"We are tired and hope that the negotiations persist, the siege is lifted, and the war stops," said Umm Muhammad Wadi, a displaced woman in Deir el-Balah.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Tuesday was poised to warn that life in Britain will "get worse" before it gets "better", in his first major speech since taking office.</p>

<p>Keir Starmer, whose Labour Party was elected by a landslide on July 4, is expected to use the speech to ramp up attacks on the legacy left by the ousted Conservatives.</p>

<p>His comments come after criticism that Labour is seeking a pretext to raise taxes, despite pre-election promises that certain taxes would not be hiked.</p>

<p>"We have inherited not just an economic black hole but a societal black hole. And that is why we have to take action and do things differently," Keir Starmer will say, according to excerpts of the speech released in advance.</p>

<p>"Part of that is being honest with people -- about the choices we face. And how tough this will be. Frankly -- things will get worse before we get better."</p>

<p>Finance minister Rachel Reeves in recent days warned of "difficult decisions" over whether to cut spending or increase taxes in her first budget on October 30.</p>

<p>Since Labour's election victory, Reeves has repeatedly accused the ex-prime minister Rishi Sunak's Tories of leaving a &amp;#163;22 billion ($29 billion) black hole in this year's budget.</p>

<p>But opponents say she would have been aware of the state of the country's finances months ago and is simply preparing the ground for unpopular announcements.</p>

<p>Keir Starmer is expected to tell the public that things are "worse than we ever imagined".</p>

<p>The same theme has been adopted by ministers across government since July 4.</p>

<p>Commentators, however, have warned that the electorate could quickly tire of Labour blaming the Tories if it does not make clear progress in fixing some challenges facing the nation.</p>

<p>Main election issues included long waiting times for treatment under the state-funded National Health Service (NHS), immigration and a cost-of-living crisis that has triggered widespread strikes even by emergency health care staff.</p>

<p>"In the first few weeks, we discovered a &amp;#163;22 billion black hole in the public finances. And don't let anyone say that this is performative, or playing politics," Keir Starmer will say.</p>

<p>"The OBR (Office for Budget Responsibility) did not know about this. They wrote a letter saying so. They didn't know -- because the last government hid it."</p>

<p>The prime minister will also address the recent riots sparked by a mass stabbing in which three young girls aged between six and nine-years-old attending a Taylor Swift themed dance class were killed.</p>

<p>He is expected to say that the rioters were able to exploit "the cracks in our society after 14 years of populism and failure", referring to the Conservatives' time in office.</p>

<p>Officials have blamed far-right elements for helping to stir up the disorder, which targeted mosques and hotels housing asylum-seekers as well as police officers and other properties.</p>

<p>The authorities have cited misinformation spread online that the suspect was a Muslim asylum-seeker for fuelling the violence.</p>

<p>Axel Rudakubana, who was aged 17 at the time, was actually born in Britain to parents who hail from Rwanda, an overwhelmingly Christian country.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan's cases in connection with the May 9 riots might go to military courts, the Pakistan government's spokesperson for legal affairs, Barrister Aqeel Malik, said.</p>

<p>Notably, countrywide protests erupted on May 9 last year after the paramilitary Rangers whisked away Imran from the Islamabad High Court (IHC) in a corruption case.</p>

<p>When the protests took place, social media was flooded with footage of rioting and vandalism at various spots, including the Lahore Corps Commander's residence and General Headquarters, the army's head of office in Rawalpindi.</p>

<p>The already incarcerated former prime minister was "arrested" in these cases on July 15 -- just a day after he and his wife, Bushra Bibi, had been apprehended in a new Toshakhana case, following their acquittal in the Iddat case, as reported by Dawn.</p>

<p>In an interview with DawnNewsTV, Barrister Aqeel Malik was questioned whether he thought the trial of Imran could be in a military court following the arrest of former intelligence chief Lt-Gen (retired) Faiz Hameed, to which he said, "Yes absolutely."</p>

<p>He said the events and vandalism seen on May 9 invited the application of the Army Act since military installations were attacked and damaged. Aqeel Malik further alleged that the PTI founder "orchestrated" and "properly operated" the riots that took place last year.</p>

<p>"This was premeditated. This was pre-planned," Aqeel Malik said.</p>

<p>He further said regarding military courts that "it is entirely possible that Imran Khan's trial is held in a military court and the reason for that is because the Army Act will be applicable."</p>

<p>Aqeel Malik said that a lot of people were saying that any conviction by a military could be appealed at the high court, but he added neither the high court nor the Supreme Court could entertain it.</p>

<p>"According to the legal provisions, the appeal for the case would be taken by the military court of appeals," Aqeel Malik further stated.</p>

<p>He added that once the options of appeals were exhausted, then only the mercy appeal could be submitted to the army chief or the president as a last resort.</p>

<p>Notably, Imran Khan previously claimed that there is a plan to try him in the military court. He claimed that Hameed was being forced to turn approver against him to pave the way for his trial in a military court on May 9 cases, as reported by Dawn.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NASA today picked Elon Musk's SpaceX to bring back Sunita Williams and Barry Wilmore from space next year. Eighty days ago, the two astronauts arrived at the International Space Station aboard Boeing's Starliner for an 8-day mission. They were forced to extend their stay because of major technical issues with the Boeing capsule.</p>

<p>The astronauts are expected to return in February next year, after spending a total of eight months in orbit, on a SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft due to launch next month as part of a routine astronaut rotation mission.</p>

<p>NASA chief Bill Nelson said Starliner's propulsion system is too risky to carry its first crew home. Starliner will undock from the ISS without a crew and attempt to return to Earth as it would have with astronauts aboard.</p>

<p>The space agency's decision to pick Boeing's top space rival marked a fresh setback to the Starliner test mission. Boeing had hoped the mission would redeem the troubled program after years of development problems and over $1.6 billion in budget overruns since 2016.</p>

<p>Nelson said he discussed the agency's decision with Boeing's new CEO Kelly Ortberg.</p>

<p>The SpaceX Crew-9 mission will take off in late September, but carrying only two passengers instead of the originally planned four.</p>

<p>It will remain moored to the ISS until its scheduled return in February, bringing back its own crew members plus their two stranded colleagues.</p>

<p>The veteran <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/astronauts-sunita-williams-barry-butch-wilmore-in-space-for-80-days-will-return-february-next-year-says-nasa-6410618">NASA astronauts</a>, both former military test pilots, became the first crew to ride Starliner on June 5 when they were launched to the ISS.</p>

<p>Starliner's propulsion system suffered multiple glitches beginning in the first 24 hours of its flight to the ISS, triggering months of cascading delays. Five of its 28 thrusters failed and it sprang several leaks of helium, which is used to pressurise the thrusters.</p>

<p>Since Starliner docked to the ISS in June, Boeing has scrambled to investigate what caused its thruster mishaps and helium leaks. The company arranged tests and simulations on Earth to gather data that it has used to try and convince NASA officials that Starliner is safe to fly the crew back home.</p>

<p>But results from that testing raised more difficult engineering questions and ultimately failed to quell NASA officials' concerns about Starliner's ability to make its crewed return trip - the most daunting and complex part of the test mission.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President Volodymyr Zelensky touted a newly developed Ukrainian "drone missile" on Saturday that he said would take the war back to Russia and scornfully derided Russia's Vladimir Putin as a "sick old man from Red Square".</p>

<p>As Ukraine marked 33 years of post-Soviet independence, Mr Zelensky said the new weapon, Palianytsia, was faster and more powerful than the domestically made drones that Kyiv has so far used to fight back against Russia, striking its oil refineries and military airfields.</p>

<p>"Our enemy will ... know what the Ukrainian way for retaliation is. Worthy, symmetrical, long-ranged," he said.</p>

<p>Mr Zelensky said the new class of Ukrainian weapon had been used for a successful strike on a target in Russia, but did not say where.</p>

<p>He used derisive language to describe Russia's 71-year-old president and the nuclear rhetoric coming out of Moscow.</p>

<p>"A sick old man from Red Square who constantly threatens everyone with the red button will not dictate any of his red lines to us," he said in a video on the Telegram messaging app.</p>

<p>Russia, which has attacked Ukraine with many thousands of missiles and drones since it invaded in February 2022, has decried Ukraine's drone attacks as terrorism. Moscow's troops are advancing in Ukraine's east and occupy 18% of the country.</p>

<p>Mr Zelensky has been pressing Kyiv's allies to allow him to use Western weapons deeper in Russian territory such as to strike airbases used by Russian warplanes that pound Ukraine with missiles and glide bombs.</p>

<p>"I want to stress once more that our new weapon decisions, including Palianytsia, is our realistic way to act while some of our partners are unfortunately delaying decisions," Mr Zelensky told a news conference.</p>

<p>Ukrainians say the word "Palianytsia", a type of Ukrainian bread, is too difficult to pronounce for Russians and it has been used - sometimes humorously - during the war as a way to tell Ukrainians and Russians apart.</p>

<p>"It will be very difficult for Russia, difficult to even pronounce what exactly has hit it," Mr Zelensky said of the drone missile.</p>

<h3><strong>TOP COMMANDER PROMOTED</strong></h3>

<p>In a decree, Mr Zelensky promoted his top commander, Colonel General Oleksandr Syrskyi, to the rank of general, a tacit gesture of praise after Ukraine's lightning cross-border incursion into Russia's Kursk region launched on Aug. 6.</p>

<p>Cast by Russia as an escalation and major provocation, Ukraine's incursion has captured more than 90 settlements in the Kursk region according to Kyiv, the biggest invasion of Russia since World War Two.</p>

<p>Speaking at a joint news conference with Poland's and Lithuania's leaders, Mr Zelensky told reporters the operation had in part been a preventive move to stop Russian plans to capture the northern city of Sumy.</p>

<p>Apart from capturing prisoners of war and creating a "buffer zone", Mr Zelensky said the operation had other objectives that he could not disclose publicly.</p>

<p>Independence Day has surged in importance for Ukrainians during the invasion, which has spurred widespread patriotic sentiment.</p>

<p>This year the public holiday took place after the US and German embassies issued warnings of a heightened risk of Russian missile and drone attacks across the country.</p>

<p>There had been no major strikes as of 1800 local time, but the air raid siren sounded in Kyiv late afternoon.</p>

<p>To mark the date, Mr Zelensky ratified the Rome Statute, paving the way for Ukraine to join the International Criminal Court, one of many steps needed to join the European Union, accession to which Kyiv sees as a priority.</p>

<p>He also signed legislation banning the activities of religious groups linked to Russia, creating a legal instrument for the government to ban a branch of the Orthodox Church seen as linked to Russia.</p>

<p>Ukraine and Russia also said they had each secured the release of 115 prisoners of war in an exchange. The Russian Defence Ministry said its freed servicemen had been captured during Ukraine's attack in the Kursk region.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two NASA astronauts who flew to the International Space Station in June aboard Boeing's faulty Starliner capsule will need to return to Earth on a SpaceX vehicle early next year, NASA said on Saturday, deeming issues with Starliner's propulsion system too risky to carry its first crew home.</p>

<p>The agency's decision, tapping Boeing's top space rival to return the astronauts, is one of NASA's most consequential in years. Boeing had hoped the test mission would redeem the Starliner program after years of development problems and over $1.6 billion in budget overruns since 2016.</p>

<p>Boeing is also struggling with quality issues on production of commercial planes, its most important products.</p>

<p>Veteran NASA astronauts <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/astronaut-sunita-williams-may-have-to-wait-months-in-space-what-nasa-is-planning-now-5994474">Butch Wilmore and Sunita Williams</a>, both former military test pilots, became the first crew to ride Starliner on June 5 when they were launched to the ISS for what was expected to be an eight-day test mission.</p>

<p>But<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/sunita-williams-barry-wilmore-boeing-starliner-why-nasa-picked-elon-musks-spacex-to-bring-back-astronauts-from-space-6410789"> Starliner's propulsion system suffered a series of glitches</a> beginning in the first 24 hours of its flight to the ISS, triggering months of cascading delays. Five of its 28 thrusters failed and it sprang several leaks of helium, which is used to pressurize the thrusters.</p>

<p>In a rare reshuffling of <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/sunita-williams-80-days-in-space-why-she-has-not-returned-to-earth-6409042">NASA's astronaut operations</a>, the two astronauts are now expected to return in February 2025 on a SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft due to launch next month as part of a routine astronaut rotation mission. Two of the Crew Dragon's four astronaut seats will be kept empty for Wilmore and Williams.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Starliner will undock from the ISS without a crew and attempt to return to Earth as it would have with astronauts aboard.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Boeing struggled for years to develop Starliner, a gumdrop-shaped capsule designed to compete with Crew Dragon as a second U.S. option for sending astronaut crews to and from Earth's orbit.</p>

<p>Starliner failed a 2019 test to launch to the ISS uncrewed, but mostly succeeded in a 2022 do-over attempt where it also encountered thruster problems. Its June mission with its first crew was required before NASA can certify the capsule for routine flights, but now Starliner's crew certification path has been upended.</p>

<p>Since Starliner docked to the ISS in June, Boeing has scrambled to investigate what caused its thruster mishaps and helium leaks. The company arranged tests and simulations on Earth to gather data that it has used to try and convince NASA officials that Starliner is safe to fly the crew back home.</p>

<p>But results from that testing raised more difficult engineering questions and ultimately failed to quell NASA officials' concerns about Starliner's ability to make its crewed return trip - the most daunting and complex part of the test mission.</p>

<p>NASA's decision, and Starliner's now-uncertain path to certification, will add to the crises faced by new Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg, who started this month with the goal to rebuild the planemaker's reputation after a door panel dramatically blew off a 737 MAX passenger jet in midair in January.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hundreds of migrants from India, Nepal and Vietnam have been stuck in Sao Paulo's international airport for weeks in alarming conditions, sleeping on the floor as they wait to enter Brazil, according to the Public Defender's Office and documents seen by Reuters on Friday.</p>

<p>A spokesman for the office said a 39-year-old migrant from Ghana died two weeks ago of unknown causes. It was not clear whether he died while retained at the airport or on the way to hospital.</p>

<p>At least 666 migrants without visas were waiting to enter Brazil at Guarulhos airport, the official said, with the added uncertainty that the government plans to tighten entry rules on Monday to stem a flow of foreigners using Brazil as a stopover to get to the United States and Canada.</p>

<p>The migrants are held in a restricted area where there is no access to a shower and their movements are limited, making it hard for them to obtain food and water, while children and adolescents are enduring winter cold with no blankets, the official said.</p>

<p>The Public Defender's Office found that the migrants' human rights were being violated with their health deteriorating.</p>

<p>The agency said conditions for the migrants need to be urgently improved while their status is being resolved, and urged authorities in a statement to comply with Brazil's legislation based on the humanitarian principle of accepting refugees and not returning them to their country of origin.</p>

<p>Starting on Monday, foreign travellers without a Brazilian visa who are headed for another country must travel straight on to their destination or return to their home country, Brazil's public security ministry told Reuters on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Brazil has seen a boom in foreign travellers, particularly from Asia, landing in the country for a supposed layover en route to North America, the ministry said in statement.</p>

<p>To enter Brazil, they ask for refugee status, alleging persecution and threats in their home countries, but a majority travel north when they can, according to two reports from authorities seen by Reuters and a senior police source.</p>

<p>Now, those passengers arriving in Sao Paulo without a visa will not be allowed to stay in Brazil, the ministry said.</p>

<p>It was not clear whether the new rules will apply to migrants already at the Sao Paulo airport or apply only to those arriving after the rules go into effect.</p>

<p>Immigration experts are concerned that the proposed rules counter the 1951 UN Refugee Convention, to which Brazil is a party and which calls on countries to take in those at risk in their home country, even if they are undocumented.</p>

<p>The head of Brazil's refugee committee, Jean Uema, told Reuters the rules would apply specifically to Sao Paulo airport and there would be no change to Brazil's policy on asylum seekers.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dozens of young singles gathered this week to meet potential marriage partners in Pakistan's eastern city of Lahore, the first attempt by a UK-based matrimonial app to help people find spouses in person in the conservative Islamic country.</p>

<p>Typically, marriages in Pakistan are arranged by parents who look for suitable matches for their children from within their communities or the extended family. Dating apps are generally stigmatised and gender segregation socially and at work remains common in the country of 240 million people.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Lahore event was organised by Muzz, formerly Muzzmatch, which says its app is based on Islamic etiquette. The app is restricted to Muslim users, and, in a nod to traditional values, gives the option of blurring pictures except for specific matches and allows for chaperones to oversee meetings.</p>

<p>Other smaller events are also emerging in the country to challenge traditional matchmaking norms.</p>

<p>Despite criticism online in the past for the app, the Muzz event was attended by about 100 people.</p>

<p>Aimen, a 31-year-old woman who did not want to be further identified, said she used the app on the recommendation of her U.S.-based brother.</p>

<p>"I used the app for two weeks, but then I saw an ad for this event and thought, why not meet people in person?" she told Reuters.</p>

<p>She said that her mother would have accompanied her as a chaperone but couldn't attend because of ill-health.</p>

<p>Muzz, launched in 2015 in the Britain, which also has a sizeable Muslim population, has over 1.5 million users in Pakistan, its second-largest market after Morocco.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Moaz, a 27-year-old man, said he has been using Muzz for a year and that he was hopeful of finding a wife through the app.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I do get matches, but they have different priorities," he said adding that girls on the app expect him to involve his parents from the beginning.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"That is not (immediately) possible," he said, stressing the need of getting to know someone before taking the next big step.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Annie's Matchmaking Party, another Lahore event last week, used an algorithm to match 20 young professionals after a selection process and invited them to the meet.</p>

<p>Noor ul Ain Choudhary, the 30-year-old organizer, faced criticism online that her event promoted a "hookup culture". She countered that it aimed to provide a safe space for singles to meet and connect.</p>

<p>"In Pakistan, we've had two options: biased arranged marriages or time-consuming dating apps with no guarantees. Safety during meetings is also a concern," she said.</p>

<p>Abdullah Ahmed, 22, was bullish about in person events and said he was convinced he may have found his perfect match at the Muzz gathering.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The highlight was meeting an amazing girl," he said, beaming with excitement, adding that they instantly clicked and swapped social media handles.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We're both Marvel fans! We're already planning to catch the new Deadpool &amp; Wolverine together," he said.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Conservationists said Saturday that they plan to bomb a remote South African island with tonnes of pesticide-laced pellets to kill mice that are eating albatrosses and other seabirds alive.</p>

<p>Hordes of mice are devouring the eggs of some of the world's most important seabirds that nest on Marion Island, about 2,000 kilometres (1,240 miles) southeast of Cape Town, and have started eating live birds, leading conservationist Mark Anderson said.</p>

<p>This includes the iconic Wandering Albatross, with a quarter of the world's population nesting on the Indian Ocean island.</p>

<p>"The mice have now, for the first time last year, been found to be feeding on adult Wandering Albatrosses," Anderson told a meeting of BirdLife South Africa, the country's leading bird conservation organisation.</p>

<p>Gruesome images presented at the meeting showed bloodied birds, some with flesh chewed off their heads.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Of the 29 species of seabirds that breed on the island, 19 are threatened with local extinction, the Mouse-Free Marion Project said. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Mouse attacks have escalated in recent years but the birds do not know how to respond because they evolved without terrestrial predators, said Anderson, a leader of the project and CEO of BirdLife South Africa.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Mice just climb onto them and just slowly eat them until they succumb," he told AFP. It can take days for a bird to die. "We are losing hundreds of thousands of seabirds every year through the mice."&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Extreme conditions</strong></h3>

<p>Billed as one of the world's most important bird conservation efforts, the Mouse-Free Marion Project has raised about a quarter of the $29 million it needs to send a squad of helicopters to drop 600 tonnes of rodenticide-laced pellets onto the rugged island.</p>

<p>It wants to strike in 2027 in winter, when the mice are most hungry and the summer-breeding birds are largely absent.</p>

<p>The pilots will have to fly in extreme conditions and reach every part of the island, which is about 25 kilometres long and 17 kilometres wide.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We have to get rid of every last mouse," Anderson said. "If there was a male and female remaining, they could breed and eventually get back to where we are now."</p>

<p>The mice are proliferating because warmer temperatures due to climate change means they are breeding more frequently over a longer period, Anderson said. After eating through plants and invertebrates, the mice turned to the birds.</p>

<p>House mice were introduced to the island in the early 1800s. Five cats were brought in around 1948 to control their numbers. But the cat numbers grew to about 2,000 and they were killing about 450,000 birds a year. An eradication project removed the last cat in 1991.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Beekeepers across France say it has been a disastrous year for honey, with bees starving to death and production plummeting by up to 80 percent.</p>

<p>Mickael Isambert, a beekeeper in Saint-Ours-les-Roches in central France, lost 70 percent of his honey and had to feed his colonies sugar to help them survive after a cold, rainy spring.</p>

<p>"It has been a catastrophic year," said Isambert, 44, who looks after 450 hives.</p>

<p>A beehive typically produces 15 kilos (33 pounds) of honey a year, but this time, Isambert said his farm had only produced between five and seven kilos.</p>

<p>When it rains, bees "don't fly, they don't go out, so they eat their own honey reserves," said his co-manager and fellow beekeeper Marie Mior.</p>

<p>Low temperatures and heavy rainfall have prevented bees from gathering enough pollen, and flowers from producing nectar -- which the insects collect to make honey.</p>

<h3><strong>'Some died of hunger'</strong></h3>

<p>Bad weather has affected honey producers countrywide, with spring production dropping by 80 percent in some regions -- figures that summer harvests will struggle to offset, said the French national beekeeping union (Unaf).</p>

<p>Rainfall rose by 45 percent on the yearly average, Unaf said in a letter to its local branches.</p>

<p>"With weather conditions that have been catastrophic in many regions with abundant rain... and low temperatures until late, many beekeepers' viability is under threat," said Unaf.</p>

<p>Temperatures stagnated below 18 degrees Celsius (64 Fahrenheit), the minimum temperature needed for flowers to produce nectar, said Jean-Luc Hascoet, a beekeeper in Brittany in western France who lost about 15 colonies.</p>

<p>"For some of my colleagues it was worse," he said.</p>

<p>"In June, the bee population increases and the needs of the colonies grow but as nothing was coming in, some died of hunger," said Hascoet.</p>

<h3><strong>'Black year'</strong></h3>

<p>French beekeepers had already been reeling from dealing with several seasons of scorching heat and delayed frosts, according to Unaf president Christian Pons, making this "black year" even worse.</p>

<p>"Ten years ago, I made one and a half to two tons of honey per site, compared to 100 kilos today," said Pons, a beekeeper in the southern Herault region.</p>

<p>Honeymakers earlier this year protested against "unfair competition" by foreign producers, which led to the government releasing five million euros ($5.6 million) in aid.</p>

<p>French consumers eat on average 45,000 tons of honey per year, about 20,000 tons of which is produced in France, according to the left-wing Peasants Confederation union.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In June 2024, when the Boeing Starliner spacecraft carried NASA astronauts Sunita Williams and Barry Wilmore to space, it was going to be a short eight-day mission. However, it's been 80 days since the launch and the two astronauts are yet to return.<br />
<br />
Launched on June 5, the test flight landed on the International Space Station (ISS) on June 6. Ms Williams and Mr Wilmore are still stuck in space, while the date of their return journey remains undecided. Some technical problems with the Boeing Starliner have left NASA unable to move on with their plans.</p>

<p><strong>What is the mission?</strong></p>

<p>The purpose of the<a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/when-will-sunita-williams-come-back-to-earth-nasa-shares-big-update-6399519"> Boeing Starliner mission was to demonstrate the spacecraft's capability to safely carry people to and from the ISS. </a>As part of NASA's Commercial Crew Program, Boeing, the aerospace company, views this trip as critical to its goal of joining Elon Musk's SpaceX in offering regular crew transportation services to the space agency.<br />
<br />
<strong>Why is the Boeing Starliner still stuck in space?</strong></p>

<p>Helium leaks: The spacecraft's service module reported several tiny helium leaks making it unsafe for travel. Helium is essential to preserving the spacecraft's structural integrity and manoeuvrability.</p>

<p>Thruster problems: The propulsion system of the spaceship experienced malfunctions with five of its thrusters. These components are essential for space travel and docking.<br />
<br />
Valve issues:&nbsp;Multiple issues with a valve responsible for regulating the flow of oxidizers were detected. The valve is essential for propulsion.<br />
<br />
<strong>What is NASA doing?&nbsp;</strong><br />
<br />
<a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/nasas-latest-update-on-sunita-williams-barry-wilmore-return-from-space-when-and-where-to-watch-6407915">NASA</a> and Boeing engineers are attempting to resolve the issues with the spacecraft. They are examining data from the spacecraft's propulsion system and are testing the spacecraft thrusters. Several scenarios are being explored using simulators stationed on the ground to find and address the problems.<br />
<br />
NASA will hold a press conference later on Saturday to update the world on when the two astronauts may return to Earth.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said on Friday he would suspend his campaign, and endorsed Republican Donald Trump, likely ending a presidential bid that he began as a Democrat trading on one of the most famous names in American politics.</p>

<p>His campaign indicated that he feared staying in the race would siphon support from former President Trump, who is locked in a tight contest with Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris ahead of the Nov. 5 election.</p>

<p>An environmental lawyer, anti-vaccine activist and son and nephew of two titans of Democratic politics who were assassinated during the turbulent 1960s, Kennedy entered the race in April 2023 as a challenger to President Joe Biden for the Democratic nomination.</p>

<p>With voters at the time turned off by both the aging Biden and the legally embattled Trump, interest in Kennedy soared. He shifted his plans and decided to run as an independent, and a November 2023 Reuters/Ipsos poll showed Kennedy drawing the support of 20% of Americans in a three-way race with Biden and Trump.</p>

<p>He ran a high-profile advertisement during the February 2024 Super Bowl that invoked his father, US Senator Robert F. Kennedy, and uncle, US President John F. Kennedy, and drew outrage from much of his high-profile family, who condemned his campaign.</p>

<p>For a time, both the Biden and Trump campaigns showed signs they were worried that Kennedy could draw enough support to change the election outcome. He faced an uphill battle in winning spots on the ballot as an independent but secured key positions including in Georgia, Michigan, Minnesota and North Carolina -- half of the competitive swing states expected to determine the election's outcome.</p>

<p>But as the race changed quickly in the last two months -- with Trump surviving an assassination attempt and the 81-year-old Biden bowing to pressure from his own party and passing the campaign torch to Harris -- voter interest in Kennedy, 70, waned.&nbsp;</p>

<p>An Ipsos poll early this month showed his national support had fallen to 4%, a tiny number, but one that could still be meaningful in a tight race such as the current Trump-Harris matchup.</p>

<p>His campaign had signaled over the past few days that a change was coming, as Kennedy set his Phoenix address. His running mate Nicole Shanahan said in an interview earlier that if the pair stayed in the race as independents, they could ultimate boost Harris' chances.</p>

<p>In exchange for endorsing Trump, Kennedy was hoping for a job in a potential Trump administration, a super PAC supporting Kennedy told Reuters on Wednesday. He also wanted Trump to allow his political movement to continue in some fashion, which could include staying on the ballot in some states.</p>

<p>Kennedy painted himself as a political outsider. He told Reuters in an interview in March that if elected president he would not restrict abortion, would repeal many provisions of Biden's signature Inflation Reduction Act and would seek to close down the southern border to immigrants entering the US illegally. He also offered staunch support for Israel.</p>

<p>Trump mega-donor Timothy Mellon, an 82-year-old banking heir, has given millions of dollars this election cycle in support of Kennedy, and given $75 million in support of Trump, according to Federal Election Commission filings through July 31.</p>

<p>Shanahan has donated over $15 million to the Kennedy campaign, FEC filings showed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a video of a phone call posted online last month, Trump suggested to Kennedy that the independent candidate could do something to support the Trump campaign. Soon after, both candidates spoke a day apart from each other at a bitcoin conference in Nashville, trying to court votes.</p>

<p><strong>BEAR, BRAIN WORMS &nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Kennedy said this month in a video posted online that he dumped a dead bear in New York City's Central Park a decade ago and staged it to look like a bike had hit it. He proclaimed he had "so many skeletons in my closet" after a former family babysitter accused him of sexual assault. He denied that a picture of him posing with the barbecued carcass of a large animal belonged to a canine.</p>

<p>And then there was the brain worm. Kennedy had a parasite in his brain more than a decade ago, but has since fully recovered, a fact unearthed by the New York Times and confirmed by the campaign.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Those stories prompted ridicule from late-night talk show hosts.</p>

<p>The Democratic Party especially has been ruthless in their opposition to Kennedy's candidacy including waging legal challenges against his ballot access, as concern grew that Kennedy could hurt the party's chances in November.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[After two arson attacks at a Starbucks construction site in Taos, New Mexico, a developer is trying again to build the chain's first drive-through cafe in the mountain town with a history of revolts and opposition by some to national chains.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After two arson attacks at a Starbucks construction site in Taos, New Mexico, a developer is trying again to build the chain's first drive-through cafe in the mountain town with a history of revolts and opposition by some to national chains. &nbsp;</p>

<p>It did not take long for locals in this community of 6,500 to come up with a nickname for the would-be coffee shop: "Charbucks." Meanwhile, the building contractor from Albuquerque, the state's largest city, has installed video cameras and a security guard sleeps at the site in a camouflage trailer.</p>

<p>Just over a mile north of the site of the store, which Starbucks hopes to open in the spring of 2025, patrons at one of Taos' oldest independent coffee shops are tight-lipped about the attacks.</p>

<p>"We don't know who did it, but we loved it," said Todd Lazar, a holistic healer, as he chatted with other regulars on a bench outside the World Cup, just off Taos' central plaza.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Their conversation echoes criticism Starbucks faced as it moved into Europe and Asia that the US coffee chain clashes with local culture and will shovel money out of communities. Starbucks operates or licenses around 39,500 cafes worldwide.</p>

<p>Stickers plastered on locally owned businesses show the Starbucks logo - which features a mermaid - on fire, with the mermaid's face replaced by La Calavera Catrina, a skull character associated with Mexico's Day of the Dead and that country's national identity.</p>

<p>After the first fire in August 2023, the word "NO" preceded by an expletive was spray-painted on the partially burned structure intended to be a Starbucks.</p>

<p>From the 1680 Indigenous Pueblo Revolt against Spanish settlement, to the 1847 Taos Revolt against US occupation and more recently an arson attack on a development tycoon and opposition to a billionaire's ski resort development, Taos locals have resisted outside forces.</p>

<p>"Taos is a dynamic and volatile contact zone between different groups, imperial powers, ecotones," said Sylvia Rodriguez, emerita professor of anthropology at the University of New Mexico who has conducted research on her home town of Taos for decades.</p>

<p>Located 7,000 feet (2,134 meters) above sea level in northern New Mexico's high mountain desert, Taos is known for its UNESCO World Heritage Site Native American settlement, art scene and steep ski runs.</p>

<p>The area also has deep social inequalities and disconnect between Indigenous, Hispano - descendants of colonial settlers - and other communities, with New Mexico's highest property crime rate.&nbsp;</p>

<p>People like Lazar complain that a wave of remote workers during and after the pandemic are driving demand for national chains and exacerbating housing shortages common in US West resort towns.</p>

<p>Taos' town council supported the store on grounds it would provide employment and tax revenue, according to Christopher Larsen, the town's economic development director</p>

<p><strong>"NOT COOL"</strong></p>

<p>World Cup owner Andrea Meyer said jobs were not the problem.</p>

<p>"People are showing up saying 'I'd love to work here, I can't afford to live here,'" said Meyer, who runs a cash-only cafe with no Wi-Fi so as to encourage patrons to talk to one other. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>Few working households can afford Taos' average home price of $460,000. Around a third of housing units sit vacant, some as second homes and vacation dwellings, others after traditional Hispano families left the area, or other factors, according to census data. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Two or three national chains pulled out of Taos projects after Starbucks burned a second time on Oct. 23, 2023, according to Larsen.</p>

<p>"The feeling is that Taos doesn't want corporate America," he said.</p>

<p>Starbucks spokesman Sam Jefferies said employee safety was its top priority and it would work closely with police once the store opened. No one has been injured in the fires.</p>

<p>The town has licensed Starbucks outlets in two supermarkets. Jefferies said the performance of cafes in nearby towns was a factor in opening a Taos store. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Based on news reports over the last three decades, Taos appears to be the only place in the world where a future Starbucks cafe has been burned to the ground.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Neither contractor Hart Construction nor Arizona-based developer and building owner Clint Jameson responded to requests for comment. On his company website, Jameson, who plans to lease the property to Starbucks, describes himself as "relentless" and a "development maverick."</p>

<p>The town and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) have offered a $30,000 reward for information on the fires. Police believe they know the culprit, or culprits, but lack evidence to place them at the site during the blazes, Larsen said. Taos Police Chief John Wentz declined to comment. ATF spokesman Cody Monday said the agency continued following leads and searching for the suspect or suspects.</p>

<p>At the Coffee Apothecary a mile south of the town's central plaza, owner Pablo Flores vouched for demand for Starbucks-like drinks such as iced caramel frappes, which he tells disappointed customers he does not serve.</p>

<p>The specialty coffee roaster lamented the cookie-cutter sameness of national chains sprouting south of town but abhorred their destruction. He saw the fires as an example of how dialogue has broken down amid political polarization across the country.</p>

<p>"Taos is changing and if you don't like the way it's changing, do not support that business," said Flores, whose family has lived in Taos for generations. "Don't burn it down, that's not cool."&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russia and Ukraine announced Saturday they had exchanged 115 prisoners of war each, just over two weeks after Kyiv launched a surprise incursion into Russia's Kursk region.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The exchange came as Kyiv mounts its offensive in Kursk and as Russia eyes more east Ukrainian towns. It also came on Ukrainian Independence Day.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Both countries thanked the United Arab Emirates, who said it mediated the swap deal.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Another 115 of our defenders have returned home today. These are soldiers of the National Guard, the Armed Forces, the Navy, the State Border Guard Service," Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He published photographs of men wrapped in Ukrainian flags.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Kyiv had said it had taken hundreds of Russian soldiers captive in its Kursk incursion launched on August 6.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Moscow confirmed the exchange and said it had returned 115 soldiers taken captive in Kursk:&nbsp;</p>

<p>"As a result of a negotiation process, 115 Russian servicemen taken prisoner in the Kursk region have been returned from territories controlled by the Kyiv regime," the Russian defence ministry said. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The ministry said the troops were currently in neighbouring Belarus, where they are receiving "psychological-medical help" and will be brought to Russia soon.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It released images of the men near busses in a field.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The United Arab Emirates said it had "successfully mediated a new captives exchange between the Russian Federation and the republic of Ukraine."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Kyiv and Moscow have held rounds of prisoner exchanges throughout the more than two-year war.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>German police on Saturday stepped up a major hunt for a man who stabbed three people to death and wounded eight others at a street festival in the city of Solingen, authorities said.</p>

<p>Police closed off the centre of Solingen after the attack on Friday night at the city's "Festival of Diversity". A police statement said five of the wounded were in "serious" condition.</p>

<p>Special forces were helping security personnel in the city centre while a helicopter flew overhead, according to an AFP journalist.</p>

<p>"Our security authorities are doing everything they can to catch the perpetrator" of the "horrific act", Interior Minister Nancy Faeser said, with Chancellor Olaf Scholz saying he "must be caught quickly and punished".</p>

<p>Thousands of people had gathered in front of a stage on the first night of the "Festival of Diversity", part of a series of events to mark Solingen's 650th anniversary, when the killing started.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"An unidentified man attacked several people with a knife around 9.40 pm (1940 GMT)," said the statement released by police in the nearby city of Duesseldorf.</p>

<p>"Police are currently searching for the perpetrator with a large contingent," it added, encouraging witnesses to send them photos, videos and any other information about the attack.</p>

<p><strong>'A person fell'</strong></p>

<p>"Out of nowhere, a man armed with a knife stabbed people at random and killed them," regional interior minister Herbert Reul said in comments at the scene.</p>

<p>"Why? Nobody knows. We cannot say anything yet about the motive," he added.</p>

<p>Witness Lars Breitzke told the Solinger Tageblatt newspaper he was a few metres from the attack, not far from the festival stage, and "understood from the expression on the singer's face that something was wrong".</p>

<p>"And then, a metre away from me, a person fell," said Breitzke, who at first thought it was someone who had too much to drink.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When he turned around, he saw other people lying on the ground amid pools of blood.</p>

<p>In a statement, Solingen mayor Tim-Oliver Kurzbach said the whole city was in "shock, horror and great grief".</p>

<p>"We all wanted to celebrate our town's anniversary together and now we have to mourn the dead and injured," he said.</p>

<p><strong>'Brutal and senseless'&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>"It tears my heart apart that there was an attack on our city. I have tears in my eyes when I think of those we have lost. I pray for all those who are still fighting for their lives," he said.</p>

<p>Hendrik Wuest, the premier of North Rhine-Westphalia state, also expressed his "shock and grief" in a post on social media platform X.</p>

<p>"An act of the most brutal and senseless violence has struck at the heart of our state," he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The whole of North Rhine-Westphalia stands by the people of Solingen, especially the victims and their families."</p>

<p>Solingen is a city of some 150,000 people located between Duesseldorf and Cologne.</p>

<p>People had gathered in the town on Friday evening for the first day of the three-day "Festival of Diversity".</p>

<p>It was set to feature music, street theatre, variety shows and comedians in the city centre and several other areas, it said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Up to 75,000 visitors had been expected to attend.</p>

<p><strong>Festival cancelled&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>The Solinger Tageblatt said one of the festival organisers went on stage to announce it was cancelled.</p>

<p>Thousands of people cleared the area, the paper reported, with a journalist at the scene describing the atmosphere as "ghostly".</p>

<p>"People left the scene in shock, but calmly," Philipp Mueller, one of the organisers, told the newspaper.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mueller said the rest of the festival would also be cancelled.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Protesters including Swedish activist Greta Thunberg and members of Extinction Rebellion on Saturday tried to blockade of a gas and oil processing plant in southwest Norway.</p>

<p>In a post to social media, Extinction Rebellion Norway said eight kayaks and three motorboats had entered a security zone outside the Karsto processing plant to "prevent the normal operation of tankers."</p>

<p>Activists, including Thunberg, also gathered on land to block the facility's gates.</p>

<p>"We cannot stand idly by as the fossil fuel industry robs people of their lives and destabilises our life support systems," Thunberg was quoted saying in the post.</p>

<p>The Karsto plant is operated by Norway's Equinor and is the largest of its kind in Europe, according to the company.</p>

<p>According to Equinor, around 30 oil and gas fields are connected to the plant. A company spokeswoman confirm the protest had been started.</p>

<p>"A group of activists have gathered outside parts of the facility, but at this stage the plant is operating as normal," Ellen Maria Skjelbaek told AFP.</p>

<p>Skjelbaek said police were dealing with the protest.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

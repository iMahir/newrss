       <description><![CDATA[The alleged crime occurred at a campground in Rogers, where the 21-year-old father, 20-year-old mother, and their baby have been living for approximately three months.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A couple from Northwest Arkansas is accused of attempting to sell their baby boy for $1,000 and beer, according to court documents in the felony case.&nbsp;As detailed in a Benton County Sheriff's Office arrest affidavit, the alleged crime occurred at a campground in Rogers, where Darien Urban, 21, and Shalene Ehlers, and their baby have been living for approximately three months. Rogers is situated in the Ozarks near the borders of Oklahoma and Missouri.</p>

<p>The condition of the baby was not immediately known as of Thursday.</p>

<p>According to the affidavit obtained by<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/09/26/arkansas-couple-sell-baby-for-money-beer-allegations/75393884007/" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em> USA TODAY</em></a>, deputies were called to Beaver Lake Hide Away Campground on September 21 after a report from someone in the manager's office claimed the couple was attempting to give their baby away in exchange for money and beer. The caller also informed authorities that the baby required medical attention due to observed rashes and blisters around the child's buttocks and genitals.</p>

<p>When deputies arrived, a detective noted in the affidavit that the couple was not present, and the baby was taken to a children's hospital.</p>

<p>The affidavit states that one witness approached the couple's camper, asked to take the baby overnight, and provided the couple with beers. The man told deputies that the couple agreed, so he took the baby out of concern for his welfare.</p>

<p>Another witness, a woman at the campground, also took the baby, changed his diaper, and bathed him. She captured photos of the blisters and rash to present to authorities.</p>

<p>On-site, deputies found a letter allegedly signed by the couple, agreeing to accept a cashier's check for $1,000 on Monday in exchange for the child. The letter stated, "I, Darien Urban and Shalene Ehlers are signing our rights over to Cody Nathaniel Martin of our baby boy [redacted] for $1,000 on 09/21/2024," the letter reads. "Disclaimer: After signing this there will be no changing yall two's minds and to never contact again."</p>

<p>Detectives also obtained cellphone video of both parents signing the letter.</p>

<p>During their interview with detectives, the couple claimed their baby "was undergoing an adoption" and stated they recorded the video because they planned to finalize the adoption on Monday, according to the affidavit.</p>

<p>Deputies arrested the couple and booked them into local jail on charges of felony endangering the welfare of a child and attempted relinquishment of a minor for adoption. A judge set their bond at $50,000 each.</p>

<p>Court and jail records indicated that both defendants were released on Thursday.</p>

<p>The parents are scheduled to appear in court on October 29.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A "partial peace" with Armenia is not a possibility, Azerbaijan's foreign minister said Saturday at the UN General Assembly's annual gathering, after Yerevan offered a more optimistic message.</p>

<p>The two former Soviet republics had seen decades of war and tension over Nagorno-Karabakh, a breakaway ethnic Armenian region in Azerbaijan.</p>

<p>After a series of slow-moving negotiations, Azerbaijan rushed in troops last year and swiftly seized back the area, whose entire population of nearly 120,000 people fled to Armenia.</p>

<p>"Partial peace is not an option after so much pain and suffering inflicted by... territorial claims against neighbors," Jeyhun Bayramov told the gathering, insisting in particular on a change to Armenia's constitution, which refers to "reunification" with Nagorno-Karabakh.</p>

<p>Azerbaijan's lightning offensive last year unfolded during the high-level UN meetings in New York, sparking disbelief and chagrin among Western diplomats, especially US and French officials who had been deeply involved in mediation efforts.</p>

<p>On Thursday, Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan said peace with Azerbaijan "not only is possible, but is within reach."</p>

<p>Azerbaijan and Armenia both say that 80 percent of a treaty is ready, including border delineation, but Azerbaijan first wants a resolution of all issues.</p>

<p>In his UN address, Pashinyan said he was ready to meet the Baku government's key demand of allowing transportation access across Armenian soil to the exclave of Nakhchivan, letting Azerbaijan connect its main territory with its traditional ally Turkey.</p>

<p>Pashinyan insisted that Azerbaijan and Armenia should sign the draft treaty immediately, explaining, "There is no precedent of a peace agreement or any agreement that would regulate and solve everything."</p>

<p>But on Saturday, Bayramov said any finalization of a deal would require Armenia to "legally abandon territorial claims against Azerbaijan once and for all through implementing constitutional amendments" so Baku's territorial integrity would not be in "legal limbo."</p>

<p>He also accused Yerevan of making a "dramatic increase" in its military budget and acquiring a "large amount of offensive weaponry from both traditional and new suppliers."</p>

<p>Bayramov nevertheless acknowledged "significant progress" in efforts by the neighbors to normalize relations, calling for "expeditious steps" to complete the process "at this critical moment."</p>

<p>Any changes to Armenia's constitution must be done through a referendum, a long and uncertain process. Western diplomats said they saw the request as a way for Baku to ask for the impossible to avoid signing a deal.</p>

<p>Potentially adding to momentum for a deal is COP29, the annual UN climate change talks that bring together officials from across the world, which will take place in the Azerbaijani capital Baku in November.</p>

<p>The international community is applying added pressure on Baku to reach an agreement before COP29.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A US woman has pleaded guilty to running a high-end sex racket in the greater Boston area and the suburbs of Washington that served politicians, military officers, lawyers, and corporate executives.</p>

<p>Han Lee, 42, appeared in Boston federal court on Friday to plead guilty to charges that she conspired to "persuade, induce and entice" primarily Asian women to travel to Massachusetts and Virginia to engage in prostitution and committed money laundering, prosecutors said.</p>

<p>The Massachusetts resident was arrested and charged in November last year along with Junmyung Lee, 31, and James Lee, 69. They were subsequently indicted by a federal grand jury in February for operating the prostitution racket.</p>

<p>Han Lee faces up to 25 years in prison when she is sentenced in December. She told the judge that while she ran an illegal prostitution business, she did not force any women to engage in sex work.</p>

<h3><strong>How They Operated The Sex Racket</strong></h3>

<p>According to prosecutors, from at least July 2020, Han Lee operated an interstate prostitution network with multiple brothels in Cambridge and Watertown, Massachusetts, and Fairfax and Tysons, Virginia</p>

<p>She established the infrastructure for these brothels in multiple states for the purposes of "persuading, inducing and enticing women - primarily Asian women - to travel to Massachusetts and Virginia to engage in prostitution," prosecutors said.</p>

<p>It is further alleged that Han Lee and her aides coordinated the women's airline travel and transportation and permitted them to stay overnight in the brothel locations so they did not have to find lodging elsewhere, therefore enticing women to participate in their prostitution network.</p>

<p>"To protect and maintain the secrecy of the business and ensure that the women did not draw attention to the prostitution work inside apartment buildings, Han Lee and, allegedly, her co-defendants established house rules for the women during their stays," prosecutors said.</p>

<h3><strong>Charged $350 To $600 For Sex Services</strong></h3>

<p>Han Lee charged sex buyers $350 to $600 per hour depending on the services and only took cash.</p>

<p>They allegedly advertised their prostitution network and offered appointments with women via two websites. Both websites purported to advertise nude models for professional photography at upscale studios as a front for prostitution offered through appointments.</p>

<p>It is further alleged that Han Lee maintained local brothel phone numbers which they used to communicate with verified customers and schedule appointments via text messages; send customers a "menu" of available options at the brothel, including the women and sexual services available and the hourly rate; and to text customers directions to the brothel's location where they engaged in commercial sex with the women.</p>

<p>To conceal the proceeds of the prostitution network, Han Lee deposited hundreds of thousands of dollars of cash proceeds into personal and third-party bank accounts and peer-to-peer transfers, prosecutors said.</p>

<p>It is also alleged that they regularly used hundreds of thousands of dollars of the cash proceeds from the prostitution business to purchase money orders (in values under an amount that would trigger reporting and identification requirements) to conceal the source of the funds.</p>

<p>These money orders were then used to pay for rent and utilities at brothel locations in Massachusetts and Virginia, prosecutors said.</p>

<p>Her clients have so far not been identified but authorities have estimated the network's customer base was in the hundreds and included elected officials, pharmaceutical and technology executives, doctors, military officers, professors, lawyers, business executives, scientists and accountants.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p>

<p>Donald Trump on Saturday called Democrat Kamala Harris "mentally impaired" and said illegal immigrants are out to cut the throats of ordinary Americans in their own homes as he doubled down on the racially charged rhetoric fueling his unprecedented bid to regain the US presidency.</p>

<p>Trump was seeking to strike back at Harris after she visited the US-Mexico border on Friday and vowed to do more to control asylum claims and undocumented migrant crossings.</p>

<p>The issue is one of the Democratic vice president's weakest in polling, as she runs neck-and-neck against Trump in the November 5 election.</p>

<p>Trump dismissed Harris's speech at the border, swearing and telling supporters in the small town of Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin, that President Joe Biden and Harris are responsible for an "invasion" of violent criminals.</p>

<p>Anti-immigrant sentiment has been at the core of Trump's appeal in economically depressed, majority-white parts of the country ever since his 2016 presidential victory, but the rhetoric is turning ever more extreme as election day nears.</p>

<p>The 78-year-old businessman -- the first major presidential candidate in US history to be a convicted felon and subject of multiple ongoing court cases -- said former California prosecutor Harris, 59, is "dumb."</p>

<p>"Joe Biden became mentally impaired. Kamala was born that way. She was born that way. And if you think about it, only a mentally disabled person could have allowed this to happen to our country," he said.</p>

<p>Harris, meanwhile, spent Saturday at a fundraiser in San Francisco, California, where she said Trump was using "the same tired playbook we've heard for years."</p>

<p>"This election is about two very different visions for our nation and we see that contrast on the campaign trail," she said.</p>

<p>Trump spoke in Wisconsin while flanked on stage by large mugshots of migrants accused of crimes, painting a hellish picture of an America under violent assault -- despite a plunge this year in illegal border crossings and what the FBI says is a steep decline in crime overall, particularly murder.</p>

<p>"They will walk into your kitchen, they'll cut your throat," Trump said of illegal immigrants.</p>

<p>"Small towns in America are terrified of migrants coming in and, even when they haven't arrived, they're terrified," he said. They will "rape, pillage, thieve, plunder and kill the people of the United States of America."</p>

<p>The illegal migrants, whom he called "animals," will take the jobs of minorities and of union workers, he added.</p>

<p>Apparently rankled by Harris's bid Friday to deliver a tough message on the Mexican border, Trump cursed on the nationally streamed event and branded her "a liar."</p>

<p>He complained that Fox News, the conservative network which has provided him with a loyal platform throughout his White House career, had covered Harris's speech.</p>

<p>"They shouldn't be allowed to put it on," he said.</p>

<p>Evidently, Trump was aware that his speech was unlike what Americans have been used to in presidential campaigns over the years.</p>

<p>He paused at one point to say: "Isn't this a wonderful and inspiring speech? I've got people sitting in the front row -- they're going 'oh my God.'"</p>

<p>"This is a dark, this is a dark speech," he said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A report that a Nazi song was sung at the funeral of a far-right ex-official in Austria caused outrage on Saturday, on the eve of national elections, for which the far right leads opinion polls.</p>

<p>The far-right Freedom Party (FPOe) -- which was founded by former Nazis -- is in a close race with the ruling conservatives to win Sunday's vote, which would mark a historic victory.</p>

<p>In the lead-up to the vote, FPOe leader Herbert Kickl has frequently employed terms reminiscent of the party's troubled past, including calling himself the future "Volkskanzler" -- the people's chancellor -- as Adolf Hitler was termed in the 1930s.</p>

<p>On Friday, several FPOe officials attended the Vienna funeral of FPOe former district counsellor Walter Sucher, where a Nazi song was sung, the Standard daily reported.</p>

<p>The Standard published a video it had received showing people attending a funeral at a cemetery, and standing by a grave singing a song evoking the "holy German Reich".</p>

<p>The FPOe did not immediately reply to an AFP request for comment, but in comments to Austrian news agency APA it condemned the way the incident had been politicised.</p>

<p>"To now want to politically abuse the funeral of a private person -- in the planning or shaping of which the FPOe was not involved in any way whatsoever -- is disrespectful and shabby," it said.</p>

<p>The Jewish Austrian Students group said it had filed a complaint with prosecutors over the video. In a statement, it called the incident an "alarm signal for Austria".</p>

<p>Political parties across the spectrum have also condemned the video.</p>

<p>In a post on X, the conservative People's Party (OeVP) reiterated it would not cooperate with Kickl -- who has "no qualms being associated with right-wing extremists" -- to form a government, urging people to vote OeVP to "strengthen the centre".</p>

<p>Social Democrats (SPOe) leader Andreas Babler said on X that the incident showed once again that "a democratic state cannot be created" with the FPOe.</p>

<p>The FPOe has frequently faced accusations of anti-Semitism, which it denies.</p>

<p>Under Kickl, the party has built on anger over migration, inflation and Covid restrictions to gain voters. It currently stands at 27 percent of voter support in opinion polls, just ahead of the OeVP at 25 percent.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Twelve pro-Iranian fighters have been killed in air strikes of unknown origin in eastern Syria, a war monitor said Sunday, adding that a large number of people were wounded.</p>

<p>"Twelve pro-Iranian fighters were killed in air strikes of unknown origin targeting their positions in the city of Deir Ezzor and to the east of the city, as well as the Boukamal region, near the border with Iraq," said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.</p>

<p>The strikes were not immediately claimed by any entity, according to the monitor.</p>

<p>Five of the strikes had targeted military positions near Deir Ezzor airport, it added.</p>

<p>Iran has been providing military aid to Syria since the civil war there began in 2011, while Israel has carried out hundreds of strikes targeting pro-Iranian groups in eastern Syria. The United States has also targeted such groups in the country's east.</p>

<p>Israeli authorities rarely comment on individual strikes in Syria, but have repeatedly said they will not allow arch-enemy Iran to expand its presence there.</p>

<p>Israel has launched an intense bombing campaign against Hezbollah strongholds in Lebanon in recent days, intensifying fears of a regional war.</p>

<p>The Israeli army has also repeatedly targeted the movement's arms supply routes on the Syrian-Lebanese border, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The death count from powerful Storm Helene has reached at least 63, authorities said Saturday, as responders, hampered by washed-out bridges and debris-strewn roads, searched house-by-house for survivors in devastated parts of several southern and eastern US states.</p>

<p>At least 24 people died in South Carolina, 17 in Georgia, 11 in Florida, 10 in North Carolina and one in Virginia, according to updated reports from local authorities and media tallied by AFP.</p>

<p>Helene slammed into Florida late Thursday as a Category 4 hurricane and surged north, gradually weakening but leaving a path of destruction.</p>

<p>Federal emergencies were declared in six states -- Alabama, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee -- with more than 800 personnel from the Federal Emergency Management Administration (FEMA) deployed to assist local officials.</p>

<p>Repair crews were already at work Saturday, and the National Weather Service said conditions would "continue to improve today following the catastrophic flooding over the past two days."</p>

<p>But it warned of possible "long-duration power outages."</p>

<p>More than 2.7 million customers were still without electricity across 10 states from Florida in the southeast to Indiana in the midwest as of Saturday night, according to tracker poweroutage.us.</p>

<p><strong>'It breaks my heart'</strong></p>

<p>Helene originally slammed into Florida's northern Gulf shore with powerful winds of 140 miles (225 kilometers) per hour. Even as a weakened post-tropical cyclone, it has caused chaos.</p>

<p>Record levels of flooding had threatened to break through several dams, but Tennessee emergency officials said Saturday that the Nolichucky Dam -- which had been close to breaching -- was no longer in danger of giving way and people downriver could return home.</p>

<p>Massive flooding was reported in Asheville, in western North Carolina. Governor Ray Cooper called it "one of the worst storms in modern history" to hit his state.</p>

<p>Some residents in South Carolina -- a state that is no stranger to hurricanes -- said Helene was the worst storm to hit in 40 years.</p>

<p>There were reports of remote towns in the Carolina mountains without power or cell service, their roads washed away or buried by mudslides.</p>

<p>In Cedar Key, an island city of 700 people off Florida's Gulf Coast, the full destructive force of the hurricane was on view.</p>

<p>Several pastel-colored wooden homes were destroyed, victims of record storm surges and ferocious winds.</p>

<p>"I've lived here my whole life, and it breaks my heart to see it. We've not really been able to catch a break," said Gabe Doty, a Cedar Key official, referring to two other hurricanes in the past year.</p>

<p><strong>'Gut punch'</strong></p>

<p>In South Carolina, the dead included two firefighters, officials said.</p>

<p>Georgia's 17 deaths included an emergency responder, according to state officials.</p>

<p>Florida Governor Ron DeSantis said the damage from Helene exceeded that of hurricanes Idalia and Debby, which both hit the same region southeast of Tallahassee in the last 13 months.</p>

<p>"It's a real gut punch to those communities," DeSantis told Fox News.</p>

<p>And in the Tennessee town of Erwin, a dramatic rescue operation unfolded, as more than 50 patients and staff trapped on a hospital roof by surging floodwaters had to be rescued by helicopters.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Low-lying neighbourhoods in Nepal's capital Kathmandu were inundated by surging floodwaters on Sunday after ferocious monsoon rains that police said had killed at least 101 people around the Himalayan republic.</p>

<p>Deadly rain-related floods and landslides are common across South Asia during the monsoon season from June to September, but experts say climate change is increasing their frequency and severity.</p>

<p>Large swathes of eastern and central Nepal have been inundated since Friday with flash floods reported in several rivers and extensive damage to the country's highways.</p>

<p>"The death count has reached 101, and 64 people are missing," police spokesperson Dan Bahadur Karki told AFP.</p>

<p>"There is likely to be an increase in the death count as our search and rescue mission proceeds in the affected areas," he added.</p>

<p>The Kathmandu valley recorded 240 millimetres (9.4 inches) of rain in the 24 hours to Saturday morning, the country's weather bureau told the Kathmandu Post newspaper.</p>

<p>It was the highest rainfall recorded in the capital since at least 1970, the report said.</p>

<p>The Bagmati river and its numerous tributaries which cut through Kathmandu broke their banks, inundating nearby homes and vehicles.</p>

<p>Residents pushed through chest-deep water to get to higher ground, with nearly 3,300 people rescued by relief teams as of Sunday morning.</p>

<p>More than 3,000 security personnel were deployed to assist rescue efforts with helicopters and motorboats.</p>

<p>Rescue teams were using rafts to pull survivors to safety.</p>

<p>Landslides have blocked several highways connecting the capital to the rest of the country, leaving hundreds of travellers stranded.</p>

<p>"We have around eight locations, all of them have been blocked due to landslides in different sections of the road," Kathmandu traffic police officer Bishwaraj Khadka said on Saturday.</p>

<p>Domestic flights have resumed in and out of Kathmandu after weather forced a complete stoppage from Friday evening, with more than 150 departures cancelled.</p>

<p>The summer monsoon brings South Asia 70-80 percent of its annual rainfall.</p>

<p>Monsoon rains from June to September bring widespread death and destruction every year across South Asia, but the number of fatal floods and landslides have increased in recent years.</p>

<p>Experts say climate change has worsened their frequency and intensity.</p>

<p>A landslide that hit a road in Chitwan district in July pushed two buses with 59 passengers aboard into a river.</p>

<p>Three people were able to escape alive, but authorities managed to recover only 20 bodies from the accident, with raging flood waters impeding the search.</p>

<p>More than 260 people have died in Nepal in rain-related disasters this year.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This autumn, Earth will briefly welcome a new visitor. A small asteroid is set to be caught by the planet's gravitational field, becoming a temporary "mini-moon" from September 29 to November 25 before resuming its journey through space.</p>

<p>The mini-moon's arrival has sparked interest among stargazers and space enthusiasts. Unfortunately, it won't be visible to the naked eye due to its small size and lack of brightness. Even binoculars or home telescopes won't reveal it- professional equipment is needed to catch a glimpse.</p>

<p>According to Dr Jennifer Millard, host of the Awesome Astronomy podcast, professional telescopes will capture images of the mini-moon. "You'll be able to see wonderful pictures online of this little dot speeding past the stars," Millard told the BBC.</p>

<h2><strong>Asteroid 2024 PT5</strong></h2>

<p>The asteroid, named 2024 PT5, originates from the Arjuna asteroid belt, which contains rocks with orbits similar to Earth's. It was first detected on August 7 by NASA's Asteroid Terrestrial-Impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) and measures around 33 feet wide.</p>

<p>The asteroid, named 2024 PT5, originates from the Arjuna asteroid belt, which contains rocks with orbits similar to Earth's. It was first detected on August 7 by NASA's Asteroid Terrestrial-Impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) and measures around 33 feet wide.</p>

<p>"It won't complete a full revolution around Earth. Its orbit will be slightly altered by our planet before it continues on its way," Millard explained.</p>

<p>Some asteroids get close to Earth, coming as near as 2.8 million miles (4.5 million km). If an asteroid, like 2024 PT5, moves at a relatively slow speed- around 2,200 mph (3,540 km/h)-Earth's gravity can temporarily trap it, which is exactly what's about to happen this weekend.</p>

<p>Mini-moons have been spotted before, and many more are likely to have gone unnoticed. Some even return for repeat visits, like asteroid 2022 NX1, which became a mini-moon in 1981 and again in 2022.</p>

<p>If you miss this event, don't worry-2024 PT5 is expected to return to Earth's orbit in 2055.</p>

<p>"This story shows just how busy our solar system is and how much remains undiscovered. This asteroid was only detected earlier this year," Millard added.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On Friday, three activists from Just Stop Oil threw soup at two of Vincent van Gogh's "Sunflowers" paintings at London's National Gallery. This incident occurred just hours after two other members of the protest group were sentenced to prison for a similar act in 2022.</p>

<p>The gallery in a statement said "a soup-like substance" had been thrown over "Sunflowers" (1888) and "Sunflowers" (1889) and that three people had been arrested.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Just Stop Oil group (JSO) described their latest action as a "sign of defiance" after two of its members were jailed earlier on Friday for throwing soup at Vincent van Gogh's "Sunflowers" (1888) in October 2022.&nbsp;</p>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p></p>

<p>This incident is part of a broader series of protests by JSO, which advocates for ending the extraction and burning of fossil fuels. These demonstrations have led to increasingly strict responses from authorities, <em>AFP</em> reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In July, Phoebe Plummer, 23, and Anna Holland, 22, were found guilty of criminal damage for pouring tomato soup over the protective screen covering the famous painting. Plummer received a two-year prison sentence on Friday, while Holland was sentenced to 20 months. Both had pleaded not guilty.</p>

<p>Will McCallum, co-executive director of Greenpeace UK, condemned the sentences as "draconian and disproportionate" for what he described as minor damage to the picture frame.</p>

<p>However, Judge Christopher Hehir, who sentenced the activists, argued that the painting could have been "seriously damaged or even destroyed." He criticized the pair for their indifference, stating, "You had no right to do what you did to 'Sunflowers'."</p>

<p>Supporters of Plummer and Holland gathered outside Southwark Crown Court with banners declaring them "political prisoners." The judge dismissed the notion, calling it "ludicrous, offensive and idiotic." He told Plummer, "You think your beliefs entitle you to do anything."</p>

<p>The National Gallery reported that while the protesters caused approximately $13,420 in damage to the frame, the painting itself remained unharmed, protected by a screen. Holland and Plummer had also glued themselves to the gallery wall during the protest.</p>

<p>Plummer had already served 58 days in remand for another protest at London's Heathrow Airport in July. McCallum described the sentencing as "another grim milestone in the ongoing crackdown on peaceful protest," adding that protests are naturally "inconvenient and occasionally messy."</p>

<p>Holland, ahead of her sentencing, said prison would not deter their activism.</p>

<p>JSO identified those involved in Friday's protest as Phil Green, 24, Ludi Simpson, 71, and Mary Patricia Somerville, 77, who confirmed they had thrown soup at the paintings. "We will face the full force of the law," said Simpson, while questioning when fossil fuel executives and politicians would be held accountable for the environmental damage they are causing.</p>

<p>The gallery confirmed that the paintings were examined by a conservator and found to be unharmed, with plans to reopen the exhibition as soon as possible.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Saturday confirmed that he personally authorised the operation to eliminate Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut. The 64-year-old Nasrallah was killed as Israeli strikes targeted dozens of Hezbollah sites in eastern and southern Lebanon following intense rocket fire by the group into northern Israel. Israeli jets bombarded Hezbollah strongholds in southern Beirut overnight, flattening several residential buildings.</p>

<p>Netanyahu termed Nasrallah's death as a critical achievement in Israel's military strategy and as a step toward restoring security along Israel's northern borders.</p>

<p>Addressing his country following Nasrallah's killing, Netanyahu said that Nasrallah had been responsible for orchestrating numerous attacks on Israelis and foreign nationals, including high-profile bombings in the 1980s.&nbsp;</p>

<p>These attacks included the 1983 bombings in Beirut that killed 63 people at the US embassy and hundreds of US Marines and French paratroopers. Netanyahu said that "terrorist" Nasrallah's death was vital for degrading Hezbollah's capabilities, stating, "As long as Nasrallah was alive, he would quickly restore the capabilities we had eroded from Hezbollah."</p>

<p>"We settled the score with the one responsible for the murder of countless Israelis and many citizens of other countries, including hundreds of Americans and dozens of French," he said&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Israeli Prime Minister pointed to the elimination of Nasrallah as a turning point that would accelerate the return of northern Israeli residents who had fled due to cross-border fire and further weaken Hamas, Hezbollah's ally in Gaza. "The more [Hamas leader Yahya] Sinwar sees that Hezbollah is no longer coming to save him, the greater the chances for the return of our hostages," Netanyahu said, referring to the ongoing efforts to secure the release of Israelis captured by Hamas during its October 7 attack.</p>

<p>Netanyahu praised Israel's military and intelligence agencies, including the IDF, Mossad, and Shin Bet, for executing the operation. "We are winning," he said.</p>

<p>Netanyahu used Nasrallah's death as an opportunity to warn Iran. He said that Israel's reach extends across the region, including Iran, and made clear that the killing of Nasrallah should serve as a message to Tehran and its proxies. "There is nowhere in Iran or the Middle East beyond the reach of the long arm of Israel, and today you know how true that is," he said. "I say to the Ayatollah's regime: whoever beat us, we will beat them."</p>

<p>Concluding his message, Netanyahu called this period a "historic turning point" and reaffirmed his commitment to the safe return of displaced residents and the recovery of hostages. He ended with a pledge of unity: "We will fight together, and with God's help, we will win together."</p>

<p>"We are determined to continue to strike at our enemies, return our residents to their homes, and return all our abductees. We do not forget them for a moment," he said.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Princess Diana's hairdresser has weighed in on the controversy surrounding Prince Harry and her riding instructor James Hewitt.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After years of rumours and speculations that Princess Diana's riding instructor James Hewitt, and not King Charles, is the biological father of Prince Harry, a new memoir has shed some light on the nature of their relationship. For years, a few similarities between Hewitt and Harry -- ginger hair and freckles -- led to such rumours.<br />
<br />
Richard Dalton, Diana's hairdresser, has now weighed in on the controversy and even detailed his friendship with the late Princess in a new memoir, “It's All About the Hair”.<br />
<br />
“It's not possible,” Dalton told <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/princess-dianas-friend-devastating-prince-harry-paternity-rumors-not-possible">Fox News Digital</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“It was tough... Harry was already born a while before her relationship with Hewitt. And I don't think it's possible.” To support his statement, Dalton claimed even Princess Diana's brother and sister had "bright red hair".<br />
<br />
“Harry and the Spencer family have red hair. Charles, Diana's brother, had bright red hair when he was (in) college,” he said, adding he used to cut his hair back then.<br />
<br />
He added that Sarah, Diana's sister, also has bright red hair, while her other sister Jane was "more or less the same colouring as Diana."<br />
<br />
In his book, Dalton said that Diana “used to get very upset” over the reports of Hewitt being called Harry's father, adding that the "red hair was a trait from the Spencer family".<br />
<br />
Diana and Hewitt met each other for the first time in 1986, two years after Harry's birth in 1984, according to reports.<br />
<br />
Harry was born “long before Diana even met James Hewitt,” Dalton wrote in his book, adding the two had a "love affair," which lasted three years between 1989 and 1991.&nbsp;Both Harry and Hewitt have addressed the rumour in the past.<br />
<br />
Last year, Harry sued an outlet for apparently using unlawful techniques "on an industrial scale" to score on his life.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
"Numerous newspapers had reported a rumour that my biological father was James Hewitt, a man my mother had a relationship with after I was born," Harry said in a written statement.<br />
<br />
"At the time of this article and others similar to it, I wasn't actually aware that my mother hadn't met Major Hewitt until after I was born," he added.<br />
<br />
In 2002, Hewitt himself addressed the gossip and said, "There really is no possibility whatsoever that I am Harry's father. I can understand the interest, but Harry was already walking by the time my relationship with Diana began."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Democrat Tim Walz and Republican JD Vance will face off next week in the only scheduled US vice presidential debate, a chance for each man to reinforce his running mate's message to voters just weeks before the November 5 election.</p>

<p>Here are some details about the event:</p>

<p><strong>WHEN AND WHERE IS THE DEBATE?</strong></p>

<p>The 90-minute debate, hosted by CBS News, will take place on October 1 at 9 pm ET (0100 GMT on Oct. 2) in New York City, a Democratic stronghold that is the former home of Donald Trump, the Republican presidential candidate running against Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris.</p>

<p><strong>WHO ARE THE MODERATORS?</strong></p>

<p>The debate will take place at the CBS Broadcast Center and be moderated by CBS "Evening News" anchor Norah O'Donnell and "Face the Nation" moderator Margaret Brennan.</p>

<p><strong>HOW CAN YOU WATCH THE DEBATE?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>The event will be broadcast on the CBS network and live streamed on all platforms where CBS News 24/7 and Paramount+ are available. CBS said it will also be made available to simulcast.</p>

<p>The Sept. 10 presidential debate between Harris and Trump on ABC News drew 67 million television viewers.</p>

<p><strong>WHAT ARE THE GROUND RULES?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>There will be no audience. Candidates will stand behind lecterns for the duration of the debate. No props or pre-written notes will be allowed on stage. CBS News reserves the right to turn off candidate microphones.</p>

<p><strong>WHAT TO EXPECT FROM WALZ</strong></p>

<p>Walz, the governor of Minnesota, will likely use his "regular guy" reputation to try to appeal to voters, including some independents, who view Harris, a former senator from California, as too liberal.</p>

<p>The 60-year-old Walz is a former congressman who won elections in a Republican-leaning district before becoming governor.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As governor, he has pushed a progressive agenda including free school meals, tax cuts for the middle class and expanded paid leave for Minnesota workers.</p>

<p>Walz will likely try to needle Vance, as Harris did successfully in her debate with Trump. Walz has questioned Vance's Midwestern credentials and derided his 2016 memoir "Hillbilly Elegy" for its depiction of rural America.</p>

<p>"Like all regular people I grew up with in the heartland, JD studied at Yale, had his career funded by Silicon Valley billionaires and then wrote a bestseller trashing that community," Walz said at his first rally as Harris' vice presidential pick. "Come on! That's not what middle America is."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Walz, also a former high school teacher and football coach, has dismissed Trump and Vance as "creepy and, yes, weird," - a takedown that spread widely among Democrats.</p>

<p>The Democratic vice presidential candidate has linked Vance to a set of conservative policy proposals known as Project 2025, from which Trump has tried to distance himself.</p>

<p><strong>WHAT TO EXPECT FROM VANCE</strong></p>

<p>Vance, a US senator from Ohio, will have to work hard not to be on the defensive throughout the debate if Walz employs Harris' debate strategy.</p>

<p>Vance, 40, likely will face questions about his inflammatory rhetoric and could punch back with his typical combative style.</p>

<p>He has been criticized for referring to Harris and other Democrats in 2021 as a "bunch of childless cat ladies," and more recently, for spreading false claims that Haitian migrants in the Ohio city of Springfield were eating pets.</p>

<p>He has also claimed without evidence that the suspect in the latest assassination attempt against Trump was acting on Democrats' inflammatory language.</p>

<p>"The big difference between conservatives and liberals is that ... no one has tried to kill Kamala Harris in the last couple of months and two people now have tried to kill Donald Trump in the last couple of months," said Vance in comments that drew a rebuke from the White House.</p>

<p>On the campaign trail, Vance has portrayed Walz and Harris as radical liberals.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He also has questioned Walz's depictions of his military record and his family's fertility struggles.</p>

<p>Vance, who served in the Marine Corps and was a public affairs officer during a six-month stint in Iraq, has accused Walz of leaving the Army National Guard to avoid being deployed to Iraq and of falsely suggesting he served in combat.</p>

<p>Walz, who served in the Guard for 24 years, retired to run for Congress. He has defended his record, but the Harris campaign has acknowledged he misspoke in a 2018 video in which he referenced "weapons of war that I carried into war." Walz never served in a combat zone.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[In the early years, getting AI models like ChatGPT or its rival Cohere to spit out human-like responses required vast teams of low-cost workers helping models distinguish basic facts such as if an image was of a car or a carrot.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the early years, getting AI models like ChatGPT or its rival Cohere to spit out human-like responses required vast teams of low-cost workers helping models distinguish basic facts such as if an image was of a car or a carrot.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But more sophisticated updates to AI models in the fiercely competitive arena are now demanding a rapidly expanding network of human trainers who have specialized knowledge -- from historians to scientists, some with doctorate degrees.</p>

<p>"A year ago, we could get away with hiring undergraduates, to just generally teach AI on how to improve," said Cohere co-founder Ivan Zhang, talking about its internal human trainers.</p>

<p>"Now we have licensed physicians teaching the models how to behave in medical environments, or financial analysts or accountants."</p>

<p>For more training, Cohere, which was last valued at over $5 billion, works with a startup called Invisible Tech. &nbsp;Cohere is one of the main rivals of OpenAI and specializes in AI for businesses.</p>

<p>The startup Invisible Tech employs thousands of trainers, working remotely, and has become one of the main partners of AI companies ranging from AI21 to Microsoft to train their AI models to reduce errors, known in the AI world as hallucinations.</p>

<p>"We have 5,000 people in over 100 countries around the world that are PhDs, Master's degree holders and knowledge work specialists," said Invisible founder Francis Pedraza.</p>

<p>Invisible pays as much as $40 per hour, depending on the location of the worker and the complexity of work. Some companies such as Outlier pay up to $50 per hour, while another company called Labelbox said it pays up to $200 per hour for "high expertise" subjects like quantum physics, but starts with $15 for basic topics.</p>

<p>Invisible was founded in 2015 as a workflow automation company catering to the likes of food delivery company DoorDash to digitize their delivery menu. But things changed when a relatively unknown research firm called OpenAI contacted them in the spring of 2022, ahead of the public launch of ChatGPT.</p>

<p>"OpenAI came to us with a problem, which is that when you were asking an early version of ChatGPT a question, it was going to hallucinate. You couldn't trust the answer," Pedraza told Reuters.</p>

<p>"They needed an advanced AI training partner to provide reinforcement learning with human feedback."</p>

<p>OpenAI did not respond to request for comment.</p>

<p>Generative AI produces new content based on past data used to train it. However, sometimes it can't distinguish between true and false information and generates false outputs known as hallucinations. In one notable example, in 2023 a Google chatbot shared inaccurate information about which satellite first took pictures of a planet outside the Earth's solar system in a promotional video.</p>

<p>AI companies are aware that hallucinations can derail GenAI's attractiveness to businesses and are trying various ways to reduce it, including using human trainers to teach the concept of fact and fiction.</p>

<p>Since getting onboard with OpenAI, Invisible says it has become AI training partners to most of the GenAI companies, including Cohere, AI21 and Microsoft. Cohere and AI21 confirmed they are clients. Microsoft did not confirm it is a client of Invisible.</p>

<p>"These are all companies that had training challenges, where their number one cost was compute power, and then the number two cost is quality training," Pedraza said.</p>

<p><strong>HOW DOES IT WORK?</strong></p>

<p>OpenAI, which started off the frenzy around GenAI, has a team of researchers aptly named "Human Data Team" that works with AI trainers to gather specialized data for training its models like ChatGPT.</p>

<p>OpenAI researchers come up with various experiments like reducing hallucinations or to improve writing style and work with AI trainers from Invisible and other vendors, a source familiar with the company's processes said.</p>

<p>At any point, dozens of experiments are being run, some with tools developed by OpenAI and others by tools of vendors, the person said.</p>

<p>Based on what the AI companies want - from getting better at Swedish history or doing financial modeling - Invisible hires workers with relevant degrees for those projects, reducing the burden of managing hundreds of trainers by the AI companies.</p>

<p>"OpenAI has some of the most incredible computer scientists in the world but they're not necessarily an expert in Swedish history or chemistry questions or biology questions or anything you can ask it," Pedraza said, adding that over 1,000 contract workers cater to OpenAI alone. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Cohere's Zhang said he has personally used Invisible's trainers to find a way to teach its GenAI model to find relevant information from a big data set.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>COMPETITION</strong></p>

<p>Among the competitors in this space is Scale AI, a private start-up last valued at $14 billion which provides AI companies with sets of training data. It has also ventured into the area of providing AI trainers, and counts OpenAI as a customer. &nbsp;Scale AI did not respond to requests for an interview for this story.</p>

<p>Invisible, which has been profitable since 2021, has raised only $8 million of primary capital, &nbsp;</p>

<p>"We are 70% owned by the team, and only 30% owned by investors," Pedraza said. "We do facilitate secondary rounds, and the most recent traded price was at a half a billion dollar valuation." Reuters could not confirm that valuation.</p>

<p>Human trainers first got into AI training through data-labelling work that required less qualification and was also paid less, sometimes as low as $2, mostly done by people in African and Asian countries.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As AI companies launch more advanced models, the demand for specialized trainers and across dozens of languages is on the rise, creating a well-paid niche where workers from a variety of subjects could become AI trainers without even knowing how to code.</p>

<p>Demand from AI companies is leading to the creation of more companies that are offering similar services.</p>

<p>"My inbox is basically inundated with new firms that pop up here and there. I do see this as a new space where companies hire humans just to create data for AI labs like us," Zhang said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The son of Mohamed Al-Fayed, the late former boss of Harrods accused of sexually assaulting scores of employees, has said the allegations had "thrown into question the loving memory I had of him".</p>

<p>Lawyers say some 60 women have come forward to allege they were abused by Fayed, who died last year aged 94, following a television documentary in which women accused him of raping and sexually assaulting them.</p>

<p>"I am horrified and deeply concerned by the allegations recently brought to light against my late father," said Omar Fayed in a statement.</p>

<p>"The extent and explicit nature of the allegations are shocking and has thrown into question the loving memory I had of him," he said.</p>

<p>"How this matter could have been concealed for so long and in so many ways raises further disturbing questions," he added.</p>

<p>The avalanche of accusations against the late Egyptian billionaire follow a BBC expose last week in which women recounted being targeted by Fayed when they worked for Harrods, the luxury department store in London he owned for 25 years.</p>

<p>His son said that although he loved his father "very much" and that he was a "wonderful dad, that aspect of our relationship... does not blind me from an objective assessment of circumstances".</p>

<p>The alleged victims deserved "full transparency and accountability," he added in a statement to Sky News late on Friday.</p>

<p>"I will continue to support the principles of truth, justice, accountability and fairness, regardless of where that journey may lead. No-one is above the law," he said.</p>

<p>Fayed's accusers say the assaults took place in his apartments in London and his properties in Paris, including the Ritz hotel.</p>

<p>Allegations include a repeated pattern of women who underwent a selection process for positions close to Fayed.</p>

<p>Once selected, they were subjected to an "invasive" gynaecological examination, the results of which were shared with Fayed.</p>

<p>The women said that when they tried to complain about their abuse, they were threatened by senior security staff, demoted and subjected to false allegations until they had "no choice" but to leave Harrods.</p>

<p>Fayed sold Harrods in 2010 to the investment arm of Qatar's sovereign wealth fund for a reported £1.5 billion ($2.2 billion).</p>

<p>He also owned Fulham Football Club and the Ritz Hotel in Paris.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden on Saturday called the killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah "a measure of justice for his many victims, including thousands of Americans, Israelis and Lebanese civilians."</p>

<p>In a statement a day after an Israeli air strike killed Nasrallah, Biden reiterated US support for "Israel's right to defend itself against Hezbollah, Hamas, the Houthis, and any other Iranian-supported terrorist groups."</p>

<p>Biden added that he had directed the defense secretary to "further enhance the defense posture of US military forces in the Middle East region to deter aggression and reduce the risk of a broader regional war."</p>

<p>Biden's statement came as the State Department ordered the family members of its diplomats in Beirut to leave, while authorizing the departure of some staff "due to the volatile and unpredictable security situation in Beirut."</p>

<p>The agency also urged US citizens to leave "while commercial options still remain available."</p>

<p>Military officials in Israel announced on Saturday morning that Nasrallah, who headed the armed movement for more than three decades, died in a bombardment targeting the group's headquarters in the southern suburbs of Beirut Friday night.</p>

<p>Hezbollah officially confirmed the death hours later.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on Saturday told the UN General Assembly that unviable projects raise debt levels and any connectivity that clouds sovereignty and territorial integrity acquires strategic connotations, especially when it is not a shared endeavour, in a veiled reference to China.</p>

<p>"We are gathered here at a difficult time. The world is yet to recover from the ravages of the Covid pandemic. A war in Ukraine is well into its third year. The conflict in Gaza is acquiring wider ramifications," Mr Jaishankar said in his address to the General Debate of the 79th session of the UN General Assembly.</p>

<p>Across the Global South, he said, development plans have gone off rails and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) targets are receding.</p>

<p>"But there is more. Unfair trade practices threaten jobs, just as unviable projects raise debt levels. Any connectivity that clouds sovereignty and territorial integrity acquires strategic connotations, especially when it is not a shared endeavour," he said, in an apparent reference to China's multi-billion-dollar Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).</p>

<p>Mr Jaishankar said technology advancements, which have long been a source of hope, are now equally a factor of anxiety.</p>

<p>"Climate events occur with greater intensity and frequency. Food security is as worrisome as health security. In truth, the world stands fractious, polarised and frustrated. Conversations have become difficult, agreements even more so. This is surely not what the founders of the United Nations would have wanted of us," he said.</p>

<p>The EAM said today, both peace and prosperity are equally endangered, and that is because trust has eroded and processes have broken down.</p>

<p>"Countries have extracted more from the international system than they have put into it, enfeebling it in the process," he said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Millions of Americans were still without power and many faced torrential flooding on Saturday, authorities said, as powerful storm Helene rumbled across eastern and midwestern US states, leaving at least 44 people dead.</p>

<p>At least 19 people died in South Carolina, 15 in Georgia, seven in Florida, two in North Carolina and one in Virgina, according to updated reports from local authorities tallied by AFP.</p>

<p>Repair crews were already at work after Helene slammed into Florida late Thursday as a Category 4 hurricane and surged north, gradually weakening but leaving a path of rare devastation.</p>

<p>"Conditions will continue to improve today following the catastrophic flooding over the past two days," said the National Weather Service.</p>

<p>But it warned of possible "long-duration power outages."</p>

<p>Though power has been restored in some areas, more than three million customers were still without electricity across 10 states as of midday Saturday, according to tracker poweroutage.us.</p>

<p><strong>'Move to higher ground'</strong></p>

<p>Helene originally slammed into Florida's northern Gulf shore with powerful winds of 140 miles (225 kilometers) per hour. Even as a weakened post-tropical cyclone, it has caused destruction.</p>

<p>Record levels of flooding threatened to breach dams, with one dam in Tennessee on the verge of failure, authorities said, urging residents to move to higher ground.</p>

<p>Massive flooding was reported in Asheville, a city in western North Carolina. Governor Ray Cooper called it "one of the worst storms in modern history" to hit his state.</p>

<p>In Cedar Key, an island city of 700 people just off Florida's northwest coast, the full destructive force of the hurricane was on view.</p>

<p>Several pastel-colored wooden homes were destroyed, victims of record storm surges and ferocious winds.</p>

<p>"I've lived here my whole life, and it breaks my heart to see it. We've not really been able to catch a break," said Gabe Doty, a Cedar Key official, referring to two earlier hurricanes in the past year.</p>

<p><strong>'Gut punch'</strong></p>

<p>In South Carolina the dead included two firefighters and six residents of Spartanburg County, officials said.</p>

<p>Georgia Governor Brian Kemp's office confirmed 15 deaths in his state, including an emergency responder.</p>

<p>Governor Ron DeSantis of Florida said the damage from Helene exceeded that of hurricanes Idalia and Debby, which both hit the same region southeast of Tallahassee in the last 13 months.</p>

<p>"It's a real gut punch to those communities," DeSantis told Fox News.</p>

<p>In the Tennessee town of Erwin, a dramatic rescue operation unfolded, as more than 50 patients and staff trapped on a hospital roof by surging floodwaters had to be rescued by helicopters.</p>

<p>Up to 12 inches (30 centimeters) of rain was forecast in the Appalachian mountains, with isolated spots receiving 20 inches.</p>

<p>Remnants of the weakened storm were hovering at midday Saturday over the Kentucky-Indiana border, bringing up to 2 inches of rain.</p>

<p><strong>'Overwhelming' damage</strong></p>

<p>In a statement Saturday, President Joe Biden called Helene's devastation "overwhelming." He said he was sending additional response personnel as the storm tracks north.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden and Prime Minister Narendra Modi hailed a watershed arrangement to set up a semiconductor fabrication plant focused on advanced sensing, communication, and power electronics for national security, next generation telecommunications, and green energy applications.</p>

<p>The plant (or fab), which will be built with the objective of manufacturing infrared, gallium nitride and silicon carbide semiconductors, will be enabled by support from the India Semiconductor Mission as well as a strategic technology partnership between Bharat Semi, 3rdiTech, and the US Space Force.</p>

<p>In a historic moment, the first ever National security Fab in India is announced as a technology partnership between Indian businesses Bharat Semi, 3rdiTech and US space force. This is the first ever India-US Semiconductor Fab cooperation of its kind.</p>

<p>It's for the first time the US military has agreed to do a technology partnership for these highly valued technologies with India, so it's a watershed moment as powerful as the civil nuclear deal.</p>

<p>The fab becomes not only India's first, but one of the world's first multi-material fab for national security. The Bharat Semi fab titled Shakti also became one of the first fabs of its kind in the Quad. The Fab will focus on three essential pillars for the modern warfighting - advanced sensing, advanced communications and high-voltage power electronics.</p>

<p>These three areas have huge growing needs for commercial sectors such as railways, telecom infrastructure, data centres and green energy. These semiconductors fall under a family known as 'compound semiconductors'.</p>

<p>Three Main Technology Areas</p>

<p>The three main technology areas are infrared, galium nitride, and silicon carbide. It is part of PM Modi's vision for India to become a chipmaker from a chip-taker. This fab will become a national asset and further help India's goals of becoming a net security provider in the region.</p>

<p>For a country to become a net security provider it needs to become a net technology provider. This is a glass ceiling that has been broken in tech diplomacy and years down the road it will be seen in history as a watershed moment in India-US relationship.</p>

<p>India's current import bill in these semiconductors for national security alone is $1 Billion a year. India and the US have signed multiple cooperation deals focused on critical tech with a special focus on semiconductors, from iCET to commerce to commerce MOU to the strategic trade dialogue.</p>

<p>This becomes the first true India US semiconductor fab project. Other projects in the past have included testing and assembly OSAT. But this is raising the game and going into true chip fabrication - the holy grail of semiconductors.</p>

<p>After this technology partnership, India will join a handful of elite nations with the capability and knowhow to manufacture these types of semiconductors on shore.</p>

<p>Bharat Semi and 3rdiTech are a true iCET success story and a true success story of PM Modi's Atmnanirbhar vision From the launch of iCET in January 2023 to building India's first compound semiconductor fab for national security.</p>

<p>This is history in the making as Bharat Semi and 3rdiTech emerge as national champions and truly the first Indian homegrown semiconductor integrated design and manufacturing company (IDM).</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday (local time) highlighted the relationship between India and the US in terms of artificial intelligence and gave a new meaning to it, describing it as the America-India spirit.</p>

<p>Addressing the Indian community at Nassau Coliseum in New York, Long Island at 'Modi&amp;US' Event, he said, "For the world, AI means artificial intelligence, but for me, AI also means American-Indian spirit. This is the new 'AI' power of the world....I salute the Indian diaspora here."</p>

<p>PM Modi said that Indian community has always been the country's strongest brand ambassadors.</p>

<p>"I have always understood your potential... the potential of the Indian diaspora. You have always been India's strongest band ambassador for me. That's why I call all of you 'Rashtradoot'."</p>

<p>"Now Apna Namaste has also become multinational. It has gone from local to global and you have done all this. Every Indian who keeps India in his heart has done this. You have connected India with America and America with India. Your skill, talent, and commitment are unmatched. Despite being overseas, no ocean can separate you from India," PM Modi added.</p>

<p>He also praised the Indian community for keeping up the tradition of "Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam" that means "the world is one family."</p>

<p>"Wherever we go, we treat everyone as family and mingle with them. Understanding diversity, living it, implementing it in our lives... it is in our values. Someone speaks Tamil... someone Telugu, someone Malayalam, someone Kannada... someone Punjabi, someone Marathi, someone Gujarati... There are many languages, but the feeling is one... and that feeling is - Indianness," said PM Modi.</p>

<p>Speaking on the diversity of India, PM Modi said, "We are residents of a country where there are hundreds of languages and dialects, all the religions and sects of the world. Still, we are moving ahead united and noble. This is our biggest strength to connect with the world. These values naturally bind us to the world."</p>

<p>Praising the Indian community for their talent and skill, he said that they connect India to America.</p>

<p>"You have connected India to America and America to India. Your skill, talent, and commitment have no competition. You might have come seven seas apart, but no sea has that much depth that it can distance you from India. What Ma Bharati has taught us, we can never forget that. Wherever we go, we accept all as family. To understand diversity, to live diversity is in our veins," said PM Modi.</p>

<p>America and India are poised to become AI powerhouses in the new world, and Prime Minister Modi's recent visit to the US has strengthened this partnership.</p>

<p>During his address at the Quad Leaders' Summit, PM Modi emphasized that the group is a "force of Global Good" that will contribute to the betterment of the world.</p>

<p>The US-India partnership has made significant strides in AI research and development. The Initiative on Critical and Emerging Technology (iCET) has facilitated cooperation in key areas like space, semiconductors, and advanced telecommunications.</p>

<p>The two nations are also collaborating on the development of small modular reactor technologies and exploring opportunities to expand cooperation in solar, wind, and nuclear energy.</p>

<p>The Indian community gave a standing ovation to PM Modi, as he entered the event venue, and took the stage. Talented artists from the Indian community took the stage, setting the perfect tone for PM Modi's imminent address to the Indian diaspora in the US.</p>

<p>PM Modi's address at "Modi and US" program is a historic event which is unfolding at the Nassau Coliseum in Long Island, New York, as 15,000 members of the Indian community gather from 42 different states to welcome the Prime Minister.</p>

<p>Later in the day, PM Modi will chair key bilateral meetings in New York and attend a CEO Roundtable in addition he will also address the Summit of the Future on September 23.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>India does not seek its dominance but wants to play a role in the prosperity of the world, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Sunday, asserting that India's role will be crucial in accelerating the global peace process.</p>

<p>Addressing thousands of Indian-Americans in New York, PM Modi said India today has a foreign policy of maintaining equal closeness with all and not equal distance.</p>

<p>Referring to his remarks "This is not the time for war," PM Modi told the Indian community that the severity and the seriousness of this was understood by all friends.</p>

<p>"Whenever in the world there is a disaster, India has come forward as a first responder," the prime minister said, referring to the recent help provided by New Delhi to people across the world including during the COVID-19 crisis to more than 150 countries.</p>

<p>India is the first country to arrive whenever there is an earthquake somewhere or a civil war somewhere, he said.</p>

<p>"The role of India would be crucial to accelerate the process of global growth, and India's role will be crucial to accelerate global peace," he said.</p>

<p>India's goal is not to increase its global influence but to play a part in its prosperity.</p>

<p>Whether it is promoting yoga, lifestyle or the environment, it does not aspire for only a GDP-centric but a human-centric growth for all of you, he said, adding that India "does not want to seek its global dominance".</p>

<p>India, he said, is not like fire. "We are like the sun which gives brightness," the prime minister said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday announced the Indian government will open two new consulates in the US -- one in Boston, and another in Los Angeles.</p>

<p>"Last year, I announced the opening of a new Indian consulate in Seattle. I sought your suggestions for two additional Consulates. India has now decided to open two new consulates in Boston and Los Angeles," PM Modi said.</p>

<p>PM Modi made this announcement while interacting with the Indian community in New York's Nassau Coliseum which was packed with excited and cheerful-looking faces while reverberating with chants of "Modi, Modi".</p>

<p>During his speech, PM Modi highlighted India's growing ties with the US. Addressing the crowd, he thanked the people for turning up at the event, making people repeat "Bharat Mata ki Jai" before concluding his speech.</p>

<p>Among the many issues PM Modi stressed during his speech was the BJP-led Central government's return to power. The crowd was heard raising slogans of "Ab ki Baar, Modi Sarkar" while the PM was speaking on the subject.</p>

<p>More than 16,000 people - many of them travelling from all corners of the US overnight - have gathered at the Long Island to listen to PM Modi's speech at the community reception.</p>

<p>A cultural programme, depicting the diversity of Indian culture, began long before the PM's arrival at the packed venue.</p>

<p>On Saturday, immediately after his arrival in Philadelphia, the Prime Minister had shared his eagerness to meet the Indian community and Americans from across the US at the New York event.</p>

<p>"The Indian community has distinguished itself in the USA, making a positive impact across diverse sectors. It's always a delight to interact with them. At around 9:30 PM India time on Sunday, 22nd September, I will address the 'Modi and US' programme in New York City. Let's celebrate the bonds that connect our nations!" he mentioned after landing in Philadelphia following a nearly 16-hour journey from Delhi.</p>

<p>Preparations for the key engagement, sandwiched between the Quad Summit convened by US President Joe Biden in Delaware on Saturday and PM Modi's address to the United Nations Summit of the Future on Monday, have been going on for the past many weeks with the organisers overwhelmed by the number of people who wanted to attend the event billed as 'Modi and US, Progress Together'.</p>

<p>"We are just so proud of Modiji, and we're proud to be part of this great celebration. Modiji, we love you, and we want you to be very successful in whatever you're doing for our country," said a lady who had arrived early at the venue on Sunday.</p>

<p>The multi-purpose arena, which is the home of the Long Island Nets basketball team, is in Uniondale, about 50 km from Manhattan.</p>

<p>"This is an event that's being organised by the community. As you know, we have about 4.5 million strong Indian community in the United States, amongst the largest such groups there, and one that has made a mark for itself and is contributing to the relationship between the two countries by acting as a vibrant living bridge between the two of us," Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri said earlier.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday said that India has no role in causing destruction to the world, in an apparent criticism of the West.</p>

<p>Addressing thousands of Indian-Americans at a community event in New York, PM Modi said that India has 17 per cent of the world's population and its carbon emissions are less than four per cent.</p>

<p>Talking about India's green energy transition, he said a large number of green jobs are being created in India.</p>

<p>"India represents about 17 per cent of the world's population, and despite that, our contribution to emission is about only four per cent," he said, adding India today has "no role in causing destruction" to the world.</p>

<p>China is the world's biggest carbon emitter followed by the US, India and the EU.</p>

<p>"Our carbon emission is almost negligible," he said, adding that like other countries, India could also have opted for a carbon fuel-driven growth. But that's not the case.</p>

<p>It's India's tradition for the love of nature, and that is why India is focusing on solar, wind, hydro, green hydrogen and nuclear energy areas in which they are carrying out investment.</p>

<p>Referring to the impressive digital progress made by India, PM Modi told Indian Americans that they might have wallets in their pockets here, but people in India have digital wallets. "No one can stop India now. India wants to have maximum mobile devices on 'Made in India' chips," he said.</p>

<p>The prime minister spoke about the remarkable progress made in the education sector. He wants students from across the world to come and study in India. The number of educational institutions has increased manifold.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>India is a launching pad of all sorts of technologies and the country now aspires to see 'Made in India' semiconductor chips running devices globally, Prime Minister Narendra Modi told a large gathering of Indian Americans in New York on the second day of his 3-day visit.</p>

<p>"India is not going to stop now; India is not going to slow down now. India wants more and more devices in the world to run on Made in India chips.," he told the gathering, outlining India's growing manufacturing capacity, particularly in the spheres of electronics and semiconductors.</p>

<p>"The day is not far when you will see Made in India chips here in America as well," the Prime Minister added.</p>

<p>In June, 2023, the Union Cabinet had approved a proposal for setting up a semiconductor unit in Sanand, Gujarat.</p>

<p>"Just a few months after this, the foundation stone of Micron's first semi-conductor unit was also laid. So far, five such units have been approved in India. The day is not far when you will see Made in India chips here in America as well. This small chip will take the flight of developed India to new heights and this is Modi's guarantee," the Prime Minister said.</p>

<p>The government has so far approved five semiconductor units in India, of which construction in two sites is on, and soon the work in the other three will start. They have already made a cumulative investment of almost Rs 1.5 lakh crore. He also spoke about India's innovations in digital public infrastructure, and how its adoption is growing at a rapid pace.</p>

<p>"Now India does not lag behind, it creates new systems and leads. India has given the new concept of digital public infrastructure (DPI) to the world," he said.</p>

<p>PM Modi apprised the community that India's 5G market has now become bigger than America's, and this has happened in just two years.</p>

<p>"Now, India is working on 'Made in India' 6G. This was possible because we made policies to promote this sector. We worked on Made in India technology," he said.</p>

<p>He also apprised the gathering how India has become a key player in mobile manufacturing, from being an importer to an exporter. PM Modi also spoke about India's commitment to climate mitigation, despite being a low emitter.</p>

<p>"Our conviction for reforms is unprecedented. Our Green Energy Transition programme is a good example of it. Despite having 17 per cent of the world's population, India's contribution is only 4 per cent in global carbon emissions. We have no role in destroying the world! We could have supported our growth by burning carbon fuel. However, we chose green energy transition," he said.</p>

<p>At COP26 held in 2021, India committed to an ambitious five-part "Panchamrit" pledge. They included reaching 500 GW of non-fossil electricity capacity, generating half of all energy requirements from renewables, and reducing emissions by 1 billion tonnes by 2030.<br />
India as a whole also aims to reduce the emissions intensity of GDP by 45 per cent. Finally, India commits to net-zero emissions by 2070. India meets a sizable portion of its energy needs through fossil fuels, and various renewable energy sources, are seen as an avenue to reduce the dependence on conventional sources of power.</p>

<p>Later on Sunday, Prime Minister Modi will interact with the CEOs of leading US-based companies to foster greater collaborations between the two countries in the cutting-edge areas of AI, quantum computing, semiconductors, and biotechnology, among others.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed his heartfelt gratitude to United States President Joe Biden for his warm hospitality during a visit to his home in Delaware, stating that it "touched my heart."</p>

<p>Addressing the Indian community at Nassau Coliseum in New York, PM Modi emphasised that the honour bestowed upon him is not just his own, but also belongs to 1.4 billion Indians and the millions of Indians living abroad</p>

<p>"I salute you all, the Indian diaspora. Wherever I go in the world, I hear praise for the Indian community from every leader. Yesterday, President Biden took me to his home in Delaware, and his warmth and hospitality touched my heart. This honour belongs to 1.4 billion Indians, it's your honour, your achievement, and the honour of the millions of Indians living here.

<p>Further, PM Modi also spoke on India's general elections held earlier this year and stated that "the recent elections in India were the largest in human history."</p>

<p>"Friends, 2024 is a crucial year for the world. On one hand, there's conflict and tension between nations, while on the other hand, many countries are celebrating democracy. India and the US stand together in this celebration of democracy, with elections happening in America and having taken place in India. The recent elections in India were the largest in human history. Just imagine, more voters than the total population of America, and even more than the entire population of Europe. So many people cast their votes in India," said PM Modi.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Modi is on a three-day visit to the US from September 21-23. As PM Modi entered the Nassau Coliseum in New York, Long Island today, he greeted the Indian community, with 'Bharat Mata ki Jai</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi today said he has always understood the potential and capabilities of the Indian community in the US, and for him, they have been strong brand ambassadors of India.</p>

<p>Addressing the Indian diaspora at Nassau Coliseum in New York, PM Modi talked of India's enormous diversity and adaptability of Indians when they go abroad.</p>

<p>"We belong to a country where there are dozens of languages and dialogues, all faiths and religions of the world and yet we are moving forward united," he said.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi today addressed tens of thousands of Indian-Americans in a grand community event at the Nassau Coliseum in Long Island. The chants of <em>"Modi, Modi"</em> filled the stadium as the prime minister walked on stage to address people of Indian origin.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister started his speech with the chants of <em>"Bharat Mata ki Jai!"</em>. He began by saying that even the <em>'Namaste'</em> has gone from being local to global, and credited the Indians settled overseas for it.</p>

<p>A series of cultural performances entertained the people gathered at the stadium, who were enthused as they waited for the Prime Minister's arrival.</p>

<p>During his speech, Prime Minister fondly recalled his previous community events in the United States - 2014 at the Madison Square Garden, 2016 in San Jose, California, 2018 in Houston, Texas, 2023 in Washington and now in Long Island.</p>

<p>He credited the Indians settled in the United States. He said that they have been the bridge between the two nations and have helped strengthen the India-US relationship. He said "you all have come seven seas apart, but nothing can ever take the love of India away from your hearts and souls."</p>

<p>He said that people from different parts of India may have settled overseas - here in the US too and have become US citizens, but "the sentiment that brings us all together is, <em>'Bharat Mata ki...(Jai!</em> chanted the spectators)'."</p>

<p>"This sentiment is what keeps us united, and this is our biggest strength, no matter where we go in the world," he said, adding that "It is this sentiment that helps us be peaceful, law abiding global citizens - what makes India proud of its children - and makes the world realise that India is the world's <em>'Vishwa-Bandhu'</em>."</p>

<p>Calling the Indians settled in the United States <em>'Rashtradoot'</em> (Ambassadors), the prime minister thanked the Indian community in the United States for the respect India has earned in that country, adding that "It is our Indian values and culture that makes us One."<br />

       <description><![CDATA[When asked about his plans for the windfall, he chose to keep his intentions private.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Virginia resident Nicholas Foxx's impromptu stop for an energy drink turned into a life-changing moment. While visiting family in Altavista, Mr Foxx popped into the A1 Mini Mart on Main Street to grab a quick pick-me-up. On a whim, he decided to purchase some scratch-off lottery tickets. Little did he know, one of those tickets would prove to be a $1 million top prize winner in the 20X the Money game. However, he chose the cash option of $625,000 rather than the option of taking the full $1 million prize over 30 years.</p>

<p>''I thought I was reading it wrong. You don't know anyone who's hit the Lottery for that amount of money,''&nbsp;he told lottery officials, reported&nbsp;<em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.wfxrtv.com/news/regional-news/virginia-news/virginia-resident-stops-for-an-energy-drink-and-wins-1-million/">WFXR.</a></em></p>

<p>As a result of Mr Foxx's win, the A1 Mini Mart, where he purchased the ticket, will receive a $10,000 bonus from the Virginia Lottery. When asked about his plans for the windfall, he chose to keep his intentions private.</p>

<aside>
<p>According to <em>WFXR-TV,</em> a Fox News affiliate, his win marks the fourth top prize awarded in the '20X the Money' game, indicating two remaining $1 million prizes yet to be claimed. The game features prizes ranging from $10 to $1 million.</p>

<p>The game offers impressive odds, with a 1 in 1,958,400 chance of winning the top prize and a 1 in 3.65 chance of winning any prize. Notably, every prize awarded by the Virginia Lottery benefits Virginia's K-12 public schools, supporting education statewide.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Talking of unexpected incidents,&nbsp;a 54-year-old woman in the US discovered she had won a staggering $207,199 (approximately Rs 1.73 crore) in the Second Chance online lottery games through an email that had landed in her Spam folder. Initially, the woman, who chose to remain anonymous, was sceptical about the email's authenticity, given its classification as junk mail. However, after verifying the information, she was thrilled to learn that her drawing entries had indeed secured her a significant prize.</p>

<p>According to the<em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/07/30/us-news/michigan-woman-learns-of-207199-lottery-prize-from-email-in-spam-folder/"> New York Post</a></em>, lottery officials confirmed the woman's win, highlighting the unexpected twist that led to her discovery of the life-changing news.&nbsp;</p>

       <description><![CDATA[His suspicions were raised when his bills seemed unusually high, despite his best efforts to reduce energy consumption.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a startling revelation, a resident of California discovered he had been footing the bill for his neighbour's electricity for over 15 years. According to&nbsp;<em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/california-man-discovers-paid-neighbors-electricity-bill-18/story?id=113850973">ABC News</a>,&nbsp;</em>Ken Wilson is a Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&amp;E) customer who has lived alone in an apartment complex in Vacaville since 2006. His suspicions were raised when his bills seemed unusually high, despite his best efforts to reduce energy consumption. An inquiry by the local power company uncovered the shocking mistake, exposing the 15-year mix-up that had Mr Wilson unknowingly shouldering the financial burden of his neighbour's electricity usage all along.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Before the discovery, Mr Wilson ha been taking proactive steps to reduce his soaring electricity bills by cutting back on usage and purchasing a device to track the wattage of his appliances. Despite these efforts, he noticed his meter bill continued to rise, even when his breaker was switched off.</p>

<p>''I've been trying to conserve electricity and lower my costs because it was getting really expensive. I kept going outside to check my meter… and I couldn't believe it. Even after I turned off my breakers, I kept going outside to check my meter to see if it was still running and it was still running,'' Mr Wilson told local TV station&nbsp;<a data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.kold.com/2024/09/17/man-discovers-hes-been-paying-wrong-utility-bill-up-18-years/">KMAX/KOVR</a>.</p>

<p>Suspicious, he contacted Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&amp;E) to investigate, presenting his findings and the measures he had taken to reduce usage. PG&amp;E launched an inquiry and ultimately confirmed his suspicions. Turns out, he had been inadvertently paying his neighbour's electricity bill since 2009, three years after moving into his apartment.</p>

<p>"Our preliminary investigation has found the meter number for the customer's apartment was being billed to another apartment since potentially 2009," a spokesperson for PG&amp;E said. ''We sincerely apologize for the oversight and regret any inconvenience caused by the duration of this issue,'' the spokesperson added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>PG&amp;E acknowledged and accepted responsibility for the mistake, assuring Mr Wilson that they would rectify the issue.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sri Lanka's election commission declared a previously fringe Marxist politician the country's president-elect on Sunday after a vote coloured by discontent over the island nation's response to an unprecedented financial crisis.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Anura Kumara Dissanayaka, the 55-year-old leader of the People's Liberation Front, won the presidency with 42.31 percent of the vote in Saturday's election, the commission said.</p>

<p>Opposition leader Sajith Premadasa took second place with 32.76 percent.</p>

<p>Outgoing President Ranil Wickremesinghe -- who took office at the peak of the 2022 economic collapse and imposed tough austerity policies per the terms of an IMF bailout -- took a distant third with 17.27 percent.</p>

<p>Wickremesinghe has yet to concede, but Foreign Minister Ali Sabry said it was clear that Dissanayaka had won.</p>

<p>"Though I heavily campaigned for President Ranil Wickremesinghe, the people of Sri Lanka have made their decision, and I fully respect their mandate for Anura Kumara Dissanayaka," Sabry said on social media.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dissanayaka will be sworn in on Monday morning at the colonial-era President Secretariat in Colombo, election commission officials said.</p>

<h3><strong>IMF deal</strong></h3>

<p>Economic issues dominated the eight-week campaign, with widespread public anger over the hardships endured since the peak of the crisis two years ago.</p>

<p>Dissanayaka would "not tear up" the IMF deal but would seek to modify it, a party politburo member told AFP.</p>

<p>"It is a binding document, but there is a provision to renegotiate," said Bimal Ratnayake.</p>

<p>He said Dissanayaka had pledged to reduce income taxes that were doubled by Wickremesinghe and slash sales taxes on food and medicines.</p>

<p>"We think we can get those reductions into the programme and continue with the four-year bailout programme," he said.</p>

<p>Dissanayaka's once-marginal Marxist party led two failed uprisings in the 1970s and 1980s that left more than 80,000 people dead.</p>

<p>It won less than four percent of the vote during the most recent parliamentary elections in 2020.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But Sri Lanka's crisis has proven an opportunity for Dissanayaka, who has seen a surge of support based on his pledge to change the island's "corrupt" political culture.</p>

<p>"Our country needs a new political culture," he said after casting his ballot on Saturday.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Around 76 percent of Sri Lanka's 17.1 million eligible voters cast ballots in Saturday's poll.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dissanayaka's party sought to reassure India that any administration he led would not be caught up in geopolitical rivalry between its northern neighbour and China, the country's largest lender.</p>

<p>New Delhi has expressed concerns over what it sees as Beijing's growing influence in Sri Lanka, which sits on vital shipping lanes criss-crossing the Indian Ocean.</p>

<p>"Sri Lankan territory will not be used against any other nation," Ratnayake told AFP.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We are fully aware of the geopolitical situation in our region, but we will not participate."</p>

<h3><strong>Austerity rejected</strong></h3>

<p>Wickremesinghe sought re-election to continue belt-tightening measures that stabilised the economy and ended months of food, fuel and medicine shortages during Sri Lanka's economic meltdown.</p>

<p>His two years in office restored calm to the streets after civil unrest spurred by the downturn saw thousands storm the compound of his predecessor Gotabaya Rajapaksa, who then fled the country.</p>

<p>But Wickremesinghe's tax hikes and other measures imposed under the $2.9 billion IMF bailout he secured last year left millions struggling to make ends meet.</p>

<p>Official data showed that Sri Lanka's poverty rate doubled to 25 percent between 2021 and 2022, adding more than 2.5 million people to those already living on less than $3.65 a day.</p>

<p>Thousands of police were deployed to keep watch over voting on Saturday.</p>

<p>A temporary curfew was imposed after polls closed, despite police reporting that there had been no violence during or after balloting.</p>

<p>No victory rallies or celebrations are permitted until a week after the final results are declared.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A tight security cordon has been laid around the Nassau Coliseum - the multi-purpose indoor arena in Uniondale, New York - where Prime Minister Narendra Modi will address a rally of the Indian diaspora on Sunday.</p>

<p>Federal, state, and local law enforcement have been put into service to provide full-proof security to the Prime Minister.</p>

<p>The Transportation Security Agency, which checks passengers at airports, is conducting a similar operation here, funnelling visitors through metal detectors, making them remove phones and metal objects, and checking their bags.</p>

<p>Secret Service officers conduct a secondary check with hand-held wands at some points.</p>

<p>The periphery of the Coliseum is fenced off and most entry points have been sealed off with Nassau County Police standing guard.</p>

<p>Inside, police and Secret Service officers stand guard at several points.</p>

<p>Several mounted police officers keep watch over the crowds and bomb-sniffing dogs are on patrol inside and outside.</p>

<p>Several hundred volunteers for the event guide visitors through the maze of the arena.</p>

<p>The media had to drop off their cameras and other equipment a day earlier to get them sanitised and those who hadn't were not allowed to bring in their equipment on Sunday.</p>

<p>The security has been heightened because of possible threats from extremist groups.</p>

<p>Some Sikh, Islamic, and other political organisations have said that they planned protests, but none are allowed at or near the Coliseum.</p>

<p>If they turn up they will be moved far away from the venue.</p>

<p>The tight security comes amidst heightened scrutiny of the safety arrangements for safety of leaders following the an attack on Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and another that was narrowly foiled.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US has handed over to India 297 antiquities during the visit of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. These antiquities were smuggled out of the country and were recovered. Trafficking of cultural property is a longstanding issue that has affected many cultures and countries throughout history, and India has been particularly hit.</p>

<p>"Deepening cultural connect and strengthening the fight against illicit trafficking of cultural properties. I am extremely grateful to President Biden and the US Government for ensuring the return of 297 invaluable antiquities to India," PM Modi said on X.</p>

<p>He thanked President Joe Biden for his support in the return of these artefacts. He noted that these objects were not just part of India's historical material culture, but formed the inner core of its civilisation and consciousness.</p>

<p>With this, the total number of ancient items recovered by India since 2014 has gone to 640, officials said, adding the number returned from the US alone will be 578. This is the maximum number of cultural artefacts returned by any country to India.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<ol>
	<li>PM Modi has already met some members of the Indian diaspora. After he arrived at Hotel Lotte Palace in New York, the diaspora members greeted with a dance performance to an Indian folk song, and chanted "Modi! Modi!"</li>
	<li>"He has brought the golden age of India back. Modi ji is great... This is a historical moment for us to cherish," a diaspora member said.</li>
	<li>An Indian community member whose painting PM Modi had signed told news agency ANI, "I met the PM today. It felt really good. The moment he saw my painting, he asked me where I come from. I told him I come from the Mithila region. The painting is based on the theme of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam," she said.</li>
	<li>PM Modi yesterday had three separate bilateral meetings with Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and US President Joe Biden.</li>
	<li>At the Quad Leadership Summit later and others associated with it, PM Modi underlined India's approach of cooperation, contact, and engagement for growth with a variety of partners in the Indo-Pacific, Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri told reporters in New York.</li>
	<li>With the US, a special feature of the bilateral meeting was the return of 297 antiquities to India, a few of which were on display at Mr Biden's home during the bilateral meeting.</li>
	<li>"In fact, the Prime Minister today referred to the Quad in a very, very evocative way. He called it quick unified assistance delivery (QUAD). The other members of the Quad said they finally understood what Quad signified and stood for," Mr Misri said.</li>
	<li>PM Modi also mentioned that at a time when the world is ridden with tensions and conflicts, the coming together of these four Quad partners with shared democratic values is important for humanity. He said the Quad was here to stay, to assist, to partner and to complement the efforts of the Indo-Pacific countries.</li>
	<li>Among the major announcements from the summit was the Quad Cancer Moonshot, which is a groundbreaking partnership to address the challenges posed by cancer and in this particular instance cervical cancer.</li>
	<li>There was discussion on many regional and global issues, and among them the need for the reform of the multilateral system of governance, including the United Nations Security Council (UNSC).</li>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An Israeli airstrike killed seven people in a school sheltering displaced families in Gaza City on Sunday, Palestinian health officials said, with the Israeli military saying it had targeted militants operating from the compound.</p>

<p>The strike hit Kafr Qasem School in Beach camp at around 11 a.m. (0800 GMT), the officials said. Among those killed was Majed Saleh, the director of the Hamas-run Public Works and Housing ministry, they added.</p>

<p>Israel's military said the strike targeted Hamas fighters there, and that it had used aerial surveillance and taken other steps to limit the risk to civilians.</p>

<p>Hamas, the Islamist militant group that rules Gaza, has regularly denied Israeli accusations that it uses hospitals and other civilians buildings for military purposes in the near year-old war.</p>

<p>The attack and other reported violence in Gaza came amid a surge of strikes further north between Israel and the Iran-backed forces of Hezbollah across the border with Lebanon - a parallel conflict that had stoked fears of wider regional unrest.</p>

<p>Six other Palestinians were killed in separate airstrikes in central and southern parts of Gaza, the medics said. They put the number of Palestinians killed in Israeli strikes so far on Sunday at 16.</p>

<p>In Rafah, near Gaza's border with Egypt, residents said Israeli tanks advanced towards the western parts of the city, where the army has operated since May, and took positions over some hilltops overseeing the coastal road.</p>

<p>Israel's demands to keep control of the southern border line between Rafah and Egypt have been a major sticking point in internationals effort to conclude a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas.</p>

<p>Hamas's armed wing said fighters have mounted several attacks against Israeli forces in Rafah, firing anti-tank rockets and detonating bombs in houses where Israeli troops had taken positions.</p>

<p>In a statement on Saturday, the Israeli military said forces, operating in Rafah since May, have killed dozens of militants in recent weeks and dismantled military infrastructure and tunnel shafts.</p>

<p>On Sunday, Gaza's health ministry warned that all services in all hospitals could halt in 10 days because of the shortages in essential spare parts, and oil needed to operate the fuel-powered generators.</p>

<p>Adding to the turmoil and misery, heavy rain flooded tent encampments overnight.</p>

<p>"Ten minutes of rain were enough to sink the tents. What if it rained all day? Tents are already worn out and can't stand winter," said Aya, displaced with her family in the central city of Deir Al-Balah, where around a million people are sheltering.</p>

<p>"We don't want new tents. We want the war to end. We don't want temporary solutions in hell," the 30-year-old told Reuters via a chat app.</p>

<p>More shelters and supplies to help people cope with the coming winter were needed, Juliette Touma, Director of Communications of the U.N. Palestinian refugee agency UNRWA, said.</p>

<p>"With rain and temperatures dropping, people are likely to fall ill especially children who are most vulnerable to colds and flu," Touma told Reuters.</p>

<p>This war in the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict was triggered on Oct. 7 when Hamas attacked Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking about 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.</p>

<p>Israel's subsequent assault on the enclave has killed more than 41,300 Palestinians, according to the local health ministry, and displaced nearly the entire 2.3 million-strong population.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

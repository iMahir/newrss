       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Four Indians, including a woman, have died in a massive crash involving five vehicles in US' Texas. The victims had connected through a carpooling app and were on their way to Bentonville in Arkansas on Friday when the tragedy struck. The crash led to a fire in the SUV they were in, and their bodies are charred. Authorities are relying on DNA testing to confirm the identities.</p>

<p>The victims have been identified as Aryan Raghunath Orampati, Farooq Shaik, Lokesh Palacharla, and Darshini Vasudevan. Orampati and his friend Shaik were returning after visiting his cousin in Dallas. Lokesh Palacharla was traveling to Bentonville to meet his wife. And Darshini Vasudevan, a Master's degree graduate from the University of Texas, was going to visit her uncle in Bentonville. They connected through a carpooling app and this helped authorities identify them.</p>

<p>Orampati's father Subhash Chandra Reddy owns a Hyderabad-based firm named Max Agri Genetics Private Limited. Aryan completed his engineering degree at Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham in Coimbatore. "His parents were in the US in May for his convocation at the University of Texas. After the convocation, they asked him to return to India, but he said he wanted to work in the US for two more years. Fate has struck like this," said a relative.</p>

<p>Orampati's friend Shaik, too, was from Hyderabad and lived in Bentonville. Darshini, from Tamil Nadu, was living in Frisco, Texas.</p>

<p>Farooq Shaik's father Masthan Vali said he went to the US three years back. "He went to the US to complete his MS degree. He finished it recently." Mr Vali is a retired private employee and the family lives in BHEL Hyderabad. "My daughter also lives in US and is handling the situation."</p>

<p>According to reports, five vehicles were involved in the tragic crash. A speeding truck rear-ended the SUV the victims were in. The car burst into flames and all the occupants burnt to death. Authorities are now relying on DNA fingerprinting and teeth and bone remains to confirm the identities. "DNA fingerprinting will be done to identify the bodies, and the samples will be matched with the parents," a local authority said.</p>

<p>A long weekend in the US has delayed the identification process, prolonging the suffering of the families crushed by the tragedy. Darshini Vasudevan's parents have appealing to External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar for help.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>During a live circus performance, Russian trainer Sergei Prichinich narrowly escaped death when a female brown bear named Donut, weighing over 490 pounds, suddenly attacked him. The horrified audience, filled with parents and children, watched in terror as the bear, who was riding a hoverboard as part of her act, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://x.com/peta/status/1829184288254001297">viciously attacked Mr Prichinich</a>, pinning him to the ground for approximately half a minute, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/09/03/world-news/angry-bear-attacks-circus-trainer-in-front-of-terrified-crowd/" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>New York Post</em> </a>reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, he desperately tried to defend himself, holding a bar between the bear's jaws and his body. Just as the situation seemed dire, a worker outside the cage intervened, jabbing at the bear and distracting her long enough for Prichinich to break free. The bear backed off, giving Prichinich a narrow escape from the terrifying ordeal.</p>

<p>Nikita Mikhailov, director of the Moretti Circus, confirmed that the show resumed without further incident after the horrific episode.&nbsp;</p>

<p>''Towards the end of the act, the bear snapped at Sergei and wrestled with him. Their performance continued,'' he said. He noted that the tamer ''waited for the bear to calm down, got up, continued the routine with her, sealed it with a kiss, and that was it.''&nbsp;</p>

<p>He also praised Mr Prichinich for his quick thinking and professional handling of the situation.&nbsp;''This is an animal, and they can behave differently, they may not like something, but they can express their emotions this way. Every trainer understands this,'' Mr Mikhailov added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While everyone was relieved that the trainer escaped unhurt, Russian animal rights activist Yuri Koretskikh renewed his calls for a complete ban on live animal performances, citing the inherent risks and dangers posed to humans and animals in such shows.</p>

<p>''While modern world circus art is rapidly moving towards humanity, banning the use of animals in circuses, the Russian circus lobby is actively resisting progress, defending its commercial interests,” Mr Koretskikh said.</p>

<p>In Russia, animal rights have been a pressing concern, prompting President Vladimir Putin to sign a bill outlawing animal cruelty in 2018. Although the legislation doesn't address animal performance, activists have continued to focus on this issue. Last year, the Russian Duma proposed a bill to prohibit the use of animals in circuses nationwide. The bill is set to be presented to the lower chamber in October.&nbsp;</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Australia's air safety investigators have recommended reforms after a Brisbane air traffic controller was found asleep at his desk while covering an early-morning shift. According to a report by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB), the staffer was managing the Cairns Terminal Control Unit (TCU) from Airservices Australia's Brisbane office when he was discovered asleep by the oncoming air traffic controller who was working the day shift. The incident took place in December 2022. In its report, released Tuesday, the ATSB blamed multiple consecutive night shifts and an ineffective fatigue risk management system for the incident.</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.atsb.gov.au/media/news-items/2024/fatigue-management-improvements-underway-after-brisbane-centre-controller-found-asleep-end-their-night-shift" rel="noindex, nofollow">ATSB</a>, the staffer was found lying across two chairs and under a blanket at the end of a night shift. The employee had worked their seventh night shift in nine days as an approach controller for Cairns airport from the Brisbane control centre, with the shift starting at 10 pm and running until 6 am. The staffer had completed 10 night shifts in 12 days. The report stated that there were no planes in the area at the time and ATSB was unable to determine when the employee went to sleep.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sharing the investigation report details on X, ATSB wrote, "A Brisbane Centre air traffic controller who was found asleep at their workstation towards the end of their shift had worked multiple consecutive night shifts resulting in sleep debt, an ATSB investigation report details."&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">A Brisbane Centre air traffic controller who was found asleep at their workstation towards the end of their shift had worked multiple consecutive night shifts resulting in sleep debt, an ATSB investigation report details.</p>
— ATSB (@atsbgovau) <a href="https://twitter.com/atsbgovau/status/1830791268907278639?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 3, 2024</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>According to the press note, ATSB Chief Commissioner Angus Mitchell said there were several factors contributing to the staffer falling asleep on the job but stressed the staffer's fatigue was a key component as they had worked 10-night shifts in the previous 12 days.</p>

<p>"The controller had also been working multiple night shifts with reduced extended rest periods, which likely reduced their ability to obtain restorative sleep," Mr Mitchell said.</p>

<p>Alongside the staffer's fatigue, the ATSB noted the time of day the controller was working, the low workload in a night shift, the employee not undertaking mental alertness activities and lying down on two chairs under a blanket. It also said that the controller may have experienced "sleep inertia" after waking up, impacting their ability to communicate and make decisions during an instance where traffic infringes on their airspace.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"There were no negative consequences from this occurrence, but it does highlight areas for improvement in work scheduling and fatigue risk management," said Mr Mitchell.</p>

<p>The ATSB report further criticised an "over-reliance" on short-term changes to manage the airport roster "likely due to an underlying lack of resources within Airservices Australia". "As a result, cumulative fatigue was not being effectively managed strategically, and an over-reliance on tactical principles did not identify or manage fatigue risks arising from the work schedule," it added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, after the incident, Airservices upped its overall number of air traffic controllers, the Guardian reported. The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also announced changes to its fatigue risk management system requirement and is working alongside Airservices to bolster its approach to staffer fatigue.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mr Mitchell called on other sectors of the transport industry to put the spotlight on fatigue as a danger in the workplace. "Fatigue remains one of the most relevant ongoing concerns for safe transport, despite increased awareness across the transport sector," he said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US Commerce Department said Tuesday it plans to award $50 million to HP to support the expansion and modernization of an existing company facility in Oregon that will boost key semiconductor technologies.</p>

<p>The proposed funding will support technologies that serve life sciences instrumentation and technology hardware used in artificial intelligence applications and other projects, the department said.</p>

<p>Congress in August 2022 approved a $39 billion subsidy program for U.S. semiconductor manufacturing and related components along with $75 billion in government lending authority and a 25% investment tax credit worth an estimated $24 billion.</p>

<p>The projects build on HP's expertise in microfluidics and microelectromechanical systems with funding set to support manufacturing of silicon devices critical in life sciences lab equipment used in drug discovery, singlecell research, and cell line development.</p>

<p>Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said the proposed $50 million funding for the Corvallis, Oregon, HP campus "shows how we are investing in every part of the semiconductor supply chain and how important semiconductor technology is to innovation in drug discovery and critical life science equipment."</p>

<p>The department said the technology will boost partner institutions including Harvard Medical School, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Merck.</p>

<p>HP CEO Enrique Lores said the funding "provides HP with an opportunity to modernize and expand our facility to further invest in our microfluidics technology."</p>

<p>The department has announced term sheets with 17 companies offering more than $32 billion in grants and up to $29 billion in loans.</p>

<p>It also made other major planned awards including $6.4 billion to South Korea's Samsung to expand chip production in Texas.</p>

<p>Intel won $8.5 billion in grants in March while Taiwan's TSMC clinched $6.6 billion to build out its American production and memory chip maker Micron Technology won $6.1 billion to help fund domestic chip factory projects.</p>

<p>All the awards have yet to be finalized and amounts could change after the Commerce Department conducts due diligence.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Henry, the crocodile, got his name from the famous hunter, Sir Henry Neumann, who was once appointed to kill him. ]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An enormous 16ft beast weighing 700 kg and fathering thousands of hatchlings is now recognised as the world's oldest crocodile. Meet Henry, the man-eating Nile crocodile, who at 123 years old has sired over 10,000 babies with his six ‘wives,' according to the zoo where he lives.<br />
<br />
Henry's journey began in the Okavango Delta, Botswana, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, where he was born on December 16, 1900, as per the Sun. Renowned for his terrifying fang-like teeth and massive frame, Henry is now believed to be the largest living crocodile, with a length that almost matches a minibus. However, his past is far from ordinary.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
In the early 1900s, Henry developed a notorious reputation among the local tribes in Botswana, where he allegedly preyed on human children. The tribes, desperate to end his bloodthirsty reign, sought the help of a famed hunter, Sir Henry Neumann, after whom the crocodile was named. Rather than killing the beast, Mr Neumann captured Henry, sentencing him to a lifetime of captivity.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
For the past three decades, Henry has lived at the Crocworld Conservation Centre in Scottburgh, South Africa. There, he continues to awe visitors with his size and age, making him one of the oldest crocodiles in captivity. His dark, man-eating past is a stark contrast to his current life as a zoo attraction, where he is admired from a safe distance.<br />
<br />
Henry is a Nile crocodile, a species found in 26 countries across Sub-Saharan Africa. These apex predators, known for their fierce nature, are responsible for hundreds of deaths in the region each year.<br />
<br />
While Henry is the oldest crocodile, the largest belongs to Cassius, a 16 ft saltwater crocodile living in Australia. Cassius, captured in 1984, has become a star attraction at the Marineland Melanesia Crocodile Habitat on Green Island, off the coast of Queensland.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At least six Ukrainian officials including cabinet ministers submitted their resignation on Tuesday and a presidential aide was dismissed, as the ruling party signalled a major government reshuffle was underway.</p>

<p>The reset comes as Kyiv faces growing challenges including daily Russian bombardment and as President Volodymyr Zelensky seeks to boost confidence in the government two and a half years into Moscow's invasion.</p>

<p>"As promised, a major government reset can be expected this week. More than 50 percent of the Cabinet of Ministers' staff will be changed," David Arakhamia, the head of the ruling Servant of the People party's parliamentary faction wrote on Telegram.</p>

<p>"Tomorrow we will have a day of dismissals, and the day after that a day of appointments," he said.</p>

<p>Several Ukrainian ministers had already submitted their resignation by Tuesday evening, including the Minister for Strategic Industries, Minister for Justice and Minister of Environmental Protection.</p>

<p>The head of Ukraine's State Property Fund, Vitaliy Koval, also resigned, as did Deputy Prime Ministers Iryna Vereshchuk and Olga Stefanishyna.</p>

<p>The deputy head of Zelensky's office and one of the president's top aides, Rostyslav Shurma, was meanwhile dismissed, according to a presidential decree.</p>

<p>Zelensky has ordered several reshuffles since the war began, sacking his defence minister last September after a series of corruption scandals and more recently replacing his top commander amid setbacks on the battlefield.</p>

<p>The Ukrainian leader's first presidential term, which began in 2019, expired in May but he has remained in post under martial law.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A California doctor and a woman charged with illegally supplying the drug ketamine to "Friends" star Matthew Perry before his overdose death will face trial in March, according to court documents released on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Dr. Salvador Plasencia, and Jasveen Sangha, whom authorities said was a drug dealer known to customers as the "ketamine queen," have pleaded not guilty to charges related to the October 2023 death of Perry.</p>

<p>An autopsy determined that the 54-year-old died from "acute effects" of ketamine and other factors that caused him to lose consciousness and drown in his hot tub.</p>

<p>Ketamine is a short-acting anesthetic with hallucinogenic properties, sometimes prescribed to treat depression and anxiety but also abused by recreational users.</p>

<p>Perry had publicly acknowledged decades of substance abuse, including during the years he starred as Chandler Bing on the hit 1990s television sitcom "Friends."</p>

<p>Plasencia and Sangha are scheduled be tried together in federal court in Los Angeles starting on March 4.</p>

<p>Three other defendants have agreed to plead guilty in connection with Perry's death.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United States has charged leaders of the armed Palestinian group Hamas with a raft of "terrorism" offenses, federal court documents unsealed on Tuesday revealed.</p>

<p>Six men -- including Hamas chief Yahya Sinwar and late political leader Ismail Haniyeh, who was killed in late July in Tehran -- were named in the charging document dated February 1, accused of "conspiracy to provide material support for acts of terrorism resulting in death" along with six other counts.</p>

<p>The document also contained a request for the arrest of the individuals.</p>

<p>Hamas, which is designated a "terrorist organization" by Washington, launched an unprecedented attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, triggering the brutal ongoing war in the Gaza Strip, which is controlled by the Palestinian group.</p>

<p>"The charges unsealed today are just one part of our effort to target every aspect of Hamas's operations. These actions will not be our last," US Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement.</p>

<p>"Yahya Sinwar and the other senior leaders of Hamas are charged today with orchestrating this terrorist organization's decades-long campaign of mass violence and terror -- including on October 7th."</p>

<p>Israel's campaign against Hamas has so far killed at least 40,819 people in Gaza, according to the territory's health ministry. The UN rights office says most of the dead are women and children.</p>

<p>The October 7 attack on Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,205 people, mostly civilians and including hostages killed in captivity, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Airbnb on Tuesday asked New York City to reconsider regulations on short-term rentals that went into effect in September 2023, citing higher prices for travelers and zero impact on the housing market.</p>

<p>In a blog post, Airbnb said Local Law LL18, which states hosts must be permanent occupants of the units being rented and must register with the city before posting rentals, has "failed to combat the housing crisis".</p>

<p>After the implementation of the law, the number of Airbnb listings allowing stays under 30 nights has fallen 83%, according to an August report by data analytics firm Airdna.</p>

<p>Airbnb, citing data from Apartment List, said vacancy rates for apartments in New York City have remained virtually unchanged at 3.4% since the law took effect.</p>

<p>The company also said the cost of travel has increased. Hotel rates in New York City were up 7.4% year-over-year in July, compared with 2.1% across the U.S., according to data from Co-Star, Airbnb said.</p>

<p>"By rolling back parts of the law, the city can increase the supply of accommodations for consumers, support resident hosts and revitalize local businesses that depend on tourism dollars," Airbnb added.</p>

<p>The New York City mayor's office and the Office of Special Enforcement were not immediately available for comment.</p>

<p>Last year, a New York judge dismissed the company's lawsuit against New York City over the local law.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump is to plead not guilty to the charges in a revised indictment accusing him of seeking to overturn the results of the 2020 US presidential election, according to a court filing on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Trump, in a filing with the US District Court in Washington, waived his right to be present at his arraignment on the charges and instructed his attorneys to plead not guilty.</p>

<p>Special Counsel Jack Smith filed a new indictment of the Republican White House candidate last week on the charges that he tried to subvert the results of the election he lost to Democrat Joe Biden.</p>

<p>The superseding indictment retains the same four charges against Trump as in an earlier version but takes into account a recent Supreme Court ruling that a former president has broad immunity from criminal prosecution.</p>

<p>District Judge Tanya Chutkan granted Trump's request not to appear in person at the arraignment and said it will be held at the same time as a status conference in the case on Thursday.</p>

<p>The new indictment of the 78-year-old Trump removes material affected by the presidential immunity ruling from the conservative-dominated top court.</p>

<p>It retains the same core, stating that Trump lost in 2020 but "was determined to remain in power" and attempted to subvert the results.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court ruled in July that an ex-president has broad immunity from prosecution for official acts conducted while in office, but can be pursued for unofficial acts.</p>

<p>Trump's lawyers have been seeking to delay a trial until after November's election between Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential candidate.</p>

<p>Trump is accused of conspiracy to defraud the United States and conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding -- the January 6, 2021, joint session of Congress that was attacked by Trump supporters.</p>

<p>Trump is also accused of seeking to disenfranchise US voters with his campaign of false claims that he won the 2020 election.</p>

<p>He was originally scheduled to go on trial on March 4, but that was put on hold while his lawyers pushed his claim of presidential immunity all the way up to the Supreme Court.</p>

<p>Trump was convicted in New York in May of 34 counts of falsifying business records to cover up hush money payments made to porn star Stormy Daniels.</p>

<p>Sentencing has been scheduled for September 18.</p>

<p>Trump also faces charges in Georgia related to efforts to overturn the 2020 election.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A former aide to New York Governor Kathy Hochul has been arrested today and charged with acting as an undisclosed agent of China, federal prosecutors in Brooklyn said.</p>

<p>Linda Sun had served as the deputy chief of staff to Ms Hochul for a year. The 41-year-old has also been accused of visa fraud, alien smuggling and money laundering conspiracy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is alleged that while working in the state government, Ms Sun blocked Taiwanese government's representatives from meeting officials and sought to organise a high-level New York state official's visit to China.</p>

<p>"In return for these and other actions, Ms Sun received substantial economic and other benefits from representatives of the People's Republic of China (PRC) government and the Chinese Communist Party," the US Attorney's Office said in a press release.</p>

<p>Her husband Chris Hu has also been arrested. The prosecutors said the Chinese government facilitated millions of dollars in transactions for Mr Hu, who carried out business activities in China.</p>

<p>Ms Sun also received several gifts, including Nanjing-style salted ducks prepared by a Chinese government official's chef, prosecutors added.</p>

<p>Ms Sun and Mr Hu laundered the proceeds of their scheme to purchase a $4.1 million property in New York, a $2.1 million condominium in Hawaii and various luxury automobiles, including a 2024 Ferrari, the US Attorney's Office said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said on Tuesday the 2025 state budget will feature steep spending cuts as the government tries to balance fiscal responsibility with a need to finance Israel's ongoing war with Hamas in Gaza.</p>

<p>The minister has been under pressure from the Bank of Israel and investors seeking clarity on fiscal policy for next year. The central bank has been calling for spending cuts and tax hikes or other ways to bring in more revenue. But Smotrich has said that during a war it was wrong to raise taxes.</p>

<p>Speaking at a news conference, Smotrich outlined only his main focus points while formulating the budget, which he said would be ready for a cabinet vote in early October and an initial parliamentary vote in mid-November. Full approval by lawmakers would be at the end of December, he said.</p>

<p>"We are in the longest and most expensive war in Israel's history with expenses of 200 to 250 billion shekels ($54-$68 billion)," Smotrich said.</p>

<p>"We are not limiting war spending and we will support the war effort until victory," he said. "Without victory, there will not be security and without security, there will be no economy."</p>

<p>The war, triggered by Hamas attacks on Israel, has raged since October 7 with little signs of a near-term ceasefire.</p>

<p>To finance the war, Smotrich plans broad spending reductions of 35 billion shekels in 2025, along with a freeze in tax rates, benefits and wages. He sees a budget deficit of 4% of gross domestic product, down from a 6.6% of GDP target in 2024.</p>

<p>The deficit reached 8.1% in July and is expected to grow further in August but Smotrich said it will come back to its target by year end.</p>

<p>Three credit rating agencies lowered Israel's credit rating this year and Smotrich has also been accused of not managing the economy well with scant growth of 1.2% in the second quarter.</p>

<p>Smotrich said the shekel was far stronger than prior to the war, the stock market was doing well and high tech investments have recovered, with the jobless rate at 2.8%.</p>

<p>A rise in inflation to 3.2% was temporary, and mainly due to supply factors stemming from the war, he said.</p>

<p>An economic plan accompanying the budget will include support for the high-tech sector, a streamlining of the public sector, measures to fight tax evasion and a diversification of capital sources.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Despite Tan's dissatisfaction with his children and his belief that Gu and his family provided better support, his request to reclaim the property was denied by the court.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After remarrying at the age of 93, a man from Shanghai regretted his decision to sign a contract giving his flat to a coworker in exchange for care and companionship. The man, whose last name is Tan, went to court with his former care giver and coworker, Gu, but his request to get his property restored was denied, according to the <em>South China Morning Post.</em></p>

<p>Tan and Gu's family formed a support arrangement in 2005, when Tan promised to give them his flat in return for their company and attention. His demands included regular phone calls from Gu and his family, a weekly visit, grocery and clothing purchases, and taking care of him while he was ill. In return, Tan wrote in his will that he would bequeath his flat and its contents to Gu instead of his children, the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scmp.com/news/people-culture/trending-china/article/3276830/china-man-agreed-gift-home-colleague-companionship-changes-mind-after-remarriage-93?module=top_story&amp;pgtype=section"><em>SCMP reported.</em></a></p>

<p>"They cared about me more than my family. They helped me get through illness and pain and made my life rich and happy," Tan wrote.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/outcry-in-china-after-women-lock-crying-child-in-plane-toilet-to-educate-her-6450292"><strong>Also Read | Outcry In China After Women Lock Crying Child In Plane Toilet To "Educate Her"</strong></a><br />
<br />
Tan said he was not on good terms with his children, who he felt had not fulfilled the duty of support.</p>

<p>Tan also signed a purchase contract with Gu in 2005, selling his flat to Gu for 200,000 yuan (US$28,000). The size of the unit was not revealed in the report.</p>

<p>The average housing price in Shanghai in 2005 was 6,700 yuan per square meter, according to the Shanghai Statistics Bureau.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Islamic State group claimed on Tuesday a suicide attack in the Afghan capital that killed six people a day earlier, saying it had targeted the Taliban government's prosecution service.</p>

<p>The explosion in Kabul's southern outskirts on Monday afternoon killed at least six people and wounded 13 more, according to the city's police.</p>

<p>The IS group's Amaq media wing said in a statement on the Telegram messaging app that "the suicide bomber waited until the time when the prosecutor's employees were leaving their shifts" before detonating in the middle of a crowd.</p>

<p>It put the combined figure of dead and wounded at "more than 45" and said the bombing was committed "to avenge Muslims held in Taliban prisons".</p>

<p>Afghanistan's Taliban authorities have declared security their highest priority since surging back to power following the chaotic withdrawal of US-led foreign forces three years ago.</p>

<p>While their sweeping security operations have led to a decline in militants challenging their rule, according to analysts, the regional IS chapter known as Islamic State Khorasan (IS-K) remains a threat.</p>

<p>The group has targeted Taliban government ministries, foreign embassies and religious minorities.</p>

<p>The previous suicide attack in Afghanistan claimed by IS-K was in the southern city of Kandahar -- the Taliban's historic stronghold -- in March.</p>

<p>Taliban authorities said only three people were killed in that attack, while a hospital source put the toll at 20. Such discrepancies are not uncommon.</p>

<p>Taliban government spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid told AFP last month that IS "existed here before but we suppressed them very hard".</p>

<p>"No such groups exist here that can pose a threat to anyone," he said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a case that has outraged people across France, the man who drugged his wife and invited more than 50 strangers to rape her, also photographed his daughter naked after she was drugged, according to the Daily Mail.</p>

<p>While going through Dominique P's computer, the police found a folder titled 'My Daughter Naked', Judge Roger Arata revealed in court.</p>

<p>As the judge made the revelation, the daughter broke down, started shaking uncontrollably, and had to be helped out of the courtroom in Avignon, according to the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-13807687/Daughter-man-let-50-men-rape-unconscious-wife-breaks-flees-court-trial-hears-photographed-drugged-file-computer-named-Daughter-Naked.html" rel="No follow, no index" target="_blank">Daily Mail.</a></p>

<p>Just as he did with his wife, Dominique gave his daughter tranquilisers and after she fell unconscious, he partially dressed her in her mother's clothes and photographed her. The pictures were taken at their family home near Paris in 2013.</p>

<p>The shocking revelation comes after the trial of the 71-year-old accused, along with 50 other men began on Monday. He is accused of drugging his 72-year-old wife and getting her raped when she passed out. This happened on multiple occasions for over a decade. He also film the abuse when the strangers raped her. They each face up to 20 years in prison if found guilty.</p>

<p>He has also been charged in a 1991 rape and murder case as well as for attempted rape in 1999.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Canada is closing its doors to more visitors and temporary residents by approving fewer visas and turning away more people who reach its borders with official documents, according to government data obtained by Reuters.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>The spike in rejections of foreign travellers comes as Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Liberal government, trailing in polls ahead of an election expected next year, tries to lower the numbers of temporary residents - and possibly permanent immigrants. Migrants have been blamed for the shortage and high prices of housing.</p>

<p>Canadians have prided themselves on embracing newcomers but polls show a growing number say Canada is admitting too many immigrants. That stance is filtering down to border and immigration officers, observers say.</p>

<p>In July, Canada refused entry to 5,853 foreign travellers, who were "allowed to leave," as Canada puts it, and who include students, workers and tourists, the most since at least January 2019, according to border agency data that has not been previously reported.</p>

<p>Border officers turned away 3,727 foreign travellers per month on average through the first seven months of 2024, an increase of 633 people or 20% from a year earlier.</p>

<p>Separately, officers deemed 285 visa-holders inadmissible in July, also the most in any month since at least January 2019, the data showed.</p>

<p>A Canada Border Services Agency spokesperson said changes in findings of inadmissibility can be caused by migration patterns or policy changes and are decided case by case. CBSA did not identify any specific policy changes.</p>

<p>"The CBSA's role, policy, and practice has always been to assess the admissibility of persons coming to Canada. This has not changed," the spokesperson said.</p>

<p>At the same time, Canada's immigration department is approving fewer visas.</p>

<p>The ratio of refused visitor visa applications to approved ones was higher in June than at any point since the height of the pandemic. In January, February, May and June 2024, more applications were refused than approved, according to immigration department data.</p>

<p>The number of approved study and work permits also dropped from multi-year highs in 2023 and 2022, respectively.</p>

<p>"Canadians want a system that is not out of control," Immigration Minister Marc Miller said in August.</p>

<p>Miller's spokesperson said the immigration department was "committed to a fair and non-discriminatory application of immigration policy and procedures" and attributed the drop in study-permit approvals to a cap announced in January. The decline appears to have begun last year, however.</p>

<p>Eight lawyers told Reuters they have heard from clients of greater scrutiny of visa-holders at airports and land border crossings.</p>

<p>British Columbia lawyer Will Tao said he has represented half a dozen visa-holders who border officials disbelieved about the nature of their plans in Canada and suggested they turn back voluntarily or risk deportation. Some did so, not knowing the implications this could have for their visa or travel authorization, including potential cancellation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>Tao sees increased border officer skepticism stemming from a "180-degree" attitude shift on immigration from the government. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The idea that foreigners are entering Canada without meeting requirements, or are causing the country harm, is trickling down from politicians to front-line officials, he added.</p>

<p><strong>'YOUR TEMPORARY RESIDENT VISA IS NO LONGER VALID'</strong></p>

<p>Mohammed Kamil Shaibu was paged while waiting to board a connecting flight from Paris to Toronto last September on his way to a conference in Edmonton.</p>

<p>The Ghanaian was told a Canadian immigration officer wanted to talk to him. He was then quizzed over the phone about his employment, the purpose of his trip and any assistance he had received in filing his tourist visa application.</p>

<p>"I had trouble answering," he said in an interview. "I was so terrified. I don't even know what I said."</p>

<p>Shaibu was told he would not be going to Canada. Instead, he was asked to return to Accra.</p>

<p>"Your temporary-resident visa is no longer valid for travel to Canada," reads an email reviewed by Reuters that Shaibu received that day from the immigration department.</p>

<p>Canada should not grant visas it does not plan to honor, said University of Calgary assistant law professor Gideon Christian.</p>

<p>"Why accept people if, when they come, you're not going to admit them?"</p>

<p>Shaibu says his experience has not soured him on Canada.</p>

<p>"I know Canada is a very nice place made up of very nice and accommodating and hospitable people."</p>

<p>He says he may even try again to visit one day.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[An engine failure on Cathay Pacific's A350 flight has raised concerns about Rolls-Royce, the manufacturer responsible for the aircraft's engines.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The British manufacturer Rolls-Royce, which makes and maintains the engines for the Airbus A350, has come under scrutiny following an engine failure on Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific Airways aircraft from Hong Kong on Monday.</p>

<p>Investors are trying to determine whether this incident could have larger implications for Rolls-Royce as airlines that operate the twin-aisle A350 start conducting fleet inspections. The A350 is mostly used for long-haul flights and can accommodate up to 410 passengers.</p>

<p><strong>What Went Wrong on the Flight?</strong></p>

<p>According to a <em>Reuters</em> report, a problem unfolded several minutes after take-off on flight CX383 from Hong Kong to Zurich on Monday, according to flight tracking service FlightRadar24. The five-year-old A350-1000 plane performed two wide circles and dumped fuel over the sea before returning to Hong Kong, where it landed safely about 75 minutes after its departure. Cathay Pacific said it identified an engine component failure after the aircraft returned to Hong Kong.</p>

<p>Cathay Pacific has not specified which engine component failed, but the carrier said it was the "first of its type to suffer such failure on any A350 aircraft worldwide." A person familiar with the matter told Reuters the incident involved a problem with a fuel nozzle inside a XWB-97 engine, the Rolls-Royce model used on the A350-1000. Now 15 jets need a replacement part. The airline has already had to cancel 34 return flights.</p>

<p><strong>What Could The Implications Be For Rolls-Royce?</strong></p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/sep/03/what-happened-to-cathay-pacifics-a350-and-how-will-it-affect-rolls-royce"><em>The Guardian</em></a>, the key question for Rolls-Royce is: how widespread is the problem? The company that makes the engines in Derby earns much of its money from fees related to engine flying hours, so groundings can be costly.</p>

<p>Tufan Erginbilgic, Rolls-Royce's chief executive, has overseen an astonishing appreciation in the company's market value - up nearly fivefold to 39 billion pounds - since taking over at the start of 2023. As well as cutting management jobs, he has achieved this increase in part by charging airline customers more. However, these customers might baulk at the rising charges if their engines are out of service for long periods. The company highlighted the Cathay statements that it had secured the spare parts and that repairs could be completed quickly, without needing to remove the engines entirely.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi today visited the renowned Omar Ali Saifuddien Mosque in Brunei, during his two-day visit to the nation. His visit to Brunei is aimed at bolstering bilateral ties between the two countries.</p>

<p>PM Modi's visit to the mosque, considered one of the most iconic structures in the region, came shortly after the inauguration of a new Chancery of the Indian High Commission.</p>

<p>The Omar Ali Saifuddien Mosque is named after the 28th Sultan of Brunei - the father of the current Sultan, Haji Hassanal Bolkiah, and is considered as the Architect of Modern Brunei.</p>

</div>

<p>PM Modi also interacted with the local officials, scholars and members of the Indian community who had gathered in large numbers.</p>

<p>The new Chancery of the Indian High Commission in Brunei was launched by Prime Minister Modi to a rousing welcome by members of the Indian community. The new facility, which has come up at the Jalan Duta Diplomatic Enclave, is adjacent to the US Embassy in Bandar Seri Begawan.</p>

<p>External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar and National Security Adviser (NSA) Ajit Doval were present on the occasion as the PM lit a lamp and unveiled a plaque at the launch.</p>

<p>After the launch, The Prime Minister's Office said in a statement that "The chancery complex embodies a profound sense of Indianness, masterfully integrating traditional motifs and lush tree plantations. The use of elegant claddings and durable Kota stones further enhances its aesthetic appeal, harmoniously blending classic and contemporary elements. The design not only pays homage to India's rich cultural heritage but also creates a tranquil and inviting atmosphere."</p>

<p>PM Modi arrived at the Bandar Seri Begawan Airport Tuesday afternoon as he began his two-day visit to Brunei Darussalam - the first-ever bilateral trip by an Indian PM to the southeast Asian nation - at the invitation of Sultan Haji Hassanal Bolkiah.</p>

<p>The historic visit of the Prime Minister coincides with the 40th anniversary of establishment of diplomatic ties between India and Brunei.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is no link between mobile phone use and increased brain cancer risk, according to a new World Health Organization-commissioned review of the available published evidence worldwide.</p>

<p>Despite the huge rise in the use of wireless technology, there has not been a corresponding rise in the incidence of brain cancers, the review, published on Tuesday, found. That applies even to people who make long phone calls or those who have used mobile phones for more than a decade.</p>

<p>The final analysis included 63 studies from 1994-2022, assessed by 11 investigators from 10 countries, including the Australian government's radiation protection authority.</p>

<p>The work assessed the effects of radiofrequency, used in mobile phones as well as TV, baby monitors and radar, co-author Mark Elwood, professor of cancer epidemiology at the University of Auckland, New Zealand, said.</p>

<p>"None of the major questions studied showed increased risks," he said. The review looked at cancers of the brain in adults and children, as well as cancer of the pituitary gland, salivary glands and leukemias, and risks linked to mobile phone use, base stations, or transmitters, as well as occupational exposure. Other cancer types will be reported separately.</p>

<p>The review follows other similar work. The WHO and other international health bodies have said previously there is no definitive evidence of adverse health effects from the radiation used by mobile phones, but called for more research. It is currently classified as "possibly carcinogenic", or class 2B, by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), a category used when the agency cannot rule out a potential link.</p>

<p>The agency's advisory group has called for the classification to be re-evaluated as soon as possible given the new data since its last assessment in 2011.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Swiss industrialist Pankaj Oswal filed an appeal with the United Nations against the alleged illegal detention of his 26-year-old daughter in Uganda.</p>

<p>Vasundhara Oswal was seized by around 20 armed men, who did not produce an identification or warrant, from Oswal's&nbsp;extra-neutral alcohol (ENA) plant in Uganda. While she was detained on October 1, purportedly in a missing man's case, an&nbsp;urgent appeal to the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention (WGAD) was filed earlier this week.</p>

<p>A post on Vasundhara's Instagram handle detailed her "unlawful detainment and arrest", showing a toilet with blood and faeces on the floor. The post claimed that she forced to sit in a room full of shoes for over 90 hours, and not allowed to bathe or change her clothes for nearly five days.&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman was denied basic necessities, like clean water and proper food,&nbsp;given a small bench to sleep on, and made to participate in a suspect parade.</p>

<p>Another <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.instagram.com/vasundharaoswal/p/DA57taIoULM/?img_index=1">post on her Instagram handle quoted her brother</a> as describing Vasundhara as a "workaholic", who developed the $110 million ENA plant in Uganda's Luwero from "a small tent on a bare land in 2021". He said her detention was a result of corporate jealousy of an unnamed 68-year-old man, whom he charged with an attempt to extort the Oswal money and drown her reputation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Vasundhara's brother further claimed that the authorities did not release her despite a court order, and instead took her to a look court where she was charged with murder.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a startling admission during a public inquiry on Wednesday, Canadian Prime Minister <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/as-we-had-said-no-evidence-whatsoever-india-on-justin-trudeaus-deposition-6806506">Justin Trudeau</a> admitted that Canada had no "hard evidentiary proof" to support allegations linking Indian government agents to the killing of Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar last year. Mr Trudeau's testimony came amid heightened diplomatic tensions between India and Canada, which escalated following these accusations in 2023.</p>

<p>Speaking during a public inquiry into alleged foreign interference in Canada's federal electoral processes and democratic institutions, Mr Trudeau revealed that his claims about India's involvement were based on intelligence rather than conclusive evidence.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I was briefed on the fact that there was intelligence from Canada, and possibly from Five Eyes allies that made it fairly clear, incredibly clear, that India was involved in this... Agents of the government of India were involved in the killing of a Canadian on Canadian soil," he said.</p>

<p>The Five Eyes network, comprising Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand, focuses on surveillance and signals intelligence (SIGINT). According to Mr Trudeau, the information presented was alarming enough for the Canadian government to take seriously.</p>

<p>Mr Trudeau alleged that Indian diplomats were engaged in gathering information on Canadians who were critical of the Modi government, with this data reportedly being passed to senior Indian officials and criminal organizations, including the Lawrence Bishnoi gang. The Bishnoi gang, notorious for its involvement in organised crime, has been linked by Canadian authorities to violence targeting the South Asian community, specifically pro-Khalistani activists in Canada.</p>

<p>Nijjar, a designated terrorist by India's National Investigation Agency in 2020, was shot dead outside a gurdwara in Surrey, British Columbia, in June 2023. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) later stated that six Indian diplomats were allegedly part of a plot to murder Nijjar. The Canadian Police also suggested that the Bishnoi gang was connected to Indian government agents.</p>

<p>Mr Trudeau explained that Canada had the option to go public with the allegations during the G20 summit held in New Delhi in September 2023 but chose not to.</p>

<p>"Our response was, well, it's within your security agencies," Mr Trudeau said, recounting Canada's exchanges with India. "At that point, it was primarily intelligence, not hard evidentiary proof. So we said, let's work together and look into your security services."</p>

<p>Mr Trudeau added that he confronted Prime Minister Narendra Modi during the G20 summit, claiming that Canada was aware of India's alleged involvement. According to Mr Trudeau, PM Modi's response was to express concern about individuals in Canada critical of the Indian government, requesting that they be arrested.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Canada's Response, India's Retaliation</strong></h2>

<p>The diplomatic fallout between the two countries worsened when India expelled six Canadian diplomats following Mr Trudeau's allegations. India also recalled its High Commissioner to Canada, Sanjay Kumar Verma, as part of the escalating diplomatic row. Mr Trudeau accused India of not cooperating with Canada's investigation, while India dismissed the claims as unfounded.</p>

<p>India responded with rejection of the accusations, stating that the Canadian government had failed to provide any evidence.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"What we have heard today only confirms what we have been saying consistently all along - Canada has presented us (India) no evidence whatsoever in support of the serious allegations that it has chosen to level against India and Indian diplomats," the MEA said in a statement.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This follows India's sharp rebuttal to Canada on Monday, rejecting allegations Mr Verma being a 'person of interest' in a murder investigation, describing them as "preposterous imputations."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Canada reportedly named &nbsp;High Commissioner Verma as a 'person of interest' in its investigation into Nijjar's death. India swiftly hit back, accusing Canada of maligning its officials without evidence and using "preposterous" claims to justify its failure to curb Khalistani extremism on its soil.</p>

<p>In a strongly worded statement, New Delhi condemned Canada's diplomatic communication suggesting that the Indian High Commissioner and other Indian diplomats were implicated in a sensitive investigation. An MEA response stated, "The Government of India strongly rejects these preposterous imputations and ascribes them to the political agenda of the Mr Trudeau Government that is centred around vote bank politics."</p>

<p>The Indian government has consistently argued that Canada provides a safe haven for pro-Khalistani extremists and separatists who pose a threat to India's security. New Delhi also highlighted that it had requested action against these elements, which Canada had failed to take seriously.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Meta is laying off employees across units including Instagram, WhatsApp and Reality Labs, the Verge reported on Wednesday, citing people familiar with the matter.</p>

<p>A Meta spokesperson told Reuters in a statement that a few of its teams were making changes to align with their long-term strategic goals and location strategy.</p>

<p>"This includes moving some teams to different locations and moving some employees to different roles. In situations like these when a role is eliminated, we work hard to find other opportunities for impacted employees," the spokesperson said.</p>

<p>The Verge report did not specify the exact number of job cuts but mentioned that they were small. Meta also did not comment on the numbers.</p>

<p>Separately, the Financial Times reported that Meta fired another two dozen staff in Los Angeles for allegedly using their daily $25 meal credits to instead buy household items including acne pads, wine glasses and laundry detergent.</p>

<p>These terminations are separate from the team restructurings and took place last week, the FT report said.</p>

<p>Meta declined to comment on the FT report.</p>

<p>Meta has slashed around 21,000 jobs since November 2022 to keep costs low with CEO Mark Zuckerberg calling 2023 the "Year of Efficiency".</p>

<p>Meta shares have jumped more than 60% this year.</p>

<p>In its most recent second-quarter results, Meta beat market expectations for revenue and issued a rosy sales forecast for the third quarter, signalling that robust digital-ad spending on its social media platforms can cover the cost of its artificial intelligence investments.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza after Hamas attacked Israeli towns on October 7 last year, resulting in the deaths of 1,206 people, mostly civilians.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Stray dogs have been eating the people killed in Israeli strikes in Gaza, CNN reported Wednesday. Fares Afana, the head of emergency services in the northern part of the war-torn enclave, told CNN that he and his colleagues had received the bodies of Palestinians killed in northern Gaza, with some showing signs of scavenging by animals.</p>

<p>"Stray dogs who are hungry are eating these bodies in the street... It makes it difficult for us to identify the bodies," he said.</p>

<p>He said that the Israeli forces are "destroying everything that represents life or signs of life", referring to the air and ground assaults in northern <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/israel-hezbollah-tunnels-nothing-like-we-saw-in-gaza-israel-shares-video-of-hezbollah-tunnel-6799411" target="_blank">Gaza</a> and the Jabalia area, where Israel claims that Hamas members have been regrouping.</p>

<p>Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza after <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/israel-gaza-iran-hamas-sought-irans-help-for-israel-attack-planned-9-11-style-bombing-report-6779663" target="_blank">Hamas</a> attacked Israeli towns on October 7 last year, resulting in the deaths of 1,206 people, mostly civilians.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/gaza-mother-mourns-son-killed-in-israeli-strike-before-second-polio-vaccine-6803871" target="_blank">Israel's assault</a> has since then killed 42,409 people, the majority civilians, and injured 99,153 others in the Gaza Strip.</p>

<p>In its daily update on Wednesday, the Gaza health ministry said Israeli military strikes had killed 65 Palestinians across the enclave in the past 24 hours.</p>

<p>Mr Afana said that on Monday Israeli troops had fired on hungry residents searching for food at a warehouse aid center run by the UN's agency for Palestine refugees (UNRWA).</p>

<p>"The situation is getting worse," he said, adding that they "can't do their jobs normally".</p>

<p>"What is happening in northern Gaza is a real genocide," he said.</p>

<h3><strong>UNRWA Warns Of 'Real Risk' Of Gaza Famine</strong></h3>

<p>The UNRWA warned Wednesday of the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/in-gaza-hungry-families-forced-to-slaughter-horses-eat-animal-fodder-5141815" target="_blank">risk of famine in Gaza</a> as Israel intensified its operations in the north of the besieged Palestinian territory.</p>

<p>At a press conference, UNRWA chief Philippe Lazzarini said that "there is a real risk today... that we enter a situation where famine or acute malnutrition is unfortunately again a likelihood," pointing to the upcoming winter and the weakened immune systems of Gaza's population.</p>

<p>Speaking on the humanitarian situation in Gaza, he said it had "become a kind of wasteland, which I would say is almost unliveable".</p>

<p>Mr Lazzarini said that with appropriate action, a hunger crisis in Gaza "can be avoided" if convoys and food are allowed to enter.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[North Korea said Thursday that its constitution now defines the South as a "hostile" state, the first time Pyongyang has confirmed legal changes called for by leader Kim Jong Un earlier this year.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>North Korea said Thursday that its constitution now defines the South as a "hostile" state, the first time Pyongyang has confirmed legal changes called for by leader Kim Jong Un earlier this year.</p>

<p>The country <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/why-is-kim-jong-uns-north-korea-blowing-up-roads-railways-to-the-south-6802312">blew up roads</a> and railways linking it to the South this week as "an inevitable and legitimate measure taken in keeping with the requirement of the DPRK Constitution which clearly defines the ROK as a hostile state," the official Korean Central News Agency said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>South Korea's military on Tuesday released video footage of North Korean soldiers dynamiting deeply symbolic roads and railways connecting the two Koreas, days after Pyongyang's military had vowed to "permanently" seal the border with the South.</p>

<p>Relations between the two Koreas are at one of the lowest points in years, after Kim in January defined Seoul as his country's "principal enemy" and said they were no longer interested in reunification.</p>

<p>KCNA said Thursday that the army had taken "a measure to physically cut off the DPRK's roads and railways which lead to the ROK (South Korea)".</p>

<p>The move was "part of the phased complete separation of its territory, where its sovereignty is exercised, from the ROK's territory".</p>

<p>North Korea said that sections of the key inter-Korean roads and railways had "been completely blocked through blasting."</p>

<p>"This is an inevitable and legitimate measure taken in keeping with the requirement of the DPRK Constitution which clearly defines the ROK as a hostile state," it added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The North held a key meeting of its rubber-stamp parliament last week, and this is the first confirmation that the country's basic law was amended in line with Kim's demands.</p>

<p>The report did not provide further details about the constitutional changes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Previously, under a 1991 inter-Korean accord, relations between the North and South were defined as a "special relationship" as part of a process aimed at eventual reunification, not as state-to-state relations.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/north-korea-army-ready-to-shoot-amid-friction-with-south-korea-over-drones-6781818">Kim</a> called for the constitutional change in a speech in January, during which he threatened war if the South were to violate "even 0.001 mm of our territorial land, air and waters."</p>

<h3><strong>Drones&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Seoul has said the North Korean military had been clearing land and laying fresh mines along the border for months, as part of a drive to reinforce the border, which the South claims is largely to prevent defections by Pyongyang's own citizens.</p>

<p>North Korea also recently accused Seoul of using drones to drop anti-regime propaganda leaflets on the capital Pyongyang, with Kim convening a security meeting to direct a plan of "immediate military action" in response, state media reported Tuesday.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Seoul's military initially denied sending drones north but has subsequently declined to comment, even as Pyongyang has warned it would consider it "a declaration of war" if another drone was detected.</p>

<p>Activist groups in the South have long sent propaganda northwards, typically carried by balloons, but enthusiasts are also known to have flown small, hard-to-detect drones into the North.</p>

<p>Unlike conventional drones made of metal, the devices they used were constructed from expanded polypropylene, similar to Styrofoam, allowing them to go undetected by both South and North Korean authorities, according to enthusiasts who spoke to local media.</p>

<p>North Korea has itself sent drones southwards -- in 2022, five of Pyongyang's drones crossed the border, prompting the South Korean military to fire warning shots and deploy fighter jets.</p>

<p>The jets failed to shoot down any of the drones.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Billionaire Elon Musk has donated almost $75 million to the political action committee he created to support Donald Trump's US presidential campaign, according to filings made late Tuesday, illustrating the Tesla founder's growing commitment to the Republican's cause.</p>

<p>Musk, estimated to be the world's richest man, has taken an increasingly visible role in Trump's campaign, accompanying him on stage at a recent rally in Pennsylvania and frequently lambasting his opponent, Democrat Kamala Harris, on social media.</p>

<p>Trump frequently name-checks Musk at rallies and has promised to appoint him to a committee tasked with slashing government bureaucracy.</p>

<p>Harris and Trump are locked in a too-close-to-call race for the White House, according to polls.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-elections-2024-elon-musk-says-he-is-all-in-for-donald-trump-as-the-next-us-president-6740162">Musk</a>'s America PAC raised $74.95 million for Trump's cause between July 1 and September 30, according to filings with the Federal Election Commission.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The PAC has focused on launching grassroots get-out-the-vote efforts, including in battleground states such as Pennsylvania that tip the overall national election result.</p>

<p>On its website, America PAC offers those who sign up to help with voter turnout "$30 per hour, with bonuses for performance."</p>

<p>Musk earlier said he would<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/elon-musk-secretly-funded-right-wing-group-long-before-donald-trump-endorsement-sources-6706711"> pay </a>$47 to anyone who gets a registered swing-state voter to sign a petition supporting free speech and the right to bear arms.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The billionaire endorsed Trump after the Republican survived an assassination attempt in July.</p>

<p>In the same reporting period, Harris's primary Harris Victory Fund PAC hauled in $633 million, according to its FEC filing.</p>

<p>Harris dramatically entered the race for the presidency after the withdrawal of incumbent President Joe Biden, following a disastrous debate performance against Trump in July.</p>

<p>Since then, the current vice president has reinvigorated the party's base and carried out a barnstorming campaign across the country, with a particular focus on battleground states.</p>

<p>Her political action committee's year-to-date receipts were nearing a billion dollars, the filing said, standing at $931.2 million.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>China on Tuesday announced plans to launch a manned lunar mission, construct a lunar space station and explore habitable planets and extra-terrestrial life to expand its space programme in the next few decades.</p>

<p>China's top space bodies unveiled a national mid- and long-term development programme for space science, which will guide the country's planning of space science missions and space research from 2024 to 2050.</p>

<p>An established space power, China in recent years built its own space station which is currently in operation besides launching several space missions, including a lunar probe that collected samples for the first time from the far side of the Moon and brought them back to Earth for scientific studies.</p>

<p>The programme released by the China Academy of Sciences (CAS), China National Space Administration and the China Manned Space Agency to the media here outlined the goals of China's space science, including 17 priority areas under five key scientific themes, and a three-phase roadmap.</p>

<p>The international lunar research station initiated by China will be constructed during the second phase from 2028 to 2035, Ding Chibiao, vice president of the CAS, told the media here.</p>

<p>The programme also outlines a roadmap for the development of space science in China through 2050.</p>

<p>In the first phase, leading up to 2027, China will focus on the space station operation, implementing the manned lunar exploration project, the fourth phase of its lunar exploration programme and the planetary exploration project.</p>

<p>Under the new plan, scientists will also explore the habitability of celestial bodies in the solar system and exoplanets and search for extraterrestrial life, he said.</p>

<p>Key areas of space development in the coming years will be the origin and evolution of the solar system, characterisation of planetary atmospheres, the search for extraterrestrial life, and exoplanet detection, Ding said.</p>

<p>The theme of the extreme universe focuses on exploring the origin and evolution of the universe, revealing the physical laws under extreme cosmic conditions, dark matter and the universe's origin and evolution, as well as the detection of cosmic baryonic matter, according to the programme.</p>

<p>Studies will be conducted on detecting medium to low-frequency gravitational waves and primordial gravitational waves, with the goal of uncovering the nature of gravity and space-time, and the exploration of the Sun and the Earth.</p>

<p>Priority areas include Earth's cycle systems, comprehensive observations of the Earth-Moon, space weather observation, three-dimensional solar exploration, and heliosphere exploration, according to the programme.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Astronauts walking on the moon as part of NASA's first human mission to the lunar South Pole will be wearing Prada, as part of a new venture unveiled on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Private space company Axiom Space teamed up with the Italian luxury brand to provide the surface suits and spacewalk systems for NASA's Artemis 3 mission, which is planned for September 2026.</p>

<p>The external layer of the space suit, designed to reflect heat, is largely white, as it was on the suits worn by the Apollo astronauts who last walked on the moon more than 50 years ago.But the update will have a few touches of grey and some red stripes similar to those seen on Italy's Luna Rossa America's Cup boat, which was also sponsored by Prada.</p>

<p>Matt Ondler, president of Axiom Space, told a press launch in Milan that making the suit had required "extreme engineering" and "fantastic manufacturing capability".</p>

<p>"They will go in places that are incredibly hazardous, extreme environments," he said.</p>

<p>"One of the missions that NASA wants to do is to try to find water craters at the South Pole. These are some of the coldest places in the universe. And so this suit has to be designed very cleverly."</p>

<p>At the lunar South Pole, a land of mountains and deep craters, the sun hovers below or just above the horizon.</p>

<p>As a result, temperatures vary from upwards of 54 degrees Celsius (130 degrees Fahrenheit) in sunlit periods to minus 203 degrees Celsius (minus 334 degrees Fahrenheit) in shadowed areas that have never see the sun, NASA says.</p>

<p>The suit aims to provide maximum comfort to the astronauts, the team said, while also protecting them against radiation, external pressure and provide the power and oxygen they need for up to eight hours of moonwalks.</p>

<p>With the mission set to see the first woman on the moon, the suits are also unisex and can be adapted to different sizes.</p>

<p>"We've blended engineering, science and art to produce the ultimate garments for future moonwalkers, ensuring that astronauts can perform their tasks and missions in safety and comfort," said Russell Ralston, Axiom spacesuit programme manager.</p>

<p>The design of the boots was a particular challenge, in terms of insulation and to make them robust enough for the terrain.</p>

<p>But the materials used are "confidential", said Lorenzo Bertelli, marketing manager for Prada and the son of the fashion house's founder, Miuccia Prada.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Donald Trump, 79, is the oldest major-party presidential candidate ever in the US history.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Democrat's US presidential nominee Kamala Harris attacked her Republican rival Donald Trump on Thursday, calling him "unstable" and questioning the 78-year-old former president's fitness for office. In an interview with right-wing Fox News, Harris, 59, blasted Trump - the oldest major-party presidential candidate ever - for threatening to use the military against internal enemies.</p>

<p>"He has talked about turning the American military on the American people. He has talked about going after the people who are engaged in peaceful protest. He has talked about locking people up because they disagree with him," she said.</p>

<p>"He is unstable, and we should all be concerned," she told the interviewer Bret Baier.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://special.ndtv.com/ndtv-world-summit-2024-167/" target="_blank"><strong>WATCH NDTV World Summit on October 21-22. Get All The Details Here</strong></a></p>

<p>During the half-hour sit-down interview, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="http://www.ndtv.com/world-news/kamala-harris-says-her-presidency-would-not-be-a-continuation-of-joe-biden-6806793" target="_blank">Harris</a> clashed with Baier on several issues and repeatedly asked "may I finish" when he talked over her answers.</p>

<p>She was also pressed on comments she made last week when she said she could not think of anything she would have done differently from US President <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-elections-kamala-harris-will-cut-her-own-path-says-president-joe-biden-6799780" target="_blank">Joe Biden</a> during his four years in the White House.</p>

<p>"My presidency will not be a continuation of Joe Biden's presidency," Harris, who became her party's nominee after 81-year-old Biden dropped out in July.</p>

<p>She said she would bring "fresh and new ideas".</p>

<p>"I represent a new generation of leadership," she added.</p>

<p>Asked when she had first noticed that Biden's mental acuity had "diminished" before he quit the race following a disastrous debate with <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/hope-hes-okay-kamala-harris-as-trump-dances-during-town-hall-6799707" target="_blank">Trump</a>, the Democrat turned the subject back to the Republican.</p>

<p>"Bret, Joe Biden is not on the ballot. And Donald Trump is," she said.</p>

<p>After her interview, the Trump campaign released a statement calling it a "train wreck."</p>

<h3><strong>Harris Asks Trump To Release Medical Report</strong></h3>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/kamala-harris-to-donald-trump-release-your-medical-records-6784346" target="_blank">Kamala Harris</a> this week challenged Donald Trump to release his medical records, days after she was found in "excellent health" and fit for the presidency.</p>

<p>According to a medical report published by the White House on Saturday, Harris "possesses the physical and mental resiliency required to successfully execute the duties of the presidency."</p>

<p>"Yesterday, I released my medical records. Donald Trump should do the same," she wrote on X on Monday.</p>

<p>"I invite the public to watch his rallies and be the decision maker on his acuity," she said in a video attached to the tweet.</p>

<p>As Harris ramped up pressure for details on the physical health and mental acuity of Trump ahead of the US Presidential elections in November, Trump's campaign issued a statement saying he was also "in perfect and excellent health to be Commander in Chief".</p>

<p>A journalist had asked Trump in August whether he would release his medical records and he replied, "Oh sure, I would do that very gladly, sure."</p>

<p>He, however, has not released any detailed medical records since then.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Contracted in 2019 while working in his backyard, Pawulski's condition caused severe migraines and vomiting.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An American man died last week following a five-year fight with a mosquito-borne virus that kills almost 30% of patients. The rare disease is also making a comeback in the tri-state area on the East Coast.</p>

<p>Richard Pawulski, 49, of Colchester, Connecticut, contracted Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) while performing garden work on his woods property in August 2019, according to the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/10/16/us-news/conn-dad-dies-from-mosquito-borne-virus-eee-as-cases-rise/"><em>New York Post.</em></a> Even those who survive the virus's first outbreak, which attacks the brain, are often left with lasting impairments and neurologic issues. When Pawulski first developed the condition, he had severe migraines and was vomiting yellow bile, but doctors were confused.</p>

<p>"I'm not joking when I say your life can change in the blink of an eye, because that was what happened to us," his grieving daughter of Richard, Amellia Pawulski, 18, told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/10/16/us-news/conn-dad-dies-from-mosquito-borne-virus-eee-as-cases-rise/"><em>The Post.</em></a></p>

<p>Richard died at 2:30 am Monday, one week after he was admitted into hospice when doctors determined that "there wasn't much else" that could be done for him, Amellia said.</p>

<p><strong>What is Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE)?</strong></p>

<p>According to the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.cdc.gov/eastern-equine-encephalitis/about/index.html"><em>Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), </em></a>Eastern equine encephalitis is caused by a virus spread to people through the bite of an infected mosquito. It is a rare but serious disease. Approximately 30% of people who develop severe eastern equine encephalitis die, and many survivors have ongoing neurologic problems. Symptoms of eastern equine encephalitis can include fever, headache, vomiting, diarrhoea, seizures, behavioural changes, and drowsiness.</p>

<p>There are no vaccines to prevent or medicines to treat eastern equine encephalitis. People living in areas where eastern equine encephalitis virus circulates should protect themselves by preventing mosquito bites.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>K-pop megastar J-hope from BTS ended eighteen months of South Korean military service Thursday, with his bandmate embracing him and dozens of fans turning up to celebrate his return to the industry.</p>

<p>The seven members of the world's most popular boy band have been on a self-described "hiatus" since 2022 due to their military service, which South Korea requires of all men under 30 due to tensions with the nuclear-armed North.</p>

<p>J-hope, the main dancer of the group, emerged from the gates of his army base in South Korea's central Wonju city, where he was met by fellow band member Jin, who<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/bts-star-jin-finishes-south-korean-military-service-greeted-by-bandmates-5871639"> finished his service</a> in June.</p>

<p>Outside the base fans had hung up colourful banners to welcome the star back to civilian life saying: "The sun is finally shining upon ARMY" referring to the group's official fandom, and: "My bank account! It's ready to go straight to J-hope!"</p>

<p>Fans had put a life-size cut out of <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/entertainment/bts-j-hope-purchased-2-luxury-apartments-for-rs-125-crore-in-seoul-report-6498346">J-hope</a> dancing outside the base, with a giant balloon congratulating him on his military discharge flying overhead.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Fans had been urged not to show up for safety reasons, but early Thursday there were around 50 admirers present -- including international fans from China and Brazil -- outside the base.</p>

<p>A group of Japanese fans rented a bus to get to the military unit, which is located about 100 km (62 miles) from Seoul.</p>

<p>The latest BTS military discharge is likely to be good for the K-pop industry as a whole, analysts said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"J-Hope's comeback is certainly like a refreshing downpour for HYBE during a long, dry spell," Yoo Sung-man, an analyst at Leading Investment and Securities, told AFP.</p>

<p>BTS' agency HBYE is struggling with a legal battle with K-pop girl group NewJeans' superproducer Min Hee-jin, which has been causing a headache for investors, he added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In addition, another BTS member, SUGA, was investigated over a drunk e-scooter incident in Seoul earlier this year, which led to HYBE's share price dropping to a record low.</p>

<p>"Even putting aside the 'Suga' issue, the 'Min Hee-jin and NewJeans' issue needs to be resolved first," said Yoo.</p>

<p>"Unless all BTS members complete their military service and make a full-group comeback, J-Hope's solo return might not be enough to overshadow the conflict completely," he added.</p>

<p>HYBE's share price was up 2.9 per cent in early trading Thursday.</p>

<p>The rest of the band will complete their service in June 2025.</p>

<p>Jin announced Monday that he will release his first solo album in November.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A group of lions mauled a zookeeper to death at one of Europe's largest big-cat parks on Wednesday after a door inside their enclosure was left unlocked, investigators said.</p>

<p>The mauling occurred at the Taigan safari park on the Russian-annexed Crimean peninsula, one of the largest breeding grounds for lions in Europe and home to around 60 of the predators.</p>

<p>"A criminal case has been opened over the death of an employee at the Taigan lion park as a result of a predator attack," the Moscow-installed Investigative Committee of Crimea and Sevastopol said in a statement.</p>

<p>The employee who had worked at the park for almost 17 years died after she "went to clean a cage with three lions, without shutting the bolt of a door between two rooms of the enclosure", investigators said.</p>

<p>The park's owner Oleg Zubkov identified the victim as chief zookeeper Leokadia Perevalova, calling the incident a "tragic" mistake.</p>

<p>"It is unclear how and why this happened, as the animals could not have done such a thing on their own, and apparently there were no people around," he said in a statement on his blog.</p>

<p>"The employees who discovered the body, unfortunately, could no longer provide any assistance, since she had simply been torn to pieces," he said.</p>

<p>On his Telegram channel, Zubkov praised Perevalova as a "valuable employee" who was the "soul of our park", adding that "the human factor of forgetfulness played a role".</p>

<p>"Unfortunately when I arrived there was nothing I could do to help. (They are) top predators and they do not forgive mistakes, he said.</p>

<p>A criminal case has been opened into the death of a person by workplace negligence, investigators said.</p>

<p>The sprawling 70-acre park was opened to visitors in 2012 on the site of a former military base.</p>

<p>Authorities closed the zoo for a month in December 2019 after they accused Zubkov of giving the animals expired feed, an allegation he denied.</p>

<p>He accused Crimea's Russian-installed authorities of tyring to "bankrupt" his business and of deliberately freezing his projects after they seized power in 2014.</p>

<p>Crimea was annexed by Russia in 2014 but is internationally recognised as part of Ukraine.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump on Wednesday stood by debunked claims that immigrants in Ohio were eating pets, telling Latino voters during a town hall he was "just saying what was reported."</p>

<p>Trump in recent weeks has amplified a false claim that has gone viral that Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, were stealing residents' pets or taking wildlife from parks for food.</p>

<p>There have been no credible reports of Haitians eating pets, and officials in Ohio - including Republicans - have repeatedly said the story is untrue.</p>

<p>At a town hall hosted by Univision, an undecided Latino Republican voter from Arizona, a battleground state, asked Trump whether he truly believed that immigrants were eating pets.</p>

<p>"I was just saying what was reported. All I do is report," Trump replied during the event held in Miami. "I was there, I'm going to be there and we're going to take a look."</p>

<p>Trump added that "newspapers" had also reported on the claim, without naming any or providing any details.</p>

<p>Trump, who has not yet traveled to Springfield, has previously said he would conduct mass deportations of Haitian immigrants from the Ohio city, even though the majority of them are in the U.S. legally.</p>

<p>The city has faced bomb threats since Trump began repeating the false accusations about Haitians.</p>

<p>In the final weeks before the Nov. 5 election, Trump is increasingly resorting to darker and more violent language about illegal immigration, an issue that opinion polls show resonates with many voters, especially Republicans.</p>

<p>He is competing against Democrat Kamala Harris for key votes from the growing Latino population. Latino voters have typically backed Democrats, but the Trump campaign is hoping to win over more Latino voters, especially men, on the back of economic discontent.</p>

<p>Harris led Trump by eight percentage points - 47% to 39% - among Hispanic voters in Reuters/Ipsos polling conducted between Sept. 11 and Oct. 7.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United States has a broken immigration system that needs to be repaired, Vice President Kamala Harris said on Wednesday in a rare interview with the Republican-leaning news channel during which she sparred with its popular host.</p>

<p>“The point is that we have a broken immigration system that needs to be repaired,'” Ms Harris told Fox News anchor Bret Baier in a rare sit-down with the news channel.</p>

<p>“So, your Homeland Security Secretary said that 85 per cent of apprehensions,” Mr Baier interjected.</p>

<p>“I'm not finished. We have an immigration system,” Ms Harris tried to continue with her answer.</p>

<p>“It's a rough estimate that 6 million people have been released into the country,” the Fox News anchor interrupted again.</p>

<p>“And let me just finish. I'll get to the question. I promise you. I was beginning to answer,” the vice president pleaded.</p>

<p>“When you came into office, your administration immediately reversed a number of Trump border policies. Most significantly, the policy that required illegal immigrants to be detained through deportation, either in the U.S. or in Mexico. And you switched that policy. They were... released from custody awaiting trial. So instead, included in those were a large number of single men, adult men, who went on to commit heinous crimes. So looking back, do you regret the decision to terminate Remain in Mexico at the beginning of your administration?” Mr Baier asked again.</p>

<p>“At the beginning of our administration, within practically hours of taking the oath, the first bill, practically within hours of taking the oath, was a bill to fix our immigration system,” Ms Harris said as Mr Baier kept on interjecting in between.</p>

<p>“We recognized from day one that to the point of this being your first question, It is a priority for us as a nation and for the American people. Our focus has been on fixing a problem. From day one, then, we have done a number of things, including to address our asylum system and put more resources, getting more judges, what we needed to do to tighten up penalties and increase penalties for illegal crossings, what we needed to do to deal with points of entry between border, entry points,” she said.</p>

<p></p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-media-max-width="560">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Vice President Harris: Within hours of taking the oath, we introduced a bill to fix our broken immigration system. It was not taken up<br />

<p>“We worked on supporting what was a bipartisan effort, including some of the most conservative members of the United States Congress, to actually strengthen the border. That border bill would have put 1,500 more border agents at the border, which is why I believe the Border Patrol agents supported the bill. It would have allowed us to stem the flow of fentanyl coming into the United States, which is a scourge affecting people of every background, every geographic location in our country, killing people,” she said.</p>

<p>“Donald Trump learned about that bill and told them to kill it because he preferred to instead of fixing a problem,” Harris alleged.</p>

<p>“This election in 20 days will determine whether we have a president of the United States who actually cares more about fixing a problem, even if it is not to their political advantage in an election, because there was a solution,” she said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After dodging the issue for weeks, Republican vice-presidential candidate JD Vance said unequivocally on Wednesday he believes false claims that Donald Trump did not lose the 2020 election.</p>

<p>Taking questions from reporters at a campaign event in Williamsport, Pennsylvania, Vance was again asked if Trump lost to President Joe Biden four years ago.</p>

<p>"On the election of 2020, I've answered this question directly a million times. No! I think there are serious problems in 2020," Vance said. "So, did Donald Trump lose the election in 2020? Not by the words that I would use."</p>

<p>Trump, the Republican candidate for president in 2024, continues to falsely claim that he lost the 2020 election due to extensive voter fraud, a view shared by millions of his supporters. Numerous inquiries, however, have found no evidence of fraud.</p>

<p>During his current run for president, Trump has suggested he will challenge the results if he does not prevail in the Nov. 5 contest against Democrat Kamala Harris, the US vice president.</p>

<p>His efforts to overturn the 2020 election led to his indictment by federal and state officials. He still awaits trial in those cases. His refusal to accept the outcome also sparked the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol by thousands of his supporters.</p>

<p>Vance, a first-term U.S. senator, made headlines when he sidestepped the question during his debate with Harris' running mate, Tim Walz, on Oct. 1, saying he was focused on "the future."</p>

<p>That led Walz to rebuke him. "That's a damning non-answer," he said.</p>

<p>In Williamsport, Vance said he was not espousing "some crazy conspiracy theory" in arguing Trump won. Instead, he blamed the election outcome on online censorship by large tech companies.</p>

<p>Pennsylvania is considered perhaps the most critical of the seven battleground states that will determine the election.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former One Direction singer Liam Payne was found dead outside a hotel in Buenos Aires after falling from his third-floor room balcony, Argentine police confirmed on Wednesday.</p>

<p>In a statement, the capital police said they were called to the hotel in the capital's leafy Palermo neighborhood where they were notified of an "aggressive man who could be under the effects of drugs and alcohol."</p>

<p>The hotel manager said he heard a loud noise at the back of the hotel, and when police arrived they found that a man had fallen over the balcony in his room, the statement said.</p>

<p>Emergency workers confirmed the death of the 31-year-old British singer, who was reportedly found in the hotel's interior patio.</p>

<p>"We're deeply saddened to learn of Liam Payne's tragic passing today. During this difficult time, our hearts remain with his family, loved ones, and fans," MTV said on X.</p>

<p>Neither Payne's record label Republic Records, nor its owner Universal Music Group, could immediately be reached for comment.</p>

<p>Payne rose to global fame as part of the since-disbanded pop band One Direction, alongside Harry Styles, Zayn Malik, Niall Horan and Louis Tomlinson.</p>

<p>The boy band got its start after finishing third on the British version of the X Factor music competition show in 2010, but the group broke up in 2016 as its members pursued different projects including solo careers.</p>

<p>One Direction was ranked the third greatest boy band of all time by Entertainment Weekly in 2024. According to Celebrity Net Worth, Payne's One Direction and solo career helped garner a net worth of some $70 million.</p>

<p>Reuters reporters at the scene saw crowds gathering outside the hotel, where dozens of police and emergency services teams had cordoned off an area as night fell on the city.</p>

<p>Local news outlet Todo Noticias TV interviewed Hernan Palazzo, who works near the hotel in the Palermo neighborhood, who said, "The neighborhood is very shaken up ... There's a lot of police, some fans arriving. It is very sad."</p>

<p>Payne had a son named Bear with British TV personality and Girls Aloud singer Cheryl in 2017.</p>

<p>Payne had earlier this month attended the concert of his former bandmate Niall Horan in Buenos Aires. The musician has been open in the media about struggling with addiction and spending time in a rehabilitation facility.</p>

<p>Earlier on Wednesday, Payne had appeared to post on Snapchat about his trip in Argentina, talking about riding horses, playing polo, and looking forward to returning home to see his dog.</p>

<p>"It's a lovely day here in Argentina," he said in the video.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A combative Kamala Harris pledged a clean break from Joe Biden's presidency Wednesday in a feisty interview with right-wing Fox News as she sought to reach Republican voters wary of Donald Trump.</p>

<p>Harris clashed with interviewer Bret Baier on hot-button issues including immigration, with the Democratic nominee repeatedly asking to be allowed to complete her answers.</p>

<p>"May I finish responding?" Vice President Harris at one point said to Baier, regarded as a tough but fair interviewer, in an encounter broadcast from the battleground state of Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>Pressed on previous comments when she said she could not think of anything she would have done differently from Biden, Harris replied: "My presidency will not be a continuation of Joe Biden's presidency."</p>

<p>"I will bring my life experiences, my professional experiences, and fresh and new ideas. I represent a new generation of leadership," added Harris, 59, who became her party's nominee after the aging Biden dropped out in July.</p>

<p>Biden had said on Tuesday that Harris would "cut her own path" as president.</p>

<p>Harris also launched into a blistering attack on Republican former president Trump, 78, for threatening to use the military against internal enemies.</p>

<p>"He's the one who tends to demean and belittle and diminish the American people. He's the one who talks about an enemy within."</p>

<p><strong>- Harris's gamble -</strong></p>

<p>The Democrat faced probing questioning during the interview, during which Fox News played an advert for Trump about operations for transgender prisoners, and a clip of Trump defending his military remarks.</p>

<p>Her first-ever sitdown with Fox was a gamble as she seeks to break the deadlock in a White House race that remains neck-and-neck with less than three weeks to go.</p>

<p>Fox News has played a key role in Trump's political rise, and he earlier blasted the network over the Harris interview, accusing Baier of being "very soft."</p>

<p>Trump's campaign later described it as a "train wreck."</p>

<p>"Kamala was angry, defensive, and once again abdicated any responsibility for the problems Americans are facing," Trump spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said in a statement.</p>

<p>Trump also sat down with Fox News ahead of Harris's appearance, in a pre-recorded town hall with an all-female audience, where the conversation turned to vitro fertilization (IVF), a fertility treatment that Democrats say is threatened by his policies.</p>

<p>Despite being on home turf, it was a challenging topic as women have been turned off by Trump's statements on reproductive rights, and by his campaign more broadly.</p>

<p>He was cheered as he told his audience in the swing state of Georgia that Republicans were the party championing the procedure.</p>

<p>"I want to talk about IVF. I'm the father of IVF, so I want to hear this question," he said.</p>

<p><strong>- 'Bizarre' -</strong></p>

<p>Harris, who has made the defense of reproductive rights a centerpiece of her election platform, called his comments "bizarre."</p>

<p>Reproductive rights have been a major vulnerability for Trump since the Supreme Court, featuring three Trump-picked justices, gutted federal protections for abortion access in 2022.</p>

<p>Many in the anti-abortion movement also want to see IVF curbed.</p>

<p>Trump's town hall in Georgia was filmed on Tuesday, the first day of early voting in the closely-watched state, with voters casting a record number of 328,000 ballots.</p>

<p>Trump has been charged with election tampering in the state, pushing for Georgia officials to "find" enough votes to overturn Biden's narrow win there in 2020.</p>

<p>Harris at least knows she has one vote in the bag for 2024. Former president Jimmy Carter cast his vote by mail on Wednesday, just days after turning 100.</p>

<p>The Democrat was fulfilling what his family said was a wish to live long enough to back Harris in the election.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Inaction on the water crisis could put more than half of the world's food production at risk by 2050, experts warned in a major report published Thursday.</p>

<p>"Nearly 3 billion people and more than half of the world's food production are now in areas where total water storage is projected to decline," said the report by the Global Commission on the Economics of Water (GCEW).</p>

<p>The report also warned the water crisis could lead to an eight percent drop in GDP on average for high-income countries by 2050 and as much as 15 percent for lower-income countries.</p>

<p>Disruptions of the water cycle "have major global economic impacts," said the report.</p>

<p>The economic declines would be a consequence of "the combined effects of changing precipitation patterns and rising temperatures due to climate change, together with declining total water storage and lack of access to clean water and sanitation".</p>

<p>Facing this crisis, the report called for the water cycle to be viewed as a "global common good" and for a transformation of water governance at all levels.</p>

<p>"The costs entailed in these actions are very small in comparison to the harm that continued inaction will inflict on economies and humanity," it said.</p>

<p>While water is often perceived as "an abundant gift of nature", the report stressed it was scarce and costly to transport.</p>

<p>It called for the elimination of "harmful subsidies in water-intensive sectors or redirecting them towards water-saving solutions and providing targeted support for the poor and vulnerable".</p>

<p>"We have to couple the pricing of water with appropriate subsidies," said the World Trade Organization's Director-General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, a co-chair of the GCEW, during an online briefing.</p>

<p>Another co-chair, Singaporean President Tharman Shanmugaratnam, insisted on the need to see water as a global problem, to "innovate and invest" to solve the crisis and "stabilise the global hydrological cycle".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar took a leisurely morning stroll within the Indian High Commission campus in Islamabad, Pakistan, on Tuesday. He was on an official visit to Pakistan to attend the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation conclave.</p>

<p>In a post on X (formerly Twitter), Mr. Jaishankar stated, "A morning walk together with colleagues of Team @IndiainPakistan in our High Commission campus."</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told a French newspaper that Israeli forces had found "state-of-the-art" Russian weapons in searches of Hezbollah bases in south Lebanon.</p>

<p>Netanyahu highlighted to Le Figaro newspaper, in an interview released Wednesday, that under a 2006 UN Security Council resolution only the Lebanese army was allowed to have weapons south of the country's key Litani river. &nbsp;</p>

<p>"However, in this area, Hezbollah has dug hundreds of tunnels and caches, where we have just found a quantity of state-of-the-art Russian weapons," the French article quoted Netanyahu as saying.</p>

<p>The Washington Post, quoting Israeli officials, has reported that Russian and Chinese anti-tank weapons had been found in Israel's raids inside Lebanon since it escalated its conflict with the Iran-backed Hezbollah last month.</p>

<p>The Israeli army did not immediately respond to an AFP question about the prime minister's comments.</p>

<p>Israel says the aim of its military campaign against Hezbollah is to make the region safe so that about 60,000 evacuated residents of northern Israel can return to their homes.</p>

<p>Many left their homes because of cross-border shelling between Israel and Hezbollah after the launch of the Gaza war on October 7 last year.</p>

<p>"A new civil war in Lebanon would be a tragedy. It is certainly not our aim to provoke one. Israel does not intend to interfere in Lebanon's internal affairs," Netanyahu told Le Figaro.</p>

<p>"Our only aim is to allow our citizens living along the Lebanon frontier to go home and feel safe," he added.</p>

<p>Hezbollah and Israel fought a gradually mounting artillery duel after the Hamas attacks on Israel set off the Gaza war.</p>

<p>Since Israel started raids on Hezbollah, at least 1,373 people have died in Lebanon, according to an AFP tally of Lebanese health ministry figures. The real toll is likely higher.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

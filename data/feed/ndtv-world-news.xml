<p>"We did it, Joe," exclaimed the 49th Vice-President of the United States four years ago-the phrase becoming a war cry of sorts, coming from a half-Black, half-Indian woman, married to a Jewish-American man. This moment became a landmark in the sociopolitical history of the US. For all its celebratory moments, American democracy has a long way to go in terms of representation and inclusivity. When it comes to women, the gender schemas work as effectively in the oldest democracy of the world as it does in the emergent ones to keep women away from the high table.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Can Kamala Harris be successful in the Holy Grail pursuit of occupying the Oval Office? The odds are stacked against her, starting from the delayed announcement of her candidature. With less than a month to go for the Democratic convention to secure her name on the ticket, Harris has a mountain to climb. The funding numbers are encouraging but the money can go only thus far in attitudinal and ideological battles.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Women And Politics</strong></h2>

<p>To begin with, there is a problem with the recall. Studies (J Hitchon &amp; C Chang, 1995) have revealed that voters recall women candidates in terms of their family and appearance and their men counterparts in terms of campaign activities. Harris understands that and has made this tendency work for her by highlighting her family background. However, in a deeply polarised American society which is in the throes of backlash against diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI), this strategy may not work as desired any longer.&nbsp;</p>

<p>American women have been consistently voting at a higher rate than men for more than four decades now. They are certainly not less political than men. Yet, even they are not sending enough women to political offices. Women candidates continue to get penalised for expressing emotions, particularly anger. Harris has been trying to keep her 'anger' in check, often descending into banalities in her public speeches. She has become a constant fodder for the meme factory. Whether this is a carefully crafted strategy, only time will tell. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>"Too Coloured", "Not Coloured Enough"</strong></h2>

<p>Harris was only the second Black woman elected to the US Senate in the history of the country. This tells the world something that the Americans cannot be proud of. "The most disrespected person in America is the Black woman. The most unprotected person in America is the Black woman. The most neglected person in America is the Black woman," said Malcolm X in 1962. Per some critical indices like education, healthcare, wages et al, the observation holds even today. Harris has come a long way jumping over fiery hoops of racial and gender discrimination. Her win in the presidential polls will be a bigger moment than Barack Obama's presidency in terms of America's race issue. A decade after the 'Black Lives Matter' movement first made its appearance on social media, American society continues to struggle to find the golden equilibrium. The anti-DEI rabble-rousers have now found effective means to punish individuals and institutions that do not toe supremacist lines.</p>

<p>But Harris is not just Black, she's also half-Indian and the country celebrated her from New Delhi to Chennai as its prodigal daughter. With a steadily growing population in the US over the years, Indians have emerged as a group with political aspirations. Indian community's cultural, regional and religious associations have played an important role in increasing the political heft of Indian Americans. The flip side of this is the growing resentment among the fraudulently so-called originals-the Whites-against powerful immigrant communities. Ironically, even Black Americans harbour some resentment against immigrant communities that have reached the upper rungs of the socio-economic ladder. While this is sociologically 'natural', people like Harris are peculiarly affected. She's coloured but not adequately so for some.</p>

<h2><strong>A Course-Correction Too Late</strong></h2>

<p>2024 is no 2018, when a surge for Democrats in general and women candidates in particular, sent Democratic women politicians of different ethnicities like Debra Haaland and Sharice Davids (Native American); Ayanna Pressley and Jahana Hayes (Women of Colour); Veronica Escobar, Sylvia R. Garcia, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (Latinas) to the Congress. The Republican campaign is bolstered by many a foreign policy faux pas of the Biden administration, the most important one being its role in the Israel-Palestine conflict. Even the captive Democratic voter is expressing dissent. The assassination attempt on Donald Trump has catapulted his already strong chances.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Choosing Harris over Biden is a tactical course-correction for Democrats, but it may have come a bit too late in the day. Her strengths may not get optimised, her weaknesses are for all to see. As her V-P tenure goes, she has all the blame to carry but no benefits to reap.</p>

<p>Harris has the unenviable position of being the woman who cleans up after a man. If she emerges triumphant, it will be her personal victory, not that of the party.&nbsp;</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Australia on Thursday followed Europe and the United States by levying sanctions on Israeli settlers accused of "beatings, sexual assault and torture" of Palestinians in the occupied West Bank.</p>

<p>Foreign Minister Penny Wong announced financial sanctions and travel bans on seven individuals and the Hilltop Youth religious settler group.</p>

<p>"The individuals sanctioned today have been involved in violent attacks on Palestinians," Wong said.</p>

<p>"This includes beatings, sexual assault and torture of Palestinians resulting in serious injury and in some cases, death."</p>

<p>Settlement expansion has increased sharply since Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu returned to power in late 2022 at the helm of a hardline pro-settler coalition.</p>

<p>The West Bank -- occupied by Israel since 1967 -- has seen a significant spike in violence since the start of the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.</p>

<p>At least 589 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank by Israeli troops or settlers since the outbreak of the war on October 7, according to Palestinian authorities.</p>

<p>Over the same period at least 17 Israelis, including soldiers, have been killed in attacks in the territory involving Palestinians, according to Israeli official figures.</p>

<p>Canberra's announcement echoes moves by the US, Britain, Canada and the European Union who have also blacklisted Israeli settlers.</p>

<p>"Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territories are illegal under international law and a significant obstacle to peace," Wong added.</p>

<p>The International Court of Justice found Israel's occupation of the Palestinian territories illegal on Friday.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli forces retrieved the bodies of five people taken hostage in the Gaza Strip during Hamas's October 7 attack on southern Israel, the military said Thursday.</p>

<p>The army said the bodies of hostage Maya Goren as well as soldiers Ravid Aryeh Katz, Oren Goldin, Tomer Ahimas and Kiril Brodski had been returned to Israel.</p>

<p>The bodies were recovered on Wednesday during an operation in Khan Yunis, the main city in the south of the Gaza Strip, the military said.</p>

<p>The four soldiers were killed during the October 7 attack launched by Hamas militants, it added.</p>

<p>In December, the military had announced the death of Goren, who was abducted and taken to Gaza on October 7.</p>

<p>Thursday's announcement comes after two Israeli kibbutzim, Nir Oz and Nir Yitzhak, said in separate statements that the army had recovered the bodies of Goren and Goldin.</p>

<p>"Last night, we were informed that in a military rescue operation, the body of the late Maya Goren was recovered," kibbutz Nir Oz said, adding that her family had been informed and more information would follow.</p>

<p>Later in a separate statement kibbutz Nir Yitzhak said the army had returned the body of Goldin.</p>

<p>"This evening, we were informed about the rescue operation for the late Oren Goldin, a member of the kibbutz emergency team, who fell on October 7" during the attack by Hamas militants, Nir Yitzhak said.</p>

<p>On October 7 Hamas militants attacked southern Israeli communities, which resulted in the deaths of 1,197 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.</p>

<p>Militants also seized 251 hostages, 111 of whom remain in Gaza, including 39 the military says are dead.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory military campaign in Gaza has killed at least 39,145 people, also mostly civilians, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The affordable internet service Starlink is now operational on more than 1,000 aircraft, SpaceX and Tesla CEO Elon Musk said on Thursday.</p>

<p>According to the company, Starlink keeps passengers connected with high-speed internet from the moment they step onboard their plane.</p>

<p>"Using Starlink on a plane feels like you're on a high-speed ground fibre connection," said the tech billionaire in a post on social media platform X.</p>

<p>Musk recently informed that Sierra Leone in Africa became the 100th country - and the 10th African nation - to be connected to Starlink.</p>

<p>In May, the company launched Starlink in Indonesia and Fiji. According to Musk, no long-term contract is required to order the high-speed internet service with Starlink.</p>

<p>The satellite-based internet service has also received preliminary approval from Sri Lanka to provide internet service in the island nation.</p>

<p>However, the internet service has yet to receive approval from the Indian government.</p>

<p>The commercial part has been examined on issues such as foreign investment and net worth, and the technical requirements have been examined in accordance with the licensing conditions in the country.</p>

<p>Once Starlink gets approval, it will be issued a Global Mobile Personal Communication by Satellite (GMPCS) services license, which is required to provide satellite communication services in the country.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Philippine-flagged tanker carrying 1.4 million litres of industrial fuel oil capsized and sank off Manila on Thursday, authorities said, as they raced against time to contain the spill.</p>

<p>The MT Terra Nova had been heading for the central city of Iloilo when it sank in Manila Bay, nearly seven kilometres (4.3 miles) off Limay municipality in Bataan province, near the capital, in the early hours.</p>

<p>An oil spill stretching several kilometres has been detected in the busy waterway.</p>

<p>"We are racing against time and we will try to do our best to contain it immediately and stop the fuel from leaking," Philippine Coast Guard spokesperson Rear Admiral Armando Balilo said at a briefing.</p>

<p>He warned that if all the oil in the tanker were to leak, it would be the biggest spill in Philippine history.</p>

<p>"There is a big danger that Manila will be affected, even the shoreline of Manila if the fuel will leak because it is within Manila Bay," Balilo said.</p>

<p>Transport Secretary Jaime Bautista said 16 of the 17 crew members had been rescued.</p>

<p>A search was underway for the missing crew member, but Bautista said strong winds and high waves were hampering response efforts.</p>

<p>Four of the crew were receiving medical treatment.</p>

<p>The Coast Guard said it was investigating "if there was an existing weather disturbance in the vicinity waters" when the MT Terra Nova capsized and sank.</p>

<p>The vessel sank as heavy rains fuelled by Typhoon Gaemi and the seasonal monsoon lashed Manila and surrounding regions in recent days.</p>

<p>An oil slick stretching about 3.7 kilometres was being carried by a "strong current" in an easterly, north-easterly direction, the Coast Guard said in a report.</p>

<p>Coast Guard Commandant Admiral Ronnie Gavan said he has ordered an investigation into the incident.</p>

<p>Marine environmental protection personnel have been mobilised to help contain the slick.</p>

<p>One of the worst oil spills in the Philippines was in February 2023, when a fuel tanker carrying 800,000 litres of industrial fuel oil sank in waters off the central island of Mindoro.</p>

<p>Diesel fuel and thick oil from that vessel contaminated the waters and beaches along the coast of Oriental Mindoro province, devastating the fishing and tourism industries.</p>

<p>The oil dispersed over hundreds of kilometres of waters famed for having some of the most diverse marine life in the world.</p>

<p>Thousands of fishermen were ordered to stay on shore until they could fish safely, and swimming was also banned.</p>

<p>In 2006, a tanker sank off the central island of Guimaras spilling tens of thousands of gallons of oil that destroyed a marine reserve, ruined local fishing grounds and covered stretches of coastline in black sludge.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Many Democratic leaders have backed Kamala Harris as the party's new US Presidential candidate, but ex-president Barack Obama has held off so far.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many Democratic leaders have backed <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/joe-biden-praises-kamala-harris-shes-experienced-shes-tough-shes-capable-6182671" target="_blank">Kamala Harris</a> as the party's new US Presidential candidate, but ex-president Barack Obama has held off so far.</p>

<p>According to the New York Post, Obama hasn't endorsed Harris - who US President <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/joe-biden-says-us-is-more-powerful-than-any-dictator-or-tyrant-6182537#pfrom=home-ndtv_topscroll" target="_blank">Joe Biden</a> supported after he dropped out of the race on Sunday, as he doesn't think she can beat Republican candidate <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/at-campaign-rally-donald-trump-calls-kamala-harris-a-radical-left-lunatic-6182225" target="_blank">Donald Trump</a>.</p>

<p>"Obama is very upset because he knows she can't win," a Biden family source told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/07/24/us-news/obama-doesnt-believe-kamala-harris-can-beat-trump-sources/" target="_blank">The New York Post</a>.</p>

<p>"Obama knows she's just incompetent - the border czar who never visited the border, saying that all migrants should have health insurance. She cannot navigate the landmines that are ahead of her," the source said. "When you are running for president there are things you can and can't say."</p>

<p>The source said that Obama's hope was to get Biden out of the way and an article written by actor <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/joe-biden-supporter-george-clooney-requests-him-to-leave-presidential-race-6077438" target="_blank">George Clooney</a>, asking him to step aside, was a part of that plan.</p>

<p>Obama wanted Arizona Senator Mark Kelly "at the top of the ticket" when the Democratic National Convention is held next month, the source told The New York Post.</p>

<p>"Obama is furious, things haven't gone his way, which is why he is not joining in the Democratic Party's support of Harris," the source added.</p>

<p>However, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/obama-plans-endorse-harris-president-soon-rcna163279" target="_blank">NBC News</a> reported on Thursday that Barack Obama plans to endorse Kamala Harris soon.</p>

<p>Obama privately has fully supported Harris' candidacy and has been in regular contact with her, the report said, citing people familiar with the discussions.</p>

<p>"Aides to Obama and Harris also have discussed arranging for the two of them to appear together on the campaign trail, though no date has been set," the report said.</p>

<h3><strong>Michelle Obama To Replace Joe Biden?</strong></h3>

<p>Earlier last month, before Joe Biden bowed out, US Senator Ted Cruz predicted that former First Lady <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/michelle-obama-to-replace-joe-biden-us-senators-bold-prediction-5994892" target="_blank">Michelle Obama</a> would replace him.</p>

<p>His prediction came after Biden's presidential debate against Donald Trump, which was widely criticised by political analysts.</p>

<p>"The odds are north of 80% that the Democratic Party will remove Joe Biden from the ticket and replace him with Michelle Obama because Biden did so disastrously badly (in the debate) that Democrats across the country are in utter freefall and complete panic," he said.</p>

<p>Michelle Obama has so far not expressed any interest in joining the race to the White House.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former US President Barack Obama commended President Joe Biden's dedication to the nation in light of Biden's recent Oval Office address, marking a pivotal moment in American politics.</p>

<p>Biden's first speech came since he announced his withdrawal from the 2024 election race and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democratic Party nominee for president.</p>

<p>"Joe Biden has stayed true to these words again and again over a lifetime of service to the American people," Obama remarked, reflecting on Biden's extensive career in public office.</p>

<p>The Oval Office address, traditionally reserved for moments of national significance or policy declarations, provided Biden with a platform to articulate his decision and rally support for Harris as the next leader of the country.</p>

<p>Returning to the White House after testing negative for COVID-19, Biden framed the upcoming election as a critical choice between progress and regression, hope and division. "I revere this office, but I love my country more," Biden affirmed, emphasising his commitment to defending democracy and the collective well-being of the American people.</p>

<p>In his address, Biden called upon Americans to unite and recognise their shared values, casting the election as pivotal in shaping the nation's trajectory for decades to come. He expressed optimism in the American spirit and underscored the importance of protecting democratic principles, urging unity over division.</p>

<p>While Biden did not directly mention former President Donald Trump, he contrasted his approach with Trump's contentious presidency, highlighting the imperative of safeguarding the integrity of democratic processes.</p>

<p>The upcoming US presidential election on November 5 will see Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democratic nominee, following Biden's endorsement. Harris, has garnered substantial support within the party and secured enough delegates for nomination, however, former US President Obama has not formally endorsed Harris.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Paris Olympic Games will be one of the most high-risk in history owing to a combination of internal strife within France and heightened global geopolitical tensions.</p>

<p>France is grappling with deep internal divisions: the country's volatile political climate and the potential for demonstrations or violence pose significant challenges for organisers.</p>

<p>The current global geopolitical landscape, marked by heightened tensions between major powers, further amplifies the security threats. These Olympics could serve as a potential target for state-sponsored actors seeking to exploit the event for their own agendas.</p>

<p>In response to these elevated threats, organisers are implementing unprecedented security measures, including deploying a record number of security personnel.</p>

<p>About 30,000 police, increasing to a record 45,000 at peak times, will work on the four-week Olympics and Paralympics across the Ile-de-France region covering Paris. They will be supplemented with police forces from across Europe to bolster security efforts.</p>

<p><strong>Islamist Terror</strong></p>

<p>A significant concern is the threat posed by Islamist terrorist networks.</p>

<p>Previous attacks on sporting and cultural events, combined with reports of foiled attempts by French authorities, underline this risk.</p>

<p>The escalation of the Israeli-Hamas conflict following the October 7, 2023, terror attack exacerbates this danger. Islamist terrorists may exploit the situation to position themselves as defenders of Palestinians and Muslims, targeting not just Israel but also Western countries that support Israel.</p>

<p>Daesh (ISIS) emerges as a primary suspect, especially since it operates as an umbrella network offering justification, inspiration and identity to lone actors and small cells operating in its name.</p>

<p>The possibility of Hamas conducting operations on European soil, as evidenced by arrests in Denmark and Germany, complicates the landscape.</p>

<p>Historically, Hamas has distanced itself from international Islamist terrorist networks such as Daesh and Al Qaeda, focusing on Israel. However, the dynamics have shifted post-October 7, with the conflict being framed as a broader Arab and Muslim cause against a morally corrupt West supporting Israel.</p>

<p>This alignment could potentially lead to cooperation between Hamas and Daesh.The Munich 1972 Olympics serve as a tragic reminder of the vulnerability of such events. The infiltration of the Olympic Village, the killing of Israeli athletes, and the taking of hostages by Black September highlight the dangers.</p>

<p>The anti-Semitic atmosphere in Europe, coupled with past rhetoric justifying attacks on Israelis, suggests Israeli athletes and fans could be at heightened risk during the Paris Games.</p>

<p><strong>Deadly Threats</strong></p>

<p>Hostage-taking, suicide bombings, and planted explosives are among the potential threats.</p>

<p>Although suicide bombings have become less common in Europe, they remain a possibility. The complexity of monitoring and gathering intelligence requires international cooperation to thwart such attacks.</p>

<p>The recent attacks by ISIS-affiliated militants in Moscow demonstrate the deadly potential of shooting sprees in crowded areas, while France's experience with knife and vehicle attacks adds another layer of concern.</p>

<p>The worst-case scenario involves multiple, simultaneous attacks across various locations, employing diverse methods and targets, extending beyond athletic venues to include churches and synagogues.</p>

<p><strong>What Motivates A Terrorist?</strong></p>

<p>The threat landscape is further complicated by the diverse pathways to radicalisation and the varied motivations that drive individuals to violence.</p>

<p>Extremists draw inspiration from a range of ideologies, and their motivations may be personal, social, or political. That's also because the Olympics provide an attractive high-profile platform for extremist groups and individuals seeking to carry out attacks.</p>

<p>Alt-right extremism is another significant threat. On July 17, French anti-terror police detained an alleged neo-Nazi sympathiser suspected of wanting to target the Olympic torch relay.</p>

<p><strong>Beyond Paris</strong></p>

<p>Social media plays a crucial role in amplifying extremist narratives and providing a platform for radicalisation.</p>

<p>The interconnectedness of the digital world means that even attacks far from Paris, such as at a public viewing event, could have a significant impact on the Games.</p>

<p>But security considerations extend beyond the immediate vicinity of Olympic venues, encompassing all media-related and public events associated with the games. The global reach of the Olympics means that any security breach, regardless of location, could have far-reaching consequences.</p>

<p>The spirit of the Olympics lies in peaceful competition, reminiscent of their ancient Greek origins. The 2024 Paris Olympics present a unique set of security challenges, requiring a comprehensive and multifaceted approach that addresses both internal and external threats.</p>

<p>International cooperation, intelligence gathering, and a thorough understanding of the evolving threat landscape are crucial for safeguarding athletes, spectators, and the public.</p>

<p>Marco Lombardi, director of ITSTIME research centre, is full professor at the Catholic University of Sacred Heart, where he teaches crisis management and risk communication, mass communication theory, sociology, intelligence and counter terrorism and security policies. He is member of the Governmental Commission on Counter Radicalisation and of the Strategic Policy Committee of the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation.</p>

<p>Maria Alvanou is a Criminologist (International Research Doctorate in Criminology-University of Trento) with the Italian Team for Security, Terroristic Issues &amp; Managing Emergencies (ITSTIME) at the Catholic University of Sacred Heart. Her doctoral research on Palestinian female suicide bombers during the second Intifada included fieldwork in Israel. She has been a member of the RAN and has taught at several law enforcement and military schools.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>American and Canadian warplanes intercepted two Russian and two Chinese bombers in international airspace near the state of Alaska on Wednesday, the joint US-Canadian North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) said.</p>

<p>"NORAD detected, tracked, and intercepted two Russian TU-95 and two PRC H-6 military aircraft operating in the Alaska Air Defense Identification Zone," it said.</p>

<p>The zone is a perimeter in which air traffic is monitored beyond the border of national airspace to provide additional reaction time in case of hostile actions.</p>

<p>Intercepts of Russian aircraft -- in which they are contacted visually or electronically by US or Canadian planes -- are relatively common in the area.</p>

<p>"Fighter jets from the United States and Canada conducted the intercept," NORAD said, adding that the bombers "remained in international airspace and did not enter American or Canadian sovereign airspace," and that their activity "is not seen as a threat."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A bike ride took a deadly turn for a 38-year-old Russian social media influencer in Turkey after she crashed into a truck while riding her red BMW motorcycle. According to Turkish media outlet <em>Turkiye Today</em>, Tatyana Ozolina, who goes by "MotoTanya" on social media, was travelling between Mugla and Bodrum when the fatal crash occurred. She lost control of her red BMW S1000RR 2015 and collided with a truck near Milas. Despite the immediate arrival of emergency services, Ms Ozolina was pronounced dead at the scene.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A Turkish biker accompanying her, Onur Obut, survived but suffered serious injuries and is in hospital. A third biker present at the scene was uninjured, the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.turkiyetoday.com/lifestyle/russias-most-beautiful-biker-tatyana-dies-in-motorcycle-crash-in-turkiye-32287/">outlet </a>reported. The authorities are still investigating the circumstances surrounding the fatal accident that occurred.</p>

<p>Ms Ozolina, widely recognized as MotoTanya, was a popular Moto vlogger with over 1 million followers on Instagram and 2 million on YouTube. The influencer dubbed "Russia's most beautiful biker" is known for her global motorcycle adventures. In her last Instagram post, Ms Ozolina shared that she wasn't allowed to enter Europe.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"4000 km from home. Greece missed me but didn't miss my motorcycle. I was in Greece on foot. I bought a magnet and returned it to Turkey. I was upset that I didn't manage to ride around Europe, but not much because I knew that the situation could be like this... therefore, I moved on. Conquer beautiful, hot and hospitable Turkey," she wrote.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/29407600/influencer-russias-most-beautiful-biker-killed-horror-crash/amp/"><em>The Sun</em></a>, Ms Ozolina's bike was struck by another rider group, causing her to brake abruptly. She was unable to avoid a collision and ploughed into a truck, losing control and suffering fatal injuries. She died before the ambulance arrived. Her family including her son, 13, is "in a state of shock," the outlet reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a tribute, Andrei Ivanov, head of the MotoMoscow Association, said, "MotoTanya is not with us anymore...she had a bright and beautiful life.... Millions of people followed her. Perhaps there is not a single motorcyclist in the country who was indifferent to Tatyana. She was adored, envied, admired, copied, awarded as a top blogger and, at the same time, discussed and slandered. Now all that remains is her memory. Sleep well."&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's address to a joint session of the US Congress on Wednesday sparked controversy and division among lawmakers and US citizens. Representative Rashida Tlaib, the sole Palestinian-American member of Congress, held up a sign labeling Netanyahu a "war criminal" and "guilty of genocide" during his speech today.</p>

<p>Tlaib, a vocal critic of Israel's actions in Gaza, was joined by Hani Almadhoun, a Palestinian who has lost numerous family members in the conflict.</p>

<p>Tlaib was accompanied by an invited guest, Hani Almadhoun, a Palestinian who has lost more than 150 members of his extended family since Israel launched its war with the aim of destroying Hamas.</p>

<p>"After witnessing his sister forced to eat animal feed, he and his family were determined to start a soup kitchen to feed their starving neighbors,” Tlaib wrote in a post on X (formerly Twitter).</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">I will never back down in speaking truth to power.<br />
<br />
The apartheid government of Israel is committing genocide against Palestinians. Palestinians will not be erased. Solidarity with all those outside of these walls in the streets protesting and exercising their right to dissent. <a href="https://t.co/TSbbXdv13U">pic.twitter.com/TSbbXdv13U</a></p>
— Rashida Tlaib (@RashidaTlaib) <a href="https://twitter.com/RashidaTlaib/status/1816200931848950184?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 24, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p>Outside the Capitol, thousands of protesters demonstrated against Netanyahu's visit, with some being kept back by police using pepper spray. Six protesters were arrested inside the House of Representatives before Netanyahu began speaking. While some lawmakers gave Netanyahu a standing ovation, others chose to stay away.</p>

<p>Netanyahu's US&nbsp; visit comes amid growing concerns over the humanitarian toll of Israel's nine-month ground invasion in Gaza, with Americans deeply divided on the issue. Netanyahu's speech highlighted the sharp divisions within the US Congress and the country at large on Israel's actions in the region.</p>

<p>In his address, Netanyahu said only military pressure can free the hostages and defeat Hamas, which launched a shock attack on October 7 that resulted in the deaths of 1,197 people, mostly civilians.</p>

<p>Netanyahu said he was "confident" in efforts to secure the release of the 114 hostages still in Gaza, where Israel's retaliatory military campaign has killed at least 39,145 people, also mostly civilians, according to figures from the Hamas-run territory's health ministry.</p>

<p>He also used his address to call for a global alliance against Iran, which he accuses of funding anti-Israel protests. He also slammed ceasefire demonstrators and praised President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump for their efforts towards Middle East peace.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;Soon after the attempted assassination of Donald Trump, local law enforcement officers and a U.S. Secret Service agent discussed how pictures of the shooter were shared among officers by a sniper who lost sight of him before he opened fire, a newly released video showed.</p>

<p>The three-minute video was recorded on the body-worn camera of an officer from the Beaver County Emergency Services Unit who was at the Trump campaign rally on July 13 in the rural western Pennsylvania town of Butler, and released on Tuesday by U.S. Senator Chuck Grassley.</p>

<p>The video shows local law enforcement officers and the Secret Service agent on a roof near the shooter's body about an hour after the attack discussing how photos of the gunman, 20-year-old nursing-home aide Thomas Crooks, were shared among law enforcement officers by a sniper who lost sight of Crooks before the shooting.</p>

<p>It was unclear from the video how long before the shooting the pictures of Crooks were circulated.</p>

<p>Crooks' bleeding body can be seen a few steps away from the officers on the roof. One of the officers gestures to a semi-automatic rifle near the body.</p>

<p>Crooks was able to crawl across the roof overlooking Trump's rally and fire eight bullets from a semi-automatic rifle before he was fatally shot by a Secret Service sniper on top of another building, according to law enforcement accounts. Crooks killed one man in the crowd and seriously wounded two others. Trump was wounded in his right ear.</p>

<p>Crooks' motive remains unclear. He registered as a Republican soon after turning 18. Before the attack, his internet search history shows him researching how Lee Harvey Oswald killed President John F. Kennedy in 1963, FBI Director Christopher Wray told a congressional hearing on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle, whose agency is responsible for the safety of U.S. presidents and other senior officials, resigned on Tuesday after her own congressional hearing.</p>

<p>Trump, who served as president from 2016 to 2020, is seeking to be returned to the White House in November's election.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>White House Press Secretary, Karine Jean Pierre emphasised that no one is more qualified to step in as the Democratic Party's presidential nominee than US Vice President Kamala Harris.</p>

<p>Jean-Pierre on Wednesday (local time) noted that Kamala Harris has been vice president for more than four years now.</p>

<p>"The vice president (Kamala Harris) has been vice president for more than four years. I do not see anyone more qualified to step in at this moment. She was a senator. She was an attorney general...," she said while addressing the White House briefing.</p>

<p>Jean-Pierre noted that Kamala Harris was a partner in that to the president, adding that President Joe Biden is proud to make this decision.</p>

<p>"I've listed out what we've been able to accomplish in the last three and a half, almost four years, an unprecedented record. She was a partner in that with the president. This is a decision that this president made, and I think he (US President Joe Biden) is proud to have made that decision...," she added.</p>

<p>Harris, over the past 3.5 years as vice president, has visited more than 19 countries and met with more than 150 foreign leaders, according to the White House website.</p>

<p>She has visited over 19 countries and met with more than 150 foreign leaders, according to information available on the White House website.</p>

<p>The US presidential election will take place on November 5, and Biden was seeking re-election to the post as the Democratic Party nominee. After his June 27 debate with Republican candidate Donald Trump, Democrats put pressure on him to withdraw from the race.</p>

<p>Following this, on July 21, Biden formally announced that he was abandoning plans for a second term in office and endorsed his running mate, Vice President Kamala Harris for the election.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Harris has quickly consolidated support among Democrats and has already secured the backing of enough delegates to be the likely Democratic nominee. Democrats adopted the rules the party will use to choose their presidential nominee, with voting to officially nominate Harris likely to begin on August 1.</p>

<p>Harris will have to secure the support of the majority of delegates at the Democratic National Convention (DNC) in Chicago in August.</p>

<p>Under the rules approved by the Democratic National Convention's rules panel Wednesday, presidential hopefuls have until Saturday evening to formally declare their candidatures and until Tuesday, July 30, to submit signatures from at least 300 delegates, with not more than 50 from a single state counting towards the threshold, reported CNN.</p>

<p>Voting will be conducted by electronic ballots sent to convention delegates. If only one candidate meets the petition requirements, which is likely considering how quickly the party has coalesced around Harris, voting is expected to begin on August 1, although it will be up to party leaders to set the times for voting to begin and end.</p>

<p>If more than one candidate were to meet the requirements, party leaders can set a period of no more than five days for candidates to make their case to delegates, reported CNN.</p>

<p>The party has said its goal is to nominate its presidential and vice presidential candidates by August 7 to avoid the possibility of litigation over ballot access in Ohio.</p>

<p>While the state has pushed its deadline for political parties to submit their official nominees to September 1, the new law won't take effect until the end of August.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Jill Biden later posted a letter on X thanking "those who never wavered" -- an apparent backhanded dig at the Democrats who called on Biden to quit -- and said it was "time to put that trust in Kamala."</p>

<p>Biden's withdrawal has upended Trump's campaign, which had previously focused on the president's age and mental acuity. Now it is Trump, 78, who is the oldest candidate in US history.</p>

<p>Trump, who had initially called for unity after surviving an assassination attempt on July 13, was in no mood for magnanimity after Biden's speech.</p>

<p>"Crooked Joe Biden's Oval Office speech was barely understandable, and sooo bad!" Trump said on social media.</p>

<p>Republicans have called for Biden to step down altogether, saying that if he is not fit to stand for reelection then he is not fit to serve as president.</p>

<p>Biden however insisted that he was no lame duck and that he would continue to work on the economy and key foreign policy issues for the rest of his time in office.</p>

<p>"Over the next six months I will be focused on doing my job as president," he said.</p>

<h3><strong>'Lunatic'</strong></h3>

<p>One key goal is a peace deal in the Middle East -- a legacy-defining dream that many US presidents before Biden have chased.</p>

<p>Biden, who has been increasingly critical over Israel's military campaign in Gaza, meets Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House on Thursday.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But in a sign of how quickly things are changing, Netanyahu will sit down separately that day with Harris as well, as well as meeting Trump in Florida on Friday.</p>

<p>The US election campaign meanwhile is moving ahead at full speed without Biden.</p>

<p>In his first rally since Harris secured enough delegates to become the de facto Democratic nominee, Trump hit out at Harris as his "new victim."</p>

<p>"She is a radical left lunatic who will destroy our country," he said, accusing Harris of hiding Biden's "mental unfitness."</p>

<p>Earlier, the White House denied there was any "cover up" over Biden's condition.</p>

<p>Harris was also on the campaign trail Wednesday, telling a Black college sorority in Indianapolis that "I am fighting for our nation's future."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Negotiations on a ceasefire-for-hostages deal in the Gaza conflict appear to be in their closing stages and U.S. President Joe Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will discuss remaining gaps on Thursday, a senior U.S. official said on Wednesday.</p>

<p>The official, briefing reporters ahead of their talks, said the remaining obstacles are bridgeable and there will be more meetings aimed at reaching a deal between Israel and Hamas over the next week.</p>

<p>Hamas-led fighters stormed into southern Israel on Oct.7, killing 1,200 people and taking 250 captives, according to Israeli tallies, triggering a war in which more than 38,000 people in Gaza have been killed.</p>

<p>Hamas and other militants are still holding 120 hostages; Israel believes around a third of them are dead.</p>

<p>Months of stop-and-start talks have failed to produce a deal to gain release of some of the remaining hostages.</p>

<p>The senior U.S. official said both Israel and Hamas still have some issues to resolve but that a deal is close in which a six-week ceasefire would take place in exchange for the release of women, elderly men and wounded hostages over a 42-day period.</p>

<p>"It's a very different negotiation now than just a month ago when we had some fundamentally unbridgeable issues," the official said.</p>

<p>Biden will hold talks with Netanyahu and then later in the day Vice President Kamala Harris will have a separate meeting with the Israeli leader.</p>

<p>Harris has taken over as the presumed Democratic choice for the November presidential election against Republican Donald Trump, after Biden opted not to seek reelection again under pressure from Democrats concerned about his mental acuity.</p>

<p>The senior U.S. official said both Biden and Harris are "completely aligned" on U.S. policy toward Israel and Gaza.</p>

<p>"The Israelis will hear full alignment," the official said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The gunman who attempted to assassinate Donald Trump at a campaign rally searched online for details about the November 1963 shooting of US president John F. Kennedy in the days before the attack, the FBI director said Wednesday.</p>

<p>FBI chief Christopher Wray, testifying before a congressional committee, said the gunman flew a drone over the venue where the former president was scheduled to speak about two hours before he took the stage in Butler, Pennsylvania, on July 13.</p>

<p>Wray told members of the House Judiciary Committee that investigators have not established a motive for the shooting but "we are digging hard because this is one of the central questions for us."</p>

<p>Trump survived the assassination bid, suffering a wound to his right ear, and a Secret Service sniper shot dead the suspected gunman -- named as 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks -- less than 30 seconds after he had fired eight shots.</p>

<p>"With respect to former president Trump, there's some question about whether or not it's a bullet or shrapnel that, you know, that hit his ear," FBI chief Wray said.</p>

<p>Two rally attendees were seriously injured and a 50-year-old Pennsylvania firefighter was shot dead.</p>

<p>Wray said Crooks "appears to have done a lot of searches of public figures, in general" but that there was no clear pattern to the research.</p>

<p>"A lot of the usual repositories of information have not yielded anything notable in terms of motive or ideology," he said.</p>

<p>"Starting somewhere around July 6 or so, he became very focused on former president Trump and this rally," the FBI chief said, and he registered that same day to attend the campaign event in Butler, Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>"On July 6, he did a Google search for, quote, 'How far away was Oswald from Kennedy?'" he said, a reference to Kennedy's assassination by Lee Harvey Oswald.</p>

<p>"That obviously is significant in terms of his state of mind."</p>

<p>The FBI director said no evidence has emerged so far that Crooks had any accomplices or co-conspirators and he seems to have been a "loner."</p>

<p>Crooks was perched on the roof of a nearby building and opened fire on Trump with an AR-style assault rifle shortly after 6:00 pm, as the Republican White House candidate was addressing the rally in Butler.</p>

<p><strong>- Drone flight -</strong></p>

<p>US Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle resigned on Tuesday, a day after acknowledging the agency had failed in its mission to prevent the assassination attempt.</p>

<p>Wray said Crooks flew a drone over the rally area for around 11 minutes -- sometime between 3:50 pm and 4:00 pm -- on the day of the attack.</p>

<p>He said it was not flown directly over the stage but about 200 yards (meters) away.</p>

<p>The drone and its controller were recovered in the gunman's car along with two "relatively crude" explosive devices, Wray said.</p>

<p>Another explosive device was found in Crooks's residence.</p>

<p>Wray said the gunman purchased a ladder on the day of the shooting but appears not to have used it. Instead, he climbed onto the roof using some mechanical equipment on the ground and vertical piping.</p>

<p>Wray also said Crooks's AR-style gun had a collapsible stock which may explain why he was not seen by rally-goers or members of law enforcement with the weapon before the shooting.</p>

<p>He said Crooks visited the rally site on at least three occasions: about a week before the shooting, for about 70 minutes on the morning of the rally and again that afternoon.</p>

<p>He purchased 50 rounds of ammunition on the day of the attack and visited a shooting range the previous day.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Donald Trump accused US Vice President Kamala Harris of being a "radical left lunatic" Wednesday, in his first rally since she became the de facto Democratic Party nominee in the White House race.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump launched a volley of attacks against US Vice President Kamala Harris Wednesday, calling her a "radical left lunatic" in his first rally since she became the de facto Democratic Party nominee for November's election.</p>

<p>In a speech claiming she was in favor of the "execution" of babies due to her stance on abortions, the former president and Republican nominee said: "She is a radical left lunatic who will destroy our country."</p>

<p>"We're not going to let that happen," he told the crowd in North Carolina.</p>

<p>Trump's speech comes as Harris, 59, hits the campaign trail armed with President Joe Biden's endorsement -- after his historic decision over the weekend not to seek reelection.</p>

<p>The 78-year-old Republican repeatedly attacked Biden over his age but has been forced to pivot as he has now become the oldest nominee in history.</p>

<p>Trump called Harris "the ultra liberal driving force behind every single Biden catastrophe."</p>

<p>He claimed that she wanted "abortions in the eighth and ninth month of pregnancy" as well as "right up until birth and even after birth, the execution of a baby."</p>

<p>Saying Democratic Party bosses were behind Biden's decision to step down, he accused Harris of covering up Biden's "mental unfitness."</p>

<p>Earlier Wednesday, the White House denied it had covered up any possible decline in Biden's health prior to his decision to drop out of the election race.</p>

<p>Harris's candidacy has stirred enthusiasm among Democrats after weeks of turmoil over Biden, who came under pressure after a disastrous debate performance against Trump last month.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

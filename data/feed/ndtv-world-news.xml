       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 17-year-old teenager in the US has been accused of deliberately causing a train derailment to record it and post it on YouTube. According to court documents, the Nebraska teen allegedly caused the train to go off the tracks, recorded the incident, and shared the footage on YouTube, <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://metro.co.uk/2024/07/25/teen-train-crash-derailment-record-youtube-video-nebraska-21299670/">Metro</a></em> reported.</p>

<p>The incident happened in April this year when the teen allegedly tampered with a rail switch, causing two locomotives and five fully loaded coal trains to veer off the tracks and crash into an empty coal car. He then alerted authorities to the derailment and asked the investigator who arrived what caused the crash. He told the investigator he was a train enthusiast and showed him the video he had shot of the derailment.</p>

<p>When authorities said they did not know the cause of the derailment, the boy said, ''Obviously a switch was flipped the wrong way.''</p>

<p>An investigator with BNSF Railway found that a padlock supposed to be attached to the switch was missing, indicating tampering. Three days later,&nbsp;a BNSF investigator obtained CCTV footage showing a 1996 Buick Park Avenue in the vicinity, with the same teenager walking towards the switch at the south end of the tracks. According to the affidavit, the teen was later recorded returning to his vehicle.</p>

<p>A <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q97XRpF6SZA">video of the derailment was posted on a YouTube account</a> believed to be linked to the teen, an investigator said. Authorities also discovered that a tripod had been set up near the accident site just four minutes before the train derailed. The derailment caused $350,000 in damages to BNSF Railway and the Omaha Public Power District, as per <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/teen-accused-derailing-train-recording-crash-posting-online-rcna163686">NBC News.&nbsp;</a></em></p>

<p>The 17-year-old was charged in Lancaster County Juvenile Court on Wednesday, but prosecutors have requested that the case be moved to adult court. He faces two felony charges of criminal mischief in connection with a train derailment.</p>

<p>''My office will file a motion to transfer the case to adult court and it will be up to the juvenile court Judge to transfer the case or have it remain in juvenile court,'' Lancaster County Attorney Patrick Condon told <em>McClatchy News.</em></p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>British Prime Minister Keir Starmer changed his travel plans to get to the Olympics on Friday after Eurostar trains were disrupted due to sabotage attacks against French rail networks, Downing Street said.</p>

<p>Starmer was meant to be travelling on the cross-Channel rail service from London to Paris for the Olympics opening ceremony, in his first visit to France since being elected earlier this month.</p>

<p>But a spokeswoman said he flew instead due to the delays and cancellations.</p>

<p>France is welcoming dozens of heads of state and government and royalty for the Olympics that begin with a dazzling ceremony on the river Seine on Friday.</p>

<p>Just hours before the ceremony, arson attacks threw France's high-speed rail network into chaos affecting tens of thousands of passengers, in what officials called premeditated acts of "sabotage".</p>

<p>One in four Eurostar trains were cancelled, the company said, with the disruption set to continue over the weekend.</p>

<p>Beyond the cancellations, Eurostar trains departing and arriving in Paris will run on regular lines rather than high-speed routes.</p>

<p>That would add an extra 90 minutes onto a Paris-London trip that usually takes around two hours and 20 minutes, Eurostar said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A few other quirky additions include IYKYK, which is the written abbreviation for "if you know you know".]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Informal words used as slang, such as 'boop' and 'the ick', are among more than 3,200 new words and phrases added to the Cambridge Dictionary in its latest update this week.</p>

<p>'Boop', which is defined as "a gentle hit or touch on a person's or animal's nose or head, showing that you like them or as a "joke", and 'the ick', which refers to "a sudden feeling that you dislike someone or something or are no longer attracted to someone because of something they do", are among the slangs to make it to the online edition for 2024 so far.</p>

<p>'Chef's kiss', or a movement in which you put your fingers and thumb together, kiss them, then pull your hand away from your lips as a way of showing that you think that something or someone is perfect or excellent, is another such informal phrase that has been recognised formally.</p>

<p>"Language is always changing, and this means that the 'Cambridge Dictionary' team stays busy researching new words and meanings that enter the English language," the dictionary said in a statement on Thursday.</p>

<p>"Many new additions come from the fields of science and technology, including 'scicomm' - the activity of explaining scientific work and information to people who are not scientists, or articles, talks, etc. that do this, and deep-sky - existing in or relating to the part of space outside the solar system," it said.</p>

<p>A few other quirky additions include IYKYK, which is the written abbreviation for "if you know you know". It is used mostly on social media and in text messages to imply a shared joke or shared knowledge with the reader that other people might not understand.</p>

<p>The noun "face journey" has been added to refer to "a series of expressions that appear on someone's face showing different emotions that they are experiencing as a reaction to something".</p>

<p>Cambridge Dictionary said its team records how English is actually used by real people and uses the Cambridge English Corpus, a huge collection of written and spoken English, to gather evidence for how a new word is used by different people and in a variety of situations.</p>

<p>"We also collect evidence of new words that have only appeared in English very recently. We feature three of these on our weekly About Words blog, where readers can vote on which words they think should be added to the dictionary," it explained, with reference the process behind adding on new terms.</p>

<p>Online gaming also inspired several new entries, such as 'backread' - to read through a series of messages or internet posts that you did not see when they were first created, often starting with the most recent, in order to learn what happened or was discussed earlier; 'speedrun' - to complete a computer game, or part of a computer game, as quickly as possible, especially by taking advantage of any glitches; and 'side quest' - a part of a computer game that has its own aim and story but is not part of the main game.</p>

<p>New additions from the world of music include 'soca' or a type of music that is a mixture of soul and calypso, originally from the Caribbean, and 'jug band' which refers to a small group of performers who play jazz, blues, or folk music on very simple musical instruments, especially using objects such as empty jugs as instruments.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After weeks of Israeli bombardment left them with nowhere else to go, hundreds of Palestinians have ended up in a former Gaza prison built to hold murderers and thieves.</p>

<p>Yasmeen al-Dardasi said she and her family passed wounded people they were unable to help as they evacuated from a district in the southern city of Khan Younis towards its Central Correction and Rehabilitation Facility.</p>

<p>They spent a day under a tree before moving on to the former prison, where they now live in a prayer room. It offers protection from the blistering sun, but not much else.</p>

<p>Dardasi's husband has a damaged kidney and just one lung, but no mattress or blanket.</p>

<p>"We are not settled here either," said Dardasi, who like many Palestinians fears she will be uprooted once again.</p>

<p>Israel has said it goes out of its way to protect civilians in its war with the Palestinian group Hamas, which runs Gaza and led the attack on Israel on Oct. 7 that sparked the latest conflict.</p>

<p>Palestinians, many of whom have been displaced several times, say nowhere is free of Israeli bombardment, which has reduced much of Gaza to rubble.</p>

<p>An Israeli air strike killed at least 90 Palestinians in a designated humanitarian zone in the Al-Mawasi area on July 13, the territory's health ministry said, in an attack that Israel said targeted Hamas' elusive military chief Mohammed Deif.</p>

<p>On Thursday, Gaza's health ministry said Israeli military strikes on areas in eastern Khan Younis had killed 14 people.</p>

<p>Entire neighbourhoods have been flattened in one of the most densely populated places in the world, where poverty and unemployment have long been widespread.</p>

<p>According to the United Nations, nine in ten people across Gaza are now internally displaced.</p>

<p>Israeli soldiers told Saria Abu Mustafa and her family that they should flee for safety as tanks were on their way, she said. The family had no time to change so they left in their prayer clothes.</p>

<p>After sleeping outside on sandy ground, they too found refuge in the prison, among piles of rubble and gaping holes in buildings from the battles which were fought there. Inmates had been released long before Israel attacked.</p>

<p>"We didn't take anything with us. We came here on foot, with children walking with us," she said, adding that many of the women had five or six children with them and that water was hard to find.</p>

<p>She held her niece, who was born during the conflict, which has killed her father and brothers.</p>

<p>When Hamas-led gunmen burst into southern Israel from Gaza on Oct. 7 they killed 1,200 people and took more than 250 people hostage, according to Israeli tallies.</p>

<p>More than 39,000 Palestinians have been killed in the air and ground offensive Israel launched in response, Palestinian health officials say.</p>

<p>Hana Al-Sayed Abu Mustafa arrived at the prison after being displaced six times.</p>

<p>If Egyptian, U.S. and Qatari mediators fail to secure a ceasefire they have long said is close, she and other Palestinians may be on the move once again. "Where should we go? All the places that we go to are dangerous," she said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Amid the ongoing conflict in Gaza, the ancient heritage site of Saint Hilarion Monastery/Tell Umm Amer in Palestine on Friday received the UNESCO tag and was simultaneously put on the List of World Heritage in Danger after an "emergency nomination".]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Amid the ongoing conflict in Gaza, the ancient heritage site of Saint Hilarion Monastery/Tell Umm Amer in Palestine on Friday received the UNESCO tag and was simultaneously put on the List of World Heritage in Danger after an "emergency nomination".</p>

<p>The announcement was made during the ongoing 46th session of the World Heritage Committee (WHC) in Delhi. India is hosting the key UNESCO event for the first time.</p>

<p>Saint Hilarion Monastery/Tell Umm Amer in Palestine has been inscribed on the World Heritage List and List of World Heritage in Danger, it was announced in the plenary meeting of the session.</p>

<p>Israel has been carrying out a massive military offensive in Gaza following the unprecedented and multi-pronged attacks on Israeli cities by Hamas militants on October 7.</p>

<p>India in November had urged both the sides to eschew violence, de-escalate the situation and create conditions for an early resumption of direct peace negotiations towards a two-state solution to the Palestine issue.</p>

<p>Friday's inscription has raised hopes about protection of such heritage sites.</p>

<p>The UNESCO in a statement later said that "this decision recognises both the site's value and the need to protect it from danger".</p>

<p>"In view of the threats to this heritage site posed by the ongoing conflict in the Gaza Strip, the World Heritage Committee used the emergency inscription procedure provided for in the World Heritage Convention," it said.</p>

<p>In accordance with the terms of the Convention, "its 195 States Parties are committed to avoid taking any deliberate measures likely to cause direct or indirect damage to this site, which is now inscribed on the World Heritage List, and to assist in its protection", the world body said.</p>

<p>The UNESCO said inclusion on the List of World Heritage in Danger automatically opens the door to "enhanced international technical and financial assistance mechanisms to guarantee the protection of the property and, if necessary, to help facilitate its rehabilitation".</p>

<p>The monastery of Saint Hilarion/Tell Umm Amer, one of the oldest sites in the Middle East, was founded by Saint Hilarion and was home to the first monastic community in the Holy Land.</p>

<p>Situated at the crossroads of the main routes of trade and exchange between Asia and Africa, it was a centre for religious, cultural and economic exchanges, illustrating the prosperity of desert monastic sites in the Byzantine period, the statement said.</p>

<p>In December 2023, at its 18th session, the UNESCO's Intergovernmental Committee for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict had already decided to grant "provisional enhanced protection" to the monastery under the 1954 Hague Convention and its Second Protocol.</p>

<p>The Palestinian delegation which included Mounir Anastas, Ambassador and Permanent Delegate of Palestine to UNESCO, thanked UNESCO for this dual inscription which seeks to bring a protective cover and world's attention to the heritage site located in areas facing conflicts.</p>

<p>"I am honoured to have this inscription taking place in the greatest democracy in the world. Thank you, India. I would like to express my deepest gratitude to all Committee members for their valuable support for this inscription," Anastas said in his statement made in the session right after the inscription.</p>

<p>He also thanked ICOMOS, an advisory body of the UNESCO, and the Secretariat of the UNESCO.</p>

<p>Various state parties from Lebanon, Turkiye and Kazakhstan welcomed the UNESCO inscription of the heritage site in Palestine, with some of them underlining the need for cultural heritage preservation in times of armed conflicts.</p>

<p>The nomination for the site of Saint Hilarion Monastery/Tell Umm Amer was an "emergency nomination".</p>

<p>Paris-based International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS) also made a presentation on this site.</p>

<p>The nomination dossier was submitted in June 2024 followed by a "desk review".</p>

<p>"Situated on the coastal dunes in Nuseirat Municipality, the ruins of Saint Hilarion Monastery/Tell Umm Amer represent one of the earliest monastic sites in the Middle East, dating back to the 4th century," according to the UNESCO website.</p>

<p>"Founded by Saint Hilarion, the monastery began with solitary hermits and evolved into a coenobitic community. It was the first monastic community in the Holy Land, laying the groundwork for the spread of monastic practices in the region. The monastery occupied a strategic position at the crossroads of major trade and communication routes between Asia and Africa," it said.</p>

<p>This prime location facilitated its role as a hub of religious, cultural, and economic interchange, exemplifying the flourishing of monastic desert centres during the Byzantine period, the world body said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bangladeshi police detectives on Friday forced the discharge from hospital of three student protest leaders blamed for deadly unrest, taking them to an unknown location, staff told AFP.</p>

<p>Asif Mahmud, Nahid Islam and Abu Baker Majumder are all members of Students Against Discrimination, the group responsible for organising recent street rallies against civil service hiring rules.</p>

<p>At least 193 people were killed in the ensuing police crackdown and clashes, according to an AFP count of victims reported by police and hospitals, in some of the worst unrest of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's tenure.</p>

<p>The trio were being treated for injuries that they said were caused by torture in earlier police custody at a hospital in the capital Dhaka.</p>

<p>"They took them from us," Gonoshasthaya hospital supervisor Anwara Begum Lucky told AFP. "The men were from the Detective Branch."</p>

<p>She added that she had not wanted to discharge the student leaders but police had pressured the hospital chief to do so.</p>

<p>Islam's elder sister Fatema Tasnim told AFP from the hospital that six plainclothes detectives had taken all three men.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel on Friday slammed a UN rights expert for "anti-Semitism" after she endorsed a social media post comparing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to Adolf Hitler.</p>

<p>Francesca Albanese, the United Nations special rapporteur on the rights situation in the Palestinian territories, has faced harsh criticism from Israel previously, especially after she in March accused the country of committing genocide in the war in Gaza.</p>

<p>On Thursday, she responded to a post on X, formerly Twitter, displaying a picture of Hitler being celebrated by a crowd with Nazi salutes and cheers above a shot of Netanyahu appearing to be greeted by US congressmen this week.</p>

<p>"History is always watching," Craig Mokhiber, a former UN human rights official who resigned late last October accusing the world body of failing to prevent the "genocide" of Palestinian civilians in Gaza, wrote in the post.</p>

<p>"This is precisely what I was thinking today," Albanese, an independent expert appointed by the UN Human Rights Council in 2022 but who does not speak on behalf of the United Nations, said in her response on Thursday.</p>

<p>Israel's foreign ministry was quick to respond, slamming her on X as being "beyond redemption".</p>

<p>"It is inconceivable that (Albanese) is still allowed to use the UN as a shield to spread anti-Semitism," it said.</p>

<p>Israel's mission to the UN in Geneva also chimed in.</p>

<p>"When a current UN 'expert' endorses Holocaust distortion spread by the former (UN rights office) director in New York... the system is rotten to its core," it said.</p>

<p>"It's high time to #UNseatAlbanese!"</p>

<p>Israel's new ambassador in Geneva, Daniel Meron, used the same hashtag, decrying that "Francesca Albanese abuses her (UN) title to spread hatred and inflammatory rhetoric".</p>

<p>Israel's top ally the United States also weighed in.</p>

<p>"UN Special Rapporteur's comparison of Benjamin Netanyahu to Adolf Hitler is reprehensible and antisemitic," US ambassador to the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva Michele Taylor said on X.</p>

<p>"There should be no place for such dehumanising rhetoric. Special rapporteurs should be striving to improve human rights challenges, not inflame them."</p>

<p>Albanese on Friday hit back at the criticism, insisting that "the memory of the Holocaust remains intact".</p>

<p>"Institutional rants and outburst of selective moral outrage will not stop the course of justice, which is finally in motion."</p>

<p>The Hamas attack that started the war on October 7 resulted in the deaths of 1,197 people in Israel, most of them civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.</p>

<p>Out of 251 people taken hostage that day, 111 are still held in Gaza, including 39 the military says are dead.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory offensive against Hamas has killed at least 39,175 Palestinians in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Spanish train driver and a former traffic safety chief at national rail infrastructure operator ADIF were sentenced on Friday to two-and-a-half years in prison over a train disaster that killed 79 people 11 years ago.</p>

<p>In Spain's worst rail accident in decades, an eight-carriage, high-speed Alvia 04155 train veered off the track on a sharp bend near the northwestern city of Santiago de Compostela, slammed into a concrete wall and burst into flames. Another 143 people were injured in the 2013 crash.</p>

<p>Presiding judge Elena Fernandez Curras said two elements caused the derailment: the driver got distracted when receiving a call, and there was no safety system in place in case the driver did not respect the speed limit.</p>

<p>The defendants and the insurance companies of ADIF and Renfe were sentenced to pay 25 million euros ($27.14 million) in damages to the victims in the civil part of the trial.</p>

<p>After the crash, ADIF identified more than 300 spots on the Spanish railway network where speed changes were needed.</p>

<p>The judicial investigation into the crash was complex and took years, and the trial ran for 10 months. Only two of more than 20 people investigated were eventually put on trial.</p>

<p>Fernandez revised down the official death count to 79 from 80 as she considered one of the passengers, who passed away weeks after the crash, died as a result of a serious illness he was suffering from, and not the injuries. His relatives will still be compensated as he was injured in the crash.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The World Health Organization is sending more than one million polio vaccines to Gaza to be administered over the coming weeks to prevent children being infected after the virus was detected in sewage samples, its chief said on Friday.</p>

<p>"While no cases of polio have been recorded yet, without immediate action, it is just a matter of time before it reaches the thousands of children who have been left unprotected," Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in an opinion piece in Britain's The Guardian newspaper.</p>

<p>He wrote that children under five were most at risk from the viral disease, and especially infants under two since normal vaccination campaigns have been disrupted by more than nine months of conflict.</p>

<p>Poliomyelitis, which is spread mainly through the fecal-oral route, is a highly infectious virus that can invade the nervous system and cause paralysis. Cases of polio have declined by 99% worldwide since 1988 thanks to mass vaccination campaigns and efforts continue to eradicate it completely.</p>

<p>Israel's military said on Sunday it would start offering the polio vaccine to soldiers serving in the Gaza Strip after remnants of the virus were found in test samples in the enclave.</p>

<p>Besides polio, the U.N. reported last week a widespread increase in cases of Hepatitis A, dysentery and gastroenteritis as sanitary conditions deteriorate in Gaza, with sewage spilling into the streets near some camps for displaced people.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Congress leader <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/topic/priyanka-gandhi-vadra" target="_blank">Priyanka Gandhi Vadra</a> on Friday ripped into the Israeli government over its war on Gaza - which is now into its 10th month and has killed nearly 40,000 people - and called on the global community to condemn Tel Aviv's "genocidal actions and force them to stop".</p>

<p>"It is the moral responsibility of every right-thinking individual, including Israeli citizens who do not believe in hatred and violence, and every government in the world to condemn the Israeli government... their actions are unacceptable in a world that professes civility and morality."</p>

<p>"It is no longer enough to speak up for civilians, mothers, fathers, doctors, nurses, aid workers, journalists, teachers, writers, poets, senior citizens, and the thousands of innocent children who are being wiped out, day-after-day, by the horrific genocide taking place in Gaza."</p>

<p>Her trenchant criticism of the Israeli government - which she called "barbaric" - followed Prime Minister <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/topic/benjamin-netanyahu" target="_blank">Benjamin Netanyahu</a>'s speech Wednesday in the United States.</p>

<p>"... we are subjected to the image of the Israeli Prime Minister being given a standing ovation in the US Congress," she said on X, "He (the Israel leader) calls it 'a clash between barbarism and civilisation'... he is absolutely correct, except it is him and his government that are barbaric."</p>

<p>"...and their barbarism is given unstinted support of most of the western world..."</p>

<p>"It is truly a shame to watch," the Congress leader said.</p>

<h3><strong>Israel Prime Minister's US Speech</strong></h3>

<p>Mr Netanyahu, addressing a divided US Congress on America's continued support - which has included military aid - declared the nations had to unite for "civilisation to triumph".</p>

<p>Hours before his speech there were massive protests in Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Crowds carrying Palestinian flags and placards gathered outside the Capitol calling for a ceasefire and Mr Netanyahu's arrest, even as prosecutors seek an international warrant.</p>

<p><strong>READ |&nbsp;</strong><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/israel-carries-out-new-raids-in-gaza-ahead-of-netanyahus-address-to-us-congress-6178865" target="_blank">Israel Carries Out New Raids In Gaza Ahead Of Netanyahu's Address</a></p>

<p>Israel has rejected accusations brought by South Africa at the United Nations' top court that its military operation in Gaza is a state-led genocide campaign against Palestinians. It has reacted angrily to a decision by the International Criminal Court's prosecutor to seek a warrant against Mr Netanyahu.</p>

<h3><strong>Israel Attacks On Gaza Strip</strong></h3>

<p>Meanwhile, as those protests were taking place, Israel carried out&nbsp;new raids.&nbsp;The attacks destroyed homes in towns east of Khan Younis in southern Gaza and thousands were displaced, residents said.</p>

<p>Some Palestinians - gathered at a hospital in Khan Younis before funerals for families and loved ones - criticised the United States, Israel's most important international ally, for welcoming Mr Netanyahu.</p>

<p>A day after his speech Mr Netanyahu met Vice President <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/topic/kamala-harris" target="_blank">Kamala Harris</a>, who is the presumptive Democratic nominee for the 2024 Presidential election. Ms Harris' comments seemed to signal a shift in American foreign policy, at least in the final few days of Joe Biden's administration.</p>

<h3><strong>"Will Not Be Silent": Kamala Harris</strong></h3>

<p>"What has happened in Gaza over the past nine months is devastating..." she said. "We cannot look away in the face of these tragedies. We cannot allow ourselves to become numb. I will not be silent."</p>

<p>"We cannot look away in the face of these tragedies. We cannot allow ourselves to become numb to the suffering and I will not be silent," Ms Harris declared.</p>

<p>The US this week said negotiations on a ceasefire-for-hostages deal were moving forward, and that Mr Biden and Mr Netanyahu would discuss the agreement during the latter's US visit.</p>

<p>India's Position On Israel-Gaza War</p>

<p>The Indian government last week reaffirmed its commitment to a peaceful resolution and its support for a negotiated 'two-state solution', which will lead to "the establishment of a sovereign, independent and viable state of Palestine, living... side by side at peace with Israel".</p>

<p>In May the government offered a stronger reaction, as it strongly condemned deaths of civilians and called the resulting humanitarian crisis in the region "simply unacceptable."</p>

<h3><strong>Hamas' Oct 7 Attack</strong></h3>

<p>Hamas-led fighters stormed into southern Israel on October 7, killing 1,200 people and taking 250 captives, according to Israeli tallies, triggering a war in which nearly 40,000 people in Gaza have been killed, most of whom are civilians and children, and millions displaced, many more than once.</p>

<p>Hamas and other militants are still holding 120 hostages; Israel believes around a third of them are dead. Months of stop-and-start talks have failed to produce a deal to gain their release.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar met his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov on the sidelines of ASEAN events in Laos' Vientiane on Friday.</p>

<p>In a picture shared by the Russian Embassy in India, Mr Jaishankar and Lavrov were seen sharing a laugh as they shook hands.</p>

<p>Russian Embassy in India stated on social media platform X, "#Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and #India's External Affairs Minister Dr S.Jaishankar @DrSJaishankar met on the sidelines of #ASEAN events."</p>

<p>Previously, the two leaders had met on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) Heads of State Council meeting in Astana. During his meeting with Lavrov on July 3, Mr Jaishankar raised "strong concern about Indian nationals" currently in the war zone in Russia. The two leaders also discussed the "global strategic landscape" and exchanged assessments and views.</p>

<p>In a post on X, Mr Jaishankar said, "Good to meet Russian FM Sergey Lavrov in Astana today. Wide ranging conversation on our bilateral partnership and contemporary issues. Noted the progress in many areas since our last meeting in December 2023."</p>

<p>"Raised our strong concern on Indian nationals who are currently in the war zone. Pressed for their safe and expeditious return. Also discussed the global strategic landscape and exchanged assessments and views," he added.</p>

<p>Earlier in the day, Mr Jaishankar, who is on a visit to Vientiane from July 25-28, participated in the ASEAN meeting. In his remarks, Mr Jaishankar said that political, economic and security cooperation with ASEAN is of the utmost priority.</p>

<p>Mr Jaishankar said that for India, ASEAN is the cornerstone of its Act East policy, the Indo-Pacific vision that was built on it and the people-to-people linkages that India is constantly seeking to expand.</p>

<p>Mr Jaishankar thanked Minister for Foreign Affairs of Singapore Vivian Balakrishnan, for his wishes on the former's reappointment and said he looked forward to working with him in the future. He also appreciated Balakrishnan's role as country coordinator.</p>

<p>As the Philippines will take over as the next country coordinator, Mr Jaishankar said that he looked forward to working closely with the Secretary of Foreign Affairs of the Philippines, Enrique Manalo.</p>

<p>He congratulated Laos for the chairmanship of ASEAN. "I extend our fullest support for the successful chairmanship [to Lao PDR]. I also thank our colleague and Lao PDR for the warm welcome and hospitality."</p>

<p>He welcomed Timor-Leste as an observer in the meeting. "Last year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that we will open an embassy in Delhi. We are proceeding to do so very shortly and in fact, we will be undertaking high-level visits there as well."</p>

<p>"I extend my deepest appreciation to all of you for strengthening ASEAN India relations through substantive and tangible cooperation identified under the ASEAN India Plan of Action," Mr Jaishankar said, adding that he looked forward to further discussions.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Franco-Swiss airport was evacuated for security reasons on Friday, hours after arson attacks disrupted the French rail network ahead of the Olympics opening ceremony.</p>

<p>"For safety reasons, the terminal had to be evacuated and is currently closed," the Basel-Mulhouse EuroAirport said on its website, adding that further information would follow.</p>

<p>Several French airports, including EuroAirport, had to be evacuated late last year due to a series of fake bomb threats.</p>

<p>EuroAirport, which is located on the French side of the border near Basel, welcomed eight million passengers in 2023.</p>

<p>The evacuation came as French authorities were hunting for the perpetrators of arson attacks on the high-speed train network, which disrupted travel for hundreds of thousands of people.</p>

<p>The Paris Olympics opening ceremony will begin Friday evening.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fifty days and counting, Indian-origin astronaut Sunita Williams remains in limbo, uncertain of when and how she may return to Earth. However, the US space agency maintains that she and the eight other astronauts on board the International Space Station are safe and in 'good spirits'.</p>

<p>An Indian space expert, speaking with a touch of humour, likened her situation to being in a state of 'Trishanku'-a state where one is indeterminably but willingly stuck between a rock and a hard place.</p>

<p>Today, NASA provided further updates, indicating that they are closer to identifying the root cause of the Boeing Starliner's malfunctioning systems, such as the failed thrusters and a series of helium leaks during its maiden test flight. However, there was no clarity on when, or if, Astronaut Sunita Williams and her crewmate Butch Wilmore will return, or if they will do so aboard the same Boeing Starliner spacecraft.</p>

<p>According to Boeing, the Starliner can remain docked with the space station for a maximum of ninety days, after which the batteries on board the spacecraft may deplete. As a result, US space technologists have approximately forty days left to determine whether Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore will return to Earth on the impaired Boeing Starliner, or if they will use SpaceX's Crew Dragon or the Russian Soyuz spacecraft. Both these standby vehicles are already docked at the space station, so neither Sunita Williams nor the other eight astronauts are truly stranded in space.</p>

<p>NASA Commercial Crew Program Manager Steve Stich noted that the crew is in good spirits and making the most of their time on the station as part of Expedition 71, given that both Sunita and Butch have previously undertaken long-duration missions. He added that `contingency plans' are in place, but the current effort is focused on bringing both Sunita and Butch back to Earth on the Boeing Starliner itself.</p>

<p>Putting a brave face on the situation, Mark Nappi, Starliner program manager and vice president of Boeing, said, "I'm very confident we have a good vehicle [in Boeing Starliner] to bring the crew back with."</p>

<p>Boeing has encountered several setbacks during the Starliner's development. Originally contracted for $4.2 billion, the company has now spent approximately $5.7 billion, with the mission still incomplete. NASA sought a second alternative to SpaceX's Crew Dragon, which is why Boeing Starliner was being developed. Boeing is also facing broader difficulties, with its aviation and aircraft business stumbling, and recently, Boeing CEO David Calhoun was questioned by US Senators regarding the company's safety culture and transparency during a US Congress appearance. If the Boeing Starliner fails to return the two astronauts to Earth, it would represent a significant setback for this aerospace and space technology giant.</p>

<p>In a statement today, NASA said, 'With ground testing of a Reaction Control System (RCS) thruster complete and disassembly and inspections concluding, the Starliner team is reviewing data that will aid in future missions and pave the way for NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Sunita Williams to return to Earth. A landing date for the Starliner Crew Flight Test (CFT) will be scheduled following the Flight Test Readiness Review planned for later next week, with landing opportunities available throughout August. Testing of the RCS thruster at NASA's White Sands Test Facility in New Mexico yielded meaningful findings for root cause assessments and to finalise flight rationale in support of a nominal undock and landing.</p>

<p>The Starliner team plans to hot-fire 27 of 28 RCS thrusters this weekend while safely docked to the space station. This test aims to verify thruster performance, similar to what would be done during future missions. The team also seeks another data point on helium leaks, which have remained stable since the spacecraft's arrival at the station on June 6. The helium system has been closed for most of the time while docked, so no helium is leaking in that configuration.</p>

<p>Boeing, in a statement, said, 'Additionally, NASA and Boeing will conduct a second docked hot-fire test over the weekend to demonstrate the spacecraft's thruster performance. The first docked hot-fire test occurred on June 15. The upcoming test will allow checks of the helium leaks while also verifying that the thrusters are operating as expected.'</p>

<p>While some glitches were anticipated during this maiden test flight, the extension of a ten-day mission to over five times its expected duration, with no end date in sight, is deeply concerning for the global space community.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pakistan's jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan will apply for the post of Oxford University Chancellor, Imran's adviser on international affairs, Sayed Zulfi Bukhari told Geo News.</p>

<p>Mr Bukhari told the Pakistan-based media outlet on Thursday that the Chancellor's post became vacant after 80-year-old Lord Patten resigned following 21 years of service.</p>

<p>Mr Khan, an Oxford alumnus, will run for the post despite being in Adiala Jail in connection to several cases of corruption and incitement of violence after elections last year.</p>

<p>Former UK Prime Ministers Tony Blair and Boris Johnson are Imran Khan's opponents in the race to become Oxford University's Chancellor.</p>

<p>Mr Khan was a student of Economics and Politics at Keble College, Oxford in 1972. He was also the captain of the university's cricket team. He debuted for Pakistan's Test cricket team in 1971 and served as the chancellor of Bradford University from 2005 to 2014, Geo News reported.</p>

<p>Mr Bukhari told Geo News that there is public demand for Imran Khan's candidature.</p>

<p>"We will announce it publicly once we get a go-ahead from Khan and start the signature campaign for it. He's the most suited person right now for this post and we hope he will win the contest. We await approval from Khan and the campaign will begin," Geo News reported, quoting Imran Khan's international advisor.</p>

<p>The Chancellor of the Oxford University is a ceremonial head who presides over important events. The university invited online applications.</p>

<p>The Chancellor is elected by Convocation, a body made up of all former students of the University who have been admitted to a degree (other than an honorary degree), members of Congregation, and retired staff who were members of Congregation at retirement, the Oxford University website stated.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former US President Barack Obama and his wife Michelle endorsed Kamala Harris' bid for president on Friday in a roughly one-minute long video that captured a private phone call between the couple and the current vice president.</p>

<p>"We called to say Michelle and I couldn't be prouder to endorse you and to do everything we can to get you through this election and into the Oval Office," Obama told Harris.</p>

<p>"I am proud of you. This is going to be historic," the former first lady told Harris.</p>

<p>Talking into a cell phone and cracking a few smiles, Harris expressed her gratitude for the endorsement and their long friendship.</p>

<p>"Thank you both. It means so much. And we're gonna have some fun with this too," Harris said.</p>

<p>The campaign said the video was the actual call, not a reenactment.</p>

<p>Harris's surprise bid against Republican rival Donald Trump continues to gain steam from supporters, donors and politicians less than a week after President Joe Biden bowed out of the race amid slumping poll numbers.</p>

<p>Obama, the first US Black president, remains one of the most popular figures in the Democratic party even after more than a decade has passed since he was last elected.</p>

<p>Obama has lent his support to Biden during big-money fundraisers, which were among some of the biggest blockbuster events of his campaign.</p>

<p>The endorsement could help activate and sustain energy and fundraising for Harris' campaign and it signals he is likely to get on the campaign trail for Harris once she is officially the presumptive nominee.</p>

<p>Obama initially withheld his endorsement even as Biden, his former vice president, anointed her as his heir apparent. Obama reportedly did not want to put his thumb on the scale as the party worked through the process of determining its nominee.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Paris is decked up to host a grand opening ceremony later today for the 2024 Olympics, but went into a tizzy after the rail network was crippled by "malicious acts".]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<ol>
	<li>Trains to and from Paris have been disrupted by what the government called a "massive attack aimed at paralyzing the network" of France's superfast trains.</li>
	<li>The "sabotage" occurred just hours before the opening ceremony of the 2024 Paris Olympics and has already affected over 8 lakh passengers.</li>
	<li>"Coordinated malicious acts targeted several TGV lines last night and will seriously disrupt traffic until this weekend," French Transport Minister Patrice Vergriete wrote on X (formerly Twitter).</li>
	<li>Fires were set off at several rail-line nodes, with people seen fleeing the sites in vans, Jean-Pierre Farandou, the head of the national rail company SNCF, said on BFM TV.</li>
	<li>"SNCF was the victim of several simultaneous malicious acts overnight. Arson attacks were started to damage our facilities," the national train operator said, adding that the attacks affected its Atlantic, northern, and eastern lines.</li>
	<li>SNCF urged passengers to postpone their trips and stay away from train stations.</li>
	<li>The train operator said that the situation would last through the weekend as they would have to repair the network cable by cable.</li>
	<li>International train operator Eurostar's services were also affected, especially those to London and Brussels from Paris.</li>
	<li>The disruptions come amid heightened security across Paris, with tens of thousands of police deployed to secure the Games. In preparation, large sections of the city have been cordoned off, with Olympic sites, train stations, and tourist landmarks guarded by gun-toting officers, including counter-terrorism units and the military.</li>
	<li>The opening ceremony this evening will see up to 7,500 competitors travel down a six-kilometre stretch of the river Seine on a flotilla of 85 boats.</li>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Several rockets were launched on Thursday and Friday against bases hosting troops from the US-led anti-jihadist coalition in Iraq and Syria, security officials and a war monitor said.</p>

<p>Such attacks were frequent early in the war between Israel and Hamas Palestinian militants in Gaza but since then have largely halted.</p>

<p>"Four rockets fell in the vicinity" of Ain al-Assad base in Anbar province, an Iraqi security source said.</p>

<p>Another security official said an attack occurred with "a drone and three rockets" that fell close to the base perimeter.</p>

<p>A United States official said initial reports indicated that projectiles landed outside the base without causing injuries or damage to the base.</p>

<p>All sources spoke on condition of anonymity because they are not authorised to speak to the media.</p>

<p>At least one rocket also fell near a base of the coalition in the Conoco gas field in Deir Ezzor province of eastern Syria, according to the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights war monitor.</p>

<p>The Observatory said a blast was heard in the area but there were no immediate reports of casualties.</p>

<p>The rocket was fired from "zones under the control of pro-Iranian militia" groups, said the monitor which relies on sources inside Syria.</p>

<p>There was no immediate claim of responsibility for either attack.</p>

<p>Iran-backed armed groups in Iraq have largely halted similar attacks on US-backed troops in recent months.</p>

<p>The latest attack come after a security meeting this week between Iraqi and US officials in Washington on the future of the international anti-jihadist coalition in Iraq. Iran-backed groups have demanded a withdrawal.</p>

<p>The US Defense Department said Wednesday "the delegations reached an understanding on the concept for a new phase of the bilateral security relationship".</p>

<p>This would include "cooperation through liaison officers, training, and traditional security cooperation programmes".</p>

<p>On July 16, two drones were launched against Ain al-Assad base, with one exploding inside without causing injuries or damage. A senior security official in Baghdad said at the time he believed the attack was meant to "embarrass" the Iraqi government before the security meeting.</p>

<p>For more than three months, as regional tensions soared over the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza, United States troops were targeted by rockets and drones more than 175 times in the Middle East, mainly in Iraq and Syria.</p>

<p>The Islamic Resistance of Iraq, a loose alliance of Iran-backed groups, claimed the majority of the attacks, saying they were in solidarity with Gaza Palestinians.</p>

<p>In January, a drone strike blamed on those groups killed three US soldiers in a base in Jordan. In retaliation, US forces launched dozens of strikes against Tehran-backed fighters.</p>

<p>Since then, attacks against US troops have largely halted.</p>

<p>Baghdad has sought to defuse tensions, engaging in talks with Washington on the future of the US-led coalition's mission in Iraq.</p>

<p>The US military has around 2,500 troops in Iraq and 900 in Syria with the international coalition.</p>

<p>The coalition was deployed to Iraq at the government's request in 2014 to help combat the Islamic State group, which had taken over vast swathes of Iraq and neighbouring Syria.</p>

<p>IS remnants still carry out attacks and ambushes in both countries.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Elon Musk's estranged transgender daughter, who he had alleged was "killed" by "woke mind virus", has "disowned" him. The world's richest man had claimed in a recent interview that during the pandemic, he was tricked into signing documents for "one of his older boys" Vivian Jenna Wilson. He had even referred to gender-reassignment surgery as "child mutilation and sterilisation".</p>

<p>Shot back Ms Wilson, the "entire thing was made up", in a long thread on Threads, the Meta micro-blogging rival to her father-owned X.</p>

<p>"I disowned him, not the other way around," said the 20-year-old.</p>

<p>She also shared the screenshot of an online post by Musk that claimed Wilson was born "gay and slightly autistic" - which the Tesla boss said were "attributes that contribute to gender dysphoria".</p>

<p>"I knew that from when he was about 4 years old and he would pick out clothes for me to wear like a jacket and tell me it was "fabulous!", as well as his love of musicals &amp; theatre. But he was not a girl," read Musk's post.</p>

<p>"This is entirely fake," shot back Wilson. "Like, literally none of this ever happened. Ever. I don't even know where he got this from. My best guess is that he went to the Milo Yiannopoulis school of gay stereotypes, just picked some at random and said "eh- good enough" in a last-ditch attempt to garner sympathy points when he is so obviously in the wrong even in his own fu**ing story."</p>

<p>Ms Wilson denied that she ever picked jackets for Musk.</p>

<p>"I was most certainly not calling them "fabulous" because literally what the f**k. I did not use the word fabulous when I was four because once again I would like to reiterate... I was four," she added.</p>

<p>She also claimed she did not have her father by her side when she was growing up.</p>

<p>"This entire thing is completely made up and there's a reason for this. He doesn't know what I was like as a child because he quite simply wasn't there, and in the little time that he was I was relentlessly harassed for my femininity and queerness. Obviously he can't say that, so I've been reduced to a happy little stereotype f*g-ing along to use at his discretion. I think that says alot about how he views queer people and children in general," said Ms Wilson.</p>

<p>She also sought to clear the air over her gender.</p>

<p>"I'm legally recognized as a woman in the state of California and I don't concern myself with the opinions of those who are below me. Obviously Elon can't say the same because in a ketamine-fueled haze, he's desperate for attention and validation from an army of degenerate red-pilled incels and pick-mes who are quick to give it to him," she said.</p>

<p>Musk had hit the headlines earlier this month with his claim about Wilson in an interview with conservative commentator Jordan Peterson. He had also accused those involved in promoting gender-affirming care of targeting children "who are far below the age of consent."</p>

<p>"I was tricked into doing this. I lost my son, essentially. They call it 'deadnaming' for a reason. The reason they call it 'deadnaming' is because your son is dead," he said, claiming that the experience set him on a mission to combat what he described as the "woke mind virus".</p>

<p>"I vowed to destroy the woke mind virus after that. And we're making some progress," he added.</p>

<p>Vivian Jenna Wilson had legally changed her name and gender at the age of 18. She had then asserted she does not wish to be related to Musk, her biological father. Her mother, Justine Wilson, had divorced Musk in 2008.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[There are people spending a lot of money to be on Santorini and they don't want the island to be swamped. Instagram has defined the way people choose the places to visit]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the most enduring images of Greece's summer travel brand is the world-famous sunset on Santorini Island, framed by sea-blue church domes on a jagged cliff high above a volcanic caldera.</p>

<p>This scene has inspired millions of fridge magnets, posters, and souvenirs -- and now the queue to reach the viewing spot in the clifftop village of Oia can take more than 20 minutes.</p>

<p>Santorini is a key stopover of the Greek cruise experience. But with parts of the island nearing saturation, officials are considering restrictions.</p>

<p>Of the record 32.7 million people who visited Greece last year, around 3.4 million, or one in 10, went to the island of just 15,500 residents.</p>

<p>"We need to set limits if we don't want to sink under overtourism," Santorini mayor Nikos Zorzos told AFP.</p>

<p>"There must not be a single extra bed... whether in the large hotels or Airbnb rentals."</p>

<p>As the sun set behind the horizon in Oia, thousands raised their phones to the sky to capture the moment, followed by scattered applause.</p>

<p>For canny entrepreneurs, the Cycladic island's famous sunset can be a cash cow.</p>

<p>One company advertised more than 50 "flying dresses", which have long flowing trains, for up to 370 euros ($401), on posters around Oia for anyone who wishes to "feel like a Greek goddess" or spruce up selfies.</p>

<h3><strong>'Respect Oia'</strong></h3>

<p>But elsewhere in Oia's narrow streets, residents have put up signs urging visitors to respect their home.</p>

<p>"RESPECT... It's your holiday... but it's our home," read a purple sign from the Save Oia group.</p>

<p>Shaped by a volcanic eruption 3,600 years ago, Santorini's landscape is "unique", the mayor said, and "should not be harmed by new infrastructure".</p>

<p>Around a fifth of the island is currently occupied by buildings.</p>

<p>At the edge of the cliff, a myriad of swimming pools and jacuzzis highlight Santorini is also a pricey destination.</p>

<p>In 2023, 800 cruise ships brought some 1.3 million passengers, according to the Hellenic Ports Association.</p>

<p>Cruise ships "do a lot of harm to the island", said Chantal Metakides, a Belgian resident of Santorini for 26 years.</p>

<p>"When there are eight or nine ships pumping out smoke, you can see the layer of pollution in the caldera," she said.</p>

<h3>- Cruise ship limits -</h3>

<p>In June, Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis floated the possibility of capping cruise ship arrivals to Greece's most popular islands.</p>

<p>"I think we'll do it next year," he told Bloomberg, noting that Santorini and tourist magnet Mykonos "are clearly suffering".</p>

<p>"There are people spending a lot of money to be on Santorini and they don't want the island to be swamped," said the pro-business conservative leader, who was re-elected to a second four-year term last year.</p>

<p>In an AFP interview, Tourism Minister Olga Kefalogianni echoed this sentiment and said: "We must set quotas because it's impossible for an island such as Santorini... to have five cruise ships arriving at the same time."</p>

<p>Local officials have set a limit of 8,000 cruise boat passengers per day from next year.</p>

<p>But not all local operators agree.</p>

<p>Antonis Pagonis, head of Santorini's hoteliers association, believes better visitor flow management is part of the solution.</p>

<p>"It is not possible to have (on) a Monday, for example, 20 to 25,000 guests from the cruise ships, and the next day zero," he said.</p>

<p>Pagonis also argued that most of the congestion only affects parts of the island like the capital, Fira.</p>

<p>In the south of the island, the volcanic sand beaches are less crowded, even though it is high season in July.</p>

<h3><strong>'I'm in Turkey'</strong></h3>

<p>The modern tourism industry has also changed visitor behaviour.</p>

<p>"I listened (to) people making a FaceTime call with the family, saying 'I'm in Turkey'," smiled tourist guide Kostas Sakavaras.</p>

<p>"They think that the church over there is a mosque because yesterday they were in Turkey."</p>

<p>The veteran guide said the average tourist coming to the island has changed.</p>

<p>"Instagram has defined the way people choose the places to visit," he said, explaining everybody wants the perfect Instagram photo to confirm their expectations.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 30-year-old California man was caught soliciting sex from a sex worker while his 8-month-old child was in the backseat of his car.</p>

<p>He was arrested during an anti-human-trafficking operation on East Holt Avenue, according to the Pomona Police Department,&nbsp;<a href="https://ktla.com/news/local-news/pomona-man-caught-in-prostitution-sting-with-his-baby-in-backseat/ ">KTLA</a> reported.</p>

<p>Police found the infant unharmed in the backseat when they pulled the man over. The Department of Children and Family Services took custody of the child, and the father is cooperating with the investigation.</p>

<p>The man, whom police referred to as a "sex purchaser", is facing charges of prostitution and child endangerment.</p>

<p>This disturbing incident is just one example of California's ongoing struggle with human trafficking. In January this year, the 10th annual Operation Reclaim and Rebuild resulted in over 500 arrests and the rescue of dozens of individuals, including children, across the state. Pomona was one of the cities involved in the operation, which targeted human trafficking and child exploitation.</p>

<p>The operation, conducted by more than 95 federal, state, and local agencies, targeted human trafficking and child exploitation, reported <a href="https://abc7.com/california-human-trafficking-arrests-los-angeles-county-sex-workers-la/14372756/ ">ABC News</a>. Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna announced that 539 arrests, including that of 40 suspected sexual traffickers or exploiters and 271 suspected sex buyers, were made.</p>

<p>In one operation, task force personnel conducted an undercover "sex buyer" operation on Holt Avenue in Pomona, resulting in the arrest of 12 males, including two registered sex offenders, on suspicion of solicitation of prostitution.</p>

<p>Los Angeles County District Attorney George Gascon noted that one of the challenges in prosecuting sex traffickers and sex buyers was that victims were often too afraid to testify due to safety concerns. Mr Gascon assured that his office worked to ensure victims' safety and protection.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The '#HandsOffMyPorn' campaign is warning viewers that prominent allies of Donald Trump want to ban pornography and lock up the stars who bring it to vivid, graphic life.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">Donald Trump may have become involved with a porn star, but if elected president he could try shutting down the entire industry, adult film stars are warning in a push to get young men to vote against the Republican next month.</p>

<p data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">The #HandsOffMyPorn campaign has spent $200,000 so far on ads to run on adult websites, warning viewers that prominent allies of Trump want to ban pornography and lock up the stars who bring it to vivid, graphic life.</p>

<p data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">And they want Americans to fight back at the ballot box.</p>

<p data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">"If you care about adult entertainment, if you consume or create adult entertainment, you gotta vote November 5," porn actress Siouxsie Q told AFP. "There's no two ways about it."</p>

<p data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">The initiative comes in response to Project 2025, a blueprint for reshaping the federal government should Trump, the Republican nominee, win the election.&nbsp;</p>

<p data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">Page five of the 900-page tome's foreword states: "Pornography should be outlawed. The people who produce and distribute it should be imprisoned."</p>

<p data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">Trump has tried to distance himself from Project 2025. But dozens of his allies and former administration members co-wrote the document, and Democrats have argued that many of its policies match his own positions.&nbsp;</p>

<p data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">The #HandsOffMyPorn campaign is aimed primarily at men, who are four times more likely to report watching porn than women, according to the Institute for Family Studies.</p>

<p data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">Just weeks before the extremely close US election between Trump and Democrat Kamala Harris, pollsters report a giant gender division among voters.</p>

<p data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">Trump enjoys a strong lead among male voters, regularly taking his machismo-drenched pitch to young men on right-wing podcasts.</p>

<p data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">Now, #HandsOffMyPorn's "public service announcements" are being played to users in battleground states like Pennsylvania, Arizona and Georgia, often just before they watch adult videos.&nbsp;</p>

<p data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">Stars like Siouxsie Q appear and say: "Hey, I know you're busy. I know you're doing something. Hold on. If you want to keep doing this, you really need to vote on November 5... Enjoy!"</p>

<p data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">Harris is not in any way affiliated with the #HandsOffMyPorn campaign, which is paid for by the independent Artists United for Change committee, noted Siouxsie Q.</p>

<p data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">"Hopefully, secretly, she likes what we're doing," she added.</p>

<h3><strong>'Lightning rod'</strong></h3>

<p>Crackdowns on pornography are nothing new for the United States.</p>

<p>But Holly Randall, a 26-year veteran of the adult industry, said she has never seen such a potentially devastating threat to the sector.</p>

<p>That even includes when her parents, who worked in porn during Ronald Reagan's crackdown in the 1980s, had to film hardcore scenes in secret.</p>

<p>"I've seen these attacks come and go.... Project 2025, is the most explicit iteration of wanting to completely outlaw porn," she said.</p>

<p>"Absolutely, I am worried about imprisonment," added Siouxsie Q, who made her name performing in feminist, queer and bondage films, before moving on to producing.</p>

<p>Porn stars also warn that the consequences could extend far beyond even their wildly popular industry.</p>

<p>According to Siouxsie Q, pornography is the "canary in the coal mine" for the freedom of speech guaranteed by the First Amendment. She pointed also to Republican-led banning of sex education books from school libraries.</p>

<p>And Randall said adult entertainment is a "lightning rod" for wider issues such as trans rights, same-sex marriage and even reproductive rights.</p>

<p>"It's always the easiest thing to attack, because it represents people's uncertainty and fear about the changing morals of sexuality and of gender fluidity," she said.</p>

<h3><strong>'Outlawed'</strong></h3>

<p>Trump has repeatedly claimed he has nothing to do with Project 2025.</p>

<p>However, a New York Times investigation this week found "well over half" of the document's authors had been in Trump's previous administration or on his campaign or transition teams.</p>

<p>Randall noted the irony of Trump -- convicted for fraud over "hush money" payments to porn star Stormy Daniels -- becoming embroiled in the movement, even if she suspects he personally "doesn't actually care whether or not it's outlawed."</p>

<p>"But it's the people around him, like (Trump running mate) J.D. Vance, these ultra-right-wing conservatives, who want to ban porn," she said.</p>

<p>Vance wrote the foreword to an upcoming book by Kevin D. Roberts -- the author of the Project 2025 section that calls for a ban on porn.</p>

<p>"I think Trump will easily step aside and allow that to happen," said Randall.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Karen Makishima is the only female running for Japan's ruling party in her 20-seat prefecture for the October 27 general election, reflecting the tough battle women face in breaking into the country's male dominated politics.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Karen Makishima is the only female running for Japan's ruling party in her 20-seat prefecture for the Oct. 27 general election, reflecting the tough battle women face in breaking into the country's male dominated politics.</p>

<p>Her Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has promised to narrow one of the widest gender gaps among lawmakers in the democratic world, but even with a record fifth of all election candidates being women, it and other parties will likely fail to hit a government target of 35% female lower house candidates by 2025.</p>

<p>While surveys show societal attitudes towards women in Japan are a barrier, some also say the ruling LDP, which has governed for almost all the post-war period, is not serious about shrinking the gender gap in lawmakers, citing its failure to implement bolder measures.</p>

<p>Only 16% of LDP candidates in the upcoming poll are women, compared with 22% for the opposition Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan (CDPJ), according to a Reuters' analysis.</p>

<p>Gender inequality may not be a top issue in the snap election, but the scandal-hit LDP, which also faces an upper house poll by July, needs every vote, both from men and women, with polls suggesting it may lose its long-held majority.</p>

<p>Between making stump speeches and posing for photos in her coastal constituency of Odawara, about two hours drive from the capital Tokyo, Makishima told Reuters that female candidates struggle to overcome societal views that the long hours and cut and thrust of Japanese politics is not for women.</p>

<p>"The biggest drawback of having a low number of female legislators is that it doesn't change the traditional perceptions, such as that women are not suited to politics," said Makishima.</p>

<p>Japan's perennial gender gap problem has become a source of international embarrassment.</p>

<p>It currently has just over 10% female lawmakers in its lower house versus an average of 30% in other Group of Seven (G7) advanced democracies, according to a 2024 G7 report. It ranked 118 out of 146 countries in this year's World Economic Forum gender gap report.</p>

<p>Last year the LDP set its own party gender target of 30% female lawmakers by 2033, but some gender equality experts say the party needs more concrete plans like gender quotas.</p>

<p>"The LDP's dominance is really key to why there are so few women in politics," said Emma Dalton, a senior lecturer at Australia's La Trobe University who has studied gender inequality in Japan.</p>

<p>Some of its lawmakers agree that its time for bolder action.</p>

<p>Tomomi Inada, a former defence minister, told Reuters she believed the party should consider implementing a quota system or set out a detailed plan for how it will hit its promised 30% female lawmakers by 2033.</p>

<p>"A realistic path, that's what we need," she said.</p>

<p>In an emailed response to Reuters questions', the LDP said it had no plans for quotas and limited scope to add female candidates in the election because many of its seats were held by incumbents. While parties must support women in politics, "a shift in societal attitudes is also necessary," the LDP said.</p>

<p>Distorted Democracy</p>

<p>The issues facing women in politics in Japan include gender stereotypes, difficulties balancing other commitments such as child rearing, and harassment, according to report issued by the government in 2021.</p>

<p>"When I've been out campaigning, people have kicked my signs, and when I have responded to discriminatory remarks some people have said, 'how dare a woman talk back!'," said Harumi Yoshida, the shadow minister for gender equality in the main opposition Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan (CDPJ).</p>

<p>Nearly 60% of female respondents to a survey of more than 5,000 local lawmakers in 2020-21 said they had suffered harassment from the public or colleagues versus a third of male respondents.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, newly-anointed Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba unveiled a new cabinet with just two women in what a rights group called a "clear backslide" in efforts towards gender parity. The CDPJ's shadow cabinet had eight.</p>

<p>In a letter to LDP leadership a week later, Inada and a group of other female lawmakers said the low number of women in parliament "distorts democracy itself".</p>

<p>The letter made several recommendations to improve gender parity in the election including ranking women higher on lists of non-constituency candidates selected by proportional representation, which gives them a better chance of winning seats.</p>

<p>A Reuters' review of those lists found higher rankings mainly dominated by men. The LDP said a record 39% of its candidates on the lists were female but declined to comment on their ranking.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Makishima, who won her seat by a large margin in 2021, remains hopeful for broader change.</p>

<p>"We are in a transitional period," she said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Russian troops are barely 10 kilometres from the city but in the cafe, the sounds of war are drowned out by the whir of the coffee machine.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">Inside her cafe in the frontline Ukrainian city of Pokrovsk, Anna appeared calm as she poured a capuccino, filling the room with the scent of Java roast. Russian troops are barely 10 kilometres (six miles) from the city but here, the sounds of war are drowned out by the whir of the coffee machine.</p>

<p data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">"Our defenders need us," the 35-year-old said, praising the many Ukrainian soldiers stationed in the city.</p>

<p data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">"They also want to have their good cup of hot coffee with a hot dog," she added.</p>

<p data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">Despite urgent calls to evacuate as Moscow's army closes in, thousands of people have chosen to stay in Pokrovsk, often elderly residents who have lived in the city their whole lives.</p>

<p data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">Anna's cafe, with its window display of candy-pink doughnuts, offers a brief semblance of normality to those who have remained.</p>

<p data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">It allows them to socialise and enjoy simple comforts while they try and deal with the trauma of living in a war zone.</p>

<p data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">Two weeks ago, the cafe's manager wanted to close the business, when Russian troops increased their bombardment of Pokrovsk, a key logistics hub, but Anna was adamant they remain open.</p>

<p data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">"We told him: 'Please, let us work!'" she said.</p>

<p data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">"The guys come by and say: 'Oh you're open. Thank God,'" she said of the soldiers.</p>

<h3><strong>'It's really scary'</strong></h3>

<p>In the eastern Donetsk region, overstretched and outmanned Ukrainian soldiers are ceding dozens of towns and villages to Moscow as the Kremlin ramps up its offensive.</p>

<p>Pokrovsk was home to around 60,000 people before the February 2022 invasion.</p>

<p>By October this year only 12,000 were left, many having fled since the summer, when Russian attacks on the city intensified.</p>

<p>Yevgen, a customer, said places like Anna's were essential.</p>

<p>"Thanks to them for continuing to work," the 52-year-old told AFP, tea in one hand and cigarette in the other.</p>

<p>"You can at least come, socialise, even meet friends here," he added.</p>

<p>"Everyone has to have their own place like that."</p>

<p>Pokrovsk doesn't have many similar spots left.</p>

<p>When Anna spoke about the many shops that had closed, her eyes filled with tears.</p>

<p>"It was all full of life," she recalled. Now, "it's really scary".</p>

<p>Anna has already sent her family away and her time in Pokrovsk is also running out. She reckons the cafe only has two weeks left before the situation becomes too dangerous.</p>

<p>Pokrovsk already looks like a ghost town.</p>

<p>Public transport is no longer running and most residents do not stay outside for long.</p>

<h3><strong>'Our pizza makers left'</strong></h3>

<p>Not far from Anna's cafe, one of the last restaurants still open advertises pizzas dripping with melted cheese.</p>

<p>But pizza is no longer on the menu, said Svitlana, 39, who works both in the kitchen and front of house.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Electricity has become a rare commodity, and the restaurant can no longer turn on its pizza oven.</p>

<p>"All our pizza makers left," she said, sighing.</p>

<p>Apart from that, "we have everything", she said, with pride. "Meat, first course, main course."</p>

<p>The restaurant also lacks running water, like almost the whole of Pokrovsk, so has to rely on a private well and bottled water.</p>

<p>But Svitlana is not giving up.</p>

<p>For local residents, many of whom have no electricity at all, her establishment with its generator makes it possible "to have a warm meal", she said.</p>

<p>'There's no way out'</p>

<p>Under the glare of a white fluorescent light, Svitlana served dishes to her eager customers, while the fridge was stocked with sodas and a few non-alcoholic beers.</p>

<p>The sale of alcohol is banned in several regions close to the front line.</p>

<p>At one table, 60-year-old Igor had just finished his soup.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He used to eat at the canteen at the mine where he works but he told AFP it was destroyed by a Russian missile.</p>

<p>Despite the risks, he still comes to the restaurant, which he said allows him to feel "like a normal person".</p>

<p>At the till, Valery, a regular, was waiting for his order.</p>

<p>"We won't let them go anywhere," said the 71-year-old pensioner with gold teeth, glancing at Svitlana.</p>

<p>At this point, the waitresses are "combat veterans", he smiled.</p>

<p>But he knows this cannot last.</p>

<p>A native of Pokrovsk, he plans to leave but keeps putting it off.</p>

<p>"I don't want to go anywhere. I don't want to leave everything. But there's no way out."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Billionaire and Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates has recently donated about $50 million to a nonprofit organization supporting Kamala Harris' US presidential run, the New York Times reported Tuesday. The donation to Future Forward, the main outside fund-raising group backing Harris, was meant to stay under wraps as Gates has not publicly endorsed the Democrat candidate, who is up against Republican Donald Trump in the November 5 US presidential election.</p>

<p>According to an <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/22/us/elections/bill-gates-future-forward-kamala-harris.html" rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">NYT report</a>, Gates, in private calls this year to friends and others, has also expressed "concern" about what a second <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/trump-targets-latino-voters-as-race-with-harris-enters-final-two-weeks-6849983" target="_blank">Donald Trump</a> presidency would look like.</p>

<p>His philanthropic organization, the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, is significantly concerned about potential cuts to family planning and global health programs if Trump is elected again, the report said.</p>

<p>Gates, however, has stressed that he could work with either candidate.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a statement in response to the NYT report, Gates stressed his bipartisanship, but also said that "this election is different."</p>

<p>"I support candidates who demonstrate a clear commitment to improving health care, reducing poverty and fighting climate change in the US and around the world," he told The New York Times.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I have a long history of working with leaders across the political spectrum, but this election is different, with unprecedented significance for Americans and the most vulnerable people around the world," he said.</p>

<p>In an interview with FRANCE 24 in July, when <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/kamala-harris-vs-donald-trump-campaigns-take-up-pace-in-final-stages-of-election-6843983" target="_blank">Kamala Harris</a> was made the new Democratic nominee after President Joe Biden dropped his re-election bid, Gates had welcomed the prospect of "somebody who's younger, who can think about things like AI".&nbsp;</p>

<p>While Harris turned 60 last week, her rival Trump is 78 and is the oldest nominee for president in United States history.</p>

<p>Gates' ex-wife and philanthropist Melinda French Gates had earlier publicly endorsed 60-year-old Harris.</p>

<p>According to Forbes, at least <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/billionaires-funding-kamala-harris-and-donald-trump-in-2024-6778853" target="_blank">81 billionaires have so far backed Harris</a> in her fight against Trump. But one of the world's richest men&nbsp;<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-elections-2024-elon-musk-donates-nearly-75-million-for-donald-trumps-presidential-cause-6807420" target="_blank">Elon Musk</a> is supporting Trump.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Taipei said Wednesday it had detected a Chinese aircraft carrier group sailing towards waters separating Taiwan and China, a day after Beijing held a live-fire exercise near the self-ruled island.</p>

<p>China considers Taiwan to be part of its territory and has ramped up military activity around the island in recent years to pressure Taipei into accepting its claims of sovereignty.</p>

<p>The Liaoning aircraft carrier group was spotted overnight in waters near the Taipei-administered Pratas Islands, about 400 kilometres (250 miles) southwest of Taiwan, and heading north towards the sensitive Taiwan Strait. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Chinese navy vessels "led by the aircraft carrier Liaoning, sailed through waters near Dongsha (the Pratas Islands) and continued northward toward the Taiwan Strait," Taiwan's defence ministry said in a statement on the social media platform X.</p>

<p>Taiwan's military "monitored the situation and responded accordingly", the ministry said.</p>

<p>The Liaoning took part in China's large-scale military drills around Taiwan last week that were condemned by Taipei and its key backer Washington.</p>

<p>China sent a record number of fighter jets as well as warships to encircle Taiwan in what Beijing said was a "stern warning to the separatist acts of 'Taiwan Independence' forces".</p>

<p>That was followed by an announcement that China would hold a live-fire exercise on Tuesday in an area about 105 kilometres from Taiwan.</p>

<p>Over the weekend, a US and a Canadian warship passed through the 180-kilometre Taiwan Strait, part of regular passages by Washington and its allies meant to reinforce its status as an international waterway.</p>

<p>Beijing condemned the passage as disrupting "peace and stability" in the strait.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel's army confirmed Tuesday it "eliminated" Hezbollah's Hashem Safieddine, apparent successor of slain leader Hassan Nasrallah, in a strike in a southern Beirut suburb three weeks ago.</p>

<p>"It can now be confirmed that in an attack approximately three weeks ago, Hashem Safieddine, the head of Hezbollah's Executive Council, and Ali Hussein Hazima, the head of Hezbollah's Intelligence Directorate, were killed along with other Hezbollah commanders," the army said in a statement.</p>

<p>Hezbollah has not yet issued a statement regarding the claim. &nbsp;</p>

<p>On October 8, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that the military has "taken out" Safieddine, without specifically naming him.</p>

<p>In an address to the people of Lebanon, Netanyahu said Israeli forces "took out thousands of terrorists, including (Hezbollah leader Hassan) Nasrallah himself and Nasrallah's replacement and the replacement of his replacement."</p>

<p>Late on Tuesday, the army said that Israel's air force "conducted a precise, intelligence-based strike on Hezbollah's main intelligence headquarters," in the southern Beirut suburb of Dahiyeh, Hezbollah's stronghold in the Lebanese capital three weeks ago.</p>

<p>The statement added that over 25 militants of Hezbollah were present in the headquarters during the strike, "including Bilal Saib Aish, who was in charge of aerial intelligence gathering".</p>

<p>A member of Hezbollah's decision-making body and a distant relative of Nasrallah, Safieddine was out of contact since Israeli strikes on Beirut weeks ago, a high-level Hezbollah source said at the time.</p>

<p>A source close to Hezbollah told AFP in early October that the deeply religious cleric Safieddine, who had good relations with Hezbollah backer Iran, was the "most likely" candidate for the party's top job.</p>

<p>Grey-bearded and bespectacled, Safieddine bore a striking resemblance to his distant cousin Nasrallah, but was several years his junior, aged in his late 50s or early 60s.</p>

<p>"We have reached Nasrallah, his replacement and most of Hezbollah's senior leadership", the Israeli army's chief Lieutenant General Herzi Halevi said in a statement late on Tuesday after the confirmation of Safieddine's death.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One person has died and dozens have fallen sick following a severe E. coli outbreak linked to McDonald's Quarter Pounder hamburgers, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said Tuesday.</p>

<p>The outbreak, which began in late September, spans 10 western states with most of the 49 cases concentrated in Colorado and Nebraska, the health agency said.</p>

<p>Shares in the fast food chain dropped more than six percent in after-hours trading following the announcement.</p>

<p>Ten people have been hospitalized, including one child with hemolytic uremic syndrome -- a serious condition that damages blood vessels in the kidneys.</p>

<p>"One older person in Colorado has died," a CDC statement said.</p>

<p>All affected people carried the same strain of E. coli and reported eating at McDonald's before developing their symptoms, with most specifically recalling having had Quarter Pounders.</p>

<p>While investigators have not yet pinpointed the exact ingredient causing the outbreak, they are focusing on slivered onions and beef patties -- both of which have been removed from restaurants in the affected states pending further investigation.</p>

<p>"Food safety is so important to me and everyone at McDonald's," said Joe Erlinger, president of McDonald's USA in a video message. "We've taken steps to proactively remove slivered onions, which are used in Quarter Pounders, in select states.</p>

<p>"We've also made the decision to temporarily remove the Quarter Pounder from restaurants in select states."</p>

<p>He added the majority of states are not affected. In affected states, other menu items including other beef products remain available.</p>

<p>The agency advised those who consumed a Quarter Pounder and developed symptoms of E. coli poisoning -- such as diarrhea, a fever over 102 degrees Fahrenheit (38.9C), and vomiting -- to seek medical attention.</p>

<p>Symptoms typically begin three to four days after exposure, and most individuals recover within five to seven days without treatment. However, some cases can become severe and require hospitalization.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>India's G20 Sherpa Amitabh Kant today spoke at the NDTV World Summit in Delhi where he mentioned that this will be "India's century".</p>

<p>Mr Kant highlighted how the world is mired in conflicts - both in Europe and in West Asia. While this is sad and unfortunate, he explained that it also presents India - a largely peace-loving and ambitious nation - with an opportunity to set up manufacturing hubs and encourage innovation.</p>

<p>"When you look around the world, there are 3 big challenges," he said, adding that conflict is the first.</p>

<p>"Europe was responsible for World War I, it was also responsible for World War II, and now we have had a war there for the last 3 years. 45,000 people have died in Europe," he said.</p>

<p>"Similarly, 350.000 people have died n the Middle East. The region is up in flames," he added, going on to say that because of these wars, "global value chains are disrupted."</p>

<p>The third, he said, is the "rise of AI and Machine Learning," adding that "Huge enhancement of production is needed. But you need international cooperation to have some pro-innovation regulations on that," he said.</p>

<p>India's road to becoming a developed country by 2047 will require immense ambition and a focus on manufacturing, urbanisation and "firing on all cylinders", Mr Kant said, adding that "India can't grow only on the back of services, it needs to become a manufacturing nation. 17.5% of your GDP comes from manufacturing, you need to take it to 25%."</p>

<p>The former NITI Aayog CEO further said that it India needs to be an integral part of global value chains. "You can't grow at rates of 9-10% year after year for three decades or more - that's what you need to do - so when we are talking of a 'viksit' (developed) Bharat or a $30-trillion economy in&nbsp; 2047, growing from 4 trillion to 30 trillion means that your GDP has to grow nine times, your per capita income has to grow 8 times and your manufacturing has to grow 16 times, that's the challenge. And to overcome that challenge, India needs to become a very integral part of global value chains," he said.</p>

<p>Mr Kant said India needs to export in a big way and that is why there has been a thrust on the production-linked investment scheme.</p>

<p>"You need 10,000 large manufacturing companies here to penetrate global markets. You need size and scale of manufacturing, and you need 12 Indian states to grow at 10% plus. So you need ambition and hunger in states to grow rapidly and you need large companies to penetrate global markets," he said.</p>

<p>"To my mind," he said "this is a huge opportunity for India in all 3 areas of growth. This will not just be India's decade, but will be India's century," he affirmed.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>U.S. President Joe Biden said on Tuesday Republican Donald Trump is a threat to Democracy and should be locked up "politically," as he exhorted Democrats at a New Hampshire campaign office to win the Nov. 5 election.</p>

<p>"We got to lock him up," Biden said to applause at a Democratic campaign office in Concord, New Hampshire. "Politically lock him up. Lock him out. That's what we have to do," he said.</p>

<p>Trump, the Republican candidate and former president, wants to disregard the safeguards of the U.S. Constitution, Biden said. "Our democracy is at stake" if Trump beats Democratic candidate Kamala Harris, he said.</p>

<p>Trump, when he ran for president in 2016, repeatedly presided over rallies in which crowds chanted "lock her up," referring to then Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. He did not discourage them from that chant.</p>

<p>This year, during rallies for Harris, her crowds sometimes chant "lock him up," referring to Trump, who has been convicted of 34 felony counts related to covering up hush money paid to a porn star. He also faces charges of illegally trying to overturn his 2020 election loss.</p>

<p>But Harris shuts down the chants, saying the Justice Department will handle that issue while she seeks to beat the former president at the ballot box.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>India's goal of becoming a $35 trillion economy by 2047 hinges on regional stability, said Ajay Bisaria, Former High Commissioner of India to Pakistan.</p>

<p>Speaking about India's stake in West Asian affairs at the NDTV World Summit, Mr Bisaria argued that India's role in promoting peace is crucial to mitigating risks to its growth trajectory.</p>

<p>Mr Bisaria highlighted India's efforts to improve relations with its neighbors, Pakistan and China. He noted that recent diplomatic overtures, including Prime Minister Modi's upcoming meeting with his Chinese counterpart and External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar's visit to Pakistan, signal India's willingness to stabilise these relationships.</p>

<p>When asked about the potential for further progress in India-Pakistan relations following Mr S Jaishankar's visit, Mr Bisaria stated that the aim is to stabilise, if not normalise, the relationship.</p>

<p>He emphasised India's desire to be a force for peace and stability in the region and globally. "We want to be the rising tide that helps all the neighbours. And to be an advocate and force for peace in the conflicts in the world", he said.</p>

<p>Tim Roemer, Executive Director of APCO and Former US Ambassador to India, echoed Mr Bisaria's sentiments, asserting that India can play a pivotal role in building a new architecture for regional cooperation and security. He highlighted India's significant diaspora in the Middle East and its growing economic interests as factors driving its engagement in the region.</p>

<p>Mr Bisaria also acknowledged the potential pressure on India-Iran relations due to the ongoing war between Israel and Iran.</p>

<p>He noted that the conflict has implications for India's diaspora, oil prices, and geopolitical interests.</p>

<p>The BRICS Summit, where Prime Minister Modi and Iranian president met on Tuesday, was an opportunity for India to address these concerns and potentially play a role in peacemaking efforts, he said.</p>

<p>He also said that "If we can play a role in peacemaking, we will. India's interest is this conflict ending as soon as possible."<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With the conflict in West Asia escalating significantly after Israel and Iran threatened each other of an endless series of retaliations, Prime Minister Narendra Modi today met Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian in Russia on the sidelines of the BRICS Summit in the city of Kazan.</p>

<p>India has expressed "deep concern" over the current situation in West Asia and has been calling for "dialogue and diplomacy" to de-escalate the tension in the region also known as the Middle East.</p>

<p>The meeting between the two leaders came amid the year-long Israel-Hamas war and the Israel-Hezbollah conflict, and after Iran's ballistic missile offensive against Israel led to Tel Aviv vowing a massive retaliation.</p>

<h2><strong>INDIA'S ATTEMPT TO BROKER PEACE</strong></h2>

<p>Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian emphasised the need for peace in the region and the "role that New Delhi could play in de-escalating the Middle East crisis," given its good relations with all the parties involved.</p>

<p>India, which has friendly relations with almost all nations, finds itself in a unique position to be able to mediate between Israel and Iran. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had spoken with Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu three weeks ago and has met the Iranian President today.</p>

<p>This is not the only case where New Delhi is trying to broker peace between conflicting sides. PM Modi is also trying to broker a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine which have been at war since 2022. Here too, Prime Minister Modi shares a strong bond with both Vladimir Putin and Ukraine's Zelenskyy.</p>

<p>PM Modi has visited Russia twice in three months and went to Ukraine as well in this period. He also reportedly sent a "peace plan" for President Putin last month when National Security Adviser Ajit Doval met the Russian President in Moscow.</p>

<h3><strong>CHABAHAR PORT AND INST CORRIDOR</strong></h3>

<p>During the meeting PM Modi and President Pezeshkian also discussed the India-Iran bilateral ties and ways to strengthen it. Among several key areas of cooperation, the two leaders discussed strategic projects like the Chabahar Port and the International North-South Transport Corridor or INSTC.</p>

<p>After the meeting, PM Modi shared a post on social media platform X, in which he wrote "Had a very good meeting with the President of Iran, Mr. Masoud Pezeshkian. We reviewed the full range of relations between our countries. We also discussed ways to deepen ties in futuristic sectors." He shared the same post in Persian too.</p>

<p><strong>WHAT MORE WAS DISCUSSED</strong></p>

<p>The Ministry of External Affairs gave more details about what the two leaders discussed, as Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri held a press briefing in which he said that PM Modi and President Pezeshkian held "fruitful discussions", adding that "Both the leaders discussed the situation in West Asia. Prime Minister Modi expressed his deep concern over the escalating conflict and reiterated India's call for the protection of civilians and the prevention of harm to civilians. He emphasised the need for dialogue and diplomacy to de-escalate the tensions."</p>

<p>Mr Misri further said that "President Pezeshkian emphasised the need for peace and harmony in the region and the role that India could play in de-escalating the conflict given its good relations with all the parties involved."</p>

<p>The foreign secretary went on to say that PM Modi congratulated President Pezeshkian on his electoral victory and also welcomed Iran to the BRICS forum, which it has joined officially from this year.</p>

<p>Speaking about the millenia-old ties between the two countries, the foreign secretary said, "Both leaders emphasised the shared historical and civilisational ties between the two countries and discussed ways to further strengthen cooperation."</p>

<p>"The discussion focused on key areas of cooperation, particularly the Chabahar Port and the International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC) which are crucial for enhancing regional connectivity and economic partnership," Mr Misri said.</p>

<h3><strong>REDEVELOPMENT OF AFGHANISTAN</strong></h3>

<p>In a statement about the bilateral talks, the Ministry of External Affairs said in its statement that the two leaders noted that "The signing of the long-term contract of Chabahar Port is an important milestone in bilateral relations."</p>

<p>It further stated that the two leaders reaffirmed its significance for reconstruction and redevelopment of Afghanistan and enhancing trade and economic linkages with Central Asia."</p>

<h3><strong>INDIA'S SUPPORT TO IRAN</strong></h3>

<p>President Pezeshkian acknowledged India's role in Iran's accession to the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation or SCO and BRICS forums. "They agreed to continue their cooperation in various international forums," the foreign secretary said at the press briefing.</p>

<p>The foreign ministry said that "Prime Minister Narendra Modi has invited Iranian President Pezeshkian to visit India at an early date," adding that "President Pezeshkian has accepted the invitation."</p>

<p>This was their first meeting after Mr Pezeshkian became President of Iran in July. He succeeded President Ebrahim Raisi, who died in a helicopter crash in May.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US Secretary of State Antony Blinken told Israel's leadership on Tuesday that the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar presented an "important opportunity" to end the war in Gaza.</p>

<p>"I believe very much that the death of Sinwar does create an important opportunity to bring the hostages home, to bring the war to an end and to ensure Israel's security," Blinken said as he met Israeli President Isaac Herzog following talks with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.</p>

<p>Blinken also met with families of hostages who are still held in Gaza since the October 7, 2023 attack by Hamas sparked the war.</p>

<p>Herzog, who holds a largely ceremonial role, agreed that Israel's killing of Sinwar could change the dynamic.</p>

<p>"Following the killing of Sinwar and the other circumstances that have evolved, there is a unique opportunity to make a special effort to employ all tools necessary and possible to move forward and bring the hostages back home," Herzog said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The FBI announced Tuesday it was investigating the alleged leak of classified US intelligence documents about Israel's plans for a retaliatory strike on Iran.</p>

<p>Iran has been bracing for a response since it unleashed a wave of close to 200 ballistic missiles on Israel on October 1 in retaliation for the killings of Tehran-backed senior figures in Hamas and Hezbollah.</p>

<p>The classified documents, circulated on the Telegram app last week by an account called Middle East Spectator, describe Israeli preparations for a possible strike -- but do not identify any actual targets.</p>

<p>"The FBI is investigating the alleged leak of classified documents and working closely with our partners in the Department of Defense and Intelligence Community," the FBI said in a statement.</p>

<p>White House national security spokesman John Kirby told reporters on Monday that US authorities were unaware if the documents had been leaked or hacked.</p>

<p>"We're not exactly sure how these documents found their way into the public domain," Kirby said, adding that such a leak would be "unacceptable."</p>

<p>President Joe Biden had indicated last week that his administration was privy to Israel's plans, answering "yes and yes" to a reporter who asked if he had "a good understanding" of how and when Israel would respond.</p>

<p>Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump seized upon the apparent leak Tuesday, painting it as an example of government incompetence.</p>

<p>"They leaked all the information about the way that Israel is going to fight, and how they're going to fight, and where they're going to go," the former US president said, exaggerating the actual content of the classified material.</p>

<p>"Can you imagine somebody doing that? That's the enemy, I guess, that maybe is the enemy from within," Trump said -- using a formula for describing political opponents that has become a persistent refrain at his campaign events.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Days after External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar's visit to Pakistan for the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation or SCO meeting, India and Pakistan on Tuesday agreed to renew the agreement on the Kartarpur corridor for another five years. However, the issue of Islamabad charging a fee of $20 per pilgrim, per visit still persists.</p>

<p>Gurdwara Darbar Sahib Kartarpur, often called just Kartarpur Sahib, is one of the holiest shrines for Sikhs. That is because Sikh Guru, Guru Nanak Dev preached there during the last eighteen years of his life.</p>

<p>After Partition of India in 1947, Kartarpur Sahib fell on the Pakistan side of the International Border. With India being the home for more than 95 per cent of all Sikhs globally, pilgrims from all over India always demanded access to go to Kartarpur Sahib, which is in Shakargarh Tehsil, Narowal District, in Pakistan's Punjab Province.</p>

<p>On October 24, 2019, India and Pakistan signed an agreement to facilitate the visit of pilgrims from India to Gurdwara Darbar Sahib Kartarpur through the Kartarpur Sahib Corridor. This was initially signed for a period of five years. This has now been renewed for another 5-year term.</p>

<p>"It has been agreed between India and Pakistan through diplomatic channels to extend the validity of the Agreement on Sri Kartarpur Sahib Corridor for a further period of five years," the Ministry of External Affairs said.</p>

<p>"Extension of the validity of this agreement will ensure uninterrupted operation of the Corridor for use by the pilgrims from India to visit the holy Gurdwara in Pakistan," it added.</p>

<p>External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar also posted about it on social media platform X, writing "India and Pakistan have renewed the agreement on Sri Kartarpur Sahib Corridor for the next five years. PM @narendramodi's government will continue to facilitate our Sikh community's access to their holy sites."</p>

<p>During his recent 24-hour visit to Pakistan for the SCO Summit, Mr Jaishankar held no bilateral meeting with his Pakistani counterpart, nor was there any official meeting. He however, greeted the Prime Minister of Pakistan, Shehbaz Sharif, when the latter welcomed him to a state dinner organised of all SCO delegates. Mr Jaishankar also reportedly had a brief exchange of greetings with his counterpart Ishaq Dar at the official dinner. However, no official talks were held and no note takers were present either.</p>

<h2><strong>FEE WAIVER REQUEST</strong></h2>

<p>Pakistan has been levying a fee of $20 per pilgrim, per visit for them to visit the holy shrine. Devotees from India have been urging the Government of India to try and get this fee waived by Islamabad. However, there has been no breakthrough in this regard.</p>

<p>"In view of the continued requests of the pilgrims regarding the removal of USD 20 service charge levied by Pakistan per pilgrim per visit, India has once again urged Pakistan to not levy any fee or charges on the pilgrims," the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said in its statement.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>India on Tuesday scrapped the export tax on parboiled rice, the government said in an official order, as inventories in the world's biggest exporter of the grain surged and the country is set to produce a bumper crop after copious monsoon rains.</p>

<p>Tuesday's decision to remove the tax follows last month's move to reduce the duty to 10% from 20% to boost exports.</p>

<p>Last month India also gave the go ahead for exports of non-basmati white rice to resume. But New Delhi set a floor price for non-basmati white rice exports at $490 a metric ton.</p>

<p>Bigger rice shipments from India would beef up overall global supplies and soften international prices by forcing other major exporters - such as Pakistan, Thailand and Vietnam - to reduce their rates, trade and industry officials said.</p>

<p>The decision to remove the export tax on parboiled rice signals the government's confidence about the new season crop, said Dev Garg, vice-president of the Indian Rice Exporters Association.</p>

<p>Duty-free exports of parboiled rice would encourage price-sensitive African buyers to step up purchases from India, said B.V. Krishna Rao, president of the Rice Exporters' Association.</p>

<p>India also scrapped the 10% export duty on husked brown rice and rice paddy, the order said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A much-awaited posthumous memoir by Russian dissident Alexei Navalny was published worldwide on Tuesday, containing sometimes humorous descriptions of his life including his time in prison and the now-famous prediction that he expected to die there.</p>

<p>Navalny, the top opponent of Russian President Vladimir Putin, began writing "Patriot: A Memoir" after his near-fatal poisoning in 2020.</p>

<p>The book recounts his youth, activism, personal life and his fight against Putin's increasingly authoritarian hold on Russia.</p>

<p>Navalny worked on the manuscript and diaries that form the basis of the book until his death, aged 47, eight months ago.</p>

<p>US magazine The New Yorker and The Times of Britain published excerpts from the book earlier this month, including Navalny's chilling expectation of his own death.</p>

<p>"I will spend the rest of my life in prison and die here," he wrote on March 22, 2022.</p>

<p>"There will not be anybody to say goodbye to... All anniversaries will be celebrated without me. I'll never see my grandchildren."</p>

<p>Navalny had been serving a 19-year prison sentence on "extremism" charges in an Arctic penal colony.</p>

<p>His death on February 16 at age 47 drew widespread condemnation, with many blaming Putin.</p>

<p>Navalny was arrested in January 2021 upon returning to Russia after suffering major health problems from being poisoned in 2020.</p>

<p>"The only thing we should fear is that we will surrender our homeland to be plundered by a gang of liars, thieves, and hypocrites," he wrote on January 17, 2022.</p>

<p>In a lucid, and sometimes lighthearted, tone Navalny also talks about matters far from politics or activism, such as his taste for cartoons, and the love for his wife, Yulia Navalnaya.</p>

<p><strong>'Cheery stoicism'</strong></p>

<p>He also describes the drudgery, and pointlessness of daily prison routines: "At work, you sit for seven hours at the sewing machine on a stool below knee height," he wrote.</p>

<p>"After work, you continue to sit for a few hours on a wooden bench under a portrait of Putin. This is called 'disciplinary activity.'"</p>

<p>Looking back at his childhood, Navalny remembered that the absence of chewing gum in the Soviet Union seemed to him to indicate his country's inferiority on the world stage.</p>

<p>After the breakup of the Soviet Union, Navalny the student observed the corruption among university professors and the wealth grab by oligarchs in the new Russia.</p>

<p>Whatever hope he may have put in post-Soviet Russia's political elite evaporated with Boris Yeltsin, whom he calls a drunk surrounded by thugs, and Dmitry Medvedev, president between 2008 and 2012, whom he calls both corrupt and stupid.</p>

<p>Navalny said he hated Putin, not only because he targeted him personally, but also because he thought the president had deprived Russia of two decades of development.</p>

<p>In an entry dated January 17, 2024, Navalny responds to the question put to him by his fellow inmates and prison guards: why did he come back to Russia?</p>

<p>"I don't want to give up my country or betray it. If your convictions mean something, you must be prepared to stand up for them and make sacrifices if necessary," he said.</p>

<p>In the Arctic colony where he was sent in December 2023, walks longer than half an hour were impossible because of the bitter cold, Navalny writes.</p>

<p>On February 16, 2024, he was declared dead, under unclear circumstances.</p>

<p>"'Patriot' reveals less about Navalny's politics than it does about his fundamental decency, his wry sense of humor and his (mostly) cheery stoicism under conditions that would flatten a lesser person," the New York Times said.</p>

<p>"It is important to publish these kinds of books," said Caroline Babulle, at the book's French publishers Robert Laffont, which has printed a first run of 60,000 copies.</p>

<p>"Patriot", which had a worldwide run of several hundred thousand copies, topped Amazon.com's list of bestselling books on Tuesday.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rock legend Bruce Springsteen will hold a concert and rally with former President Barack Obama in Atlanta and Philadelphia in the coming days as part of a series of get-out-the-vote events for Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign in battleground states, a senior campaign official said on Tuesday.</p>

<p>With early voting under way, the Harris campaign is betting these surrogate rallies will help drive enthusiasm and turn out voters in states that will decide November's tightly-contested election between Democrat Harris and Republican rival Donald Trump.</p>

<p>The 75-year-old rock star is expected to play some of his most popular songs such as "Born to Run" on Thursday in Atlanta in a campaign event with Harris and Obama. The event will mark the first time Harris and Obama have appeared together this campaign.</p>

<p>On Monday, Springsteen will appear in Philadelphia with Obama, the senior campaign official said.</p>

<p>In 2016, Springsteen played a three-song set at a rally in front of 20,000 people at Philadelphia's Independence Hall for Democrat Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign on the eve of the election. In 2008, Springsteen played a seven-song set for tens of thousands of people on the city's Benjamin Franklin Parkway to encourage voter registration and rally for Obama's campaign.</p>

<p>In October, Springsteen announced his support for Harris saying she and her running mate Tim Walz have "a vision of this country that respects and includes everyone, regardless of class, religion, race, your political point of view or sexual identity, and they want to grow our economy in a way that benefits all."</p>

<p>Taylor Swift, Pink, Oprah Winfrey, George Clooney, and many other celebrities have endorsed Harris and Walz. Celebrities endorsing Trump include Hulk Hogan, Kid Rock, Jason Aldean, Russell Brand, Amber Rose, among others.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Idris Abdurashidov, a Russian mixed martial arts boxer, was banned from fighting for life after knocking out his opponent with an illegal head kick on October 20 during his professional boxing debut in Phuket, Thailand. The 21-year-old, who has a 4-0 record and is unbeaten in mixed martial arts, is well-known for his ability to knock out opponents in MMA, but he made a risky switch to boxing rules.</p>

<p>By the fourth round of his bout with Iranian boxer Bagher Faraji, Abdurashidov seemed to be having trouble. In a startling turn of events, Faraji was immediately floored by the Russian fighter's MMA-style head kick. Both officials and onlookers were taken aback by this unlawful action.</p>

<p>Later, Abdurashidov boasted about his feat on social media while posting the knockout footage, which heightened the debate.&nbsp;</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the tightest US election races of modern times enters its final, two-week stretch Tuesday, with Republican Donald Trump making a special pitch to Latino voters as Democratic rival Kamala Harris sits down for a national network interview.</p>

<p>Both campaigns are pumping hundreds of millions of dollars into a final push for any wavering, undecided voters who could tilt the balance in their favor, with polls consistently showing their candidates in a dead heat ahead of Election Day.</p>

<p>Whatever the outcome, Americans will make history on November 5: they will either elect the first woman president in the world's leading superpower -- or they will put the first convicted felon into the White House.</p>

<p>Polls appear to be giving Trump, who at 78 is the oldest nominee from a major party in US history, a slight edge recently -- but all within the margin of error, making them little comfort for a former president making his third consecutive White House run.</p>

<p>Vice President Harris -- who only threw herself into the race in July, when President Joe Biden made the stunning decision to drop out and endorse her instead -- will give a television interview to NBC on Tuesday.</p>

<p>The 60-year-old, who celebrated her birthday over the weekend, will also deploy one of her party's most popular emissaries back into the field: Barack Obama.</p>

<p>The former Democratic president will hold a series of rallies in Wisconsin and Michigan, two of the seven most hotly contested swing states in the election which, under the US system of indirect universal suffrage, are likely to decide the outcome.</p>

<p><strong>15 million ballots cast</strong></p>

<p>Trump, whose anti-migrant rhetoric is becoming coarser and more extreme by the day, will take part in a roundtable discussion with Latino voters at one of his Florida properties.</p>

<p>The Republican will then fly to North Carolina, another swing state where he also campaigned on Monday, for an event that is supposed to be devoted to the economy.</p>

<p>He rarely sticks to the topic at his rallies, however -- instead, he has been criticized for a tumultuous few weeks that have featured rambling monologues and threats about weaponizing the military against Democrats who he calls "the enemy from within."</p>

<p>One recent televised town hall veered into a surreal, impromptu music session as Trump abandoned discussion of the election to play his favorite hits while swaying on stage.</p>

<p>The Harris campaign has begun to hammer at his mental and physical fitness to serve.</p>

<p>But a tide of MAGA-capped supporters continue to flock to his rallies, convinced that he is the victim of political persecution, or that Democrats are instigating threats against him.</p>

<p>Democrats are also seeking to woo moderate Republicans turned off by Trump's ominous rhetoric and scandals.</p>

<p>Harris has sought to frame herself as a "joyful warrior" seeking to turn the page on Trump's years of outrage and move into a new generation of American political leadership.</p>

<p>More than 15 million Americans have already voted by mail or in person, according to the independent organization Elections Project, representing around 10 percent of the total turnout in 2020.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chinese President Xi Jinping told Russia's Vladimir Putin that the international situation was gripped by chaos but that Beijing's strategic partnership with Moscow was a force for stability amid the most significant changes seen in a century.</p>

<p>Xi and Putin in May pledged a "new era" of partnership between the two most powerful rivals of the United States, which they cast as an aggressive Cold War hegemon sowing chaos across the world.</p>

<p>"At present, the world is going through changes unseen in a hundred years, the international situation is intertwined with chaos," Xi told Putin in the Russian city of Kazan at the opening of the BRICS summit.</p>

<p>"But I firmly believe that the friendship between China and Russia will continue for generations, and great countries' responsibility to their people will not change."</p>

<p>Russia, waging war against NATO-supplied Ukrainian forces, and China, under pressure from a concerted U.S. effort to counter its growing military and economic strength, increasingly have found common geopolitical cause.</p>

<p>Russia and China, pushing back against perceived humiliations of the 1991 Soviet collapse and centuries of European colonial dominance of China, have sought to portray the West as decadent and in decline.</p>

<p>The United States casts China as its biggest competitor and Russia as its biggest nation-state threat, and President Joe Biden has said the democracies face a challenge from autocracies such as China and Russia.</p>

<p>Biden has referred to Xi as a "dictator" and has said Putin is a "killer" and even a "crazy SOB". Beijing and Moscow have scolded Biden for the comments.</p>

<p>Putin called Xi "dear friend" and said the partnership with China was a force for stability in the world.</p>

<p>"Russian-Chinese cooperation in world affairs is one of the main stabilising factors on the world stage," Putin said.</p>

<p>"We intend to further enhance coordination on all multilateral platforms in order to ensure global security and a just world order."</p>

<p>Xi said cooperation in the BRICS group was "the most important platform for solidarity and cooperation between emerging market countries and developing countries in the world today."</p>

<p>He said it was "a mainstay force in promoting the realization of equal and orderly global multipolarity, as well as inclusive and tolerant economic globalisation."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

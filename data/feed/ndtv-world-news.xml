       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hezbollah forces on Friday resumed rocket and artillery attacks against Israel, ending the lull along the border following Israel's killing of the Lebanese group's military commander in Beirut.</p>

<p>Hezbollah said it had fired a surface-to-air missile at an Israeli warplane flying in Lebanese airspace overnight and forced it to turn back. Its forces also carried out two artillery attacks and two rocket strikes at military positions in northern Israel, it said.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said in a statement it had successfully intercepted an aerial target coming from Lebanon into the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights.</p>

<p>Israeli airstrikes and artillery fire hit several villages in southern Lebanon on Friday, according to Lebanese state media, a day after an Israeli strike killed at least five Syrian migrant workers in southern Lebanon, according to medics.</p>

<p>The Israeli military also said it had hit two Hezbollah fighters in southern Lebanon.</p>

<p>Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah said in an address on Thursday that he had ordered calm along the border following the Israeli airstrike in Beirut on Tuesday that killed military commander Fuad Shukr out of respect for the victims and to consider what the next steps should be.</p>

<p>The strike on the Hezbollah stronghold of Dahiyeh in Beirut's southern suburbs also killed an Iranian military adviser and five civilians.</p>

<p>Nasrallah said Hezbollah would retaliate but it would need to study what their response would be, and would otherwise resume its usual military operations against Israel.</p>

<p>Hezbollah and the Israeli military have been trading fire for nearly 10 months in parallel with the Gaza war, with exchanges mostly limited to the border area.</p>

<p>But strikes since last week have threatened to tip the conflict into a full-scale regional war.</p>

<p>Israel and the United States have accused Hezbollah of killing 12 youths in a July 27 rocket attack on the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, a claim Hezbollah has denied.</p>

<p>The United Nations peacekeeping force in Lebanon, known as UNIFIL, told Reuters on Friday it had not investigated the incident as the Israeli-occupied Golan is outside its mandated area of operations.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Israeli military confirmed on Thursday it had killed Al Jazeera journalist Ismail Al-Ghoul in an airstrike in Gaza, saying he was a Hamas operative who had taken part in the October 7 attack on Israel, without offering proof for the assertion.</p>

<p>Al Jazeera dismissed what it said were "baseless allegations" which it said were an attempt to justify the deliberate killing of its journalists.</p>

<p>"The network condemns the accusations against its correspondent Ismail Al-Ghoul, without providing any proof, documentation or video," it said in a statement, adding that it reserved the right to take legal action against those responsible.</p>

<p>The Qatari broadcaster said on Wednesday that Al-Ghoul and cameraman Ramy El Rify were killed in an Israeli strike on Gaza City while on an assignment to film near the house of Ismail Haniyeh, the Hamas chief killed in Iran earlier on the same day.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said Al-Ghoul was a member of the elite Nukhba unit who took part in the Oct. 7 attack and instructed Hamas operatives on how to record operations. It said he was involved in recording and publicizing attacks on Israeli troops.</p>

<p>"His activities in the field were a vital part of Hamas' military activity," the Israeli military said in a statement.</p>

<p>Al Jazeera said Al-Ghoul had worked for the network since November 2023 and his only profession was as a journalist.</p>

<p>It said he had been arrested and detained at Al-Shifa Hospital in the northern part of the Gaza Strip when it was taken by Israeli forces in March before being released, which it said "debunks and refutes their false claim of his affiliation with any organization."</p>

<p>The Israeli government has banned Al-Jazeera from operating in Israel, accusing it of posing a threat to national security.</p>

<p>Al Jazeera, which has been heavily critical of Israel's campaign in Gaza, has denied inciting violence.</p>

<p>The Hamas-run Gaza government media office said the deaths of the two Al Jazeera crew raised to 165 the number of Palestinian journalists killed by Israeli fire since Oct 7.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US Justice Department filed a lawsuit Friday against TikTok and parent company ByteDance for failing to protect children's privacy on the social media app.</p>

<p>The US government said TikTok violated the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act that requires services aimed at children to obtain parental consent to collect personal information from users under age 13.</p>

<p>The lawsuit is the latest US action against TikTok and its Chinese parent over fears the company improperly collects vast amounts of data on Americans for the Chinese government, while influencing content in a way that potentially harms Americans.</p>

<p>The suit, also joined by the Federal Trade Commission, said it was aimed at putting an end "to TikTok's unlawful massive-scale invasions of children's privacy."</p>

<p>The DOJ said TikTok knowingly permitted children to create regular TikTok accounts, and then create and share short-form videos and messages with adults and others on the regular TikTok platform. TikTok collected personal information from these children without obtaining consent from their parents.</p>

<p>The US alleges that for years millions of American children under 13 have been using TikTok and the site "has been collecting and retaining children's personal information."</p>

<p>"TikTok knowingly and repeatedly violated kids' privacy, threatening the safety of millions of children across the country," said FTC Chair Lina Khan, whose agency in June referred the case to the Justice Department.</p>

<p>The FTC is seeking penalties of up to $51,744 per violation per day from TikTok for improperly collecting data.</p>

<p>TikTok did not immediately comment but said in June it had been working with the FTC for more than a year to address the agency's concerns and said it was "disappointed the agency is pursuing litigation instead of continuing to work with us on a reasonable solution."</p>

<p>Reuters in 2020 first reported the FTC and Justice Department were looking into allegations the popular social media app failed to live up to a 2019 agreement aimed at protecting children's privacy.</p>

<p>The Chinese-owned short-video platform boasts around 170 million US users, and is currently fighting a new law that would force ByteDance to divest TikTok's US assets by January 19 or face a ban.</p>

<p>The company last year faced fines from the European Union and UK over its handling of children's data.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, US Senate passed a bill that would extend COPPA to cover teenagers up to age 17, ban targeted advertising to kids and teens, and give parents and kids the option to delete their information from social media platforms.</p>

<p>The bill would need to pass in the Republican-controlled House, currently on recess until September, to become law.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US Vice President Kamala Harris effectively secured the Democratic party's presidential nomination Friday, confirming her remarkable rise to party standard bearer in November's showdown against Republican Donald Trump.</p>

<p>Kamala Harris was the sole candidate on the ballot for a five-day electronic vote of nearly 4,000 party convention delegates. She will be officially crowned at a Chicago convention later this month.</p>

<p>"I am honored to be the presumptive Democratic nominee for President of the United States," Kamala Harris, 59, said on a phone-in to a party celebration after securing enough votes by the second day of the marathon vote.</p>

<p>In the two weeks since President Joe Biden ended his reelection bid, Kamala Harris has gained full control of the party.</p>

<p>No other Democrats stepped forward to challenge her elevation to the top of the ticket, making her confirmation as the first Black and South Asian woman ever to secure a major party's nomination a formality.</p>

<p>The announcement came with Kamala Harris preparing to hit the campaign trail next week for a swing across seven crucial battleground states with her newly minted running mate -- who is expected to be revealed within days.</p>

<p>The Democratic Party decided on a virtual nomination process -- mirroring the pandemic-hit 2020 vote -- because of Ohio's August 7 deadline for major parties to submit the names of their certified candidates for the November election.</p>

<p>The virtual roll call marks the official beginning of the 2024 convention, although in practice the festivities really get going when thousands of party faithful descend on Chicago on August 19.</p>

<p>That will feature ceremonial votes for Kamala Harris and her running mate in what is expected to be a raucous celebration of her rise from state politics to the top of the ticket.</p>

<p>Trump's White House bid was thrown into chaos on July 21 when Biden, 81, withdrew his candidacy, backing Kamala Harris as the Democratic nominee.</p>

<p>The vice president has already smashed fundraising records, packed arenas and wiped out Trump's polling leads over Biden, creating momentum that she hopes she can ride through the convention to the White House.</p>

<p>She is set to make her first public appearance with her running mate Tuesday in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania -- a crucial swing state whose Democratic governor, Josh Shapiro, is among a handful candidates being vetted to potentially join the Kamala Harris ticket.</p>

<p>The swing will take Kamala Harris through all the "blue wall" states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, where she will seek to rebuild the coalition that carried Biden to victory in 2020.</p>

<p>But she will extend the tour to the much more racially diverse Sun Belt and southern states of Georgia, North Carolina Arizona, North Carolina and Nevada as she seeks to shore up the Black and Hispanic vote that had been peeling away from the Democrats.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh was buried in Qatar on Friday after his killing in Tehran, an attack blamed on Israel that has heightened regional tensions as the Gaza war dragged on.</p>

<p>Haniyeh was laid to rest in Lusail, north of the capital Doha, following funeral prayers at the Gulf emirate's largest mosque attended by thousands of people.</p>

<p>Haniyeh, the Palestinian armed group's political chief, played a key role in mediated talks aimed at ending nearly 10 months of war between Hamas and Israel in the Gaza Strip.</p>

<p>The burial was restricted to a small number of people including one of Haniyeh's daughters, Sara, who shared a video on social media showing her pouring holy water over a pebble-topped grave before lowering her head to kiss it.</p>

<p>"In this moment, I buried my soul under the dirt and I departed. I departed with all the pain of the world in my ribs," she captioned the video uploaded on X.</p>

<p>Mourners earlier on Friday lined up inside Imam Muhammad bin Abdul Wahhab Mosque, where Haniyeh's casket, draped in a Palestinian flag, was briefly carried in to the shouts of angry mourners.</p>

<p>Others prayed on mats outside in temperatures that reached 44 degrees Celsius (111 degrees Fahrenheit).</p>

<p>"He was a symbol, a resistance leader... people are angry," said Taher Adel, 25, a Jordanian student residing in the Qatari capital.</p>

<p>Haniyeh's predecessor Khaled Meshaal spoke at the ceremony, saying he had "served his cause, his people... and never abandoned them".</p>

<p>Turkey and Pakistan announced a day of mourning on Friday to honour Haniyeh, while Hamas called for a "day of furious rage".</p>

<p>Many mourners in Doha wore scarves that combined the Palestinian flag with a checkered keffiyeh pattern and the message in English: "Free Palestine".</p>

<p><strong>High-profile killings</strong></p>

<p>Haniyeh and a bodyguard were killed in a pre-dawn "hit" on their accommodation in Tehran Wednesday, Iran's Revolutionary Guards said. Haniyeh was in Iran to attend the swearing-in of President Masoud Pezeshkian a day earlier.</p>

<p>Israel, accused by Hamas, Iran and others of the attack, has not directly commented on it.</p>

<p>The killing of Qatar-based Haniyeh is among several incidents since April that have sent regional tensions soaring during the Gaza war, which has drawn in Iran-backed armed groups in Syria, Lebanon, Iraq and Yemen.</p>

<p>Iranian officials met with representatives of these groups on Wednesday to discuss the next steps, either "a simultaneous response from Iran and its allies or a staggered response from each party", a source close to Lebanon's Hezbollah movement told AFP.</p>

<p>Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant met with his visiting British counterpart John Healey on Friday and stressed "the importance of establishing a coalition" to support "Israel's defence against Iran and its proxies", Gallant's office said.</p>

<p>Military chief Herzi Halevi told troops Israel would respond "very strongly" to any attacks, an army statement said.</p>

<p>France urged its nationals visiting Iran to leave "due to the increased risk of a military escalation".</p>

<p>During the Gaza war, Hezbollah and Israeli forces have engaged in near-daily exchanges of fire, and did so again on Friday.</p>

<p>In Gaza, the civil defence agency reported several people killed in the territory's north, and Israel's military said it had killed around 30 operatives near Rafah, in the south.</p>

<p>Haniyeh's assassination came hours after Israel struck a southern suburb of Beirut, killing Fuad Shukr, the military commander of Lebanese Hamas ally Hezbollah.</p>

<p>Haniyeh's deputy, Saleh al-Aruri, was killed in Beirut early this year.</p>

<p>On Thursday Israel confirmed the death of Hamas military chief Mohammed Deif in a July strike in Gaza.</p>

<p><strong>Deal 'off the table'</strong></p>

<p>Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas in retaliation for its October 7 attack that ignited the war in Gaza.</p>

<p>The attack on southern Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,197 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.</p>

<p>Hamas operatives also seized 251 hostages, 111 of whom are still held captive in Gaza, including 39 the military says are dead.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory campaign against Hamas has killed at least 39,480 people in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry, which does not give details of civilian and militant deaths.</p>

<p>The fighting has sparked a dire humanitarian crisis in the besieged territory. On Friday, the UN Satellite Centre said nearly two-thirds of the buildings in Gaza, or 151,265 structures, have been damaged or destroyed during the war.</p>

<p>On Thursday, Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei led prayers for Haniyeh in Tehran, having earlier threatened "harsh punishment" for his killing.</p>

<p>The New York Times, citing Middle Eastern officials, has reported that Haniyeh was killed by an explosive device planted weeks ago at a Tehran guesthouse.</p>

<p>Asked about the report, Israeli military spokesman Daniel Hagari told journalists "there was no other Israeli aerial attack... in all the Middle East" on the night of Shukr's killing in Lebanon.</p>

<p>Israel said Shukr's assassination -- for which Hezbollah said retaliation was "inevitable" -- was a response to rocket fire which killed 12 youths last week in the annexed Golan Heights.</p>

<p>Iranian news agency Fars said the US report was a "lie", insisting that the Hamas leader was killed by a "projectile".</p>

<p>Analyst Hugh Lovatt said Haniyeh's killing "will mean that a ceasefire deal with Israel is now totally off of the table".</p>

<p>The White House said US President Joe Biden spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday and affirmed his commitment to defend Israel's security "against all threats from Iran".</p>

<p>"We have the basis for a ceasefire (in Gaza)... They should move on it now," Biden told reporters after the call.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When eight Russian citizens including a convicted hitman touched down in Moscow on Thursday in a historic prisoner swap with the West, President Vladimir Putin greeted them like heroes.</p>

<p>"I want to congratulate you all on your return to your Motherland," Putin beamed, assuring the group that also included cybercriminals and spies that Russia had not forgotten them for "even a minute".</p>

<p>Putin's message -- both to those released on Thursday and his agents across the world -- was clear: Even if you get caught, the Kremlin has your back.</p>

<p>A total of 24 people were freed in Thursday's exchange -- 16 headed to the West and eight to Russia -- in the biggest prisoner swap deal since the Cold War.</p>

<p>Russia released US journalists Evan Gershkovich and Alsu Kurmasheva, ex-marine Paul Whelan as well as high-profile domestic dissidents.</p>

<p>In return, it secured the largest number of alleged Russian spies freed in a single exchange for over a decade, as well as FSB security service assassin Vadim Krasikov.</p>

<p>"For the target audience, Putin brought back his soldiers, the heroes of a hybrid Third World War," said Russian political analyst Konstantin Kalachev.</p>

<p>"And the audience is not just special services, but millions who feel like citizens of a country at war with a stronger enemy," he added.</p>

<p>Among those returning to Russia were two sleeper agents living on false documents in Slovenia, a prolific hacker and an alleged Russian colonel posing as a Brazilian researcher in Norway.</p>

<p>For Putin, the main prize was Krasikov -- an elite FSB officer arrested in Germany in 2019 for murdering a former Chechen separatist on what Berlin said was Moscow's orders.</p>

<p>Putin, previously director of the FSB and an officer in its Soviet incarnation the KGB, had long pushed for Krasikov to be included in a prisoner swap deal, an idea that Germany had resisted.</p>

<p>The deal will have "strengthened loyalty" among other spies and assassins, said Abbas Gallyamov, an independent political analyst and former Kremlin speechwriter.</p>

<p>"Putin can count on them to work with greater dedication," he added.</p>

<p><strong>'Win-win'</strong></p>

<p>For the West, the exchange has raised fears Putin could become even more emboldened to take prisoners in what it blasts as "hostage diplomacy".</p>

<p>The Kremlin said Friday it was determined to see the release of more Russians it believes are wrongfully imprisoned in the West.</p>

<p>Over the last two years, Russia had been "blatantly" detaining Westerners for a possible swap "as negotiations with the West stalled" amid the Ukraine offensive, said Tatiana Stanovaya, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center.</p>

<p>Russia and the West have a long history of swaps, including in 2022 when US basketball star Brittney Griner was exchanged with Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout.</p>

<p>But with Thursday's deal involving not just foreigners but Russian dissidents, Moscow reminded "the whole world of its repression, lawlessness and cruelty against critics of the authorities," Stanovaya said in an article.</p>

<p>Before the 2022 agreements to free first US Marine Trevor Reed and then Griner, deals had usually involved swapping spies for spies.</p>

<p>Moscow has tried to present this deal in similar terms.</p>

<p>Gershkovich and Whelan were both convicted of "espionage" -- charges rejected as baseless by the White House -- and the FSB said on Thursday that the Russians it released had "acted in the interests of foreign states to the detriment of Russia's security."</p>

<p>But to the West, the arrest of Gershkovich in particular -- the first "espionage" charges levelled at a US reporter in Russia since the cold War -- showed the Kremlin was willing to cross red lines.</p>

<p>Russia may see the exchange as a great success and "wonderful victory", political analyst Ekaterina Schulmann said in an interview with Russia's independent TV Rain.</p>

<p>But the reality was more nuanced.</p>

<p>"Russia is getting eight clumsy losers who couldn't do their job and got caught," she said.</p>

<p>"While it is giving away people who, if they want to and if they are able, will become significant political public figures."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Biden administration is convinced that Iran will attack Israel in the coming days and is preparing to help it repel it , three American sources told Axios, according to which the Iranian attack - in retaliation for the killing of Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran - could follow the same pattern as the one conducted on April 13, but potentially larger, could involve the Lebanese Hezbollah.</p>

<p>But the administration fears that, unlike four months ago, it may be more difficult to mobilise the same regional and international coalition that helped Israel defend itself from the swarm of drones and missiles launched in April, reports Adnkronos news agency.</p>

<p>The killing of Ismail Haniyeh "does not help" efforts to reach a ceasefire in Gaza with Hamas, US President Joe Biden admitted, speaking to reporters at the Andrews air base where he went to welcome prisoners exchanged with Russia.</p>

<p>Biden - who yesterday had a telephone conversation with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu - said he was "very concerned" about the latest escalation of tensions in the Middle East.</p>

<p>"We have a ceasefire base, it has to go forward and they have to go forward," the president urged again, in a reference to the phone call with Netanyahu, which he called "very direct."</p>

<p>Ismail Haniyeh will be buried in Qatar today. The body of the Hamas political leader arrived in Doha yesterday from Iran, after thousands of people attended his funeral in Tehran.</p>

<p>According to Hamas and Qatari state media, the funeral prayer will be held after the Friday prayer at Qatar's national mosque, followed by burial in the city of Lusail.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

</div>

<p>While <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/who-was-ismail-haniyeh-hamas-leader-killed-in-iran-6228475">Hamas Politburo chief Ismail Haniyeh's</a> assassination in <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/hamas-chief-ismail-haniyeh-killed-in-irans-capital-report-6228024">Iran's capital Tehran</a> mere hours after the swearing-in ceremony of President Masoud Pezeshkian has created shockwaves across the world, the response to the killing is expected to be imminent, and, possibly, tectonic.</p>

<p>Haniyeh was, after all, the political chief of a group labelled a terror entity by the US and many others. In fact, some had designated the group so long before they listed Al Qaeda in the same bracket. The likes of Al Qaeda saw a more rapid ascent in using violence globally, culminating with the 9/11 terror attacks in the US, which also launched a two-decade-long 'war on terror'. The likes of Hamas, on the other hand, confined themselves around the issue of both the sovereignty of Palestine and a fundamental ideological aversion to the state of Israel.</p>

<h2><strong>'Axis of Resistance' At Iranian President's Swearing-In Ceremony</strong></h2>

<p>The killing of Haniyeh is shocking but not unexpected. In November 2023, a month after Hamas orchestrated the terror attack against Israel - from which the group continues to hold hostages - the Israeli establishment had made it clear that it would go after the leadership of the likes of Hamas in Gaza, the Hezbollah in Lebanon, and others. Back then, the Yemen-based Ansrallah (more popularly known as the Houthis) was not as big an actor as it has today become, specifically in the Red Sea theatre. At Pezeshkian's swearing-in, the leadership of all these groups, known more formally as the 'Axis of Resistance', were in attendance.</p>

<p><strong><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/watch-what-hamas-chief-ismail-haniyeh-was-doing-hours-before-his-assasination-6231404">Watch | What Hamas Chief Ismail Haniyeh Did Hours Before His Assassination</a></strong></p>

<p>The fact that Haniyeh was killed in the middle of Tehran at a time when it was teeming with military personnel sends out a strong message of both access to and the compromise of Iranian security and polity infrastructure. This further underscored the fact that a narrative was built to showcase where groups like Hamas gain their strength from (although this has not been an area of question or contention). While Israel has not taken responsibility for the attack, Iran blames the Jewish state for the same. However, Israel has, in the meantime, taken responsibility for the killing of top Hezbollah commander Fouad Shukur in a strike on the Lebanese capital of Beirut, and the elimination of Hamas military commander Mohammed Deif in Gaza, known to be a key architect of the October 7 terror strike.</p>

<h2><strong>What Next?</strong></h2>

<p>The big question at this juncture is, what next? In April, Iran retaliated against Israel after the latter targeted what Tehran claimed was part of its diplomatic mission in Damascus, Syria. This event set forth an escalation ladder where Iran could not be seen as being unable or incapable of directly responding militarily and not just via its knitting of proxy groups spread across the region. While Tehran for long has sought to create a level of strategic ambiguity, where attacks by proxy groups that receive material and political support from the country's all-powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and its elite clandestine foreign wing, the Quds Force, gave it a level of deniability, Haniyeh's assassination may in part be designed to reverse this blueprint and pull Iran out of its own shadows, into a more direct, visible, and public confrontation.</p>

<p><strong><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/irans-supreme-leader-ayatollah-ali-khamenei-orders-attack-on-israel-for-hamas-chief-ismail-haniyeh-killing-report-6235614">Also Read |&nbsp;Iran's Leader Orders Attack On Israel After Hamas Chief's Killing: Report</a></strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Even if Iran would for the moment want to hold back, the rhetoric and expectation from its Axis partners may not allow it to do so. If by way of argument, Israel is goading a response from Tehran, a speech given by Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah on Thursday found itself in the same space as Israel, looking for an active response from the Iranian side. "Do those people think they can kill a commander like Ismail Haniyeh and Iran will remain silent?" Nasrallah said as he laid out a requirement for avenging Haniyeh's death. For long, the Iran-backed Axis has fought for its own ideological and political aims that feed into a larger construct, in way of providing manpower and geography alike. During this, they have also absorbed tremendous loss. This is especially true for the Hamas in Gaza. It may become hard for Iran now to exercise strategic restraint, even though the likes of Hezbollah may well do so themselves in the long term, despite the rhetoric.</p>

<h2><strong>Some Forced To Find A Middle Path</strong></h2>

<p>For others in the region, specifically in the Arab Gulf, the current trajectory of escalation remains worrying. Many top Arab representatives, including from the UAE, Bahrain, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and other countries, were present at Pezeshkian's inauguration. The likes of Saudi Arabia and the UAE in the recent past have increased their engagement with Iran in a bid to course-correct the long-standing narrative of Shia-Sunni confrontations. While sectarian issues remain mostly entrenched, geopolitical and geoeconomic realities have forced those like Saudi Arabia, for example, to find a middle path with the Houthis in Yemen via dialogue, a group with which they technically have been at war since 2015.</p>

<p>For Riyadh, Abu Dhabi, and so on, reconstructing this crisis first as one between Israel and Iran, and then, as a longer and larger battle for Palestinian self-determination, may well be crucial to secure their own neutrality.</p>

<h2><strong>Region Remains Sensitive</strong></h2>

<p>The US, a core security player in the region, has been relatively silent since Haniyeh's death. US President Joe Biden has said that Haniyeh's killing will not help the ceasefire and a negotiated deal with Hamas over the release of Israeli hostages. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, himself facing severe political headwinds, seems to have chosen the popular demand to eliminate figureheads such as Haniyeh at a time when, even if a deal was brokered, he would have had to release in exchange hundreds of Hamas members who are currently being held in Israeli prisons.</p>

<p>Finally, regional tensions are expected to remain significantly high in the days to come as Iran and its proxies decide upon a response. In April, there were hints that the escalation between Iran and Israel was at some level mitigated and managed, perhaps via indirect communication or some kind of mediation. This time, the region may well not be so lucky unless a regional and global effort to calm the situation down is mobilised immediately.</p>

</div>

<p>US Vice-Presidential candidate J.D. Vance's 2021 comment about "childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they've made'' has set the cat among the pigeons. Well, not so much among pigeons, but certainly among a lot of women who have come out breathing fire that he dared to make such a disparaging remark about women who do not have children. They have slammed his misogyny, his contempt for the choices that women make, and his portrayal of women without children as joyless creatures who try to fill their empty lives with their cats. (Clearly, Vance thinks that a mewling cat fits his vision of a pathetic childless woman much better than a barking dog).</p>

<p>Vance's remark was, of course, a political one, meant to belittle women leaders in the liberal Democratic fold - women like Vice-President Kamala Harris, for instance - who do not have biological children. Nevertheless, there's no doubt that it sprang from his deeply held belief that there is something lacking in women who are childless. That they are incomplete, incompetent, socially detached, and, hence, unworthy of respect.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Only Contempt, Pity For Childless Women</strong></h2>

<p>Sounds familiar? Of course, it does! We Indian women are all too acquainted with this belief system. So much so that we could be forgiven for wondering what the caterwaul over Vance's comment is all about. Heck, the guy merely verbalised his belief as offensively as he could, but isn't this hostility exactly what childless women in our society are subjected to? Which makes one wonder if Vance's sterling opinion about childless women was also bolstered by his Indian wife Usha, who is a serious procreator and has produced three children.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But let us not speculate. Let us stick to facts. And the fact is that every Indian woman who has not had a child - whether by choice or for medical issues or for any other reason, whether she is affluent or underprivileged, stays in an urban high-rise or a rural hovel - is treated with contempt, pity and, in some cases, murderous cruelty. (We are talking about married women here, because, <em>chhi chhi</em>, no one expects unmarried women to have children. Besides, single women face another level of derision altogether).</p>

<h2><strong>'Born A Woman, Suffer Like One'</strong></h2>

<p>Sure, child-bearing is a perfectly natural life choice. But for some weird reason, not having a child is considered monstrously unnatural. Try telling your officious aunt or over-friendly female neighbour that you have seen the misery and exhaustion of your friends who were new mothers, their eyes hollowed from sleeplessness; you've seen them give up their careers for their children, or be torn with guilt because they have gone back to their jobs. And, no, thank you, that life is not for you - you'd rather be childfree and carefree. Said aunt and neighbour will be horrified by your perversity, your unfeminine rejection of the reproductive instinct. You were born a woman, dammit, you should jolly well go through the pain of being one!</p>

<p>If you want to shock them some more, you could say that you prefer to spend the money that you earn on yourself, go on holidays, and be able to afford a better lifestyle than you could if you had a child. After this brazen expression of sinful self-centredness, they will probably shun you altogether.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As a childfree woman, I can tell you that should you wish to not have a baby, your reproductive years will be signposted thus: First, gentle questions from female relatives about when you will give them the "good news''. Second, less gentle questions about why the "good news'' is not forthcoming. Third, reassurances that you still have plenty of time to become a mother - and why not check out this fertility doctor, in case, you know, that is the problem. And finally, the stage when friends and relatives realise that you really have no intention of reproducing and, improbable as it may be, are happy with the choice you have made.</p>

<h2><strong>If Anything, Childless Women Should Get Tax Breaks</strong></h2>

<p>But wait, remaining child-free does not mean that you will be free from pitying looks and insinuations that you are a luckless woman who failed to achieve the true fulfilment of your womanhood by not producing a baby. Depending on your social, cultural and economic milieu, the reactions could range from being dismissed as a <em>baanjh </em>(barren woman), to melting commiseration over your so-called misfortune, to glowering resentment if you were so bold as to declare that you are not sorry that you are childless, that you enjoy your unencumbered status and thank your lucky stars that you don't have to spend an arm and a leg on sending your child (or children) abroad to study, nor leave them to a world lurching towards a climate catastrophe.</p>

<p>With birth rates going down drastically in the West (the share of US adults under 50 who do not have children and are unlikely to ever have children rose from 37% in 2018 to 47% in 2023), one could argue that some folks there have reason to be worried about more and more women not going down the path of procreation. But no such problem exists in India. True, here, too, overall fertility rates are on the decline, but we are still a very long way from making a dent in our population burden and reaching a point when, say, 2 crore people do not apply for 60,000 railway jobs. Really, what women without children in this country ought to get is not hostility, but tax breaks for not adding to the population swell!</p>

<p>But fat chance of that happening - even if the current finance minister is replaced by another. Still, people like Vance in this country will have to get used to the idea that as women attain greater levels of education and financial independence, many more will choose not to have babies. Yes, it's fun to blame women for everything they do or not do, but we are fast reaching a stage when we don't give a damn. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, hold my uterus - I'm off to a pet shop to get myself a cat.&nbsp;</p>

       <description><![CDATA[The decision to strike follows months of negotiations with major videogame companies including Activision Productions, Electronic Arts, Epic Games, Take-Two Interactive, Disney Character Voices and Warner Bros Discovery's WB Games.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Striking video game voice actors and motion-capture performers held their first picket on Thursday in front of Warner Bros. Games and said artificial intelligence was a threat to their professions.</p>

<p>"The models that they're using have been trained on our voices without our consent at all, with no compensation," "Persona 5 Tactica" voice actor and video game strike captain, Leeanna Albanese, told Reuters on the picket line.</p>

<p>Video game voice actors and motion-capture performers called a strike last week over failed labor contract negotiations focused on AI-related protections for workers.</p>

<p>This marks the latest strike in Hollywood after union writers and actors marched on the picket lines last year with AI also being a major concern.</p>

<p>"I think when you remove the human element from any interactive project, whether it be a video game or TV show, an animated series, a movie, and you put AI in replacement for the human element, we can tell! I'm a gamer, I'm a digester of this content," British "Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare &amp; Warzone" actor Jeff Leach said.</p>

<p>The decision to strike follows months of negotiations with major videogame companies including Activision Productions, Electronic Arts, Epic Games, Take-Two Interactive, Disney Character Voices and Warner Bros Discovery's WB Games.</p>

<p>However, major video game publishers including Electronic Arts and Take-Two will likely stave off a big hit from the strike due to their in-house studios and the lengthy development cycles for games, analysts have said.</p>

<p>The strike also brings with it a larger call to action across Hollywood as people in the industry advocate for a law that can protect them from AI risks as well.</p>

<p>"There's not a larger national law to protect us, so the NO FAKES Act is basically legislation with the goal of protecting our identities, protecting our personhood on a national scale as opposed to on a state level," Albanese said.</p>

<p>The NO FAKES Act, a bipartisan bill in Congress which would make it illegal to make an AI replica of someone's likeness and voice without their permission, has gained support from the SAG-AFTRA performers union, the Motion Picture Association, The Recording Academy and Disney.</p>

<p>From Grammy-winning artist Taylor Swift to Vice President Kamala Harris, who is running in the 2024 presidential election, leaders in entertainment and beyond say deep fakes created from AI are a pressing policy matter.</p>

<p>"Everybody in this country needs protection from the abusive use of AI," Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, the national executive director and chief negotiator of SAG-AFTRA told Reuters at the picket line.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<ol>
	<li>Lin Yu-ting, the three-time world championships medallist, will kick off her <a href="https://sports.ndtv.com/olympics-2024/indias-schedule-paris-olympics-august-02-manu-bhaker-begins-campaign-for-3rd-medal-lakshya-sen-in-quarter-final-6241750">Paris Olympics </a>campaign today against Sitora Turdibekova of Uzbekistan in the 57-kilogram category. Lin Yu-ting made her debut at the amateur championship level in the Asian Championships, held in Vietnam in 2017. Lin started boxing at middle school in Taipei back in 2008.</li>
	<li>At the age of 21, Lin Yu-ting bagged a gold medal at the Asian Championships, held in Ho Chi Minh City in 2017. She beat Vietnam's Le Thi Bang in the bantamweight division to earn the prized medal.</li>
	<li>A year later, Lin Yu-ting secured a bantamweight <a href="https://sports.ndtv.com/olympics-2024/paris-olympic-games-2024-day-6-live-20km-race-walk-final-hockey-and-lakshya-vs-prannoy-6236701">gold medal</a>. She has also been a gold medalist at the 2019 Asian Championships, the 2022 Asian Games and the 2022 World Championships. She is a two-time Asian Games medallist (featherweight gold 2023, flyweight bronze 2018) as well. Victory at the Asian Games ensured her participation in the Paris Olympics. She entered the Paris Olympics as the top-seeded boxer in the women's 57kg featherweight category. This earned her a first-round bye ahead of the bout against Sitora Turdibekova.</li>
	<li>Lin Yu-ting currently holds the third rank in the Elite Women 54-kg feather global standings. The 28-year-old made her Olympic debut at Tokyo 2020. At the Tokyo games, she conceded a defeat at the hands of Filipino amateur <a href="https://sports.ndtv.com/olympics-2024/who-is-imane-khalif-the-algerian-boxer-at-center-of-gender-controversy-in-paris-olympics-6244664">boxer </a>Nesthy Petecio in the featherweight round of 16.</li>
	<li>In 2023, Lin Yu‑ting and Imane Khelif were disqualified from the 2023 women's world championships having failed an unspecified gender eligibility test. The governing body decided to strip Lin of a bronze medal last year because it claimed that the boxer had failed to meet certain unspecified eligibility requirements in a biochemical test.</li>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Algerian boxer <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/imane-khelif-angela-carini-olympics-paris-2024-shocking-unfair-outrage-after-algeria-boxers-olympics-win-over-italian-6245673">Imane Khelif's </a>Olympic bout against Angela Carini ended in just 46 seconds after the Italian fighter withdrew from the match. She was seen sobbing in the middle of the ring. However, the match result led to massive outrage on social media, a debate about Khelif's gender and whether or not she should have been allowed to compete in the women's category. Khelif, a biological woman, has lost on several occasions, including at the Tokyo Olympics<br />
<br />
It has also led to many asking what gender testing exactly is. The procedure of identifying whether a person is male or female is known as gender testing. It is often implemented to find out the sex of your unborn kid. In the sports circuit, gender tests are employed to ascertain an athlete's sex because there have been instances of men competing as women and getting undue advantage from it.</p>

<p><strong>How Does Gender Testing Work</strong></p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/pregnancy/blood-test-for-gender#other-methods">Healthline</a>, gender tests are evaluated by specialists in internal medicine, gynaecology, endocrinology, and psychology. The ones opting for gender verification undergo blood tests that determine their chromosomes, sex hormones, and genes. If the results obtained from the blood sample show that the person has the Y chromosome, it indicates that they are a male. If the Y chromosome is absent, it reveals that the person is a female.</p>

<p>A somewhat less invasive test is known as cell-free DNA screening, in which a patient provides a blood sample at a local lab or the doctor's office, according to Healthline. There are home DNA kits available as well. These tests function similarly to lab tests, with the only exception being that they search for male chromosomes rather than screening the person's blood.<br />
<br />
<strong>History Of Gender Testing</strong><br />
<br />
According to <a href="https://www.topendsports.com/testing/tests/gender-test.htm#:~:text=Gender%20testing%20is%20the%20process,the%20sex%20of%20your%20child.">Topend Sports</a>, the International Amateur Athletic Federation (IAAF) launched the very first gender verification testing in sports in 1996. Concerns that men with a physical advantage in strength and muscle mass were cheating by masquerading as women in female-oriented competitions led to the implementation of gender testing. Although the IAAF abandoned it in 1991, women athletes were tested at the Olympic Games at Albertville and Barcelona using polymerase chain reaction (PCR).&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Turkey on Friday blocked access to the Instagram social media network, the national communications authority said without explanation, following censorship accusations against the US company by a high-ranking Turkish official.</p>

<p>The BTK communications authority said in a post on its website that "instagram.com has been blocked by a decision on the date of 02/08/2024", without adding further details.</p>

<p>Many users living in Turkey complained on the X platform that they could not refresh their Instagram feed, an issue verified by AFP journalists.</p>

<p>The Turkish presidency's communications director Fahrettin Altun on Wednesday hit out at Meta-owned Instagram, accusing the platform of "impeding people from publishing messages of condolence for the martyr Haniyeh".</p>

<p>Ismail Haniyeh, the political chief of the armed Palestinian Islamist group Hamas and a close ally of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, was killed in Tehran on Wednesday in an attack blamed on Israel.</p>

<p>"This is a very clear and obvious attempt at censure," Altun said on X.</p>

<p>According to Turkish media, there are more than 50 million users signed up to Instagram in Turkey, out of a population of 85 million.</p>

<p>The decision sparked mockery on other social media networks such as X.</p>

<p>A meme showing a congested metro station with the tagline: "X when Turks wake up to find that Instagram is blocked", began trending on the platform.</p>

<p>"Instagram is blocked in Turkey, life is over", wrote user "CringeOfMaster" alongside a picture of a grieving man.</p>

<p>Others mockingly asked Instagram users where they could see their doctored images now.</p>

<p>This is not the first time that Turkish authorities have blocked access to social media sites.</p>

<p>Wikipedia was blocked between April 2017 and January 2020 over two articles that alleged a link between the presidency and extremism.</p>

<p>That caused shock in a country where Erdogan's government is often accused of attacking civil freedoms due to the amount of online information that became inaccessible.</p>

<p>In April, Facebook owner Meta suspended its Threads social network in Turkey following a decision by authorities there to prevent it from sharing information with Instagram.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-08/cnm4v45o_prisoner-swap_625x300_02_August_24.jpg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>In a high-profile prisoner swap that is being hailed by Biden supporters as a major victory for the administration, Russia released <em>Wall Street Journal</em> reporter Evan Gershkovich and former US marine Paul Whelan, along with 14 others.</p>

<p>In a press statement, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said, "Under President Biden's leadership, we have secured the release of dozens of Americans who were held hostage or wrongfully detained." This set the tone for a political show of strength by the Democrats in the upcoming days as the party prepares for its big event in Chicago, the Democratic National Convention on August 19, where President Biden will be making his baton-handing speech.</p>

<h2><strong>A Win To Show</strong></h2>

<p>The prisoner swap provides him with the perfect opportunity to show that his administration got work done while the Republican nominee Donald Trump made false claims. What gives Biden a shot in the arm is that Trump had claimed that Russian President Vladimir Putin would release Evan Gershkovich for him but not for anyone else (by which he meant President Biden, who was still running for a second term in May when Trump made this claim). He has been proven wrong in less than three months.</p>

<p>Social media was abuzz with celebratory notes around the release of Gershkovich, and it was Eric Columbus, litigator for Speaker Nancy Pelosi, whose X post drew attention to the comparison between Biden and Trump when he said, "Trump loses his hostage as Evan Gershkovich is released."</p>

<h2><strong>Trump's Response</strong></h2>

<p>However, Trump remained at his combative best, asking why details of the prisoner swap were not shared yet. He wrote on Truth Social - "How many people do we get versus them? Are we also paying them cash? Are they giving us cash (Please withdraw that question, because I'm sure the answer is NO)? Are we releasing murderers, killers, or thugs? Just curious because we never make good deals, at anything, but especially hostage swaps. "</p>

<p>Trump also claimed that he got back many hostages and gave the other country "NOTHING - and never any cash". He also played on the point that releasing, what may be called prisoners convicted of serious crimes, would set a "bad precedent for the future".</p>

<p>Among those released as part of the deal by the Western governments - US, Germany, Poland, Norway, and Slovenia - is convicted murderer Vadim Krasikov from a German prison. Krasikov was convicted for killing a Georgian asylum seeker who fought in Chechnya against the Russians. He was killed just meters away from the office of the then-German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, in Berlin in 2019. Germany has called the announcement to allow the swap for Krasikov "not an easy decision".</p>

<h2><strong>Biden's 'Man Of Action' Moment</strong></h2>

<p>Some US media quoted senior administration officials to say that German Chancellor Olaf Scholtz had told President Biden in February in the White House that he would agree to the difficult swap only for Biden. In his announcement after the swap was publicly announced, Biden thanked the allies including Turkey, which played a vital role in facilitating the release. He said, "This would not have been possible without our allies... Today is a powerful example of why it's vital to have friends in this world."</p>

<p>The biggest prisoner swap since the Cold War with Russia would also help Biden leave office asserting his diplomatic prowess, that he is a man who had the skill to be able to bring together American allies and partners in tough times. The Democrats would hope that for Biden, who is under the scanner for his stand in the ongoing Israel-Palestine conflict and the botched-up Afghan withdrawal, the prisoner swap that is being termed "historic" by the US media would turn the attention to the bigger American issue around Russia. And even as Biden bows out of the race making way for Harris, his diplomatic legacy would not end up being a baggage too heavy for Harris to carry into November.&nbsp;</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli air strikes that killed international aid workers in Gaza in April were the result of serious operational failures but were not intentional, according to an Australian government review of the incident released on Friday.</p>

<p>Three Israeli air strikes hit the convoy of aid vehicles travelling through Gaza on April 1, killing seven World Central Kitchen (WCK) staff, including Australian team leader Zomi Frankcom. Palestinians and citizens of the United States, Britain and Poland were also among those killed.</p>

<p>The killings drew widespread condemnation from Israel's allies as well as accusations by some that Israel had deliberately targeted the aid workers, a claim it rejected.</p>

<p>An Australian review into the deaths said the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) decided to launch missiles at the convoy after mistakenly believing it was being hijacked by Hamas fighters, who were in fact locally contracted security guards.</p>

<p>In addition, information about the WCK convoy's movements had not reached the IDF team behind the strike, it said. This confusion was compounded because Israeli officials could not directly communicate with the aid convoy, the review added.</p>

<p>IDF staff also violated standard procedures in ordering the second and third strikes on the convoy without carrying out another identification process, it said.</p>

<p>"In this incident, it appears that the IDF controls failed, leading to errors in decision making and a misidentification, likely compounded by a level of confirmation bias," according to Air Chief Marshal Mark Binskin, who travelled to Israel to investigate the deaths.</p>

<p>"Based on the information available to me, it is my assessment that the IDF strike on the WCK aid workers was not knowingly or deliberately directed against the WCK."</p>

<p>Israel's investigation into the deaths had been "timely, appropriate and, with some exceptions, sufficient," he said.</p>

<p>Binskin said an apology and compensation for the families were important considerations for Israel but stopped short of recommending Australia demand either of Israel.</p>

<p>The IDF has apologised and dismissed two senior commanders involved in the strikes. Three other commanders were formally reprimanded. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the strikes were unintended and tragic.</p>

<p>Foreign Minister Penny Wong said Australia wanted those accountable to be held responsible, including criminal charges if appropriate.</p>

<p>Wong said she had written to her Israeli counterpart calling for greater protection for humanitarian workers.</p>

<p>"This is not an isolated incident," she said. "We have seen 250 aid workers killed during this conflict and we have also seen recent events where UN vehicles have been fired upon and it is clear that more needs to be done."</p>

<p>The family of the killed aid worker Frankcom called the Australian review an important first step and said they hoped Israel would conduct further investigations followed by appropriate action.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Harry Potter creator JK Rowling has courted controversy after she referred to Algerian boxer Imane Khelif as a man. Ms Rowling's comment came after Khelif defeated Italian boxer Angela Carini at the ongoing Paris Olympics 2024.<br />
<br />
The Carini-Khelif fight lasted 46 seconds after the Italian boxer decided to abandon the bout to "preserve her life". Soon after, she fell to her knees sobbing and even refused to shake hands with Khelif. The Algerian boxer was announced as the winner.<br />
<br />
"I am heartbroken... I went to the ring to honour my father. I was told a lot of times that I was a warrior but I preferred to stop for my health. I have never felt a punch like this," Carini said.</p>

<p>Reacting to Carini's defeat, Ms Rowling posted on X, "Watch this (whole thread), then explain why you're OK with a man beating a woman in public for your entertainment. This isn't sport. From the bullying cheat in red all the way up to the organisers who allowed this to happen, this is men revelling in their power over women."<br />
<br />
She also shared a video clip of the fight.</p>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p><br />
Next, she shared a post by Kirsty Burrows, Head of the Safe Sport Unit at the International Olympic Committee (IOC), slamming them for allowing "a male to get in the ring with her (Carini)."&nbsp;</p>

<p>"You're a disgrace, your ‘safeguarding' is a joke and #Paris24 will be forever tarnished by the brutal injustice done to Carini," she added.</p>

<p>In another post, Rowling shared a photograph of Carini crying and Khelif looking at her. "Could any picture sum up our new men's rights movement better? The smirk of a male who's knows he's protected by a misogynist sporting establishment enjoying the distress of a woman he's just punched in the head, and whose life's ambition he's just shattered."<br />
<br />
However, Rowling's post has been criticised by many stating that Khelif was raised and identified as a female, and she is not a transgender. A user also pointed out that Algeria was a "Fundamentalist country where homosexuality and sex change are illegal and she had to go past the obstacles of her father's disapproval to be able to do Boxing."&nbsp;</p>

<p><br />
As per the rules, athletes with Differences in Sex Development (DSD) are currently eligible to compete in women's competition at the Olympics.<br />
<br />
<strong>What is DSD?</strong><br />
<br />
These are a group of rare conditions that involve genes, hormones and reproductive organs. Some of the people with DSDs are raised as female, however, they have XY sex chromosomes, while their blood testosterone levels are in the male range.</p>

<p>Last year, Algeria's Khelif was disqualified hours before her gold-medal bout in the world championships in New Delhi as she fell foul of International Boxing Association (IBA) eligibility rules, which do not allow athletes with XY chromosomes to compete in women's events.</p>

<p>Why she's been allowed to compete at the Paris Olympics 2024</p>

<p>In June last year, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) stripped the International Boxing Association (IBA) of its status as the global governing body for boxing as it failed to complete reforms on governance, finance and ethical issues, Reuters reported.</p>

<p>As a result, IOC is now running the boxing competition at the Paris Games and its rules on inclusion of the athletes with DSDs as well as gender diversity in the women's competition apply.<br />
<br />
<strong>Who is Imane Khelif?</strong><br />
<br />
The 25-year-old hails from the Tiaret city of Algeria and is also the UNICEF ambassador at present. While her father did not "approve of boxing for girls," she decided to inspire the next generation by winning a gold medal on grand stages.</p>

<p>She made her debut as a professional in the 2018 World Championships and finished 17th. During the 2019 edition of the event, she came in 19th position. In the Tokyo Olympics in 2021, she was knocked out by Ireland's Kellie Harrington in the quarter-finals.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Amid social media outrage over her eligibility, the IOC defended Khelif and said, "All athletes participating in the boxing tournament of the Olympic Games Paris 2024 comply with the competition's eligibility and entry regulations, as well as all applicable medical regulations set by the Paris 2024 Boxing Unit (PBU). As with previous Olympic boxing competitions, the gender and age of the athletes are based on their passports."</p>

<p>Khelif is competing in the women's category in the 66kg division.</p>

Another social media user pointed out that Imane Khelif was a female-born woman fighter, perfectly eligible to compete in women's sports from a gender point of view. "She's born a female, please do not belittle her achievement as a woman and call her a man. It's not right. This mass misinformation needs to stop," the post read.</p>

Imane Khelif is an amateur boxer who clinched a silver medal at the International Boxing Association's 2022 World Championships. Khelif is one of the two boxers permitted to fight at the Olympics despite being disqualified from the women's world championships last year for allegedly failing gender eligibility tests.<br />
<br />
According to the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/olympics-2024-boxing-gender-4b6eb881cce9c34484d30c68ad979127">Associated Press</a>, the International Boxing Association disqualified Imane from last year's championships right before the Algerian's gold-medal bout because of elevated levels of testosterone. Khelif will next feature in a quarterfinal bout against Hungary's Anna Luca Hamori on Saturday.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A US appeals court on Thursday blocked the Federal Communications Commission's reinstatement of landmark net neutrality rules, saying broadband providers are likely to succeed in a legal challenge.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A US appeals court on Thursday blocked the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) reinstatement of landmark net neutrality rules, saying broadband providers are likely to succeed in a legal challenge.</p>

<p>The FCC voted in April along party lines to reassume regulatory oversight of broadband internet and reinstate open internet rules adopted in 2015 that were rescinded under then-President Donald Trump.</p>

<p>The Sixth Circuit US Court of Appeals, which had temporarily delayed the rules, said on Thursday it would temporarily block net neutrality rules and scheduled oral arguments for late October or early November on the issue, dealing a serious blow to President Joe Biden's effort to reinstate the rules.</p>

<p>"The final rule implicates a major question, and the commission has failed to satisfy the high bar for imposing such regulations," the court wrote. "Net neutrality is likely a major question requiring clear congressional authorisation."</p>

<p>The court on July 12 had temporarily placed the net neutrality rules on hold until August 5 as it considered industry legal challenges.</p>

<p>FCC Chair Jessica Rosenworcel said: "The American public wants an internet that is fast, open, and fair. Today's decision by the Sixth Circuit is a setback but we will not give up the fight for net neutrality."</p>

<p>Net neutrality rules require internet service providers to treat internet data and users equally rather than restricting access, slowing speeds or blocking content for certain users. The rules also forbid special arrangements in which ISPs give improved network speeds or access to favoured users.</p>

<p>The rules would bar internet service providers from blocking or slowing down traffic to certain websites, or engaging in paid prioritisation of lawful content, as well as give the FCC new tools to crack down on Chinese telecom companies and the ability to monitor internet service outages.</p>

<p>Reinstating net neutrality has been a priority for Biden, who signed a July 2021 executive order encouraging the FCC to reinstate the rules adopted in 2015 under President Barack Obama, a fellow Democrat.</p>

<p>Under Trump, the FCC had argued that net neutrality rules were unnecessary, blocked innovation and resulted in a decline in network investment by internet service providers, a contention disputed by Democrats.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk has backed Italian boxer Angela Carini after her loss to Algerian fighter Imane Khelif at the Paris Olympics 2024 on Thursday. The bout lasted only 46 seconds as Carini withdrew from the contest after she was struck multiple times in the face. The Italian boxer, on her knees, sobbed in the middle of the ring after the defeat. She did not shake hands with Khelif, who made her place in the quarterfinals of the category following the match.</p>

<p>Musk retweeted an X post by American swimmer Riley Gaines who wrote, "Men don't belong in women's sports #IStandWithAngelaCarini.”<br />
<br />
“Absolutely,” Musk wrote in a retweet of Gaines' initial message.</p>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

In another post, Musk dared Kamala Harris to comment on the controversy. "Kamala Harris supports this... Vote accordingly," an X user wrote to which Musk replied, "True or let her deny it."</p>

<p><br />
Italy's Prime Minister Georgian Meloni also reacted to Angela Carini's defeat and said that it "was not an even contest".<br />
<br />
"I have a big pain in my nose and I said, 'Stop'. It's better to avoid keeping going. My nose started dripping (with blood) from the first hit," Carini said.<br />
<br />
Khelif was cleared to take part in the Olympics despite getting disqualified from the 2023 women's world championships after she reportedly failed the <a href="http://https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/explained-womens-boxing-match-at-paris-olympics-sparks-gender-row-6241881">gender eligibility tests.</a><br />
<br />
The International Olympic Committee (IOC)'s decision to permit Khelif to compete has led to criticism from former female boxing champions, including Claressa Shields and Ebanie Bridges.<br />
<br />
The IOC allowed two boxers to compete in the 2024 Paris Olympics despite failing the gender eligibility tests for the World Boxing Championships last year.<br />
<br />
In 2023, the Algerian boxer suffered disqualification hours before the gold medal match at the women's World Championships. Khelif was reportedly disqualified for a high level of testosterone in her system.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Democrat Tim Walz and Republican JD Vance will face off next week in the only scheduled US vice presidential debate, a chance for each man to reinforce his running mate's message to voters just weeks before the November 5 election.</p>

<p>Here are some details about the event:</p>

<p><strong>WHEN AND WHERE IS THE DEBATE?</strong></p>

<p>The 90-minute debate, hosted by CBS News, will take place on October 1 at 9 pm ET (0100 GMT on Oct. 2) in New York City, a Democratic stronghold that is the former home of Donald Trump, the Republican presidential candidate running against Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris.</p>

<p><strong>WHO ARE THE MODERATORS?</strong></p>

<p>The debate will take place at the CBS Broadcast Center and be moderated by CBS "Evening News" anchor Norah O'Donnell and "Face the Nation" moderator Margaret Brennan.</p>

<p><strong>HOW CAN YOU WATCH THE DEBATE?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>The event will be broadcast on the CBS network and live streamed on all platforms where CBS News 24/7 and Paramount+ are available. CBS said it will also be made available to simulcast.</p>

<p>The Sept. 10 presidential debate between Harris and Trump on ABC News drew 67 million television viewers.</p>

<p><strong>WHAT ARE THE GROUND RULES?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>There will be no audience. Candidates will stand behind lecterns for the duration of the debate. No props or pre-written notes will be allowed on stage. CBS News reserves the right to turn off candidate microphones.</p>

<p><strong>WHAT TO EXPECT FROM WALZ</strong></p>

<p>Walz, the governor of Minnesota, will likely use his "regular guy" reputation to try to appeal to voters, including some independents, who view Harris, a former senator from California, as too liberal.</p>

<p>The 60-year-old Walz is a former congressman who won elections in a Republican-leaning district before becoming governor.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As governor, he has pushed a progressive agenda including free school meals, tax cuts for the middle class and expanded paid leave for Minnesota workers.</p>

<p>Walz will likely try to needle Vance, as Harris did successfully in her debate with Trump. Walz has questioned Vance's Midwestern credentials and derided his 2016 memoir "Hillbilly Elegy" for its depiction of rural America.</p>

<p>"Like all regular people I grew up with in the heartland, JD studied at Yale, had his career funded by Silicon Valley billionaires and then wrote a bestseller trashing that community," Walz said at his first rally as Harris' vice presidential pick. "Come on! That's not what middle America is."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Walz, also a former high school teacher and football coach, has dismissed Trump and Vance as "creepy and, yes, weird," - a takedown that spread widely among Democrats.</p>

<p>The Democratic vice presidential candidate has linked Vance to a set of conservative policy proposals known as Project 2025, from which Trump has tried to distance himself.</p>

<p><strong>WHAT TO EXPECT FROM VANCE</strong></p>

<p>Vance, a US senator from Ohio, will have to work hard not to be on the defensive throughout the debate if Walz employs Harris' debate strategy.</p>

<p>Vance, 40, likely will face questions about his inflammatory rhetoric and could punch back with his typical combative style.</p>

<p>He has been criticized for referring to Harris and other Democrats in 2021 as a "bunch of childless cat ladies," and more recently, for spreading false claims that Haitian migrants in the Ohio city of Springfield were eating pets.</p>

<p>He has also claimed without evidence that the suspect in the latest assassination attempt against Trump was acting on Democrats' inflammatory language.</p>

<p>"The big difference between conservatives and liberals is that ... no one has tried to kill Kamala Harris in the last couple of months and two people now have tried to kill Donald Trump in the last couple of months," said Vance in comments that drew a rebuke from the White House.</p>

<p>On the campaign trail, Vance has portrayed Walz and Harris as radical liberals.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He also has questioned Walz's depictions of his military record and his family's fertility struggles.</p>

<p>Vance, who served in the Marine Corps and was a public affairs officer during a six-month stint in Iraq, has accused Walz of leaving the Army National Guard to avoid being deployed to Iraq and of falsely suggesting he served in combat.</p>

<p>Walz, who served in the Guard for 24 years, retired to run for Congress. He has defended his record, but the Harris campaign has acknowledged he misspoke in a 2018 video in which he referenced "weapons of war that I carried into war." Walz never served in a combat zone.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[In the early years, getting AI models like ChatGPT or its rival Cohere to spit out human-like responses required vast teams of low-cost workers helping models distinguish basic facts such as if an image was of a car or a carrot.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the early years, getting AI models like ChatGPT or its rival Cohere to spit out human-like responses required vast teams of low-cost workers helping models distinguish basic facts such as if an image was of a car or a carrot.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But more sophisticated updates to AI models in the fiercely competitive arena are now demanding a rapidly expanding network of human trainers who have specialized knowledge -- from historians to scientists, some with doctorate degrees.</p>

<p>"A year ago, we could get away with hiring undergraduates, to just generally teach AI on how to improve," said Cohere co-founder Ivan Zhang, talking about its internal human trainers.</p>

<p>"Now we have licensed physicians teaching the models how to behave in medical environments, or financial analysts or accountants."</p>

<p>For more training, Cohere, which was last valued at over $5 billion, works with a startup called Invisible Tech. &nbsp;Cohere is one of the main rivals of OpenAI and specializes in AI for businesses.</p>

<p>The startup Invisible Tech employs thousands of trainers, working remotely, and has become one of the main partners of AI companies ranging from AI21 to Microsoft to train their AI models to reduce errors, known in the AI world as hallucinations.</p>

<p>"We have 5,000 people in over 100 countries around the world that are PhDs, Master's degree holders and knowledge work specialists," said Invisible founder Francis Pedraza.</p>

<p>Invisible pays as much as $40 per hour, depending on the location of the worker and the complexity of work. Some companies such as Outlier pay up to $50 per hour, while another company called Labelbox said it pays up to $200 per hour for "high expertise" subjects like quantum physics, but starts with $15 for basic topics.</p>

<p>Invisible was founded in 2015 as a workflow automation company catering to the likes of food delivery company DoorDash to digitize their delivery menu. But things changed when a relatively unknown research firm called OpenAI contacted them in the spring of 2022, ahead of the public launch of ChatGPT.</p>

<p>"OpenAI came to us with a problem, which is that when you were asking an early version of ChatGPT a question, it was going to hallucinate. You couldn't trust the answer," Pedraza told Reuters.</p>

<p>"They needed an advanced AI training partner to provide reinforcement learning with human feedback."</p>

<p>OpenAI did not respond to request for comment.</p>

<p>Generative AI produces new content based on past data used to train it. However, sometimes it can't distinguish between true and false information and generates false outputs known as hallucinations. In one notable example, in 2023 a Google chatbot shared inaccurate information about which satellite first took pictures of a planet outside the Earth's solar system in a promotional video.</p>

<p>AI companies are aware that hallucinations can derail GenAI's attractiveness to businesses and are trying various ways to reduce it, including using human trainers to teach the concept of fact and fiction.</p>

<p>Since getting onboard with OpenAI, Invisible says it has become AI training partners to most of the GenAI companies, including Cohere, AI21 and Microsoft. Cohere and AI21 confirmed they are clients. Microsoft did not confirm it is a client of Invisible.</p>

<p>"These are all companies that had training challenges, where their number one cost was compute power, and then the number two cost is quality training," Pedraza said.</p>

<p><strong>HOW DOES IT WORK?</strong></p>

<p>OpenAI, which started off the frenzy around GenAI, has a team of researchers aptly named "Human Data Team" that works with AI trainers to gather specialized data for training its models like ChatGPT.</p>

<p>OpenAI researchers come up with various experiments like reducing hallucinations or to improve writing style and work with AI trainers from Invisible and other vendors, a source familiar with the company's processes said.</p>

<p>At any point, dozens of experiments are being run, some with tools developed by OpenAI and others by tools of vendors, the person said.</p>

<p>Based on what the AI companies want - from getting better at Swedish history or doing financial modeling - Invisible hires workers with relevant degrees for those projects, reducing the burden of managing hundreds of trainers by the AI companies.</p>

<p>"OpenAI has some of the most incredible computer scientists in the world but they're not necessarily an expert in Swedish history or chemistry questions or biology questions or anything you can ask it," Pedraza said, adding that over 1,000 contract workers cater to OpenAI alone. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Cohere's Zhang said he has personally used Invisible's trainers to find a way to teach its GenAI model to find relevant information from a big data set.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>COMPETITION</strong></p>

<p>Among the competitors in this space is Scale AI, a private start-up last valued at $14 billion which provides AI companies with sets of training data. It has also ventured into the area of providing AI trainers, and counts OpenAI as a customer. &nbsp;Scale AI did not respond to requests for an interview for this story.</p>

<p>Invisible, which has been profitable since 2021, has raised only $8 million of primary capital, &nbsp;</p>

<p>"We are 70% owned by the team, and only 30% owned by investors," Pedraza said. "We do facilitate secondary rounds, and the most recent traded price was at a half a billion dollar valuation." Reuters could not confirm that valuation.</p>

<p>Human trainers first got into AI training through data-labelling work that required less qualification and was also paid less, sometimes as low as $2, mostly done by people in African and Asian countries.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As AI companies launch more advanced models, the demand for specialized trainers and across dozens of languages is on the rise, creating a well-paid niche where workers from a variety of subjects could become AI trainers without even knowing how to code.</p>

<p>Demand from AI companies is leading to the creation of more companies that are offering similar services.</p>

<p>"My inbox is basically inundated with new firms that pop up here and there. I do see this as a new space where companies hire humans just to create data for AI labs like us," Zhang said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The son of Mohamed Al-Fayed, the late former boss of Harrods accused of sexually assaulting scores of employees, has said the allegations had "thrown into question the loving memory I had of him".</p>

<p>Lawyers say some 60 women have come forward to allege they were abused by Fayed, who died last year aged 94, following a television documentary in which women accused him of raping and sexually assaulting them.</p>

<p>"I am horrified and deeply concerned by the allegations recently brought to light against my late father," said Omar Fayed in a statement.</p>

<p>"The extent and explicit nature of the allegations are shocking and has thrown into question the loving memory I had of him," he said.</p>

<p>"How this matter could have been concealed for so long and in so many ways raises further disturbing questions," he added.</p>

<p>The avalanche of accusations against the late Egyptian billionaire follow a BBC expose last week in which women recounted being targeted by Fayed when they worked for Harrods, the luxury department store in London he owned for 25 years.</p>

<p>His son said that although he loved his father "very much" and that he was a "wonderful dad, that aspect of our relationship... does not blind me from an objective assessment of circumstances".</p>

<p>The alleged victims deserved "full transparency and accountability," he added in a statement to Sky News late on Friday.</p>

<p>"I will continue to support the principles of truth, justice, accountability and fairness, regardless of where that journey may lead. No-one is above the law," he said.</p>

<p>Fayed's accusers say the assaults took place in his apartments in London and his properties in Paris, including the Ritz hotel.</p>

<p>Allegations include a repeated pattern of women who underwent a selection process for positions close to Fayed.</p>

<p>Once selected, they were subjected to an "invasive" gynaecological examination, the results of which were shared with Fayed.</p>

<p>The women said that when they tried to complain about their abuse, they were threatened by senior security staff, demoted and subjected to false allegations until they had "no choice" but to leave Harrods.</p>

<p>Fayed sold Harrods in 2010 to the investment arm of Qatar's sovereign wealth fund for a reported £1.5 billion ($2.2 billion).</p>

<p>He also owned Fulham Football Club and the Ritz Hotel in Paris.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden on Saturday called the killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah "a measure of justice for his many victims, including thousands of Americans, Israelis and Lebanese civilians."</p>

<p>In a statement a day after an Israeli air strike killed Nasrallah, Biden reiterated US support for "Israel's right to defend itself against Hezbollah, Hamas, the Houthis, and any other Iranian-supported terrorist groups."</p>

<p>Biden added that he had directed the defense secretary to "further enhance the defense posture of US military forces in the Middle East region to deter aggression and reduce the risk of a broader regional war."</p>

<p>Biden's statement came as the State Department ordered the family members of its diplomats in Beirut to leave, while authorizing the departure of some staff "due to the volatile and unpredictable security situation in Beirut."</p>

<p>The agency also urged US citizens to leave "while commercial options still remain available."</p>

<p>Military officials in Israel announced on Saturday morning that Nasrallah, who headed the armed movement for more than three decades, died in a bombardment targeting the group's headquarters in the southern suburbs of Beirut Friday night.</p>

<p>Hezbollah officially confirmed the death hours later.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on Saturday told the UN General Assembly that unviable projects raise debt levels and any connectivity that clouds sovereignty and territorial integrity acquires strategic connotations, especially when it is not a shared endeavour, in a veiled reference to China.</p>

<p>"We are gathered here at a difficult time. The world is yet to recover from the ravages of the Covid pandemic. A war in Ukraine is well into its third year. The conflict in Gaza is acquiring wider ramifications," Mr Jaishankar said in his address to the General Debate of the 79th session of the UN General Assembly.</p>

<p>Across the Global South, he said, development plans have gone off rails and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) targets are receding.</p>

<p>"But there is more. Unfair trade practices threaten jobs, just as unviable projects raise debt levels. Any connectivity that clouds sovereignty and territorial integrity acquires strategic connotations, especially when it is not a shared endeavour," he said, in an apparent reference to China's multi-billion-dollar Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).</p>

<p>Mr Jaishankar said technology advancements, which have long been a source of hope, are now equally a factor of anxiety.</p>

<p>"Climate events occur with greater intensity and frequency. Food security is as worrisome as health security. In truth, the world stands fractious, polarised and frustrated. Conversations have become difficult, agreements even more so. This is surely not what the founders of the United Nations would have wanted of us," he said.</p>

<p>The EAM said today, both peace and prosperity are equally endangered, and that is because trust has eroded and processes have broken down.</p>

<p>"Countries have extracted more from the international system than they have put into it, enfeebling it in the process," he said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Millions of Americans were still without power and many faced torrential flooding on Saturday, authorities said, as powerful storm Helene rumbled across eastern and midwestern US states, leaving at least 44 people dead.</p>

<p>At least 19 people died in South Carolina, 15 in Georgia, seven in Florida, two in North Carolina and one in Virgina, according to updated reports from local authorities tallied by AFP.</p>

<p>Repair crews were already at work after Helene slammed into Florida late Thursday as a Category 4 hurricane and surged north, gradually weakening but leaving a path of rare devastation.</p>

<p>"Conditions will continue to improve today following the catastrophic flooding over the past two days," said the National Weather Service.</p>

<p>But it warned of possible "long-duration power outages."</p>

<p>Though power has been restored in some areas, more than three million customers were still without electricity across 10 states as of midday Saturday, according to tracker poweroutage.us.</p>

<p><strong>'Move to higher ground'</strong></p>

<p>Helene originally slammed into Florida's northern Gulf shore with powerful winds of 140 miles (225 kilometers) per hour. Even as a weakened post-tropical cyclone, it has caused destruction.</p>

<p>Record levels of flooding threatened to breach dams, with one dam in Tennessee on the verge of failure, authorities said, urging residents to move to higher ground.</p>

<p>Massive flooding was reported in Asheville, a city in western North Carolina. Governor Ray Cooper called it "one of the worst storms in modern history" to hit his state.</p>

<p>In Cedar Key, an island city of 700 people just off Florida's northwest coast, the full destructive force of the hurricane was on view.</p>

<p>Several pastel-colored wooden homes were destroyed, victims of record storm surges and ferocious winds.</p>

<p>"I've lived here my whole life, and it breaks my heart to see it. We've not really been able to catch a break," said Gabe Doty, a Cedar Key official, referring to two earlier hurricanes in the past year.</p>

<p><strong>'Gut punch'</strong></p>

<p>In South Carolina the dead included two firefighters and six residents of Spartanburg County, officials said.</p>

<p>Georgia Governor Brian Kemp's office confirmed 15 deaths in his state, including an emergency responder.</p>

<p>Governor Ron DeSantis of Florida said the damage from Helene exceeded that of hurricanes Idalia and Debby, which both hit the same region southeast of Tallahassee in the last 13 months.</p>

<p>"It's a real gut punch to those communities," DeSantis told Fox News.</p>

<p>In the Tennessee town of Erwin, a dramatic rescue operation unfolded, as more than 50 patients and staff trapped on a hospital roof by surging floodwaters had to be rescued by helicopters.</p>

<p>Up to 12 inches (30 centimeters) of rain was forecast in the Appalachian mountains, with isolated spots receiving 20 inches.</p>

<p>Remnants of the weakened storm were hovering at midday Saturday over the Kentucky-Indiana border, bringing up to 2 inches of rain.</p>

<p><strong>'Overwhelming' damage</strong></p>

<p>In a statement Saturday, President Joe Biden called Helene's devastation "overwhelming." He said he was sending additional response personnel as the storm tracks north.</p>

<p>Vice President Kamala Harris said the administration had already mobilized 1,500 personnel to support impacted communities.</p>

<p>September has been an unusually wet month around the world, with scientists linking some extreme weather events to human-caused global warming.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>SpaceX,&nbsp;the private company founded by billionaire Elon Musk, today launched a rescue mission with two passengers on board, leaving two seats empty to return the American astronauts who have been stranded for months on the International Space Station, NASA said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Falcon 9 rocket took off from Cape Canaveral, Florida. It used a new launch pad, the pad's first use for a crewed mission.</p>

<p>On board are NASA astronaut Nick Hague and Russian cosmonaut Alexander Gorbunov. &nbsp;</p>

<p>"Congrats to @NASA and @SpaceX on a successful launch," NASA chief Bill Nelson said in a post on X. "We live in an exciting period of exploration and innovation in the stars."</p>

<p>When they return from the space station in February, they will bring back the two space veterans -- Butch Wilmore and Sunita Williams -- whose stay on the ISS was prolonged for months by problems with their Boeing-designed Starliner spacecraft.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The newly developed Starliner was making its first crewed flight when it delivered Wilmore and Williams to the ISS in June.</p>

<p>The astronauts were supposed to be there for only an eight-day stay, but after problems with the Starliner's propulsion system emerged during the flight there, NASA was forced to weigh a radical change in plans.&nbsp;<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar today sent a strongly-worded warning to Pakistan when he addressed the 79th United Nations General Assembly session in New York today.</p>

<p>Talking about Pakistan's decades-old policy of terrorism, Mr Jaishankar warned Islamabad that its "actions will most certainly have consequences".</p>

<p>Mr Jaishankar, who spoke about the 'Pakistan problem' towards the end of his nearly-twenty-minute speech, made it clear to Islamabad that "Pakistan's policy of cross-border terrorism can and will never succeed".</p>

<p>Pakistan, which has been facing its worst economic crises since its formation in 1947, has been left behind because of its "conscious choices with disastrous consequences", the External Affairs Minister said.</p>

<p>"Many countries get left behind due to circumstances beyond their control. But some make conscious choices with disastrous consequences. A premier example is our neighbour, Pakistan. Unfortunately, their misdeeds affect others as well, especially the neighbourhood," Mr Jaishankar said.</p>

<p>Highlighting the impact of Islamabad's terror policies, Mr Jaishankar said "When this polity instils such fanaticism among its people, its GDP can only be measured in terms of radicalisation and its exports in the form of terrorism."</p>

<p>Taking a swipe at Pakistan's fate due to is policy of radicalising its citizens, especially the youth, the foreign minister said, "Today, we see the ills it sought to visit on others consume its own society. It can't blame the world; this is only karma,"</p>

<p>The foreign minister further said that "A dysfunctional nation coveting the lands of others must be exposed and must be countered. We heard some bizarre assertions from it at this forum yesterday. So let me make India's position perfectly clear."</p>

<p>Just before concluding his speech, Mr Jaishankar said, "Pakistan's cross-border terrorism policy will never succeed. And it can have no expectation of impunity," adding that "On the contrary, actions will certainly have consequences. The issue to be resolved between us is now only the vacation of illegally occupied Indian territory by Pakistan. And of course, the abandonment of Pakistan's longstanding attachment to terrorism."<br />

       <description><![CDATA[The killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in airstrikes in a Beirut suburb has put the spotlight on the man widely regarded as his heir, Hashem Safieddine.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in airstrikes in a Beirut suburb has put the spotlight on the man widely regarded as his heir, Hashem Safieddine.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Iran-backed group confirmed that Nasrallah, who led the group for 32 years, had been killed in Friday's strike. It now faces the challenge of choosing a new leader after the heaviest pounding the group has faced in its 42-year-old history.</p>

<p>Here are some facts about Safieddine, who a source in the group said survived the Israeli attacks.</p>

<ul>
	<li>As head of the executive council, Safieddine oversees Hezbollah's political affairs. He also sits on the Jihad Council, which manages the group's military operations.</li>
	<li>Safieddine is a cousin of Nasrallah and like him is a cleric who wears the black turban denoting descent from Islam's Prophet Mohammed.</li>
	<li>The US State Department designated him a terrorist in 2017 and in June he threatened a big escalation against Israel after the killing of another Hezbollah commander. "Let (the enemy) prepare himself to cry and wail," he said at the funeral.</li>
	<li>Safieddine's public statements often reflect Hezbollah's militant stance and its alignment with the Palestinian cause.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>At a recent event in Dahiyeh, Hezbollah's stronghold in Beirut's southern suburbs, he declared, "Our history, our guns and our rockets are with you," in a show of solidarity with Palestinian fighters.</li>
	<li>Nasrallah "started tailoring positions for him within a variety of different councils within Lebanese Hezbollah. Some of them were more opaque than others. They've had him come, go out and speak," said Phillip Smyth, an expert who studies Iran-backed Shi-ite militias.</li>
	<li>Safieddine's family ties and a physical resemblance to Nasrallah, as well as his religious status as a descendant of Mohammed, would all count in his favour.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>He has also been vocal in his criticism of U.S. policy. In response to American pressure on Hezbollah, he stated in 2017, "This mentally impeded, crazy U.S. administration headed by Trump will not be able to harm the resistance," asserting that such actions would only strengthen Hezbollah's resolve.</li>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Middle East nations and Hezbollah's allies in the Tehran-aligned "Axis of Resistance" reacted on Saturday to the killing of Hassan Nasrallah after the Lebanon-based armed group confirmed their leader's death in Israeli strikes.</p>

<p>Military officials in Israel announced on Saturday morning that Nasrallah, who headed Hezbollah for more than three decades, died in bombardment targeting the group's headquarters in the southern suburbs of Beirut Friday night.</p>

<p>Hezbollah officially confirmed the death hours later.</p>

<p><strong>Hezbollah</strong></p>

<p>Hezbollah confirmed in a statement that Nasrallah had been killed, saying he had "joined his great, immortal martyr comrades whom he led for about 30 years".</p>

<p>The group said he was killed with other members "following the treacherous Zionist strike on the southern suburbs" of Beirut.</p>

<p><strong>Israel</strong></p>

<p>The Israeli military described the Hezbollah chief as one of Israel's "greatest enemies of all time".</p>

<p>Military spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said, "His elimination makes the world a safer place," but Hagari added the group's remaining senior members would still be targeted.</p>

<p>Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz said Nasrallah "deserved" to die.</p>

<p>"The elimination of arch-terrorist Nasrallah is one of the most justified counter-terrorism actions Israel has ever taken," Katz said in a post on social media platform X.</p>

<p><strong>Iran</strong></p>

<p>Iran, which arms and finances Hezbollah, said the direction Nasrallah set for the Lebanese group, which for nearly a year had engaged in cross-border fire with Israeli forces, would be maintained.</p>

<p>"The glorious path of the leader of the resistance, Hassan Nasrallah, will continue and his sacred goal will be realised in the liberation of Quds (Jerusalem), God willing," foreign ministry spokesman Nasser Kanani said</p>

<p>Iran's First Vice President Mohammad Reza Aref issued a warning to Israel's leaders "that the unjust bloodshed... especially of Hezbollah's secretary general, martyr Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, will bring about their destruction," Iran's ISNA news agency quoted Aref as saying.</p>

<p><strong>Hamas</strong></p>

<p>Palestinian group Hamas condemned Nasrallah's assassination "in the strongest terms" and criticised the strikes on southern Beirut as "barbaric Zionist aggression and targeting of residential buildings".</p>

<p>"We consider it a cowardly terrorist act," the group said in a statement that offered "condolences, and solidarity with the brothers in Hezbollah and the Islamic Resistance in Lebanon on the martyrdom of... Nasrallah".</p>

<p>The Hezbollah chief had said his fighters' rocket fire over the border into Israel was in "support" of Hamas.</p>

<p><strong>Yemen's Huthis</strong></p>

<p>Yemen's Huthi rebels said Nasrallah's killing would strengthen their determination to confront their Israeli foes.</p>

<p>"The martyrdom of... Hassan Nasrallah will increase the flame of sacrifice, the heat of enthusiasm, the strength of resolve," the rebels' leadership council said in a statement, vowing to achieve "victory and the demise of the Israeli enemy".</p>

<p><strong>Iraq</strong></p>

<p>Iraq's Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani condemned the slaying of the Hezbollah chief as a "crime that shows the Zionist entity has crossed all the red lines".</p>

<p>In a statement, he called the Israeli strikes on south Beirut a "shameful attack" and described Nasrallah as "a martyr on the path of the righteous".<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Saturday the killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah would be avenged and his path in fighting Israel would be continued by other militants.</p>

<p>"(Nasrallah) was not an individual. He was a path and a school of thought and the path will be continued," Ayatollah Khamenei said in a statement read on state television in which he announced five days of mourning in Iran.</p>

<p>"The blood of the martyr shall not go unavenged," he said.</p>

<p>Ayatollah Khamenei, in an earlier statement issued after the Israeli army said it had killed Nasrallah, said: "The fate of this region will be determined by the forces of resistance, with Hezbollah at the forefront," state media reported.</p>

<p>After Hezbollah confirmed Nasrallah's death, Iranian media reported that General Abbas Nilforoushan, a deputy commander of Iran's Revolutionary Guards, had died "next to Nasrallah" in the Israeli strikes on south Beirut on Friday.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian blamed Nasrallah's killing partly on the United States, which has long supplied Israel with advanced weapons.</p>

<p>"The Americans cannot deny their complicity with the Zionists," Pezeshkian said in a statement carried by state media.</p>

<p>Iranian foreign ministry spokesperson Nasser Kanaani vowed in a post on X that Nasrallah's "path will be continued and his holy goal will be realised in the liberation of Jerusalem".</p>

<p>Meanwhile, two regional officials briefed by Tehran told Reuters that Ayatollah Khamenei has been transferred to a secure location inside the country with heightened security measures in place.</p>

<p>The sources said Iran was in constant contact with Lebanon's Hezbollah and other regional proxy groups to determine the next step after the killing of Nasrallah.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>SpaceX CEO Elon Musk today shared a stunning high-definition video of the Polaris space mission around Earth. Sharing the video highlights, Mr Musk said, "Looks like CGI (Computer-Generated Imagery), but it is real".</p>

<p>According to the mission's official website, the Polaris space programme is a "first-of-its-kind effort to rapidly advance human spaceflight capabilities, while continuing to raise funds and awareness for important causes on Earth."</p>

<p>The Polaris space programme includes three human spaceflight missions that will demonstrate new technologies, conduct extensive research and ultimately culminate in the first flight of SpaceX's Starship with humans on board.</p>

<h2><strong>Here is the video highlights of the Polaris mission that SpaceX and Elon Musk and shared:</strong></h2>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Looks like CGI, but these are all real video highlights from the <a href="https://twitter.com/PolarisProgram?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@PolarisProgram</a> space mission<br />
<a href="https://t.co/CLCzhJndF5">pic.twitter.com/CLCzhJndF5</a></p>
— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1839732943914176535?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 27, 2024</a></blockquote>

<h3><strong>MISSION I - POLARIS DAWN</strong></h3>

<p>The first of the three missions have already happened, while two others will happen "soon", the mission website says, adding that 'Mission I' - named Polaris Dawn - sent a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket to low-Earth orbit from the launchpad at NASA's Kennedy Space Centre at Cape Canaveral in Florida. The spaceship launched earlier this month - September 10. The crew on board completed all four mission objectives before returning to Earth on September 15.</p>

<h3><strong>THE OBJECTIVE</strong></h3>

<p>The Polaris Dawn mission tested the Falcon 9 and Dragon's maximum performance, flying higher than any Dragon mission to date, reaching the highest Earth orbit ever flown with a peak apogee of 1,408.1 kilometers above Earth. Orbiting through portions of the Van Allen radiation belt, the Polaris Dawn crew conducted research with the aim of better understanding the effects of spaceflight and space radiation on human health.</p>

<h3><strong>THE SPACEWALK</strong></h3>

<p>At altitudes ranging between approximately 190 and 740 kilometers above the Earth, the crew completed the first-ever commercial spacewalk. It was performed in SpaceX-designed extravehicular activity or EVA spacesuits, upgraded from the current intravehicular or IVA suit.</p>

<h3><strong>FUTURE MISSIONS</strong></h3>

<p>'Mission II', which is yet to be named, will build upon the first one and will continue to excel in areas of in-space communications while carrying out other research work.</p>

<p>The third mission - 'Mission III', which also doesn't have a name yet, will be the first-human sapceflight on SpaceX's Starship, which is the world's first reusable transportation system designed to carry both crew and cargo to Earth orbit. It aims to fly to the Moon and Mars, and someday, even beyond.</p>

<p>According to the mission website, the program are named after Polaris, a constellation of three stars more commonly known as the North Star, which has been a guiding light throughout human history to help us navigate the world and inspire progress.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[The annular solar eclipse of 2024 is set to occur on October 2, Wednesday. According to Space.com, during this astronomical phenomenon, the Moon will appear smaller than the Sun, leaving a bright ring of sunlight visible around the darkened centre.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The annular solar eclipse of 2024 is set to occur on October 2, Wednesday. According to <em>Space.com,</em> during this astronomical phenomenon, the Moon will appear smaller than the Sun, leaving a bright ring of sunlight visible around the darkened centre. This celestial spectacle, also known as the "Ring of Fire," will be visible for over six hours, starting at 9:13 PM IST and ending at 3:17 PM IST the next day. During the peak, the Moon will create the "ring of fire" effect for viewers within the path of annularity.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Is the annular solar eclipse visible from India?&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>This celestial event will be visible across parts of the Pacific Ocean, southern Chile and southern Argentina. However, skywatchers in India will be disappointed. Due to the timing of the eclipse occurring at night, it will not be observable from the country.</p>

<p>Consequently, the Sutak Kaal period, a time of observation traditionally followed during eclipses, will not be applicable in India.</p>

<p>This event provides an opportunity for astronomy enthusiasts and skywatchers to prepare for a captivating astronomical event. Remember, proper safety precautions are crucial when viewing a solar eclipse directly.</p>

<h3><strong>What is a 'ring of fire' solar eclipse?</strong></h3>

<p>According to NASA, this event occurs when the Moon passes directly in front of the Sun, but appears too small to completely cover the Sun's surface - resulting in what appears as a ring of fire in the sky.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Moon revolves around the Earth in an elliptical orbit, so at two points each month, it is farthest (apogee) and closest (perigee) to Earth, making the Moon appear slightly smaller and slightly larger than average in our sky.</p>

<h3><strong>What is a solar eclipse?&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>According to NASA, Solar eclipses occur when the Sun, the Moon, and Earth line up, either fully or partially. Depending on how they align, eclipses provide a unique, exciting view of either the Sun or the Moon.</p>

<p>A solar eclipse happens when the Moon passes between the Sun and Earth, casting a shadow on Earth that either fully or partially blocks the Sun's light in some areas. This only happens occasionally, because the Moon doesn't orbit in the exact same plane as the Sun and Earth do. The time when they are aligned is known as eclipse season, which happens twice a year.</p>

<p>It is to be noted that it is never safe to look directly at the Sun. But those who want to witness it, should use certified eclipse glasses, or make a cardboard pinhole projector.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Iran's foreign ministry said Saturday the path of Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah will continue despite his killing in an Israeli air strike in Beirut, after a year of cross-border clashes between the two sides.</p>

<p>"The glorious path of the leader of the resistance, Hassan Nasrallah, will continue and his sacred goal will be realised in the liberation of Quds (Jerusalem), God willing," foreign ministry spokesman Nasser Kanani said in a post on social media X, mourning Nasrallah's death.</p>

<p>Lebanon's Hezbollah group, armed and financed by Iran, on Saturday confirmed Nasrallah had been killed, after Israel said it had "eliminated" him in an air strike a day earlier.</p>

<p>The statement confirmed he was killed with other group members "following the treacherous Zionist strike on the southern suburbs" of Beirut.</p>

<p>Iranian vice president Mohammad Javad Zarif also expressed his condolences, praising Nasrallah as a "symbol of the fight against oppression."</p>

<p>Hezbollah is listed as terrorist group by the United States.</p>

<p>A black flag for mourning was hoisted at the Shiite Islam holy Imam Reza shrine in Iran's northeastern city Mashhad, according to the local Tasnim news agency.</p>

<p>Mourners gathered there, waving yellow Hezbollah banners, along with Iranian flags as they chanted, "Death to Israel," state TV showed.</p>

<p>Lebanon's health ministry gave a preliminary death count of six dead and 91 wounded from the latest strikes on Beirut's densely populated southern suburbs since Friday, the fiercest to hit Hezbollah's stronghold since Israel and the group last went to war in 2006.</p>

<p>Earlier on Saturday, Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei condemned what he called an Israeli "massacre" in Lebanon and lambasted the "shortsighted" Israeli policy.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sending humans to Mars seems to be the new milestone in space exploration. However, the dream of colonising Mars appears difficult to achieve due to the brutal conditions on the planet, which experts have warned can cause people to turn green and lose their eyesight. According to <em>Indy100</em>, biologist Dr Scott Solomon from Rice University in Texas, US, explained that children born to human settlers on the Red Planet would experience a series of drastic mutations and evolutionary changes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In his book, Future Humans, Dr Solomon claimed that due to the incredibly harsh conditions on the surface of Mars, it could be extremely difficult for humans to survive, let alone thrive, on the Red Planet. He wrote that if human settlers on Mars give birth to children, the latter are likely to undergo various drastic mutations and evolutionary changes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>These mutations can occur because of low gravitation forces and high radiation and can result in green skin tone, weak muscles, poor eyesight and brittle bones, Dr Solomon explained.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.indy100.com/science-tech/mars-human-beings-mutations-radiation" rel="noindex, nofollow"><em>Indy100</em></a>, Mars is a smaller planet than Earth and has 30% less gravity than we have evolved to live with. The Red Planet also lacks a magnetic field, and a protective ozone layer, leaving the planet open to space radiation, UV and charged particles from the sun and cosmic rays.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This kind of environment has led to the mutation of humans at extreme rates so that they can cope with new conditions. This, Dr Solomon explained, could see skin colour change to help cope with radiation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Perhaps in the face of this high radiation, we might evolve some new type of skin pigment to help us deal with that radiation. Maybe we get our own green men," he wrote in his book.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Moreover, the expert claimed that brittle bones brought on by the lack of gravity could cause women's pelvises to break during childbirth. He also argued that eyesight could start to become weaker due to the reduction of the need to see far distances, as humans would be living together in small enclaves.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Notably, so far, only uncrewed spacecraft have made the trip to Mars, but that could soon change. US space agency NASA is hoping to land the first humans on Mars by the 2030s and SpaceX chief Elon Musk recently said that humans could be living in a city on the Red Planet in the next 30 years. Several new missions are also launching before these given timelines to push exploration forward.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Lashing out after the death of Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah and civilians in strikes on Lebanon's Beirut, Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has said the savage nature of the "rabid Zionist regime" has been revealed.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lashing out after the death of Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah and civilians in strikes on Lebanon's Beirut, Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has said the savage nature of the "rabid Zionist regime" has been revealed. Mr Khamenei's statement came on Saturday, amid reports that he had been moved to a secure location after Nasrallah's killing and at a time when the world's eyes are on Iran to see what steps it takes after the attacks on one of its closest allies.</p>

<p>The Iranian Supreme Leader also called Israel's war against Hamas - another partner in Iran's 'Axis of Resistance' against the Jewish country - &nbsp;in Gaza a "criminal" one and called upon all Muslims to stand with Hezbollah and the people of Lebanon.</p>

<p>"The massacre of defenceless people in Lebanon has once again revealed the savage nature of the rabid Zionist regime, and at the same time, it has proven the short-sightedness and foolish policies of the heads of the usurping regime. The terror group ruling the Zionist regime has failed to learn a lesson from its year-long criminal war in Gaza. They have not understood that the mass killing of women, children, and civilians cannot weaken or dismantle the strong structure of the resistance organisation," Mr Khamenei said in a statement, which did not mention what were, until then, Israel's claims of killing the Hezbollah chief.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Accusing the Israeli government of testing the "same foolish policies" in Lebanon, Mr Khamenei said it is "too insignificant" to inflict any significant damage to Hezbollah's foundation in Lebanon.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"All the resistance forces in the region stand beside and support Hezbollah. The destiny of this region will be shaped by the forces of resistance, with the proud Hezbollah at the forefront. The people of Lebanon have not forgotten the days when the military of the usurping regime marched to Beirut. It was Hezbollah that cut off their advance and brought dignity and pride to Lebanon. Today, with God's strength, Lebanon will again force the vile, malevolent enemy to regret its actions," he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Giving a call for Muslims to stand with Lebanon and Hezbollah, he added, "It is incumbent upon all Muslims to stand with the people of Lebanon and the proud Hezbollah with all their resources and support them in their confrontation with the usurping, oppressive, and malicious regime."</p>

<p>News agency Reuters reported that, after Nasrallah's death, Mr Khamenei has been moved to a secure location. Sources told the agency that Iran is in touch with Hezbollah and other groups in the region to assess what the country's next steps can be.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Israel has, over the past few days, shifted the focus of its operation from Gaza to Lebanon and its heavy bombing has killed more than 700 people and displaced over 1 lakh. Its operations have continued despite growing international calls for a ceasefire, including from the US.</p>

<p>Israel's army chief Lieutenant General Herzi Halevi on Saturday said: "The message is simple, anyone who threatens the citizens of Israel: we will know how to reach them."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah has been killed, the Iran-backed group said on Saturday, confirming his death after the Israeli military said it had eliminated him in an airstrike in Beirut the day before.</p>

<p>His death marks a devastating blow to Hezbollah as it reels from an escalating campaign of Israeli attacks. It is also a huge blow to Iran, given the major role he has played in the Tehran-backed regional "Axis of Resistance".</p>

<p>Hezbollah said in a statement that it would continue its battle against Israel "in support of Gaza and Palestine, and in defence of Lebanon and its steadfast and honourable people". It did not say how Nasrallah was killed.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said earlier that Nasrallah was eliminated in a "targeted strike" on Friday on the group's underground headquarters beneath a residential building in Dahiyeh - a Hezbollah-controlled southern suburb of Beirut.</p>

<p>It said he was killed along with another top Hezbollah leader, Ali Karaki, and other commanders.</p>

<p>"The strike was conducted while Hezbollah's senior chain of command were operating from the headquarters and advancing terrorist activities against the citizens of the State of Israel," it said.</p>

<p>Friday's airstrike on Dahiyeh shook Beirut. A security source in Lebanon said the attack - a quick succession of massively powerful blasts - had left a crater at least 20 metres (65 feet) deep.</p>

<p>It was followed on Saturday by further airstrikes on Dahiyeh and other parts of Lebanon. Huge explosions lit up the night sky, and more strikes hit the area in the morning. Smoke rose over the city.</p>

<p>Residents have fled Dahiyeh, seeking shelter in downtown Beirut and other parts of the city.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>British colonialism turned India's tigers into trophies. Between 1860 and 1950, more than 65,000 were shot for their <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/epdf/10.1177/025764309801400206">skins</a>. The fortunes of the Bengal tiger, one of Earth's biggest species of big cat, did not markedly improve post-independence. The hunting of tigers – and the animals they eat, like deer and wild pigs – continued, while large tracts of their forest habitat became farmland.</p>

<p>India established Project Tiger in 1972 when there were <a href="https://ntca.gov.in/assets/uploads/Reports/Joining_the_dot.pdf">fewer than 2,000 tigers</a> remaining; it is now one of the world's longest-running conservation programmes. The project aimed to protect and increase tiger numbers by creating reserves from existing protected areas like national parks and wildlife sanctuaries. Part of that process has involved forcing people to relocate.</p>

<p>In protected areas globally, nature conservationists can find themselves at odds with the needs of <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.1525003113">local communities</a>. Some scientists have argued that, in order for them to thrive, tigers need forests that are completely free of people who might otherwise graze livestock or collect firewood. In a few documented cases, the tiger population has indeed recovered once people were <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10344-008-0219-2">removed from tiger reserves</a>.</p>

<p>But in pitting people against wildlife, relocations foster bigger problems that do not serve the long-term interests of conservation.</p>

<h2>India's Relocation Policy</h2>

<p>Under Project Tiger, 27 tiger reserves were established by 2005, each spanning somewhere between 500 and 2,500 square kilometres. Tiger reserves have a core in which people are prevented from grazing livestock, hunting wildlife and collecting wood, leaves and flowers. A buffer zone encircles this. Here, such activities are allowed, but regulated.</p>

<p>About 3,000 families were <a href="https://ntca.gov.in/assets/uploads/Reports/Joining_the_dot.pdf">relocated</a> from these core zones in the first three decades of the project, and from 2005 until 2023, about 22,000 families were moved. Most relocations were involuntary and some plunged those ousted into deeper poverty.</p>

</figure>

<p>In Sariska tiger reserve in Rajasthan, northwestern India, the first relocation was made during 1976-77. Some of the families returned to the reserve after being given land unsuitable for farming as compensation. This was a poor advertisement for relocation which few other communities <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262127259_Creation_of_'Inviolate_Space'_Lives_Livelihoods_and_Conflict_in_Sariska_Tiger_Reserve">opted for voluntarily</a>.</p>

<p>After they were moved from Rajaji tiger reserve in 2012, Gujjar pastoralists who make their living grazing buffalo were prompted to take up farming on new land. With little experience in agriculture, and having been denied their traditional source of income, many struggled to adjust.</p>

<p>The Gujjar did at least gain access to <a href="https://india.mongabay.com/2023/06/commentary-a-decade-after-relocation-the-lives-of-van-gujjars-still-lack-stability-and-security/">water pumps and electricity</a>. In one case, in the Bhadra tiger reserve in Karnataka, southwestern India, relocation was less painful as people were offered quality agricultural land who already had <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000632070700273X">prior farming experience</a>.</p>

<p>Most people who lost their right to graze livestock or collect forest produce in newly established tiger reserves went on to labour in tea and coffee plantations or factories.</p>

<p>Despite widespread relocations, the tiger population in India continued to plummet, reaching an all-time low of fewer than 1,500 in 2006. Tigers <a href="https://ntca.gov.in/assets/uploads/Reports/Joining_the_dot.pdf">became extinct</a> in Sariska and Panna tiger reserves in 2004 and 2007 respectively.</p>

<p>Local extinction in Sariska prompted the government to enlist the help of tiger biologists and social scientists in 2005. This task force found that illegal hunting of tigers was still happening, their claws, teeth, bones and skin harvested <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/business/environment/india-says-chinese-medicine-fuels-tiger-poaching-idUSTRE58G4XQ/">for use in Chinese medicine</a>. Mining and grazing had also continued within many reserves.</p>

<h2>Corridors Of Power</h2>

<p>The tiger task force acknowledged that having the local community onside helped prevent illegal hunting and forest fires. The Soliga tribes of Biligiri Rangananthaswamy temple tiger reserve in Karnataka decided not to relocate when offered compensation, but instead took up work rooting out invasive plants like lantana and <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320720309460">curbing illegal hunting and timber felling</a>. The Soliga are among the very few communities who have been rewarded with rights in tiger reserves.</p>

<p>Similarly, in Parambikulam tiger reserve in Kerala, a state on India's tropical Malabar coast, communities that were not relocated found work as tour guides and forest guards. People here have supplemented their income by collecting and selling honey, wild gooseberry and medicinal spices, under the joint supervision of the community and forest department officials. Many families have been able to give up cattle rearing as a result, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666719320300145#:%7E:text=The%2520conversion%2520of%2520Parambikulam%2520Wildlife,cattle%2520in%2520the%2520Tiger%2520Reserve.">reducing grazing pressure</a> on the forest.</p>

</figure>

<p>Despite these successes, the government's policy of relocation remains.</p>

<p>Tiger numbers have recovered to more than 3,000 as of 2022, but Project Tiger shows that relocation alone cannot conserve tigers indefinitely.</p>

<p>A great opportunity awaits. Over 38 million hectares of forest, <a href="https://ntca.gov.in/assets/uploads/Reports/AITM/Tiger_Status_Report_2018.pdf">suitable tiger habitat</a>, lies outside tiger reserves. Declaring these forests “corridors” that allow tigers to move between reserves could <a href="https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/pan3.10177">reduce the risk</a> of inbreeding and local extinction and reinforce the recovery of India's tigers.</p>

<p>Studies in certain tiger reserves show that large numbers of villagers would <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264837718312900">support further relocations</a> if it meant gaining access to drinking water, schools, healthcare and jobs in resettlement sites. A portion of the US$30 million (£22.7 million) <a href="https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=1810562">spent annually</a> by Project Tiger should be used to make relocations fair. Or better yet, promote the kind of community-based conservation nurtured in the Biligiri Ranganathaswamy temple and Parambikulam tiger reserves.</p>

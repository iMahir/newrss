       <description><![CDATA[Jordan Brielle, a 32-year-old Ohio woman, suffered serious health issues after becoming addicted to vaping. Despite her deteriorating health, Brielle continued to vape, eventually leading to a medically induced coma.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An American woman in Ohio is on the mend after being put in a medically induced coma due to serious health problems stemming from her vaping habit. Jordan Brielle, 32, had two litres of "black and bloody" fluid removed from her lungs by doctors, according to <em>The New York Post. </em>Brielle started smoking when she was still a teenager but kicked over to vaping in 2021.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/09/16/lifestyle/vaping-addict-finally-quit-when-lungs-collapsed-black-goo-came-out/">According to her</a>, she became addicted very fast, and it became a strain on her pocket as she found herself spending up to $500 every week on vape products. "I was totally addicted," she said. "I was vaping so much that I slept with it and even took it into the shower."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't wish what I'd been through on anyone else. I feel grateful to be alive," Ms Brielle said.</p>

<p>This heavy vaping continued for two years until Brielle began to feel "heaviness" in her lungs last November, which was then diagnosed at first as a respiratory infection. Given her deteriorating health condition and troubled breathing, as well as persistent coughing, Brielle continued vaping.</p>

<p>She went to the hospital several times complaining of breathing problems.</p>

<p>"I had a horrible cough and was going to the hospital two or three times a week for help. I had little to no voice," <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/09/16/lifestyle/vaping-addict-finally-quit-when-lungs-collapsed-black-goo-came-out/">Brielle recalled.</a> "Each time they would send me home. It felt like there were 80 pounds of pressure just lying on my chest. I'd never felt so sick in my life."</p>

<p>The situation worsened when her boyfriend discovered her unconscious with "black mucus coming out of my mouth and my nose." He said he could see she was breathing, but she wasn't reacting, with a very weak pulse.</p>

<p>Her boyfriend immediately dialled 911 and stayed beside her until the paramedics could reach her. They were able to rush her to the hospital, and doctors could extract the toxic substance from her lungs. Brielle's life story opens your eyes to the dangers of vaping; it is also a realisation of what health implications you will get from vaping.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A series of walkie-talkie explosions caught Lebanon unawares today, killing at least nine people so far. According to Lebanon health ministry, over 300 people have been injured. This comes a day after the explosion of thousands of pagers sent shockwaves across the country, killing 12 people and injuring a whopping 2,800.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Today's blasts happened across southern Lebanon as well as Beirut's suburbs. At least one of the blasts happened near a funeral organised by Hezbollah for a member who was killed in yesterday's pager blasts. A video of the incident was widely circulated on social media platforms.</p>

<p>Iran-backed Hezbollah said today that it attacked Israeli artillery positions with rockets in the first strike at its arch-rival since pager blasts wounded thousands of its members in Lebanon and raised the prospect of a wider Middle East war.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Twin attacks using communication devices, suspected to have an Israeli hand, have struck fear in the ranks of Hezbollah, the Iran-backed militant group based in Lebanon.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<ol>
	<li>At least nine people have been killed and over 100 wounded when hand-held radios or walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah exploded across the south of Lebanon and the group's strongholds in the country's capital, Beirut, on Wednesday.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>One of the blasts occurred near a funeral organised by Hezbollah for those killed when thousands of pagers exploded across Lebanon on Tuesday. The number of people dead in Tuesday's explosions has risen to 12, including two children.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>The attacks have raised Hezbolah's tensions with Israel - which it has blamed for the pager explosions - that were already high because of Tel Aviv's war with Hamas in Gaza, and the group said it had used rockets to attack Israeli artillery positions</li>
	<li>The coordinated targeting of communication devices used by Hezbollah is being widely seen as an attempt to throw the group in disarray and a way of demonstrating to its members that the attackers can get at them in ways they least expect.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>A senior Lebanese security source and another person in the know told news agency Reuters that Israel's spy agency Mossad, which has a long history of carrying out sophisticated operations on foreign soil, planted explosives inside pagers imported by Hezbollah months before they went off on Tuesday.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>The senior Lebanese security source told Reuters the group had ordered 5,000 pagers made by Taiwan-based Gold Apollo and another source said three grams of explosives had been hidden in each of the ordered devices, which had gone undetected for months. Gold Apollo said the devices were made under licence by a company called BAC, based in Hungary.</li>
	<li>Iran's state media had reported that its Ambassador to Lebanon, Mojtaba Amani, was also wounded in Tuesday's explosions.</li>
	<li>The walkie-talkies which exploded on Wednesday, a source told Reuters, were purchased by Hezbollah five months ago, around the same time that the pagers were bought.</li>
	<li>United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said on Wednesday that civilian objects should not be weaponised. "I think it's very important that there is an effective control of civilian objects, not to weaponise civilian objects... that should be a rule that governments should, be able to implement," he said.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Mr Guterres also warned of a risk of serious escalation. "As important as the event in itself, is the indication that this event confirms that there is a serious risk of a dramatic escalation in Lebanon -- and everything must be done to avoid the escalation," he said.&nbsp;</li>

       <description><![CDATA[The mass pager attack against Hezbollah in Lebanon has turned the spotlight on Israel's secretive Unit 8200, the Israel Defense Forces' intelligence unit, which a Western security source said was involved in planning the operation.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The mass pager attack against Hezbollah in Lebanon has turned the spotlight on Israel's secretive Unit 8200, the Israel Defense Forces' intelligence unit, which a Western security source said was involved in planning the operation.</p>

<p>Israeli officials have remained silent on the audacious intelligence operation that killed 12 people on Tuesday and wounded thousands of Hezbollah operatives. At least one person was killed on Wednesday when hand-held radios used by Hezbollah detonated.</p>

<p>A senior Lebanese security source and another source told Reuters that Israel's Mossad spy agency was responsible for a sophisticated operation to plant a small quantity of explosives inside 5,000 pagers ordered by Hezbollah.</p>

<p>One Western security source told Reuters that Unit 8200, a military unit that is not part of the spy agency, was involved in the development stage of the operation against Hezbollah which was over a year in the making.</p>

<p>The source said Unit 8200 was involved in the technical side of testing how they could insert explosive material within the manufacturing process.</p>

<p>The Israeli military declined to comment. The prime minister's office which has oversight of Mossad did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>

<p>Yossi Kuperwasser, a former military intelligence official and now research director at the Israel Defense and Security Forum, said there was no confirmation that the military intelligence unit was involved in the attack.</p>

<p>But he said 8200's members were some of the best and brightest personnel in the Israeli military, serving in a unit at the centre of Israel's defence capabilities.</p>

<p>"The challenges they are facing are immense, very demanding, and we need the best people to get involved in that," he said.</p>

<p>The unit - and its legion of young, hand-picked soldiers - develops and operates intelligence gathering tools and is often likened to the U.S. National Security Agency.</p>

<p>In a rare public statement about the unit's activities, the IDF said in 2018 that it had helped to thwart an air attack by Islamic State on a Western country. At the time, it said the unit's operations ran from intelligence gathering and cyber defence to "technological attacks and strikes."</p>

<p>While Israel has never confirmed its involvement, Unit 8200 was reported to have been involved in the Stuxnet attack that disabled Iranian nuclear centrifuges as well as a series of other high-profile operations outside Israel.</p>

<p><strong>YOUNG RECRUITS</strong></p>

<p>The unit is effectively Israel's early warning system, and like much of the rest of the defence and security establishment, shouldered some of the blame for failing to detect Hamas' Oct. 7 assault on southern Israel.</p>

<p>Its commander last week said he was stepping down. In his resignation letter carried by Israeli media, he said he hadn't fulfilled his mission.</p>

<p>The unit is famous for a work culture that emphasizes out-of-the-box thinking to tackle issues previously not encountered or imagined. This helped some graduates build Israel's high-tech sector and some of its biggest companies.</p>

<p>"Whether it's a problem with software weakness, math, encryption, a problem hacking into something ... you must be capable of doing it on your own," said Avi Shua, a graduate of 8200, who went on to co-found Orca Security, a cloud security unicorn.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The unit has a high turnover rate of young recruits replacing veterans, said Kobi Samboursky, another former 8200 member and Managing Partner at Glilot Capital Partners, an early-stage fund investing in cybersecurity and artificial intelligence.</p>

<p>"The most significant thing here is the 'can-do' culture, where everything is possible," Samboursky said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on Wednesday said the kingdom would not recognise Israel without a Palestinian state and strongly condemned the "crimes of the Israeli occupation" against the Palestinian people.</p>

<p>"The kingdom will not stop its tireless work towards the establishment of an independent Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital, and we affirm that the kingdom will not establish diplomatic relations with Israel without that," the crown prince, known as MbS, said.</p>

<p>After the eruption of war last October between Israel and Palestinian group Hamas that rules Gaza, Saudi Arabia put on ice US-backed plans for the kingdom to normalise ties with Israel, two sources familiar with Riyadh's thinking said earlier this year, in a swift reordering of its diplomatic priorities.</p>

<p>MbS, Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler, had said just weeks before the fighting broke out that Riyadh was getting closer to a deal.</p>

<p>The two sources told Reuters there would be some delay in the US-backed talks on normalisation of Saudi-Israel ties, which is seen as a key step for the kingdom to secure what it considers the real prize of a US defence pact in exchange.</p>

<p>MbS made the remarks at an annual speech to the advisory Shura Council, which he gave on behalf of his father, King Salman.</p>

<p>The council swore an oath of office before MbS on Wednesday before he addressed it.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Dutch scientists from ASTRON are raising concerns about the second-generation Starlink satellites, claiming they cause significant interference with radio telescopes.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Elon Musk's new generation of Starlink satellites is raising concerns among Dutch scientists who claim the new satellites will bring fast internet worldwide and are proving to be interference for astronomers on a massive scale.</p>

<p>Thousands of orbiting Starlink satellites "are blinding" radio telescopes, perhaps causing damage to astronomical research, according to researchers at the Netherlands Institute for Radio Astronomy (<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.astron.nl/starlink-satellites/">ASTRON</a>). As these telescopes work on radio waves to examine the universe, it makes the collection of clean data much more complicated because of the interference caused by these satellites.</p>

<p>Starlink satellites connect remote areas with broadband internet, be it challenging conditions like in Ukraine and Yemen or the rural districts of the UK, for that matter. The Department for Digital, Culture, Media, and Sport reported how tests conducted in 2022 showed that Starlink could deliver internet speeds four times faster than the average.</p>

<p><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OIqLn152th8?si=4kYTvvqh5rdDXDz6" title="YouTube video player" width="560"></iframe></p>

<p>Scientists argue, however, that such privilege comes at an appreciable cost in terms of research.</p>

<p>"With LOFAR (Low Frequency Array), we have started a program to monitor unintended emission from satellites belonging to different constellations, and our observations show that the second-generation Starlink satellites emit stronger emission and do so over a larger range of radio frequencies, compared to the first-generation satellites," <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.astron.nl/starlink-satellites/">says Cees Bassa</a> from ASTRON (the Netherlands Institute for Radio Astronomy), the lead author of the study.</p>

<p>According to a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.astron.nl/starlink-satellites/"><em>release by ASTRON,</em></a> the analysis revealed that these newer satellites emit up to 32 times brighter unintended radio waves compared to the first generation, with levels potentially exceeding internationally regulated thresholds for interference set for intentional emissions and even more relaxed terrestrial electromagnetic compatibility standards.</p>

<p>"Compared to the faintest astrophysical sources that we observe with LOFAR, UEMR from Starlink satellites is 10 million times brighter. This difference is similar to the faintest stars visible to the naked eye and the brightness of the full moon. Since SpaceX is launching about 40 second-generation Starlink satellites every week, this problem is becoming increasingly worse," adds Cees Bassa."</p>

<p>"Humanity is clearly approaching an inflexion point where we need to take action to preserve our sky as a window to explore the universe from Earth. Satellite companies are not interested in producing this unintended radiation, so minimising it should also be a priority in their sustainable space policies," says Federico Di Vruno from the SKA Observatory. "Starlink is not the only big player in LEO, but they have a chance to set the standard here," he continues.</p>

<p>The researchers emphasise that while the second-generation satellites have been designed to enhance connectivity and provide communication services, the unintended radio emissions are a growing threat to the integrity of astronomical observations. As the consequences of such interference become increasingly evident, collaboration between satellite companies, regulatory agencies, and the astronomical community is essential to devise effective mitigation strategies.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Walkie talkies used by Lebanon's Hezbollah members exploded in the group's Beirut stronghold, with a video circulating on social media showing the chaos that unfolded during the explosion, Reuters reported quoting a source close to the group.</p>

<p>One of the explosions occurred during a funeral procession of a Hezbollah member who was killed yesterday in the pager blast. People can be seen scrambling for safety after a device detonated.</p>

<p>How many devices blew up is not known yet. There have been reports of landline telephones exploding too at various locations in East Lebanon.</p>

<p>This comes a day after pagers exploded across the country, killing nine people and injuring more than 2,800 others, Lebanese Health Minister Firass Abiad confirmed.</p>

<p>Iran's state media also reported that its Ambassador to Lebanon, Mojtaba Amani, was also wounded in yesterday's pager incident.</p>

<p>The handheld wireless walkie talkies were bought at the same time as the pagers, as per reports.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nine people have died and more than 300 others wounded as walkie-talkies have blown up at Hezbollah strongholds across Lebanon. This comes a day after pagers exploded across the middle-eastern country, killing twelve people and injuring nearly 3,000 others.</p>

<p>How many walkie-talkies blew up are not know yet. There are reports that landline telephones exploded too at various locations in East Lebanon.</p>

<p>According to reports, the hand-held wireless radio devices and walkie-talkies were bought around five months ago, approximately the same time as the pagers.</p>

<p>Today's blasts happened across southern Lebanon as well as Beirut's suburbs. At least one of the blasts happened near a funeral organised by Hezbollah for a member who was killed in yesterday's pager blasts. A <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/video-shows-explosion-at-funeral-of-hezbollah-member-killed-in-pager-blast-6595590" target="_blank">video of the incident</a> was widely circulated on social media platforms.</p>

<p>Iran-backed Hezbollah said today that it attacked Israeli artillery positions with rockets in the first strike at its arch-rival since pager blasts wounded thousands of its members in Lebanon and raised the prospect of a wider Middle East war.</p>

<p>Israel's spy agency Mossad, which has a long history of sophisticated operations on foreign soil, planted explosives inside pagers imported by Hezbollah months before Tuesday's detonations, a senior Lebanese security source and another source told news agency Reuters.</p>

<p>This morning Lebanese Health Minister Firass Abiad confirmed that twelve people were killed and around 2,800 wounded in the incident.</p>

<p>The minister, in a televised press conference, said the blasts "killed twelve people, including a girl", adding that "About 2,800 people were injured and more than 200 of them critically". The injuries were mostly on the face, hands and stomach, he had said.</p>

<p>Iran's state media had reported that its Ambassador to Lebanon, Mojtaba Amani, was also wounded in yesterday's pager incident.</p>

<p>Hezbollah, which is banned both by the United States and the European Union is the political and military establishment in Lebanon and is backed by Iran. Hezbollah backs Hamas, which has been at war with Israel in Gaza since October 2023.</p>

<p>Hezbollah had on Tuesday blamed Israel for the attack and has claimed that this is the "biggest security breach" it has faced yet.</p>

<p>Just like the pagers, all the walkie-talkie devices also exploded at the same time, Hezbollah has claimed.</p>

<p>Hezbollah had called the blasts an "Israeli breach" of its communications network, and has vowed to avenge the attack. Hezbollah also said it will continue to support Hamas in Gaza and that Israel should wait for a response for the "massacre".</p>

<h2><strong>WHO MADE THESE DEVICES?</strong></h2>

<p>Initial reports suggested that the pagers were made by a Taiwanese company, but the firm has denied this. The Taiwanese pager manufacturer - Gold Apollo - said that the devices were made under a licence by a company called BAC, which is situated in Budapest, the capital city of Hungary.</p>

<p>Though Israel has not commented on the blasts, it had said that it is widening the spectrum of its war with Hamas in Gaza to include its fight against its ally Hezbollah. Israel had made this statement hours before the blasts on Tuesday,</p>

<h3><strong>HEZBOLLAH RESPONSE</strong></h3>

<p>Calling it as a "massacre" and "criminal aggression", Hezbollah said Israel is "fully responsible" for these attacks.</p>

<p>Hezbollah, Iran's most powerful proxy in the Middle East, said in a statement it would continue to support Hamas in Gaza and Israel should await a response to the pager "massacre" which left fighters and others bloodied, hospitalised or dead.</p>

<p>Speaking further on the issue, Hezbollah said cross-border firing with Israeli forces have been "ongoing and separate from the difficult reckoning that the criminal enemy must await for its massacre."</p>

       <description><![CDATA[The dog suddenly bolted out of a building, causing Yan to step back and injure her back.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Shanghai court has ordered a dog owner to pay 90,000 yuan (Rs 10,64,011) in compensation to a pregnant woman who suffered a miscarriage after his unleashed golden retriever startled her. The woman, surnamed Yan, had undergone multiple IVF surgeries over three years to conceive. According to the <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scmp.com/news/people-culture/article/3278716/china-dog-owner-pays-woman-us12600-after-she-has-miscarriage-because-animal-startled-her">South China Morning Post,</a></em> the incident happened when Yan, 41, was walking through her residential community to collect a package. The dog suddenly bolted out of a building, causing Yan to step back and injure her back. She immediately felt discomfort in her waist and lower abdomen.</p>

<p>Later that day, Yan visited the hospital and was kept overnight. The next morning, doctors couldn't detect a fetal heartbeat.</p>

<p>''I've been pregnant for nearly four months. After the dog frightened me, I felt pain in my belly. I went to the hospital, but sadly my baby could not be saved. It's really hard for me to have this baby. I've had IVF treatment for three years. Now I have miscarried. I am heartbroken,” she said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>She filed a lawsuit against the dog's owner, Li, who acknowledged his dog was unleashed but claimed it was an assistance animal and wouldn't harm anyone. He also suggested she should have been more cautious given her pregnancy's high-risk nature due to IVF.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, the court ruled in Yan's favour, citing China's Animal Epidemic Prevention Law, which requires dogs to be leashed in public areas. The court determined that Yan's miscarriage resulted from being frightened by Li's unleashed dog.</p>

<p>The case has sparked a heated online debate, with 110 million views on Weibo. Many internet users expressed sympathy for the woman, while others&nbsp;debated about the issue of dogs not being leashed in public spaces.</p>

<p>One user said, ''It astounded me that this pet owner remained indifferent when seeing his dog jump on a pregnant woman.'' Another commented, ''Poor woman. It will be difficult for her to get pregnant again.''</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iran-backed Hezbollah said on Wednesday it attacked Israeli artillery positions with rockets in the first strike at its arch-foe since pager blasts wounded thousands of its members in Lebanon and raised the prospect of a wider Middle East war.</p>

<p>Israel's spy agency Mossad, which has a long history of sophisticated operations on foreign soil, planted explosives inside pagers imported by Hezbollah months before Tuesday's detonations, a senior Lebanese security source and another source told Reuters.</p>

<p>The deaths rose to 12, including two children, Lebanese Health Minister Firass Abiad said on Wednesday. Tuesday's attack wounded nearly 3,000 people, including many of the group's fighters and Iran's envoy to Beirut.</p>

<p>A Taiwanese pager maker denied that it had produced the pager devices which exploded in an audacious attack that raised the prospect of a full-scale war between the Iran-backed Hezbollah and Israel.</p>

<p>Gold Apollo said the devices were made by under licence by a company called BAC, based in Hungary's capital Budapest.</p>

<p>There was no immediate word on when Hezbollah had launched its latest rocket attack, but normally the group announces such strikes shortly after carrying them out, suggesting it fired at the Israeli artillery positions on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Hezbollah has vowed to retaliate against Israel, whose military declined to comment on the blasts. The two sides have been engaged in cross-border warfare since the Gaza conflict erupted last October, fuelling fears of a wider Middle East conflict that could drag in the United States and Iran.</p>

<p>Jordan's Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi accused Israel of pushing the Middle East to the brink of a regional war by orchestrating a dangerous escalation on many fronts.</p>

<p>"Hezbollah wants to avoid an all-out war. It still wants to avoid one. But given the scale, the impact on families, on civilians, there will be pressure for a stronger response," said Mohanad Hage Ali of the Carnegie Middle East Center.</p>

<p>Hezbollah, Iran's most powerful proxy in the Middle East, said in a statement it would continue to support Hamas in Gaza and Israel should await a response to the pager "massacre" which left fighters and others bloodied, hospitalised or dead.</p>

<p>One Hezbollah official said the detonation was the group's "biggest security breach" in its history.</p>

<p>Footage from hospitals reviewed by Reuters showed men with various injuries, some to the face, some with missing fingers and gaping wounds at the hip where the pagers were likely worn.</p>

<p>The plot appears to have been many months in the making, several sources told Reuters. It followed a series of assassinations of Hezbollah and Hamas commanders and leaders blamed on Israel since the start of the Gaza war.</p>

<p><strong>TRAIL LEADS TO BUDAPEST</strong></p>

<p>The senior Lebanese security source said the group had ordered 5,000 pagers from Gold Apollo, which several sources say were brought into the country earlier this year.</p>

<p>Gold Apollo founder Hsu Ching-Kuang said the pagers used in the explosion were made by a company in Europe that Gold Apollo named in a statement as BAC.</p>

<p>"The product was not ours. It was only that it had our brand on it," Hsu told reporters at the company's offices in the northern Taiwanese city of New Taipei on Wednesday.</p>

<p>The stated address for BAC Consulting in Hungary's capital Budapest was a peach building on a mostly residential street in an outer suburb. The company name was posted on the glass door on an A4 sheet.</p>

<p>A person at the building who asked not to be named said BAC Consulting was registered there but did not have a physical presence. The CEO of BAC Consulting, Cristiana Barsony-Arcidiacono says on her LinkedIn profile that she has worked as an adviser for various organisations including UNESCO. She did not respond to emails from Reuters.</p>

<p>BAC's registered activities are wide ranging, from computer game publishing to IT consulting to crude oil extraction.</p>

<p>The senior Lebanese security source identified a photograph of the model of the pager, an AR-924. Hezbollah fighters have been using pagers as a low-tech means of communication in an attempt to evade Israeli location-tracking.</p>

<p>The senior Lebanese source said the devices had been modified by Israel's spy service "at the production level." Israeli officials did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment.</p>

<p>"The Mossad injected a board inside of the device that has explosive material that receives a code. It's very hard to detect it through any means," the source said.</p>

<p>The source said about 3,000 of the pagers exploded when a coded message was sent to them, simultaneously activating the explosives.</p>

<p>Another security source told Reuters that up to three grams of explosives were hidden in the new pagers and had gone "undetected" by Hezbollah for months.</p>

<p>In a televised speech on Feb. 13, the group's Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah sternly warned supporters that their phones were more dangerous than Israeli spies, saying they should break, bury or lock them in an iron box.</p>

<p>Instead, Hezbollah opted to distribute pagers to its members across the group's various branches - from fighters to medics working in its relief services.</p>

<p>Israel's Mossad has gained notoriety for its complex operations stretching back to the daring 1960 abduction of high-ranking Nazi Adolf Eichmann. More recently, the spy agency has been blamed for cyber attacks and the assassination of a top Iranian scientist in 2020 with a remote-controlled machinegun.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two months after Donald Trump narrowly survived an assassination attempt, a gunman hid undetected for nearly 12 hours on the edge of the golf course where Trump played on Sunday under the protection of an agency that is being pushed to its limits.</p>

<p>As the 2024 presidential election enters its final stretch, the US Secret Service is operating with about 400 fewer employees than Congress has authorized, government records show.</p>

<p>The problem is not likely to be fixed before the Nov. 5 election, as the agency typically takes more than 200 days to fill open positions.</p>

<p>Since President Joe Biden ended his re-election bid in July and Vice President Kamala Harris took over as the Democratic presidential candidate in a tight race against the Republican Trump, the Secret Service has had to expand its protective coverage to a wider group of officials.</p>

<p>That has placed unprecedented strains on the agency, according to interviews with three former Secret Service agents and a former head of the department that oversees it.</p>

<p>"The pace, the expectations, the pressure has never been worse than it is right now," Kenneth Valentine, a former agent, said in a phone interview.</p>

<p>Trump's desire to golf, in private, at one of his Florida clubs on Sunday also meant that agents did not perform the sort of routine site survey that might have led them to find the alleged gunman before Trump came within a few hundred yards of where the man had holed up for hours, with food, near the fifth hole of the Trump International golf course.</p>

<p>Acting Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe - who stepped into his role in July when the agency's former leader resigned after Trump narrowly survived the first assassination attempt - says his agents are already working at high levels of stress.</p>

<p>"We are redlining them," Rowe said at a news conference on Monday.</p>

<p>Democrats and Republicans in Congress say they could sign off on additional funding in the coming weeks. But that will do little in the short term to fix a personnel shortage that forces agents to work long hours in pressure-filled situations.</p>

<p>The risk of failure was made clear on July 13, when a gunman fired six shots from atop a building at a Trump rally in Pennsylvania, killing a rallygoer and grazing the Republican candidate's ear.</p>

<p>Secret Service agents quickly hustled Trump to safety and killed the gunman, but agency leaders acknowledge he should have never been able to fire shots in the first place.</p>

<p><strong>AGENCY 'ASHAMED'</strong></p>

<p>Rowe told lawmakers on July 30 that he was "ashamed" of security lapses in the incident.</p>

<p>On Sunday, a Secret Service agent spotted the suspected gunman at the Florida golf course, glimpsing the muzzle of his AK-47-style rifle. The agent opened fire, driving him away before he had a direct line of sight to Trump or could fire a shot.</p>

<p>The suspect, Ryan Routh, was apprehended shortly after.</p>

<p>Still, security experts question why the agency did not find him sooner.</p>

<p>"How was Routh not spotted by an advance team? Did the (Secret Service) use a drone over the golf course? Dogs? If not, why not?" said Lora Ries, who oversaw the Secret Service as a top official at the US Department of Homeland Security during Trump's administration.</p>

<p>Rowe told reporters that Trump's Sunday golf outing was not announced to the public. That meant that the agency did not mount an intense security sweep beforehand, which could have signaled his imminent arrival.</p>

<p>Trump's penchant for playing golf on his own courses, which are open to members, creates greater security challenges than past presidents like Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, who typically played on military courses that could be closed to the public, former agents say.</p>

<p>Trump said Monday he wants more agents protecting him. As a candidate and former president, he is afforded fewer agents and resources than a sitting president.</p>

<p><strong>STAFFING SHORTFALL</strong></p>

<p>The Secret Service employed 7,879 people as of February, the most recent figures available.</p>

<p>That trails a plan that a previous agency director, James Murray, laid out to Congress in 2022, when he said he aimed to have 8,305 staffers within a year and 10,000 by 2027.</p>

<p>Though Congress boosted the Secret Service's budget by 9% this year to account for the 2024 election, the agency cannot quickly staff up. The demanding nature of the job means that only 2% of applicants typically are hired, Rowe told Congress in July.</p>

<p>The agency also has struggled in recent years to retain agents lured by more lucrative private-sector work, he said.</p>

<p>That shortage makes it more difficult for agents to remain on the job, as they must rush from one assignment to another.</p>

<p>"The Secret Service does not have the resources, it doesn't have the bodies," said former agent Bill Gage in an interview.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A shocking dashcam video has been released showing an 8-year-old girl driving her mother's vehicle,&nbsp; to a Target store in Ohio, US. Bedford police reported that the child, initially declared missing, was found safe and shopping at the store after driving for nearly 30 minutes on busy roads. According to <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://fox8.com/news/8-year-old-girl-found-driving-to-local-target-police/">Fox 8,&nbsp;</a></em>the incident happened on Sunday morning when the&nbsp;police received a call about the missing child, followed by a report of a small child driving a 2020 Nissan Rogue erratically on Rockside road.&nbsp;A dashcam video captured the shocking moment the young driver was spotted on the road. As the recording began, a man's voice was heard alerting authorities to a vehicle behind him, saying, "The car behind me is swerving everywhere."</p>

<p>A neighbour also provided crucial evidence to authorities, revealing that their home security camera captured the 8-year-old girl getting into the SUV alone and driving away.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Police traced the vehicle to a Target parking lot in Bainbridge, where they found the child shopping inside. The girl admitted to striking a mailbox during her 10-mile journey, estimated to be around 20-25 minutes via Google Maps.&nbsp;Her relatives were called to the store to get her and the vehicle.</p>

<p>Though no one was hurt, the incident raises concerns about child supervision and road safety. Authorities have not released information on the mother's whereabouts or potential charges.</p>

<p>Police told Nexstar's&nbsp;<a href="https://fox8.com/tag/i-team/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">FOX 8 I-Team</a>&nbsp;the girl is too young to be charged criminally, and they are grateful no one was injured. On <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.facebook.com/bedford.police.1/posts/pfbid0jSv2ZjWEP9Duiamzhda4EkYsLSyzBQDBuQA6nw5bGvMsuEUw8gacHh8DU6QSmdJKl?ref=embed_POST">Facebook</a>, the Bedford Police Department joked about the incident.&nbsp;</p>

<p>''Well, I've finally found a woman who's in more of a hurry to shop at Target than my wife. More of a hurry by 8 years. That's right an 8-year-old took mommy's car this morning and drove to Target in Bainbridge to shop. Thankfully she made it and was immediately located by Bainbridge Police. She's now home safe. Not sure what she bought, or if she was even able to use her Target app to save 5%. We did let her finish her Frappuccino. We're not mean,'' the post read.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The worst drought on record has lowered the water level of the rivers in the Amazon basin to historic lows, in some cases drying up riverbeds that were previously navigable waterways.</p>

<p>The Solimoes, one of the main tributaries of the mighty Amazon River whose waters originate in the Peruvian Andes, has fallen to its lowest level on record in Tabatinga, the Brazilian town on the border with Colombia.</p>

<p>Downriver in Tefe, a branch of the Solimoes has dried up completely, as seen by Reuters reporters who flew over the river on Sunday.</p>

<p>The nearby Lake Tefe, where more than 200 freshwater dolphins died in last year's drought, has also dried up, depriving the endangered pink mammals of a favorite habitat.</p>

<p>"We are going through a critical year," said Greenpeace spokesperson Romulo Batista, pointing to where the riverbed of the branch of the Solimoes had turned to mounds of sand. "This year, several months have broken last year's records."</p>

</div>

<p>The second-consecutive year of critical drought has parched much of Brazil's vegetation and caused wildfires across South American nations, cloaking cities in clouds of smoke.</p>

<p>"Climate change is no longer something to worry about in the future, 10 or 20 years from now. It's here and it's here with much more force than we expected," Batista added.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Indian-American billionaire Jay Chaudhry, co-founder and CEO of Zscaler, believes that passion is the essential trait for success in business.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Indian-American billionaire and co-founder of cybersecurity giant Zscaler, Jay Chaudhry, believes that passion for your work is one trait that can provide ultimate success in any business, according to a report by <em>CNBC. </em>The 66-year-old businessman, who launched his first entrepreneurial venture even back in 1996 by cofounding SecureIT with his wife, sold it in an all-stock deal two years later for $70 million. Since then, Chaudhry has founded three more companies-AirDefense, CipherTrust, and CoreHarbor-all of which he eventually sold.</p>

<p>In 2008, he started Zscaler, which he currently serves as the company's CEO. To Thursday, Zscaler's market capitalisation is $25.31 billion, and <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/jay-chaudhry/"><em>Forbes</em></a> puts Chaudhry's wealth at $9.5 billion.</p>

<p>In a recent interview with <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/16/the-no-1-trait-for-success-according-to-billionaire-jay-chaudhry.html"><em>CNBC,</em></a> Jay Chaudhry, an entrepreneur with a notable track record of success, emphasised that the key trait for achieving success is passion. He specifically highlighted the importance of having a "passion to achieve something meaningful."</p>

<p>"When you strongly or deeply have a passion for something, you'd do that so much that work becomes your hobby because you are enjoying it," Chaudhry said, adding that motivation leads to harder work and better results.</p>

<p>In contrast, he also mentions here that a lack of passion can undermine success even with experience. "If people don't have passion, it doesn't matter how much experience they have," he said. Without that inner drive, employees would not want to drive enthusiasm to tackle the challenges; therefore, work becomes less enjoyable.</p>

<p>While recruiting, Chaudhry evaluates candidates by their research work and the type of question they raise to measure their passion. As he believed, one's interest can foster them to deliver more in the workplace. In the end, he says, "Success drives success," as passion is an ultimate energy to propel a person to realise business objectives.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[While his sentencing remains pending, the incident has ignited a national conversation in Japan.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a strange incident in Japan, a man was arrested for making over 100 silent phone calls daily to his wife for several weeks. The disturbing event unfolded between July and August, captivating public attention due to the husband's bizarre behaviour.&nbsp;According to the <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scmp.com/news/people-culture/article/3278699/japan-wife-discovers-jealous-husband-made-100-nuisance-calls-day-entire-month">South China Morning Post</a></em>, a 31-year-old woman from Hyogo prefecture reported to police that she received unsettling blank calls every day in July and August. However, upon answering, the caller remained silent. Initially, she brought her concerns to her husband, but his nonchalance and lack of concern frustrated her.</p>

<p>A turning point came when she observed the calls stopped when her husband was asleep, gaming, or spending time with her. Her suspicion was piqued, and she devised a test. While shopping together, she closely monitored his actions, noticing he didn't touch his phone, and that's when the calls stopped.</p>

<p>She then reported her concerns to the police, who investigated the couple's phone records.&nbsp;Investigations revealed that the husband was indeed the mastermind behind the mysterious silent calls, leaving his wife distressed. Further probe revealed that he had been using private numbers to conceal his identity.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The couple had no known relationship issues and appeared to live harmoniously. According to reports, his motives stemmed from jealousy and possessiveness. A specific incident in the past triggered his insecurity when he discovered his wife engaging in a conversation with another man. Feeling threatened, he began making silent calls as a form of punishment.&nbsp;However, he also claimed that he ''loved her so much.''</p>

<p>In Japan, causing significant emotional distress through nuisance phone calls is considered a criminal offence. Violators may face up to one year in prison or a fine of up to 1 million yen (US$7,000), and a prohibition order will be issued.</p>

<p>On September 4, authorities apprehended the husband, taking him into custody. While his sentencing remains pending, the incident has ignited a national conversation in Japan. Many called for greater awareness and action against emotional harassment and domestic abuse.&nbsp;</p>

<p>One user wrote, ''The husband's control over his wife is too much. This kind of love is suffocating.''</p>

<p>Another commented, ''Communication is the best way for a couple to resolve issues, not harassment or violence.''</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An Australian YouTuber has found herself in the middle of a social media storm after criticising Indian cuisine for its "dirt spices". Sydney Watson's remarks have drawn severe backlash, with users quickly jumping to defend the historical and cultural significance of Indian food.</p>

<p>The controversy began when an X user shared a post praising Indian cuisine, saying, "Indian food is the best on earth. Fight me." Accompanying the post was a colourful photo of various curries and rice. While the post was meant to celebrate Indian food, the conversation quickly took a different turn when Sydney Watson responded with, "It really, really isn't."</p>

<p>However, it was her follow-up comments that ignited outrage. Watson added, "If your food requires you to put dirt spices all over it in order for it to be palatable, your food is not good."</p>

<p>One could easily dismiss it as a spy film plot if it weren't so real: a highly sophisticated 'pager attack' purportedly by Israeli agencies has left dozens dead and opened a new front in the ongoing Gaza crisis. Nine people were reported killed and over 2,700, including civilians, were injured when a series of text pagers supposedly used by Hezbollah members exploded in various parts of the country. Iran's ambassador to Lebanon, Mojtaba Amani, was also injured in the explosions.</p>

<p>Reports suggest Israel had intercepted the group's supply chains and laced more than 5,000 of these devices with explosives. A Taiwanese company, Gold Apollo, has denied charges that it was the provider of the consignment. Earlier, in February, Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah had warned his group against the use of mobile phones.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>More Complexity To Deal With</strong></h2>

<p>Israel has not officially taken credit for the attack. However, the incident adds one more layer to an intricate and clandestine face-off between Israeli agencies and the Lebanese militia group as both try to avoid a full-scale confrontation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The intent behind such an audacious attack appears to be to inflict a psychological and strategic blow rather than a tactical one. The attack would be added to a not-too-long but notable list of Israeli operations in the recent past that have primarily been designed to highlight the state's intrusions within its enemy's infrastructure, whether political, military, or technological. Examples include the use of automated AI-assisted weapons to assassinate Iranian scientist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh on the outskirts of Tehran in 2021, the elimination of Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh in central Tehran a few months ago, and various other clandestine operations aimed at disrupting Iran's nuclear programme. The basic idea behind these operations, including ones now involving low-grade tech like pagers, is optics, to show that the Israeli state can target its detractors at the time and place of its choosing.</p>

<p>The cat-and-mouse game between Hezbollah and Israel has been on the brink of turning into a full conflict for months now. Recently, Israel flew fighter jets over Beirut just before a sermon by Nasrallah, to show force and awareness. It has also been on a mission to eliminate his immediate deputies, such as Fuad Shukr. Recent reports have once again suggested that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu may look to remove Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, who has criticised the way decisions have been taken on the war in Gaza. Despite the political fault lines within Israel on these issues - including the far too public discrepancies between civil and military leaderships - there is a consensus to target both Hamas and Hezbollah in order to secure long-term security narratives, which were deemed lost after the October 7 terror attack.</p>

<h2><strong>Will Iran Intervene?</strong></h2>

<p>As a critical part of the 'Axis of Resistance', Hezbollah, backed by Iran, remains strong compared to Hamas, which has seen its fighting strength deplete significantly in recent months. Also, in choosing not to join Hamas in the aftermath of the October 2023 attack in Israel, Hezbollah managed to buy some time. The reason for this approach could be attributed to two lines of thinking. First, direct aggression against Israel in the country's north would in all likelihood not only invite a response of Israeli air power but that of the US as well, causing mass casualties on the ground in Lebanon, for which Hezbollah would have to be answerable. Second, there seems to be a lack of clarity on whether Iran would directly intervene in support of the said axis. For instance, Tehran hasn't yet directly responded to the killing of Haniyeh.</p>

<p>Hezbollah thus seemingly prefers a more protracted response, causing nuisance and displacement in Israel's north instead of going for a traditional, full-scale border conflict that it very well will not be able to afford.</p>

<p>Simultaneously, the growing tensions between Israel and Hezbollah are threatening to jeopardise diplomatic tracks being promoted by the likes of the US to put a ceasefire in place. Israeli hostages remain under Hamas captivity in Gaza, and Israeli military operations in response are set to continue. Netanyahu has made no qualms in admitting that such warfare will prevail till Hamas is eliminated.</p>

<h2><strong>A Psychological Strike</strong></h2>

<p>Ultimately, both Hamas and Netanyahu have, in their own way, obstructed ceasefire efforts. A political settlement today will require a prolonged secession of hostilities. While Nasrallah claims that his group does not want total war, both sides are sliding towards tactical exchanges. But even these tactical attacks can very well lead to a broader conflict.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With the latest explosions, Hezbollah's 'low-tech' pager communication network has already been busted, making it harder for the group to operate, debate, and deploy forces. In the short term, if not tactically, Israel has been managing to secure at least psychological victories against Hezbollah and its ilk. In the long term, things remain as uncertain as before. It won't be surprising if the Gaza crisis and accompanying regional tensions spill well into 2025.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A large-scale Ukrainian drone attack on Russia triggered an earthquake-sized blast at a major arsenal in the Tver region on Wednesday, forcing the evacuation of a nearby town, war bloggers and some media reported.</p>

<p>Unverified video and images on social media showed a huge ball of flame blasting high into the night sky and multiple detonations thundering across a lake about 380 km (240 miles) west of Moscow.</p>

<p>NASA satellites picked up intense heat sources emanating from an area of about 14 square kilometres (5 square miles) at the site in the early hours and earthquake monitoring stations picked up what sensors thought was a small earthquake in the area.</p>

<p>"The enemy hit an ammunition depot in the area of Toropets," said Yuri Podolyaka, an Ukrainian-born, pro-Russian military blogger.</p>

<p>"Everything that can burn is already burning there (and exploding)."</p>

<p>There was no information about casualties.</p>

<p>Russian state media have in the past reported that a major arsenal for conventional weapons was located at the site of the blasts. State media, which is now subject to military censorship laws, was muted in its reporting on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Igor Rudenya, the governor of the Tver region, said that Ukrainian drones had been shot down, that a fire had broken out and that some residents were being evacuated. He did not say what was burning.</p>

<p>One woman told Reuters that members of her family had been evacuated from Toropets.</p>

<p>"A fire started with explosions," the woman said, giving only a first name, Irina.</p>

<p>A source in Ukraine's SBU state security service told Reuters the drone attack destroyed a warehouse storing missiles, guided bombs and artillery ammunition. There was no immediate comment from the Ukrainian government.</p>

<p>Russia and Ukraine each reported dozens of enemy drone attacks on their territory overnight, with Russian forces advancing in eastern Ukraine.</p>

<p><strong>MAJOR EXPLOSION</strong></p>

<p>The size of the main blast shown in the unverified social media video was consistent with 200-240 tons of high explosives detonating, according to George William Herbert of the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey in California.</p>

<p>A Toropets chatroom on the Russian social media site VK was flooded with messages of support from other parts of the country and offers of help to people fleeing the town.</p>

<p>Some people were asking whether buildings at specific addresses were still standing.</p>

<p>"People, does anyone know what's happened to Kudino village??? They told me nothing is left of our house," posted one woman.</p>

<p>Another woman replied: "It's horror there." Kudino is a village 4.5 km (2.8 miles) northeast of Toropets.</p>

<p>Some war bloggers questioned how drones could trigger such large explosions at what was thought to be a highly fortified facility.</p>

<p>According to an RIA state news agency report from 2018, Russia was building an arsenal for the storage of missiles, ammunition and explosives in Toropets, a 1,000-year-old town, which has a population of just over 11,000.</p>

<p>Dmitry Bulgakov, then a deputy defence minister, told RIA in 2018 that the facility could defend weapons from missiles and even a small nuclear attack. Bulgakov was arrested earlier this year on corruption charges. He denies the charges.</p>

<p>"It (the concrete facilities) ensures their reliable and safe storage, protects them from air and missile strikes and even from the damaging factors of a nuclear explosion," RIA quoted Bulgakov as saying at the time.</p>

<p>Some Russians on chat groups expressed anger.</p>

<p>"Why wasn't the ammunition underground?! What are you doing???? In Kudino, houses were blown away! Why is the forest burning and no one is there... what kind of negligence is this!!!!" one woman posted.</p>

<p>Russia reported that its air defence units had destroyed 54 drones launched against five Russian regions overnight, without mentioning Tver. Ukraine said it had shot down 46 of 52 drones launched by Moscow overnight and that Russia had used three guided air missiles which did not reach their targets.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lebanon witnessed a series of explosions on Tuesday after thousands of pagers, allegedly used by the militant group Hezbollah, <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/explained-how-pagers-turned-bombs-and-why-israel-is-being-blamed-6592100 ">detonated simultaneously across the country</a>. The coordinated blasts killed at least nine people and left over 3,000 injured.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The explosions occurred in various public places, with reports flooding in from grocery stores, street markets, and other busy locations. Video footage from a grocery store showed a man shopping when the pager attached to his waist suddenly exploded, throwing him to the ground. Bystanders fled in terror as chaos erupted around them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With pagers being outdated technology, attention has shifted to more modern devices like smartphones, which are widely used by billions worldwide. Could a similar malfunction happen with smartphones?</p>

<p>The notion of hackers turning smartphones into bombs is frightening but unlikely. Smartphone technology's complexity and safeguards minimise risks.</p>

<p>Hezbollah's use of pagers stemmed from security concerns. Simpler and less connected, pagers are harder to track and hack. However, reports suggest explosives may have been embedded in pagers. A New York Times report speculated that Israeli intelligence had inserted explosives into pagers ordered from a Taiwanese manufacturer, although the company denied the claims. If true, this suggests that the explosion was triggered remotely through advanced means.</p>

<p>When it comes to smartphones, they are more complex, with software systems and network connections. In theory, hackers could exploit vulnerabilities in smartphone firmware to cause overheating or malfunction, but mass-scale attacks would be far more difficult to execute compared to pagers. This is because smartphones have multiple security layers and safety measures to prevent battery overheating.</p>

<p>Modern smartphones are equipped with built-in safety mechanisms like temperature regulation circuits, which automatically cut off charging when the device overheats. Advanced cooling systems such as vapour chambers and graphite layers are also present, to ensure that any excess heat is dissipated.</p>

<p>As a result, while smartphones can occasionally malfunction and overheat, they rarely explode. In the rare cases where a smartphone catches fire, it is often due to physical damage or manufacturing defects rather than malicious interference.</p>

<p>Even if hackers could remotely manipulate a smartphone's battery to generate heat, the chances of causing a mass explosion are slim. In most instances, the phone would overheat and possibly swell, leak or catch a small fire, but an explosion on the scale of the Hezbollah pager incident is unlikely.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ukraine said Sunday it had struck a second key bridge in the Kursk region, seeking to disrupt Moscow's supply routes as Kyiv's unprecedented incursion on Russian soil stretched through its second week.</p>

<p>Russia meanwhile ramped up pressure in east Ukraine, claiming to capture another village just a few kilometres from the Ukrainian-held logistics hub of Pokrovsk.</p>

<p>"Minus one more bridge," Ukrainian Air Force Commander Mykola Oleshchuk said on Telegram, publishing an aerial video of a blast tearing through a bridge near the Russian town of Zvannoye.</p>

<p>"The Air Force aviation continues to deprive the enemy of logistical capabilities with precision air strikes," he said.</p>

<p>It was unclear when Ukraine carried out the attack. Oleshchuk did not give a date and Russian military bloggers shared photos of destruction from what appeared to be the same bridge dated Saturday.</p>

<p>Kyiv sent troops and armoured vehicles across the border on August 6, its biggest attack on Russian territory since the Kremlin launched its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.</p>

<p>On Friday, Ukraine announced it had destroyed a separate bridge in the neighbouring town of Glushkovo.</p>

<p>"Our guys are doing a great job in all areas," Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said of the Kursk region operations in his evening address Sunday.</p>

<p>The Kursk offensive, he added, was aimed at "creating a buffer zone on the aggressor's territory", confirming recent comments by senior Ukrainian officials.</p>

<p>But he repeated his appeal for faster delivery of key equipment, addressing Britain, France and the United States in particular.</p>

<h3><strong>Advancing to Pokrovsk</strong></h3>

<p>The attacks on both bridges, which lie on the river Seym that winds through Kursk, have left Russia with limited options to cross the river in the area, according to Russian military bloggers.</p>

<p>Moscow said the destruction of one of the bridges had hindered evacuation efforts.</p>

<p>The Russian defence ministry said in a briefing it was pushing back against Ukraine's forces near several villages.</p>

<p>More than 120,000 people have fled the region since fighting began, say Russian officials.</p>

<p>Russia's defence ministry said Sunday its forces had captured Svyrydonivka, another frontline settlement some 15 kilometres (nine miles) away from Pokrovsk.</p>

<p>Pokrovsk lies on the intersection of a key road that supplies Ukrainian troops and towns across the eastern front and has long been a target for the Russian army.</p>

<p>Russian forces have been inching towards Pokrovsk for months, taking a string of tiny villages as they seek to reach the outskirts of the city.</p>

<p>"There have been dozens of attacks in just one day," said Zelensky in his evening address. "But our units, our brigades are doing everything they can to maintain their positions."</p>

<p>The head of Pokrovsk's military administration, Sergiy Dobryak, warned earlier this week that Russia was a little more than 10 kilometres from the outskirts of the city and urged remaining residents to evacuate.</p>

<p>Earlier Sunday, Ukrainian forces said they had thwarted a Russian missile attack on the capital Kyiv where air raid sirens sounded before dawn.</p>

<p>No damage or casualties were reported from the attack, which the administration said likely involved "North Korean ballistic missiles of the KN-23 type".</p>

<h3><strong>'Falling debris'</strong></h3>

<p>Ukrainian drones attacked an oil storage facility in Russia's southern Rostov region early Sunday morning, sparking a large fire, the local governor said.</p>

<p>Videos published on social media showed thick black smoke and bursts of flames coming from the site of the blaze, which the governor said was in the town of Proletarsk.</p>

<p>"In the southeast of the Rostov region, air defences repelled a drone attack. As a result of falling debris on the territory of industrial storage facilities in Proletarsk, a diesel fuel fire broke out," Governor Vasily Golubev said on Telegram.</p>

<p>"At 05:35 (0235 GMT), firefighting at the industrial facility in Proletarsk was suspended due to a second drone attack," he added in an update to the post.</p>

<p>No one was injured and firefighting efforts resumed shortly after, he posted later.</p>

<p>A source in Ukraine's intelligence services said the installations were part of Russia's "military-industrial complex".</p>

<p>Proletarsk is some 250 kilometres from the Ukraine border and some 350 kilometres from Kyiv-held areas of fighting on the eastern Ukrainian front line.</p>

<p>Kyiv has repeatedly targeted oil and gas facilities in Russia since the conflict began, some hundreds of kilometres from its borders, what it calls "fair" retaliation for attacks on its energy infrastructure.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, Zelensky praised his forces for hitting oil facilities in Russia, saying the attacks would help bring a "just end" to the conflict.</p>

<p>Elsewhere, Ukrainian authorities in the region of Donetsk said four civilians were killed and as many injured by Russian air strikes.</p>

<p>And further south in Ukrainian-controlled parts of Kherson, a drone attack on a car injured five people, local investigators said on Telegram.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[New details have emerged in an ongoing probe into the relationship between Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder Imran Khan and former ISI Director-General Lieutenant General (retd) Faiz Hameed, as reported by The Express Tribune.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>New details have emerged in an ongoing probe into the relationship between Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder Imran Khan and former ISI Director-General Lieutenant General (retd) Faiz Hameed, as reported by The Express Tribune.</p>

<p>According to sources cited by The Express Tribune, General Hameed maintained contact with Imran Khan through his wife, Bushra Bibi. Hameed allegedly provided information to Bushra Bibi in advance, which she would then convey to Imran Khan, presenting it as divine inspiration.</p>

<p>When this information later proved to be accurate, it reportedly reinforced the PTI founder's belief in Bushra Bibi's spiritual abilities, while in reality, it was Mr Hameed who had shared the information.</p>

<p>The probe took an unexpected turn after the former ISI chief's arrest when an iPhone discovered in Chakwal reportedly unveiled details of his relationship with Imran Khan. According to sources, Bushra Bibi's patience is reportedly wearing thin, The Express Tribune noted.</p>

<p>There are indications that Imran Khan's wife might be considering cooperating with authorities, potentially testifying in exchange for immunity and distancing herself and her close associate, Farah Gogi, from the ongoing controversies.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, on Saturday, Imran Khan stated that he does not feel intimidated by the arrest of General Faiz Hameed, as reported by The Express Tribune.</p>

<p>Speaking informally with reporters in Adiala Jail, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder Imran Khan said that he would not have called for a judicial commission if he were afraid.</p>

<p>On August 12, Pakistan's military announced that General Hameed had been arrested due to "multiple instances of violation" of the Army Act following his retirement in December 2022, according to Geo News.</p>

<p>The military further stated, "The process of Field General Court Martial has been initiated, and Lt Gen (retd) Faiz Hameed has been taken into military custody."</p>

<p>The Pakistani military explained that the action against the former ISI chief was in line with the orders of the Supreme Court, which in 2023 called for an investigation after a land development company named Top City filed a petition, Geo News reported. The company alleged that Hameed and his brother had acquired ownership of several properties and had even blackmailed the company's owner.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Hamas on Sunday again accused Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of "obstructing an agreement" for a truce and hostage exchange in Gaza.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hamas on Sunday again accused Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of "obstructing an agreement" for a truce and hostage exchange in Gaza.</p>

<p>The Palestinian group said in a statement following the latest round of talks in Qatar that Netanyahu was "fully responsible for thwarting the efforts of the mediators, obstructing an agreement, and (bears) full responsibility for the lives" of hostages in Gaza.</p>

<p>Following two days of talks in Doha between US, Egyptian and Qatari mediators, the United States on Friday submitted a new compromise proposal.</p>

<p>According to Hamas, the proposal "responds to Netanyahu's conditions, especially his rejection of a permanent ceasefire and a comprehensive withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, and his insistence on continuing to occupy the Netzarim junction, the Rafah crossing and the Philadelphi corridor".</p>

<p>The latter two places are seen by Israel as important for preventing the flow of any weapons into the Gaza Strip, while the Netzarim junction sits at a strategic point between northern and southern Gaza.</p>

<p>Netanyahu "also set new conditions in the prisoner exchange file and retreated from other items, which prevents the completion of the exchange deal", Hamas said.</p>

<p>The Israeli premier had earlier denounced the group for being "obstinate" and not sending a delegation to the talks, saying Hamas not Israel should be under pressure.</p>

<p>He was speaking ahead of a visit by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who is pushing for a deal.</p>

<p>In its statement, Hamas reiterated its support for a proposal set out by US President Joe Biden in May, which he said was an Israeli plan.</p>

<p>That proposal involved a three-phase deal, starting with a six-week truce alongside the release of hostages taken on October 7 and an Israeli withdrawal from densely populated parts of Gaza.</p>

<p>Hamas officials have on several occasions accused Netanyahu of obstructing an agreement.</p>

<p>Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel that started the war resulted in the deaths of 1,198 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures.</p>

<p>Hamas also took 251 hostages, with 111 still held in Gaza, including 39 the Israeli military says are dead.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory offensive in the Gaza Strip has killed at least 40,099 people, according to data from the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory which does not provide a breakdown of civilian and Hamas casualties.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>People in large numbers participated in the India Day Parade held in New York, US. A carnival float featuring Ram Mandir was also part of the parade.</p>

<p>Patriotic songs were played as the people participated in the India Day Parade. People carried Indian flags and were seen playing dhols and dancing as they participated in the parade.</p>

<p>Religious songs were played as the float moved on the roads during the carnival. The float, made of wood, largely depicts the Ram Mandir -- a grand pink sandstone temple built for Lord Ram in the city of Ayodhya.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The whole structure of Ram Temple, which was made of wood, was decorated with flowers.</p>

— ANI (@ANI) <a href="https://twitter.com/ANI/status/1825242955860660486?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 18, 2024</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>The 18-foot long, nine-foot wide and eight-foot height float has largely been carved out in India and has been shipped by air cargo to participate in the parade.</p>

<p>The Ram Lalla idol was unveiled at the Pran Pratishtha ceremony after the hour-long rituals in the presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi who led the ceremony on January 22 in Uttar Pradesh's Ayodhya.</p>

<p>The parade marched down Madison Avenue from East 38th Street to East 27th Street in the city. In addition to the parade, there was also a festival with a stage for cultural performances and over 45 booths and food vendors.</p>

<p>According to the Federation of Indian Associations, the parade featured more than 40 floats, over 50 marching groups and over 30 marching bands, along with celebrities and dignitaries.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bollywood actress Sonakshi Sinha was the grand marshal, and the guests of honour included Indian actor Pankaj Tripathi and Member of Parliament Manoj Tiwari.</p>

<p>Speaking to ANI, Swami Avdheshanand Giri Ji Maharaj said, "I have come to New York to participate in the India Day Parade at the invitation of the Indian-American community. People are enthusiastic as they participate in the India Day Parade. Different tableaus featuring India's divine culture, our Kalajayi, Mrityunjaya, and Sanatan culture, and its values are seen here. All tableaus are very wonderful here."</p>

<p>"The tableau which has float of Ram Mandir, has gathered attraction. Ram Mandir's float showcases that India's culture considers the whole world as a family. It sees only one God in all the human beings. And our culture says that only one Brahma is all-encompassing....We Indians give the message of equality. We Indians consider the whole world as a family. We Indians pray for everyone's welfare. We are gathered here today....This is the biggest and largest parade in the world and showcases the whole of India," he added.</p>

<p>A group representing Indian American Muslims withdrew its float from the Parade following controversy over the inclusion of the Ram Mandir float they say shows anti-Muslim bias.</p>

<p>Just hours before the parade, the Federation of Indian Associations -- the group that is organising the event spoke exclusively to ANI and said that the float celebrates the inauguration of a landmark significant to Hindus.</p>

<p>Ankur Vaidya, Chairman of the Federation of Indian Associations, said the parade represents the country's diversity and will feature floats from various communities in India.</p>

<p>"It is a proud moment to be gathering here with members of our community. I have been volunteering here since 2008 and this year is special. It's because we're displaying a replica of the Ram Temple to march down Madison Avenue instilling the values of harmony and peace for all. We Hindus pray that all problems disappear by Lord Ram. This is a march for goodwill and peace for all," Mr Vaidya said.</p>

<p>Mr Vaidya added that the preparations for the march were in full swing.</p>

<p>"The New York Police Department and the Mayor have supported us in terms of the parade for the last 20 years. Avinash Gupta, the President of the FIA, the media, sponsors and participants have been a strong pillar of support in terms of what we have endured for something as innocent as trying to display a miniature version of our faith very peacefully and as law-abiding citizens. This is the 42nd parade in New York City, and is the oldest and the largest India Day parade in the US," he said.</p>

<p>Mr Vaidya urged all participants to be calm, peaceful and happy. "I urge all participants to be calm, peaceful and happy, positive and abide by all laws of New York City. Let's have a great parade and make our community, homeland of the US and motherland India proud," he said.</p>

<p>The India Day parade in NYC has been taking place every year for over four decades, to mark the celebration of India's independence. The four-decade-old annual celebration in NYC will celebrate the 42nd Annual India Day Parade on the busy streets of New York.</p>

<p>Several Indian Americans from different faiths shared their views with ANI about the situation, with some condemning the false narratives being spread on social media.</p>

<p>In a statement on August 14, the Federation of Indian Associations NY-NJ-CT-NE said, "We find ourselves under heavy scrutiny for organizing a peaceful community celebration that our dedicated volunteers have worked tirelessly to prepare. This malicious and hate-filled scrutiny, spread on social media, has resulted in the loss of sponsorships--the lifeblood of our event--and in fear-mongering, causing law-abiding citizens to worry about potential unruly conduct due to the hateful messages circulating online."</p>

<p>"Our inclusion of a float that celebrates the inauguration of a sacred landmark, significant to hundreds of millions of Hindus has been insulted by derogatory name calling and the officials and the mainstream is radio silent. I respectfully ask, would such name-calling be tolerated if directed at any other community's place of worship? The answer is unequivocally no," the statement further said.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kamala Harris embarked on a bus tour of the potentially election-deciding state of Pennsylvania on Sunday, as she keeps up the momentum before her star turn at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago.</p>

<p>The US vice president has reenergized the party after an astonishing month that has seen her replace President Joe Biden at the top of the ticket and wipe out Republican rival Donald Trump's lead in the polls.</p>

<p>Harris and her running mate Tim Walz, accompanied by their spouses, arrived at an airport hangar in Pittsburgh and greeted supporters, before setting off on a bus emblazoned with their names to a series of small towns to woo blue-collar voters.</p>

<p>Visiting a campaign phone bank later in Rochester, Pennsylvania, a crowd chanted "We are not going back" -- Harris's signature line as America's first female, Black and South Asian vice president casts herself as a new generation of leader.</p>

<p>Her rapid rise has unsettled 78-year-old former president and convicted felon Trump, who is resorting to his favored tactic of personal insults as he struggles to recalibrate a campaign that had focused largely on 81-year-old Biden's age.</p>

<p>A day earlier at a rally in Pennsylvania, Trump lashed out at Harris as a "lunatic" and bragged that he was "much better looking" than 59-year-old Harris.</p>

<p>The two campaigns are focusing heavily on Pennsylvania, in the heart of America's rust belt, which Trump won in 2016 before Biden seized it in 2020.</p>

<h3><strong>'We are ready'</strong></h3>

<p>Later in the day Harris will head to Chicago, where Democrats are daring to be hopeful again, just a few short weeks after a disastrous debate performance by Biden led many to think the election was already lost.</p>

<p>A Washington Post-ABC-Ipsos survey published Sunday showed Harris with a narrow lead over Trump among registered voters across the country, where one month ago it had Trump and Biden in a dead heat.</p>

<p>Security has been ramped up for the four-day Chicago convention, with tens of thousands of protesters expected to rally every day against the Biden-Harris administration's support for Israel's war on Hamas in Gaza.</p>

<p>The demonstrations are expected to begin on Sunday and continue through Thursday, with major gatherings scheduled for Monday and Wednesday in particular.</p>

<p>"We are ready," Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson told ABC on Sunday, adding that his police force was working with the Secret Service and other agencies to ensure a "safe, peaceful, yet vibrant" convention.</p>

<p>Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker said the planned protests would be allowed as long as they remained peaceful.</p>

<p>"If there are troublemakers, they are going to get arrested and they are going to get convicted," he told CNN.</p>

<h3><strong>Biden to pass torch</strong></h3>

<p>The Democratic bonanza in Chicago will allow Harris to tell her story to an American public that is still getting to know the candidate.</p>

<p>Harris is set to join Biden on stage when he addresses the convention on Monday -- a speech that just a few weeks ago he expected to be giving as the Democratic candidate.</p>

<p>The ageing president is reportedly still fuming over the way Democrats pushed him out, believing he still could have beaten Trump.</p>

<p>But Biden is expected to focus instead on passing the torch and on what he terms the threat to democracy posed by Trump, as he seeks to cement his legacy by helping Harris to victory.</p>

<p>Biden will "make the case for Vice President Kamala Harris" and "highlight the stakes of the election for all Americans," the Harris campaign said.</p>

<p>First Lady Jill Biden will also address the conference on Monday.</p>

<p>Former presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama will appear during the week, along with former secretary of state Hillary Clinton and former first lady Michelle Obama.</p>

<p>Taking the stage on Wednesday will be Harris's vice presidential pick Walz, the Minnesota governor who has made his name with attacks branding Trump and his running mate Vance as "weird."</p>

<p>While Democrats meet in Chicago, Trump will be crisscrossing the country, with rallies scheduled in the battleground states of Pennsylvania, Michigan, North Carolina and Arizona through the week.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>French film legend Alain Delon, a divisive star known to some as a sex symbol and to others as an egotistical chauvinist, has died aged 88, his children announced Sunday.</p>

<p>The actor, known for his roles in classics "Purple Noon" ("Plein Soleil", 1960) and "Le Samourai" (1967), died in the early hours of the morning, his son Anthony told AFP. He had been suffering from cancer.</p>

<p>"Alain Fabien, Anouchka, Anthony, as well as (his dog) Loubo, are deeply saddened to announce the passing of their father," Delon's children said in a statement to AFP.</p>

<p>"He passed away peacefully in his home in Douchy, surrounded by his three children and his family," said the statement, which came after months of public family feuding over the star's weakening health.</p>

<p>French President Emmanuel Macron called Delon a "French monument" who "played legendary roles and made the world dream".</p>

<p>Fellow 1960s star Brigitte Bardot told AFP he left "a huge void that nothing and no one will be able to fill".</p>

<p>Delon had millions of fans but also legions of critics, with feminists appalled by the lifetime achievement award the Cannes Film Festival gave him in 2019.</p>

<p>He lived his later years largely as a recluse, though his personal life kept him in the headlines.</p>

<p>In 2023, his three children filed a complaint against his live-in assistant Hiromi Rollin, accusing her of harassment and threatening behaviour.</p>

<p>The siblings went on to wage a public battle in the media and the courts, arguing over his state of health, which worsened after a stroke in 2019.</p>

<h3><strong>Instinctive genius</strong></h3>

<p>Far from a cerebral actor, Delon was considered an instinctive genius. He prided himself on never working on his technique, instead relying on charisma.</p>

<p>Former president of the Cannes festival, Gilles Jacob, paid tribute to Delon as "a lion, an actor with a steely gaze", while Alberto Barbera, director of the Venice film festival, said he was an "icon" who had climbed "to the Olympus of the immortals".</p>

<p>Delon's looks were cinematic gold for filmmakers in the 1960s, playing dark roles such as the manipulative anti-hero of "Purple Noon", adapted from the Patricia Highsmith thriller "The Talented Mr Ripley".</p>

<p>And in Jean-Pierre Melville's "Le Samourai", he set the template for one of Hollywood's main archetypes: the enigmatic, silent hitman.</p>

<p>Directors from Martin Scorsese, to John Woo and Quentin Tarantino acknowledge a debt to the inner life Delon gave his stylish killer -- although the French actor never managed to make it big in Hollywood.</p>

<p>"R.I.P to the angel-faced gangster," US director Jim Jarmusch posted on Instagram, with a photo of Delon from "Le Samourai".</p>

<p>Some of his best films were from his time in Italy, including two collaborations with Luchino Visconti, "Rocco and his Brothers" (1960) and "The Leopard" (1963).</p>

<p>"The party's over," his co-star in "The Leopard", Claudia Cardinale, said Sunday. "Tancredi has gone to dance with the stars," she added, using the name of his character.</p>

<p>Several Paris cinemas were showing "The Leopard" Sunday to full houses.</p>

<p>"Alain Delon really represents French cinema with a capital 'C'," 26-year-old cinemagoer Victor Roussel told AFP before going in for one showing.</p>

<p>Spanish actor Antonio Banderas, a screen idol a generation later, paid tribute with a post on X showing three photos of Delon in his prime and the words "Au revoir #AlainDelon. R.I.P."</p>

<h3><strong>Controversial views</strong></h3>

<p>Delon's relationship with women caused controversy. His sons accused him of domestic violence, and while Delon denied this, he admitted slapping women during quarrels.</p>

<p>Delon also drew criticism for supporting Jean-Marie Le Pen, leader of the far-right National Front, who was in favour of the death penalty and spoke against same-sex relationships.</p>

<p>He had a series of tumultuous affairs, describing German actor Romy Schneider as the "love of my life" after their relationship in the 1960s.</p>

<p>German-born Velvet Underground singer Nico claimed he was the father of her son, Christian Aaron Boulogne -- something Delon continually denied up to Boulogne's death in 2023 from a heroin overdose.</p>

<p>Delon married Francine Canovas, known as Nathalie Delon, in 1964, a stormy relationship that ended in divorce in 1969. Other high-profile relationships including pop diva Dalida and model-turned-actor Mireille Darc.</p>

<p>His death put him back on frontpages Sunday, including in Italy where he spent much of his career in the 1950s and 60s.</p>

<p>La Repubblica bid "adieu to the myth of French cinema".</p>

<p>Il Corriere della Sera lamented that "there will never be another actor like Delon", while Switzerland's newspaper Le Temps called him "a true badass with an angel's face".</p>

<h3><strong>Fans gather</strong></h3>

<p>Delon made his last major public appearance on the red carpet to receive an honorary Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival in May 2019.</p>

<p>"It's a bit of a posthumous tribute, but from my lifetime," he said when receiving the award.</p>

<p>Delon lived out his final years at home in a small village in France, surrounded by high walls, where he planned to be buried not far from his dogs.</p>

<p>Outside the entrance to his home in Douchy-Montcorbon, dozens of fans placed flowers and gathered to pay their respects.</p>

<p>"It's a part of our youth that is gone, it's very sad," said Marie Arnold, laying white flowers with her sister Michele.</p>

<p>"Alain is in a deep, chosen solitude, in another world, in the past with people he very much loved," his former partner Darc told AFP in 2015.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of 5.1 struck off the Japanese prefecture of Ibaraki, just northeast of Tokyo, the country's weather agency said.</p>

<p>The temblor occurred on Monday at 0:50 a.m. local time, measuring lower 5 on the Japanese seismic intensity scale of 7, said the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA).</p>

<p>The epicentre was located at a depth of 10 km at a latitude of 36.7 degrees north and a longitude of 140.6 degrees east, Xinhua news agency reported.</p>

<p>Tremors were also felt in central Tokyo, with no tsunami warning issued following the quake.</p>

<p>Japan had recently issued a warning about a potential "megaquake", however, a week later, it lifted the advisory. The alert followed a magnitude 7.1 quake that struck the southern part of the country on August 8.</p>

<p>It advised people to be alert but not evacuate, saying the probability of a major earthquake was higher than usual but it was not imminent.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the five weeks since U.S President Joe Biden abandoned his flailing reelection bid, the Democratic Party's fortunes have changed dramatically, and this week the change will be on full display.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Vice President Kamala Harris, now the party's candidate, is heading into the Democratic National Convention riding a historic whirlwind: her campaign has broken records for fundraising, packed arenas with supporters, and turned the polls in some battleground states in Democrats' favour.</p>

<p>Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz - have turned "joy" into a campaign buzz word, a pithy reminder of the despair the party felt just weeks ago. The two publicly accept their party's nomination at the convention in Chicago that starts Monday.</p>

<p>"This has been an historic transformation," said Joseph Foster, a 71-year-old former Democratic Party chairman in the Philadelphia suburbs who remains active in the party. "People are enthused, young people are engaged. I have never seen anything like it."</p>

<p>With less than 80 days to go to Election Day, the party is hoping to ride that wave of enthusiasm to victory.</p>

<p>That would make Harris, the first Black person and person of Asian descent to serve as vice president, the nation's first female president.</p>

<p>But pollsters and strategists from both major parties warn that the "sugar high" of Harris' initial surge will wear off, leaving simmering divisions among Democrats on issues like the economy and Israel-Hamas war along with a fierce battle against Republican candidate Donald Trump.</p>

<p>Harris' historic personal story is "lovely and fine, but it's the issues that are going to ultimately decide this election. Those issues include inflation, security, leadership and the world stage," Republican pollster Adam Geller predicted.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Harris had her first major economy-focused speech on Friday and laid out proposals to cut taxes for most Americans, ban "price gouging" by grocers and boost affordable housing, an early nod to the party's progressive flank.</p>

<p>She will face increased public pressure to provide more details on policy in the upcoming weeks. Aides have signaled that she is unlikely to provide many specifics in some areas like energy to avoid alienating the moderate and progressive wings of her party.</p>

<p>Harris may also have to navigate intra-party squabbles over U.S. support for Israel's war against Hamas and familiar divisions between progressives and moderates on a host of policy questions such as energy, healthcare and immigration.</p>

<p>About 200 social justice organizations plan to march at the Democratic National Convention on Monday to protest the Biden administration's continued support of Israel in a war that has killed more than 40,000 Palestinians in Gaza.</p>

<h3><strong>New Map To Victory</strong></h3>

<p>Harris, who will address the convention on Thursday, enters the week of festivities boosted by a string of polls that show she has already redrawn an electoral map that strongly favored Trump in the final weeks of Biden's candidacy.</p>

<p>Harris is leading or tied with Trump in six of seven swing states that are expected to decide the Nov. 5 election, according to the latest report issued Wednesday from the nonpartisan Cook Political Report.</p>

<p>The election handicapper shifted its ratings for the swing states of Arizona, Georgia and Nevada toward Harris after it had moved all three states to "lean Republican" in early July when Biden was still the Democratic candidate.</p>

<p>"I think what we have is a reset race where the Democratic candidate now has reenergized, or at least reconstituted, the Biden 2020 coalition, not completely, but it's much more put together than it was when Biden was on the top of the ticket," Amy Walter, Cook's editor, said in a call detailing the poll's findings.</p>

<p>Biden won the White House in 2020 with the strong backing of Black, Hispanic and young American voters, but their enthusiasm for him this time around was sharply lower.</p>

<p>He finally stepped aside on July 21, under pressure from longtime allies and senior Democratic leaders amid growing concerns about his mental acuity and chances of beating Trump. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Biden endorsed Harris and she quickly won the party's support. The change rapidly reframed the race, giving Democrats a boost and forcing Trump's campaign team to scramble in search of a new battle plan. &nbsp;</p>

<p>A Monmouth University poll released Wednesday found a substantial jump in enthusiasm among registered Democratic voters and a sizeable one among independents.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In June, only 46% of registered Democrats said they were fired up about a Biden-Trump rematch -- that jumped to 85% in the latest Monmouth survey conducted earlier this month.</p>

<p>The jump in enthusiasm among independents went from 34% in June to 53% in the latest poll.</p>

<p>Still, Walter said concerns over immigration and the economy are helping Trump this time around after he lost his own releection bid against Biden in 2020.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"It's a coin flip," she said of the race between Harris and Trump.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin arrived in Azerbaijan's capital Baku on Sunday for a two-day state visit, Russian news agencies reported.</p>

<p>Russian television broadcast images of the Russian president's plane as it arrived in Baku in the evening.</p>

<p>His visit to the Caucasus country, a close partner of both Moscow and Turkey but also a major energy supplier to Western countries, comes against the backdrop of an unprecedented Ukrainian military offensive on Russian soil.</p>

<p>Putin is due to hold talks with his Azerbaijani counterpart Ilham Aliyev on bilateral relations and "international and regional problems", the Kremlin said.</p>

<p>The two leaders are dining Sunday evening at the Azerbaijani president's official residence, local official news agency Asertac said.</p>

<p>On Monday, Aliyev and Putin will sign joint documents and make statements to the press, said Russian agency Ria Novosti.</p>

<p>Putin will also lay a wreath on the tomb of Heydar Aliyev, father of the current leader, who was president from 1993 to 2003.</p>

<p>Earlier, the Kremlin said they would also discuss "the question of settling (the conflict) between Azerbaijan and Armenia".</p>

<p>Azerbaijan reconquered the mountainous enclave in September 2023 from the Armenian separatists who had held it for three decades.</p>

<p>Armenia accused Russia of inadequate support in its conflict with Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh.</p>

<p>Since then, Armenia has sought to deepen its ties with Western countries, especially the United States, much to the annoyance of Moscow, which considers both former Soviet republics to be in its sphere of influence.</p>

<p>Azerbaijan is a major producer of natural gas, to whom many European countries turned to make up for the sharp reduction in Russian deliveries after the start of the conflict in Ukraine in February 2022.</p>

<p>It is also hosting the COP29 climate conference in November.</p>

<p>Putin's last visit to Azerbaijan was in September 2018.</p>

<p>Putin has been under an arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court since March 2023 for the "deportation" of Ukrainian children to Russia, an accusation the Kremlin denies.</p>

<p>While the threat of arrest has limited Putin's travels abroad, Azerbaijan is not a signatory to the Rome Statute treaty that established the ICC.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel's under-pressure prime minister traded blame with Hamas on Sunday for delays in reaching a Gaza truce accord as top US diplomat Antony Blinken landed in Tel Aviv to push for a deal.</p>

<p>Making his ninth trip to the Middle East since the Gaza war began when Hamas attacked Israel in October, the US secretary of state is to meet Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other Israeli leaders.</p>

<p>Diplomats say a Gaza deal could help avert a wider conflagration, and a US official speaking on customary condition of anonymity said this is "a particularly critical time."</p>

<p>Blinken aims "to press any and all parties that it's important to get the remaining pieces of this across the finish line," said the official.</p>

<p>Ahead of the truce talks in Qatar last Thursday and Friday, Hamas had called on mediators -- rather than holding more negotiations -- to implement a framework outlined in late May by US President Joe Biden.</p>

<p>But after the Qatar talks between US, Egyptian and Qatari mediators, the United States submitted a new compromise proposal, leading Hamas on Sunday to accuse Netanyahu of obstruction.</p>

<p>According to Hamas, the proposal "responds to Netanyahu's conditions, especially his rejection of a permanent ceasefire and a comprehensive withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, and his insistence on continuing to occupy the Netzarim junction, the Rafah crossing and the Philadelphi corridor".</p>

<p>The latter two places are seen by Israel as important for preventing the flow of any weapons into the Gaza Strip, while the Netzarim junction sits at a strategic point between northern and southern Gaza.</p>

<p>Netanyahu was "fully responsible for thwarting the efforts of the mediators, obstructing an agreement, and (bears) full responsibility for the lives" of hostages in Gaza, the Islamist movement said in a statement.</p>

<p>Hamas officials have on several occasions accused Netanyahu of obstructing an agreement.</p>

<p>Western ally Jordan, hostage supporters protesting in Israel, and Hamas itself have also called for pressure on Netanyahu in order that an agreement to be reached.</p>

<p>Far-right members crucial to the prime minister's governing coalition oppose any truce.</p>

<h3><strong>Stakes have risen</strong></h3>

<p>On Sunday Netanyahu reiterated that Hamas must be pressured.</p>

<p>"Hamas, up to this moment, remains obstinate. It did not even send a representative to the talks in Doha. Therefore, the pressure should be directed at Hamas and (Yahya) Sinwar, not at the Israeli government," Netanyahu said at a cabinet meeting, referring to the Hamas chief.</p>

<p>On Tuesday Blinken is to travel on to Cairo, where ceasefire talks will resume in the coming days.</p>

<p>The Biden framework, which he said was proposed by Israel, would freeze fighting for an initial six weeks as Israeli hostages are exchanged for Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails and humanitarian aid enters the besieged Gaza Strip.</p>

<p>On Saturday, Netanyahu's office in a statement said Israeli negotiators have expressed "cautious optimism" about reaching a Gaza truce deal.</p>

<p>US, Qatari and Egyptian mediators also reported progress.</p>

<p>Months of on-off truce negotiations have taken place, so far without any agreement.</p>

<p>But the stakes have risen since the late July killings of Iran-backed rebel leaders, including Hamas political chief Ismail Haniyeh, and as the humanitarian crisis in Gaza deepened with a feared polio outbreak.</p>

<p>Israeli evacuation orders have "reduced the safe zone" in the south of the territory, leaving "no more space" for displaced Palestinians, said Samah Dib, 32.</p>

<p>Some "are sleeping on the street" while clean water is scarce and food at the markets is "very expensive and we have no money left", said Dib, who like almost all Gazans is among the displaced.</p>

<p>As efforts towards a long-sought truce continued, so did the violence in Gaza but also in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and in Lebanon, where Israeli forces and Hamas's Iran-backed ally Hezbollah have traded near-daily fire throughout the war. They did so again on Sunday.</p>

<h3><strong>The rumble of tanks</strong></h3>

<p>Civil defence rescuers in Hamas-run Gaza reported a total of 11 people killed in Israeli bombardment of Deir el-Balah and in air strikes on Jabalia refugee camp.</p>

<p>The latest killings helped push to 40,099 the death count from Gaza health ministry, which does not give details of civilian and Hamas deaths.</p>

<p>Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel that started the war resulted in the deaths of 1,198 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said troops continued operations in central and southern Gaza and "eliminated" Hamas in Rafah, on the territory's border with Egypt.</p>

<p>From the Israeli-designated safe zone in southern Gaza's Al-Mawasi, a fearful Lina Saleha, 44, said she could hear "constant artillery shelling" and the rumble of tanks "getting closer."</p>

<p>In the occupied West Bank, an attack in a Jewish settlement killed an Israeli man, a hospital said, three days after a deadly settler raid in a nearby Palestinian village.</p>

<p>In Lebanon, the UN said three peacekeepers were lightly injured in a blast in the country's south.</p>

<p>Iran and its regional allies have vowed retaliation for Haniyeh's death in Tehran -- which Israel has not claimed responsibility for -- and for an Israeli strike in Beirut that killed a top Hezbollah commander.</p>

<p>US officials have indirectly heard that Iran "want to see a ceasefire, they don't want to see regional escalation," the US official said.</p>

<p>Out of 251 hostages seized during Hamas's attack, 111 are still held in Gaza including 39 the military says are dead. More than 100 were freed during a one-week truce in November.</p>

<p>The Palestinian Prisoners' Club watchdog said that since the Gaza war began, Israeli forces have detained "more than 10,000 Palestinians" in the West Bank and annexed east Jerusalem, which Israel seized in 1967.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The CDC states that parvovirus B19 is "highly transmissible in respiratory droplets."]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has issued a health advisory concerning a significant rise in cases of parvovirus B19, commonly known as the Fifth Disease or "slapped cheek" illness due to the characteristic reddening of the cheeks it causes. This illness can be especially hazardous for pregnant women, according to the agency.</p>

<p>The CDC examined individuals with IgM antibodies, which indicate a recent infection, and found that the greatest increase occurred among children aged 5-9, with cases rising from "15% during 2022-2024 to 40% in June 2024." Across all age groups, the prevalence of these antibodies increased from 3% during 2022-2024 to 10% in June 2024, the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://people.com/slapped-cheek-illness-parvovirus-cases-rising-8696532"><em>People </em></a>reported.</p>

<p>The CDC states that parvovirus B19 is "highly transmissible in respiratory droplets." Symptoms such as fever and malaise typically develop about a week after exposure. During the second week, the distinctive facial rash appears, often accompanied by body pain.</p>

<p>While most people only need supportive care, pregnant women face a risk of "adverse fetal outcomes," including fetal anaemia, non-immune hydrops (which can strain the heart), or fetal loss. The risk is greatest if a pregnant woman contracts parvovirus between weeks 9 and 20 of pregnancy.</p>

<p>One case highlighted by NBC News involves Abby Parks, a teacher from Springfield, Illinois, who contracted parvovirus B19 at 18 weeks pregnant, resulting in fetal anaemia. She was hospitalized and received blood transfusions, which she believes were "lifesaving" for her fetus. "If that anaemia had persisted, with that low blood count, the baby could have died," Parks said.</p>

<p>The CDC has received reports from clinicians observing "more than the expected number" of pregnant individuals with parvovirus B19, including cases of severe fetal anaemia requiring transfusions or resulting in pregnancy loss.</p>

<p>The agency advises that pregnant individuals seek medical care if exposed to parvovirus B19. However, the patient is no longer contagious once the characteristic facial rash appears.</p>

<p>Now at 30 weeks, Parks says she and her fetus are under close monitoring, describing the illness as "truly the most difficult experience to go through." She adds, "He wasn't guaranteed to come through the fetal anaemia."</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>To many, reading is a paragon of hobbies. If you take the wide spectrum of leisure activities that humans devote much of their lives to pursue, reading sits snugly in the Goldilocks zone: the sweet spot that defines the perfect avocation. Consider the evidence: an interest in philately, numismatics, or collecting trinkets of any kind really, marks you out as someone who spends their weekends caressing their collection albums and murmuring, 'My precious....'. Opting for a more energetic brand of recreation - like cycling or running, for instance - signals to society that if anyone makes the mistake of approaching you, they will hear about your training regimen in insufferable detail.</p>

<h2><strong>Congratulations, You Are A 'Sophisticate' Now</strong></h2>

<p>On the other hand, reading - as a hobby - offers a number of benefits. You can win any debate so long as you preface your argument with the words, 'Well, I know that's what you heard on a podcast but I read in a book...'. When your friends are raving about a new movie, you can declare with a sniff, 'To be perfectly honest, the book is much better...'. Surrounding yourself with books can earn you the admiration of your peers. You don't even need to have read them - merely possessing a well-stocked bookcase can make you a sophisticate (ask any interior designer). In these times of snappy reels, clickbait headlines, and dwindling attention spans, book readers are revered as 'Zen masters' who can ignore the lure of doomscrolling and immerse themselves in the textual world.</p>

<p>It is no wonder then that so many parents hope their children grow up to be readers, or that countless adults strive to adopt reading as a hobby. Yet, you rarely hear anyone talking about the undiagnosed emotional damage caused by books - anyone who has read <em>A Little Life</em> by Hanya Yanagihara will know what I mean - and the pernicious effects of reading in general. It is about time someone acted to remedy this grave oversight.</p>

<h2><strong>That Perpetual Despair...</strong></h2>

<p>Allowing yourself to be consumed by a love for books can harm you, broadly speaking, in four significant ways. To begin with, it can cause you to be assailed by a sense of despair, a feeling of crushing hopelessness every time you enter a bookshop. As you browse the shelves and stack volumes in the crook of your arm, you realise you will never get around to reading all the books that call out to you. Some are able to make peace with this doleful reality.</p>

<p>Others, those of a more defiant disposition, refuse to be cowed. They redouble their efforts, but since reading capacity is constrained by physical limits, these efforts end up being channelled solely towards the acquisition of books. The Japanese have an elegant word to describe this condition: <em>tsundoku</em>. It means a penchant for stockpiling books with the genuine intention to read them all - subject only to the minor requirement of first attaining immortality. If you are also afflicted with this malady, do not be disheartened. Karl Lagerfeld is said to have owned over 3,00,000 books. At least, things are not as grim for you (I hope).</p>

<h2><strong>Guilt Meets Snobbery</strong></h2>

<p>This abundance of material naturally leads to the second pitfall of reading: experiencing guilt. No matter which book you pick up, you are sure to feel a twinge of regret for the ones you're compelled to set aside. Every time you pull out your favourite Agatha Christie or P. G. Wodehouse title from the bookshelf, you can hear your dusty copy of <em>War and Peace</em> tutting in disappointment. In the library, when you're lingering in the Young Adult fantasy section - 'young' is relative, after all - you can feel <em>Great Expectations</em> glaring at you from across the aisle. Every breezy read - every literary guilty pleasure - is laced with the shame of having abandoned <em>Far from the Madding Crowd</em> after a dozen pages.</p>

<p>A large part of this contrition is attributable to the third ill effect of reading: snobbery.</p>

<h2><strong>The Struggle To 'Belong'</strong></h2>

<p>The world of bibliophiles can be alarmingly tribal and each clique has its idiosyncrasies. You have the acolytes of the Russian masters - a bleak lot who can be disqualified from their clan if they ever crack a smile. Crime fiction aficionados tend to sidle up to you, introduce themselves, and then lean in to whisper, "So... what do you think is the best way to get rid of a body?" The devotees of speculative fiction can be identified by their pallid skin, thick glasses, and ability to talk for hours about the genealogy of dragons; and then there are the readers of business management books, who pride themselves on having no imagination.</p>

<p>Every group believes their reading habits to be loftier and they are all perpetually at odds with each other. Indeed, there is only one thing that unites them: a shared loathing for lovers of romance novels, and, let's be honest, you can see where they're coming from.</p>

<p>If you do not throw in your lot with any one of these clubs, then you must forever contend with their tidal pulls as you chart your literary journey. As you flit from one genre to the next, you will be welcomed and then mocked, your choice of books forever questioned and dismissed as being inferior to a host of other suggestions. If you somehow muster the will to ignore these challenges and keep going, then you will eventually have to tackle the fourth, and most fatal, misfortune to befall a reader. You will begin to believe that you, too, can be a writer.</p>

<h2><strong>'Can I .... Be A Writer?'</strong></h2>

<p>Anyone who spends a substantial amount of time reading books soon begins to harbour fantasies of writing one themselves. It is one of those immutable laws of nature (those who read poetry are - unfortunately for the rest of us - especially susceptible to this affliction). This is one of life's greatest tragedies because writing is a masochistic, time-consuming and exhausting pursuit. When you choose to become a writer, the only people who suffer more than you are your friends and family members who have to read your early output. It is only because they pretend to enjoy it that you are encouraged to continue. Pick up any celebrated guide on the craft of writing - be it <em>Bird by Bird</em> by Anne Lamott or <em>On Writing </em>by Stephen King - and it will tell you that as a writer you must persevere; you must write with dedication and doggedness, and perhaps one day you will be wildly successful and publish a manuscript that makes a tenth of the sales of the latest book by a social media celebrity.</p>

<p>Most bookworms endure one or more of these ordeals, and yet, astonishingly, they continue to read. Books continue to exist, and some people still find the greatest joy in getting lost in their pages, in weaving stories of their own.Most bookworms endure one or more of these ordeals, and yet, astonishingly, they continue to read. As far as book lovers are concerned, that is a blessing.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Ferris wheel caught fire at a German summer music festival and injured at least thirty people, including four police officers, as per a report in the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/08/18/world-news/germany-ferris-wheel-bursts-into-flames-at-highfield-music-festival/?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=nypost&amp;utm_source=twitter"><em>New York Post.</em></a> The incident took place in a gondola at the Highfield Festival at Stormthaler Lake, at around 9.13 pm. The fire began in one lower tub and quickly spread to another, scaring the people on the ride.</p>

<p>Videos captured from the festival showed the Ferris wheel spinning despite the two gondolas being turned into fireballs. Further, thick, black smoke was also seen in the night sky with several people screaming.</p>

<br />
At least 30 people, including police officials have been injured according to reports from the region. <a href="https://t.co/nMMfmxc4Pl">pic.twitter.com/nMMfmxc4Pl</a></p>
— The Secret Firefighter UK (@TheSecretFF999) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheSecretFF999/status/1825056294459629688?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 18, 2024</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>The conductors stopped the ride and reversed it so that the burning vehicle was positioned close to the top of the wheel. The video showed how powerful the fire was-it blazed white at its centre.</p>

<p>According to the outlet, the 30 people who were treated for injuries sustained mild cases of smoke inhalation. However, two were seriously injured.</p>

<p>German rapper Ski Aggu was on stage when the blaze started and was also instructed to carry on with his performance despite the accident. "I was just told through my earpiece that I should not end the show under any circumstances," the rapper said on his Instagram. He said he was told to continue performing to avoid "mass panic."</p>

<p>Further, the two gondolas were successfully tipped upside down by firefighters to stop the fire from spreading. "We currently know that there are over 30 injured people, including four injured police officers, but all of them are probably slightly injured," police spokeswoman Josephin Sader told the tabloid BILD.</p>

<p>The fire has been put out, leaving the two gondolas destroyed. According to the organisers, a technical issue with the Ferris wheel was the reason for the fire.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Deep in the Amazon rainforest, a semi-nomadic indigenous community is thriving. This community defies conventional norms on ageing and health. The Tsimanes, consisting of 16,000 people, live a fully subsistence lifestyle, relying on hunting, foraging and farming to survive. Scientists have been studying this unique group for two decades, and have uncovered remarkable findings till now.</p>

<p>Martina Canchi Nate, an 84-year-old Tsimanes woman, digs up yucca trees, cuts down plantain trees and carries heavy loads with ease, faster than her younger companions, as per a <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ceq55l2gdxxo ">BBC</a> report. This level of physical activity is not unusual among Tsimanes of her age. Researchers have discovered that this group has the healthiest arteries ever studied and brains that age more slowly than those in North America, Europe and elsewhere.</p>

<p>The Tsimanes' secret lies in their active lifestyle, with an average of 16,000 to 17,000 steps per day. They spend less than 10 percent of daylight hours in sedentary activities, compared to 54 percent in industrial populations. Hunting and gathering require over eight hours of physical activity, covering 18km. Their diet is high in fibre, with minimal processed foods, alcohol and cigarettes.</p>

<p>Their diet consists of 72 percent of calories from carbohydrates, 14 percent from fat and maximum protein sources from hunted animals, such as birds, monkeys and fish. They do not eat fried food. This combination of physical activity and nutrient-dense food contributes to their remarkable health.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(17)30752-3/abstract ">2017 Lancet study</a> showed that the Tsimanes have the healthiest arteries ever studied, with 65 percent of those over 75 showing no signs of clogged blood vessels. This is in stark contrast to Americans of the same age, where 80 percent have signs of clogged arteries.</p>

<p>Research has also shown that the Tsimanes have up to 70 percent less brain atrophy than people of the same age in industrialised countries. And there are zero cases of Alzheimer's among the entire adult population.</p>

<p>Figuring out the Tsimanes' ages is tricky. Some struggle with counting, so they use other methods like mission records or how long they have known each other. Scientists estimate ages based on children's ages. For example, a woman, Hilda, is recorded as 81, but she thinks she is 100.</p>

<p>Despite their age, Tsimanes like Juan (78) and Martina (84) remain active. Juan goes hunting, while Martina weaves roofs from jungle plants. However, they admit it is getting harder.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Many Tsimanes don't reach old age. When the study began, their average life expectancy was just 45 years. Now it is 50. Researchers noted that those who reach 80 have survived childhood diseases and infections. Researchers believe early infections might contribute to the Tsimanes' healthy ageing. They have found high levels of pathogens and inflammation, which suggest constant battles with infections.</p>

<p>The Tsimanes' lifestyle is changing. Forest fires have reduced hunting opportunities, and Juan has started raising livestock. They now have boats with motors to make markets more accessible and introduce new foods like sugar and oil.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Tsimanes' lifestyle is changing, and so is their health. They are rowing less, which means less physical activity. Twenty years ago, there were hardly any cases of diabetes, but now they are starting to appear. Cholesterol levels are also rising in younger Tsimanes.</p>

<p>Despite the changes, Hilda, 81 (or 100, as she claims), has a carefree attitude towards ageing. “I'm not afraid of dying,” she told the BBC. “They're going to bury me and I'm going to stay there… very still.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bangladesh on Sunday reopened all educational institutions, including universities, secondary schools and colleges, across the country after more than a month of closure due to violence centring the student-led protests that led to the ouster of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.</p>

<p>The educational institutions in Bangladesh were closed indefinitely on July 17 to ensure the safety of students in the wake of clashes that erupted during the recent movement demanding reform of the job quota system.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Education on Thursday issued a directive to reopen the institutions under its jurisdiction. All the educational institutions reopened on Sunday, after a month of closure.</p>

<p>According to Somoy Television, a Bengali news channel based in Dhaka, “All concerned have been asked to take necessary steps to resume academic activities in all the educational institutions from August 18 following the instruction of Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus,” a notification signed by deputy secretary Mosammat Rahima Akhtar, said on August 15.</p>

<p>In the morning, school students in uniform were seen going to their institutions, many accompanied by guardians, the Daily Star reported.</p>

<p>Many points of Dhaka city are witnessing severe traffic congestion due to the reopening of educational institutions.</p>

<p>The working week is from Sunday to Thursday in Bangladesh.</p>

<p>Initially, classes were scheduled to resume on August 4 in all government primary schools, except in the 12 city corporations and Narsingdi municipality, but this was also postponed.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the postponed Higher Secondary Certificate (HSC) and equivalent examinations will be resumed from September 11.</p>

<p>According to the revised routine, the exams will be completed on October 23.</p>

<p>Classes at public universities have been suspended since July 1 when teachers went on strike in protest of a new pension scheme.</p>

<p>After the fall of the Sheikh Hasina government on August 5, the educational institutions were declared open on August 7, but the academic activities could not be resumed fully due to the low attendance of students.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Thomas Matthew Crooks, the would-be assassin, fired eight shots from a warehouse rooftop, injuring the former US president and several others in the crowd.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A police sniper's quick response likely saved numerous lives during the assassination attempt at Donald Trump's campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, last month. According to a preliminary report by Congressman Clay Higgins, the sniper's bullet struck the gunman's rifle, causing damage that temporarily knocked him down and disrupted his aim.</p>

<p>On July 13, 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks, the would-be assassin, fired eight shots from a warehouse rooftop, injuring the former US president and several others in the crowd, and killing one person. However, the Butler SWAT operator's precise shot prevented further harm, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/17/trump-assassination-attempt-swat-officer-report">The Guardian</a> reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The local law enforcement officer reportedly “ran towards the threat”, firing from 100 yards away and hitting the gunman's rifle with “a single shot”, temporarily knocking him off balance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“The 9th shot fired on J13 was from a Butler SWAT operator from the ground about 100 yards away from the AGR building [where the gunman was positioned]. Shot 9 hit Crooks' rifle stock and fragged his face/neck/right shoulder area from the stock breaking up,” the report said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The report called the SWAT operator a “total badass”, adding that “when he had sighted the shooter Crooks as a mostly obscured by foliage moving target on the AGR rooftop, he immediately left his assigned post and ran towards the threat, running to a clear shot position directly into the line of fire while Crooks was firing 8 rounds.”</p>

<p>Crooks was wounded by fragments from the damaged rifle and was subsequently killed by a federal sniper as he attempted to get back up. “A 10th and final shot” was fired by another Secret Service sniper, striking the gunman in the head and ending the threat, the report read.&nbsp;</p>

<p>New records obtained by <a href="http://https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/newly-released-docs-show-security-plans-ahead-trump/story?id=112907116 ">ABC News</a> show local authorities discussing security for the rally, including requests for extra support. The Secret Service reassigned officers from President Biden's detail to President Trump's after Biden dropped out of the election race. The director of the Secret Service resigned after facing criticism for the agency's response to the shooting. The FBI is investigating the protection failure, and Congress has started inquiries.</p>

<p>Following the incident, Donald Trump's campaign team has announced plans to bolster security protocols, including the installation of bulletproof glass around stages at future outdoor rallies. The former president did not have the protection during his 13 July rally in Butler when Crooks' bullet nearly hit him squarely in the head.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former US President Donald Trump once again sparked controversy by criticising two Olympic gold medalist female boxers, labelling them as men during a campaign rally in Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>Trump's remarks, made in the context of his pledge to "keep men out of women's sports," have reignited debates over gender and sports.</p>

<p>Referring to the athletes at the recently concluded Paris Olympics, Trump stated, "They were men. They transitioned to women, and they were in the boxing," adding that it is "so demeaning to women."</p>

<p>Trump's comments follow a pattern of his rallies where he has frequently targeted transgender athletes.</p>

<p>The two Olympic gold medalist athletes in question, Lin Yu-ting of Taiwan and Imane Khelif of Algeria have been at the centre of global scrutiny due to misconceptions about their gender.</p>

<p>Both athletes were disqualified from last year's Women's World Championships by the now-banned International Boxing Association (IBA) over alleged failures in gender eligibility tests, despite both being born and raised as women.</p>

<p>Khelif and Lin, who were cleared to compete in women's boxing at the Paris 2024 Olympics, had been disqualified from the Women's World Championships in India due to elevated testosterone levels, according to the IBA.</p>

<p>The IBA's decision, which stripped both boxers of their medals and barred them from women's competition, was widely criticised for its lack of transparency and fairness.</p>

<p>The International Olympic Committee (IOC), which is overseeing the boxing events in Paris, cleared both Lin and Khelif to compete in the Olympics, basing their eligibility on the athletes' passport gender.</p>

<p>The IOC condemned the harassment faced by Khelif, who has been subjected to online abuse and threats following the ruling by the IBA. Khelif spoke out against the bullying, warning of its potential to ruin lives.</p>

<p>Trump's repeated criticism of Khelif, including referring to her as a man, has drawn widespread condemnation from various quarters. His remarks come amidst ongoing debates about the inclusion of transgender athletes in sports, an issue that has polarised opinions across the globe.</p>

<p>The situation has highlighted the broader challenges faced by athletes like Khelif and Lin, who are caught in the crossfire of debates over gender, fairness, and the intersection of sports and identity.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Billionaire Elon Musk has compared Brazil's Chief Justice Alexandre de Moraes to the infamous Harry Potter villain, Lord Voldemort. The SpaceX CEO made the comparison in a tweet, which has since gone viral, featuring side-by-side images of Judge Moraes and Voldemort.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Judge Moraes is seen in a black cloak similar to that worn by Voldemort, who is wielding a wand in the other image. "The resemblance is uncanny. Alexandre de Voldemort," The Tesla CEO wrote in the caption on X.</p>

<p>An X user added fuel to the controversy by creating a&nbsp;video that transitioned Brazil's Chief Justice&nbsp;into Voldemort. The edited clip showed Mr Moraes rising in the air, cloaked in black, before morphing into the Harry Potter villain holding a wand. &nbsp;</p>

<p>This comparison comes on the heels of a major development involving X's operations in Brazil. On Saturday, the social media giant announced it would be shuttering its operations in the country, citing an ongoing legal battle with the Brazil Chief Justice as the primary reason. The shutdown was described as "effective immediately," although Brazilian users will still have access to the platform.</p>

<p>"We are deeply saddened that we have been forced to make this decision," X said in an official statement, placing the blame squarely on Moraes. The company claimed that the decision was a direct result of the actions of the Brazilian Supreme Court judge.&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Last night, Alexandre de Moraes threatened our legal representative in Brazil with arrest if we do not comply with his censorship orders. He did so in a secret order, which we share here to expose his actions.<br />

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>The legal conflict between X and Judge Moraes has been simmering for some time. Earlier this year, the judge ordered X to block certain accounts accused of spreading disinformation and hate speech, particularly those linked to supporters of former far-right President Jair Bolsonaro. Mr Bolsonaro had repeatedly cast doubt on the integrity of Brazil's electronic voting system, claiming it was vulnerable to fraud - a claim that fueled tensions leading up to the tightly contested 2022 election.&nbsp;<br />
Alexandre de Moraes, who also presides over Brazil's Superior Electoral Tribunal, has been a vocal advocate for combating disinformation. "Freedom of expression doesn't mean freedom of aggression," Mr Moraes has said in the past, as per an <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/8/17/elon-musks-x-to-shut-operations-in-brazil-amid-bitter-legal-fight">Al Jazeera</a> report. "It doesn't mean the freedom to defend tyranny."</p>

<p><br />
In the latest escalation, X claimed Mr Moraes secretly threatened one of its legal representatives in Brazil with arrest if it did not comply with legal orders to take down some content. "As a result, to protect the safety of our staff, we have made the decision to close our operation in Brazil," they said in their statement.&nbsp;<br />
Elon Musk, never one to shy away from controversy, doubled down on his criticism of Mr Moraes, calling him "an utter disgrace to justice" in a separate post on X.&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Due to demands by “Justice” <a href="https://twitter.com/alexandre?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Alexandre</a> in Brazil that would require us to break (in secret) Brazilian, Argentinian, American and international law, ???? has no choice but to close our local operations in Brazil.<br />

<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-08/hb13n3t8_imane-khelif_625x300_18_August_24.jpg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>The kind of bullying and abuse Olympic boxer Imane Khelif has been subjected to makes one thing crystal clear: in the age of social media, misinformation is easiest to amplify when it's rooted in misogyny, transphobia and racism, and amplified by verified, blue-ticked accounts on X. It has also made it clear that trans-hate will eventually come to haunt all women who do not fit traditional, conservative definitions of femininity.</p>

<p>Now that Imane Khelif has refused to take the online abuse in silence and is suing the key amplifiers - J.K. Rowling and Elon Musk - let's revisit the brutal online hate campaign unleashed against the Olympic gold medallist, all for being a 'non-feminine' woman of colour.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>The Prime Purveyors Of Hate</strong></h2>

<p>On August 1, after facing Khelif for a whopping 45-second battle, Italian boxer Angela Carini forfeited the match. Later, she would tell the press, "I have never been punched so hard" and shed tears in front of the camera, as anyone would have in her position. However, seeing a white woman cry on television was, of course, too much to bear for champions of women's rights like author J. K. Rowling, who has had a history of making transphobic comments. Rowling cried foul on X about a "man" punching a woman and about men's rights activism having gone too far. Even the owner of X, Elon Musk, could not resist chiming in. It's another story that Musk's own views about transgender persons are worth some scrutiny and may be best described by his estranged daughter who he refuses to acknowledge.</p>

<p>The Imane Khelif case underlines a hard but unsurprising truth: we are not as progressive in 2024 as we would like to believe. Sure, there are more people today who are accepting of queer rights, gender equality, and just human rights in general, but in the country called the internet, this population is sparse.</p>

<h2><strong>Trans Hate Is Misogyny</strong></h2>

<p>When two people with a combined following of over 200 million people put out such derogatory posts against a woman, their legions of followers are bound to spew out the same misinformation, often with vile language. But Rowling and Musk's comments also fanned the fire of deep-rooted transphobia and misogyny that still burns in all stratas of human classes, races, and nationalities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Trans hate is just another catalyst for overall misogyny. Groups abound on Reddit and Facebook where people aligned with the Rowling ideology simply attack any female celebrity they don't think is "woman enough" and must therefore, be a transsexual or transgender; there is a word for this group too, "transvestigators". &nbsp;For example, if you like to lift weights and be muscular, then you are not feminine, and hence make for a perfect target for these 'tranvestigators'. Like sports? Big cars? Not dainty, petite, blonde, and light-eyed enough? Wear too much makeup as if to hide male appearance? Wear too little makeup because you are a man trying to pass off as a 'sporty woman'? Well, women who exhibit such traits "aren't women", according to tranvestigators.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Coming back to the hate campaign against Khelif. Soon after her win in Paris and its fallout, conservative-leaning media outlets and social media handles started talking about her 2023 disqualification by the International Boxing Association (IBA) for failing a 'gender eligibility test'. No matter the fact that the IBA itself was questioned by the Olympics for their 'methods' and that there have been accusations of corruption as well. The International Olympic Association (IOC) banned the IBA last year over its governance and finance issues, with the Olympic body allowing the boxing competition to be held in Paris. But alas, this grain of truth was buried deep under the rubble of misinformation that flooded the internet.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A number of questions have been raised amid this storm. "How can 'he' be a woman?", "IBA must have banned 'him' for a reason!", "XY is a man! Only men have Testosterone!", "He clearly looks like a man. He is built like a man."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Let's try to answer them.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Man, Woman, Other?</strong></h2>

<p>Khelif's story is very <em>Dangal</em>-like. Indian audiences, if they read her full interview with UNICEF, may relate to the story of a young girl joining a sport that's dominated by men. But unlike <em>Dangal</em>, she did not have a father ready to fight the world. She fought mostly alone in her childhood, while her family battled poverty to feed their children and sustain the family.</p>

<p>There's also the fact that Algeria is a deeply religious Islamic country, where being trans may invite a host of legal challenges. If any of the 'tranvestigators' like Rowling or Musk followers had bothered to do a simple Google search, they would know Algeria would probably never send a 'trans' person to represent their country in the Olympics. &nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>XX or XY?</strong></h2>

<p>Doesn't matter, honestly. Anyone who has studied genetics and chromosomes can answer this: the set of chromosomes that define sex (not gender) are named so based on their shape. Zoya Fatima, a teacher at Jamia Senior Secondary School, explains that women have two chromosomes shaped like 'X', while in men, one of them is shaped like a 'Y'. "Genetic mutation can cause a foetus with XX to have a Y-shaped chromosome," she explains, "They can have all female genitalia, even uterus in some cases, but ovaries in almost all cases are non-functional. But they can be mothers via IVF and have normal pregnancies. So it is incorrect to say that all XY automatically classify as male and man."</p>

<p>If we were to go by the definitions recommended by conservative social media, then millions of women would immediately lose their right to be called a woman for having elevated testosterone levels. While testosterone is considered the 'male hormone', women produce it too - many with hormonal disorders, such as PCOS, tend to produce too much of it. Will these conditions void a woman's right to be called a 'woman'?&nbsp;</p>

<p>If we consider science for our definitions, the majority of women with XY or XXY or XXYY chromosomal structures have one common denominator: a non-functional ovary. So that begs the question, is a perfectly functional ovary fundamental for being classified as a 'woman'? If yes, what about a few thousand women who have ovarian insufficiency? Will they cease to be known as women?&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>The Question Of Race</strong></h2>

<p>Women of colour who don't fit conservative definitions of femininity have always had it worse. Barely a day before her match, Khelif's Hungarian opponent, Luca Hamori, posted an incendiary picture on Instagram that showed Khelif as a 'beast'. For centuries now, Black women have been mocked for their 'masculinity'. Not too far in India itself, sprinter Duttee Chand had been on the receiving end of primitive gender tests. "In 2014, I challenged the IOC's rule that a person with a higher testosterone level should not participate in the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Switzerland. It was noted that hormonal levels cannot increase athletic performance. I suffered a lot at that time. I faced a lot of controversy regarding my gender," Chand told <em>PTI </em>after the Imane Khelif controversy erupted.</p>

<p>The abuse and attacks Imane Khelif has faced online will be remembered for years to come. The key takeaway is this: misinformation driven by racist, misogynist ideologies often travels much, much faster than the truth.&nbsp;</p>

       <description><![CDATA[The enormous prints, spaced up to 75cm apart, are thought to have been made by a large herbivore from the late Triassic period.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A casual summer beach walk turned into a prehistoric adventure for a 10-year-old girl in the UK when she&nbsp;stumbled upon enormous footprints.&nbsp;While strolling along the shore with her mother in Penarth, Tegan stumbled upon five massive footprints, which dinosaur experts believe belong to a Camelot that roamed the area over 200 million years ago, <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c049pe7gx6do">BBC</a></em> reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The enormous prints, spaced up to 75cm apart, are thought to have been made by a large herbivore from the late Triassic period. Palaeontologists are now working to verify the discovery, with the National Museum Wales' palaeontology curator expressing confidence that the prints are genuine, leaving Tegan and her mother thrilled to have walked in the footsteps of dinosaurs.</p>

<p>"We've got five footprints and we're talking about half-to-three-quarters of a metre between each one. These footprints are so big, it would have to be a type of dinosaur called a sauropodomorpha,'' Cindy Howells told the BBC's The Dinohunters programme.</p>

<p>The incredible discovery was made on the South Wales coast, where&nbsp;the girl's mother Claire used to live.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"It was so cool and exciting. We were just out looking to see what we could find, we didn't think we'd find anything. We found these were big holes that looked like dinosaur footprints, so mum took some pictures, emailed the museum and it was from a long-necked dinosaur,'' said Tegan.</p>

<p>Following the remarkable discovery, Claire reached out to Cindy via email just a few days later. The dinosaur footprints had been found embedded in red siltstone at Lavernock Point, a location situated between Cardiff and Barry along the Glamorgan Heritage Coast.</p>

<p>Cindy, a seasoned dinosaur expert with 40 years of experience in the region, was convinced of the authenticity of the footprints due to the consistent stride pattern. "What's telling is the alternating left and right feet, with a consistent distance between them. If they were just random holes, we'd be sceptical, but this pattern suggests a deliberate gait. It's a significant discovery, and the excitement is palpable when someone contacts us with a confirmed dinosaur find - it's truly thrilling'', she explained.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"It's hard to comprehend you're walking on the same beach that hundreds of millions of years ago some massive prehistoric animal was here. You can spend a lifetime looking for dinosaur treasures so for it to happen for Tegan at this age is great,'' she added.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

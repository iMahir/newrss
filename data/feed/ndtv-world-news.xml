       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sean "Diddy" Combs -- the rap mogul whose star has plunged after a wave of sex trafficking accusations and assault lawsuits -- was arrested by federal agents in Manhattan late Monday, a US federal court said.</p>

<p>The attorney for the Southern District of New York, Damian Williams, said in a statement that the arrest stemmed from a sealed indictment filed by his office.</p>

<p>"We expect to move to unseal the indictment in the morning and will have more to say at that time," he said, without providing further details of the charges.</p>

<p>Diddy's lawyer Marc Agnifilo said in a statement provided to AFP that Combs had voluntarily relocated to New York anticipating the charges.</p>

<p>Combs's lawyer said their team is "disappointed with the decision to pursue what we believe is an unjust prosecution of Mr. Combs by the US Attorney's Office."</p>

<p>The rapper is the target of several civil lawsuits that characterize him as a violent sexual predator who used alcohol and drugs to subdue his victims.</p>

<p>His homes were raided in March by federal agents, in a heavily publicized bicoastal operation that indicated a federal investigation and potential criminal case was mounting against Combs.</p>

<p>Armed agents entered his sprawling luxury properties in Miami and Los Angeles, marking a rapid downfall for the powerful music industry figure who in recent years has vied to rebrand himself as "Brother Love."</p>

<p>His legal team said Monday that Combs was being "cooperative with this investigation" and "looks forward to clearing his name in court."</p>

<h3><strong>Bombshell suit&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>The artist, who's gone by various monikers including Puff Daddy and P Diddy, was widely credited as being key to hip hop's journey from the streets to the bottle-service club.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Over the decades he's amassed vast wealth not least due to his ventures in the liquor industry.</p>

<p>But despite his efforts to cultivate an image of a smooth party kingpin and business magnate, a spate of lawsuits describe Combs as a violent man who used his celebrity to prey on women.</p>

<p>The artist has denied all accusations against him.</p>

<p>He has no major convictions but has long been trailed by allegations of physical assault, dating back well into the 1990s.</p>

<p>Late last year the floodgates opened after singer Cassie, whose real name is Casandra Ventura, alleged Combs subjected her to more than a decade of coercion by physical force and drugs as well as a 2018 rape.</p>

<p>The pair met when Ventura was 19 and he was 37, after which he signed her to his label and they began a romantic relationship.</p>

<p>The bombshell suit was quickly settled out of court, but a string of similarly lurid sexual assault claims followed -- including one in December by a woman who alleged Combs and others gang-raped her when she was 17.</p>

<p>Disturbing surveillance video then emerged in May showing Combs physically assaulting his then-girlfriend Ventura, corroborating allegations she made in the now-settled case.</p>

<h3><strong>Global fame with dark shadow</strong></h3>

<p>Born Sean John Combs on November 4, 1969 in Harlem, the artist entered the industry as an intern in 1990 at Uptown Records where he eventually became a talent director.</p>

<p>He gained a reputation as a party planner, which would be central to his brand as his fame rose.</p>

<p>In 1991 he promoted a celebrity basketball game and concert at the City College of New York that left nine people dead after a stampede.</p>

<p>The event was over capacity by the thousands and resulted in a string of lawsuits, with Combs blamed for hiring inadequate security.</p>

<p>He was fired from Uptown and founded his own label, Bad Boy Records.</p>

<p>Thus began a quick ascent to the top of East Coast hip hop, along with his disciple, the late The Notorious B.I.G.</p>

<p>Combs boasted a number of major signed acts and production collaborations with the likes of Mary J Blige, Usher, Lil' Kim, TLC, Mariah Carey and Boyz II Men.</p>

<p>He was also a Grammy-winning rapper in his own right, debuting with the chart-topping single "Can't Nobody Hold Me Down" and his album "No Way Out."</p>

<p>He built an image as a brash hustler with unapologetic swagger, a major producer who also ventured into Hollywood, reality television and fashion and had high-profile romantic links with the likes of Jennifer Lopez.</p>

<p>But a dark history of violence and serious misconduct has long haunted his fame -- and now appears to be eclipsing it.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sky gazers are in for a double treat tonight with two celestial events occurring in a rare coincidence -- a super harvest Moon and partial lunar eclipse -- on Tuesday night.</p>

<p>The Super Harvest Moon on Tuesday night will experience a partial lunar eclipse making it appear slightly larger in the night sky.</p>

<p>The visual delight will be visible in western Asia, North and South America, Europe, Africa, and parts of Antarctica. It will not be visible from India as during the time of the lunar eclipse, the Moon would be below the horizon in the country. It will appear at 8:04 am in New Delhi.</p>

<p>The term "Supermoon" was coined by astrologer Richard Nolle in 1979 as either a new or full Moon that occurs when the Moon is within 90 per cent of its closest to Earth.</p>

<p>The Old Farmer's Almanac calls the full moon of September as the Harvest moon, referring to when corn harvests traditionally started.</p>

<p>The eclipse occurs when the Moon is slightly closer to Earth, which happens because the Moon's orbit is slightly elliptical, or oval-shaped.</p>

<p>As per NASA, the Moon will appear full for about three days, from Monday evening through Thursday morning.</p>

<p>The Moon will start entering the Earth's partial shadow at 8:41 pm EDT on Tuesday (6:11 am IST, Wednesday).</p>

<p>NASA noted that “the slight dimming of the Moon will be difficult to notice until the top edge of the Moon starts entering the full shadow”.</p>

<p>The peak of the eclipse will be at 10:44 pm (8:14 am IST).</p>

<p>As it is a partial eclipse, “only the top 8 per cent of the Moon will be in full shadow”.</p>

<p>The Moon will finish exiting the full shadow at 11:16 pm and the partial shadow on Wednesday at 12:47 am.</p>

<p>"This will be the second of four consecutive Supermoons, appearing larger than last month's Supermoon and effectively tied with the full Moon in October for the closest full Moon of the year," NASA said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Less than two months ahead of the COP29 United Nations Climate Summit, the Azerbaijani leadership laid out its plans on Tuesday for what it hoped to achieve, as countries continue to wrestle with how to raise ambitions for a new financing target.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Less than two months ahead of the COP29 United Nations Climate Summit, the Azerbaijani leadership laid out its plans on Tuesday for what it hoped to achieve, as countries continue to wrestle with how to raise ambitions for a new financing target.</p>

<p>The main task for the November summit is for countries to agree on a new annual target for funding that wealthy countries will pay to help poorer nations cope with climate change. Many developing countries say they cannot upgrade their targets to cut emissions faster without first receiving more financial support to invest in doing this.</p>

<p>With countries remaining far from agreement on the financing goal, the COP29 presidency this week outlined more than a dozen side initiatives that could raise ambitions, but do not require party negotiation and building consensus which can hamper progress. These take the form of new funds, pledges, and declarations that national governments can adopt.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Notably, this includes a fund with voluntary contributions from fossil fuel-producing countries and companies for the public and private sectors working on climate issues, as well as grants that can be doled out to assist with climate-fuelled natural disasters in developing countries.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Such side agendas use "the convening power of COP and the hosts' respective national capabilities to form coalitions and drive progress," said Mukhtar Babayev, who holds the rotating COP presidency, in a letter to all parties and stakeholders.</p>

<p>Over 120 countries pledged at last year's COP28 summit in Dubai, for example, to triple renewable energy capacity by 2030.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The COP29 presidency also hopes to build support around a pledge to increase global energy storage capacity six times above 2022 levels, reaching 1,500 gigawatts by 2030. This would include a commitment to scale up investments in energy grids, adding or refurbishing more than 80 million km (50 million miles) by 2040.</p>

<p>Babayev, who is Azerbaijan's minister of ecology and natural resources, said the agenda would "help to enhance ambition by bringing stakeholders together around common principles and goals."</p>

<p>"We hope to address some of the most pressing issues while also highlighting remaining priorities," he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another declaration would see countries and companies create a global market for clean hydrogen, addressing regulatory, technological, financing and standardisation barriers.</p>

<p>COP29 leaders have also appealed for a "COP Truce" that would highlight the importance of peace and climate action.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Despite countries' existing climate commitments, carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels hit a record high last year, and the world just registered its hottest summer on record as temperatures climb.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[In his memo, Mr Jassy wrote that he expects the employees to adhere to the new policy beginning January 2, 2025.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Amazon is asking its corporate staff to return to the office five days a week starting in January, CEO Andy Jassy wrote in a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/ceo-andy-jassy-latest-update-on-amazon-return-to-office-manager-team-ratio" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>memo </em></a>on September 16. In his memo, Mr Jassy wrote that he expects the employees to adhere to the new policy beginning January 2, 2025.</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/09/16/amazon-return-to-office-five-days-week/" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>The Washington Post</em></a>, before this change, Amazon employees were required to be in the office three days a week.</p>

<p>"When we look back over the last five years, we continue to believe that the advantages of being together in the office are significant," Jassy's note to staff said. "We've observed that it's easier for our teammates to learn, model, practice, and strengthen our culture; collaborating, brainstorming, and inventing are simpler and more effective; teaching and learning from one another are more seamless; and, teams tend to be better connected to one another."</p>

<p>"Before the pandemic, it was not a given that folks could work remotely two days a week, and that will also be true moving forward - our expectation is that people will be in the office outside of extenuating circumstances," Mr Jassy said.</p>

<p>Amazon's announcement comes as more companies scale back on remote work and enforce stricter return-to-office policies. While Amazon is the first major tech firm to mandate a full week in the office, other tech companies have been gradually revising their policies in recent years, taking firmer stances. Companies like SAP, AT&amp;T, and Dell have also rolled back their flexible work arrangements. In response, some employees have resisted, with threats, protests, or even resignations over the new policies.</p>

<p>Tech companies were early adopters of flexible work arrangements during the pandemic, often touting the success of remote operations. However, more than four years later, many of those companies are bringing employees back to the office, at least on a part-time basis. Even Zoom, which became a symbol of remote work during the pandemic, has called its employees back part-time. Other companies outside the tech industry, such as Disney, Goldman Sachs, and Bank of America, have also reversed their remote work policies.</p>

<p>Amazon's CEO, Andy Jassy, stated that the company's updated policy will resemble pre-pandemic norms. While exceptions will still be allowed for reasons such as a sick child, emergencies, or the need for isolation, employees will no longer be able to work from home two days a week without a valid reason, unless they have explicit approval for remote work from their supervisor.</p>

<p>Jassy also mentioned plans to flatten Amazon's organizational structure by increasing the ratio of employees to managers, aiming to reduce bureaucracy and improve team efficiency.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Booker Prize for fiction shortlist for 2024, announced on Monday, featured the largest-ever number of women authors in its 55-year history as well as its first Dutch author.</p>

<p>Five women and one man are in the running for the prestigious literary prize, from a longlist of 13 authors. They include writers from Australia, the Netherlands, Britain, Canada and the US.</p>

<p>English pottery maker, author and chair of the judges Edmund de Waal said the shortlist comprised "books that made us want to keep on reading, to ring up friends and tell them about them, novels that inspired us to write, to score music, and even - in my case - to go back to my wheel and make pots".</p>

<p>Among them is the spy novel "Creation Lake" by American Rachel Kushner, who was shortlisted in 2018 as well.</p>

<p>Set in a remote outpost in France, the book follows an American secret agent whose mission is to infiltrate a group of radical eco-activists.</p>

<p>British author Samantha Harvey, previously longlisted in 2009, made the cut this year with "Orbital", which follows six astronauts on the International Space Station (ISS).</p>

<p>Yael van der Wouden is the first Dutch author to be shortlisted with her debut novel, "The Safekeep", a family drama set in the Netherlands 15 years after the end of the Second World War.</p>

<p>The other authors on the shortlist are American Percival Everett for the novel "James", Canadian Anne Michaels for "Held", and Australian Charlotte Wood for "Stone Yard Devotional".</p>

<p>The Booker is open to works of fiction by writers of any nationality, written in English and published in the UK or Ireland between October 1, 2023 and September 30, 2024.</p>

<p>The Booker Prize ceremony will take place on November 12. Each of the shortlisted authors will receive 2,500 Pounds, and the winner will get &amp; 50,000 Pounds.</p>

<p>Last year's winner was Irish author Paul Lynch and his dystopian novel Prophet Song.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Authorities on Monday charged a man suspected of plotting to assassinate Donald Trump with federal gun crimes.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Authorities on Monday charged a man suspected of plotting to assassinate Donald Trump with federal gun crimes.</p>

<p>Here are five things to know about the weekend incident, where the Secret Service discovered the gunman on Trump's Florida golf course.</p>

<h3><strong>What happened?&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>At approximately 1:30 pm (1730 GMT) on Sunday, a US Secret Service agent noticed the barrel of a rifle pointing out of shrubbery on the Trump International Golf Course in West Palm Beach.</p>

<p>Agents, who were deployed in a moving security bubble one or two holes ahead of the former president, "engaged" the individual, the Secret Service's Rafael Barros said, with the suspect fleeing.</p>

<p>The gunman did not "fire or get off any shots," Secret Service acting director Ronald Rowe told reporters Monday, adding that he had no clear line of sight on the former president at the time of the confrontation.</p>

<p>Police recovered a loaded semi-automatic rifle equipped with a scope, two backpacks, and a GoPro video camera from the scene, according to the criminal complaint submitted Monday.</p>

<p>The gunman was "between 300 and 500 yards (meters)" away from Trump when he was discovered, Sheriff Ric Bradshaw said.</p>

<p>"With a rifle and a scope like that, that's not a long distance," said Bradshaw.</p>

<h3><strong>The arrest&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>About 45 minutes later, police apprehended a suspect after receiving information from a witness who reported a man fleeing in a black vehicle.</p>

<p>It was identified by its registration information and spotted on the I-95 highway as it entered adjacent Martin County.</p>

<p>Authorities pulled over the car -- whose tags belonged to a different, stolen, vehicle -- and detained the suspect.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Phone records showed he had been waiting in the shrubbery overnight, according to the criminal complaint.</p>

<h3><strong>Who is the suspect?</strong></h3>

<p>Police identified the would-be attacker as Ryan Wesley Routh, whom AFP interviewed in Kyiv in 2022, where he had travelled to support the war effort against Russia.</p>

<p>Amid claims Routh is registered as a Republican or a Democratic voter, public records indicate he is currently neither.</p>

<p>Scattered social media posts on Routh's since-suspended X account show his political opinions shifting over time, with support shown for both Trump and President Joe Biden.</p>

<p>In several posts earlier this year, Routh called for a Republican presidential ticket featuring entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy and former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley. He most recently cast an in-person ballot during the 2024 Democratic primary.</p>

<p>Routh, 58, is reportedly a builder based in Hawaii, with an arrest record spanning decades and several states.</p>

<p>He regularly posted about politics and current events on social media, including criticism of Trump, US media said.</p>

<h3><strong>Tense election&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>The incident appeared to be the second assassination attempt on Trump, after an attack at a rally in July that left him slightly wounded in his right ear, with one rally attendee killed.</p>

<p>Since then, Trump has moved most campaign events indoors and addresses audiences from behind a bulletproof screen.&nbsp;</p>

<p>His Democratic rival Kamala Harris has also taken to speaking from behind a screen.</p>

<p>Trump's political rhetoric has always been aggressive, but his 2024 campaign has increased the temperature, with a focus on the hot-button issue of immigration.</p>

<p>Last week, the Ohio town of Springfield saw bomb threats called in after Trump riled his base against the town's 15,000 Haitian migrant residents, falsely accusing them of eating people's pets.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Secret Service in crosshairs</strong></h3>

<p>Sunday's drama brings the spotlight back on the US Secret Service, which is tasked with the security of sitting and former US presidents.</p>

<p>The July rally attack on Trump raised questions about the Secret Service's competence and led to the resignation of the agency's director.</p>

<p>In Florida, the Secret Service had not secured the whole golf course, focusing on a zone around the president, Sheriff Bradshaw said.</p>

<p>"He's not the sitting president. If he was, we would have had this entire golf course surrounded," he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"But because he's not, security is limited to the areas that the Secret Service deems possible."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Biden called for Congress to authorize more personnel for the agency.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Social media users are variously claiming the man accused of planning to assassinate Donald Trump in Florida is registered as a Republican or a Democratic voter, but public records indicate he is currently neither.</p>

<p>Numerous posts tying the alleged plot to political parties ricocheted across platforms after Ryan Wesley Routh was foiled Sunday when a Secret Service agent spotted his rifle protruding from bushes while the former US president was playing golf nearby.</p>

<p>Many claims centred on Routh, 58, saying in one 2020 post that Trump was his "choice" in 2016 but had disappointed him as president, adding: "I will be glad when you gone (sic)."</p>

<p>However, Patrick Gannon, public information director for the North Carolina State Board of Elections, told AFP that Routh requested an absentee ballot in 2016, but did not actually vote.</p>

<p>Data from North Carolina shows Routh -- a self-employed builder now based in Hawaii with a decades-long arrest record -- is actively registered as an unaffiliated, or independent, voter in the swing state. He most recently cast an in-person ballot during the 2024 Democratic primary.</p>

<p>Routh was removed from the rolls in 2003 following a felony conviction, re-registered in 2005 as an unaffiliated voter, but was removed again in 2010 after another felony conviction, Gannon said.</p>

<p>In 2012, Routh submitted his current registration as unaffiliated.</p>

<p>In a book he self-published in 2023 about the war in Ukraine, Routh maintained he was politically independent.</p>

<p>"I get so tired of people asking me if I am a Democrat or Republican as I refuse to be put in a category and I must always answer independent," he wrote.</p>

<p>Scattered social media posts on Routh's since-suspended X account show his political opinions shifting over time, with support shown for both Trump and President Joe Biden, as well as Bernie Sanders and Tulsi Gabbard, a former Democratic congresswoman turned Trump adviser.</p>

<p>In several posts earlier this year, Routh called for a Republican presidential ticket featuring entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy and former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley.</p>

<p>He has also posted fervently about his support for Ukraine's fight against Russia's invasion, and in 2022 was interviewed by AFP while demonstrating in Kyiv.</p>

<p>AFP photos from his Hawaii home show a Biden-Harris bumper sticker -- the decal Biden used before dropping out of the race -- on the back of a truck in the driveway.</p>

<p>Electoral information indicates he is a registered voter in Hawaii, as well as North Carolina.</p>

<p>A spokesperson for the City and County of Honolulu said Routh was registered there and that his status is active. The authorities do not collect information on voters' party affiliation, the official added.</p>

<p>Federal Election Commission data shows various small-dollar donations from a Ryan Routh in Hawaii to 2020 Democratic presidential candidates including Gabbard, Andrew Yang, Elizabeth Warren, Tom Steyer and Beto O'Rourke.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A senior US diplomat on Monday denounced "vile and racist attacks" on Indian Americans after derogatory remarks were made recently about Vice President Kamala Harris's origins.</p>

<p>In a rare remark touching on domestic US politics, Richard Verma, the deputy secretary of state in charge of management issues, did not directly mention the attacks on the Democratic presidential candidate, but his allusion was clear.</p>

<p>"Nothing could be more threatening or damaging to US-Indian ties than the recent demonization of immigrants we've seen careening through cyberspace and on our TV screens in recent days, which includes vile and racist attacks directed at Indian Americans," Verma, himself an Indian American, said at the Hudson Institute think tank.</p>

<p>"Let me be as clear as I possibly can -- this kind of language, these kinds of attacks, have no place in American society, and we have to reject them outright," he said.</p>

<p>Verma, a former US ambassador to India, was delivering an address on relations between the world's two largest democracies, which he said both historically have advocated "social justice for our most vulnerable populations."</p>

<p>Far-right conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer, who has been travelling with Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, recently wrote on social media that Harris would make the White House "smell like curry" if she won November's election.</p>

<p>Loomer's closeness with Trump has drawn fire even from some hard-right Republicans. Trump has insisted that he does not control her comments and was unaware that she has spread September 11 conspiracy theories.</p>

<p>Harris, whose mother was born in India and father in Jamaica, would be the first US president of South Asian heritage and the first woman president if elected on November 5.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p dir="ltr">Ryan Wesley Routh fled the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Florida, after Secret Service agents fired at him upon spotting the muzzle of his rifle through a chain-link fence. The incident occurred about 300 yards from the former President's location on the golf course.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Routh didn't get away for long, though. A witness provided a photo of his vehicle to authorities, which led to his arrest. Martin County Sheriff Will Snyder explained that Routh was caught near the Palm City exit 714 on I-95. Mr Snyder noted that Routh was "smart" and "just driving with the flow of traffic," which might have led him to believe he had evaded capture, Fox News reported.</p>

<p dir="ltr">During the arrest, authorities surrounded Routh's vehicle and forced it to stop after coordinating resources over a two-mile stretch. Following his arrest, Routh appeared in federal court in West Palm Beach, Florida, facing charges of possession of a firearm as a convicted felon and possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number. He also faces potential additional federal charges.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US Secret Service was facing renewed scrutiny on Monday after a second assassination attempt against former president Donald Trump in two months.</p>

<p>President Joe Biden, responding to the latest attack on the Republican White House candidate, said the agency charged with protecting high-profile officials "needs more help."</p>

<p>The Secret Service has been reeling since a gunman's bullet grazed the 78-year-old Trump's ear during a July 13 campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>Secret Service director Kimberly Cheatle resigned 10 days later, acknowledging that the agency had "failed" its protective mission.</p>

<p>At least five Secret Service agents have reportedly been placed on leave pending the completion of an internal Secret Service review of security lapses.</p>

<p>Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said the review will examine measures needed to ensure the agency's "no-fail mission of protecting national leaders."</p>

<p>The 20-year-old Butler gunman, who was perched on the roof of a nearby building with a clear sight line of the stage, opened fire on Trump with an AR-style rifle just minutes after the former president began to speak.</p>

<p>He was shot dead by a Secret Service sniper within 15 seconds of firing the first of eight shots.</p>

<p>On Sunday, the Secret Service thwarted another apparent attempt to shoot the former president -- this time while he was playing golf at his course in West Palm Beach, Florida.</p>

<p>According to acting Secret Service director Ronald Rowe, an agent saw the would-be assassin armed with a rifle on the perimeter of the Trump International Golf Course.</p>

<p>The agent opened fire and the alleged assailant, later identified as Ryan Wesley Routh, 58, fled in a vehicle.</p>

<p>Routh did not fire any shots and never had a clear sight line of the former president, Rowe said.</p>

<p>Routh was arrested 45 minutes later and charged with gun crimes at a first court appearance on Monday.</p>

<h3><strong>'Up their level of protection'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Trump thanked the Secret Service for thwarting Sunday's attack but some of his Republican allies called for the agency to ramp up its protective detail for the former president.</p>

<p>"There have been TWO attempts on Trump's life," said Steve Scalise, the Republican House Majority leader. "Secret Service must up their level of protection of him to their FULL capabilities -- including expanding the perimeter."</p>

<p>Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw defended the Secret Service's response, stating that if Trump had been the current president "we would have had this entire golf course surrounded."</p>

<p>"But because he's not, security is limited to the areas that the Secret Service deems possible," he said. "The Secret Service did exactly what they should have done. They provided exactly what the protection should have been."</p>

<p>Rowe said Biden, following the Butler attack, had ordered the "highest levels of protection" for Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee.</p>

<p>He said the service was operating in a "heightened and dynamic threat environment" and stressed that it "cannot have failures."</p>

<p>The Secret Service provides lifelong protection for current and former presidents and vice presidents, their families and the children of former presidents up to the age of 16.</p>

<p>Its agents also provide security for foreign heads of state and government on official visits to the United States, or for major national or international events.</p>

<p>Originally set up to combat counterfeit currencies, the agency was entrusted with protecting senior US leaders and their families following the assassination of President William McKinley in 1901.</p>

<p>To this day, the Secret Service continues to play a role in protecting the US financial system, including by investigating counterfeit money and digital fraud.</p>

<p>The agency has over 6,500 personnel, about half of whom are special agents, famous for their dark glasses, suits, earpieces and serious expressions.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A US tribunal began picking over the bitter spat between media magnate Rupert Murdoch and his children Monday in a case that could determine the fate of his empire, including the influential right-wing Fox News.</p>

<p>The hearings in Nevada are playing out behind closed doors despite a bid by an alliance of media outlets, including the New York Times, which first reported details of the judicial battle, for access to proceedings.</p>

<p>Murdoch, 93, is in the eye of a legal storm as several of his children seek to block him from changing the terms of a family trust to ensure his favoured son Lachlan gains control of his sprawling media assets after his death.</p>

<p>It's a plot worthy of the hit fictional TV series "Succession," in part inspired by the Murdoch family, in which a billionaire mogul fights his children over his empire's future.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In Nevada, Murdoch's children James, Prudence and Elisabeth are bitterly opposing changes that would dilute their formerly equal eventual control of Murdoch's companies.</p>

<p>Amid a heavy security presence, Murdoch, who wore a blue spotted tie and held hands with his new wife Elena Zhukova, 67, smiled and shook his head as he entered the collonaded tribunal, TV images showed.</p>

<h3><strong>Family feud sensation&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Observers warn the legal battle will have profound consequences for Murdoch's empire -- which transformed tabloid newspapers, cable TV and satellite broadcasting across multiple countries, but also faces accusations of stoking populism across the English-speaking world.</p>

<p>Critics credit Brexit in Britain and the rise of former US president Donald Trump at least partly to Murdoch and his outlets.</p>

<p>Lachlan is reportedly more aligned with his father's deeply conservative worldview and took the reins of News Corp and Fox Corporation in the fall of 2023.</p>

<p>His three siblings are said to be more politically centrist.</p>

<p>In a sign of the schism, James, who stood down from News Corp in 2020, has come out in support of Democrat Kamala Harris, facing off against Republican Trump in this year's presidential election.</p>

<p>Rupert Murdoch's lawyers argue he "is trying to protect James, Elisabeth and Prudence by ensuring that they won't be able to moderate Fox's politics or disrupt its operations with constant fights over leadership," according to the New York Times, which accessed court documents.</p>

<p>In a preliminary ruling, the probate tribunal did not oppose a change to the trust in Lachlan's favor, but will nonetheless hear arguments from all sides this week. It will then make recommendations.</p>

<p>News Corp, with revenues of $10 billion in 2023, is a dominating force in publishing through HarperCollins, in US newspapers with the Wall Street Journal and New York Post, and in Britain's cutthroat print market with The Sun and The Times.</p>

<p>Fox Corporation is the parent company of Fox News.</p>

<p>Following the 2020 election, the conservative TV network agreed to pay Dominion Voting Systems nearly $800 million after the voting machine company sued it for airing false claims that it rigged the vote against Trump.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A patient with a degenerative disease was able to command Amazon's Alexa digital assistant with his mind, the company behind the technological innovation announced Monday, letting him stream shows and control devices with only his thoughts.</p>

<p>An implant in a blood vessel on the surface of the 64-year-old man's brain let him mentally "tap" icons on an Amazon Fire tablet, brain-computer interface company Synchron said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The patient, who is living with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), was able to make video calls, play music, stream shows, control smart home devices such as lights, shop online, and read books by using his mind to direct Alexa, according to the New York-based company.</p>

<p>ALS is a degenerative nerve disease that leads to muscle weakness and paralysis.</p>

<p>"To be able to manage important aspects of my environment and control access to entertainment gives me back the independence that I'm losing," the patient, named only as Mark, said in a release.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The test was intended to show how customers could use just their minds to control smart homes with Alexa-compatible devices such as door cameras, plugs, and thermostats, according to the company.</p>

<p>"While many smart home systems rely on voice or touch, we are sending control signals directly from the brain," Synchron founder and chief executive Tom Oxley said in the release.</p>

<p>"Patients can interact with devices in their home hands and voice-free, using only their thoughts."</p>

<p>Several companies, including Elon Musk's Neuralink, are working on connecting brains with computers.</p>

<p>Neuralink in January installed a brain implant in a man paralyzed after a diving accident. Musk, who also owns Tesla and X, touted the implant as a success.</p>

<p>In July he said his startup is "moving on" to a second test patient as its tech improves.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar said on Monday the Palestinian group was prepared for prolonged fighting against Israel, in a message to Yemen's Iran-backed Huthi rebels nearly a year into the Gaza war.</p>

<p>"We have prepared ourselves to fight a long war of attrition that will break the enemy's political will," the Hamas leader said, asserting that the militants in Gaza and allied Iran-aligned groups in Iraq, Lebanon and Yemen would defeat Israel.</p>

<p>The message followed a rare missile attack on central Israel on Sunday claimed by the Houthis, who control the Yemeni capital Sanaa and much of the country's Red Sea coast.</p>

<p>The attack caused no casualties but sparked vows of retaliation from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.</p>

<p>Sinwar said in the message addressed to Huthi leader Abdul Malik al-Huthi: "I congratulate you on your success in sending your missiles deep into the enemy entity, bypassing all layers and defence and interception systems."</p>

<p>The Houthis said they had "penetrated" Israel's air defences, while Israel said the missile likely fragmented mid-air but was not destroyed.</p>

<p>"Our combined efforts with you" and with groups in Lebanon and Iraq "will break this enemy and inflict defeat on it," Sinwar added.</p>

<p>Since November the Houthis have targeted Israel and its perceived interests in stated solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza, launching dozens of missile and drone strikes that have disrupted global shipping through vital waterways off Yemen.</p>

<p>The Houthis are fighting Israel as part of Iran's so-called "axis of resistance", which includes Hamas, Lebanon's Hezbollah and Several Iraqi Shiite Muslim groups.</p>

<p>In July, a Houthi drone strike killed a civilian in Tel Aviv, at least 1,800 kilometres (about 1,120 miles) from Yemen.</p>

<p>It prompted retaliatory strikes that caused significant damage and deaths at Yemen's rebel-controlled Hodeida port.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump launched a fierce attack on his Democrat rival Kamala Harris hours after a second assassination attempt on him. Trump was at his Florida golf course on Monday morning when Secret Service agents caught a suspect and found an AK-47 rifle in the nearby bushes. Suspect Ryan Routh has been charged with illegal possession of firearms, but officials clarified he did not fire any shot.</p>

<p>Trump blamed Harris - whom he referred to as "Comrade" - for propagating "Communist Left rhetoric", which he said has worsened the political culture in the US. He accused her of lying at the recent "highly partisan" ABC debate - though the US media had pointed out it was Trump who resorted to falsehoods during the debate.</p>

<p>"The Rhetoric, Lies, as exemplified by the false statements made by Comrade Kamala Harris during the rigged and highly partisan ABC Debate, and all of the ridiculous lawsuits specifically designed to inflict damage on Joe's, then Kamala's, Political Opponent, ME, has taken politics in our Country to a whole new level of Hatred, Abuse, and Distrust. Because of this Communist Left Rhetoric, the bullets are flying, and it will only get worse," asserted the former president who had survived another assassination attempt with a bloodied ear in Pennsylvania in July.</p>

<p>He also reiterated his demands to deport illegal immigrants and allow only those who come on the basis of merit. "Allowing millions of people, from places unknown, to invade and take over our Country, is an unpardonable sin. Our borders must be closed, and the terrorists, criminals, and mentally insane, immediately removed from American cities and towns, deported back to their counties of origin," he said.</p>

<p>Reacting to the assassination attempt, Harris had said she was "glad" that Trump was safe and that violence has no place in America.</p>

<p>Trump's running mate JD Vance too criticised her after the Monday morning incident. In an online post, he claimed Harris' allies have repeatedly called for Trump to be eliminated.</p>

<p>"Kamala Harris has said that "Democracy is on the line" in her race against President Trump. The gunman agreed, and used the exact same phrase. He had a Kamala Harris bumper sticker on his truck... he donated 19 times to Democrat causes and zero to Republican ones," said Vance on X.</p>

<p>He said that for years, Kamala Harris's "campaign surrogates" have said things like "Trump has to be eliminated," and targeted the US media for "double standard" on the coverage of the incident.</p>

<p>"The double standard is breathtaking. Donald Trump and I are, by their account, directly responsible for bomb threats from foreign countries. Why? Because we had the audacity to repeat what residents told us about the problems in their town. Meanwhile, Harris allies call for Trump to be eliminated as the media publishes arguments that he deserved to be shot," said Vance.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United Nations (UN) announced on Monday that the Taliban has suspended all polio vaccination campaigns in Afghanistan.</p>

<p>UN agencies said that they were notified about the suspension just days before the scheduled September immunisation campaign, though no official reason was provided.</p>

<p>Representatives from the Taliban-led government did not comment on the situation immediately.</p>

<p>Afghanistan and Pakistan remain the only two countries in the world where the spread of the paralysing and potentially fatal disease has not been eradicated.</p>

<p>Despite the polio eradication programme's continuous efforts in Afghanistan, the last phase of the campaign to achieve polio-free status has faced significant challenges.</p>

<p>Over the past three years, the number of polio cases have risen in the country, with the virus spreading to provinces that had remained free of the disease for an extended period.</p>

<p>UNICEF, in collaboration with the Ministry of Public Health (MoPH), the World Health Organization (WHO), and various non-governmental organisations, has been working through the Emergency Operating Centre (EOC) to explore innovative methods to ensure every child is reached with vaccines.</p>

<p>The focus was also on building trust and demand for vaccination campaigns among the population.</p>

<p>So far, 16 Afghan provinces have been affected, with a total of 56 cases of Wild Poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) reported.</p>

<p>The southern region of Afghanistan remains the most severely impacted, accounting for 66 per cent of the country's total polio cases in 2020.</p>

<p>Despite the ongoing challenges, the polio programme has ensured 100% adequacy of vaccine supplies for all polio-related activities, including immunisation campaigns, case responses, and the deployment of Permanent and Temporary Teams (PTT).</p>

<p>The successful introduction of vaccines such as mOPV2, mOPV1, and tOPV for case response campaigns has been made possible through capacity building in vaccine management and accountability.</p>

<p>Even during the Covid-19 pandemic, the polio programme managed to conduct three National Immunisation Days, two Sub-National Immunisation Days, and three Case Response Campaigns across Afghanistan.</p>

<p>However, the current suspension by the Taliban adds uncertainty to future vaccination efforts, raising concerns about the ongoing fight to eliminate polio in the country.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As US Vice President Kamala Harris prepares to take the stage against former President Donald Trump in her White House bid in November, her secret weapon seems to be a high-powered lawyer with a surprising side gig - defending Google in a landmark antitrust trial that could reshape the tech giant's future.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Karen Dunn, a partner at the prestigious Paul, Weiss law firm, has been tapped by Harris to coach her for her campaign. Dunn had allegedly prepared Harris for her first debate of the 2024 US elections, against Trump. But while Dunn is busy prepping the VP for the debate, she's also leading Google's defense in a blockbuster case brought by the Joe Biden administration alleging the company illegally monopolized the online advertising market.</p>

<p>Dunn's dual roles have raised eyebrows among antitrust experts who worry her close ties to the Harris camp could undermine the government's aggressive pursuit of Google. They argue it's an "outrageous" conflict of interest for the Vice President to be taking advice from a lawyer representing a company her own administration is suing.</p>

<p>"It's clear that you can't serve both sides," said Matt Stoller of the American Economic Liberties Project to the New York Times. "If these were legal cases, she would be ethically barred from doing what she's doing," he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dunn, who has prepped Democratic candidates for debates since 2008, delivered Google's opening statement in the high-stakes trial on Monday, September 9, two days prior to the most anticipated presidential debate ahead of the US polls, since Biden quit the presidential race. Hours later, on the very same day, Dunn rushed out of the Virginia courtroom to join Harris' team in Pittsburgh as they put the finishing touches on her debate prep.</p>

<p>The 48-year-old litigator is no stranger to the revolving door between Big Law and Democratic politics. She started as a legislative correspondent on Capitol Hill for Representative Nita Lowey of New York. She was next hired as the second employee on Hilary Clinton's 2000 Senate campaign in 1999, with whom she worked during and after the September 11 terrorist attacks as well. She then briefly left politics to attend Yale Law School. But, by 2008, she was back to working on the presidential campaign with Clinton, and then later, with Barrack Obama.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"It's a combination of tough love," said Hillary Clinton of Karen Dunn in an interview earlier this month. "She is someone who as a lawyer sweats the details, but she has an ability in her communications work to see the big picture, and that's really a rare quality," Clinton added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dunn's represented tech giants such as Apple and Uber and even helped prepare Amazon founder Jeff Bezos for a congressional hearing. In 2021, she won a landmark lawsuit against organizers of the 2017 Charlottesville far-right rally.</p>

<p>But Dunn's current juggling act may be her most high-profile yet. As she argues Google's case in court, her advice to Harris had an instrumental role in shaping the outcome of a debate that has been pivotal in the 2024 race. And with the Department Of Justice seeking a breakup of Google's ad business, the stakes couldn't be higher.</p>

<p>"One imagines her stature in Harris' world has only gone up after the debate - which could be concerning if she's ever negotiating a potential settlement with the Justice Department under Harris," said Jeff Hauser of the Revolving Door Project.</p>

<p>The Republicans have already seized on the controversy, with a top Trump adviser blasting it as proof Harris will "never stand up to Big Tech." House Republicans are demanding answers from Attorney General Merrick Garland on how he's combating potential conflicts of interest.</p>

<p>Neither Google nor the Harris campaign have commented on the issue so far.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As of now, Dunn shows no signs of slowing down. As she told the New York Times in 2019, the key to a winning debate moment is engaging your opponent in a way that challenges them, and then creating a winning moment, preferably at the expense of someone else. With her dual roles, Dunn's on the verge of challenging the boundaries of what's acceptable in the world of high-stakes politics and la</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Climate activist Greta Thunberg recently made headlines after being labelled "Antisemite of the Week" by the Jewish watchdog group StopAntisemitism, following her arrest at an anti-Israel rally. The group criticized Thunberg for aligning with protesters who oppose Israel, accusing her of turning her activism into a platform for anti-Semitism, the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/09/15/us-news/greta-thunberg-named-antisemite-of-the-week-by-jewish-advocacy-group/" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>New York Post </em></a>reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"She has sadly transformed her activism into a platform for vile Jew-hatred," the organization added.</p>

<p>Ms Thunberg, 21, was arrested on September 4 while demonstrating with Students Against the Occupation, who called on Copenhagen University to cut ties with Israel, including climate change programs. StopAntisemitism founder Liora Rez condemned Thunberg, accusing her of prioritizing hatred for Israel over environmental activism, despite Israel's efforts in climate action.</p>

<p>"Sadly, Greta's hatred of the world's only Jewish nation eclipses her love of the environment. Despite Israel being a global leader in tackling climate disasters and rushing to aid in crises worldwide, Greta sides with their homicidal terrorist enemies," founder Liora Rez said in a statement.</p>

<p>"Her actions speak louder than her words. She claims to care about the future of humanity but Greta's hypocrisy is on full display as she's been active in championing Hamas leaders who openly call for genocide."</p>

<p>Thunberg, who had previously participated in other anti-Israel demonstrations, also faced backlash for holding a sign that some interpreted as using antisemitic imagery. Thunberg later removed the image and explained that the toy octopus in the photo was a communication tool used by autistic people, denying any antisemitic intent.</p>

<p>"The toy in the picture is a tool often used by autistic people to communicate feelings," she said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>China and Russia are concerned about the strengthening India-US relationship because it promotes inclusivity, peace, and the peaceful resolution of disputes, along with valuing diverse voices in society, a top US diplomat said Monday.</p>

<p>"Frankly, why do you think China and Russia are so concerned about this partnership? Because we bring a way of life to the rest of the world, that is about inclusivity, about peace, about the peaceful resolution of disputes, about the rule of law, and it's about hearing everyone's voice in a society," Richard Verma, the Deputy Secretary of State for Management and Resources said at the prestigious Hudson Institute, in response to a question, after he delivered remarks on India-US relationship.</p>

<p>Mr Verma said the relationship between India and US is "a very different mode" than how some of the adversaries of the latter operate.</p>

<p>The diplomat noted that this uniqueness is why President Joe Biden has described the relationship between both countries as the "defining relationship of this century".</p>

<p>He recalled that nearly 20 years ago, when he stood with then-Senator Biden and staff director Tony Blinken in the Senate, Biden had remarked that if the US and India were the closest friends and partners by 2020, the world would be a safer place.</p>

<p>"Not just because we have two big militaries, not just because we have two big economies, but because we actually stand for something that matters to people in their daily lives across the world,” Mr Verma said.</p>

<p>In response to a question on QUAD, Mr Verma said it aims to promote peace, security, stability and prosperity.</p>

<p>"I look at what the Quad has, the kinds of statements and pronouncements it's made on technology, for example …technology for good, not to harass, not to surveil, not to misinform, laying out a set of key principles, going even further on some of our work on quantum computing and cybersecurity,” he said.</p>

<p>"When I look at what the Quad has said and done on energy transition, trade, rule-based order, I don't think it has to take on a military character. Indians are not supportive of that. Frankly, I don't think we need that. I think there are other venues to deal with core military issues,” he said.</p>

<p>"I think this is about like-minded countries, two of which are treaty allies of the United States, coming together in a different form, in a different architecture, bringing in the most populous country in the Indo-Pacific to actually chart some new territory that we hadn't charted before," Verma said.</p>

<p>"I think it has positive impact to security without being a treaty-based security organisation. There's great promise and excitement in the QUAD. I think this weekend's meeting will be quite significant. It'll be historic. QUAD will continue to just build in many ways,” said the top American diplomat.</p>

<p>US President Joe Biden will host the fourth in-person Quad leaders summit at his Delaware residence next week, in a rare gesture for his counterparts from Australia, India and Japan, a presidential spokesperson announced Thursday.</p>

<p>India, which was scheduled to host QUAD this year, would host the summit next year. QUAD leadership summit is an initiative of Biden and is one of the key foreign policy legacies for the outgoing American president.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Infections of drug-resistant superbugs are projected to kill nearly 40 million people over the next 25 years, a global analysis predicted on Monday, as the researchers called for action to avoid this grim scenario.</p>

<p>Superbugs -- strains of bacteria or pathogens that have become resistant to antibiotics, making them much harder to treat -- have been recognised as a rising threat to global health.</p>

<p>The analysis has been billed as the first research to track the global impact of superbugs over time, and estimate what could happen next.</p>

<p>More than a million people died from the superbugs -- also called antimicrobial resistance (AMR) -- a year across the world between 1990 and 2021, according to the study in The Lancet journal.</p>

<p>Deaths among children under five from superbugs actually fell by more than 50 percent over the last three decades, the study said, due to improving measures to prevent and control infections for infants.</p>

<p>However when children now catch superbugs, the infections are much harder to treat.</p>

<p>And deaths of over-70s have surged by more than 80 percent over the same period, as an ageing population became more vulnerable to infection.</p>

<p>Deaths from infections of MRSA, a type of staph bacteria that has become resistant to many antibiotics, doubled to 130,000 in 2021 from three decades earlier, the study said.</p>

<h3><strong>'This threat is growing'</strong></h3>

<p>The researchers used modelling to estimate that -- based on current trends -- the number of direct deaths from AMR would rise by 67 percent to reach nearly two million a year by 2050.</p>

<p>It will also play a role in a further 8.2 million annual deaths, a jump of nearly 75 percent, according to the modelling.</p>

<p>Under this scenario, AMR will have directly killed 39 million people over the next quarter century, and contributed to a total of 169 million deaths, it added.</p>

<p>But less dire scenarios are also possible.</p>

<p>If the world works to improve care for severe infections and access to antimicrobial drugs, it could save the lives of 92 million people by 2050, the modelling suggested.</p>

<p>"These findings highlight that AMR has been a significant global health threat for decades and that this threat is growing," study co-author Mohsen Naghavi of the US-based Institute of Health Metrics said in a statement.</p>

<p>The researchers looked at 22 pathogens, 84 combinations of drugs and pathogens, and 11 infectious syndromes such as meningitis. The study involved data from 520 million individual records across 204 countries and territories.</p>

<p>It was released ahead of a high-level AMR meeting at the United Nations scheduled for September 26.</p>

<p>Antimicrobial resistance is a natural phenomenon, but the overuse and misuse of antibiotics in humans, animals and plants has made the problem worse.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced an expansion of the country's war goals on Tuesday to include the return of northern residents who fled cross-border fire traded with Hamas ally Hezbollah.</p>

<p>"The political-security cabinet updated the goals of the war this evening, so that they include the following section: the safe return of the residents of the north to their homes," Netanyahu's office said in a statement.</p>

<p>Israeli forces and the Iran-backed Lebanese armed group have exchanged near-daily strikes since Hamas's October 7 attack sparked war in the Gaza Strip.</p>

<p>Hezbollah says the campaign is in support of its Palestinian ally.</p>

<p>Hezbollah officials have said the group would stand down if a Gaza ceasefire was reached, while Israel insists it cannot allow militants to remain in the border area in Lebanon's south.</p>

<p>The violence has killed hundreds of mostly fighters in Lebanon, and dozens of civilians and soldiers on the Israeli side.</p>

<p>The fighting has also forced tens of thousands of people on both sides to flee their homes.</p>

<p>On Monday, Israel's Defence Minister Yoav Gallant told a visiting US envoy that "military action" was the "only way left to ensure the return of Israel's northern communities to their homes".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

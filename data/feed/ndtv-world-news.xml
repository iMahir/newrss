       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Four people were killed and three others injured in a shooting at a home in Kentucky in the US on Saturday, police said. According to the Florence Police Department, four individuals were declared dead at the location, while three others were taken to a nearby hospital and are currently in critical but stable condition.</p>

<p>Officers responded to the residence at nearly 3 am on Saturday and as they approached the home, they still heard shots being fired, Police Chief Jeff Mallery said at a press conference. People were attending a birthday pool party at that time.</p>

<p>The suspect, described as an adult male, fled the scene in a vehicle prior to police arrival, leading to a police chase. The suspect then drove off the road and crashed into a ditch. Law enforcement found the suspect with a self-inflicted gunshot wound. He was transported to a nearby hospital, where he was later pronounced dead, Xinhua news agency reported.</p>

<p>Party attendees recognised the suspect and provided his identity to the police. According to Mallery, he had a prior conviction for a sexual offence, though it does not appear to be connected to the shooting.</p>

<p>Officials said that an initial investigation indicated the suspect acted alone, and there was no danger to the public.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Joe Biden's presidential reelection bid hung in the balance Saturday after his latest efforts to put a disastrous debate showing behind him failed to silence voices urging him to quit the White House race.</p>

<p>Murmurs of dissent within his own Democratic Party have -- in the case of five individual House representatives -- morphed into direct calls for him to drop out. And a number of key donors have threatened to cut off funding if Biden insists on staying the course.</p>

<p>"I do not believe that the President can effectively campaign and win against Donald Trump," Angie Craig, the latest House Democrat to break ranks, said Saturday.</p>

<p>The House minority leader, Hakeem Jeffries, has scheduled a virtual meeting of senior Democrat representatives for Sunday to discuss the best way forward, and Democrat Senator Mark Warner is reportedly working to convene a similar forum in the upper chamber.</p>

<p>In what had been billed as a make-or-break TV interview on Friday, Biden's strategy was to flatly deny the falling poll numbers and concerns over his mental and physical fitness triggered by his dismal performance against rival Donald Trump.</p>

<p>He blamed a severe cold for the debate debacle and insisted it was just a "bad night" rather than evidence of increasing frailty and cognitive decline. And the 81-year-old was adamant that he would not be pressured to end his campaign.</p>

<p>"If the Lord Almighty came down and said, 'Joe, get out of the race,' I'd get out of the race," he said. "But the Lord Almighty is not coming down."</p>

<p>Calls for less divine intervention do, however, appear to be strengthening.</p>

<h3><strong>Internal dissent</strong></h3>

<p>Biden's campaign team is pushing ahead regardless, with two events planned in Pennsylvania on Sunday and visits to other battleground states later in the month.</p>

<p>At a rally in Wisconsin before Friday's interview, Biden had delivered a forceful, energetic stump speech, unequivocally declaring, "I'm staying in the race. I'll beat Donald Trump."</p>

<p>Then came the sit-down with the ABC network that appeared unlikely to soothe the concerns of critics who say that -- away from a teleprompter -- Biden can struggle to communicate.</p>

<p>Some of his answers were tentative, meandering and difficult to follow, even as he sought to deflect questions about his mental acuity and dismissed the notion that his party would consider replacing him.</p>

<p>The Biden campaign had another small fire to put out Saturday after it emerged that the White House had provided the questions for interviews the president gave to two Black radio stations on Friday.</p>

<h3><strong>Out of touch?</strong></h3>

<p>Democratic strategist David Axelrod suggested in a CNN op-ed that Biden is engaged in "Denial. Delusion. Defiance."</p>

<p>"The stakes are as great as Biden describes. And if he believes it, as I think he does, he will eventually do what duty and love of country requires, and step aside," Axelrod wrote in the piece published Saturday.</p>

<p>"If he does not, it will be Biden's age, and not Trump's moral and ethical void, that will dominate the rest of this most important campaign and sully the president's historic legacy."</p>

<p>Trump, meanwhile, sarcastically suggested Biden should "ignore his many critics and move forward, with alacrity and strength."</p>

<p>"He should be sharp, precise and energetic, just like he was in The Debate," the Republican challenger said in a social media post Saturday.</p>

<p>For now, Democrats are largely keeping a lid on any simmering discontent with their leader -- at least in public.</p>

<p>But with election day just four months away, any move to replace Biden as nominee would need to be made sooner rather than later, and the meetings of top Congressional Democrats in coming days will be scrutinized for any signs of more open rebellion.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, for Biden and his campaign team, the strategy seems to be to ride it out.</p>

<p>His next major test will be a press conference scheduled for Thursday during the NATO leaders' summit in Washington.</p>

<p>When pressed in the ABC interview on why he doesn't take an independent neurological exam, Biden argued that the role of US president meant being subjected to constant mental assessment.</p>

<p>"I have a cognitive test every single day," he said. "Not only am I campaigning, I'm running the world."&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The NASA astronaut knocks loudly three times on a what appears to be a nondescript door, and calls cheerfully: "You ready to come out?"</p>

<p>The reply is inaudible, but beneath his mask he appears to be grinning as he yanks the door open -- and four scientists who have spent a year away from all other human contact, simulating a mission to Mars, spill out to cheers and applause.</p>

<p>Anca Selariu, Ross Brockwell, Nathan Jones and team leader Kelly Haston have spent the past 378 days sealed inside the "Martian" habitat in Houston, Texas, part of NASA's research into what it will take to put humans on the Red Planet.&nbsp;</p>

<p>They have been growing vegetables, conducting "Marswalks," and operating under what NASA terms "additional stressors" -- such as communication delays with "Earth", including their families; isolation and confinement.&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-media-max-width="560">

<p>It's the kind of experience that would make anyone who lived through pandemic lockdowns shudder -- but all four were beaming as they reemerged Saturday, their hair slightly more unruly and their emotion apparent.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Hello. It's actually so wonderful just to be able to say hello to you," Haston, a biologist, said with a laugh.</p>

<p>"I really hope I don't cry standing up here in front of all of you," Jones, an emergency room doctor, said as he took to the microphone -- and nearly doing just that several moments later as he spotted his wife in the crowd.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The habitat, dubbed Mars Dune Alpha, is a 3D printed 1,700 square-foot (160 square-meter) facility, complete with bedrooms, a gym, common areas, and a vertical farm to grow food.</p>

<p>An outdoor area, separated by an airlock, is filled with red sand and is where the team donned suits to conduct their "Marswalks", though it is still covered rather than being open air.</p>

<p>"They have spent more than a year in this habitat conducting crucial science, most of it nutrition-based and how that impacts their performace ... as we prepare to send people on to the Red Planet," Steve Koerner, deputy director at NASA's Johnson Space Center, told the crowd.</p>

<p>"I'm very appreciative."</p>

<p>This mission is the first of a series of three planned by NASA, grouped under the title CHAPEA -- Crew Health and Performance Exploration Analog.</p>

<p>A year-long mission simulating life on Mars took place in 2015-2016 in a habitat in Hawaii, and although NASA participated in it, it was not at the helm.</p>

<p>Under its Artemis program, America plans to send humans back to the Moon in order to learn how to live there long-term to help prepare a trip to Mars, sometime towards the end of the 2030s.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thousands of protesters marched Saturday in Barcelona to denounce mass tourism and its effect on Spain's most visited city, the latest in a series of similar marches in the country.</p>

<p>Under the slogan "Enough! Let's put limits on tourism", some 2,800 people -- according to police -- marched along a waterfront district of Barcelona to demand a new economic model that would reduce the millions of tourists that visit every year.</p>

<p>"I have nothing against tourism, but here in Barcelona we are suffering from an excess of tourism that has made our city unliveable," said Jordi Guiu, a 70-year-old sociologist.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With banners saying "Reduce tourism now!", the protesters chanted slogans such as "Tourists out of our neighbourhood", stopping in front of hotels to the surprise of visitors.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Barcelona's rising cost of housing, up 68 percent in the past decade according to local authorities, is one of the main issues for the movement, along with the effects of tourism on local commerce and working conditions in the city of 1.6 million inhabitants. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Local shops are closing to make way for stores that do not serve the needs of neighbourhoods. People cannot afford their rents," said Isa Miralles, a 35-year-old musician who lives in the Barceloneta district.</p>

<p>The northeastern coastal city, with internationally famous sites such as La Sagrada Familia, received more than 12 million tourists last year, according to local authorities. &nbsp;</p>

<p>To combat the "negative effects of mass tourism", the city council run by the Socialist Jaume Collboni announced 10 days ago that it was banning tourist apartment rentals -- there are now more than 10,000 -- by 2028 so that they can be put back on the local housing market.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The announcement could lead to a legal battle and is opposed by an association of tourist apartments who say it will just feed the black market.</p>

<p>The Barcelona protests come after similar demonstrations in tourist hotspots such as Malaga, Palma de Mallorca and the Canary Islands.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Israel carried out deadly airstrikes in Gaza Saturday, including one on a UN-run school that killed 16 people according to the Hamas-run authorities, and as violence also gripped its northern border with Lebanon.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel carried out deadly airstrikes in Gaza Saturday, including one on a UN-run school that killed 16 people according to the Hamas-run authorities, and as violence also gripped its northern border with Lebanon.</p>

<p>The fighting raged as diplomatic efforts to halt the war, which enters its tenth month on Sunday, continued with Israel saying Friday it would send a delegation next week to continue talks with Qatari mediators.</p>

<p>In a statement announcing the move, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's spokesperson said "gaps" remained with Hamas on how to secure a ceasefire and hostage release deal.</p>

<p>That came after a delegation led by Israel's Mossad intelligence agency chief David Barnea held a first round of talks with mediators in Doha.</p>

<p>"It was agreed that next week Israeli negotiators will travel to Doha to continue the talks. There are still gaps between the parties," the spokesperson said.</p>

<p>There has been no truce since a one-week pause in November during which 80 Israeli hostages were freed in return for 240 Palestinians held in Israeli prisons.</p>

<p>The war continued unabated, with Hamas-run Gaza's health ministry saying 16 people were killed in a strike on a school run by UNRWA, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, that was sheltering displaced people in Nuseirat in central Gaza.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said its aircraft had targeted "terrorists" operating around the Al-Jawni school.</p>

<p>The military earlier said it had conducted operations across much of the Gaza Strip, including Shujaiya in the north, Deir al-Balah in central Gaza and Rafah in the south.</p>

<p>Shujaiya is among the areas the military had previously declared to be cleared of Hamas, but where fighting is again taking place.</p>

<p>Paramedics on Saturday reported 10 deaths in a separate air strike on a house in Nuseirat refugee camp.</p>

<p>The Hamas press office and paramedics said four journalists working for local media outlets were killed in strikes overnight, and UNRWA said two of its employees had been killed.</p>

<p>UNRWA, which coordinates much of the aid delivered to Gaza, says 194 of its employees have been killed in the war.</p>

<h3><strong>'Ball in Israel's court'</strong></h3>

<p>The United States, which has mediated talks alongside Qatar and Egypt, has talked up the prospects of a deal saying there is a "pretty significant opening" for both sides.</p>

<p>US President Joe Biden announced a pathway to a truce deal in May that he said had been proposed by Israel.</p>

<p>This included an initial six-week truce, Israeli withdrawal from Gaza population centres and the freeing of hostages by Hamas.</p>

<p>Talks subsequently stalled, but a US official said Thursday that a new proposal from Hamas "moves the process forward and may provide the basis for closing the deal".</p>

<p>Senior Hamas official Osama Hamdan told AFP that new ideas from the group had been "conveyed by the mediators to the American side, which welcomed them and passed them on to the Israeli side. Now the ball is in the Israeli court."</p>

<p>Pressure has mounted domestically for a hostage release deal, with regular protests and rallies in Israel.</p>

<p>"It's important that we reach a deal so that all the mothers can embrace their children and husbands, just as I hug my mother every morning now," rescued hostage Almog Mair Jan said in a recorded message to a rally in Tel Aviv Saturday.</p>

<p>The war began with Hamas's unprecedented October 7 attack on southern Israel that resulted in the deaths of 1,195 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures. Hamas also seized hostages, 116 of whom remain in Gaza including 42 the military says are dead.</p>

<p>In response, Israel has carried out a military offensive that has killed at least 38,098 people in Gaza, also mostly civilians, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-ruled territory.</p>

<p>The war has uprooted 90 percent of Gaza's population, destroyed much of its housing and other infrastructure, and left almost 500,000 people enduring "catastrophic" hunger, UN agencies say.</p>

<p>The main stumbling block to a truce deal has been Hamas's demand for a permanent end to the fighting, which Netanyahu and his far-right coalition partners strongly reject.</p>

<p>The veteran hawk demands the release of the hostages and insists the war will not end until Israel has destroyed Hamas's ability to fight or govern.</p>

<h3><strong>Sirens and air strikes</strong></h3>

<p>Israel and Lebanon's Iran-backed Hezbollah movement have exchanged cross-border fire almost daily since the Gaza war began, but attacks have escalated over the past month.</p>

<p>This has raised fears of a major conflagration between the staunch enemies that could draw in others including Iran.</p>

<p>Early Saturday, sirens blared over northern Israel and the military said it had downed a "suspicious aerial target" and two "hostile aircraft" launched from Lebanon hit open ground.</p>

<p>The military said earlier it had attacked "a number of Hezbollah terror targets in southern Lebanon" overnight, all near the border.</p>

<p>A source close to Hezbollah said an Israeli drone strike targeted a vehicle in eastern Lebanon Saturday, killing an official from Hezbollah. Israel said he was part of the group's air defence unit.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Labour Party candidate's landslide victory in the UK general elections sparked celebrations thousands of kilometres away in Uttar Pradesh's Kanpur and Gorakhpur.</p>

<p>Navendu Mishra, elected to the House of Commons for a second consecutive term from the Stockport constituency, was born in Kanpur in 1989. His mother's paternal home is in Gorakhpur.</p>

<p>Mr Mishra's maternal uncle Nilendar Pandey, a social worker and businessman who now lives in Lucknow, told PTI that some people in Gorakhpur, Lucknow and Kanpur celebrated his victory by distributing sweets and setting off crackers.</p>

<p>Mr Pandey said Mr Mishra left for the UK with his parents when he was four years old. His father was a marketing manager for Indian Petrochemicals Corporation Limited and moved to the UK after taking charge of a British company.</p>

<p>Mr Mishra grew up in the UK with his brother and a sister.</p>

<p>He entered politics after completing his studies in London and was elected to the House of Commons in the 2019 elections on a Labour Party ticket from Stockport.</p>

<p>Mr Pandey said, "He (Mishra) likes coming to India. He is always keen on doing something for his country." "He visits India once every year or two and makes it a point to visit relatives from Gorakhpur to Delhi. He is a vegetarian and loves home-cooked food common in eastern Uttar Pradesh," he said.</p>

<p>Praising his nephew, Pandey said, "You can guess his popularity by his victory margin. In the UK, where elections are won by margins of only 1,000-2,000 votes, Mishra won by about 16,000 votes."</p>

<p>Mr Mishra secured 21,787 of the votes cast. His closest contender, Reform UK candidate Lynn Schofield, got 6,517 votes.</p>

<p>Mr Pandey said Mr Mishra returned to India for the first time after about seven years in the UK and spent time at the home of his maternal grandparents in Gorakhpur.</p>

<p>"Mishra used to fly kites and play cricket in the streets with the children of locals, including my two sons and daughter. My children are also ecstatic over his victory," he added.</p>

<p>During a recent visit to India, Mr Mishra led a delegation to meet Gujarat Chief Minister Bhupendra Patel. The delegation also met External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar in Delhi.</p>

<p>Following this, he spent time with his family in Delhi and Lucknow, Mr Pandey said.</p>

<p>Political experts claimed that Mr Mishra's victory and his connection with India would strengthen bilateral relations and cultural, political and social ties between the two nations.</p>

<p>Mr Pandey said Mr Mishra had also planned to visit the Ram temple in Ayodhya but that programme did not materialise.</p>

<p>Ishwar Singh, an associate of Mr Pandey in Gorakhpur, told PTI, "Mishra was inspired to join politics and social service by his maternal uncle Nilendar Pandey."</p>

<p>"When he visited Gorakhpur at a young age, he used to see the crowds gathering to meet Pandey and got inspired," he added.</p>

<p>Mr Mishra's paternal home in Kanpur's Arya Nagar was also teeming with locals, gathered to congratulated the family on his second successive election victory.</p>

<p>Mr Mishra last visited his family home in Arya Nagar about two years ago.</p>

<p>On Friday, Keir Starmer became the UK's new prime minister after his Labour Party secured a landslide victory in a general election in which weary voters inflicted a "sobering verdict" on Rishi Sunak-led Conservatives.</p>

<p>The Labour Party secured 412 seats in the 650-member House of Commons. Mr Sunak's Conservatives won just 121 seats.</p>

<p>Discussing plans to invite his nephew to India, Mr Pandey said, "We have invited Mishra to come here soon and a welcome ceremony will be organised in Lucknow after his arrival."&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hamas has accepted a US proposal to begin talks on releasing Israeli hostages, including soldiers and men, 16 days after the first phase of an agreement aimed at ending the Gaza war, a senior Hamas source told Reuters on Saturday.</p>

<p>The Hamas group has dropped a demand that Israel first commit to a permanent ceasefire before signing the agreement, and would allow negotiations to achieve that throughout the six-week first phase, the source told Reuters on condition of anonymity because the talks are private.</p>

<p>A Palestinian official close to the internationally mediated peace efforts had said the proposal could lead to a framework agreement if embraced by Israel and would end the nine-month-old war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.</p>

<p>A source in Israel's negotiating team, speaking on condition of anonymity, said on Friday there was now a real chance of achieving agreement. That was in sharp contrast to past instances in the nine-month-old war in Gaza, when Israel said conditions attached by Hamas were unacceptable.</p>

<p>A spokesperson for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Saturday, the Jewish Sabbath. On Friday his office said talks would continue next week and emphasised that gaps between the sides still remained.</p>

<p>The conflict has claimed the lives of more than 38,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza health officials, since Hamas attacked southern Israeli cities on Oct. 7, killing 1,200 people and taking some 250 hostages, according to official Israeli figures.</p>

<p>The new proposal ensures that mediators would guarantee a temporary ceasefire, aid delivery and the withdrawal of Israeli troops as long as indirect talks continue to implement the second phase of the agreement, the Hamas source said.</p>

<p>Efforts to secure a ceasefire and hostage release in Gaza have intensified over the past few days with active shuttle diplomacy among Washington, Israel and Qatar, which is leading mediation efforts from Doha, where the exiled Hamas leadership is based.</p>

<p>A regional source said the US administration was trying hard to secure a deal before the presidential election in November.</p>

<p>Netanyahu said on Friday that the head of Israel's Mossad intelligence agency had returned from an initial meeting with mediators in Qatar and that negotiations would continue next week.</p>

<p>Some families of hostages on Saturday gave a statement to reporters ahead of a weekly hostage rally in Tel Aviv, in which they called on Netanyahu to go through with the deal.</p>

<p>"For the first time in many months, we feel hope," said Einav Zangauker, the mother of Matan Zangauker, 24, who was abducted from his kibbutz home on Oct. 7. "This is an opportunity that cannot be missed," she said.</p>

<p><strong>Fighting Rages</strong></p>

<p>Meanwhile, Israeli forces stepped up military strikes across the enclave, killing at least 29 Palestinians in the past 24 hours, and wounding 100 others, the territory's health officials said.</p>

<p>Among those killed in separate air strikes were five local journalists, raising the death count of journalists since Oct 7 to 158, according to the Hamas-led Gaza government media office.</p>

<p>Israeli forces, which have deepened their incursions into Rafah, near the border with Egypt, killed four Palestinian policemen and wounded eight others, in an air strike on their vehicle on Saturday, health officials said.</p>

<p>A statement issued by the Hamas-run interior ministry said the four included Fares Abdel-Al, the head of the police force in western Rafah neighbourhood of Tel Al-Sultan.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said forces continued "intelligence-base operations" in Rafah, destroyed several underground structures, seized weapons and equipment, and killed several Palestinian gunmen.</p>

<p>Israel said its operations in Rafah aimed to eradicate the last Hamas armed wing battalions.</p>

<p>In the central Al-Nuseirat camp, one of the enclave's eight historic refugee camps, an Israeli air strike on a house killed 10 Palestinians, medics said.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said it eliminated a Hamas rocket cell that operated from inside a humanitarian-designated area. It said it carried out a precise strike after taking measures to ensure civilians were unharmed. Hamas denies Israeli accusations it uses civilian properties for military purposes.</p>

<p>The armed wings of Hamas and the Islamic Jihad said fighters attacked Israeli forces in several areas of the enclave by anti-tank rockets and mortar bombs.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Britain's Conservative Party, thrashed by Labour at the general election, on Saturday faced the task of rebuilding as leading right wingers warned it could face extinction unless it starts listening to its core voters.</p>

<p>A record number of ex-prime minister Rishi Sunak's top team and other prominent Tories lost their seats in Thursday's electoral drubbing.</p>

<p>The anti-immigration Reform UK party led by Brexit firebrand Nigel Farage maximised the damage by splitting the right-wing vote and picking up former Tory supporters in key constituencies.</p>

<p>Even before campaigning had ended, one ex-minister had launched an excoriating attack on the party for not grasping that "our failure to unite the right would destroy us".</p>

<p>Former interior minister Suella Braverman, seen as a leadership contender, correctly predicted the Tories would haemorrhage votes to Reform.</p>

<p>"Why? Because we failed to cut immigration or tax or deal with the net-zero and woke policies we have presided over for 14 years," she wrote in the Daily Telegraph.</p>

<p>Conceding inevitable defeat, she called for a "searingly honest post-match analysis", adding that it would "decide whether our party continues to exist at all".</p>

<p>Major British political parties have seen dramatic downturns in their fortunes before.</p>

<p>In the years after World War I, a divided Liberal Party found itself supplanted by the Labour Party as the main opposition.</p>

<p>The party of 19th century political giant William Gladstone and World War I leader David Lloyd George never again regained its earlier status as a party of government.</p>

<p><strong>'New movement'</strong></p>

<p>Other senior party voices to deliver an early diagnosis of the Conservatives' current predicament included David Frost, chief Brexit negotiator under ex-PM Boris Johnson.</p>

<p>David Frost resigned from government in December 2021, citing Johnson's tax hikes and net zero commitments among other complaints.</p>

<p>To revive traditional Conservative values and electability "after the cataclysm", he called for the creation of a "new movement for "reformed conservatism".</p>

<p>Sunak has said he will stay on as party leader until arrangements are put in place to choose a successor amid fears the party will now descend into bitter infighting.</p>

<p>Potential leadership candidates who managed to hang on to their seats include former home secretaries Braverman and Priti Patel. Former finance minister Jeremy Hunt became the first to rule himself out on Saturday telling GB News that "the time had passed".</p>

<p>"There's going to be a very immediate issue around how to relate to Nigel Farage," Michael Kenny, director of the Bennett Institue for Public Policy at the University of Cambridge, told AFP.</p>

<p>He said there would be a push to find a leadership candidate who could unite the party but "not provide an opening to Farage".</p>

<p>Others may look for someone potentially "more open to the idea of fusing with Reform".</p>

<p>Kenny said what had been unusual about this election was the way the "battle for the soul of the party" had been started before a single vote was cast.</p>

<p>With the Conservatives scoring a record low of just 121 seats, handing Starmer's government a majority in parliament of more than 170, some have predicted Labour could be in power for a generation.</p>

<p><strong>'Civil war'</strong></p>

<p>However, Philip Cowley, professor of politics at Queen Mary University of London, cautioned against too much pessimism.</p>

<p>He said people had been "writing off" one or more of the main parties ever since the early 1960s, when it was claimed demographics meant Labour could never win again "only for them to do so in 1964", he told AFP.</p>

<p>In 1992, after the Conservatives won their fourth consecutive victory, there was again "lots of talk about how Britain was now a one-party state, only for Labour to go on to win their greatest ever landslide five years later", Cowley added.</p>

<p>More recently, he noted, commentators suggested the Conservatives could never win again during the tenures of former Labour leaders Tony Blair and Gordon Brown.</p>

<p>"And yet they did," in 2010 with David Cameron.</p>

<p>London School of Economics political expert Tony Travers said the Conservative Party was the "world's most durable political party" in many ways but that the result was still a "disaster".</p>

<p>While "not a massive amount of difference" stood between Labour and the Conservatives on many policies, Labour had managed to look more centrist and moderate to the electorate, he added.</p>

<p>And divisions that had beset the party could prove a major obstacle to reinventing itself, Travers said.</p>

<p>"They were split after Brexit... there's a civil war going on all the time, which is going to make their life difficult in the coming parliament."</p>

<p>Offering his own analysis in the Daily Mail on Saturday, Tory ex-prime minister Boris Johnson highlighted that Labour's landslide majority was built on fewer votes than it secured in 2019 when the Conservatives under Johnson won an 80-seat majority.</p>

<p>"We are capable of endless regeneration," he said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The death count from floods in Bangladesh this week has risen to eight, leaving more than two million affected after heavy rains caused major rivers to burst their banks, officials confirmed Saturday.</p>

<p>The South Asian nation of 170 million people, crisscrossed by hundreds of rivers, has seen more frequent floods in recent decades.</p>

<p>Climate change has made rainfall more erratic and melting glaciers upstream in the Himalayan mountains.</p>

<p>Two teenage boys were killed when a boat capsized in flood waters in Shahjadur, the northern rural town's police chief Sabuj Rana told AFP.</p>

<p>"There were nine people in the small boat. Seven swam to safety. Two boys did not know how to swim. They drowned," he said.</p>

<p>Bishwadeb Roy, a police chief in Kurigram, told AFP that three others had been killed in two separate electrocution incidents after their boats became entangled with live electricity wires in flood water.</p>

<p>Another three died in separate flood-related incidents around the country, officials told AFP earlier this week.</p>

<p>The government said it has opened hundreds of shelters for people displaced by the waters and sent food and relief to hard-hit districts in the country's north region.</p>

<p>"More than two million people have been affected by the floods. Seventeen of the country's 64 districts have been affected," Kamrul Hasan, the secretary of the country's disaster management ministry, told AFP.</p>

<p>Hasan said the flood situation may worsen in the north over the coming days with the Brahmaputra, one of Bangladesh's main waterways, flowing above danger levels in some areas.</p>

<p>In the worst-hit Kurigram district, eight out of nine rural towns have been marooned by flood water, local disaster and relief official Abdul Hye told AFP.</p>

<p>"We live with floods here. But this year the water was very high. In three days, Brahmaputra rose by six to eight feet (2-2.5 metres)," Abdul Gafur, a local councillor in the district, told AFP.</p>

<p>"Flood water has inundated more than 80 percent of homes in my area. We are trying to deliver food, especially rice and edible oil. But there is a drinking water crisis."</p>

<p>Bangladesh is in the middle of the annual summer monsoon, which brings South Asia 70-80 percent of its annual rainfall, as well as regular deaths and destruction due to flooding and landslides.</p>

<p>The rainfall is hard to forecast and varies considerably, but scientists say climate change is making the monsoon stronger and more erratic.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Describing it as "a project for posterity," India on Saturday donated digital equipment, including 2,000 Tabs, worth Rs 300 million for use to 200 schools in the southern province of Sri Lanka.</p>

<p>A ceremony in the southern district of Galle, attended by President Ranil Wickremesinghe and Indian High Commissioner Santosh Jha, marked a significant step towards educational modernisation, with the provision of 200 Smart Classrooms and 2,000 Tabs to 200 schools in the Southern Province.</p>

<p>"Following a request by the Minister of Health and Industry, Dr Ramesh Pathirana, the Government of India allocated Rs 300 million to the Southern Provincial Council for this project. Of the 200 selected schools, 150 are in the Galle district, while the remaining 50 are in the Hambantota and Matara districts," a statement from the President's Media Division (PMD) said.</p>

<p>Additionally, 2,000 Tabs were distributed, with each of the 200 classrooms receiving 10 Tabs, the statement said.</p>

<p>"We deeply appreciate the support extended by neighbouring India in advancing modern technology. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has expressed interest in establishing an Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) campus in Sri Lanka, which is highly appreciated," Mr Wickremesinghe said.</p>

<p>"Additionally, negotiations to enhance cooperation in the energy sector with India are progressing successfully," he said.</p>

<p>Pathirana and Minister of Education Dr Susil Premajayantha, both appreciated India's assistance in their respective speeches.</p>

<p>Mr Premajayantha also said, "Today, 200 schools in the Southern Province have been equipped with comfortable classrooms and 2,000 Tabs. Moving forward, the schools will undergo digitisation, with 1,250 schools already being connected."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mr Jha reciprocated by saying: "As India's neighbour, we consistently extend support to Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka holds a crucial position in our foreign policy. India remains steadfast in its commitment to providing essential infrastructure and technical knowledge support to Sri Lanka."&nbsp;</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Britain's new Labour Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Saturday said he was "not prepared" to continue with the previous Conservative government's flagship scheme to deport migrants to Rwanda.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Newly elected UK prime minister Keir Starmer on Saturday began his first full day in charge declaring the ousted Tories' plan to deport migrants to Rwanda "dead and buried" and pledging growth as his government's "number one mission".</p>

<p>The Labour leader on Friday won a landslide election victory bringing to a close 14 years of Conservative rule.</p>

<p>He said he was "restless for change" and that his party had received a "mandate to do politics differently".</p>

<p>Keir Starmer started the day with a first meeting of his cabinet including Britain's first woman finance minister Rachel Reeves and new foreign minister David Lammy.</p>

<p>"We have a huge amount of work to do, so now we get on with our work," he told his top team to applause and smiles around the cabinet table.</p>

<p>At a news conference afterwards he said he would not be proceeding with former Conservative prime minister Rishi Sunak's controversial scheme to tackle rising small boat arrivals on England's southern coast by deporting migrants to Rwanda.</p>

<p>"The Rwanda scheme was dead and buried before it started... I'm not prepared to continue with gimmicks that don't act as a deterrent," he told reporters at his 10 Downing Street office.</p>

<p><strong>'Driving growth'</strong></p>

<p>Keir Starmer spent his first hours in Downing Street on Friday appointing his ministerial team, hours after securing his centre-left party's return to power with a whopping 174-seat majority in the UK parliament.</p>

<p>Notable lower-ranking appointments included Patrick Vallance, chief scientific government adviser during the Covid-19 pandemic, who has been made a science minister.</p>

<p>James Timpson, whose shoe repair company employs ex-offenders, was also made a prisons minister.</p>

<p>Keir Starmer said both new ministers were people "associated with change" and illustrated his determination to deliver concrete improvements to people's lives.</p>

<p>Work on "driving growth" had already begun, he said, adding that he had told his ministers "exactly what I expect of them in terms of standards, delivery, and the trust that the country has put in them".</p>

<p><strong>NATO support 'unshakable'</strong></p>

<p>Flag-waving crowds of cheering Labour activists on Friday welcomed Keir Starmer to Downing Street hours after his victory.</p>

<p>But daunting challenges await his government, including a stagnating economy, creaking public services and households suffering from a years-long cost-of-living crisis.</p>

<p>World leaders lined up to congratulate the new British premier.</p>

<p>Keir Starmer spoke by telephone with US President Joe Biden and "discussed their shared commitment to the special relationship between the UK and US and their aligned ambitions for greater economic growth", according to London.</p>

<p>He also spoke to President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky, and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.</p>

<p>However, former -- and potentially future -- US president Donald Trump ignored Keir Starmer, instead hailing the five-seat electoral breakthrough of his ally Nigel Farage's far-right Reform UK party.</p>

<p>Keir Starmer will make his debut on the international stage as leader when he flies to Washington next week for a NATO summit.</p>

<p>"It is for me to be absolutely clear that the first duty of my government is security and defence, to make clear our unshakable support of Nato," he said.</p>

<p>He added that he had reiterated the support of the UK and its allies for Ukraine to Zelensky.</p>

<p><strong>Infighting fears</strong></p>

<p>The election saw Labour near its record of 418 seats under ex-leader Tony Blair in 1997 by winning 412.</p>

<p>The Conservatives suffered their worst-ever defeat, capturing just 121 constituencies, prompting Rishi Sunak to apologise to the nation and confirm that he will resign as Tory leader once arrangements are in place to select a successor.</p>

<p>A record 12 senior ex-government ministers lost their seats, alongside former prime minister Liz Truss, whose economically calamitous short-lived tenure in 2022 wounded the party irreparably ahead of the election.</p>

<p>It is now poised for another period of infighting between a moderate wing eager for a centrist leader and those who may even be willing to court Farage as a new figurehead.</p>

<p>The election also saw the centrist Liberal Democrats make their biggest gains in around a century, claiming more than 70 seats.</p>

<p>But it was a dismal contest for the pro-independence Scottish National Party, which was virtually obliterated in Scotland. It dropped from 48 seats to just nine.</p>

<p>The Green Party had its best general election, quadrupling its MPs count to four.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, an unprecedented six independent lawmakers were elected -- four of them defeating Labour candidates in districts with large Muslim populations and campaigns centred around the Israel-Hamas conflict.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Indian-origin former Conservative Party member of Parliament Alok Sharma, who had chosen not to seek re-election in this weeks general election, will now take his seat in the House of Lords.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Indian-origin former Conservative Party member of Parliament Alok Sharma, who had chosen not to seek re-election in this week's general election, will now take his seat in the House of Lords after being conferred a peerage by King Charles III.</p>

<p>The 56-year-old Agra-born MP, who was knighted as Sir Alok in the King's New Year's Honours list last year for his contribution to tackling climate change through his leadership as president of the COP26 climate summit over two years ago, now becomes Lord Sharma.</p>

<p>Sharma was among seven nominations made by outgoing prime minister Rishi Sunak for his customary “Dissolution Peerages,” which also saw former Prime Minister Theresa May become a peer in the Upper House of the UK Parliament.</p>

<p>“Humbled to have been appointed to the House of Lords but so sorry to see many fine Conservative candidates lose, including in Reading West &amp; Mid Berkshire,” said Sharma in a post on X on Friday, as his party's disastrous general election results became evident.</p>

<p>His former constituency was won by Labour's Olivia Bailey, who Sharma described as a “decent person who I feel will serve the area diligently.” Sharma's Reading West constituency, like several others across the UK, had undergone a boundary change to become Reading West &amp; Mid Berkshire.</p>

<p>“This has not been an easy decision for me. It has been the honour of my life to serve as the MP for a constituency in the town where I grew up and a privilege to serve in government and represent the UK on the international stage,” Sharma said, when he announced his decision in September last year to not contest the next general election.</p>

<p>“I will continue to support my Conservative colleagues and serve my constituents diligently for the remainder of my time as an MP, as well as champion in Parliament the causes I care deeply about, especially climate action,” he added.</p>

<p>Sharma was selected as a parliamentary candidate in 2006 and has served as a Tory MP since 2010. In his role as Cabinet minister since then, he has been appointed Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy and International Development until he was conferred a Cabinet-level role as COP26 president by former PM Boris Johnson in January 2021.</p>

<p>Under Rishi Sunak as prime minister, he was on the House of Commons back benches and often spoke out to express his concerns about the government's delay in certain targets towards meeting the country's climate action Net Zero pledge by 2050.</p>

<p>“Chopping and changing policies creates uncertainty for businesses and the public. Ultimately this makes it more difficult to attract investment and pushes up costs for consumers,” he said.</p>

<p>Sharma was among a series of high-profile Tory colleagues, including former defence secretary Ben Wallace, who had decided not to seek re-election in the 2024 polls.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>India-Iran partnership in various sectors, including connectivity, has expanded tremendously in recent times, especially during the tenure of Iran's late President Seyyed Ebrahim Raisi who passed away in a helicopter crash in May this year.</p>

<p>India had also observed a day's state mourning as a mark of respect to the late Iranian President and other eight people, including the country's Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, who lost their lives in the tragic accident.</p>

<p>It was also under India's presidency that Iran joined the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO).</p>

<p>Both countries have fast-tracked infrastructure cooperation, focusing especially on the Chabahar project and the International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC) - the 7,200 km-long multimodal trade corridor linking Russia with India via the ports of Iran.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As a mark of reverence on the 89th birthday of His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama, an icon of ahimsa (non-violence) and karuna (compassion), on Saturday, 'Never Forget Tibet: The Dalai Lama's Untold Story' was released worldwide.</p>

<p>The documentary, directed by Jean-Paul Mertinez, explores details of the Nobel Peace Laureate's incredible escape into exile for the first time on film in his own words, with the Indian political officer who led him to safety -- late Havildar Mander Singh.</p>

<p>Featuring the Tibetan community in exile and those with historic ties to Tibet, the film explores the Dalai Lama's compassion for a world seemingly in crisis today and seeks to find out what can be learnt from his inspirational life story, Tibetan culture and its ancient spirituality.</p>

<p>Inspired by the book 'An Officer and His Holiness' by Rani Singh, the film is narrated by British acting legend Hugh Bonneville (Downton Abbey, Paddington) and features music from Grammy-nominated artist Anoushka Shankar.</p>

<p>The film is produced by Compassionate Films and the Executive Producers are Templeheart Films, Lyndon Baldock, Gavin Patterson and Rani Singh.</p>

<p>The worldwide digital release has been made possible with the collaboration of The Italian Buddhist Union, Rome, Italy.</p>

<p>The feature-length documentary will be available on world's leading streaming platforms, including Apple TV , Amazon and Google Play.</p>

<p>In 1959, the occupying Chinese troops suppressed the Tibetan national uprising in Lhasa and forced the 14th Dalai Lama and over 80,000 Tibetans into exile in India and neighbouring countries.</p>

<p>On reaching India after a three-week-long and treacherous journey, the Dalai Lama first took up residence for about a year in Mussoorie in Uttarakhand.</p>

<p>On March 10, 1960, just before moving to Dharamsala, which also serves as the headquarters of the exiled Tibetan establishment, the Dalai Lama said: "For those of us in exile, I said that our priority must be resettlement and the continuity of our cultural traditions. We, Tibetans, would eventually prevail in regaining freedom for Tibet."</p>

<p>Currently, the government-in-exile is based in Dharamsala, a town in Himalayan foothills where a community of Tibetans lives in exile with the Dalai Lama, hoping to sustain their struggle to secure complete autonomy in their Chinese-ruled homeland, Tibet.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Britain's newly-elected Prime Minister Keir Starmer spoke to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday morning and said he stood ready to conclude a Free Trade Agreement that worked for both sides, Downing Street said.</p>

<p>India and the UK have been negotiating a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) for over two years with a Conservative Party-led government but the talks were stalled in the 14th round amidst the general election cycles in both countries.</p>

<p>It is now expected to be picked up by the new Starmer-led Labour government, which was voted in with a landslide this week.</p>

<p>According to the Downing Street readout of the newly-elected UK Prime Minister's Indo-Pacific-related international calls on Saturday, the call with Modi seems to have been the first followed by Japan and Australia.</p>

<p>"The leaders exchanged congratulations on their respective election wins, and reflected on the strength of the relationship between the UK and India," a Downing Street spokesperson said.</p>

<p>"Discussing the Free Trade Agreement, the Prime Minister said he stood ready to conclude a deal that worked for both sides. The leaders hoped to meet at the earliest opportunity," the spokesperson added.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Pleased to speak with <a href="https://twitter.com/Keir_Starmer?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Keir_Starmer</a>. Congratulated him on being elected as the Prime Minister of the UK.

<p>Both sides have been working towards clinching a pact to enhance the GBP 38.1 billion bilateral trading partnership since January 2022, when Boris Johnson was the British prime minister.</p>

<p>The talks have since had to contend with political turmoil in the UK that first led to a short-lived Liz Truss premiership followed by Rishi Sunak as Britain's first prime minister of Indian heritage.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The world organisation has warned of a “heightened risk of a full-scale war” along the Lebanon-Israel border where 901 Indian peacekeepers are deployed.</p>

<p>“The UN is deeply concerned at the increase in the intensity of exchanges of fire across the Blue Line yesterday, which heightens the risk of a full-scale war”, Secretary-General Antonio Guterres's spokesperson's office said on Friday.</p>

<p>“Escalation can and must be avoided. We reiterate that the danger of miscalculation leading to a sudden and wider conflagration is real,” it added.</p>

<p>After an Israeli drone killed a senior commander of the Hezbollah in Southern Lebanon on Wednesday, the militia responded by sending a barrage of 100 rockets into Israel.</p>

<p>The well-entrenched Hezbollah, which has the backing of Iran has threatened to continue attacks on Israel in solidarity with Hamas under Israeli assault in Gaza.</p>

<p>The decades-long tensions in the area have intensified since October 7 when Hamas attacked Israel, which launched a retribution on Gaza that it controls.</p>

<p>In solidarity with Hamas, Hezbollah said attacks on Israel till there is a ceasefire in Gaza, raising fears of a wider regional conflict.</p>

<p>Civilians have suffered the most from the volley of attacks between Hezbollah and Israel.</p>

<p>About 60,000 Lebanese have reportedly been displaced, and, according to United States Secretary of State Antony Blinken, about 20,000 Israelis have also been forced to flee the border areas because of the attacks.</p>

<p>“Israel has effectively lost its sovereignty in the northern quadrant of its country because people don't safe to go to their homes,” he said on Monday underscoring the risk of war.</p>

<p>He added that an agreement reached through diplomacy was needed to end the security risks and ensure that “forces are pulled back.”</p>

<p>The spokesperson's office also emphasised that a “political and diplomatic solution is the only viable way forward.”</p>

<p>The Indian peacekeepers are a part of the 10,000-strong 49-nation UN Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) charged by the Security Council to work with Lebanese national forces to keep order in the volatile section known as the Blue Line that separates Lebanon and Israel.</p>

<p>In effect, the mission also acts as a buffer between the two countries at times caught in the crossfire between Israel and Hezbollah.</p>

<p>The spokesperson's office said that the Foreign Affairs Committee of Lebanon's Parliament visited UNIFIL to express support for the mission and its mandate on Thursday.</p>

<p>Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert, the UN special coordinator for Lebanon met with Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri and caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati to emphasise “the need for de-escalation across the Blue Line,” it added.</p>

<p>Lebanon's writ is weak in the region where Hezbollah controls vast tracts of territory.</p>

<p>Mohammad Naameh Nasser, who Israel blamed for rockets into the country, was the second Hezbollah commander killed in less than a month.</p>

<p>Last month another Hezbollah commander, Taleb Abdallah, was killed by Israel in Southern Lebanon.</p>

<p>Hezbollah retaliated with about 150 rockets and drones, but international diplomacy kept it from further escalation.</p>

<p>At another peacekeeping mission in the region, the UN Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) charged with maintaining the ceasefire between Israel and Syria, 202 Indian troops are deployed.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Dalai Lama said on Saturday he is recovering from a knee surgery and feels "physically fit", brushing aside rumours of ill health on his 89th birthday.</p>

<p>"Recently I had surgery on my knee, which has given me some problem. However, I am recovering and have no problem at all now," the exiled spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhism said in a video message from the United States, where he is recuperating.</p>

<p>"There may be people trying to confuse you about my health, saying that the Dalai Lama has gone to a hospital and is undergoing treatments, and so on, making my condition sound grave. You don't need to trust such misinformation," he said.</p>

<p>A charismatic figure who popularised Buddhism internationally, the Dalai Lama won a Nobel Peace Prize in 1989 for keeping alive the Tibetan cause in exile. He fled to India in 1959, nine years after China sent troops into the Himalayan region in 1950, saying it was liberating Tibetan "serfs".</p>

<p>As the spiritual leader ages and battles health problems, the appointment of his successor has become a looming issue for Tibetans struggling for more autonomy in China or outright independence. Tibetan Buddhists believe that learned monastics are reincarnated after death as newborns.</p>

<p>The Dalai Lama has said he will clarify questions about succession - including whether and where he would be reincarnated - around his 90th birthday.</p>

<p>"I am nearly 90 now but I don't feel unhealthy, except for the slight discomfort in my legs. I would like to thank all my fellow Tibetans in and outside Tibet for your prayers on my birthday," he said, adding that some issues are part of ageing.</p>

<p>On Saturday, tens of thousands of Buddhists and well-wishers around the world are to gather to celebrate and pray for the long life of a leader who for them represents the strongest hope of an eventual return to Tibet.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Joe Biden fended off questions about his mental fitness and electability on Friday in a TV interview meant to draw a line under a disastrous debate performance that triggered calls for him to quit his re-election bid.</p>

<p>With rebellion brewing among some nervous Democratic voters, lawmakers and donors, the one-to-one with the ABC network was hyped as the most consequential of the 81-year-old president's long career.</p>

<p>But the 22-minute sit-down appeared to provide little reassurance, as Biden blamed sickness for his sub-par performance and repeatedly dismissed polling and fears within his party that the debate had gravely wounded his prospects.</p>

<p>"I was sick, I was feeling terrible... I just had a really bad cold," said the president, in his first unscripted remarks of any length since last week's showdown with Republican rival Donald Trump.</p>

<p>The interview was intended to help Biden weather the storm, but his hoarse voice and meandering answers drew immediate Democratic fire for appearing "out of touch."</p>

<p>Asked if staying in the race might jeopardize Democrats holding on to the White House, Biden said: "I don't think anybody's more qualified to be president or win this race than me."</p>

<p>He dodged calls to have doctors assess his mental acuity, saying that the duties of the presidency mean "I have a cognitive test every single day. Every day I have that test, everything I do."</p>

<p>The Trump campaign mockingly posted on social media that "Biden sounds great" as the broadcast went out, before concluding the president "is in denial and in decline."</p>

<p>The interview came after Biden was hesitant and often incoherent during the debate against Trump in Atlanta, leading to panic within his party and calls for him to pull out of the race.</p>

<p>- 'I'll beat Trump' -</p>

<p>The Biden campaign has pushed back hard on any suggestion he may withdraw and, just hours before the ABC interview, released an aggressive campaign travel schedule for the rest of July.</p>

<p>Appearing at a campaign rally in Madison, Wisconsin, the president delivered an energetic stump speech, unequivocally declaring, "I'm staying in the race. I'll beat Donald Trump."</p>

<p>Post-debate polls have shown a widening deficit in Trump's favor, and at least four Democrats in Congress have called on Biden to step aside, as have major newspapers, donors and a raft of Democratic-supporting political commentators.</p>

<p>Senate Intelligence Committee chairman Mark Warner and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries were both planning crisis talks with lawmakers in the coming days, US media reported.</p>

<p>In Friday's interview, ABC host George Stephanopoulos repeatedly referenced the growing Democratic clamor for a conversation on picking a new candidate, asking Biden if he would step down if convinced he couldn't beat Trump.</p>

<p>"Well, it depends. If the Lord Almighty comes down and tells me that, I might do that," he said.</p>

<p>Biden added that he had not watched the debate afterward, saying "I don't think I did, no."</p>

<p>And he dismissed the idea that his poor performance was a sign of a more serious health problem.</p>

<p>"It was a bad episode, no indication of any serious condition. I was exhausted. I didn't listen to my instincts in terms of preparing and -- and I had a bad night," Biden said.</p>

<p>David Axelrod, a top aide in Barack Obama's White House and an occasional thorn in the side of the Biden administration, said the interview showed a president "dangerously out of touch" with concerns over his fitness for office.</p>

<p>"Four years ago at this time, he was 10 points ahead of Trump (in polls). Today, he is six points behind," Axelrod posted on X.</p>

<p>The White House has announced Biden will visit Pennsylvania this weekend before holding a press conference during the NATO summit in Washington next week.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif would decide the fate of social media platforms such as YouTube, WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram and TikTok during the Muharram festival as the Punjab government sought a ban on them, citing the need to control "hate material".</p>

<p>Shia Muslims hold large gatherings during the festival to observe the martyrdom of the grandson of the prophet of Islam.</p>

<p>The Muslims generally observe his martyrdom as a symbol of resistance to tyranny, and the Shia Muslims take out rallies during the first ten days of Muharram which culminate into huge processions on the 9th and 10th of the month.</p>

<p>The Sunni Muslims have a historic theological rivalry with the Shias, and Pakistan's extremist Sunni groups brand them as heretics and target them through bombings, with Pakistan witnessing numerous such attacks in the past.</p>

<p>To disrupt communication among the militants, governments in Pakistan traditionally undertake elaborate security measures during Muharram, including suspension of internet, cell phone and social media services to avoid acts of terrorism.</p>

<p>The Punjab government had asked the federal government to suspend access to social media from July 6 to 11 to control the spread of misinformation and hate material to prevent sectarian violence.</p>

<p>This week, the provincial home department, through a letter to the Interior Ministry, recommended suspending "Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, YouTube, X, TikTok, etc. across the province".</p>

<p>The Ministry of Interior after a meeting held on Friday deferred a decision on the Punjab government's request, according to an overnight statement.</p>

<p>It stated that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif would make the final decision on the matter, adding that the requests of the provinces had "neither been rejected nor accepted".</p>

<p>The statement did not reveal which provinces other than Punjab had made such requests but indicated that Punjab was not the only one to have sought this.</p>

<p>Muharram is expected to begin on Sunday or Monday on the condition of the sighting of the moon.</p>

<p>Separately, a body of clerics tasked to sight the moon is meeting this evening to decide the beginning of Muharram.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[Gelsenkirchen, a city in western Germany, is temporarily renaming itself "Swiftkirchen" in honour of Taylor Swift's upcoming Eras Tour shows.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Gelsenkirchen, a city in western Germany, is temporarily renaming itself "Swiftkirchen" in honour of Taylor Swift's upcoming Eras Tour shows. The city's mayor, Karin Welge, approved the proposal ahead of the popstar's performances from July 17-19.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">Taylor Swift is set to perform at three concerts in Gelsenkirchen, and thousands of her fans, known as 'Swifties,' are expected to attend. The city is preparing for the events by putting up signs with the new name, which translates to “Swift's Church.”&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">The decision to temporarily change the city's name was taken after Aleshanee Westhoff from Emmerich, a fan of Taylor, started a petition and even wrote to Mayor Welge about this.</p>

<p dir="ltr">"It's a great idea to temporarily rename Gelsenkirchen to 'Swiftkirchen', which is why I'm particularly pleased that you can experience the short-term 'renaming' of Gelsenkirchen live and up close in Gelsenkirchen today," Mr Welge said in a letter to Westhoff, according to an official release.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Also, the first signage that marks the entrance to "Swiftkirchen" has also been installed by Westhoff on Ebertstrasse, the release stated.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Markus Schwardtmann, the head of the city's public relations department, said, "Today is the starting signal. We will be installing many more signs in highly frequented places in Gelsenkirchen in the coming days".</p>

<p dir="ltr">Besides, a "Taylor Swift tram" from Bogestra is already said to be on the road and will be making an attractive selfie motif, the release said, while highlighting the red frames that have been set up all over the city.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Taylor Swift will also receive her own stone on the Gelsenkirchen Walk of Fame, alongside local notables like soccer coach Rudi Assauer and writer Ilse Kibgis.</p>

<p dir="ltr">"There will be many small and large surprises so that the Swifties in Gelsenkirchen have a lot to discover," Mr Schwardtmann said.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Not just that, the German city will even be hosting a "big open-air Taylor Swift party,” which has been named “Taylor Town”. It will feature “lots of offers (swap market, karaoke, tattoos) related to the star."</p>

<p dir="ltr">"As mayor, I am of course very happy that Taylor Swift, currently the most successful singer in the world, will be performing three times in Gelsenkirchen. International attention will therefore be back on our city immediately after EURO 2024," Mayor Welge said in the official statement.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Taylor Swift is used to such adulation. At the beginning of the Eras Tour in March last year, Arizona's Glendale was temporarily renamed as “Swift City” in honour of the singer's tour stop in the city.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>
